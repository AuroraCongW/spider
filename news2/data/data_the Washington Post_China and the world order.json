China will make legitimate and necessary reactions,\u201d the statement said.China maintains consulates in San Francisco, Los Angeles, Chicago and New York in addition to its embassy in Washington.ADThe U.S. has four other consulates in China and an embassy in Beijing, keeping the sides in parity in terms of diplomatic missions.On Monday, pro-China protesters were escorted away from the shuttered consulate as workers covered over the building\u2019s exterior signs.\u201cLong live the Chinese people! Long live the Communist Party of China!\u201d one man shouted before a SWAT team escorted him away.ADAnother briefly flashed a shirt reading \u201cSLING OUT USA!\u201d in English before being taken away.Others expressed regret at the closure. An officer removed a bouquet of flowers that a woman had left at the curb across from the entrance to the consulate.Foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin told reporters at a daily briefing Monday that the shutdown was a \u201clegitimate and necessary response to the unreasonable act\u201d of the closure of the Houston consulate and the entry of U.S. authorities into it.AD\u201cWe urge the U.S. to immediately correct its mistakes and create necessary conditions for the relationship between the two countries to return to the normal track,\u201d Wang said.ADThe Chengdu consulate briefly came to prominence when the police chief of the nearby city of Chongqing fled there in 2012, precipitating the downfall of Chongqing\u2019s politically ambitious leader Bo Xilai in China\u2019s biggest political scandal in decades. It also played host to former Vice President Joe Biden during a visit when the current prospective Democratic Party presidential candidate was accompanied by China\u2019s now-leader Xi Jinping.Police closed off a two- to three-block area around the consulate on Monday morning, cutting off virtually any view of the property including the flag. A few vehicles were allowed through after police checks, and others could be seen moving in the distance.ADOfficers kept a close watch, even after re-opening the area in the afternoon, determined to prevent any sign of unrest.ADWorkers covered over the consulate signs on the wall outside shortly after the property was vacated. They included a bronze plaque near the entrance that a worker had tried to pry off the previous night, but without success.Moving activity on Sunday continued well beyond midnight, with flatbed trailers entering the complex and emerging later carrying large shipping containers.The impending closure of the consulate drew a steady stream of onlookers over the weekend as Chengdu, like Houston, found itself in the limelight of international politics.People stopped to take selfies and photos, some waving Chinese flags in a show of patriotism and others just capturing the moment. A man who tried to unfurl a large placard late Sunday that he called an open letter to the Chinese government was quickly escorted away.ADADThe U.S. alleged that the Houston consulate was a nest of Chinese spies who tried to steal data from facilities in Texas, including the Texas A&M medical system and the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston.

Instead, it has spurred investigations around the world into deal-making, election spending and political patronage under former Prime Minister Najib Razak. The figures are mind-boggling: Of the $8 billion that 1MDB raised via bond sales, the U.S. alleges more than half was siphoned off. Angry voters ousted Najib in a 2018 election that ended his party\u2019s 61 years of rule, and two years later he was convicted in the first of a series of trials. U.S. prosecutors have implicated at least three senior bankers from Goldman Sachs Group Inc., one of whom admitted to bribery. Malaysia, which had filed its own charges, reached a $3.9 billion settlement with the bank.Support our journalism. Subscribe today.arrow-right1. What is 1MDB?ADADIt\u2019s a government investment company -- full name, 1Malaysia Development Bhd -- that took shape in 2009 under Najib, who led its advisory board. Its early initiatives included buying privately owned power plants and planning a new financial district in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia\u2019s capital. The fund proved better at borrowing -- it accumulated $12 billion in debt -- than at luring large-scale foreign investment.2. What\u2019s the issue?Much of the money raised was allegedly embezzled. The U.S. Justice Department says more than $4.5 billion flowed from the fund through fraudulent shell companies to corrupt officials and their associates. According to the U.S. indictment, a small coterie of Malaysians, led by businessman Low Taek Jho (known as Jho Low), diverted money from 1MDB into personal accounts disguised to look like legitimate businesses, and kicked back some of those funds to officials. There were questions about a $681 million payment that landed in Najib\u2019s personal bank account (he has said most of the money was returned). Malaysia\u2019s then-attorney general cleared Najib of wrongdoing in 2016. But after losing office, Najib was charged with corruption, breach of trust and money laundering. The first trial involved $10 million deposited in his personal accounts from a former 1MDB unit. He was found guilty July 28 on all seven counts and sentenced to 12 years; his lawyer promised to appeal. Jho Low, a fugitive, has also denied any wrongdoing.ADAD3. Where\u2019s the money?Scattered, but slowly coming in. Under the July 24 settlement, Malaysia will drop all criminal charges against Goldman in exchange for a $2.5 billion cash payment and at least $1.4 billion from seized 1MDB assets being returned with the help of U.S. prosecutors and Goldman. (Goldman made $593 million working on three bond sales that raised $6.5 billion for 1MDB in 2012 and 2013 -- far more than what banks typically make from such deals.) An agreement to settle the U.S. charges with a possible $2 billion penalty was said to be awaiting a Justice Department decision on whether Goldman would have to accept its first-ever guilty plea. In addition:\u2022 U.S. prosecutors struck a deal in October with Jho Low to recoup almost $700 million worth of assets, including a Beverly Hills hotel and real estate in New York and London. That\u2019s in addition to $260 million of assets, including a $126 million super yacht, seized earlier on Malaysia\u2019s behalf.ADAD\u2022 The U.S. reached a $60 million settlement with the producers of \u201cThe Wolf of Wall Street,\u201d a 2013 movie allegedly funded with siphoned money. The production company was co-founded by Riza Aziz, Najib\u2019s stepson and a friend of Jho Low.\u2022 Malaysia is moving to seize $340 million in PetroSaudi International\u2019s accounts in London.\u2022 Singapore is returning S$35 million ($25 million) forfeited by former Goldman banker Roger Ng.4. Who\u2019s investigating?The U.S. Justice Department has been at the forefront of 1MDB investigations, focusing on bribery, theft and money laundering. According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, some potential witnesses were scared to talk because they feared retaliation. Several other countries also conducted probes. Singapore and Switzerland have fined some banks for lapses in anti-money laundering controls. Malaysia also has said it is looking into allegations that China offered to help fend off probes into 1MDB in the U.S. and elsewhere in exchange for stakes in infrastructure projects in Malaysia. A former Najib aide testified that the ex-premier offered projects to China in return for help resolving 1MDB\u2019s debt.ADAD5. Who else is charged?\u2022 Jho Low, a bon vivant who said he did consulting work for 1MDB, is portrayed by U.S. prosecutors as the central figure who set up shell companies to collect proceeds from the fund and arranged withdrawals for payoffs and for his own lavish spending. He has been charged in absentia in Malaysia and the U.S. with money laundering and other offenses. Malaysian police have bemoaned the lack of help from other jurisdictions in finding him, after saying they had located him and were in talks with a party they suspect of protecting him. Jho Low\u2019s settlement with the U.S. didn\u2019t include an admission of guilt or release him from criminal charges.\u2022 Goldman\u2019s former Southeast Asia Chairman Tim Leissner pleaded guilty to U.S. charges including conspiracy to launder money and admitted to bribing officials in Malaysia and the United Arab Emirates to get bond deals for Goldman. He agreed to forfeit $43.7 million and was scheduled to be sentenced on Jan. 22, 2021.ADAD\u2022 Ng was extradited from Malaysia to the U.S. to face similar charges. His trial start date was postponed until January 2021 by the coronavirus outbreak. (The U.S. Federal Reserve has banned both men from the financial industry.)\u2022 Malaysia leveled charges of securities law violations against Leissner, Ng, Jho Low and 1MDB\u2019s former general counsel, Jasmine Loo Ai Swan.\u2022 PetroSaudi International directors Tarek Obaid and Patrick Mahony were charged by Malaysia in absentia in 2020 for allegedly receiving $300 million from 1MDB through unlawful activity. In 2018, Swiss federal prosecutors opened proceedings to investigate two officials of the Saudi oil producer, without confirming their identities.AD\u2022 Ex-1MDB President Arul Kanda was charged along with Najib for allegedly tampering with a state audit report into the fund. Both men have denied wrongdoing.AD\u2022 Rosmah Mansor, Najib\u2019s wife, was charged with money laundering and tax evasion. Luxury items and cash seized from properties linked to the former first couple were valued at about 1.1 billion ringgit ($259 million). According to U.S. prosecutors, Jho Low in 2013 allegedly funneled $27.3 million that was looted from 1MDB to a New York jeweler who designed a pink diamond necklace for her.6. What\u2019s still brewing?The U.S. investigation, and whether it will force Goldman to take a guilty plea, is one of the biggest issues remaining. Prosecutors assert that beyond Leissner, some employees at Goldman knew about a bribery scheme but worked to hide it from the firm\u2019s compliance and legal departments. Singapore was said to have expanded a criminal probe to include Goldman; two Abu Dhabi funds have filed a civil suit against Goldman in New York seeking damages for alleged fraud in connection with embezzlement at 1MDB; and a Justice Department employee has pleaded guilty to funneling money into the U.S. to pay for a lobbying effort to influence the 1MDB probe, with the filing identifying the fund\u2019s source as Jho Low. In another twist, the U.S. was said to be investigating Deutsche Bank AG over a former Goldman executive who joined the German bank.ADAD7. Exactly how much money is involved?In all, 1MDB raised more than $8 billion in bond sales and accumulated billions more in debt through loans and interest payments. Swiss investigators say about $7 billion of 1MDB funds passed into the global financial system from 2009 to 2015. They\u2019re still assessing how much was misappropriated; the U.S. estimates more than half. Some 1MDB projects are going ahead under the new government, including the plan for a new financial district and a $34 billion property and transport hub. As for 1MDB, it has been reduced to a shell after the finance ministry took over its assets and debt.8. Why does it matter?Authorities in Asia, the U.S. and Europe have been working to coordinate their investigations into the money trail from 1MDB, as well as legal approaches toward Goldman and asset recovery. Their findings could potentially identify, and help close, loopholes in the global financial system that open the way for corruption.ADAD9. Who else is involved?\u2022 The Fed banned ex-Goldman banker Andrea Vella from the financial industry for life, saying the former co-head of investment banking in Asia engaged in \u201cunsafe and unsound practices\u201d by failing to ensure all of Goldman\u2019s internal committees were aware that the 1MDB bond deals involved Jho Low.\u2022 Switzerland\u2019s Office of the Attorney-General continues to investigate six people on suspicion of criminal mismanagement, bribery and money laundering related to the case. The top Swiss prosecutors have also opened criminal proceedings against two Swiss banks, Falcon Private Bank Ltd. and BSI SA, for \u201corganizational deficiencies that may have permitted the commission of offenses currently being investigated.\u201d\u2022 Zurich-based Falcon, linked to $3.8 billion of 1MDB fund flows, was ordered to cease operations in Singapore, and Switzerland has threatened to withdraw its license if there were any further breaches of money-laundering regulations.\u2022 Switzerland\u2019s financial regulator said it would review JPMorgan Chase & Co.\u2019s anti-money laundering controls after finding the bank seriously breached regulations in its dealings with 1MDB.\u2022 BSI lost its license to do business in Singapore for breaches of money laundering rules.\u2022 Malaysia central bank governor Muhammad Ibrahim resigned in 2018 amid questions over the role the monetary authority played in a land-purchase deal linked to 1MDB.

Instead, it has spurred investigations around the world into deal-making, election spending and political patronage under former Prime Minister Najib Razak. The figures are mind-boggling: Of the $8 billion that 1MDB raised via bond sales, the U.S. alleges more than half was siphoned off. Angry voters ousted Najib in a 2018 election that ended his party\u2019s 61 years of rule, and a series of trials is underway. U.S. prosecutors have implicated at least three senior bankers from Goldman Sachs Group Inc., one of whom admitted to bribery. Malaysia, which had filed its own charges, reached a $3.9 billion settlement with the bank.Support our journalism. Subscribe today.arrow-right1. What is 1MDB?ADADIt\u2019s a government investment company -- full name, 1Malaysia Development Bhd -- that took shape in 2009 under Najib, who led its advisory board. Its early initiatives included buying privately owned power plants and planning a new financial district in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia\u2019s capital. The fund proved better at borrowing -- it accumulated $12 billion in debt -- than at luring large-scale foreign investment.2. What\u2019s the issue?Much of the money raised was allegedly embezzled. The U.S. Justice Department says more than $4.5 billion flowed from the fund through fraudulent shell companies to corrupt officials and their associates. According to the U.S. indictment, a small coterie of Malaysians, led by businessman Low Taek Jho (known as Jho Low), diverted money from 1MDB into personal accounts disguised to look like legitimate businesses, and kicked back some of those funds to officials. There were questions about a $681 million payment that landed in Najib\u2019s personal bank account. Malaysia\u2019s then-attorney general cleared Najib of wrongdoing in 2016. But after losing office, Najib was charged with 42 counts of corruption, breach of trust and money laundering. He has pleaded not guilty and said most of the $681 million was returned. That and other proceedings are ongoing. Jho Low, a fugitive, has also denied any wrongdoing.ADAD3. Where\u2019s the money?Scattered, but slowly coming in. Under the July 24 settlement, Malaysia will drop all criminal charges against Goldman in exchange for a $2.5 billion cash payment and at least $1.4 billion from seized 1MDB assets being returned with the help of U.S. prosecutors and Goldman. (Goldman made $593 million working on three bond sales that raised $6.5 billion for 1MDB in 2012 and 2013 -- far more than what banks typically make from such deals.) An agreement to settle the U.S. charges with a possible $2 billion penalty was said to be awaiting a Justice Department decision on whether Goldman would have to accept its first-ever guilty plea. In addition:\u2022 U.S. prosecutors struck a deal in October with Jho Low to recoup almost $700 million worth of assets, including a Beverly Hills hotel and real estate in New York and London. That\u2019s in addition to $260 million of assets, including a $126 million super yacht, seized earlier on Malaysia\u2019s behalf.ADAD\u2022 The U.S. reached a $60 million settlement with the producers of \u201cThe Wolf of Wall Street,\u201d a 2013 movie allegedly funded with siphoned money. The production company was co-founded by Riza Aziz, Najib\u2019s stepson and a friend of Jho Low.\u2022 Malaysia is moving to seize $340 million in PetroSaudi International\u2019s accounts in London.\u2022 Singapore is returning S$35 million ($25 million) forfeited by former Goldman banker Roger Ng.4. Who\u2019s investigating?The U.S. Justice Department has been at the forefront of 1MDB investigations, focusing on bribery, theft and money laundering. According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, some potential witnesses were scared to talk because they feared retaliation. Several other countries also conducted probes. Singapore and Switzerland have fined some banks for lapses in anti-money laundering controls. Malaysia also has said it is looking into allegations that China offered to help fend off probes into 1MDB in the U.S. and elsewhere in exchange for stakes in infrastructure projects in Malaysia. A former Najib aide testified that the ex-premier offered projects to China in return for help resolving 1MDB\u2019s debt.ADAD5. Who else is charged?\u2022 Jho Low, a bon vivant who said he did consulting work for 1MDB, is portrayed by U.S. prosecutors as the central figure who set up shell companies to collect proceeds from the fund and arranged withdrawals for payoffs and for his own lavish spending. He has been charged in absentia in Malaysia and the U.S. with money laundering and other offenses. Malaysian police have bemoaned the lack of help from other jurisdictions in finding him, after saying they had located him and were in talks with a party they suspect of protecting him. Jho Low\u2019s settlement with the U.S. didn\u2019t include an admission of guilt or release him from criminal charges.\u2022 Goldman\u2019s former Southeast Asia Chairman Tim Leissner pleaded guilty to U.S. charges including conspiracy to launder money and admitted to bribing officials in Malaysia and the United Arab Emirates to get bond deals for Goldman. He agreed to forfeit $43.7 million and was scheduled to be sentenced on Jan. 22, 2021.ADAD\u2022 Ng was extradited from Malaysia to the U.S. to face similar charges. His trial start date was postponed until January 2021 by the coronavirus outbreak. (The U.S. Federal Reserve has banned both men from the financial industry.)\u2022 Malaysia leveled charges of securities law violations against Leissner, Ng, Jho Low and 1MDB\u2019s former general counsel, Jasmine Loo Ai Swan.\u2022 PetroSaudi International directors Tarek Obaid and Patrick Mahony were charged by Malaysia in absentia in 2020 for allegedly receiving $300 million from 1MDB through unlawful activity. In 2018, Swiss federal prosecutors opened proceedings to investigate two officials of the Saudi oil producer, without confirming their identities.AD\u2022 Ex-1MDB President Arul Kanda was charged along with Najib for allegedly tampering with a state audit report into the fund. Both men have denied wrongdoing.AD\u2022 Rosmah Mansor, Najib\u2019s wife, was charged with money laundering and tax evasion. Luxury items and cash seized from properties linked to the former first couple were valued at about 1.1 billion ringgit ($259 million). According to U.S. prosecutors, Jho Low in 2013 allegedly funneled $27.3 million that was looted from 1MDB to a New York jeweler who designed a pink diamond necklace for her.6. What\u2019s still brewing?The U.S. investigation, and whether it will force Goldman to take a guilty plea, is one of the biggest issues remaining. Prosecutors assert that beyond Leissner, some employees at Goldman knew about a bribery scheme but worked to hide it from the firm\u2019s compliance and legal departments. Singapore was said to have expanded a criminal probe to include Goldman; two Abu Dhabi funds have filed a civil suit against Goldman in New York seeking damages for alleged fraud in connection with embezzlement at 1MDB; and a Justice Department employee has pleaded guilty to funneling money into the U.S. to pay for a lobbying effort to influence the 1MDB probe, with the filing identifying the fund\u2019s source as Jho Low. In another twist, the U.S. was said to be investigating Deutsche Bank AG over a former Goldman executive who joined the German bank.ADAD7. Exactly how much money is involved?In all, 1MDB raised more than $8 billion in bond sales and accumulated billions more in debt through loans and interest payments. Swiss investigators say about $7 billion of 1MDB funds passed into the global financial system from 2009 to 2015. They\u2019re still assessing how much was misappropriated; the U.S. estimates more than half. Some 1MDB projects are going ahead under the new government, including the plan for a new financial district and a $34 billion property and transport hub. As for 1MDB, it has been reduced to a shell after the finance ministry took over its assets and debt.8. Why does it matter?Authorities in Asia, the U.S. and Europe have been working to coordinate their investigations into the money trail from 1MDB, as well as legal approaches toward Goldman and asset recovery. Their findings could potentially identify, and help close, loopholes in the global financial system that open the way for corruption.ADAD9. Who else is involved?\u2022 The Fed banned ex-Goldman banker Andrea Vella from the financial industry for life, saying the former co-head of investment banking in Asia engaged in \u201cunsafe and unsound practices\u201d by failing to ensure all of Goldman\u2019s internal committees were aware that the 1MDB bond deals involved Jho Low.\u2022 Switzerland\u2019s Office of the Attorney-General continues to investigate six people on suspicion of criminal mismanagement, bribery and money laundering related to the case. The top Swiss prosecutors have also opened criminal proceedings against two Swiss banks, Falcon Private Bank Ltd. and BSI SA, for \u201corganizational deficiencies that may have permitted the commission of offenses currently being investigated.\u201d\u2022 Zurich-based Falcon, linked to $3.8 billion of 1MDB fund flows, was ordered to cease operations in Singapore, and Switzerland has threatened to withdraw its license if there were any further breaches of money-laundering regulations.\u2022 Switzerland\u2019s financial regulator said it would review JPMorgan Chase & Co.\u2019s anti-money laundering controls after finding the bank seriously breached regulations in its dealings with 1MDB.\u2022 BSI lost its license to do business in Singapore for breaches of money laundering rules.\u2022 Malaysia central bank governor Muhammad Ibrahim resigned in 2018 amid questions over the role the monetary authority played in a land-purchase deal linked to 1MDB. The monetary authority set up a review of the deal.\u2022 UBS Group, DBS Group, Credit Suisse, United Overseas Bank and Standard Chartered are among those that have drawn penalties from the Singapore central bank for anti-money laundering lapses.

Subscribe today.arrow-rightChoppy diplomacy and competing territorial claims have long been a feature of the South China Sea, an area of around 1.4 million square miles stretching from Taiwan to Borneo. But the big difference in the U.S. statement is less in substance than rhetoric \u2014 and here\u2019s why that matters to the South China Sea dispute.The U.S. just dialed up the rhetoric even moreVarious news outlets described Pompeo\u2019s statement as \u201ca direct challenge,\u201d \u201cpick[ing] a fight\u201d and an \u201can official policy shift to clamp down on Beijing\u2019s activity.\u201d But did U.S. policy actually change? As several analysts have pointed out, Pompeo officially and explicitly labeled certain specific Chinese claims as illegal.ADADThat\u2019s not particularly earth-shattering \u2014 prior U.S. positions already logically implied such a stance, even if it had not previously been explicitly specified in detail. U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs David Stilwell called this announcement a matter of \u201chousekeeping.\u201d Importantly, the United States still did not take sides with any party in the various sovereignty disputes over land features (i.e., those above water at high tide) in the South China Sea.But Pompeo\u2019s statement does further ramp up the rhetoric against the backdrop of an escalating U.S.-China rift. The intense language in the statement is a sharp change from Obama-era statements. The statement accused China of \u201cbullying,\u201d seeking to \u201creplace international law with \u2018might makes right,\u2019\u201d and of having a \u201cpredatory world view.\u201d Pompeo hailed global opposition to attempts by \u201cBeijing to treat the South China Sea as its maritime empire.\u201d In subsequent remarks, Stilwell states \u201cBeijing wants dominion for itself. \u2026. Beijing threatens the existing order that has given Asia decades of prosperity.\u201dRhetoric can up the stakes and emotional salience of a dispute Disagreeing over maritime rights or legal interpretations and advocating peaceful resolution is one thing \u2014 portraying oneself as standing up to a predatory \u201cbully\u201d in defense of the international order is another matter entirely. The points of dispute may be the same, but the salience and stakes involved are not.Does the global pandemic open new South China Sea opportunities for Beijing? Not really.Crucially, the U.S. rhetoric of the past week seems to even further recast concrete disagreements over specific South China Sea disputes into grander, more abstract and more emotionally laden intangible stakes. At question, it seems, are the rules-based international order, fair play and whether to let bullies take whatever they want. The latter, in particular, is a moral framing that invites indignation and outrage.ADADWhat\u2019s the potential fallout, then? Scholars of territorial conflicts have found that intangible stakes such as symbolic value and reputational concerns are more likely to render disputes intractable. Scholars of international rivalries have also argued increasing intangible stakes make relations more conflicted. International relations scholar John Vasquez, for instance, notes, \u201cThe more tangible an issue, the greater the likelihood of eventual resolution, while the more intangible, the more contentious and conflict prone.\u201dMy research explores how ballooning symbolic stakes and emotional concerns within a dispute can fuel tensions between countries. Steps in this direction can inflate a dispute\u2019s significance, give impetus to escalating competition and inflame domestic opinion. Additionally, I have found that inciting outrage can push leaders to act in a more aggressive manner \u2014 as well as bolster domestic pressures for action.Here\u2019s what this means. Rhetoric is not simply bluster when it infuses a dispute with greater emotional salience and intangible value. This can raise the perceived stakes in a dispute with very real consequences.Seeking confrontation or seeking solutions?Granted, at present the South China Sea isn\u2019t the only set of issues in an increasingly tense bilateral relationship. Without doubt, there is much that is extraordinarily concerning in Beijing\u2019s recent actions toward Hong Kong and Xinjiang, among others. But those issues \u2014 and the responses for addressing them \u2014 are of a very different nature than the disputes between Washington and Beijing in the South China Sea. As the United States rhetorically lumps the South China Sea disputes into a general category involving \u201cBeijing\u2019s abuses\u201d and challenges to the international rule-based order, the harder it may become to find a practical path to manage differences in the South China Sea, and avoid sliding further toward all-out confrontation.ADADIn reality, the rules-based order is not perfectly clear-cut, and Beijing is not alone in not sharing Washington\u2019s interpretations of international law as it applies to the seas. The United States finds quarrel with upward of two dozen countries it sees as restricting the freedom of navigation, including Malaysia and India \u2014 and does not recognize elements of maritime boundary claims made by Japan, Vietnam and Thailand. And as Beijing does not tire of pointing out, the United States itself has yet to ratify the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). Although to be fair, the United States has long adhered to the bulk of UNCLOS provisions, treating them as customary international law.Why does China care so much about the South China Sea? Here are 5 reasons.Nothing here justifies Beijing\u2019s behavior and military buildup in the South China Sea, but the complexities of the situation suggest a more nuanced approach might be warranted. Upping the ante rhetorically, as Pompeo\u2019s statement appears to do, risks turning the South China Sea into the site of a showdown over the future of the world order.Beijing has responded with strident rhetoric of its own. Foreign Minister Wang Yi accused the United States of having \u201clost its mind, morals and credibility.\u201d The escalating rhetoric would appear to move all sides further away from finding offramps toward a mutually tolerable solution in the South China Sea \u2014 even if it means agreeing to continue disagreeing in principle.ADADIdeally, as scholar Lyle Goldstein has argued, the U.S. goal could initiate \u201ccooperation spirals \u2026 a gradual and reciprocal process of de-escalation.\u201d While that is looking ever more challenging, a good start might be reining in the rhetoric.The TMC newsletter has moved!

At a news conference, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin hinted at retaliation, saying that \u201cin response to the U.S.\u2019s unreasonable actions, China must make a necessary response and safeguard its legitimate rights.\u201d He described the U.S. allegations of espionage as \u201cmalicious slander.\u201d On Friday, China retaliated, ordering the U.S. to close its consulate in the city of Chengdu.ADADThe Trump administration only further upped the ante. On Thursday, in what was billed as a \u201cmajor\u201d foreign policy speech, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo spoke of the dangers of \u201cCommunist China\u201d to the future of the \u201cfree world.\u201d He branded Chinese President Xi Jinping a \u201ctrue believer in a bankrupt totalitarian ideology\u201d in pursuit of global Marxist \u201chegemony.\u201d Pompeo scolded those within the United States and elsewhere in the West who had chosen the path of \u201ctimidity\u201d and acquiescence to China\u2019s perceived manipulation of the global system and plans for further domination.Speaking in California at the Richard Nixon Presidential Library and Museum \u2014 named after the president who first opened U.S. relations with the People\u2019s Republic \u2014 Pompeo conjured a world shaped by an ideological war dividing the West and China. He declared that \u201cif we want to have a free 21st century,\u201d then \u201cthe old paradigm of blind engagement with China\u201d could no longer continue, a reiteration of the administration\u2019s view that its predecessors were too soft in their approach to Beijing.But the United States\u2019 top diplomat stopped short of outright calling for regime change. He said the Communist Party \u201cfears the Chinese people\u2019s honest opinions more than any foreign foe\u201d and that it was incumbent on the West to better \u201cengage and empower the Chinese people.\u201dPompeo\u2019s critics in the United States are familiar with the script \u2014 a sort of belligerent posturing that has included the Trump administration\u2019s \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d campaigns against the regimes in Iran and Venezuela. But Pompeo, who conducted a quick trip this week to Europe, where he met a leading Hong Kong dissident in London, is seeking to harness growing global consternation with Beijing and echoed calls from some hawkish corners for a newfangled \u201calliance of democracies\u201d to better counter China.ADADThis comes at a time when China is asserting itself in bolder and more provocative ways than before, from draconian crackdowns at home to recent expansionist maneuvers in the seas to its east and along its mountainous border with India. Inside China, some nationalist commentators are openly discussing the idea of an invasion of Taiwan, even as the United States expands arms sales to the island democracy that Beijing views as its own.While the Trump administration has essentially abdicated a position of global leadership during the coronavirus pandemic, China\u2019s authoritarian rulers have hardly boosted their own image. \u201cIf there is a silver lining to the current crisis maelstrom, it may be that Beijing has pulled back its own curtain, giving the world an unsolicited preview of unconstrained Chinese might,\u201d Kurt Campbell and Mira Rapp-Hooper wrote in Foreign Affairs. \u201cBy leaving a power vacuum in the world\u2019s darkest hour, the United States has bequeathed China ample room to overreach \u2014 and to demonstrate that it is unqualified for a position of sole global leadership.\u201d\u201cBy choosing unprovoked aggression over enlightened generosity, China has squandered that historic opportunity and possibly also revealed its true character,\u201d wrote Arvind Subramanian, a former chief economic adviser to the Indian government. \u201cSoft power, China appears to believe, is for wimpy democracies.\u201dBut either Trump or his Democratic opponent Joe Biden \u2014 should the latter emerge victorious in November \u2014 will have to take stock of the risks of the current path of escalation. \u201cClosing the consulate does not appear to be part of a coherent strategy to deter or compel China to alter its behavior,\u201d Jessica Chen Weiss, an expert on Chinese foreign relations, told my colleagues. \u201cIt looks more like a \u2018shock and awe\u2019 strategy to distract U.S. voters from the Trump administration\u2019s disastrous response to the pandemic.\u201dADADKurt Tong, a former U.S. consul general in Hong Kong, argued during a webinar this week that the United States needs to pursue \u201cconcerted diplomacy,\u201d rather than rhetorical broadsides, to remind China of its own overreach and miscalculations. He waved away Pompeo\u2019s insistence on plunging the world into a grand ideological struggle. \u201cChina is an authoritarian state,\u201d said Tong, but \u201cthe U.S. isn\u2019t going to succumb to authoritarianism because China is abusing its own population.\u201d\u201cBoth sides should practice some ideological humility,\u201d wrote Jie Dalei, a professor of international studies at Peking University, as part of a compilation of U.S. and Chinese academic voices on the current state of affairs. \u201cOne does not have to change [or] become the other to be able to coexist.

Consulate officials directed the researchers what information to collect, the official said.ADADThe official  noted that the FBI had arrested a network of Chinese who concealed their affiliation with the People\u2019s Liberation Army in applying for visas to conduct research in the United States. One of those arrested was holed up in the Chinese consulate in San Francisco until Thursday night and has a court appearance on Friday, the official said.Chinese consulates also are bases of operations for \u201cFox Hunt\u201d teams of agents sent from China to coerce economic fugitives or political rivals of President Xi Jinping to return to China, according to the official.Beijing has been implicated in the vast majority of counterintelligence investigations by U.S. law enforcement authorities.ADThe FBI has seen a 1,300 percent increase in cases of economic espionage related to China over the last decade, said a U.S. intelligence official. About 60 percent of the cases prosecuted involve China, the Justice official said. A senior intelligence official, also speaking on the condition of anonymity, said about 80 percent of the 2,000 active intelligence probes are tied to China. A new investigation into China\u2019s activities is opened every 10 hours on average, the official said.AD\u201cThe decision to close the consulate in Houston reflects our long-standing concerns, but also patient U.S. diplomacy,\u201d said a senior State Department official, who also spoke on the condition of anonymity. \u201cWe\u2019re positive, optimistic people. But there comes a time when you have to say, enough is enough.Some analysts thought that China would respond to the shutdown of its post in Houston by closing the U.S. Consulate in Wuhan, which has been empty since the novel coronavirus outbreak spread across the city in January and appears unlikely to reopen soon.ADInstead, Beijing took aim at the post in Chengdu, a southwestern city staffed by about 15 American diplomats that hosts political, economic and agricultural departments and the Chengdu American Center, and issues visas.The consul general in Chengdu is Jim Mullinax, a diplomat who has spent most of his career in Asia, serving in Indonesia, the Philippines, Indonesia, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Shanghai.ADMore than 13 million people were watching state broadcaster CCTV\u2019s live stream from outside the Chengdu mission at lunchtime Friday. Photos posted on Chinese social media showed a heavy police presence around the compound on Consulate Road, and crowds of people gathering to see what was happening.In announcing the mission\u2019s closure, China\u2019s Foreign Ministry in a statement blamed the Trump administration for bringing diplomacy into the countries\u2019 wider rivalry and described Beijing\u2019s response as legitimate and necessary.AD\u201cThe current situation between China and the United States is something China does not want to see, and the responsibility rests entirely with the United States,\u201d the ministry continued. \u201cWe once again urge the U.S. to immediately revoke the erroneous decision to create necessary conditions for the return of bilateral relations to normal.\u201dADThe closure will make it more difficult for U.S. officials to engage with ordinary Chinese citizens, which the State Department takes care to differentiate from the issues it has with the government. But U.S. officials said that was not a reason to stay silent.\u201cThis is about making things right,\u201d the senior State Department official said. \u201cForty years of broken glass needs be swept up and put back in order. And given the national security strategy of finally acknowledging that this really is a strategic competition, we\u2019re going to do that.\u201dThe U.S. Embassy in Beijing did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but later Friday it reissued travel guidance to Americans in China, warning them of arbitrary enforcement of local laws \u201cfor purposes other than maintaining law and order,\u201d potentially involving detention and the use of exit bans.The consulate\u2019s geographic area of responsibility covers Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou provinces, as well as Chongqing city and the Tibet Autonomous Region.ADADAs it looks for new ways to confront China, the Trump administration has taken aim at Beijing\u2019s restrictions on Tibet, which the Communist Party keeps under tight control. The administration this month said it was limiting visas for an unspecified number of Chinese officials because Beijing obstructs access to Tibet by American diplomats and other officials, journalists and tourists. Only once has the U.S. ambassador to China  been granted permission to travel to Tibet and view the situation firsthand, said the State Department official.Asked why Chengdu was chosen, Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said Friday that some of the personnel there had \u201cinterfered in China\u2019s internal affairs and harmed China\u2019s national security interests,\u201d an apparent reference to American officials\u2019 interest in Tibet.\n\n\n\n\n\nMorello and Nakashima reported from Washington.

If the free world doesn\u2019t change Communist China, Communist China will change us.\u201dPompeo\u2019s remarks at the Nixon Presidential Library and Museum in Yorba Linda, Calif., came nearly half a century after President Richard M. Nixon pursued an opening of diplomatic relations with Beijing, and were intended to delineate a sharp break in decades of U.S. policy that Trump aides have described as too lenient.The speech followed addresses from other top Trump aides \u2014 national security adviser Robert C. O\u2019Brien, Attorney General William P. Barr and FBI Director Christopher A. Wray \u2014 who delivered their own indictments of China this month in a coordinated effort to emphasize the administration\u2019s determination to confront Beijing on a wide array of issues.ADADYet the timing of the tougher strategy, coming less than four months before the presidential election, has alarmed Trump\u2019s critics. They questioned whether the president\u2019s eagerness to blame China for the pandemic \u2014 and paint Democratic rival Joe Biden as weak on Beijing \u2014 has led the administration to lash out without thinking through the consequences, an approach one Capitol Hill aide privately termed the \u201cburn it all down phase\u201d of its China policy.\u201cI am deeply concerned that the administration\u2019s approach is one that labors under the mistaken belief that just being confrontational is the same thing as being competitive,\u201d Sen. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.) told Stephen Biegun, Pompeo\u2019s top deputy, at a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing on China this week.Menendez agreed that the U.S. policy must get tougher and said he is working on a bill with fellow Democrats, but he added that \u201cbeing tough is the means, not the ends,\u201d and asked what the administration will do if Beijing follows through on threats to retaliate for the closure of the Houston consulate.ADADBiegun responded that U.S. policymakers have \u201cinvested quite a bit over the last three decades\u201d in trying to coax China into becoming a responsible international stakeholder, only to be betrayed.\u201cSometimes, wishful outcomes are hard to let go of, and many have not,\u201d he told lawmakers. \u201cThis administration has been equally criticized for moving too abruptly or too harshly or for precipitating a new Cold War, which is not our intention.\u201dInside the White House, there are signs that the emerging China strategy remains a work in progress. One White House ally said the series of speeches from Trump aides was prompted by concern among his political advisers that the president \u2014 while attacking Biden for being inconsistent on China \u2014 was himself facing criticism for having vacillated in his approach.ADAD\u201cSomebody pointed out, \u2018We look like we\u2019re flip-flopping ourselves,\u2019\u2009\u201d said this person, who is in semi-regular contact with Trump aides and spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss their private conversations. The person added that Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who has more-moderate views on China, declined a request to deliver his own address.And even as Trump has blamed China for failing to contain the virus, which originated in the city of Wuhan, he has continued to refrain from the kind of sweeping rhetoric used by some of his aides to denounce a string of Chinese offenses.During a Rose Garden news conference two weeks ago, Trump announced that he would sign an executive order to punish China for its imposition of a strict new national security law in Hong Kong. But he spent most of the hour-long event bashing Biden and touting his record in a stream-of-consciousness monologue that resembled a campaign speech.ADADAt a news conference this week, Trump suggested he remained willing to collaborate with Beijing if Chinese researchers are the first to develop an effective vaccine for the coronavirus. He was also relatively muted when asked if his administration would consider shutting down other Chinese compounds in the United States.\u201cIt\u2019s always possible,\u201d he replied.Though Trump came to office projecting a tougher edge on China, his pursuit of a bilateral trade deal \u2014 and his related unwillingness to personally criticize President Xi Jinping or forcefully confront Beijing on human rights \u2014 undercuts efforts within the administration to develop a comprehensive strategy.ADLast month, Trump\u2019s former national security adviser John Bolton asserted in a White House memoir that the president attempted to convince Xi that China\u2019s purchase of more U.S. goods would help Trump win reelection, and that the president told Xi in a private discussion that he was justified in building detention camps for \u00adUighur Muslims.ADBut trade talks have broken off amid the pandemic and Trump has not spoken with Xi since March, providing an opening for China hard-liners within the administration.In Grand Rapids, Mich., last week, Barr inveighed against Chinese surveillance and censorship, and faulted Google, Apple, Microsoft and Yahoo for collaborating with the Communist Party and becoming \u201cpawns of Chinese influence.\u201d Pompeo, who has lobbied U.S. allies to follow the administration\u2019s efforts to ban Chinese 5G telecom giant Huawei, has floated potentially banning Chinese-owned technology apps, including the popular TikTok, a social media platform.ADThe State Department issued a statement this month aligning the United States with an international tribunal\u2019s ruling four years ago that China\u2019s encroachment on disputed shipping lanes in the South China Sea was \u201cunlawful.\u201dADIn his remarks at the Nixon Library, attended by a handful of Chinese political dissidents, Pompeo accused Xi of being \u201ca true believer in a bankrupt totalitarian ideology\u201d that \u201cinforms his decades-long desire for global hegemony built on Chinese communism.\u201dMichael Pillsbury, a China analyst at the conservative Hudson Institute, said Trump, despite his long-standing concerns about China\u2019s unfair trade and intellectual property theft, had not fully endorsed an expansive indictment of the Chinese political system.AD\u201cThis is a new area for the president,\u201d said Pillsbury, who lauded the administration\u2019s \u201cdramatic reappraisal\u201d of the bilateral relationship in an op-ed Thursday.But Trump\u2019s critics faulted the administration for failing to promote an alternative U.S. leadership model abroad. During the Senate committee hearing this week, Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) said Trump\u2019s declared \u201cAmerica first\u201d policy had left all nations free to \u201cpursue their own interests\u201d rather than develop a coordinated response to Chinese aggression.ADAnd Sen. Tom Udall (D-N.M.) cited the administration\u2019s use of federal agents to employ tear gas and make arrests amid protests in Portland, Ore., and asked Biegun whether the United States was \u201cfacing more accusations of hypocrisy\u201d in criticizing China over its actions in Hong Kong.Biegun allowed that the United States is going through an \u201cuncomfortable moment,\u201d but he rejected the comparison and said the administration\u2019s effort to maintain order \u201cdoes not indict our democracy.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of this article misidentified the affiliation of Michael Pillsbury.

The U.S. continues to support Taiwan militarily, and the Clinton administration sent an aircraft carrier through the Taiwan Strait in 1996 after China fired missiles toward the island.In 2001, a Chinese fighter jet and a U.S. Navy surveillance plane collided over the South China Sea, a vital shipping lane in the Asia-Pacific region. China detained the U.S. crew for days after its plane made an emergency landing at a Chinese base.ADADAs China has grown into the world\u2019s second-largest economy, behind only the U.S., it is increasingly viewed as a competitor, both economically and militarily, and a potential challenger to the Western-led democratic model that has dominated the post-World War II era.Election-year politics in the U.S. are fanning the flames, as President Donald Trump appears to be using friction with China to drum up support among his base. Whether or not he is reelected in November, underlying differences will remain.\u201cWe are looking at a structural change in the relationship, which will continue even if Trump does not get a second term,\u201d said Steve Tsang, director of the China Institute at London\u2019s School of Oriental and African Studies.ADMilitarily, American and Chinese warships often jockey for position in the South China Sea.

This has come as his polling numbers decline over COVID-19 and he looks to paint his presumed challenger in November\u2019s election, former Vice President Joe Biden, as soft on China.ADADIn his speech Pompeo called on nations to induce change in the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s behavior \u201cbecause Beijing\u2019s actions threaten our people and our prosperity.\u201dChina has roundly rejected the administration\u2019s accusations and taken particular aim at Pompeo, who it has accused of fomenting anti-Chinese sentiment around the world. China maintains that it is only seeking to develop its economy and society for the benefit of its own people and the world.Pompeo heaped scorn on China\u2019s position, calling it a clear threat to the world. \u201cIf the free world doesn\u2019t change Communist China, Communist China will surely change us.

It has established a bloc of nations that vote with it at various United Nations and other international institutions, some of which the Trump administration has withdrawn from.ADThe State Department has been curtailing visas for Chinese and Communist Party officials involved in Xinjiang, Tibet and Hong Kong, and limiting the number of Chinese students and journalists allowed to come to the United States. In addition, the Commerce and Treasury departments have both announced new sanctions against China. They have warned private U.S. and foreign firms of potential penalties and reputational risk if they start or continue business with Chinese entities implicated by the U.S. in human rights abuses or clamping down on freedoms in Hong Kong.ADOn Wednesday, the administration ordered China to close its consulate in Houston, citing intellectual property theft, inappropriate actions on behalf of Chinese students and researchers and behavior inconsistent with legitimate diplomats by consular officials based in the Texas city.

The concerns have deepened during the coronavirus pandemic and are threatening to create a permanent fissure between Western and Chinese technology.ADThe vulnerability could allow DJI, the world\u2019s largest drone maker, or someone with access to its computer systems, to grab information from the microphones, cameras, contacts and even locations of hundreds of thousands of drone owners worldwide, the cybersecurity firms Grimm and Synacktiv found.\u00a0ADThe company is also able to send automatic updates to the apps without Google or the drone owner consenting or even necessarily knowing the app is being updated, researchers found. Theoretically that update function could be used to load the phones with malware that could send troves of data back to China, they said.\u00a0The feature is only present in Android apps used by consumer drone owners, not in the version used by companies and government agencies. It's also not present in the iPhone version of the app.\u00a0Yet the alarm comes as DJI is already under intense scrutiny by China hawks and some U.S. officials. The Pentagon banned the company\u2019s drones in 2017 over spying concerns and the Interior Department grounded its fleet of about 800 DJI drones in January. Lawmakers are seeking to ban them across the rest of the federal government and to root them out from state and local governments as well. DJI has said those bans are about politics, not security.The new reports don\u2019t include smoking-gun evidence against DJI.\u00a0There\u2019s no proof the app has been used to steal any information so far or to hand anything over to Beijing.\u00a0ADADA DJI spokesman told the New York Times the auto update feature is there to ensure drone hobbyists don\u2019t hack the system so they can break government rules about where they can fly drones and how high. \u201cIf a hacked version is detected, users are prompted to download the official version from our website,\u201d spokesman Brendan Schulman said.\u00a0DJI\u2019s ability to directly update the Android app may also be a workaround because of policies that block Google inside China, the Times\u2019s Paul Mozur, Julian E.

Evanina, director of the National Counterintelligence and Security Center, told the Times. \u201cAll Americans should be concerned that their images, biometrics, locational and other data stored on Chinese apps must be turned over to China\u2019s state security apparatus.\u201dThat\u2019s effectively the same argument U.S. officials made to justify a slew of harsh restrictions against Huawei, including banning it from government computer networks and next-generation 5G phone and Internet systems.

A provision from Sen. Mark R. Warner (D-Va.), which\u00a0would have required campaigns to report foreign efforts to interfere in a presidential election, was also dropped from the bill.

It\u2019s a constant iteration to stay steps ahead of adversaries,\u201d he said. \u201cWe fell behind, both in our protections against social engineering of our employees and restrictions on our internal tools.\u201dADNew evidence suggests the company was unprepared for the attack, which involved conning employees to give up access to internal Twitter systems. More than 1,000 employees had access to those systems, Reuters reports.\u00a0Meanwhile U.S. lawmakers are still seeking answers about the attack.\u00a0The company probably will brief the Senate Commerce Committee in coming weeks,\u00a0Martin Matishak and Eric Geller at Politico report.Apple\u2019s co-founder and a cryptocurrency company are suing YouTube for failing to crack down on hackers and scammers.Steve Wozniak, co-founder of Apple, filed a lawsuit with 17 other victims against YouTube for failing to take down cryptocurrency scams that used their likenesses.

Instead, it has spurred investigations around the world into deal-making, election spending and political patronage under former Prime Minister Najib Razak. The figures are mind-boggling: Of the $8 billion that 1MDB raised via bond sales, the U.S. alleges more than half was siphoned off. Angry voters ousted Najib in a 2018 election that ended his party\u2019s 61 years of rule, and a series of trials is underway. U.S. prosecutors have implicated at least three senior bankers from Goldman Sachs Group Inc., one of whom admited to bribery, and Malaysia has filed charges against the bank and some current and former employees.Support our journalism.

Its early initiatives included buying privately owned power plants and planning a new financial district in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia\u2019s capital. The fund proved better at borrowing -- it accumulated $12 billion in debt -- than at luring large-scale foreign investment.2. What\u2019s the issue?Much of the money raised was allegedly embezzled. The U.S. Justice Department says more than $4.5 billion flowed from the fund through fraudulent shell companies to corrupt officials and their associates. According to the U.S. indictment, a small coterie of Malaysians, led by businessman Low Taek Jho (known as Jho Low), diverted money from 1MDB into personal accounts disguised to look like legitimate businesses, and kicked back some of those funds to officials. There were questions about a $681 million payment that landed in Najib\u2019s personal bank account. Malaysia\u2019s then-attorney general cleared Najib of wrongdoing in 2016. But after losing office, Najib was charged with 42 counts of corruption, breach of trust and money laundering. He has pleaded not guilty and said most of the $681 million was returned. A verdict was expected July 28, while other proceedings are ongoing. Jho Low, a fugitive, has also denied any wrongdoing.ADAD3. Where\u2019s the money?Scattered. Former Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad has said Malaysia is seeking to recoup $7 billion. His then-finance minister said the country would consider dropping charges against Goldman in return for $7.5 billion in \u201creparations and compensations.\u201d (Goldman made $593 million working on three bond sales that raised $6.5 billion for 1MDB in 2012 and 2013 -- far more than what banks typically make from such deals.) Privately, Malaysian negotiators were considering settling for around $2 billion to $3 billion, with the current finance minister holding talks with Goldman representatives. Meanwhile, the bank could end up paying less than $2 billion to resolve U.S. probes. As for others:\u2022 The U.S. Justice Department struck a deal in October with Jho Low to recoup almost $700 million worth of assets, including a Beverly Hills hotel and real estate in New York and London. That\u2019s in addition to $260 million of assets, including a $126 million super yacht, seized earlier on Malaysia\u2019s behalf.ADAD\u2022 The U.S. reached a $60 million settlement with the producers of \u201cThe Wolf of Wall Street,\u201d a 2013 movie allegedly funded with siphoned money. The production company was co-founded by Riza Aziz, Najib\u2019s stepson and a friend of Jho Low.\u2022 Malaysia is moving to seize $340 million in PetroSaudi International\u2019s accounts in London.\u2022 Singapore is returning S$35 million ($25 million) forfeited by former Goldman banker Roger Ng.4. Who\u2019s investigating?The U.S. Justice Department has been at the forefront of 1MDB investigations, focusing on bribery, theft and money laundering. According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, some potential witnesses were scared to talk because they feared retaliation. Several other countries also conducted probes. Singapore and Switzerland have fined some banks for lapses in anti-money laundering controls. Malaysia also has said it is looking into allegations that China offered to help fend off probes into 1MDB in the U.S. and elsewhere in exchange for stakes in infrastructure projects in Malaysia. A former Najib aide testified that the ex-premier offered projects to China in return for help resolving 1MDB\u2019s debt.ADAD5. Who else is charged?\u2022 Jho Low, a bon vivant who said he did consulting work for 1MDB, is portrayed by U.S. prosecutors as the central figure who set up shell companies to collect proceeds from the fund and arranged withdrawals for payoffs and for his own lavish spending. He has been charged in absentia in Malaysia and the U.S. with money laundering and other offenses. Malaysian police have bemoaned the lack of help from other jurisdictions in finding him, after saying they had located him and were in talks with a party they suspect of protecting him. Jho Low\u2019s settlement with the U.S. didn\u2019t include an admission of guilt or release him from criminal charges.\u2022 Goldman\u2019s former Southeast Asia Chairman Tim Leissner pleaded guilty to U.S. charges including conspiracy to launder money and admited to bribing officials in Malaysia and the United Arab Emirates to get bond deals for Goldman. He agreed to forfeit $43.7 million and was scheduled to be sentenced on Jan. 22, 2021.ADAD\u2022 Ng was extradited from Malaysia to the U.S. to face similar charges. His trial start date was postponed until January 2021 by the coronavirus outbreak. (The U.S. Federal Reserve has banned both men from the financial industry.)\u2022 Malaysia filed criminal charges against three Goldman units, accusing the bank of misrepresenting to investors that the proceeds of the three 1MDB bond sales would be used for legitimate purposes, when the bank knew the funds would be misappropriated. It\u2019s seeking more than $3.3 billion. Goldman has blamed rogue employees for any wrongdoing, and said it would vigorously defend itself.\u2022 Malaysia also filed criminal charges against 17 current and former Goldman employees who served as directors of the three units, including the current president of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.ADAD\u2022 Malaysia leveled charges of securities law violations against Leissner, Ng, Jho Low and 1MDB\u2019s former general counsel, Jasmine Loo Ai Swan.\u2022 PetroSaudi International directors Tarek Obaid and Patrick Mahony were charged by Malaysia in absentia in 2020 for allegedly receiving $300 million from 1MDB through unlawful activity. In 2018, Swiss federal prosecutors opened proceedings to investigate two officials of the Saudi oil producer, without confirming their identities.\u2022 Ex-1MDB President Arul Kanda was charged along with Najib for allegedly tampering with a state audit report into the fund. Both men have denied wrongdoing.\u2022 Rosmah Mansor, Najib\u2019s wife, was charged with money laundering and tax evasion. Luxury items and cash seized from properties linked to the former first couple were valued at about 1.1 billion ringgit ($259 million). According to U.S. prosecutors, Jho Low in 2013 allegedly funneled $27.3 million that was looted from 1MDB to a New York jeweler who designed a pink diamond necklace for her.ADAD6. What\u2019s still brewing?The U.S. Justice Department\u2019s investigation of Goldman Sachs, and whether it will force the bank to take a guilty plea, is one of the biggest issues remaining. Prosecutors assert that beyond Leissner, some employees at Goldman knew about a bribery scheme but worked to hide it from the firm\u2019s compliance and legal departments. Singapore was said to have expanded a criminal probe to include Goldman; two Abu Dhabi funds have filed a civil suit against Goldman in New York seeking damages for alleged fraud in connection with embezzlement at 1MDB; and a Justice Department employee has pleaded guilty to funneling money into the U.S. to pay for a lobbying effort to influence the 1MDB probe, with the filing identifying the fund\u2019s source as Jho Low. In another twist, the U.S. was said to be investigating Deutsche Bank AG over a former Goldman executive who joined the German bank.7. Exactly how much money is involved?ADADIn all, 1MDB raised more than $8 billion in bond sales and accumulated billions more in debt through loans and interest payments. Swiss investigators say about $7 billion of 1MDB funds passed into the global financial system from 2009 to 2015. They\u2019re still assessing how much was misappropriated; the U.S. estimates more than half. Some 1MDB projects are going ahead under the new government, including the plan for a new financial district and a $34 billion property and transport hub. As for 1MDB, it has been reduced to a shell after the finance ministry took over its assets and debt.8. Why does it matter?Authorities in Asia, the U.S. and Europe have been working to coordinate their investigations into the money trail from 1MDB, as well as legal approaches toward Goldman and asset recovery. Their findings could potentially identify, and help close, loopholes in the global financial system that open the way for corruption.9. Who else is involved?\u2022 The Fed banned ex-Goldman banker Andrea Vella from the financial industry for life, saying the former co-head of investment banking in Asia engaged in \u201cunsafe and unsound practices\u201d by failing to ensure all of Goldman\u2019s internal committees were aware that the 1MDB bond deals involved Jho Low.\u2022 Switzerland\u2019s Office of the Attorney-General continues to investigate six people on suspicion of criminal mismanagement, bribery and money laundering related to the case. The top Swiss prosecutors have also opened criminal proceedings against two Swiss banks, Falcon Private Bank Ltd. and BSI SA, for \u201corganizational deficiencies that may have permitted the commission of offenses currently being investigated.\u201d\u2022 Zurich-based Falcon, linked to $3.8 billion of 1MDB fund flows, was ordered to cease operations in Singapore, and Switzerland has threatened to withdraw its license if there were any further breaches of money-laundering regulations.\u2022 Switzerland\u2019s financial regulator said it would review JPMorgan Chase & Co.\u2019s anti-money laundering controls after finding the bank seriously breached regulations in its dealings with 1MDB.\u2022 BSI lost its license to do business in Singapore for breaches of money laundering rules.\u2022 Malaysia central bank governor Muhammad Ibrahim resigned in 2018 amid questions over the role the monetary authority played in a land-purchase deal linked to 1MDB. The monetary authority set up a review of the deal.\u2022 UBS Group, DBS Group, Credit Suisse, United Overseas Bank and Standard Chartered are among those that have drawn penalties from the Singapore central bank for anti-money laundering lapses. They said they will strengthen controls in their businesses.\u2022 Singapore has banned at least eight financial professionals in connection with 1MDB.\u2022 Singapore authorities have interviewed Tan Boon-Kee, Deutsche Bank\u2019s former Asia Pacific head of financial institutions group, about the extent of her involvement with the 1MDB account. She hasn\u2019t been accused of wrongdoing.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P.", "comment": "0 Comments", "topic": "Energy"}, {"cover": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/2TICQSWNCUI6VEPRFCWKJWBTUA.jpghttps://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/2TICQSWNCUI6VEPRFCWKJWBTUA.jpg", "title": "Trump\u2019s  policy has no strategy \u2014 except to boost his reelection campaign", "date": "Jul 23, 2020", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/global-opinions/trumps-china-policy-has-no-strategy--except-to-boost-his-reelection-campaign/2020/07/23/9a46c32e-ccf1-11ea-b0e3-d55bda07d66a_story.html", "keyword": "China and the world order", "website": "the Washington Post", "author": "Editorial Board", "content": "THE UNITED STATES should be leading democratic nations in resisting China\u2019s tightening totalitarianism and escalating belligerence.

Subscribe today.arrow-rightThe State Department\u2019s abrupt order shutting down the Chinese Consulate in Houston this week is a case study in Mr. Trump\u2019s counterproductivity. It will inevitably lead to the permanent closure of a comparable U.S. mission in China \u2014 probably in Wuhan, where the covid-19 epidemic originated. That will reduce channels of communication and diminish U.S.\u2009understanding of China\u2019s domestic situation, while doing next to nothing to address the offensive activities of the Xi regime, from its crackdown in Hong Kong to its attempts to spy on Americans and steal U.S. technology.U.S. officials are describing the Houston consulate as a nest of espionage activities, though they have offered no evidence to back that up. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo portrayed the closure as sending a message: \u201cWe are setting out clear expectations for how the Chinese Communist Party is going to behave, and when they don\u2019t, we\u2019re going to take actions that protect the American people, protect our security, our national security, and also protect our economy and jobs.\u201dADADThat\u2019s good campaign rhetoric \u2014 but closing consulates won\u2019t accomplish those aims. Most Chinese hacking and spying is directed from China, not Houston. Many of the other measures Mr. Trump has taken, from imposing tariffs on U.S.-China trade to restricting student visas, have damaged the U.S.\u00a0economy and cost jobs without changing Chinese behavior.Mr. Trump\u2019s crusade \u2014 including racist references to the \u201cChinese virus\u201d and \u201ckung flu\u201d  \u2014 would be more plausible if it did not represent an abrupt, election-season U-turn. Until March, Mr. Trump was publicly praising Mr. Xi as a great leader, including in his response to the coronavirus. In private, Mr.\u2009Trump reportedly begged the Chinese ruler for help with his reelection campaign while approving of Mr. Xi\u2019s crackdowns in Hong Kong and on the Uighurs of Xinjiang province. In the trade deal he struck with Mr. Xi in January, Mr. Trump gave up demands for meaningful reforms in China\u2019s trade practices in pursuit of pre-election soybean purchases from Midwestern farmers.The president has since come to see greater electoral benefit in blaming Beijing for the spread of covid-19 while portraying opponent Joe Biden as a Chinese puppet. Some of the resulting flurry of measures are worthy, if long overdue: Under heavy pressure from Congress, the administration finally imposed sanctions on officials and companies involved in the Xinjiang and Hong Kong crackdowns.ADADYet this in no way represents a cogent strategy for countering Mr. Xi\u2019s ambition to spread China\u2019s model of dictatorship around the world and forcibly silence critics at home and abroad. That would require coordination with U.S. allies \u2014 such as Germany, South Korea and Japan, which Mr. Trump instead threatens with trade wars or the withdrawal of U.S.\u00a0troops. It would mean reviving the Trans-Pacific Partnership on trade. And it would require leaving open channels for diplomacy with Beijing to address issues such as North Korea\u2019s growing nuclear arsenal and global warming. Closing consulates will achieve none of that.Read more: Max Boot: No one does more to hurt America and help China than TrumpThe Post\u2019s View: What\u2019s happening in Xinjiang is genocideThe Post\u2019s View: China gutted Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy.

Subscribe today.arrow-rightWho\u2019s right? I\u2019d say China is largely to blame for the confrontation \u2014 but President Trump is entirely to blame for our self-defeating response.President Xi Jinping has amassed more power than any Chinese leader since Mao Zedong, and he is acting more recklessly than China did in the days when it had a collective leadership. Chinese troops clashed in June with Indian forces along their border in the Himalayas. China is redoubling its efforts to assert sovereignty over the South China Sea in violation of international law; its coast guard recently sank a Vietnamese fishing boat in disputed waters. China\u2019s repression of the Uighurs, a Muslim minority, is rising to the level of genocide. And China has trampled on Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy in violation of its 1984 handover agreement with Britain.ADADIn the past, when China was criticized, its response was usually muted. Not anymore. These days it practices \u201cwolf warrior\u201d diplomacy. When Australia called for an international inquiry into the origins of the novel coronavirus, China retaliated with trade sanctions and suspected cyberattacks. After Canada detained the chief financial officer of the Chinese technology company Huawei on a U.S. warrant in 2018, China imprisoned two innocent Canadians. \u201cWe treat our friends with fine wine,\u201d says China\u2019s ambassador to Sweden, \u201cbut for our enemies we have shotguns.\u201dChina\u2019s behavior is thuggish and unacceptable. But Trump has also contributed to the fraying of ties. While lavishly praising Xi \u2014 and reportedly approving of his crackdown on Uighurs \u2014 Trump has waged a trade war against China and falsely accused China of intentionally spreading the coronavirus (which he calls, with his trademark racism, \u201ckung flu\u201d). Now he is demonizing China in order to smear Joe Biden as a Manchurian candidate.Some of the steps that the administration has taken to push back on China make sense. For instance, it ended Hong Kong\u2019s preferential economic treatment, imposed sanctions on some Chinese officials for the mistreatment of Uighurs, lobbied U.S. allies to reject Huawei\u2019s 5G technology, rejected \u201cmost\u201d of Beijing\u2019s claims in the South China Sea and sent two aircraft carrier battle groups to the South China Sea.ADADBut Trump\u2019s trade war cost U.S. consumers billions of dollars and did not result in meaningful changes in Chinese trade practices. It\u2019s not clear whether Phase 1 of the trade deal, with China promising to buy more U.S. goods, will ever be fully implemented, and Trump has lost interest in a second phase, because it\u2019s more politically advantageous to fight with China.Trump will harm U.S. universities if he kicks out more Chinese students beyond the approximately 3,000 to 5,000 who have had their visas revoked because they were affiliated with universities tied to China\u2019s military. Imagine if China retaliated by barring students from the hundreds of U.S. universities that have Defense Department contracts.Already, Trump\u2019s decision to expel 60 Chinese journalists in retaliation for the expulsion of three U.S. reporters from China has backfired, leading Beijing to kick out more U.S. journalists. One of the journalists who was expelled wrote that \u201cthe American press corps in China\u201d has been \u201cgutted.\u201d That makes it harder to understand what China is doing.ADADNow Trump is weighing a travel ban on all members of the Chinese Communist Party and their families \u2014 as many as 270 million people \u2014 most of whom have no say in Xi\u2019s decision-making. This is nativism masquerading as a \u201cget tough on China\u201d approach. If Trump really wanted to hurt China, he would offer to take in the beleaguered people of Hong Kong, as Britain has already done.More broadly, Trump helps Beijing with his anti-globalist agenda. Who benefits when Trump pulls out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Iran nuclear deal? You guessed it: China. Trump is creating a power vacuum that Xi can fill. China is promoting an Asian trade agreement that excludes the United States, playing a more prominent role in the WHO and  negotiating a strategic pact with Iran that could lead to $400 billion in Chinese investment over 25 years.If we are serious about confronting China, we need to reassert U.S. global leadership and get our own house in order. We are losing the competition to China when, as on Monday, China had 22 new coronavirus cases and we had more than 62,000. China\u2019s economy has already started growing again while the U.S. economy continues to tread water.ADADEffectively competing with China abroad will require improving governance at home \u2014 and that starts with voting Trump out of office. There\u2019s a good reason many observers think Beijing wants another Trump term: No one does more to hurt America and help China than our feckless president.Watch the latest Opinions videos:Read more:Robert C.

Subscribe today.arrow-rightThe Chinese military has held a growing number of exercises that simulate an invasion of Taiwan, a self-ruled island about 80 miles off China\u2019s east coast that considers the United States its main military and diplomatic backer. The pace and scale of China\u2019s drills, as well as those of U.S. naval and air forces deployed to the region, have risen in recent months as relations between Beijing and Washington plummet on numerous fronts.Relations took another sharp turn Wednesday after the State Department said it ordered China to close its consulate in Houston.ADADDefense Secretary Mark T. Esper said this week the United States would sell more arms to Taiwan as part of a $10\u2009billion deal approved by Congress. He also said the U.S. military would reposition forces across Asia to prepare for a confrontation with China in flash points including self-ruled Taiwan, which China claims as its territory and has vowed for decades to take by force if necessary. Inside China, the government has faced growing calls from hawkish military pundits and nationalist commentators to grasp the current strategic window to seize Taiwan, an accomplishment that could rally the Chinese population and burnish leader Xi Jinping\u2019s political legacy.Taiwanese Foreign Minister Joseph Wu said Wednesday he was worried China has conducted an \u201cunprecedented\u201d number of sea and air drills around Taiwan in 2020, with the pace rising to nearly once every day since June. \u201cThe threat is on the rise,\u201d he said.Wu speculated that tensions in the Taiwan Strait \u2014 one of the most heavily militarized regions in the world \u2014 could continue to deteriorate as China grapples with a steep economic slowdown, the lingering fallout from covid-19 and devastating flooding across the Chinese heartland.ADADIn recent months, Wu said, China has tangled in quick succession with neighbors in the South China Sea, with India over border territory and with Western countries over Hong Kong, where the Chinese government passed a national security law that effectively cemented Communist Party control over the city\u2019s police and courts.\u201cA country will often use an exterior crisis to change the domestic focus,\u201d Wu told reporters Wednesday. \u201cIf we look at the contested issues around China\u2019s periphery, we see that for China, Taiwan would be an extremely convenient sacrificial lamb.\u201dAt the same time, Wu said, Taiwan should not provoke China through moves such as overly publicizing its support for Hong Kong protesters. \u201cWe need to be extremely cautious,\u201d he said. \u201cOther than having full military preparedness, we need to also be very careful to avoid letting Taiwan become an excuse for China to declare war or engage militarily.\u201dADADAlthough most analysts see a full-blown war between China and the United States as unlikely, Wu\u2019s comments added to the sense of unease in Asia, where a number of countries, most recently India, have complained about China\u2019s regional assertiveness and warned about the possibility of serious military clashes. A group of former senior Taiwanese officials said in a report this week that while they did not believe Beijing was edging toward an all-out invasion, Chinese forces could launch an operation to seize one of Taiwan\u2019s outlying islands.China, for its part, has accused the United States of stoking tensions by ramping up military activity in China\u2019s strategic backyard and building a coalition of countries in a Cold War-style effort to contain its rise. The U.S. Navy this month deployed two aircraft carriers to the South China Sea, days before Secretary of State Mike Pompeo declared China\u2019s claims in the sea \u2014 which cover about 90\u2009percent of the strategic waterway \u2014 to be \u201cunlawful.\u201dBeijing has also lashed out angrily at Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen, whom it accused of refusing to acknowledge a 1992 diplomatic formulation that accepted Taiwan and the Chinese mainland as part of \u201cone China.\u201dADADIn a major speech in January 2019, Xi offered an ultimatum to Taiwan to come to the table for unification talks or face annexation by force. But as a precondition for talks, China demanded that Tsai acknowledge the \u201cone China\u201d principle.Wu on Wednesday dismissed the likelihood of the Taiwanese administration entering a negotiation, saying it was \u201cabsolutely not going to go anywhere.\u201d\u201cIf China demands that Taiwan accept the precondition that Taiwan is part of China, then what\u2019s the point of negotiation if the conclusion is already reached?\u201d he said. \u201cTo talk about the prospects of dialogue I think is just hypothetical.\u201d\n\nChina vows to retaliate after U.S. orders closure of its consulate in Houston\nU.S. accuses China of sponsoring criminal hackers targeting coronavirus research\nAustralia suspends Hong Kong extradition treaty, invites migrants from city\n", "comment": "0 Comments", "topic": "Asia & Pacific"}, {"cover": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/SRWSU6WHSEI6VKBFQ4RAATSBKA.jpghttps://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/SRWSU6WHSEI6VKBFQ4RAATSBKA.jpg", "title": "The crisis that shocked the : America\u2019s response to the coronavirus", "date": "Jul 19, 2020", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/07/19/coronavirus-us-failure/", "keyword": "China and the world order", "website": "the Washington Post", "author": "Joel AchenbachWilliam WanKarin BrulliardChelsea Janes", "content": "Isabelle Papadimitriou, 64, a respiratory therapist in Dallas, had been treating a surge of patients as the Texas economy reopened.

Now, she wonders whether she\u2019ll ever be able to celebrate it again. In mourning, she\u2019s furious.Tulip, 40, had seen her country fail to control the novel coronavirus.

I\u2019m angry with the state of our politics. I\u2019m angry at the people who even now refuse to wear masks,\u201d she said.ADADSix months after the coronavirus appeared in America, the nation has failed spectacularly to contain it. The country\u2019s ineffective response has shocked observers around the planet.Many countries have rigorously driven infection rates nearly to zero. In the United States, coronavirus transmission is out of control. The national response is fragmented, shot through with political rancor and culture-war divisiveness. Testing shortcomings that revealed themselves in March have become acute in July, with week-long waits for results leaving the country blind to real-time virus spread and rendering contact tracing nearly irrelevant.Stay safe and informed with our free Coronavirus Updates newsletterThe United States may be heading toward a new spasm of wrenching economic shutdowns or to another massive spike in preventable deaths from covid-19 \u2014 or both.ADHow the world\u2019s richest country got into this dismal situation is a complicated tale that exposes the flaws and fissures in a nation long proud of its ability to meet cataclysmic challenges.ADThe fumbling of the virus was not a fluke: The American coronavirus fiasco has exposed the country\u2019s incoherent leadership, self-defeating political polarization, a lack of investment in public health, and persistent socioeconomic and racial inequities that have left millions of people vulnerable to disease and death.In this big, sprawling, demographically and culturally diverse nation, the decentralized political structures gave birth to patchwork policies that don\u2019t make sense when applied to a virus that ignores state boundaries and city limits.ADWhile other countries endured some of the same setbacks, few have suffered from all of them simultaneously and catastrophically. If there was a mistake to be made in this pandemic, America has made it.The single biggest miscalculation was rushing to reopen the economy while the virus was still spreading at high rates through much of the country, experts say. The only way to reopen safely, epidemiologists said as far back as early April, was to \u201ccrush the curve\u201d \u2014 to drive down the rate of viral transmission to the point that new infections were few and far between.Many countries did just that. The United States did not follow the expert advice. Now, the curve is crushing America.ADAD\u201cWe didn\u2019t have the stick-to-itiveness, the determination, to carry through what we started in March, April and May, and now the virus is taking advantage of that,\u201d National Institutes of Health Director Francis Collins said.\u201cIf we\u2019d had really strong guidance from local, state and national leaders, maybe we could have sustained the determination to get the curve all the way down to zero,\u201d he said. \u201cNow, we\u2019re on the upswing, and I don\u2019t quite see the top of the upswing yet.\u201dAmerica, the outlierOther countries have managed to avoid the kind of dramatic viral resurgence that is happening in America. Spain, Italy, Germany and France \u2014 all devastated by the virus months ago \u2014 drove coronavirus cases and deaths to relatively low levels. The United Kingdom has been an outlier in Europe, with one of the highest per capita death tolls in the world, but after suppressing transmission, it has not seen a major rebound.And in Asia, the picture is radically different. In Taiwan, baseball fans sit in the stands and watch their teams play. Japan has had fewer than 1,000 deaths from covid-19, the illness caused by the coronavirus. South Korea has had fewer than 300. Vietnam has recorded no deaths from the virus.The death rate from covid-19 in the United States looks like that of countries with vastly lower wealth, health-care resources and technological infrastructure.America\u2019s mishandling of the pandemic has defied most experts\u2019 predictions. In October, not long before the novel coronavirus began sickening people in China, a comprehensive review ranked the pandemic preparedness of 195 countries. The project \u2014 called the Global Health Security Index and spearheaded by the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security and the Nuclear Threat Initiative \u2014 assigned scores to countries as a way to warn them of the rising threat of infectious-disease outbreaks.ADADWith a score of 83.5 out of 100, the United States ranked No. 1.How did the nation get caught so flat-footed? By not really trying, said Beth Cameron, who helped lead the project for the Nuclear Threat Initiative.The federal government punted the coronavirus response to the states, counties and cities, said Cameron, who was senior director for global health security and biodefense on the White House National Security Council and helped write a pandemic response plan under President Barack Obama. The team Cameron led was disbanded after Donald Trump took office. The White House says positions on the disbanded team were absorbed into another office.AD\u201cI just never expected that we would have such a lack of federal leadership, and it\u2019s been deliberate,\u201d she said. \u201cIn a national emergency that is a pandemic, spreading between states, federal leadership is essential. And if there was any doubt about that, we ran that experiment from March and April until now. It failed. So we have to run a different experiment.\u201dA nation of individualsSomehow, this highly mobile virus keeps sneaking up on communities, seeding itself extensively before people detect the breadth and intensity of the attack. That happened catastrophically in New York City early in the pandemic. The new outbreaks have been largely in the South and West.ADADThis month, Roy Ramos, a reporter for WPLG-TV in Miami, noticed he had a cough. He and his wife, the station\u2019s evening news anchor, Nicole Perez, went to get tested for the coronavirus. Positive \u2014 both of them. Soon, another anchor and the station\u2019s chief meteorologist had tested positive, too.As of July 14, 10 station employees had tested positive, including some who hadn\u2019t even been in the office or in contact with their co-workers. The virus was everywhere in South Florida, which is now reeling from the pathogen\u2019s assault.\u201cThis is not a political message, but a personal one,\u201d Perez\u2019s co-anchor, Calvin Hughes, told viewers. \u201cPlease, please wear a mask.\u201dIn the minds of many Americans, the coronavirus crisis that was so alarming in March and April lost its fearsomeness in May and June, when people tried to resume something approximating a normal life. The shutdowns had been miserable, but they\u2019d been effective.ADADThe success of the shutdowns meant that many Americans didn\u2019t know anyone personally sickened by the virus. In places with low transmission, the crisis seemed far away.\u201cWe just let our guard down,\u201d Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine (R) said in an interview Friday. \u201cSome people when they heard, \u2018Hey, Ohio\u2019s open,\u2019 what they mentally processed is, \u2018It\u2019s safe. We can go out and do whatever we want to. It\u2019s back to normal.\u2019 \u201dIn the past two months, the virus has been smoldering in his state, the governor said, and \u201cnow we start to see some flames.\u201d He fears Ohio could soon have the kind of runaway transmission afflicting Florida.\u201cFlorida a month ago is where Ohio is today. If we don\u2019t want to be Florida, we\u2019ve got to change what we\u2019re doing. Everybody\u2019s got to mask up,\u201d the governor said.He and others cite human nature as a problem with containing the virus. Human brains simply aren\u2019t wired to emphasize the importance of doing things, like wearing masks, that protect others but offer no immediate payoff, said Paul Slovic, a University of Oregon psychologist.AD\u201cYou don\u2019t get rewarded for putting on a mask,\u201d Slovic said. \u201cYou don\u2019t see who you\u2019ve protected from harm, but you do feel an immediate discomfort.\u201dProtecting one life \u2014 or even one small puppy \u2014 generates a major emotional response that can prompt action, Slovic has found. But as the number of individuals involved increases \u2014 say, to the 137,000-plus deaths caused by the coronavirus \u2014 people grow inured to the loss, less prone to take action.That makes public messaging especially essential, experts say. But the messaging in the United States has been all over the place. Even the scientists have struggled: They were wobbly on the effectiveness of masks before eventually embracing them.Kristin Urquiza, 39, said she tried warning her father, Mark \u2014 a lifelong Republican \u2014 against going out and risking infection. In their home state of Arizona, as leaders including Gov. Doug Ducey (R) sprinted to reopen in May and June, Urquiza could tell she was losing the argument.\u201cWhen the president, the governor and people on cable news are all saying one thing, how do you compete with that?\u201d she said. \u201cHe would push back. \u2018I hear what you\u2019re saying, but why would the governor say it\u2019s safe to go out if it\u2019s not true?\u2019 \u201dADHer father died of the virus June 30. In the obituary she wrote, she lashed out at government leaders.\u201cHe was a huge supporter of Trump and Arizona governor Ducey. He believed what they said. And they betrayed him,\u201d she said in an interview.When there\u2019s no cavalry to sendEven before the pandemic hit, local public health agencies had been decimated by years of staffing and budget cuts.They had lost almost a quarter of their overall workforce since 2008 \u2014 a cut of almost 60,000 workers, according to national associations of health officials. The agencies\u2019 main source of federal funding \u2014 the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s emergency preparedness budget \u2014 had been cut 30 percent since 2003.Public health is an enterprise with an intrinsic problem: People can\u2019t see sicknesses avoided or deaths averted.\u201cYou don\u2019t see the results. It\u2019s a dog that doesn\u2019t bark,\u201d said David Himmelstein, professor of public health and health policy at the CUNY School of Public Health.\u201cThe question is, does the water come out of your tap clean? Are the sewer systems being inspected? Are restaurants and food being inspected? Those things, you don\u2019t notice until they fail,\u201d he said.The country\u2019s electronic disease surveillance systems are \u201carchaic and cumbersome,\u201d said Cathy Slemp, who was recently dismissed as West Virginia\u2019s public health commissioner after the governor blamed her for failing to reclassify certain coronavirus cases as recovered.\u201cWe\u2019re driving a Pinto and want to have a Ferrari,\u201d she said.The public health challenges are keenly felt in Malheur County, a vast swath of mostly federal rangeland in rural eastern Oregon. About a quarter of its 30,000 residents live in poverty. Teen pregnancy rates are double the statewide rate. There\u2019s one school nurse for 10,000 square miles. Drug use is high.The first coronavirus case hit March 30, and for more than a month, the county averaged just one to two cases a week. There was resistance to a statewide shutdown in the conservative area, but most people were willing to observe temporary restrictions, said Sarah Poe, director of the county health department.But after a month or so, residents began to complain of government overreach. Many felt they had to resume working to survive, she said.\u201cPeople\u2019s response has been to just take care of themselves, take care of your own business, your own family,\u201d Poe said. \u201cThat\u2019s not how this virus works.\u201dNow, the coronavirus is a full-blown crisis in Malheur County. Cases began soaring three weeks ago, to 15 or 16 a day. As of Friday, the county had 477 cases. The cumulative positive rate since the first case is nearly 16 percent \u2014 quadruple the state\u2019s rate.On Wednesday, facing an accelerating caseload, Malheur County commissioners passed a resolution that goes further than the state\u2019s mask order. It recommends gatherings of no more than 10 people indoors and 25 outdoors, and mask-wearing in groups indoors and out.But resistance in the county remains high. Poe said she regularly gets hate mail and phone calls accusing her of peddling a hoax.\u201cWe\u2019re up against just a ton of misinformation,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat are we fighting here? We are fighting a virus and our goal is to save lives. Let\u2019s not be distracted into fighting other people.\u201dA turning pointAmerica, experts say, is approaching a tipping point at which its public health systems could become so overwhelmed they begin to collapse. Already, coronavirus test results take so long to come back they are almost useless for anything except as a historical record.The delays have a cascading effect. Contact tracing is rendered ineffectual. Containing the virus by isolation becomes impossible. And as hospitals fill, the virus\u2019s fatality rate could inch upward because of overtaxed ICU nurses and doctors struggling to care for so many.But the most dangerous cascading effect could be despair \u2014 a loss of hope, along with the resolve to fight the virus, warned Michael T. Osterholm, director of the University of Minnesota\u2019s Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy.\u201cWhen that happens, you lose the ability to act rationally. You lose the commitment to fight. You lose all chance of beating back the virus,\u201d he said.Adam Fleming Petty, a writer in Grand Rapids, Mich., said he feels that demoralization acutely \u2014 as well as \u201cso much rage\u201d at Trump and other political leaders whose measures did not quell the virus enough to allow many schools to open.\u201cOne thing I told myself was, \u2018Okay, as long as school starts back up in the fall, I can do this. I can make it through the summer if I have that goal waiting for me.\u2019 Now, that goal isn\u2019t there anymore,\u201d said Petty, 38, who has been the primary supervisor of two daughters, ages 5 and 7, while his wife works from home. For four months, the family has socialized with only a handful of relatives just a few times.\u201cThis is far from the first time that governmental administrative incompetence has been displayed. But I can\u2019t remember the last time that the consequences of that were so personal,\u201d Petty said.Governors and local officials across the Sun Belt have announced incremental measures in recent days to halt the viral resurgence. California instituted a statewide mask requirement. Arkansas and Colorado did so Thursday. Arizona allowed local jurisdictions to implement mask mandates as they see fit.Florida\u2019s governor has resisted weeks of calls to implement such a mandate. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp (R) announced Wednesday that all local mask mandates in his state are void.Louisiana and Texas recently shut down bars all over again. Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey (R) announced a statewide mask mandate in recent days as an alternative to closing. West Virginia limited gatherings to 25 people or fewer.In New York, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo (D) threatened to close restaurants if social distancing is not taken seriously.\u201cClosing the bars is going to be the equivalent of fixing three of the five screen doors in your submarine,\u201d said Osterholm, who says that places with high levels of transmission need to return to the kind of shutdowns common in March and April.In a telephone interview, Cuomo said New York officials were caught off guard early in the year because everyone assumed the virus was coming into the West Coast from China. But it had already spread in Europe, and from there to New York.\u201cWe didn\u2019t find out until after the fact. You don\u2019t have the revelation by the academics until mid-March that this was one of the great health blunders of all time,\u201d Cuomo said. \u201cYou actually got hit by a bus that came from the other direction.\u201dHe expressed dismay about the national failure to suppress the virus.\u201cIf you could have written a prescription four months ago, a manual \u2014 \u2018This is what you must do to deal with a virus\u2019 \u2014 and if people could just follow the manual, we would be over this, like other countries are over it,\u201d Cuomo said. \u201cI think it exposed a fundamental weakness in this country. We have a divided country.\u201dNew York beat back the virus by closely following the scientific data and being cautious about reopening the economy, Cuomo said. Many places suffering high rates of infections didn\u2019t do that, he said.\u201cIt was science denial meets government incompetence,\u201d he said.\u2018The exception and anomaly\u2019This crisis has been sucked inexorably into the vortex of political polarization.Trump repeatedly downplayed the viral threat. \u201cYou have 15 people, and the 15 within a couple of days is going to be down to close to zero,\u201d he said in late February. On Twitter, he cheered on citizen protests of shutdowns that had been ordered by Democratic governors. He did not wear a mask in public until July 11.White House spokeswoman Sarah Matthews in a statement defended the administration\u2019s response to the crisis, saying Trump \u201chas led an historic, whole-of-America coronavirus response \u2014 resulting in 100,000 ventilators procured, sourcing critical PPE for our frontline heroes, and a robust testing regime resulting in more than double the number of tests than any other country in the world. \u2026 This strong leadership will continue as we safely reopen the economy, expedite vaccine and therapeutics developments, and continue to see an encouraging decline in the U.S. mortality rate.\u201dA White House official on background defended the president\u2019s support for reopening the economy while the virus was still spreading, citing Trump\u2019s belief that the cure cannot be worse than the disease: \u201cThere are consequences to staying closed, including but not limited to missed doctors\u2019 appointments, drug or alcohol misuse, and suicide as a result of the pandemic.\u201dFuture historians will not treat kindly Trump\u2019s efforts to divide and confuse, said James Grossman, executive director of the American Historical Association.\u201cYou look at the Great Depression and how Roosevelt made a concerted effort to unite the country \u2014 the fireside chats, the New Deal. That is the instinctive reaction of almost every president in crisis. Even if you don\u2019t succeed, you try to convince people that they\u2019re all in this together,\u201d Grossman said. \u201cThis presidency is the exception and anomaly.\u201dMany Americans now believe the pandemic has been exaggerated, or even fabricated, by scientists and the mainstream news media. The rejection of scientific expertise has flowered into a conspiracy theory holding that the experts are lying as part of a political agenda.\u201cThe most outrageous lies are the ones about Covid 19. Everyone is lying. The CDC, Media, Democrats, our Doctors, not all but most, that we are told to trust,\u201d former \u201cWheel of Fortune\u201d game show host Chuck Woolery tweeted July 12.Trump retweeted that. Days later, Woolery revealed his son was sick with the virus, and he has since taken down his Twitter account.To be an AmericanAs she prepares for a three-day drive across the country \u2014 from New York to Texas \u2014 to bury her mother, Tulip said she has been thinking a lot about what it means to be American.She was raised like many Texans, unabashedly proud of her roots and her patriotism. \u201cI grew up a Dallas Cowboys fan. All about the stars and stripes. You know that song \u2018Proud to Be an American\u2019? We would literally sing that as kids in elementary school and mean every word.\u201dNow, she said, she feels betrayed by her country and home state. For the past two weeks, she and her husband have been calling funeral homes in Brownsville, unable to get through because the town has been overwhelmed by the virus.\u201cI desperately want to believe we as a country can change, that we can recover from where we are now,\u201d she said. \u201cI want to believe that America can get back to who we were, a proud country, one where people can thrive and not suffer.\u201dIsaac Stanley-Becker contributed to this report.", "comment": "0 Comments", "topic": "Health"}, {"cover": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/QQJ7VOGFLUI6VKM7HO677MNPHA.jpghttps://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/QQJ7VOGFLUI6VKM7HO677MNPHA.jpg", "title": "California  new closures as U.S. retreat from coronavirus reopenings accelerates", "date": "Jul 13, 2020", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/california-orders-new-closures-as-us-retreat-from-coronavirus-reopenings-accelerates/2020/07/13/ae28f192-c543-11ea-8ffe-372be8d82298_story.html", "keyword": "China and the world order", "website": "the Washington Post", "author": "Griff Witte", "content": "Please NoteThe Washington Post is providing this important information about the coronavirus for free.

Gavin Newsom on Monday announced a dramatic rollback in the state\u2019s reopening plan, ordering a wide swath of businesses to end indoor operations as coronavirus case numbers continued to climb in the nation\u2019s largest state \u2014 and well beyond.Restaurants, wineries, movie theaters and museums were told to shut down their indoor operations, while bars were closed even for outdoor service. In hard-hit counties, hair salons, malls and fitness centers were also shuttered.The decision was the latest indication that America\u2019s summer surge remains in full swing, and that policymakers are being forced to retreat from promises made in May and June of a respite from coronavirus-mandated shutdowns.ADThere were ample indications Monday that the pandemic will continue to severely disrupt life in the United States for months to come.ADSchool leaders in Los Angeles, San Diego and Atlanta said their districts will begin the year online, rather than in person. Oregon\u2019s governor banned gatherings of more than 10\u00a0people inside and ordered face coverings for those who venture out. The Chicago Marathon \u2014 not planned until mid-October \u2014 was canceled for only the second time in its history.Meanwhile, Miami was declared the latest \u201cepicenter of the epidemic,\u201d and a senior medical official compared it to Wuhan at the height of China\u2019s struggles with the virus. AD\u201cThe skyrocketing infection rates of the past few weeks make it clear the pandemic is not under control,\u201d said a joint statement from Los Angeles Unified and San Diego Unified school districts, the state\u2019s two largest.Monday\u2019s data reflected the reality that other nations across the globe have managed to suppress the virus, but not the United States. In at least 12 states, the weekly average of new coronavirus cases increased by more than 40\u00a0percent, according to data tracked by The Washington Post.ADWhile states such as Florida and Arizona for weeks have been major hot spots for the U.S. outbreak, Monday\u2019s figures showed that the virus continues to spread widely beyond the hard-hit Sun Belt states.ADVirginia, West Virginia, Alaska, Missouri, Hawaii, Rhode Island and Minnesota all saw the average rate of new infections rise between 41 and 55\u00a0percent compared with the week of July\u00a06.Colorado, Kentucky, the District of Columbia, Montana, North Dakota and the Virgin Islands saw increases of average new infections at a rate of 63\u00a0percent or higher. Sparsely populated North Dakota had a particularly intense week, with the number of infections nearly doubling from 44 to 84.U.S. infectious-disease point man Anthony S. Fauci said the country had not \u201ceven begun to see the end\u201d of the coronavirus.ADIn a webinar with the Stanford School of Medicine, Fauci \u2014 who has been under assault from the White House, despite serving as the administration\u2019s top scientific adviser on the coronavirus \u2014 blamed summer outbreaks on states that had gone from shutdowns to \u201ccomplete throwing caution to the wind.\u201dADFauci last week suggested that some states may need to revert to shutdowns. But he was more cautious Monday, suggesting that they may simply need to \u201cpull back a bit.\u201dCalifornia\u2019s new orders did more than that: Its new restrictions represent some of the most far-reaching rollbacks of any state.\u201cIt\u2019s incumbent upon all of us to recognize soberly that covid-19 is not going away any time soon until there is a vaccine and/or an effective therapy,\u201d Newsom (D) said at a news conference.Among the troubling trends the governor highlighted: a seven-day average of new cases  topping 8,000, an increasing number of virus hospitalizations and the attendant rise in patients seeking help at intensive care units. The list of counties with additional targeted closures \u2014 which already includes more than half of the state\u2019s 58 \u2014 is expected to grow longer in the coming days, Newsom said.ADADTo the north, Oregon Gov. Kate Brown (D) banned indoor gatherings of more than 10\u00a0people and required face coverings outside. The fresh round of restrictions echoes the pandemic\u2019s early days, when states shuttered businesses in an attempt to slow the spread.California trails only Florida and Texas for the most new infections reported each day, according to the data compiled and analyzed by The Post. Governors in those two states, both Republicans, have refused to go as far as Newsom or Brown did in seeking to suppress the current surge.Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis closed bars late last month, but has defied calls for a broader retrenchment from the rapid reopening he oversaw starting in early May.ADFlorida on Sunday shattered all previous records for new daily cases among U.S. states, with 15,300. It added another 12,624 on Monday. Still, many aspects of life have continued to go on \u2014 including the reopening of Disney World over the weekend. The state is due to host the Republican National Convention next month.ADBut health experts say the situation is increasingly untenable, particularly in the urban core at the state\u2019s southeastern tip.\u201cMiami is now the epicenter of the pandemic,\u201d said Lilian Abbo, an infectious-disease specialist from the University of Miami Health System. \u201cWhat we were seeing in Wuhan six months ago, now we\u2019re there.\u201dADMiami Mayor Francis Suarez (R) told \u201cGood Morning America\u201d that \u201cthere is no doubt that our death rate is going to go up after the next week or two.\u201dThe sobering assessment came as drugmakers continued to race toward the development of a vaccine that could help to halt the spread of a virus that has led to at least 3.3\u00a0million cases and more than 132,000 deaths in the United States.The Food and Drug Administration on Monday granted \u201cfast-track\u201d status to two covid-19 vaccine candidates developed by American drugmaker Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech. The move raises the possibility that a successful vaccine could be put into production by year\u2019s end or early 2021, the companies announced Monday.ADADAlso hopeful was news out of New York, where Mayor Bill de Blasio (D) celebrated the city\u2019s first day in months without a coronavirus death. But the mayor, who has overseen a cautious reopening, also preached continued vigilance. \u201cIt\u2019s something that should make us hopeful, but it\u2019s very hard to take a victory lap because we know we have so much more ahead,\u201d he said, noting the spikes in other states and rising infection rates among younger people in New York.\u201cEven though overall we have seen a huge reduction in the presence of the coronavirus in the city, we do see one trend that\u2019s worrisome for young adults. We see the infections rising,\u201d he said. \u201cThe particular group we\u2019re concerned about is 20-year-olds to 29-year-olds.\u201dDemocratic leaders have generally favored a more cautious approach to reopening, while Republicans have tended to push for more rapid returns to normal economic life. Face masks, too, have been divisive, with President Trump having mocked those who wear them \u2014 and refusing, until recently, to don one himself.ADSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), who favors mask use, noted pointedly on Monday that \u201csome people\u201d have politicized the issue, though he did not specify who.Among the public, Democrats are much more likely than Republicans to wear a face mask outside the home, according to a poll released by Gallup on Monday.Sixty-one percent of Democrats say they always wear a mask, compared with 24\u00a0percent of Republicans, according to the poll results. Meanwhile, 27\u00a0percent of Republicans say they never wear a mask outside the home, compared with only 1\u00a0percent of Democrats.Trump has consistently boasted about the U.S. response to the virus. But current and former members of his administration have acknowledged serious flaws and continued to do so Monday.Mick Mulvaney, the former acting White House chief of staff, wrote in an op-ed that the United States still has a \u201ctesting problem\u201d and said policymakers need to realize that the \u201ccurrent economic crisis is public-health driven.\u201dAD\u201cI know it isn\u2019t popular to talk about in some Republican circles, but we still have a testing problem in this country,\u201d Mulvaney, who left the White House in March, said in the piece published by CNBC. \u201cMy son was tested recently; we had to wait 5 to 7 days for results.\u201dAtlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms (D) said Monday that her wait for test results was even longer after her husband came down with coronavirus symptoms, and that the virus spread through her household as the family waited.\u201cIt took us eight days to get our previous testing. Certainly, had we known that we had someone in the house who was asymptomatic, we would\u2019ve taken all due precautions,\u201d the mayor, who announced last week that she had tested positive, told CNN. \u201cBut this is the issue we\u2019re having across the country. And it\u2019s the reason why we cannot get to the other side of this virus.\u201d\n\nKim Bellware, Jacqueline Dupree, Reis Thebault, Laura Meckler, Lateshia Beachum, John Wagner and Hannah Denham contributed to this report.", "comment": "156 Comments", "topic": "National"}, {"cover": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/5DOOHYGASYI6VCIINCRLT2XJ4A.jpghttps://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/5DOOHYGASYI6VCIINCRLT2XJ4A.jpg", "title": "The Health 202: The White House is prepping an executive  to shift drug production to U.S.", "date": "Jul 8, 2020", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/the-health-202/2020/07/08/the-health-202-the-white-house-is-prepping-an-executive-order-to-shift-drug-production-to-u-s/5f04ba5d88e0fa7b44f6f781/", "keyword": "China and the world order", "website": "the Washington Post", "author": "Paige Winfield Cunningham", "content": "with Paulina FiroziThe coronavirus pandemic has laid bare just how much the United States relies on Chinese manufacturers for medical supplies.\u00a0Support our journalism. Subscribe today.arrow-rightBut President Trump's plan for an executive order to shift drug and medical production to this country \u2013 by suddenly cutting off federal agencies from those offshore supply chains \u2013 could make it even harder to obtain supplies critical to combating the pandemic, such as personal protective equipment, testing supplies and even medications to treat coronavirus patients.\u00a0The order, which the administration has been working on since March, is expected to apply to government programs and agencies that directly purchase drugs and medical supplies, according to lobbyists and industry watchers. They may include the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Strategic National Stockpile and the Federal Bureau of Prisons.\u00a0The goal is to ease crippling supply chain problems that left the United States without enough tests and protective equipment.The order, led by White House trade adviser Peter Navarro, would broaden existing federal requirements for government agencies to prioritize buying supplies for medicines deemed \u201cessential\u201d from U.S. manufacturers, rather than companies in China or elsewhere around the world.\u00a0ADADAs we\u2019ve written in The Health 202, labs struggled to ramp up coronavirus testing, and hospitals and nursing homes ran short of personal protective equipment over the spring. These failures hampered the national and state responses to the pandemic, leaving the United States with far more infections and deaths than any other country. Even now, shortages of protective medical gear are looming as outbreaks grow in the South. One big reason why is because these supplies often come from other countries, which were also dealing with outbreaks.\u00a0Neither the White House nor the Department of Health and Human Services gave us details about when the order might be released or what it might contain. But HHS Secretary Alex Azar told Bloomberg Radio that the pandemic showed medical supplies are crucial for national security and suggested Trump will use executive authority to \u201cfund and incentivize domestic manufacturing\u201d for prescription drugs and personal protective equipment.\u00a0\u201cThe coronavirus pandemic brought home that core elements of our medical supply chain are just as strategic to our national security as, say, nuclear submarines and aircraft carriers are, and have to be treated with that same kind of approach,\u201d Azar said. White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows told Fox News that the executive order is among several Trump will sign this week. \u00a0But U.S. dependence on China is exactly why drugmakers and business groups aren\u2019t enthused about cutting ties during a pandemic.\u00a0The nation\u2019s pharmaceutical industry has pushed back against the potential order, arguing that the United States shouldn\u2019t shut itself off from a global supply chain.\u00a0ADAD\u201cTurning our backs on trading partners during a crisis could damage our relationships long after this pandemic ends,\u201d the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America and dozens of other business and trade groups wrote in a March letter to the administration.Other critics say that revising the government\u2019s purchasing rules won\u2019t provide a quick solution to the supply shortages of the current pandemic. \u201cMaking Buy American provisions tighter during the current crisis would likely do more harm than good,\u201d write William Reinsch and Jack Caporal of the Center for Strategic and International Studies.The U.S. relies heavily on Chinese companies for generic drugs and raw materials to make them.\u00a0Eighty percent of the nation\u2019s active pharmaceutical ingredients come from overseas \u2014 and China is its No. 2 supplier, behind only Canada.ADADWhen it comes to generic drugs, a \u201csubstantial portion\u201d of U.S. imports come either directly from China or third countries such as India, which use active ingredients sourced from China, according to a report by the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission.Moreover, U.S. dependence on China for drugs and drug products is growing. Its imports of Chinese medical equipment increased 78 percent between 2010 and 2018.The order probably would revise how a 1933 law encouraging American-made products is applied to pharmaceuticals.The Buy American Act requires federal agencies to prioritize buying products made in the United States. It works by slapping a cost penalty on bids from companies that don\u2019t meet Buy America requirements.ADBut several exemptions allow agencies to duck the requirements when it comes to buying medical supplies internationally. Under the executive order the administration is mulling, the exemptions and waivers would be pulled back for essential medicines and penalties would be broadly applied to products produced offshore.ADThe administration is still considering how to determine which medicines are essential drugs, lobbyists say. The order could direct the Department of Health and Human Services and the Defense Department to come up with a list. Or it could rely on a list of more than 400 essential medicines compiled by the World Health Organization.Ahh, oof and ouchAHH: The Trump administration has officially told the United Nations it plans to withdraw from the World Health Organization.The move could have a major impact on public health diplomacy. \u201cIt is not clear whether the president can pull the United States out of the organization and withdraw funding without Congress. When Trump first threatened to withdraw, Democratic lawmakers argued that doing so would be illegal and vowed to push back,\u201d Emily Rauhala, Karoun Demirjian and Toluse Olorunnipa report. \u201c\u2026 The decision to withdraw comes after months of criticism and threats from the U.S. president.\u201dADADThe letter sent to U.N. Secretary General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres has not yet been made public, and the United States must give a year\u2019s notice and pay any debts to the U.N. agency before an exit.\u00a0Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) criticized the decision, per C-SPAN producer Craig Caplan:House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) called the president\u2019s move \u201can act of true senselessness\u201d:\u00a0From Sen. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.):\u00a0Trump began to target the agency as coronavirus took hold in the U.S., after initially praising the WHO\u2019s handling of the crisis. He announced in April he would freeze funding to the agency amid a review of its coronavirus response.\u00a0OOF: A nursing home in Pennsylvania gave residents hydroxychloroquine, including to patients who hadn't been tested for the coronavirus.\u00a0The drug regimen worried some nurses at the Southeastern Veterans\u2019 Center in the suburbs of Philadelphia, who called the widespread and off-label use of one of the antimalarial drugs Trump touted the \u201ccovid cocktail,\u201d Debbie Cenziper and Shawn Mulcahy report.\u00a0ADADThe regimen also appeared to go against guidance from the Food and Drug Administration, which said in March that the drugs should only be used during clinical trials or in hospital settings where \u201ccareful heart monitoring\u201d is provided.\u00a0\u201cFor more than two weeks in April, a drug regimen that included hydroxychloroquine was routinely dispensed at the struggling center, often for patients who had not been tested for covid-19 and for those who suffered from medical conditions known to raise the risk of dangerous side effects, interviews, emails and medical notes and records obtained by The Washington Post show,\u201d they write.Several nursing home staff members said more than 30 residents may have received the drug. The center and the two state agencies responsible for oversight have released little information about what transpired.\u00a0ADAD\"The Department of Military and Veterans Affairs has confirmed the use of the drug but has not offered details about what led the doctors on site to decide to use it,\u201d my colleagues add. \u201cThe state Department of Health, which inspected the home on May 1 and did not cite a single deficiency in infection control or patient care, declined to say whether hydroxychloroquine was administered. The center has released no information about how patients were selected or monitored.\u201d\u00a0OUCH: Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) wouldn't explain why the state has not started reporting daily hospitalization data.The governor, who has pledged to report the data, did not respond to repeated questions about why that hasn't yet happened, the Miami Herald\u2019s Samantha Gross reports. The state is an exception among others that have regularly reported the number of currently hospitalized coronavirus patients.\u00a0\u201cMiami-Dade County Mayor Carlos Gimenez, who sat next to DeSantis at the Tuesday event, ordered hospitals in the county to report patient admissions, ICU capacity, ventilator inventory and other data every day starting on April 4,\u201d Samantha reports. \u201cThe number of people entering hospitals each day for COVID-19 is key data that public health experts monitor to measure the potential strain on hospital systems and the seriousness of the disease\u2019s resurgence.\u201d\u00a0ADADThe news conference was held indoors at the Miami Medical Center, which was turned into a coronavirus nursing facility, Samantha reports.Notably, reporters were not informed before the news conference that there were 18 patients that tested positive for coronavirus at the same facility:\u00a0Another notable moment, shared via Vox\u2019s Aaron Rupar:\u00a0Florida has emerged as the new coronavirus epicenter.\u00a0\u201cNearly 1 out of every 100 residents is infected with the virus, hospital intensive care units are full or filling up, and big-name visitors who chose Florida for their first post-isolation events are now mired in questions and controversies about safety,\u201d Cleve R. Wootson Jr., Isaac Stanley-Becker and Lori Rozsa report. \u201cAmid escalating infections, Florida, once held up by President Trump as a model for how to manage the novel coronavirus, is faring poorly.\u201dThe governor has downplayed the outbreak\u2019s growth, citing expanded testing as a reason for more positive results.\u00a0\u201cHospital leaders, lawmakers, physicians, epidemiologists, advocates and others familiar with the state\u2019s response said a false sense of security set in when grim predictions about the virus\u2019s spread in Florida did not come to pass in March and April. DeSantis declared victory, attending a laudatory news conference at the White House with President Trump,\u201d Cleve, Isaac and Lori write.\u00a0\u201c\u2026 But observers maintain the state then failed to prepare for a surge of the virus, which struck as residents were seeking refuge in air-conditioned indoor spaces, where the virus is believed to be most easily transmitted.\u201d\u00a0Coronavirus latestAnd here are a few more good stories to catch up on this morning:\u00a0Around the world:\u00a0Sweden has allowed life to carry on mostly unrestricted during the pandemic, which led to thousands more deaths than in nearby countries and has not much spared its economy.

How does the law affect the internet?Under the implementation guidance, police can ask technology and telecommunications companies -- be they platforms like Facebook Inc. or Twitter Inc., website hosts like GoDaddy Inc. or internet service providers -- to delete or restrict access to certain messages that authorities deem may endanger national security. The companies have limited options to resist those requests, such as when technology necessary for compliance isn\u2019t immediately available. Otherwise, should a company fail to cooperate immediately, the police may apply for a warrant \u201cto seize the relevant electronic device and take any action for removing that information.\u201dADAD2. What are the penalties?Non-compliance could result in a fine of HK$100,000 (around $13,000) and six months in prison for companies involved in publishing messages that are considered a threat. It\u2019s unclear exactly who at the company would be held liable. For individuals who post offending messages, the fine is the same but the jail term is one year. Separately, the rules state that for the purpose of assisting an investigation, Hong Kong\u2019s justice secretary or police may apply for a court order to require people to answer questions within a specified time period, or to furnish or produce the relevant information or material.3. How worrisome is it?ADA problem with the law is its ambiguity: It\u2019s unclear what types of actions will be considered violations. Since it took effect July 1, police for example have arrested a man for brandishing a Hong Kong independence flag and declared illegal a popular slogan chanted by pro-democracy protesters over months of rallies. For internet users, the concern is that their personal information -- including such things as their contact lists, private posts or messages -- could be shared with authorities, possibly implicating them under the law.AD4. What are the risks for Big Tech?The law presents the likes of Facebook and Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google with a stark dilemma: Bend to the law and risk becoming an accessory to a crackdown on freedoms in Hong Kong at a time when U.S.-China relations are increasingly strained, or simply refuse to comply and depart Hong Kong, much like Google did from China a decade ago for similar reasons. Some social media giants are already facing mounting criticism in their home markets for their role in hate speech and disinformation, and Facebook and others certainly won\u2019t want to expose their reputations to further harm. The law also poses a threat to tech company employees in Hong Kong and abroad, who face possible arrest and prosecution for perceived violations.AD5. Is this like the internet in China?Not really, or not yet anyway. Behind the Great Firewall, China\u2019s online population of 800 million gets a highly restricted internet, one that doesn\u2019t include access to Google, Facebook, YouTube or Western media such as the New York Times. There\u2019s little coverage of the 1989 student protests in Tiananmen Square, for example. Even Winnie the Pooh got temporarily banned when social media users compared him to President Xi Jinping. China is able to control such a vast ocean of content through the largest system of censorship in the world. It\u2019s a joint effort between government monitors and the technology and telecommunications companies compelled to enforce the state\u2019s rules. The stakes go beyond China, which is setting an example that other countries can imitate.AD6. What\u2019s the response been in Hong Kong?ADHours after Hong Kong announced the new powers, Facebook, Google, Twitter, Microsoft Corp. and Zoom Video Communications Inc. all suspended processing requests for data from the Hong Kong government while they review the law. TikTok, the viral video app from Chinese-owned ByteDance Ltd., went even further by withdrawing its service from the territory\u2019s mobile app stores \u201cin light of recent events.\u201d In the city, some people have already deleted their social media accounts. Virtual private networks, or VPNs, designed to disguise a user\u2019s digital footprints, also saw a big spike in downloads. The messaging service Signal, which deliberately collects no data on its users and encrypts their communications, became the most-downloaded app in Hong Kong after the law was imposed.7. Is Hong Kong going to lose Facebook and Google?ADMuch depends on the speed and aggressiveness with which the new law is applied. It\u2019s possible that Big Tech could decide that complying is simply not worth it in terms of political and legal risks to the company as well as to its customers and employees. If Beijing takes a slower approach to putting the law into action, U.S. firms might try to hang in there for as long as they can. \u201cWhile changes to how the internet operates in Hong Kong are likely to proceed slowly, some services could indeed be blocked at some point, particularly those that are perceived by the Chinese government to have facilitated protests,\u201d said Ian Betts, director of risk intelligence with consulting firm Hill & Associates.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P.", "comment": "0 Comments", "topic": "Business"}, {"cover": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/6ZBTTKWCWAI6VCIINCRLT2XJ4A.jpghttps://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/6ZBTTKWCWAI6VCIINCRLT2XJ4A.jpg", "title": "A race is on to make enough small glass vials to deliver coronavirus vaccine around the ", "date": "Jul 13, 2020", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/07/13/coronavirus-vaccine-corning-glass/", "keyword": "China and the world order", "website": "the Washington Post", "author": "Christopher Rowland", "content": "As scientists race to test coronavirus vaccines in humans, a parallel scramble is underway to produce billions of medical-grade vials and syringes that will be needed to inoculate the world\u2019s population.Support our journalism. Subscribe today.arrow-rightThe job of delivering a vaccine to a majority of humans is so vast that global production of pharmaceutical vials needs to be ramped up by 5 to 10 percent within two years, a job the industry says requires immediate preparation and increases in production but is not an insurmountable challenge.Governments and drug companies around the world are placing huge orders worth hundreds of millions of dollars and pushing the makers of vials and syringes to add manufacturing capacity.ADCompared with the rush of laboratory studies and clinical trials needed to produce vaccines that can safely and effectively block the virus, the work of producing vials is prosaic stuff \u2014 but just as important.AD\u201cVials and stoppers are only trivial if you have them. If you don\u2019t have them, they cease to be trivial,\u201d said Awi Federgruen, a professor of logistics and supply chain management at Columbia University. \u201cA shortage of any one of those will act as a bottleneck.\u201dEven in ordinary circumstances, Americans are sometimes subject to vaccine shortages. The most recent example is the shingles vaccine, which is recommended for people over 50 and requires two shots, an initial dose and a booster. GlaxoSmithKline\u2019s Shingrix vaccine was in short supply in 2019 because it was such an improvement over the previous vaccine that demand rose significantly. Now, because fewer people are venturing out for routine care during the coronavirus pandemic, Shingrix is not in shortage, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.ADThe United States also experienced shortages of influenza vaccine in 2004 and 2005.Stay safe and informed with our free Coronavirus Updates newsletterMedical systems are now experiencing unprecedented urgency to develop and distribute coronavirus vaccines, which will create shocks along the supply chain.ADUnder the most optimistic time frames, hundreds of millions of doses of the first vaccines could be available by the end of 2020. The United States, through the Trump administration\u2019s Operation Warp Speed initiative, is locking down supply while prioritizing a boost in domestic manufacturing of medical supplies, many of which are made overseas in Asia and Europe.The approach to vials and syringes is similar to the Trump administration\u2019s strategy regarding drugs: Spend heavily on contracts with the makers of therapeutics and vaccine makers to secure sufficient supply domestically.AD\u201cSo our priorities are very clear. Let\u2019s take care of Americans first,\u201d a senior administration official said on the condition of anonymity under rules set by Operation Warp Speed officials for participation in a telephone briefing on vaccine procurement last month. The administration also is anticipating demand to jump for syringes with the start of influenza season in the fall and wants to avoid bottlenecks that would create shortages of flu vaccine.ADFor coronavirus, the industry is settling on 10-milliliter vials, capable of holding eight to 15 doses, as the most common standard.A big part of the reason for multi-dose vials is to conserve glass supply; for many common vaccines, single-dose vials and single-dose, pre-filled syringes have become commonplace, although multi-dose vials are available as well, according to the CDC.ADCorning, the U.S. glassmaker based in New York, is tapping a $204 million government contract to help accelerate construction of a 2,000-degree furnace in New Jersey that will extrude molten glass into lengths of medical-grade tubing hundreds of feet long. The tubes will be divided into vials and shipped out to be filled with vaccine.\u201cNo one wants to see glass be the reason the world can\u2019t get access,\u201d said Brendan Mosher, vice president and general manager of Corning Pharmaceutical Technologies. \u201cEveryone is working together and has a common goal to make sure there are plenty of vials.\u201dThe U.S. government also is seeking to ramp up domestic supply of syringes. BD, a global medical supply company based in New Jersey that is the largest supplier of syringes in the world, announced last week it is upgrading a factory in Nebraska with help from a $42 million contract with the government. BD already has a contract to sell 50 million syringes to the government. The company said the upgrade will allow it to produce hundreds of millions more syringes for \u201cpriority access\u201d by the U.S. government \u201cto support current and future pandemic efforts.\u201dADADThe Trump administration also awarded contracts of $53 million to a Texas company, Retractable Technologies, to expand its production capacity of syringes, and $138 million to ApiJect Systems, of Stamford, Conn., to boost capacity needed to manufacture 100 million pre-filled syringes.A coronavirus vaccine rooted in a government partnership is fueling financial rewards for company executivesStevanato Group, a global medical glassmaker based in Italy, and other manufacturers have estimated that worldwide demand will rise by 1 billion to 2 billion new glass vials, each capable of holding multiple vaccine doses, over the next two years.Stevanato has received an order from the global nonprofit Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) for 100 million vials that can contain enough vaccine for 20 doses each, enough for 2 billion shots. CEPI has said it is working with nine different companies in the hunt for an effective vaccine. It is investing millions of dollars in manufacturing upgrades for some of those companies to help them prepare ahead of time in the event their vaccines are effective.To get to \u201cherd immunity,\u201d the threshold where the coronavirus is no longer able to easily spread, as many as 5.6 billion of the world\u2019s 8 billion people will need to receive a vaccine. To be effective, a second booster shot a month or so later is likely to be needed for many of the vaccines under development. That means more than 11 billion individual doses may be needed to defeat the virus.The demand for vials has already begun because of the scientific community\u2019s speedy response to develop vaccines. Drugmakers including Johnson & Johnson, AstraZeneca, Merck, Moderna and Novavax \u2014 to name five that the Trump administration\u2019s Operation Warp Speed is supporting \u2014 are preparing to manufacture vaccine in large quantities and fill vials for shipping without even knowing whether their vaccines are effective.ADADThe White House and the Department of Health and Human Services have said hundreds of millions of doses are expected to be ready by the end of 2020. Many experts believe that is an overly optimistic timetable, considering it typically takes years to develop and test a vaccine.The U.S. government is already securing supplies of vials in anticipation of demand. It has signed contracts of $204 million with Corning and $143 million with an Alabama company, SiO2, which makes specialized plastic pharmaceutical vials that the company says withstand breakage and do not require manufacturing by using the extreme heat of a glass furnace.SiO2 will provide 120 million vials for U.S. domestic priorities by the end of 2020 and as many as 1 billion by April 2021 \u2014 which could satisfy a very large portion of the surge in global demand. The company recently announced a $163 million expansion of its manufacturing plant in Auburn, Ala. In March, SiO2 was running at a pace of 14 million vials per year.

In an interview, Stevanato chief executive Franco Stevanato declined to say what state was under consideration for U.S. production but that it probably would be near biopharmaceutical customers.

The border-ignoring virus also infected another world leader, Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, who has repeatedly dismissed it as a \u201clittle cold.\u201dThe Trump administration on Tuesday formally notified the United Nations that it is withdrawing the United States from the WHO, a move that prompted swift criticism from Democrats and showed Trump\u2019s impulse to isolate the country even during a public health crisis. Sen. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.) wrote on Twitter that Trump\u2019s decision \u201cleaves Americans sick & America alone.\u201dADADFBI Director Christopher A. Wray, meanwhile, blasted China for its alleged efforts to steal U.S. technology and said China is trying to penetrate companies that are researching how to defeat the virus.\u201cAt this very moment, China is working to compromise American health-care organizations, pharmaceutical companies and academic institutions conducting essential covid research,\u201d Wray said in remarks at the Hudson Institute, a conservative think tank in Washington.His remarks came as cases and hospitalizations in the United States continued to mount. More than 50 hospitals in Florida said their ICUs are full, according to data from Florida\u2019s Agency for Health Care Administration. In another hot spot, Arizona reported 117 deaths on Tuesday, a daily record for the state, as more than 3,000 people were being treated in hospitals and ICU beds neared capacity. Texas canceled its annual state fair, the longest-running fair in the country, as more than 8,000 Texans were hospitalized on Monday, a third higher than last week.ADADOhio Gov. Mike DeWine (R) issued an order Tuesday requiring residents to wear masks in public in seven counties, including those that are home to Cincinnati and Cleveland.Trump administration health officials announced Tuesday that they are moving medical support into three areas of \u201crecent and intense\u201d outbreaks in Texas, Louisiana and Florida. That includes Jacksonville, Fla., the site of the Republican National Convention, where Trump is expected to be formally nominated next month as the GOP candidate.Trump\u2019s handling of the pandemic, which has been most extensive and deadliest in the United States, drew renewed criticism from presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden on Tuesday. Biden issued a plan for how he would respond to such pandemics, creating a sharp contrast with the Trump administration\u2019s approach.ADAD\u201cDonald Trump needs to do his job,\u201d Biden wrote on Twitter on Tuesday.Biden\u2019s plan calls for  increasing federal stockpiles of medical supplies and requiring companies to develop strategies to address supply chain disruptions, among other measures, as a way to limit the nation\u2019s dependence on other countries in times of crisis.The blueprint is meant to serve as a rebuttal to Trump\u2019s positioning himself as an \u201cAmerica first\u201d president, according to a senior Biden campaign official who noted the president\u2019s tagline and was critical of his record. Biden\u2019s plan would initiate a 100-day review period upon taking office to \u201cidentify critical national security risks across America\u2019s international supply chains.\u201dADThe United States has reported nearly 3\u00a0million confirmed virus cases to date, meaning nearly 1 in every 110 Americans has been found to have the virus, with large swaths of the country not having been tested.ADAt least 128,000 deaths have been linked to the virus nationwide, with the United States having more than twice as many reported deaths as any other country and the nation accounting for nearly a quarter of all virus-related deaths worldwide.More than 890 U.S. deaths were reported Tuesday, the highest total in 12 days, amid signs the country\u2019s death rate might be creeping up after falling for the past three months.Trump has repeatedly complained that not enough attention is being paid to the country\u2019s death rate.AD\u201cWe have the lowest Mortality Rate in the World. The Fake News should be reporting these most important of facts, but they don\u2019t!\u201d Trump tweeted.Scientists say many countries have lower death rates than the United States.The nation\u2019s top infectious-disease expert, Anthony S. Fauci, said Tuesday that although the fatality rate of the coronavirus has dropped, Americans should not be complacent.AD\u201cIt\u2019s a false narrative to take comfort in a lower rate of death,\u201d Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said during a Facebook Live news conference with Sen. Doug Jones (D-Ala.). \u201cThere\u2019s so many other things that are very dangerous and bad about this virus.\u201dADThe lower mortality rate is a result of two factors, he said. The country has gotten better at treating people, particularly through therapies that work in the advanced stages of the disease. And, Fauci said, the mean age of those getting infected has dropped by about 15 years.Compared with the older population, young people generally face less-severe consequences from the virus, unless they have underlying medical complications, he said. Still, some young people have been hospitalized or have required intensive care, and there could be long-term health implications.AD\u201cThe death rate is lower, I admit that, because people in general who are young are healthier,\u201d Fauci said. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean that you could not get seriously ill.\u201dIn Brazil, home to the world\u2019s second-worst outbreak, President Bolsonaro became at least the third world leader to contract the virus. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson was treated in intensive care in April and has since recovered. Honduran President Juan Orlando Hern\u00e1ndez, who was hospitalized last month, said last week that he was leaving the hospital and returning to work.ADBolsonaro, 65, has repeatedly played down the seriousness of the pandemic, even as Brazil has reported more than 1.6\u00a0million confirmed cases and 65,000 deaths. He has been a skeptic of the pandemic as he has pushed Brazilians to get back to work and saying that with his own \u201chistory as an athlete, if I were infected by the virus, I wouldn\u2019t need to worry.\u201dADHe was tested after developing symptoms that included a fever.Tensions about how to handle border-hopping during the outbreak also flared again this week.New federal guidance that international students must take classes in person to legally stay in the United States this fall has left university officials scrambling to adapt while making students fearful of deportation. The guidance from the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency said that foreign students won\u2019t be allowed to have visas for programs that are fully online during the fall semester, nor will they be allowed into the country. Though some universities, including Harvard, have pledged to create an on-campus experience for students \u2014 especially those in their first year \u2014 many have said classes will be online only even if students are on campus.ADADThe White House, meanwhile, has been pushing for schools to open in the fall. Trump said he would pressure governors to open buildings because in-person education is essential for the well-being of students, parents, and the country. \u201cWe want to reopen the schools,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want people to make political statements or do it for political reasons. They think it\u2019s going to be good for them politically, so they keep schools closed. No way.\u201dThe Trump administration is also seeking to expand testing in hard-hit areas. The Department of Health and Human Services said that it is dispatching private contractors to three communities \u2014 Edinburg, Tex.; Baton Rouge; and Jacksonville \u2014 to administer 5,000 free tests per day in coming weeks.\u201cThe Trump administration is doubling down on support to areas hard hit by covid-19,\u201d the illness caused by the virus, said Brett P. Giroir, an HHS assistant secretary who is the administration\u2019s coordinator for diagnostic testing for the virus.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also published a study on Tuesday that offered further evidence that the virus disproportionately affects workers of color. The study looked at workers in 329 U.S. meat and poultry facilities across 23 states and found that the majority of cases occurred among Hispanic employees (56\u00a0percent), followed by 19\u00a0percent in black employees, 13\u00a0percent in white employees and 12\u00a0percent in Asian employees.The rates are disproportionate to employee demographics at the facilities. The workforce breakdown is 39\u00a0percent white, 30\u00a0percent Hispanic, 25\u00a0percent black and 6\u00a0percent Asian, the report said.Meat and poultry plant workers are particularly vulnerable to the rapid spread of the virus because of the working and living conditions that are common in the industry: prolonged close contact among co-workers, eight- to 12-hour shifts, shared workspaces, group housing and shared transportation.\n\nEmily Rauhala, Devlin Barrett, Amy Goldstein, Brittany Shammas, Sean Sullivan, Laura Meckler and Terrence McCoy contributed to this report.", "comment": "0 Comments", "topic": "National"}, {"cover": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ZMKKHKV364I6VF6BNTYRN77CNQ.jpghttps://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ZMKKHKV364I6VF6BNTYRN77CNQ.jpg", "title": "U.S. Cases Top 50,000;  Stamps Out Flareup: Virus Update", "date": "Jul 2, 2020", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/on-small-business/us-cases-top-50000-china-stamps-out-flareup-virus-update/2020/07/01/abfe9b28-bc11-11ea-97c1-6cf116ffe26c_story.html", "keyword": "China and the world order", "website": "the Washington Post", "author": "", "content": "U.S. cases jumped the most since May 9 and Florida\u2019s new coronavirus infections rose by a record.

The new law mocks the rule of law, which requires sufficient specificity to give those subject to the law due notice of what is proscribed or prohibited. The new law stipulates four major offenses: separatism, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign governments. These will be defined post facto, in capricious enforcements against those whose speech is not chilled by the law\u2019s menacing vagueness. The \u201claw\u201d authorizing the committee to operate secretly was released at 11 p.m. Tuesday, probably to deter demonstrations on Wednesday, which was the anniversary of the 1997 handover.Modern technologies of communication enable the world to watch darkness descend on one of the world\u2019s most vibrant metropolises. Modern technologies of surveillance enable Beijing to refine a deep, penetrating oppression beyond what Winston Churchill could have imagined when he warned that Nazism\u2019s triumph would mean the world would \u201csink into the abyss of a new Dark Age made more sinister, and perhaps more protracted, by the lights of perverted science.\u201dADADChina\u2019s faux law, which echoes Stalin\u2019s use of randomness to intensify fear, serves two purposes: It smashes Hong Kong dissent \u2014 Leninism brooks no challenge to the party\u2019s supremacy. And it distracts attention from reports that Beijing is pioneering a sinister fusionism that melds Leninism and Stalinism with an ethno-nationalism reminiscent of fascism.The regime reportedly is employing forced abortions and sterilization to inflict what has been called \u201cdemographic genocide\u201d on Muslim Uighurs and other minorities. U.S. customs officials have seized some China-made beauty products perhaps made from human hair harvested in Xinjiang concentration camps. China\u2019s signatures on the U.N. Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide and on the Sino-British Joint Declaration guaranteeing Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy are equally constraining. Next year, President Joe Biden and a Democratic-controlled Congress should match Britain\u2019s generosity in welcoming refugees from Hong Kong\u2019s talented, freedom-loving citizenry.In diplomatic parlance, China is a \u201crevisionist\u201d power, aiming to revise the global order. In less antiseptic language, it is a piratical power whose crudeness, born of cultural condescension toward others, includes special contempt for an America distracted domestically by various hysterias, and choosing retreat abroad. President Biden\u2019s urgent foreign policy tasks will include revising the long-standing U.S. policy of \u201cstrategic ambiguity\u201d regarding Taiwan. Beijing is demonstrating in Hong Kong \u201cone country, two systems\u201d actually means one country, one simmering stew of Leninism and Stalinism flavored with fascism.ADADThe dictator Xi Jinping has repeatedly said that Taiwan\u2019s current status \u2014 nationhood in all but name \u2014 is intolerable and \u201cshould not be passed down generation after generation.\u201d A reelected President Trump, whose cramped notion of America\u2019s role in the world is confined to commercial bookkeeping, might swap Taiwan\u2019s freedom for increased Chinese purchases of U.S. soybeans. When at noon Jan. 20 the United States ends the policy of making America marginal again, Biden should adopt strategic clarity, informing Beijing that the U.S. legal obligation to sell Taiwan weaponry needed for self-defense entails a moral obligation to assist with that project.The Korean War, which brought Americans into combat against Chinese troops, began 70 years ago after Dean Acheson, President Harry S. Truman\u2019s secretary of state, gave a speech in which he left South Korea outside his definition of America\u2019s defense perimeter. Beijing has drawn a \u201cnine-dash line\u201d to demarcate extravagant claims to sovereignty over the South China Sea \u2014 claims incompatible with international law and disdainful of the legal rights of various nations in the region. The Biden administration should draw a line that places Taiwan within the sphere of regional nations whose self-defense implicates vital U.S. interests.Beijing should remember this: France\u2019s Committee of Public Safety was created in April 1793. Maximilien Robespierre, who prefigured Lenin, joined it on July 27. One year and a day later, devoured by forces he had fomented, he was guillotined in Paris\u2019s Place de la R\u00e9volution, now called Place de la Concorde.

Subscribe today.arrow-right\u201cAs far as TikTok is concerned, we\u2019re banning them from the United States,\u201d Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One.Earlier Friday, Trump was considering signing an order forcing China\u2019s ByteDance to sell off the U.S. portion of TikTok over national security concerns, according to people familiar with the talks, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss them publicly. One of the individuals confirmed Microsoft was in the lead to acquire the popular platform\u2019s U.S. service.While the order was expected to be signed Friday, people had warned that it could fall through since the president was also considering other approaches, including designating TikTok under an executive order that allows the president to exclude national security threats from U.S. networks.Late Friday, the president told reporters he was not in favor of a deal to let a U.S. company buy TikTok\u2019s U.S. operations. Trump said he could use emergency economic powers or an executive order to ban TikTok.ADAD\u201cWell, I have that authority. I can do it with an executive order or that,\u201d he said, referring to emergency economic powers.The order that would force a sale, which stems from a national security investigation, is fairly rare but has been used by Trump as recently as March, when the president ordered a Chinese company to sell its stake in a U.S. hotel-software company. Last year, the Trump administration used it to demand the Chinese owners of gay dating app Grindr give up control of the company.If Microsoft did acquire TikTok, it would make it a major rival to Facebook, Google\u2019s YouTube and other tech giants overnight, dramatically reshaping the U.S. social media landscape. ADThe prospect of a forced sale came amid growing concern among U.S. officials that the Chinese government could access users\u2019 private data, something that prompted Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to say earlier this month that the United States is \u201ccertainly looking at\u201d banning TikTok.ADBranches of the U.S. military, including the Army and Navy, have banned the app from government-issued phones. The Pentagon urged its employees last year to uninstall the app due to security concerns.On Friday, Trump reiterated that option. \u201cWe may be banning TikTok,\u201d Trump told reporters before leaving for Florida. \u201cWe may be doing some other things. There are a couple of options. But a lot of things are happening, so we\u2019ll see what happens. But we are looking at a lot of alternatives with respect to TikTok.\u201dADTikTok spokesperson Hilary McQuaide declined to comment on the expected order, but she said they are \u201cconfident in the long-term success of TikTok.\u201d Microsoft spokesman Frank Shaw declined to comment. Bloomberg News first reported the news on the divestiture.The other order the government could apply is the 2019 International Economic Emergency Powers Act, which effectively bans any communications tool that is a national security threat to the United States.ADIf Trump uses the \u201cfull force\u201d of the remedies under the executive order, said Stewart Baker, a former National Security Agency general counsel, \u201cNo American could work for them. The app store couldn\u2019t make them available. American advertisers couldn\u2019t pay them for ads. It would be economically devastating for them.\u201dADTikTok has continually insisted that it does not hand over information to the Chinese government. \u201cWe have never provided user data to the Chinese government, nor would we do so if asked,\u201d McQuaide said earlier this month.The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, an interagency body whose powers were strengthened by 2018 legislation, recommends to the president whether certain proposed takeovers should be rejected, and whether completed takeovers should be reversed, on national security grounds. CFIUS began investigating an acquisition by Beijing-based ByteDance after lawmakers asked the government to step in over national security concerns.ADByteDance bought karaoke app Musical.ly in 2017 and merged it with TikTok, launching the app to mass popularity in the United States.ADJames Andrew Lewis, vice president of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said foreign companies usually take the hint when they think a demand from the U.S. government will be coming.\u201cUsually everyone gets the message and takes action without waiting for formal government action,\u201d he said.TikTok says it will let U.S. skeptics see its code to defray privacy concernsBuying TikTok could reshape the Big Tech landscape, giving Microsoft a strong foothold in the U.S. consumer market with one of the world\u2019s fastest growing social media platforms. Unlike many of its competitors, Microsoft does not have a creative social media company to sow brand recognition with younger users, though the Redmond, Wash.-based company does own professional networking site LinkedIn.ADADWhile the acquisition could raise some antitrust eyebrows, regulators haven\u2019t typically blocked acquisitions of business lines that are dissimilar from what a company already does. Microsoft also has deep ties with the U.S. government, most recently winning the Pentagon\u2019s JEDI cloud computing contract. Microsoft as a buyer could help quell administration security concerns about TikTok data.Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg called out TikTok as a rival during a congressional antitrust hearing earlier this week, at which Microsoft was noticeably absent.TikTok has tried in recent months to convince U.S. users and regulators of its strong ties to the country. It emphasizes that it has hundreds of employees in the United States and even hired former Disney executive Kevin Mayer to be its new chief executive in May.ADADOn Wednesday, Mayer pledged the company will allow U.S. regulators and privacy experts to take a closer look under its digital hood, offering them the ability to \u201cexamine\u201d its underlying software code in response to claims it is handing off data to the Chinese government.The app, which lets users create and post short videos with music and other effects, has surged in popularity even more during the coronavirus pandemic as people search for at-home activities and distractions. Teens are especially active on TikTok, creating videos showcasing their dancing, pranks and cooking skills.This is the latest in a string of moves by the Trump administration to counter Chinese tech giants.ADTension has already come to a head over Chinese telecom giant Huawei, the world\u2019s largest provider of mobile network gear \u2014 a field from which U.S. companies are largely absent. The United States calls Huawei a security risk, which the company denies, and has undertaken an international lobbying campaign to persuade other countries not to buy from Huawei.ADThe Trump administration has also targeted other Chinese companies, restricting trade with more than a dozen it accuses of supplying surveillance gear in the western province of Xinjiang, where U.S. officials and human rights groups say China\u2019s ruling Communist Party is holding Muslims in mass detention camps.U.S. government investigating TikTok over national security concernsThe Trump administration has also previously used CFIUS to scrutinize, block or reverse Chinese acquisitions.In March, Trump ordered a Chinese company to divest all ownership of a U.S. hotel-software company, saying the Beijing investor could harm U.S. national security. A written order from the president\u2019s office suggested the administration was concerned about Chinese access to StayNTouch\u2019s hotel-guest data.The order, which followed a CFIUS review, instructed the Chinese company to immediately to refrain from accessing any of StayNTouch\u2019s hotel-guest data.ADThe Chinese company, Beijing Shiji Information Technology, acquired StayNTouch in 2018, saying the U.S. company\u2019s software was used in connection with 90,000 hotel rooms globally.After the order was issued, Beijing Shiji said it was \u201cnot a threat to U.S. security in any way.\u201d\u201cWe offered a range of significant proposals to mitigate any concerns the U.S. government might have, including further restricting access to guest data and appointing an independent monitor to ensure these protections. Unfortunately, those offers were rebuffed,\u201d the company said at the time.In 2018, after a CFIUS review, Trump ordered Singapore-based Broadcom to abandon its $117 billion bid for the U.S. semiconductor company Qualcomm, blocking what would have been one of the biggest technology deals in history.A full presidential order isn\u2019t always required to block or reverse a deal. Lawyers familiar with CFIUS reviews say the national security committee can tell a foreign company: sell the asset or the president will issue an order.That appears to be what happened last year, when the Trump administration forced a Chinese company to sell its majority stake in a U.S. health-care-data company, PatientsLikeMe.When Pompeo said earlier this month that TikTok might be banned, frantic users took to the app to bemoan its potential demise and urge followers to find them on other social media sites.TikTok users fear app shutdown as security concerns grow\u201cI really hope that this will not happen,\u201d one user said in a video. \u201cAll the videos, all the memories of you.

Subscribe today.arrow-rightJuly 25The New York Times on political conventions and President Donald Trump canceling the Republican National Committee\u2019s nominating convention in Florida:President Trump announced on Thursday that, in deference to the pandemic, he was canceling the portion of the Republican National Committee\u2019s nominating convention scheduled to take place in Jacksonville, Fla., late next month.\u201cWe won\u2019t do a big, crowded convention, per se \u2014 it\u2019s not the right time for that,\u201d the president said during his daily coronavirus briefing, noting that he \u201cfelt it was wrong\u201d to have hordes of people heading into \u201ca hot spot.\u201d Mr. Trump added he\u2019d told his advisers, \u201cThere\u2019s nothing more important in our country than keeping our people safe.\u201dADBetter late than never.ADMr. Trump\u2019s coronation party originally was planned for Charlotte, N.C., which is where much of the convention\u2019s official business will still take place. In June, however, the president relocated all the flashy bits, including his acceptance speech, to Florida, after North Carolina officials refused to guarantee him the overcrowded, non-socially distanced spectacle he wanted.Florida, however, is now in the throes of a Covid-19 spike. The state reported on Thursday 10,249 new cases and 173 deaths, a record. Bringing thousands of conventiongoers into the mix would have been a recipe for more tragic outcomes.Instead of an arena full of cheering fans, Mr. Trump must content himself with \u201ctele-rallies,\u201d other virtual events and maybe some smaller gatherings. This is surely a bitter pill for the president, who draws energy from large, adoring crowds. But this moment of crisis also provides his party \u2014 both parties, for that matter \u2014 with an opportunity to reimagine and reshape their conventions into something more engaging and possibly more relevant to the American public.ADADThe convention of conventions is overdue for an overhaul. Why not make necessity the mother of reinvention?Much of what goes on at national conventions is not meant for consumption by the general public. Once upon a time, serious nominating business was conducted at these gatherings, but those days are gone. And for all the quadrennial chatter about the possibility of a brokered convention, the parties knock themselves out to avoid that kind of drama, even in cycles with ugly primaries.Nowadays, conventions are in large part extended reunions, awash in booze, food, music and elbow rubbing between elected officials, lobbyists, activists, operatives, celebrities, fund-raisers, journalists and other players. They are, in some ways, politics at its swampiest.ADThe parts produced for at-home viewers are dominated by speeches \u2014 many of them boring, vapid or even frightening, with an eye toward whipping up the party faithful. The lineups typically feature political stars, up-and-comers the party wants to spotlight (Barack Obama in 2004, Bill Clinton in 1988) and members of Congress. Former primary rivals often appear as a show of party unity, and members of the nominee\u2019s family are trotted out. Then there are the celebrities brought in for a dash of pizazz, like Meryl Streep, will.i.am and Katy Perry. (Such appearances don\u2019t always go over as planned, as when Clint Eastwood conducted a much-mocked chat with an empty chair at the 2012 Republican convention.)ADThere has got to be a better way.As it happens, Democrats have been working on this issue for some time, having realized several weeks ago that they needed to shift to a largely virtual gathering. The fine-tuning is still in progress, but some details are available. Airtime will be slashed and the speaking lineup shortened, Joe Solmonese, the chief executive of this year\u2019s convention, told the editorial board. \u201cWe want to be concise and respect people\u2019s time.\u201dADThe proceedings will also be more geographically dispersed. Delegates and public officials aren\u2019t gathering in the host city of Milwaukee. Joe Biden will deliver his speech from there, and his vice-presidential pick will be on site for part of the week. But many speakers will be scattered across battleground states and other meaningful locales, based on each evening\u2019s theme.AD\u201cWe\u2019re going to be very much grounded in the moment we\u2019re in,\u201d said Mr. Solmonese. \u201cSo when it comes time to talk about education and the tough decisions parents will make about their kids going back to school, we\u2019re going to go to the places those conversations are happening.\u201d The same holds for the public health responders dealing with Covid-19 and the small businesses fighting for survival, he said, noting that having to think beyond the convention location \u201ccreates an opportunity for us to go where we think there are important stories to be told.\u201dWith a nod to social distancing, the stage will feature a multiscreen Zoom layout on which political V.I.P.s and regular Americans will participate in a remote roll call vote. Dreamers and union members and activists will chime in from \u201ciconic or message-based locations in 57 states and territories across America,\u201d according to an internal party memo obtained by The Daily Beast. These will include the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Ala., the site of the Bloody Sunday civil rights clash in 1965.ADUsing resonant locations and nonfamous faces to spotlight important issues is a smart move. Message: This election is not about partisan games or insiders\u2019 egos. It is about the nation\u2019s collective future.ADAs for the themes conveyed, anything that focuses on comforting and healing the nation is likely to play well in these unsettling times \u2014 and speaks to Mr. Biden\u2019s particular brand. For nonincumbents, conventions are about introducing the nominee to voters. There will, of course, be gauzy videos telling Mr. Biden\u2019s life story. Cutting down on the speechifying and focusing on real people\u2019s stories is also less likely to put viewers to sleep.The Republicans and Mr. Trump are facing a slightly different challenge \u2014 with significantly less time to adapt. At this point, most Americans already have a clear view of the president. He will not be introducing himself to the nation so much as he will be attempting to rebrand himself.ADWith his polls numbers slipping, it\u2019s clear Mr. Trump needs a retool. For starters, he could drop the self-pitying talk about how unfair everyone has been to him and make a positive case for why he deserves to be re-elected. Central to this: He needs to articulate his vision and priorities for a second term. The president has been asked this question repeatedly of late, and he has consistently failed to offer a coherent answer. A (virtual) convention celebrating his renomination seems the obvious place to correct that.ADPageantry and celebrities have their place. Who doesn\u2019t love a good balloon drop? But this year, the entire nation is under enormous strain. Americans want to know that the presidential contenders understand and care about their problems \u2014 and, more than that, that they are focused intently on how to solve those problems.Online: https://www.nytimes.com/AD___July 28The Seattle Times on a judge ordering journalist to turn over unpublished content, including photos, to police:A King County judge\u2019s order that The Seattle Times and other media must turn over unpublished content to the police is a blow to independent journalism.The order imperils journalists documenting this summer\u2019s historic protests and sends the wrong message about the media as a check on government power.Journalists\u2019 unique role and responsibility is protected in Washington\u2019s shield law, passed by legislators in 2007. The law prohibits officials from forcing journalists to turn over unpublished information outside of specific and narrow circumstances. King County Superior Court Judge Nelson Lee\u2019s recent order that The Seattle Times and four other news outlets must hand unpublished protest video and photos to police investigators is a troubling interpretation of that law.ADADPolice want the journalists\u2019 images to help identify suspects who set fire to police cars and stole police firearms during a May 30 protest in downtown Seattle. Certainly, those involved in the crimes should be held accountable. But even the mistaken conflation of journalists with police investigators can directly impact news gatherers\u2019 ability to do their work.In volatile situations like recent protests, this misconception can \u2014 and has \u2014 led to physical violence.As the National Press Photographers Association and Press Freedom Defense Fund wrote in a joint statement about Lee\u2019s decision, \u201cIt is dangerous enough for visual journalists to be covering the COVID-19 pandemic and the protests over the death of George Floyd. The last thing visual journalists want is to be seen as an arm of law enforcement, aiding attempts to gather evidence.\u201dADAs Seattle Times assistant managing editor Danny Gawlowski wrote in a declaration submitted to the court, even before the court ruling, Times photo journalists have had to repeatedly explain their independence to protesters. During one early protest, a Times staff photographer was hit in the head by a rock and punched in the face.The U.S. Press Freedom Tracker has verified more than 585 incidents of journalists being assaulted, arrested or otherwise prevented from reporting during this summer\u2019s protests in dozens of cities.Independence from political and commercial influence is the backbone of responsible journalism. Journalists must report in the public interest, not in the service of government.Journalists are facing enormous challenges as they report this historic moment. The court\u2019s decision threatens to make a bad situation worse.Online: https://www.seattletimes.com/___July 28The Los Angeles Times on a new coronavirus relief package:At the moment, Congress has two tasks more important than any others: Providing the resources and leadership needed to defeat the COVID-19 pandemic, and helping the country climb out of the deep recession that the pandemic triggered. Sadly, the long-awaited coronavirus relief package that Senate Republicans released this week falls far short on both fronts.The need for a fourth major congressional effort became clear not long after states abandoned their stay-at-home orders, leading infection rates to skyrocket. The one thing lawmakers should have been able to agree on immediately is a major increase in funding for testing and contact tracing so that states could better identify where and how the disease was spreading. But in addition to being many days late, Senate Republicans are coming to the table many dollars short on this front. Its proposal includes $16 billion for testing, compared to the $75 billion recommended by a number of healthcare analysts and public health experts.There is nothing more important to people\u2019s lives and livelihoods than corralling the novel coronavirus. Now is not the time for parsimony.The GOP package\u2019s efforts to boost the economy are similarly halfhearted, starting with the proposal to renew the higher unemployment benefits that Congress authorized in March at a significantly lower level: an additional $200 per week instead of $600. The $200 would lapse at the end of September, after which the additional payment would raise unemployed workers\u2019 benefits to 70% of their previous wages (state benefits currently replace 40% to 50% of an idled worker\u2019s wages).The $600 add-on expires this week. Republicans balked at extending it because, they argued, it discouraged laid-off people from returning to work. The federal aid did allow most unemployment workers to make as much as or more than they\u2019d been paid in their last job, but it\u2019s far from clear that masses of Americans were turning down offers of work in defiance of state requirements. To the contrary, employment data from June showed that millions of laid-off Americans did take jobs, but also that there were far more unemployed people than there were jobs available. You can\u2019t take a job that doesn\u2019t exist.Also hugely problematic: It will take months to upgrade the antiquated unemployment systems in many states to make the change the Senate GOP has proposed, which makes it all but unachievable. The operational costs of those systems, by the way, are largely the federal government\u2019s responsibility.The extra benefits allowed millions of idled workers to pay their bills, boosting the consumer spending that is the lifeblood of the U.S. economy. The total was about $75 billion a month, economist Gus Faucher of PNC said, adding, \u201cIf you take that out of people\u2019s pockets, they\u2019re going to stop spending it.\u201dContinuing those extra benefits is a much more efficient way to pump money into the economy than cutting low- and middle-income families a check, as Congress did in March and the GOP proposes to do again.The package includes badly needed aid for schools but ignores the plight of state and local governments hard hit by the recession, setting the stage for more layoffs and cuts in vital government services. It also seeks to boost businesses through more federal loans for small businesses, an effort that, while good in concept, has been marred by poor targeting and execution.One other piece is a proposal to make businesses immune to COVID-19-related lawsuits until October 2024, retroactive to last December. It is strikingly one-sided, completely excusing companies and institutions from liability for negligent acts that spread the disease. They\u2019d even be shielded from liability for gross negligence if they made \u201creasonable\u201d efforts to comply with vague governmental guidelines.Any liability shield should either come with an alternate way for injured people to seek compensation from the government, as is the case with vaccines, or with specific standards that companies must meet for protecting their workers and customers from COVID-19. Besides, contrary to the proposal\u2019s ominous warnings, there\u2019s been no \u201ctidal wave\u201d of lawsuits from consumers; according to a complaint tracker by the Hunton Andrews Kurth law firm, consumers have filed fewer than a dozen COVID-19 related claims in the past month and a half, despite the broad move to reopen businesses.Some Republicans have balked at the idea of providing any further federal aid because of the record-setting deficit. Such fiscal responsibility would have been more welcome when the economy was growing and the GOP was cutting taxes and throwing money at the Pentagon. The human and economic problems caused by COVID-19 are enormous and ongoing, and they demand a commensurate response.Online: https://www.latimes.com/___July 28The Washington Post on aid packages for child care services and child caretakers:With schools shuttered and child-care options restricted, working parents across the country are shouldering unexpected child-care burdens. Many will not be able to return to work until they can find safe, affordable child care. At the same time, the child-care industry is collapsing under pandemic-inflicted financial pressure. Without swift action from Congress, child-care centers are at risk of permanent closures that could severely undermine the country\u2019s economic recovery.Unlike public schools, child-care centers are largely funded by parents\u2019 tuition payments. Even before the pandemic, most child-care centers were barely profitable. At the peak of the crisis, one-third of the child-care workforce lost their jobs, and about 60 percent of child-care programs temporarily closed. Now, those that survive are implementing virus prevention measures that reduce enrollment \u2014 and revenue \u2014 while increasing operating costs. Half the industry is at risk for permanent closure, which would mean millions of lost child-care slots, according to an estimate from the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank.Such losses would present many parents with terrible choices. In the absence of safe, affordable child care, should parents place their children in unlicensed or lower-quality facilities during a public health crisis, or spend more than they can reasonably afford on child care for those lucky enough to have a safe option nearby? For lower-income families, the lack of affordable child care could mean giving up work outside the home and sliding into poverty. Black and brown parents are more likely than white parents to experience job disruptions due to child care.Democrats and Republicans in Congress both have introduced measures that would help stabilize the industry. The Democratic-backed Child Care Is Essential Act would provide $50 billion in funding to child-care centers through the Child Care and Development Block Grant (CCDBG), which provides federal funding to states to subsidize child care for working families. The Republican-backed measure would fund child-care providers through the CCDBG for up to nine months. Experts estimate that the child-care industry needs $9.6 billion a month to stay afloat, much more than the $3.5 billion the industry received in spring\u2019s coronavirus legislation.To prevent mass closures of child-care providers, Congress must prioritize industry-wide relief. But even an emergency rescue would not address the underlying issues associated with the chronic underfunding of caregiving. Last week, former vice president Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, unveiled a proposal to invest $775 billion over 10 years in caregiving programs for small children, older Americans and those with disabilities. This ambitious proposal is a welcome and unprecedented acknowledgment that caregiving is central to a fully functioning economy. Though it is largely focused on bolstering America\u2019s caregiving infrastructure in the medium term, Mr. Biden\u2019s plan also mentions fiscal relief to keep child-care services running \u2014 a recognition that, without stabilization efforts now, there may not be an industry left to bolster.Online: https://www.washingtonpost.com/___July 28The Japan News on the relationship between the United States and China:The escalating confrontation between the United States and China, the world\u2019s two largest economies, could further destabilize the international situation. Both countries should realize their heavy responsibilities and stop the chain of retaliation.The United States has shut down the Chinese Consulate General in Houston, Texas, in the southwestern part of the country, on the ground that it was used as a \u201chub of Chinese spying.\u201dAs a countermeasure, China has closed the U.S. Consulate General in Chengdu, Sichuan Province, and claimed that some personnel at the consulate general were \u201cconducting activities not in line with their identities.\u201dThe role of a consulate general is to protect its own country\u2019s citizens, be aware of the situation in the country where it is located and engage in dialogue and exchange with the host country. However, taking advantage of a Vienna Convention article on the inviolability of foreign diplomatic missions, major powers often engage in intense intelligence-gathering activities.There are many cases in which a diplomat who is believed to be a spy is deported. However, it is unusual for a country to close a diplomatic mission of another country without specifying concrete illicit activities of that country. This can be regarded as a serious aspect of the confrontation between the United States and China.The practice of using the closure of diplomatic missions as a sanction must not spread to other countries and hamper legitimate diplomatic activities.The United States has made it clearer that it will step up pressure on China. Based on a ruling in 2016 by an international tribunal at The Hague, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said that China\u2019s claims of maritime interests in the South China Sea were \u201ccompletely illegal.\u201dIn his policy speech on China, Pompeo stated that engagement with China by past U.S. administrations that aimed to incorporate China into the international community had been a failure, and called for a change in the engagement policy. He also stressed the need for democratic countries to unite to contain China.It cannot be denied that the administration of Chinese President Xi Jinping has not listened to warnings from the international community, and has taken measures that ignored the rule of law, trade rules and human rights. It is pressing ahead with its militarization in the South China Sea, as well as breaking an international promise and depriving Hong Kong of its freedom and threatening the world order.It is understandable that the United States is trying to change China\u2019s behavior. The question is how and when.As opportunities for dialogue between the United States and China have been reduced due to the spread of the novel coronavirus, continued retaliatory battles could escalate tensions and develop into an unforeseen conflict. If the United States takes excessive hard-line measures, it will not be able to win the support of Japan and European countries.Suspicions still linger that U.S. President Donald Trump is showing a confrontational attitude toward China in order to strengthen his support for the presidential election in November. The Xi administration also is apparently being forced to take a hard-line attitude toward the United States to avoid domestic criticism of a \u201csoft attitude\u201d and maintain its prestige.Both the United States and China must regain their composure and find ways to settle the situation.Online: https://the-japan-news.com/___July 27The Wall Street Journal on weekend police brutality protests:Riots broke out again this weekend from coast to coast, with violence and vandalism damaging more of urban America. Democrats and their media allies insist these are largely peaceful protests, so it\u2019s worth examining what really happened.On Saturday in Seattle, protesters gathered outside the juvenile court and detention facility, set fire to portable trailers, and smashed the windows of nearby cars and businesses. An explosive device gashed an eight-inch hole in the side of the Seattle Police Department\u2019s East Precinct, and rioters threw fireworks, stones and other projectiles at law enforcement.\u201cIn all 59 officers were injured throughout the day with one of those being hospitalized,\u201d the police department reported, and \u201cinjuries ranged from abrasions and bruising to burns and a torn meniscus.\u201dSimilar scenes unfolded in Portland as rioters tried to tear down the fence surrounding the Hatfield Federal Courthouse. Demonstrators threw Molotov cocktails Friday night, and after midnight one federal officer took \u201ca direct hit from a commercial grade firework,\u201d another \u201cwas hit with a mortar firework,\u201d and a third \u201cwas struck in the head with a mortar firework,\u201d the Department of Homeland Security says. Peaceful?DHS says some 5,000 or 6,000 returned to the scene on Sunday, threw smoke bombs and launched \u201ca roughly 10-minute-long continuous firework attack against the courthouse.\u201d DHS says at least 20 federal officers sustained injuries in Portland.In Louisville, Ky., a black militia that calls itself the \u201cNot F\u2014 Around Coalition\u201d lived up to its name Saturday when a member discharged a gun and accidentally struck three compatriots, causing non-life-threatening injuries. In Oakland, Calif., rioters set fires downtown Saturday night, including at the Alameda County Superior Courthouse. In New York City, demonstrators defaced police vans with spray paint and tried to smash their windows, while others lit trash cans on fire. Demonstrators carried out more vandalism at a federal building in Atlanta and a Fraternal Order of Police lodge in Baltimore.This list isn\u2019t exhaustive, and it undermines the claim that the Trump Administration has deployed federal agents to suppress peaceful dissent. Federal officers protecting federal property are now the targets of demonstrators, not the instigators of violence. The real blame lies with progressive city leaders, who have all but promised violent protesters that they can act with impunity.Portland recently imposed sweeping restrictions on when police can use tear gas to disperse protesters. Seattle passed a similar ordinance banning tear gas, blast balls and other less-than-lethal weapons\u2014even after Police Chief Carmen Best warned that such restrictions leave officers with \u201cno ability to safely intercede to preserve property in the midst of a large, violent crowd\u201d and may \u201ccreate even more dangerous circumstances for our officers to intervene using what they have left\u2014riot shields and riot batons.\u201dFederal Judge James Robart issued an injunction against the Seattle ordinance last week after the federal government expressed similar concerns, but it\u2019s only temporary. Other Democratic-run cities have passed or are pursuing similar bans.The weekend\u2019s events were a deliberate assault on public and private property, law enforcement, and public order. Lawlessness begets lawlessness, and in recent weeks we\u2019ve seen reports of vigilantes and far-right activists joining the melee from Richmond to Philadelphia. Local officials are allowing this disorder to occur, and the more it is indulged the worse it is likely to get.Online: https://www.wsj.com/Copyright 2020 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Education reporter Valerie Strauss reports that the guidelines sent to Gov. Ron DeSantis (R), who has pushed for schools to reopen fully, list measures schools should take to safely offer in-person learning, including: Staggering start times for students to keep the number of children low inside classrooms. Keeping kids in cohorts throughout the school day. Enforcing strict handwashing requirements; disinfecting classroom surfaces every day. Ensuring that ventilation systems for classrooms are in good working order. Keeping children and teachers six feet apart in classrooms and during outdoor activities. Barring any activities in which students face each other.\u201cIn the absence of robust and rapid diagnostic testing for schools, the major tools for disease mitigation are personal (social) distancing, mask usage, strict hand hygiene, fomite prevention on surfaces (enhanced cleaning measures), and proper room ventilation,\" says the guidance, submitted by Paul Robinson, the chapter\u2019s president.\u00a0(Read his full 11-page letter here.)At least 17 of 21 states flagged as \u201cred zones\u201d in the latest internal report compiled for the White House coronavirus task force are apparently not following recommendations by federal authorities to slow the spread.\u00a0\u201cThe report, which is sent regularly to state officials but is not released to the public, categorizes states as green, yellow or red based on their levels of new cases and rate of tests coming back positive,\u201d Hannah Knowles reports. \u201cA state is designated a red zone if it reports more than 100 new cases per 100,000 people or if more than 10 percent of its virus tests come back positive.\u201dADADRep.

This proposed group would also include older adults, residents of long-term-care facilities and people with underlying medical conditions. A federal advisory panel that provides vaccine recommendations to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention presented an overview of the priority groups last month and met again Wednesday to discuss the issue. \u2026 U.S. officials have said that if a vaccine is shown to be effective, the first doses could be available by the end of the year. \u2026\u00a0ADAD\u201cThe overview of proposed priority groups laid out by the federal advisory panel includes subsets within those that should get the highest consideration.

Subscribe today.arrow-rightThe phenomenon, unfolding largely on social media, escalated this week when President Donald Trump retweeted a false video about an anti-malaria drug being a cure for the virus and it was revealed that Russian intelligence is spreading disinformation about the crisis through English-language websites.Experts worry the torrent of bad information is dangerously undermining efforts to slow the virus, whose death toll in the U.S. hit 150,000 Wednesday, by far the highest in the world, according to the tally kept by Johns Hopkins University. Over a half-million people have died in the rest of the world.ADADHard-hit Florida reported 216 deaths, breaking the single-day record it set a day earlier. Texas confirmed 313 additional deaths, pushing its total to 6,190, while South Carolina\u2019s death toll passed 1,500 this week, more than doubling over the past month.

The member, Texas Rep. Louie Gohmert, often shunned wearing masks and was known to vote without one.Pelosi announced Wednesday evening that all members will be required to wear a mask when voting on the House floor and that one will be provided if anyone forgets. Several hours later, the House sergeant-at-arms and the Capitol\u2019s top physician issued an order requiring masks inside House office buildings, with few exceptions. That mandate goes into effect at 8 a.m. Thursday.ADPelosi said failure to wear a mask on the House floor is a \u201cserious breach of decorum\u201d for which members could be removed from the chamber. Members will be able to temporarily remove them while speaking, however. In the House office buildings, people can remove them to eat, drink and give interviews, among a few other specific situations.AD\u201cIt\u2019s a sign of respect for the health, safety and well-being of others present in the chamber and in surrounding areas,\u201d Pelosi said.Gohmert tested positive just before he was scheduled to travel to his home state with President Donald Trump.

That would be more than triple the previous worst quarterly economic fall, a 10% drop set in 1958. Depressed activity in such areas as business investment, home construction and government spending also likely contributed to the worst quarterly contraction on records dating to 1947.ADADOn Thursday, the government will issue its first of three estimates of economic activity, as measured by the gross domestic product, for the April-June quarter.So dizzying was the contraction last quarter that most analysts expect the economy to manage a sharp bounce-back in the current July-September quarter, perhaps of as much as 17% or higher on an annual basis. Yet with the rate of confirmed coronavirus cases now rising in a majority of states, more businesses being forced to pull back on re-openings and the Republican Senate proposing to scale back the government\u2019s aid to the unemployed, the economy could worsen in the months ahead.The Trump administration is betting against that outcome in asserting that the economy will undergo a V-shaped recovery in which last quarter\u2019s plunge would be followed by an impressive rebound in the current quarter \u2014 a hoped-for dose of good news that would be reported in late October, not long before Election Day.ADAD___4 Big Tech CEOs take congressional heat on competitionWASHINGTON \u2014 Fending off accusations of stifling competition, four Big Tech CEOs \u2014 Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg, Amazon\u2019s Jeff Bezos, Sundar Pichai of Google and Tim Cook of Apple \u2014 are answering for their companies\u2019 practices before Congress as a House panel caps its yearlong investigation of market dominance in the industry.The powerful CEOs sought to defend their companies amid intense grilling by lawmakers on Wednesday.The executives provided bursts of data showing how competitive their markets are, and the value of their innovation and essential services to consumers. But they sometimes struggled to answer pointed questions about their business practices. They also confronted a range of other concerns about alleged political bias, their effect on U.S. democracy and their role in China.ADADThe four CEOs were testifying remotely to lawmakers, most of whom were sitting, in masks, inside the hearing room in Washington.Among the toughest questions for Google and Amazon involved accusations that they used their dominant platforms to scoop up data about competitors in a way that gave them an unfair advantage.___Trump downplays West Texas energy worries, attacks DemocratsMIDLAND, Texas \u2014 President Donald Trump took sweeping digs at \u201ccrazy left radical Democrats\u201d on a trip Wednesday to the fracking fields of West Texas, launching unsubstantiated claims that a Democratic administration would destroy everything from the country\u2019s suburbs to the U.S. energy industry.Trump, speaking in front of stacked oil barrels, also played down the difficulties of the U.S. oil and gas industry, which is still struggling with the pandemic economic downturn and global oversupply that briefly drove oil prices into negative territory this spring. Prices have rebounded to around $40 a barrel, still below what some producers here need to break even.AD\u201cWe\u2019re OK now. We\u2019re back, we\u2019re back,\u201d Trump said to a crowd scattered with people wearing cowboy hats and face masks. He sought to contrast his support for oil and gas with Democratic rival Joe Biden\u2019s more climate-friendly energy plan, though Biden himself has stopped short of calling for a ban on hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, the production method that spurred U.S. oil and gas to a yearslong boom that started under President Barack Obama.\u201cIf they got in, you would have no more energy coming out of the great state of Texas,\u2019\u2019 warned Trump, whose poll numbers for the 2020 election are lagging. He claimed the same, without evidence, for Ohio and Pennsylvania, two fracking states that also are battlegrounds in the presidential race.Speaking under a tent on a hot, windy day, Trump alluded to the opposing party in the most extreme terms, saying a Democratic White House win and the policies of the \u201cWashington crazy left radical Democrats\u201d would mean \u201cthe death of American prosperity. It would destroy our country.\u201d___Senator, union leader: Postal Service considers downsizingCHARLESTON, W.Va. \u2014 The U.S. Postal Service is considering closing post offices across the country, sparking concerns ahead of an anticipated surge of mail-in ballots in the 2020 elections, U.S. Sen Joe Manchin and a union leader said Wednesday.Manchin said he has received numerous reports from post offices and colleagues about service cuts or looming closures in West Virginia and elsewhere, prompting him to send a letter  to Postmaster General Louis DeJoy asking for an explanation.The possible cutbacks come as DeJoy, a major donor to President Donald Trump who took control of the agency last month, moves to eliminate overtime for hundreds of thousands of postal workers, potentially causing a delay in mail deliveries. A recent document from the Postal Service, obtained by The Associated Press, described the need for an \u201coperational pivot\u201d to make the cash-strapped agency financially stable.\u201cIt\u2019s just asinine to think that you can shut something down or throttle it back in terms of the pandemic when basically the lifeline for voting and democracy is going to be in the hands of the Postal Service,\u201d Manchin, a Democrat, told reporters Wednesday.He said at least two post offices in West Virginia had been scheduled to close next month but that the agency had \u201cslowed\u201d its plans.___Census head wasn\u2019t told about Trump district drawing orderU.S. Census Bureau Director Steven Dillingham testified Wednesday that he wasn\u2019t informed ahead of time about President Donald Trump\u2019s order seeking to exclude people in the U.S. illegally from the process of redrawing congressional districts.Dillingham testified during an emergency congressional hearing that he was unaware of anyone from the Census Bureau playing a role in the order that civil rights groups have called unconstitutional. The bureau is collecting the head count data that will be used to redraw the districts.The Democratic-controlled House Committee on Oversight and Reform held the hearing after Trump issued a memorandum last week seeking to exclude people in the country illegally from being included during the district redrawing process. Civil rights group have filed multiple lawsuits challenging the memorandum as unconstitutional and an attempt to limit the power of Latinos and immigrants of color.Democratic lawmakers expressed both dismay and sympathy with Dillingham, a Trump appointee, for being kept out of the loop on such a vital decision involving the bureau.Opponents of Trump\u2019s order say it could discourage immigrants and noncitizens from participating in the once-a-decade head count used for deciding how many congressional seats each states gets in a process known as apportionment. A Pew Research Center analysis shows that the order, if it stands up to challenges, could cost California, Florida and Texas congressional seats.___Malik B, founding member of The Roots, has died at 47LOS ANGELES \u2014 Malik B, a rapper and founding member of The Roots, has died.

It will take the spacecraft seven months to reach Mars after traveling 300 million miles.Once on the surface, Perseverance will scrounge for evidence of past microscopic life in an ancient lakebed, and gather the most promising rock samples for future pickup. NASA is teaming up with the European Space Agency to return the samples to Earth around 2031.This unprecedented effort will involve multiple launches and spacecraft \u2014 and cost more than $8 billion.\u201cWe don\u2019t know if life existed there or not.

Subscribe today.arrow-rightWASHINGTON \u2014 As Congress and the White House resume their efforts to agree on a new economic aid package, evidence is growing that the U.S. economy is faltering. And so is concern that the government may not take the steps needed to support hiring and growth. With unemployment still at a high 11.1% and hiring potentially slowing in July, the economy is likely to weaken further without more government aid, economists say. What\u2019s needed, most economists say, is continued extra aid for tens of millions of unemployed Americans, along with more funding for state and local governments and more grants for struggling small companies, many of which could go out of business.AD___Gold\u2019s luster grows as investors hedge in uncertain timesNEW YORK \u2014 Wall Street is in the throes of a gold rush, as investors drive the price of the precious metal to new heights. The price of gold has climbed nearly 27% this year, more than double the return of the largest U.S. bond funds and towering over the roughly 1% return of big U.S. stocks. The biggest reason for the surge is fear surrounding the pandemic. No one knows how many people the new virus will ultimately kill \u2014 or how much of the world\u2019s economy it will destroy. That sways investors toward the metal that has long been considered a safe haven for wealth in turbulent times.ADAD___Trade, technology and security at risk in US-China feudBEIJING \u2014 They have the largest economies in the world. They spend more than anyone else on their militaries. From high-tech chips to control of the high seas, their interests are closely intertwined. The ongoing sharp deterioration in U.S.-China ties poses risks to both countries and the rest of the world. In the latest escalation, a U.S. consulate in Chengdu in southwestern China shuttered Monday, ordered by China to close in retaliation for the U.S. shutting down its consulate in Houston last week. With the U.S. presidential campaign heating up, all bets are that relations with China will only get worse. At stake are global trade, technology and security. ___ADGarmin acknowledges cyberattack, doesn\u2019t mention ransomwareBOSTON \u2014 Garmin has acknowledged being victimized by a cyberattack that encrypted some of its systems, knocking its fitness tracking and pilot navigation services offline last week. It said systems would be fully restored in the next few days. The company did not specify that ransomware was to blame. But a person familiar with the incident response told The Associated Press that attackers had turned over decryption keys that would allow Garmin to unlock the data scrambled in the attack. Garmin had no comment on ransom the company may have paid.AD___Wall Street returns to rallying; gold jumps to record highADNEW YORK \u2014 Stocks resumed their upward march on Wall Street Monday, while the price of gold rushed to a record high at the start of a week packed with potentially market-moving events. The S&P 500 rose 0.7% following mixed, modest moves in overseas markets. This week\u2019s headline event may be a two-day meeting for the Federal Reserve on interest rates that begins Tuesday. It\u2019s also a heavy week for earnings reports, and Congress is debating more aid for the economy. Nervousness is still hanging over markets, which helped gold briefly shoot above $1,940 per ounce for the first time.___Google to keep most of its employees at home until July 2021SAN RAMON, Calif. \u2014 Google has decided that most of its 200,000 employees and contractors should work from home through next June. It\u2019s a sobering assessment of the pandemic\u2019s potential staying power from the company that provides the answers for the world\u2019s most trusted internet search engine. The remote-work order issued Monday by Google CEO Sundar Pichai also affects other companies owned by Google\u2019s corporate parent, Alphabet Inc. It marks a six-month extension of Google\u2019s previous plan to keep most of its offices closed through the rest of this year. The prolonged lockdown of Google\u2019s offices could influence other major employers to take similar precautions.ADAD___Target joins Walmart in ending Thanksgiving store shoppingNEW YORK \u2014 Target is joining Walmart in closing its stores on Thanksgiving Day, ending a decadelong tradition of jump-starting Black Friday sales. The move, announced Monday, comes as stores are rethinking the Black Friday in-store door busters as they try to curb the spread of the coronavirus, which has seen a resurgence in a slew of states. Target opened for the first time on Thanksgiving in 2011, joining other stores in launching Black Friday sales a day early and creating a new tradition of shoppers heading out to the stores after their turkey feast. The bigger question still looms on how to handle Black Friday itself this year, which also draws huge crowds \u2014 and sales.AD___The S&P 500 climbed 23.78 points, or 0.7%to 3,239.41.

But in an executive order signed in May, President Trump gave DFC new powers under the Defense Production Act to finance domestic health-care manufacturing needed to respond to the coronavirus crisis.ADShortages of face masks and other protective equipment for doctors and nurses have raised concerns in recent months about U.S. reliance on China and India for pharmaceutical ingredients and finished medicines. About 40 percent of the world\u2019s supply of drug ingredients is used to produce generic medicines for Americans, but only 10 percent these materials are manufactured in the United States, according to DFC.The aim is \u201cto re-shore critical industries so if we ever end up in a situation like this again we are not relying on China or others,\u201d DFC chief executive Adam Boehler said in an interview.AD\u201cIt\u2019s a breakthrough in bringing pharmaceutical manufacturing back to the United States,\u201d Trump said of the deal during a coronavirus briefing, calling it his administration\u2019s 33rd use of the Defense Production Act.ADBoehler signed a preliminary agreement with Kodak Executive Chairman Jim Continenza on Tuesday to provide the loan, which is still subject to final DFC due diligence, a Kodak spokeswoman said.In an interview, Continenza said Kodak has more than 130 years of experience manufacturing chemicals, which the company has used to make film and other products. \u201cWe are truly doing this to help tighten and fix the supply chain of pharmaceuticals in America,\u201d Continenza said, adding that U.S. reliance on imported ingredients is worrying. \u201cI have kids, and they\u2019re going to have kids. \u2026 We cannot have this,\u201d he said.Trump takes a first step toward returning medical supply chains to the U.S.Kodak plans to produce two types of chemicals used to make pills and tablets: the initial building blocks, known as key starting materials and more refined substances called active pharmaceutical ingredients, known as API.ADADIn recent years, Kodak has been making key starting materials for a few pharmaceutical companies upon request, Continenza said. Kodak plans to repurpose and expand some of its manufacturing lines to carry out the work, he said.Susan Capie, managing director of PharmaVantage, a consultancy in Babylon, N.Y., said she sees several challenges.When drug companies ask the Food and Drug Administration for permission to sell a new medicine in the United States, they must specify which API suppliers they plan to use. It can take 10 months or more for the FDA to approve a new supplier, meaning Kodak might not have immediate API buyers, she said.Kodak also will face tough price competition from overseas suppliers, she said, although she added that tougher environmental regulation in China in recent years has driven up prices there. U.S. companies might prefer to deal with a domestic supplier, but it \u201cwould depend on the price differential,\u201d she said.ADADContinenza said Kodak would provide \u201cthe highest value for the lowest cost.\u201dPeter Navarro, a White House adviser who has long pushed to boost manufacturing in the United States, was involved in the Kodak deal and attended the signing ceremony on Tuesday.In an interview, Navarro said the federal government will help bolster Kodak\u2019s business by buying some API for a strategic stockpile. Navarro and Boehler also said some drug companies plan to sign advance purchase orders for Kodak\u2019s ingredients.Kodak founder George Eastman began selling some of the first cameras to consumers in 1888, but the switch to digital and then smartphone cameras left the company in the lurch, forcing it to file for bankruptcy in 2012. It later emerged from bankruptcy and tried to focus on a few businesses, including printing machines and specialty film for motion pictures and other industries.ADADKodak\u2019s stock more than tripled after news of the deal broke Tuesday.Deputy Defense Secretary David Norquist also attended the signing ceremony. Because DFC is lending the money under the Defense Production Act, the Defense Department bears the cost of the loan, DFC said.DFC said it has invited other companies to apply for financing under the Defense Production Act for projects supporting domestic production of drugs, personal protective equipment and other medical supplies such as vaccines or virus testing materials.", "comment": "0 Comments", "topic": "Business"}, {"cover": "", "title": "Amid the pandemic, Big Tech reports mixed earnings", "date": "Jul 30, 2020", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/technology/big-tech-hit-by-the-pandemic-reports-mixed-earnings/2020/07/30/7f5481ca-d2a3-11ea-826b-cc394d824e35_story.html", "keyword": "China and the world order", "website": "the Washington Post", "author": "", "content": "Big Tech companies reported mixed quarterly earnings on Thursday, a day after their top executives faced a tough congressional grilling over their market power and alleged monopolistic practices.All four were affected by the pandemic, although in strikingly different ways.

Subscribe today.arrow-rightShares of all four companies rose in after-hours trading, reflecting financial performance that exceeded Wall Street expectations.Alphabet, Google\u2019s holding company, reported its first-ever drop in quarterly revenue compared to the prior year. Although it was only a 2% decline, it was a telling sign of a major downturn in the digital ad market \u2014 and of the fact that the economy is in even worse shape than it was a decade ago during the Great Recession.ADADGoogle\u2019s previous low point came during the second quarter of 2009 when its revenue edged up by just 3%. Alphabet\u2019s profit for its most recent quarter plunged 30% to nearly $7 billion.Revenue from Google\u2019s core search business declined nearly 10%, though Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat said there were signs of improvement at the end of the quarter as internet users searched for more commercial products and advertisers began spending more on the platform. Still, she said, it\u2019s \u201cpremature to gauge the durability\u201d of those trends because of ongoing economic uncertainty around the world.Facebook, which also makes most of its money from digital ads, recorded an 11% increase in revenue from the prior year, the company\u2019s slowest growth since going public eight years ago. Profit nearly doubled to $5.2 billion from the same time last year, although it would have fallen if not for $3 billion in tax and legal expense items a year ago, much of that related to a a major antitrust settlement with the Federal Trade Commission.ADADThe average number of people who use Facebook, Instagram, Messenger or WhatsApp \u2014 all of which Facebook owns \u2014 at least once a month climbed 14% to 3.1 billion. That\u2019s roughly 40% of the world\u2019s population. And 2.5 billion people used at least one of its apps every day. Facebook said pandemic-related shutdowns drove more people to its services.The social network said it expects ad revenue to grow about 10% in the current quarter, similar to the second quarter. While that\u2019s more than analysts expect, it factors in issues including economic uncertainty, less time spent on its apps as the world reopens from the pandemic in many places, the impact of a July ad boycott targeting hate speech and regulations affecting its business like California\u2019s new privacy law.The advertising industry has been hit by a pullback in spending from the travel industry, retailers and other buyers, contributing to what research group Forrester predicts will be a 29% decline in U.S. advertising spending this year. But Google and Facebook are likely to help lead a relatively quick rebound as the pandemic accelerates the shift to shopping online, given that the tech companies are able to precisely target ads to specific audiences, said Forrester analyst Jay Pattisall.ADADApple delivered surprisingly strong results with rising revenue and profit, defying analysts\u2019 lowered expectations. The iPhone maker\u2019s revenue rose 11% to nearly $60 billion while profit rose 12% to $11.3 billion.The pandemic initially walloped Apple twice: First by temporarily shutting down iPhone production while the coronavirus ravaged China, then by hitting household incomes, making its high-end gadgets less affordable. It softened the blow with the mid-April release of a budget iPhone selling for almost $400, helping the company boost its sales of its biggest moneymaker by 2% from last year.But the next iPhone will be delayed. Apple CFO Luca Maestri told analysts on a conference call that pandemic-related issues will push back the release a \u201cfew weeks later\u201d than Apple\u2019s typical late September window, meaning consumers aren\u2019t likely to see the phones until October at the earliest.ADADIn another expression of confidence, Apple announced a four-for-one stock split. While the move doesn\u2019t affect the company\u2019s intrinsic value, it will make individual Apple shares more affordable \u2014 although such moves often also fuel investor demand that can drive share prices higher. Apple\u2019s stock has already risen roughly 50% since the start of the pandemic.People shopped more on Amazon during the pandemic, sending its profit and revenue to record highs, even as the company spent more to speed up deliveries and keep its workers safe.Amazon struggled to keep up with orders as online shopping surged in the spring amid widespread lockdowns. But the company has since hired an additional 175,000 people to keep up with orders and began paying its warehouse workers bonuses to keep them packing boxes during the pandemic.ADADAmazon said it spent more than $4 billion on COVID-19 related costs, including disinfecting its warehouses and protective gear for workers. It expects those costs to fall to $2 billion in the third quarter. The Seattle-based company said its second-quarter profit doubled to $5.2 billion from last year while revenue soared 40% to $88.9 billion.Amazon, which is the second-largest U.S. employer after Walmart, also said Thursday that its employee count topped 1 million for the first time.___This article has been corrected to note Alphabet\u2019s most recent quarterly profit, which was nearly $7 billion, and to note that Apple plans a four-for-one stock split.Copyright 2020 The Associated Press.

Subscribe today.arrow-rightJuly 21The Washington Post on the recent hacking of several high-profile Twitter accounts:\u201cTough day for us at Twitter,\u201d company chief executive Jack Dorsey tweeted last Wednesday, after several high-profile accounts on his site were hacked. This was an understatement.The security breach the social media network experienced last week was alarming not only for what happened but also for what could have happened. Accounts from Warren Buffett to Kanye West to Joe Biden promised to double money sent to a Bitcoin address. \u201cI am giving back to my community due to covid-19!\u201d former president Barack Obama, another victim, appeared to declare.ADThe perpetrator made off with about $118,000. But imagine trusted accounts hijacked to share false news of a massive terror attack and unleash financial meltdown \u2014 or imagine them taken over on Election Day to give voters false information about polling places.ADThese worse-case scenarios point to the risks when public and even government figures carry out essential functions on a single private platform. The mishap should teach elected officials not to rely exclusively on Twitter or Facebook or anything else to communicate with constituents. But it should also teach platforms to adopt smarter cybersecurity practices.Twitter hasn\u2019t yet provided a full post-mortem, but a blog post from the company combined with reporting from multiple outlets offers a peek: A hacker lurking on a forum generally used for stealing and then selling credentials to accounts with coveted short-character screen names (often an individual letter or number such as @6 or @y) boasted that he had access to Twitter\u2019s internal controls.ADHe gained these through \u201csocial engineering\u201d \u2014 which could mean phishing of employees or bribery or even an insider-initiated attack. Once he had done so, he could bypass all the safeguards people are always being told are essential to responsible security.ADOf course, these safeguards are still essential. But companies such as Twitter must also take steps to ensure the integrity of their platforms, primarily when it comes to administrative tools employees use to touch the most sensitive information. Sites should require more sources of authentication for getting into those systems; a password alone shouldn\u2019t be enough.They should also scale back the number of workers who can use the systems, and institute robust monitoring programs that alert them when something suspicious is happening behind the scenes. And they ought to consider implementing special protection programs for sensitive accounts of the precise type that were compromised last week.ADThe FBI is investigating what happened, and lawmakers have asked for information. Twitter has promised a fuller explanation to the public of what went wrong. It should deliver that \u2014 along with an explanation of how it means to ensure things don\u2019t go wrong again.ADOnline: https://www.washingtonpost.com/___July 21The Dallas Morning News on the death of U.S. Congressman John Lewis:Right now, America needs heroes. And we have one for the ages in John Lewis.His life of sacrifice in the name of the larger principles of freedom and equality and his career of service to his country are emblems of the better America we hope to be and the better America we can become.ADIn remembering him, we should remember that the struggle for equality is an enduring human struggle, that it will not come cheaply nor easily, that the path can be dangerous and the pain very real, and that it will almost certainly never be over.We can remember too, though, that it can be rewarded \u2014 that things can get better \u2014 and that Lewis\u2019 sacrifice, along with those of the Freedom Riders and so many advocates for reform, bequeathed to us a better nation, where we more fully, if still imperfectly, embrace the individual dignity of each American and extend in law the protection of their basic human rights.ADLewis, who died at 80 Friday, had his skull cracked with a billy club as a young man to help bring us to this place where we are. And even as violence was done upon him, he rejected violence in return. The undeniable moral authority that he carried on the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Ala., in 1965 was the authority that finally mattered.ADIn considering his legacy, we must also consider the work that remains. Poverty, imprisonment and other legacies of slavery and codified racism still track our country. Lewis supported the marches in opposition of police violence against Black Americans and considered them an extension of his work as a young man.We also hope, as we memorialize his life and all he did as a protester, organizer and congressman, that we don\u2019t fail to recognize the truth that his work mattered because it made a real difference in our country and in improving the lives of Black Americans. The America that John Lewis died in is not the same America he was born into as the child of sharecroppers. It is not the same America that disenfranchised Black Americans as a matter of law denied them basic human rights.ADIt is an America that took his search for justice and equality seriously, that cared his body was beaten and his skull fractured, that rejected the forces of inequality, segregation and racism.ADThat better America is an America we must work toward every day. The struggle is renewed over and over in each of us as individuals and in all of us as a society.John Lewis has died. But in a good and ever better America, John Lewis will live forever.Online: https://www.dallasnews.com/___July 21The Wall Street Journal on charges brought against a Missouri couple for displaying guns at protesters during a demonstration outside their mansion:By now all America knows Mark and Patricia McCloskey from the video showing the St. Louis couple holding legal firearms as they defended themselves and their home from a crowd of protesters trespassing on their property. A politically motivated prosecutor on Monday charged the couple with unlawful use of a weapon.ADADThe felony count is because they pointed their weapons at protesters. Mr. McCloskey said he did so because he was \u201cscared for my life,\u201d and that of his wife. No shots were fired. Yet now prosecutor Kim Gardner is charging them on grounds they made the trespassers fear for their safety.The good news is that there\u2019s been plenty of official blowback. Missouri Gov. Mike Parson tweeted that \u201cWe will not allow law-abiding citizens to be targeted for exercising their constitutional rights.\u201d He has promised a pardon if they\u2019re convicted.Attorney General Eric Schmitt is working to get the case dismissed, noting that, in addition to the U.S. and Missouri constitutions, Missouri law recognizes the \u201ccastle doctrine.\u201d This allows residents to use force against intruders, including deadly force, based on self-defense and the notion that your home is your castle.ADADMs. Gardner contends that those who surrounded the McCloskeys were \u201cpeaceful, unarmed protesters,\u201d and the couple were therefore interfering in the crowd\u2019s First Amendment rights. It doesn\u2019t seem to have occurred to Ms. Gardner that the guns they carried may be a reason events didn\u2019t turn violent. \u201cI really thought it was Storming the Bastille, that we would be dead and the house would be burned and there was nothing we could do about it,\u201d Mr. McCloskey told KSDK in an interview.Even if the charges are dismissed, or the McCloskeys are pardoned after being convicted, again we have a public official responsible for upholding law and order wink at a mob while treating law-abiding citizens as criminals. If police cannot be counted on to deal with mobs, it\u2019s even more vital that law-abiding Americans are free to exercise their Second Amendment right to protect themselves.Online: https://www.wsj.com/AD___July 20The Los Angeles Times on President Donald Trump sending federal law enforcement officers to Portland, Oregon:The deployment of federal agents in Portland, Ore., over the objection of state and local officials, to shoot and gas protesters and to snatch people from the street to stuff them into unmarked vans is an unconscionable assault on democracy and a dangerous and needless ratcheting up of tension.President Trump\u2019s action in defiance of Oregon\u2019s governor and Portland\u2019s mayor has predictably given new life to nonstop protests that began after the May 25 death of George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody but at last had begun to peter out. The president has thus employed his wretched talent for exacerbating division and inflaming discord at precisely the time the nation needs a leader to calm overheated passions and fears.Presidents have broad power to deploy troops to quell lawlessness, but they generally exercise that power only when governors request assistance, or when the commander-in-chief himself determines that state authorities are failing to deal with the problem.They send in federal forces to protect people or to enforce the Constitution, as when President Eisenhower sent troops to Little Rock, Ark., in 1957 to enforce the right of Black students to enroll in a previously all-white high school and to make clear that the famous Supreme Court ruling in Brown vs. Board of Education would be enforced, that the doctrine of \u201cseparate but equal\u201d had been overturned, and that state segregationists could not defy the basic American principle that all people are equal under law.Trump, by contrast, directed federal agencies to use their muscle to protect statues, monuments and other federal properties, not people or the Constitution. And he said Monday that he plans to do this in more cities \u2014 evidently, because he thinks displaying force against the citizenry is going to help him in November.This has become part of his pattern. In the weeks before overreacting to the Portland protests, Trump used troops to clear his path for a photo op near the White House. He set forth his doctrine that \u201cwhen the looting starts, the shooting starts.\u201d He articulated his principle that states should \u201cdominate the streets,\u201d and if they didn\u2019t, that he would override their authority.It is a fact that some individuals have used the protests in Portland as an opportunity to destroy property and inject chaos into the demonstrations. It fell to Portland leaders to strike the proper balance. They could respond with force, and thus play into protesters\u2019 hands by presenting police engaged in precisely the kind of actions that were being protested; or they could monitor the situation, give protesters the room to make their case, tolerate some property losses and allow the demonstrations to die down on their own.They made their choices, and they may well have made some bad ones. Portland has been on edge for weeks. But Mayor Ted Wheeler is the person answerable to the city\u2019s people. He did not need, and did not seek, federal backup.Trump\u2019s insistence on federalizing the situation on his own undermines Portlanders\u2019 control of their own city, and exacerbates the violence far more than the protesters\u2019 actions did.The president has in effect equated people protesting police brutality with terrorists, and is treating them as such.In October, before Trump\u2019s impeachment, before the COVID-19 pandemic, before the death of Floyd and before the nationwide protests, the president signed an order creating a Commission on Law Enforcement and the Administration of Justice. As with so many steps Trump takes, this one appeared to be geared directly toward undoing an action of the Obama administration, in this case the creation of the 2015 President\u2019s Task Force on 21st Century Policing.The Obama task force delved into police brutality, racial disparities in arrests and prosecutions, and other challenges facing modern-day policing in the U.S. Its recommendations included enhancing civilian oversight, improving training and building trust and legitimacy. Many of its efforts were rolled back by the Trump administration.In launching Trump\u2019s commission, Atty. Gen. William Barr included as a central question something that apparently baffles him as well as the president: Why is there a \u201ccontinued lack of trust and respect for law enforcement\u201d in many communities?The answer is right under their noses. It is spread out on the street with George Floyd, it is shoved alongside protesters into unmarked federal police vans, it stands agog, with many of us, at actions to protect statues but shoot projectiles at people. The president won\u2019t look. He sees what he sees, with eyes that won\u2019t open.Online: https://www.latimes.com___July 18The South China Morning Post on tensions between the United States and China:The risk of military conflict in the South China Sea between China and the United States is high and tensions are rising. In the midst of the Covid-19 crisis, amid discord on a wide range of issues and shortly after both held naval exercises in the area at the same time, American Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has raised the stakes to even more worrying levels by ending his country\u2019s silence on territorial disputes in the contested waters.His siding with Southeast Asian nations over Beijing was to be expected, as was the foreign ministry\u2019s angry response, but weighing in on so sensitive a row is a further unnecessary provocation that puts the rivals and their allies on a dangerous course. With relations arguably at their worst and seemingly spiraling out of control, there is every need for a diplomatic solution, no matter how remote that may appear.Beijing has wasted no time in assuring Southeast Asian countries, with President Xi Jinping phoning the leaders of Singapore and Thailand and Foreign Minister Wang Yi contacting his Philippine counterpart. Washington\u2019s refraining from commenting on the South China Sea issue had made a peaceful agreement between China and its neighbors on the various sovereignty claims more possible. Increasingly frequent sailings of US warships through the contested waters were voiced in terms of ensuring freedom of navigation in the busy shipping lanes.But Pompeo discarded the US\u2019 position last week, describing Beijing\u2019s claims to parts of the resource-rich seas as \u201ccompletely unlawful\u201d, aligning for the first time with a 2016 tribunal ruling by the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, which has not been acceded to by the US. Neither side is blameless, but US President Donald Trump\u2019s administration has taken an increasingly antagonistic approach towards China on a widening range of issues. It has blamed Beijing for the coronavirus pandemic, an unproven claim that is in the way of cooperation to develop a vaccine.The Sino-US relationship is among the most important in the world and talks improve understanding. A meeting in Hawaii last month between China\u2019s top diplomat, Yang Jiechi, and Pompeo, was an opportunity to explain positions and visualise limits.Wang recently laid out a strategy in which he proposed Chinese and American think tanks draw up three lists detailing areas of cooperation and discord so that disputes could be managed and their impact on relations minimised. Restraint is a sensible course and also a form of diplomacy. Pursuing the alternative makes no sense when the world\u2019s most pressing agenda should be fighting the coronavirus on two challenging fronts, health and livelihoods. Dialogue, not confrontation, is urgently needed to avoid crossing red lines.Online: https://www.scmp.com/___July 18The New York Times on expanding internet access for Americans amid the coronavirus pandemic:When Autumn Lee, a pre-med junior at the University of New Mexico, needs to download lectures or class assignments, she hops in her car and drives 45 minutes to the McDonald\u2019s nearest to her town of Sanders, Ariz., to connect to reliable Wi-Fi from her car. After the university sent students home because of the coronavirus pandemic, Ms. Lee grew frustrated with what she said is expensive and data-restricted internet service in Sanders, an unincorporated village of fewer than 1,000 people in eastern Arizona. Relying on her smartphone data plan wasn\u2019t much of an alternative.\u201cIt took one or two hours to watch a 20-minute lecture,\u201d she said. \u201cI just got so frustrated, I figured there had to be another way.\u201d So she made the 40-mile trek several times each week \u2014 and she\u2019ll likely have to keep doing it now that the school has canceled nearly all in-person classes for the fall.Like Ms. Lee, many other Americans sheltering from Covid-19 are discovering the limitations of the country\u2019s cobbled-together broadband service. Schooling, jobs, government services, medical care and child care that once were performed in person have been turned over to the web, exposing a deep rift between the broadband haves and have-nots.Those rifts are poised to turn into chasms, as the global pandemic threatens another year of in-person schooling for American children. Large public-school districts like Los Angeles and Prince George\u2019s County in Maryland, as well as a variety of colleges and universities, from Hampton to Harvard to Scripps, have canceled in-school instruction at the start of the coming year.Gov. Gavin Newsom on Friday announced rules that would require the vast majority of schools in California to begin the year remotely, meaning millions of pupils will need a reliable internet connection throughout the day for instruction. Additional districts that are going online only at the start of the year include Nashville, Houston and Atlanta.Other districts will surely follow, as the raging contagion in their communities gives them little alternative. An adequate connection is no longer a matter of convenience; it is a necessity for anyone wishing to participate in civil society.Service is often unavailable or too expensive in rural communities and low-income neighborhoods. This has forced people into parking lots outside libraries, schools and coffee shops to find a reliable signal \u2014 while others are simply staying logged off. At the same time, there is pressure on small businesses that are still using pen and paper to modernize or face extinction.Yet, federal and local initiatives have failed to bring swift internet service to tens of millions of Americans. Like electricity, internet service has become a necessity for modern life.\u201cWhat Covid-19 has done is accelerate the pace of technological change,\u201d said Kathryn de Wit, manager of the Pew Charitable Trust\u2019s broadband research initiative. \u201cGetting online isn\u2019t an option anymore, and if you don\u2019t have that connection, you\u2019re pretty much cut off.\u201dEfforts to fix this inequity extend back at least as far as 2009, when Congress directed the Federal Communications Commission to develop a plan to get broadband service to nearly every American.Some 21 million still lack it, according to commissioners\u2019 estimates. Yet that might be an underestimate: One study puts it far higher, at around 42 million. The Pew Research Center said as many as one in four rural Americans lack high-speed internet service, because of either the cost or a lack of availability.Microsoft and others have disputed the F.C.C.\u2019s data, which relies on self-reporting from internet service providers \u2014 reporting that can indicate an entire census block has service even if service is provided to just one household within the area.Getting an accurate count of where broadband is needed is critical, because it helps federal programs like the Rural Digital Opportunity Fund determine where to spend to expand broadband\u2019s reach, meaning the Opportunity Fund\u2019s $20.4 billion in planned outlays over the next 10 years could still leave many Americans behind. Two of the F.C.C.\u2019s five commissioners dissented over parts of the funding, citing the faulty accounting.Two bills passed by the House last year would help improve how broadband\u2019s reach is counted. These bills are encouraging bipartisan steps toward addressing the problem.Also worthy of strong consideration is a bill introduced last month by Representative James Clyburn, Democrat of South Carolina. It was followed by a Senate version this month, that would devote $100 billion toward making broadband accessible in underserved areas. But Republicans have indicated that they are not likely to support it.In urban areas, the struggle to get reliable or affordable internet service disproportionately affects minorities.The cost of broadband makes it three times more likely that households without internet service can be found in urban, rather than rural, environments, according to John B. Horrigan of the Technology Policy Institute. Distance learning over Zoom may be a poor substitute for the real thing, but with school closings amid the coronavirus extending into the fall, students without home internet connections could slip further behind.To help bridge the gap, some school districts distributed Wi-Fi hot spots and laptops to needy students. Francine Hernandez drove to a Tucson, Ariz. parking lot with her 14-year-old daughter every day for nearly a month to access Wi-Fi beamed from yellow district school buses. She said the family had lost service after her husband lost his job, making this the best alternative.\u201cIt was the only way she could finish her homework,\u201d said Ms. Hernandez. She said she sat in the car with her daughter for three hours at a stretch until the buses left before lunch.Today, broadband is a patchwork of infrastructure and services offered primarily by major corporations like Verizon and AT&T. But swaths of the country have been left with no service, either because of a lack of perceived profits or a lack of the political will to extend fiber to harder-to-reach communities.Electrifying the entire country a century ago was made possible by a coordinated federal plan from the administration of Franklin D. Roosevelt The Rural Electrification Administration brought electricity to areas outside city centers through federal loans to small cooperatives formed to bring power lines and generators to their communities.While such a centralized effort may be unlikely today without the urgency of the New Deal, the coronavirus has demonstrated that it is time for the federal government to think more creatively and to act more swiftly to deploy broadband service.As service areas exist today, Geoff Wiggins cannot get broadband internet service extended to his house in Liberty Township, Ohio, near Columbus, even though he lives just a few houses in either direction from available service. He said a local provider told him he\u2019d have to pay more than $30,000 to get internet cable extended just to his driveway. So he has relied on wireless service from phone providers and weekend excursions to the parking lots of nearby businesses.Universal broadband will be costly, but shelter-in-place orders have demonstrated that it is even more costly to leave so many Americans behind. A House bill to accelerate deployment of the $20.4 billion overseen by the Rural Digital Opportunity Fund is a start, but the F.C.C. has estimated it could take $80 billion to reach nearly every American without broadband. House Democrats proposed in April that more than $80 billion be authorized over five years for broadband expansion.\u201cPeople are afraid of the price tag,\u201d said Mr. Clyburn, a co-sponsor of the bill along with Representative Fred Upton, Republican of Michigan. \u201cWe can\u2019t afford not to do it.\u201dPerhaps more daunting is the challenge of providing service that is speedy and at a price that even lower-income Americans can afford. One study found that poorer Americans can afford only $10 a month for internet service. But such service is typically at far slower speeds than what is available in more affluent neighborhoods, or for free at Starbucks.Private industry may have little desire to provide lower-tier broadband service when it can profit far more from higher-end services. The expansion of federal programs, like E-Rate, to allow schools to distribute broadband service directly to students could also help lower costs.But those solutions are not a fix to the broader problem. Drawing Wi-Fi from school buses and fast-food restaurants isn\u2019t a long-term solution.Online: https://www.nytimes.com/Copyright 2020 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Subscribe today.arrow-rightThe stock market took a dive after the Commerce Department reported the economy shrank by 9.5 percent in the second quarter, the biggest recorded decline since the government began keeping track 70 years ago. The government also reported jobless claims climbing again last week by 1.4\u00a0million, another sign the recovery is fizzling. GDP shrank at an annual rate of 32.9 percent, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis.The dismal statistics  underscored the fragility of any  economic recovery, as many states are reversing their attempts to reopen for business and have imposed new restrictions.ADADAt an evening news briefing, President Trump  tried to swat away the raft of bad news about the economy and the disease, which he referred to as the \u201cChina virus\u201d and compared to a plague.\u201cIt\u2019s China\u2019s fault,\u201d he said flatly.Trump noted a resurgence of the disease in  states that appeared to have vanquished covid-19 early, largely due to draconian restrictions, and suggested the praise was premature.\u201cGovernors that were extremely popular are not so popular anymore,\u201d he said. \u201cThey were held up as models to follow, and then they got it.\u201dBut in deflecting any blame for the spread of the virus he once predicted would miraculously vanish in days and now has killed nearly  150,000 Americans, Trump offered several misrepresentations.ADFor example, he said children were \u201cimmune\u201d to the disease and should return to school this fall. In fact, immunologists have said that while children under the age of 10 are unlikely to transmit the novel coronavirus, children older than 10 can spread it as easily as adults.ADTrump also predicted a rapid economic recovery from the precipitous drop in employment and consumer spending caused by the pandemic.\u201cI think next year\u2019s going to be an excellent year, maybe one of our best years ever from an economic standpoint,\u201d Trump said.Jerome H. Powell, the chair of the Federal Reserve,  said any recovery depends on whether Americans are willing to embrace behavior that can beat back the virus.AD\u201cThe path of the economy is going to depend, to a very high extent, on the course of the virus and on the measures we take to keep it in check,\u201d he said Wednesday. \u201cSocial distancing measures and a fast reopening of the economy actually go together. They\u2019re not in competition with each other.\u201dTrump also used the coronavirus briefing to attack mail-in voting, hours after his Republican allies joined Democrats to rebuff his suggestion to delay the Nov. 3 election.  Trump said he wants the election decided quickly, rather than drag on until millions of mail-in ballots are counted and determined to be legitimate.AD\u201cI don\u2019t want to see that take place in a week, after Nov. 3, or a month,\u201d he said. \u201cOr frankly,  with litigation and everything else that could happen, it could take years. Years. Or you never even know who won the election.\u201dADTrump sounded more muted than combative, as the death toll continued to mount and experts warned of the potential of economic collapse.Nationwide, 1,400 people infected with the coronavirus died Wednesday, the highest number since May. Several states, including Florida and California, reported record highs for deaths in a single day. More than 4.4 million cases have been reported in the United States, and nearly 150,000 people have died, according to The Washington Post tracker.Among the deaths Thursday was well-known businessman turned politician Herman Cain, who sought the Republican nomination for president in 2012. He had attended a June 20 rally for President Trump in Tulsa, where he was photographed maskless in a crowd of others who were also without masks, but it was not determined whether that is where he contracted the virus.ADADAmid mostly glum news, optimism was in short supply. Even though new infections have leveled off in some of the hardest hit states in the South, they are creeping up elsewhere, threatening to  surge.The trends prompted both administration insiders and public health experts to urge governments to act more aggressively.Deborah Birx, the coordinator of the White House coronavirus task force, said states and localities should mandate wearing masks in public.During an appearance on Fox News, Birx said there remains a \u201cvery serious pandemic\u201d in Southern states. Despite signs of improvement, she added, the situation is deteriorating elsewhere.\u201cSo now we see the virus, probably because of vacations and other reasons of travel, moving up into Kentucky, Tennessee, southern Ohio, Missouri, Iowa, Kansas, Nebraska,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd, of course, we continue to have problems across the coast \u2014 Washington, Oregon, California, Idaho and Utah, and now increases in Colorado.\u201dADADBirx called for mandatory measures that Trump and many Americans have resisted, considering them alarmist and an infringement on their liberties.\u201cWe believe if the governors and mayors of every locality right now would mandate masks for their communities and [if] every American would wear a mask and socially distance and not congregate in large settings where you can\u2019t socially distance or wear a mask, that we can really get control of this virus and drive down cases as Arizona has done,\u201d Birx said.The Association of American Medical Colleges issued an ominous warning, along with a  \u201croad map\u201d of actions the country must take to avoid calamity.  AD\u201cIf the nation does not change its course \u2014 and soon \u2014 deaths in the United States could be well into the multiple hundreds of thousands,\u201d the organization said.ADThe Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security released a report Wednesday with 10 recommendations for action and another stark warning.\u201cUnlike many countries in the world, the United States is not currently on course to get control of this epidemic.

Clyburn (D-S.C.), the chairman of the House\u2019s Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis, which was formed to assess the Trump administration\u2019s response to the pandemic, wrote governors of several red-zone states urging them to heed experts\u2019 advice.The recent task force report \u201crecommends far stronger public health measures than the Trump Administration has called for in public \u2014 including requiring face masks, closing bars, and strictly limiting gatherings,\u201d Clyburn wrote in a letter to Birx and Vice President Pence. \u201cYet many states do not appear to be following these unpublished recommendations and are instead pursuing policies more consistent with the administration\u2019s contradictory public statements downplaying the seriousness of the threat.\u201dADOhio Gov.

Strict adherence to the plan allowed the country to claim victory over the virus this spring, stamping out clusters.ADADFaced with a resurgence that has similarly confounded Japan, Hong Kong and Australia, Vietnamese authorities are moving to contain a fresh cluster that has led to 36 new cases in the past week, for a total of 459 cases as of Thursday morning. Officials imposed strict quarantines on thousands of people who may have been exposed in the coastal city of Danang, reimposed stay-at-home measures and tightened border and immigration controls to prevent illegal entry.The government is now warning the virus could spread to other regions, including Ho Chi Minh City and the capital of Hanoi, where officials are suspending large gatherings and ordering bars to close.\u201cThe CDC has been working with us and helped us build up a plan that put in place steps to fight against pandemics,\u201d said Tran Dac Phu, senior adviser at the Public Health Emergency Operations Center under the nation\u2019s Ministry of Health. \u201cThe government is now very concerned about a second wave. We continue to work with the CDC and World Health Organization on this.\u201dADADKey to the government\u2019s success so far has been its ability to move quickly to test patients, isolate those who are sick, aggressively trace contacts and quarantine for 14 days those who come in contact with positive cases. It has also been essential to have consistent and transparent communication with the public, said Dr. Matthew Moore, director of the CDC\u2019s Global Health Security Program in Vietnam.The agency, which has been in Vietnam for 20 years and has a staff of 58 in the country including eight Americans, works with the government on testing protocols, guidelines to prevent transmission in health-care settings and training in epidemiology.\u201cTime and time again they have shut down chains of transmission,\u201d he said.ADLaser-Like FocusVietnam, a country whose 96 million citizens had a gross domestic product per capita of $2,715 last year, has been able to control the outbreak because of the government\u2019s laser-like anti-virus focus, a one-party political system and a population that didn\u2019t need convincing as a result of past disease outbreaks. The U.S., with a gross domestic product per capita of $65,280 in 2019, has not.ADVietnam\u2019s success has been globally lauded. The U.S., meanwhile, has surpassed 4.4 million cases and 150,000 deaths while President Donald Trump has consistently downplayed the spread of the virus. Rather than following the advice of the experts, in July he retweeted a post claiming the CDC was lying about the virus.ADThere have been dramatic differences between how Vietnam and U.S. approached the contagion crisis. Within weeks of Vietnam\u2019s first reported cases in late January, the government closed schools. The Trump administration continues to resist school shutdowns, and has even threatened to withhold federal funding from schools that don\u2019t bring back students.Hanoi quickly deploys tests to anyone suspected of exposure to the virus, while the U.S. continues to face testing shortcomings. Danang\u2019s authorities shut down three hospitals where victims visited and ordered patients, their caregivers, medical staff, and workers -- about 6,018 people in all -- to be quarantined for 14 days, according to the city\u2019s health department. Another 3,607 people have been isolated at centralized bases, health centers and homes.ADVietnam has some key advantages the U.S. doesn\u2019t in combating the virus. The Communist Party-controlled government dominates a society with a culture of collectivism, and its tough measures, like willingness to put in place lockdowns when needed, has been met with little resistance from the population.ADThis comes despite the fact that its quarantine regime is uncompromising and one of the strictest in the region. The government has placed Vietnamese and even foreigners seen at high risk of infection into isolation, sometimes at remote military camps.Still, an edge Vietnam has over the U.S. is the consistent message it has sent to the public about combating the virus, said Dr. Todd Pollack, an infectious disease specialist with the Harvard Medical School Partnership for Health Advancement in Vietnam.ADThe government\u2019s communications campaign includes posters in residential and office complexes, text messages, an app to help Vietnamese trace cases near them, regular updates on the Ministry of Health\u2019s website and even a pop song encouraging hand-washing and social distancing.ADPast EpidemicsHelping the country fight the virus has been the memory of past epidemics. The SARS outbreak in 2003 during killed five people in Vietnam and the bird flu led to 52 deaths in repeated outbreaks between 2004 and 2008. The country is also currently coping with a diphtheria outbreak that has caused three deaths, leading the government to isolate 700 people in a village in the coffee-growing Central Highlands province of Dak Lak.Vietnam\u2019s aggressive anti-virus measures have come at a cost: Almost 31 million workers have experienced job losses or pay cuts amid the restrictions. Vietnam\u2019s economy could grow 3% to 4% this year -- half the official target of 6.8%, according to a government advisory council.ADADMeanwhile, the government is getting pushback from some overseas-based companies as it strives to maintain its second-wave vigilance. Companies from South Korea, Vietnam\u2019s second-largest foreign investor, are pressuring the government to lift mandatory two-week quarantines of their workers traveling to Vietnam, local media outlet VnExpress reported.Yet the country\u2019s decisive actions may have burnished its reputation among companies seeking to diversify supply chains away from China. Some Japanese companies, with financial incentives from their government, are looking to relocate operations to Vietnam. Taiwanese company Inventec Corp., Apple Inc.\u2019s assembly partner for AirPods, is preparing to establish a unit in Vietnam and other suppliers of the Cupertino, California-based company may follow.Now the government\u2019s all-hands-on-deck counterattack is kicking in again.ADADHanoi authorities are testing 21,000 people flying back from Danang. The coastal city of Hoi An, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, has been placed on virtual lockdown. Meanwhile, the Health Ministry Thursday sent out an emergency bulletin listing more than two dozen potential virus \u201chotspots\u201d across the country, including a Danang supermarket, a Hanoi pizza restaurant and a Ho Chi Minh City mall.

Recent polls show about 70% of Japanese doubt the games will happen, or believe they should not happen.Here a quick look at what\u2019s going on:ADQ: What about Tokyo\u2019s worrisome summer heat? How has it been so far?A: Before the pandemic and the postponement, the major worry for organizers was Tokyo\u2019s stifling summer heat. The summer of 2019 was tough, but so far this summer has been mild and damp.ADTemperatures this first week have been in the 27-30 Celsius range \u2014 low 80sF \u2014 with some morning and evening showers, a few sunny afternoons, and no real heat although it\u2019s almost always humid.The forecast for next week looks nearly perfect with mild temperatures and more sunshine.The International Olympic Committee was so concerned about the heat that President Thomas Bach pressured Tokyo organizers last year to move the marathons and the race walks 800 kilometers (500 miles) north to Sapporo, which is also a leading candidate to land the 2030 Winter Olympics.ADThe move set off a public squabble between the IOC and Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike. It also cost millions.Q: We saw Japanese swim star Rikako Ikee last week in a brief ceremony at the new national stadium. What are her plans?A: Ikee was the star of the Asian Games two years ago, winning six gold medals in Jakarta. She was billed as Japan\u2019s \u201cGolden Girl\u201dand was sure to be the face of the Olympics. However, she was diagnosed with leukemia in 2019 and has undergone a year of difficult treatments. The 20-year-old Ikee says she hopes to compete in the 2024 Paris Olympics.ADHolding the Olympic flame in a tiny lantern, she gave an emotional speech last week at the new national stadium, which was empty for the 15-minute ceremony on July 23 to mark the one-year-to-go mark for the games. She symbolizes the struggles facing Tokyo 2020 as it tries to pull off an unprecedented postponement.AD\u201cLet this year that starts today not be just a delay, but instead be thought of as \u2018plus one\u2019 more year,\u201d Ikee said, speaking in Japanese. \u201cI feel that is a way of thinking that looks to the future and is optimistic. Of course, I understand well that there are some voices opposing even discussing sports when the world is in such a critical situation.\u201cBut on the other hand, I think that when crawling out of adversity, you certainly need the power of hope. As long as hope is glimmering far away, you can continue facing the future no matter how hard it gets.\u201dADQ: Where do the Paralympics stand?A: Olympians learned a few weeks ago that the competition schedule for next year\u2019s Olympics will be virtually the same as the one planned for this year. Paralympians are expected to get similar news on Monday.ADOrganizers say they have lined up the same 42 venues for the Olympics \u2014 and one extra one that is exclusively for the Paralympics.About 4,400 Paralympic athletes are expected, far fewer than the 11,000 Olympians expected. Plans call for athletes to be housed in the Athletes Village, a sprawling housing development on Tokyo Bay.Q: What are some of the scenarios that organizers are considering for next year?A: IOC vice president John Coates, who heads the inspection team for Tokyo, gave several interviews this week in Australia. He repeated what he said a few weeks ago in an on-line meeting with all IOC members. Everything is on the table.AD\u201cThere\u2019s obviously different scenarios under which the games might take place, depending where COVID-19 is,\u201d Coates told the Australian Associated Press.ADHe ran down some possibilities.\u201cOne scenario may be that COVID is gone,\u201d he said. \u201dA scenario might be COVID is under control in some countries but not in others among the 206 that send teams to the games. A scenario may be COVID is totally eradicated in Japan; or not eradicated in Japan.\u201dHe repeated what IOC President Thomas Bach said: Fans are preferable, but not guaranteed.Q: Where does virus situation stand in Tokyo?A: Tokyo reported a record single-day record of 463 new cases on Friday. The number tops the record set on Thursday of 367. Tokyo and Japan are experiencing a resurgence of the virus and officials have asked restaurants and bars to limit hours.ADADOverall, Japan has been relatively spared with 1,000 deaths attributed to COVID-19.Q: What is the status of the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics?A: Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin was asked this week about the possibility of the Winter Olympics being called off.\u201cChina will continue to support Japan in hosting the Olympics, and we also hope the Tokyo Olympics to be held as scheduled,\u201d Wang said.\u201cAt present, the preparations for the Beijing Winter Olympics are going on in an orderly manner as planned, and all parties, including the International Olympic Committee, have spoken highly of the progress in the preparations,\u201d Wang added.If Tokyo were canceled, the focus would shift immediately to China where the coronavirus was first detected. Beijing was awarded the Winter Games in 2015, ahead of Almaty, Kazakhstan, after several European bidders pulled out.ADADIOC President Thomas Bach warned two weeks ago about any threatened Olympic boycott. He didn\u2019t mention China, but the possibility would seem to be there with the rising tension between China and United States.___More AP Olympics: https://apnews.com/OlympicGames and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports___AP Tokyo correspondent Yuri Kageyama contributed to this report.Copyright 2020 The Associated Press.

I wish I hadn\u2019t.\u201dFast forward three-and-a-half years. During an interview on Tuesday, Trump said he has never raised U.S. intelligence that Russian bounties have been offered to Taliban-linked militants to kill American troops in Afghanistan during any of his conversations with Vladimir Putin, including a call with the Russian president last week. Trump demurred when Axios\u2019s Jonathan Swan asked whether he believes the U.S. intelligence assessment that Russia was behind the deadly program. Instead, just as Brennan says he did at Trump Tower, the president pivoted to China.ADAD\u201cYou know, it\u2019s interesting,\u201d Trump said. \u201cNobody ever brings up China. They always bring up Russia, Russia, Russia. If we can do something with Russia in terms of nuclear proliferation, which is a very big problem, a much bigger problem than global warming in terms of the real world, that would be a great thing.\u201dThese Russian bounties are believed to have resulted in the deaths of several U.S. service members, according to intelligence gleaned from U.S. military interrogations of captured militants in recent months. \u201cIt never reached my desk,\u201d Trump claimed in the interview, a portion of which was posted this morning and will air in full on HBO next week. The Washington Post and other outlets reported last month on the apparent bounty program, but Trump\u2019s aides argued that the intelligence was inconclusive.Trump went on to engage in the whataboutism that has been a hallmark of his tenure. When his interviewer noted that the former commanding general of U.S. forces in Afghanistan has said publicly that Russia is supplying weapons to the Taliban, Trump replied that the United States supplied weapons to the Taliban when they were challenging the Russian occupation in the 1980s. \u201cWe did that too,\u201d he said. In a statement at odds with both history and the facts on the ground, Trump added: \u201cRussia doesn\u2019t want anything to do with Afghanistan.\u201dThe president\u2019s continuing unwillingness to challenge the Kremlin comes as anonymous U.S. government officials are sounding the alarm that Russian intelligence services are using a trio of English-language websites to spread disinformation about the novel coronavirus pandemic. The Associated Press reports that \u201ctwo Russians who have held senior roles in Moscow\u2019s military intelligence service known as the GRU have been identified as responsible for a disinformation effort meant to reach American and Western audiences,\u201d citing U.S. officials who are not authorized to speak publicly.ADAD\u201cBetween late May and early July, one of the [U.S.] officials said, the websites singled out Tuesday published about 150 articles about the pandemic response, including coverage aimed either at propping up Russia or denigrating the U.S.,\u201d per the AP. \u201cOfficials described the Russian disinformation as part of an ongoing and persistent effort to advance false narratives and cause confusion. They did not say whether the effort behind these particular websites was directly related to the November election, though some of the coverage appeared to denigrate Trump\u2019s Democratic challenger, Joe Biden, and called to mind Russian efforts in 2016 \u2026\u00a0\u201cThough U.S. officials have warned before about the spread of disinformation tied to the pandemic, they went further on Tuesday by singling out a particular information agency that is registered in Russia, InfoRos, and that operates a series of websites \u2014 InfoRos.ru, Infobrics.org and OneWorld.press \u2014 that have leveraged the pandemic to promote anti-Western objectives and to spread disinformation. Officials say the sites promote their narratives in a sophisticated but insidious effort that they liken to money laundering, where stories in well-written English \u2014 and often with pro-Russian sentiment \u2014 are cycled through other news sources to conceal their origin and enhance the legitimacy of the information. \u2026 A headline Tuesday on InfoRos.ru about the unrest roiling American cities read \u2018Chaos in the Blue Cities\u2019 \u2026 Another story carried the headline of \u2018Ukrainian Trap for Biden,\u2019 and claimed that \u2018Ukrainegate\u2019 \u2014 a reference to stories surrounding Biden\u2019s son Hunter\u2019s former ties to a Ukraine gas company \u2014 \u2018keeps unfolding with renewed vigor.\u2019\u201dBrennan\u2019s new memoir, \u201cUndaunted: My Fight Against America\u2019s Enemies, at Home and Abroad,\u201d is scheduled to be published on Oct. 6.\u00a0My colleague Shane Harris, who has reviewed portions of the book, reports this morning that when Brennan asked the CIA, where he had worked for nearly 30 years, to review his official records, the agency said no. Brennan learned that this break with decades of tradition resulted from a directive issued by Trump in August 2018 to prohibit anyone in the intelligence community from sharing classified information with him. A White House spokesman confirms that Trump issued the order, tailored at one of his most outspoken critics.ADAD\u201cIn January of this year, Brennan says, he wrote to the current CIA director, Gina Haspel, after learning about the president\u2019s order,\u201d Shane reports. \u201cBrennan says Haspel never responded to his letter or contacted him to discuss the situation, a silence he found \u2018very disappointing\u2019 given their years working together at the CIA. \u2018So much for my fervent hope that interactions with my successors would be unencumbered by Washington\u2019s partisan waters,\u2019 Brennan writes, in a dig at Haspel, who current and former officials say has made it her practice to stay on Trump\u2019s good side.\u201dIn the section of his book recounting the Jan. 6, 2017, briefing at Trump Tower, Brennan writes that Trump seemed more interested in challenging the intelligence assessment than in understanding the threat posed by Russia. \u201cTrump\u2019s alertness never faded during the briefing, but his demeanor as well as his questions strongly revealed that he was uninterested in finding out what the Russians had done or in holding them to account,\u201d Brennan writes. \u201cIt was also my clear impression that he was seeking most to learn what we knew and how we knew it. That deeply troubled me, as I worried about what he might do with the information he was being given.\u201dAttorney General Bill Barr said Tuesday that Americans \u201chave to assume\u201d Russia is trying to interfere in the looming election, though he offered no specifics. During an acrimonious House Judiciary Committee hearing, Rep. David Cicilline (D-R.I.) asked Barr whether it would be appropriate for the president \u201cto solicit or accept foreign assistance in an election.\u201d Barr answered that \u201cit depends what kind of assistance.\u201d Cicilline said he was referring \u201cany kind\u201d of assistance, to which Barr answered more definitively: \u201cNo, it\u2019s not appropriate.\u201d Rep. Cedric Richmond (D-La.) asked Barr if he believes the election will be \u201crigged.\u201d Trump has repeatedly suggested as much. \u201cI have no reason to think it will be,\u201d Barr said.ADADThe attorney general also defended his interventions in the criminal cases of Trump\u2019s friends and allies, including the president\u2019s longtime political adviser Roger Stone and former national security adviser Michael Flynn. Barr claimed he was unaware at the time that the Justice Department\u2019s Bureau of Prisons had decided Trump\u2019s ex-attorney Michael Cohen should go back to prison for refusing to agree not to talk to the media or write a book, which will accuse Trump of making racist and anti-Semitic comments.\u00a0Stone was convicted of tampering with a witness and lying to Congress about his efforts to learn of Democratic emails that had been hacked by the Russians during the 2016 campaign. Trump commuted Stone\u2019s sentence this month shortly before he was due to report to prison. Flynn twice pleaded guilty to lying to FBI agents to conceal conversations he had with the then-Russian ambassador during the transition. Barr has moved to dismiss the case against Flynn altogether. Cohen, who flipped on the president, pleaded guilty to lying to Congress about a Moscow real estate project that Trump and his company pursued as he ran for president in 2016. In his plea deal, he said he knowingly lied under oath to hew closely to Trump\u2019s public denials of his business interests in Russia.\u00a0\u201cThe president\u2019s friends don\u2019t deserve special breaks,\" Barr said during the hearing, \u201cbut they also don\u2019t deserve to be treated more harshly than other people.\u201dThe coronavirus contagionCoronavirus cases are on the rise in the Midwest as they ebb in the Sun Belt.\u201cAnthony S. Fauci, the nation\u2019s leading infectious-disease expert, warned that positive coronavirus tests were rising in Ohio, Indiana, Tennessee and Kentucky as the number of new cases is showing signs of leveling off in Florida, Texas, Arizona and California,\u201d Carol Morello reports:ADAD\u201cA few hours later, Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine (R) said Fauci\u2019s appraisal was correct as he announced limits on county fairs, barring grandstand events, rides and games. He noted that emergency visits are decreasing and new cases have plateaued, but hospitalizations are on the upswing. Stressing the highly infectious nature of the virus, DeWine told reporters at his televised briefing about a 40-minute car ride that four people recently took to an Ohio lake. One person had the virus but didn\u2019t know it. Within days, 10 people were sick, with two hospitalized and in intensive care, and three businesses had to be temporarily shuttered. \u2026 Ohio State University told season ticket holders that any football games at Ohio Stadium this year will be at 20 percent capacity, with no tailgating allowed. \u2026 DeWine, who put a mask mandate into effect two weeks ago, said two good friends contracted the disease, one of whom died. A member of his cabinet, the director of Ohio\u2019s prison system, announced Monday that she had tested positive for the coronavirus.\"\u201cKentucky Gov. Andy Beshear (D) on Monday announced that bars would be shut down for two weeks and that restaurants\u2019 indoor dining would be restricted to 25 percent capacity. He also recommended schools postpone in-person instruction until late August. In Virginia, Gov. Ralph Northam (D) announced new restrictions on restaurants and gatherings in the Hampton Roads area as new coronavirus cases rise. \u2026 Nationwide, the number of cases appears to have leveled off to a seven-day moving average of around 66,000 new cases daily. The slight decline registered Tuesday followed five weeks of steadily rising numbers. At least 4,315,000 coronavirus cases have been reported in the United States, with more than 54,000 added to the tally on Monday. More than 1,000 new fatalities were recorded Monday, raising the U.S. death toll to more than 145,000.\u201dEvidence is growing that young people who work outside the home, or who surged into bars and restaurants when states relaxed shutdowns, are infecting their more vulnerable elders, especially family members. (Lenny Bernstein)The Miami Marlins outbreak has forced Major League Baseball to shuffle the schedule of five teams.\u201cThe Marlins, who have seen fully half their 30-man roster test positive for the coronavirus in the past five days, were shut down through Sunday, and the Philadelphia Phillies, who hosted the Marlins for three games over the weekend, through Thursday,\u201d Dave Sheinin reports. \u201cMeanwhile, the Yankees, who were expecting to play the Phillies in New York on Wednesday and Thursday, will instead travel to Baltimore to play the Orioles on those days as MLB moved to keep as many teams playing as possible. \u2026\u00a0ADAD\u201cThe Marlins\u2019 shutdown also avoided a potential clash between MLB and the Washington Nationals, whose players voted near-unanimously Monday against playing in Miami against the Marlins this weekend in their scheduled series \u2014 which has now been postponed, with the Nationals getting the weekend off. It was unclear, and may remain so, whether the Nationals were willing to go so far as to boycott the series had MLB insisted it go on. \u2026\u201cWith a total of 11 postponements so far, and with an already-compressed schedule that makes it difficult if not impossible to make them all up, it appears increasingly probable some teams could play fewer than 60 games \u2014 in which case MLB would probably determine division standings and playoff spots by winning percentage. That would be similar to the strike-shortened 1981 season, in which some teams played as many as 111 games and some as few as 103.\u201dNew England Patriots linebacker Dont\u2019a Hightower has opted out of playing the 2020 NFL season. \u201cHightower, a two-time Pro Bowl selection and a three-time Super Bowl winner in eight seasons with New England, becomes one of the more accomplished players to choose against playing this season as teams open their training camps,\u201d Mask Maske reports.

Democratic leaders accused McConnell of not wanting a deal at all, while one Republican senator called the new GOP bill \u2018a mess.\u2019 \u2026 Democratic leaders also balked Tuesday at a five-year liability shield included in the GOP plan, aimed at protecting health-care providers, schools, employers and others from lawsuits from people who become ill from the virus.

(Laura Reiley)A scathing SBA inspector general report details \u201cpervasive\u201d fraud in a coronavirus disaster-loan program.\u201cA federal watchdog reported Tuesday that it has identified $250 million in taxpayer-subsidized coronavirus loan funds given to \u2018potentially ineligible recipients,\u2019 pointing to a strong likelihood of widespread fraud in an important but troubled economic assistance program,\u201d Aaron Gregg reports. \u201cThe Small Business Administration\u2019s office of inspector general launched numerous investigations after receiving more than 1,000 hotline complaints about potentially fraudulent transactions \u2026 It also criticized the agency for allegedly failing to put in place internal controls to prevent abuse. Among the potentially fraudulent transactions detailed in the report are $1.9 million in pending SBA transactions made to accounts outside the United States, roughly 3,000 \u2018suspicious\u2019 transactions worth $73 million that were flagged by a banking service provider.\u00a0\u201cA credit union told the Justice Department that 59 out of 60 SBA deposits it received appeared to be fraudulent. \u2026 The Economic Injury Disaster Loans (EIDL) program was the first federal small-business assistance program activated to fight the economic crisis caused by the coronavirus pandemic.

So has a president who resisted role modeling the benefits of face coverings, and who belittled those who did,\u201d Griff Witte, Ariana Eunjung Cha and Josh Dawsey report. \u201cThe result, experts say, is a country that squandered one of its best opportunities to beat back the coronavirus pandemic this spring and summer. In the process, the United States fell far behind other nations that skipped the fuss over masks, costing lives and jeopardizing the recovery heading into the fall. \u2026 The country hit a tipping point on widespread mask use only this month, with a majority of states and the nation\u2019s largest retailers all mandating them. But the science has long been pointing toward the efficacy of masks \u2014 even if the guidance from health authorities wasn\u2019t.\u201dLabor unions representing transportation workers are pleading with the U.S. Department of Transportation to issue an emergency rule ordering passengers to wear masks on planes, buses and trains or be denied a ride. \u201cThe Transportation Department has been willing to waive existing safety rules at the request of industry groups to ease the transportation of freight on trucks, trains and airplanes.

(Jeanne Whalen)Divided AmericaConservative armed groups are moving into politics as backlash builds against protests.\u201cBefore his political awakening this spring, Peter Diaz lived a quiet life near this leafy liberal bastion at the base of the Puget Sound. He ran a tree-trimming service and a business that built office cubicles. He was 37 and had never voted,\u201d Josh Partlow reports from Olympia, Wash. \u201cNow he has formed his own political party and is the leader of American Wolf, a roving band of civilians who have anointed themselves \u2018peacekeepers\u2019 amid months of tense protests over racism and policing. In the name of law and order, members of his informal group have shot paintballs at demonstrators and carry zip ties and bear spray as they look for antifascists. Diaz has done \u2018recon\u2019 in Minneapolis and Seattle\u2019s \u2018autonomous zone,\u2019 and drove his American Wolf mobile home to Mount Rushmore to celebrate Independence Day with President Trump.\u201cAmerica\u2019s summer of anxiety and rage has swept up men like Diaz, energizing conservatives who are deploying to the front lines of the culture war. Across the country, conservative armed civilians have surged into public view \u2014 marching on statehouses, challenging Black Lives Matter protests, chasing Internet rumors \u2014 and bringing the threat of lethal force to local politics. Their emergence has prompted congressional hearings on the surge in anti-government militias and domestic extremism and has alarmed researchers who track hate groups. Unlike the old image of militiamen as fringe elements motivated by a desire to overthrow the federal government, these groups often rally in defense of the president and see themselves as pro-government allies of local law enforcement.\u201dTrump is limiting DACA work permits, as his administration looks into ways to end the program.\u201cThe White House said Tuesday it will limit work permits for undocumented immigrants brought to the United States as children to one year instead of two, as administration officials reconsider whether to terminate an eight-year-old program that protects such immigrants from deportation,\u201d Maria Sacchetti reports. \u201cThe move comes more than a month after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled 5 to 4 that the Trump administration could not carry out its plans to end the Obama-era program known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, because it had not provided proper legal justification for terminating it. \u2026 Acting Department of Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf published a memo on Tuesday limiting the work permits and signaling that DACA \u2018presents serious policy concerns that may warrant its full rescission.\u2019 He said he would continue to bar new applications. \u2026 Approximately 640,000 people remain in the program, and many are health-care workers, teachers and emergency responders.\u201dHow would the armed forces respond if Trump pulled them into a disputed election?\u201cTrump\u2019s refusal to commit to accepting the results of the November election, paired with his penchant for plunging the military into the partisan fray, has prompted scholars and legal experts to ask a once-unthinkable question,\u201d Missy Ryan and Paul Sonne report. \u201cScholars cautioned that they are not suggesting that the military would proactively seek to influence the vote, but rather that Pentagon leaders could be forced in a disputed election to become involved in a way that would appear partisan, similar to what occurred in the nation\u2019s capital in the wake of protests in June. History suggests military involvement is unlikely, experts say. But since the first days of Trump\u2019s presidency, when he used the Pentagon\u2019s Hall of Heroes to sign a ban on travel from majority-Muslim nations, the president has repeatedly defied civil-military norms, treating troop events like campaign rallies and intervening in military justice cases.\u201dViral video shows NYPD officers forcing protester into unmarked van.\u201cWhen an unmarked Kia minivan screeched to a stop near protesters marching in Manhattan on Tuesday evening, the demonstrators\u2019 surprise swiftly gave way to alarm.

They say the cases highlight the difficulties they often face in trying to unravel these incidents, which are often clouded by claims of self-defense or lost or disoriented drivers. \u2026\u00a0\u201cSince the eruption of coast-to-coast protests after the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis on Memorial Day, dozens of motorists have been recorded driving their vehicles into marchers on city streets or highways. The encounters have produced terrifying videos of protesters leaping to safety or being rammed by vehicles, the latest sign of the nation\u2019s political and cultural division. Researcher Ari Weil, of the Chicago Project on Security and Threats (CPOST) at the University of Chicago, has documented 75 cases of drivers moving into protests between May 27 and July 7 \u2014 68 involving civilians and seven involving law enforcement. But prosecutors had filed charges in just 33 of those cases, with drivers accused of recklessness or felony assault and, in one case, facing a state hate-crime charge. \u2026 The incidents highlight just how dangerous some protests have become, including demonstrators now arming themselves to try to self-police their events.\u201dThe electionsJoe Biden said he will make a decision on his running mate by the end of next week.\u201cBiden said he was not sure whether he would be able to meet face-to-face with the women vying to be his running mate, considering coronavirus concerns,\u201d Annie Linskey and Sean Sullivan report. \u201c\u2018We\u2019ll see,\u2019 he said, speaking to reporters in Wilmington, Del., after giving an address on his new economic plan for racial equality.

The Constitution gives Congress, not the president, the power to regulate the \u201ctime, place and manner\u201d of federal elections. A chorus of Republican legislative leaders promptly pushed back on the president\u2019s trial balloon. They made clear that Election Day will not change this year.ADADBut make no mistake: The voting wars are just beginning. The cascading legislative and judicial battles over ballot access and related issues seem poised to escalate over the coming months. Trump\u2019s preemptive efforts to cast doubt on the legitimacy and integrity of the election, combined with his refusal to commit that he will respect the results, raise the specter that the results will be challenged in court. It is not inconceivable the Supreme Court might need to get involved, as it did in Bush v. Gore in 2000, especially if the outcome is close.\u201cI want to have the election, but I also don\u2019t want to wait for three months and find out that all the ballots are all missing and the election won\u2019t mean anything,\u201d Trump said at a Thursday news conference. \u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen, and everyone knows it.\u201dLate Thursday, a divided Supreme Court issued an emergency ruling to shut down a lower court\u2019s decision that cited the coronavirus as a justification to ease the rules on gathering signatures for a ballot initiative. \u201cThe case from Idaho was the latest example of the high court deferring to state officials, rather than lower-court judges, in how to deal with election-related issues caused by the outbreak of covid-19,\u201d Robert Barnes reports. \u201cThe justices put on hold a lower-court order that Idaho officials either put on the ballot an education initiative promoted by a group called Reform Idaho or allow the group to gather signatures electronically, although the deadline had passed. \u2026 In this election year, the court is increasingly being called upon to decide election issues related to the pandemic. The conservative justices have been in the majority as the court in most cases has sided with state officials when they ask for stays from lower court decisions they don\u2019t like.\u201dADADChief Justice John Roberts was joined by Justices Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch, who were nominated by Trump, as well as Justice Samuel Alito, in writing for the majority. \u201cThe District Court did not accord sufficient weight to the State\u2019s discretionary judgments about how to prioritize limited state resources across the election system as a whole,\u201d Roberts wrote.Liberal justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ruth Bader Ginsburg dissented. \u201cBy jumping ahead of the court of appeals, this court once again forgets that it is \u2018a court of review, not of first view\u2019 [and] undermines the public\u2019s expectation that its highest court will act only after considered deliberation,\u201d Sotomayor wrote. (It is unclear from the order how Justices Clarence Thomas, Stephen Breyer and Elena Kagan voted, but at least one of them sided with Roberts to give him a fifth vote.)Trump has attacked mail voting nearly 70 times since late March in interviews, remarks and tweets, including at least 17 times this month. \u201cSeveral Trump advisers said no internal discussions were underway within the White House about moving the date. The tweet caught aides by surprise, said one senior adviser \u2026 \u2018He is just trolling,\u2019 said another,\u201d Amy Gardner, Josh Dawsey and John Wagner report. \u201cA recent study by Stanford University researchers found no partisan impact of expanding voting by mail.\u201dADADPresident Abraham Lincoln said postponing the 1864 election, during the Civil War, would mean \u201cour system has been defeated.\u201d President Franklin Roosevelt said postponing the 1942 election, during World War II, would mean \u201cwe have become fascists ourselves,\u201d according to presidential historian Michael Beschloss.Many conservative thought leaders expressed alarm about Trump\u2019s suggestion to postpone the election.\u00a0Steven Calabresi, a co-founder of the conservative Federalist Society that has helped the administration identify committed conservatives for judicial appointments, called Trump\u2019s tweet appalling and argued that it could be \u201cgrounds for the president\u2019s immediate impeachment\u201d a second time. \u201cUntil recently, I had taken as political hyperbole the Democrats\u2019 assertion that President Trump is a fascist. But this latest tweet is fascistic,\u201d wrote Calabresi, a Northwestern University law professor, in an op-ed for the New York Times.\u201cTrump\u2019s suggestion to delay the election is the most anti-democratic thing any president ever said,\u201d writes conservative columnist Henry Olsen.ADADThe Wall Street Journal\u2019s conservative editorial board says delaying the election is \u201ca dreadful idea.\u201dThe U.S. Postal Service is experiencing days-long backlogs of mail across the country after a top Trump donor, who was recently installed atop the agency, imposed policy changes. Insiders warn that these will cause chaos and disenfranchise voters in November.\u00a0\u201cPostal employees and union officials say the changes implemented by Trump fundraiser-turned-postmaster general Louis DeJoy are contributing to a growing perception that mail delays are the result of a political effort to undermine absentee voting,\u201d Michelle Ye Hee Lee and Jacob Bogage report. \u201cThe new policies have resulted in at least a two-day delay in scattered parts of the country, even for express mail, according to multiple postal workers and union leaders. Letter carriers are manually sorting more mail, adding to the delivery time. Bins of mail ready for delivery are sitting in post offices because of scheduling and route changes. \u2026\u201cVoters and postal workers have reported scattered problems across the country in recent days, including in key battleground states such as Wisconsin, Michigan, North Carolina and Pennsylvania, raising concerns among residents whether their states are being targeted because of their importance in the presidential and Senate elections. In Michigan, which is gearing up for its Aug. 4 primary, election administrators said they have fielded complaints from voters who had not yet received their ballots as of this week. Election clerks are advising voters to drop off their ballot Tuesday rather than sending it back via mail, out of fear that the ballots will not be returned in time to be counted. \u2026 A delay in delivering ballots to voters and then returning them to election officials could cause people to be disenfranchised \u2014 especially in states that require ballots to be returned by Election Day, voting rights experts warn.ADAD\u201cAlready, tens of thousands of ballots across the country have been disqualified in this year\u2019s primaries, many because they did not arrive in time. In Wisconsin, 2,659 ballots that were returned after the April 13 deadline for the spring primary were not counted due to their late arrival, according to the state election commission. In California, 70,330 ballots were disqualified because they missed the deadline, according to an AP analysis.\u201dFormer president Barack Obama used his eulogy at John Lewis\u2019s funeral on Thursday to outline specific actions related to voting.\u00a0He said the best way to honor the late congressman and civil rights leader is to restore key provisions of the Voting Rights Act that were struck down in 2013 and to overturn state laws that he said are designed to suppress minority voters. Obama then called for automatic voter registration, restoring voting rights for felons who have been released from jail, expanded early voting hours, a national holiday for Election Day and \u201cequal representation\u201d in the federal government for citizens of the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico.\u201cWe may no longer have to guess the number of jelly beans in a jar in order to cast a ballot, but even as we sit here, there are those in power who are doing their darnedest to discourage people from voting by closing polling locations and targeting minorities and students with restrictive ID laws and attacking our voting rights with surgical precision, even undermining the Postal Service in the run-up to an election that\u2019s going to be dependent on mail-in ballots so people don\u2019t get sick,\u201d Obama said in a 40-minute speech.ADADMost significantly, the former president endorsed changing the rules of the Senate if that would be necessary to achieve these goals.\u00a0\u201cAnd if all this takes eliminating the filibuster, another Jim Crow relic, in order to secure the God-given rights of every American, then that\u2019s what we should do,\u201d Obama said. (As a senator from Illinois, Obama sought to filibuster Alito\u2019s confirmation to the Supreme Court. As president, he said he \u201cregrets\u201d doing so.)Quote of the day\u201cKeep moving to the ballot box, even if it\u2019s a mailbox,\u201d former president Bill Clinton said during his eulogy.Meanwhile, members of Trump\u2019s Cabinet stayed silent about possibly postponing the election.\u00a0A Justice Department spokeswoman declined to comment on Trump\u2019s tweet. Attorney General Bill Barr demurred during a House hearing earlier this week when asked whether Trump could move the election. \u201cI\u2019ve never looked into it,\u201d Barr told Rep. Cedric Richmond (D-La.).ADADSecretary of State Mike Pompeo declined to say on Thursday whether Trump trying to postpone the election would be illegal or wrong. Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) asked Pompeo during a Foreign Relations Committee hearing about the appropriateness of the president\u2019s tweet. All Pompeo would say was that the election \u201cshould happen lawfully.\u201dThe coronavirusTrump called on Americans who have recovered from covid-19 to donate blood plasma.\u201cThe call for donors is based on a simple, but powerful fact about the immune system,\u201d Carolyn Johnson reports. \u201cPeople who recover from a coronavirus infection typically have virus-blocking antibodies circulating in their blood in the weeks after they recover. Those antibodies can be harvested in plasma donations and transfused to the next people who get sick, helping boost their immune systems. In contrast, developing treatments for a new virus is an uncertain and time-consuming process. Blood plasma from people who have successfully recovered from coronavirus infection has been widely used in the United States, even though researchers are still gathering evidence to definitively show it works. About 50,000 people have been transfused with the treatment, called convalescent plasma, under an expanded access program sponsored by the Food and Drug Administration.\"ADADThe federal government announced a $2.1 billion agreement Friday with the French pharmaceutical company Sanofi and its British partner, GSK, to support the development of a coronavirus vaccine the companies are working on together.

The others, mostly conservative economists, agreed that Congress needs to act by mid-August.

The son of sharecroppers almost died at 25 when state troopers beat him viciously, cracking his skull, as he led 600 protesters in a march across the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Ala. During 17 terms in Congress, he championed voting rights.Pence visited the Capitol to pay tribute to his former House colleague. Former vice president Biden drove down from Delaware, with his wife, Jill, to honor Lewis. The Bidens placed their hands on the casket. Biden\u2019s potential vice-presidential picks Sens. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), and Reps. Karen Bass (D-Calif.) and Val Demings (D-Fla.), also came. Congressional Republicans were well represented, led by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.) and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (Calif.).ADLawmakers from both parties gave a standing ovation after a recording was played of Lewis calling for racial justice during a 2014 commencement speech at Emory University. \u201cSupreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor, members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper and congressional aides quietly streamed past the flag-draped casket, which was moved to the top of the East Front steps Monday evening for the public to pay tribute,\u201d Paul Kane, Felicia Sonmez, Meagan Flynn and Michael Brice-Saddler report. \u201cThe tributes at the Capitol came shortly after Lewis\u2019s body made its last visit to Washington\u2019s civil rights landmarks midday Monday, pausing at the Lincoln Memorial, where he was the youngest speaker at the 1963 March on Washington. The motorcade also stopped at the Martin Luther King Jr. memorial, and the newly minted Black Lives Matter Plaza outside the White House, where he made his last public appearance in early June.\u201dQuote of the day\u201cEven though the world around him gave him every cause for bitterness, he stubbornly treated everyone with respect and love,\u201d McConnell said of Lewis.White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany defended Trump\u2019s response to Lewis\u2019s death, noting that he signed a proclamation lowering the flag to half-staff to recognize his civil rights work. The U.S. Flag Code, however, already specifies that flags should be flown at half-staff \u201con the day of death and the following day for a Member of Congress.\u201dADADLewis is only the second black lawmaker in American history to lay in state in the Capitol. The other was Cummings, a close friend, who died in October. Trump also skipped Cummings\u2019s ceremony and funeral. (In addition to Graham, the president visited the Capitol in December 2018 when former president George H.W. Bush was lying in state.)Lewis and Cummings were both outspoken Trump critics. Lewis refused to attend Trump\u2019s inauguration in 2017 on the rationale that he was an illegitimate president because of Russian interference in the previous year\u2019s election. (There is no evidence that any votes were changed. Lewis had also refused to attend George W. Bush\u2019s inauguration in 2001.)Trump lashed out at the congressman, accusing him of being \u201call talk\u201d with \u201cno action or results,\u201d a tone-deaf critique that dominated multiple news cycles. Lewis and other African Americans in Congress later declined to attend the dedication of a civil rights museum in Mississippi because Trump was scheduled to come, as well.ADADLast August, a few months before Cummings died, Trump appeared to poke fun at the congressman after his Baltimore house was burglarized, tweeting: \u201cReally bad news! \u2026 Too bad!\u201d The president later denied he was being facetious after several Republicans had criticized the message, telling reporters on his way to golf at his club in New Jersey that he was not trying to be a \u201cwise guy.\u201d But it had followed days of Trump relentlessly ripping Cummings, who as chairman of the House Oversight Committee was scrutinizing his conduct and issuing subpoenas to his administration. Trump called the city Cummings represented \u201ca rodent infected mess,\u201d said residents are \u201cliving in hell,\u201d blamed Cummings for the city\u2019s problems and claimed that thousands of African Americans had thanked him for spotlighting the city\u2019s problems.Indeed, some of their friends might have been relieved that Trump stayed away from the memorial events. Bass, the chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, tweeted at Trump shortly after Lewis\u2019s death: \u201cWhile the nation mourns the passing of a national hero, please say nothing. Please don\u2019t comment on the life of Congressman Lewis.\u201dTrump skipped McCain\u2019s funeral at the request of the family of the 2008 GOP presidential nominee. The president had said during the 2016 campaign that the former prisoner of war in Vietnam was not a war hero because he got captured. Trump has continued to attack McCain since his death, especially for his decisive vote against the repeal of the Affordable Care Act.ADADOn the night Trump was impeached by the House in December, he suggested during a rally in Michigan that Dingell was \u201clooking up\u201d at the crowd from hell. The president then laced into Rep. Debbie Dingell (D-Mich.), his widow who now holds his seat. Dingell was the longest-serving member of the House in U.S. history and had died just months earlier. Trump did not attend his funeral.The \u201clooking up\u201d riff came the week before Christmas, and the congresswoman replied on Twitter: \u201cMy husband earned all his accolades after a lifetime of service. I\u2019m preparing for the first holiday season without the man I love. You brought me down in a way you can never imagine and your hurtful words just made my healing much harder.\u201dCoronavirus falloutTwitter penalized Donald Trump Jr. for posting hydroxychloroquine misinformation.\u201cThe platform ordered the president\u2019s son to delete the misleading tweet and said it would \u2018limit some account functionality for 12 hours,\u2019\u201d Katie Shepherd and Taylor Telford report. \u201cOn Monday evening, Facebook scrubbed from its site a viral video showing a group of doctors making misleading and false claims about the coronavirus pandemic after more than 14 million people had watched it. Hours later, President Trump tweeted out multiple clips of the same video to his 84.2 million followers. Trump shared the video \u2014 which claims that face masks and shutdowns are not needed to stop the spread of the virus \u2014 as he shared 14 tweets over a half-hour span defending the use of hydroxychloroquine, an antimalarial drug that the president has repeatedly promoted \u2026 Twitter soon followed Facebook and YouTube in removing the videos, deleting several of the tweets that Trump shared, and even adding a note to its trending topics warning about the potential risks of hydroxychloroquine use.\u201dThe GOP gave Trump money for the new FBI headquarters he wants a block from his hotel.\u201cUnder intense White House pressure, Senate Republicans agreed Monday to allocate $1.75 billion in their coronavirus relief bill toward the construction of a new D.C. headquarters for the FBI,\u201d Jonathan O'Connell, Seung Min Kim and Erica Werner report. \u201cBut top Senate Republicans immediately began distancing themselves from the provision after it was made public, saying they weren\u2019t sure why the White House repeatedly insisted on putting it in the bill. At a news conference Monday, [McConnell] initially denied that the FBI money was in the bill, but then was notified by reporters that the language was in fact included. \u2018You\u2019ll have to ask them why they insisted that be included,\u2019 he told reporters, referring to the White House. \u2026 Asked Monday what a new FBI building had to do with the novel coronavirus, Sen. Richard C. Shelby (R-Ala.), a key negotiator of the stimulus package, paused and said, \u2018Good question.\u2019 \u2026ADAD\u201cBefore Trump was elected, officials at his company raised concerns about a competing hotel possibly being built in place of the Hoover Building should the FBI relocate to the suburbs. \u2026 Concerns over Trump\u2019s financial interests, however, prompted the Justice Department\u2019s Inspector General Michael E. Horowitz to launch an investigation of the decision-making that led to the cancellation of the original plan. That investigation remains ongoing more than a year later, the inspector general\u2019s office said Monday. A spokeswoman declined to comment further.\u201dDemocrats were sharply critical of the White House demand. \u201cThey managed to have enough money for $2 billion for the FBI headquarters that benefits Trump hotel and they say they have no money for food assistance,\u201d said Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.). \u201cWhat the heck is going on?\u201d (I wrote Friday about how Trump\u2019s demand for this money in the coronavirus package is the latest example of how he doesn\u2019t have his eye on the ball as cascading crises buffet the country.)McConnell has said this bill will likely represent the last major legislative response by congressional Republicans to the coronavirus pandemic. \u201cSenate Republicans\u2019 legislation, titled the \u2018Heals Act,\u2019 is expected to kick off negotiations with congressional Democrats, who have already vowed to oppose many of the provisions in the Republican plan,\u201d Jeff Stein, Laura Meckler and Tony Romm report. \u201cHouse Democrats in May approved a $3 trillion coronavirus response package that sharply diverges from McConnell\u2019s bill in key ways, leaving the path toward a final compromise unclear on many key questions. \u2026 The legislation is also notable for what it leaves out, as the GOP opted against including new funding for state and local governments and hazard pay for essential front-line workers \u2026 McConnell\u2019s bill includes a five-year \u2018liability shield\u2019 aimed at preventing businesses, universities, schools and hospitals from being sued over coronavirus-related damages.\u201dADADThe Senate bill fails to extend the suspension of federal student loan payments beyond September, drawing the ire of consumer advocates who are urging Congress to offer more help to the 43 million Americans holding $1.6 trillion in education debt. (Danielle Douglas-Gabriel)But the GOP legislation does offer a 100 percent deduction on business meals through the end of 2020 to help high-end restaurants. Experts note that few businesses are paying for their employees to eat out during the pandemic. (I wrote in March about how Trump started pushing for this after he got a phone call from celebrity chef Wolfgang Puck.)Several GOP senators got other stuff they wanted to secure their support for the bill. \"McConnell and his team worked for days to try to put together a $1 trillion package that could unite Republicans in a way that would strengthen their negotiating power with Democrats, but there were signs Monday that Republicans remain split over how to proceed,\u201d Erica, Jeff and Seung Min report. \u201cNew parts of the legislation included a proposal from Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) aimed at bringing production lines back to the United States from China, legislation by Sen. John Cornyn (R-Tex.) that would increase incentives for advanced chip manufacturing, and a measure written by Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio) that would address intellectual property theft at federal funded research centers and universities.\u201dADADSen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.), who clashed last week with Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) over deficit spending, said last night that \u201cthere is significant resistance to yet another trillion dollars\u201d: \u201cThe answer to these challenges will not simply be shoveling cash out of Washington; the answer to these challenges will be getting people back to work. And as it stands now, I think it\u2019s likely that you\u2019ll see a number of Republicans in opposition to this bill and expressing serious concerns.\u201dPPP was intended to keep employees on the payroll. Workers at some big companies have yet to be rehired.\u201cIf the name of the Paycheck Protection Program didn\u2019t make its purpose clear, its key sponsors spelled it out. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) explained that the program \u2018was designed as an alternative for unemployment and to prevent unemployment,\u2019\u201d Peter Whoriskey reports. \u201cBut a closer look at three large companies that received millions from the $517 billion program shows that some companies have not retained most of their staff on the payrolls. \u2026 And the Omni Hotels & Resorts, owned by Texas billionaire Robert Rowling, were approved for multiple loans from the program \u2014 one for each of 15 hotels \u2014 totaling $30 million to $71 million. But seven remain closed, and at those, most workers are on unpaid furloughs, union officials said. The company also has declined union requests to continue to pay health insurance for furloughed workers, union officials said.\u201dTemp agencies were some of the biggest beneficiaries of PPP. Many have been able to turn the government loans into profits. (ProPublica)A Florida man was charged with fraud after receiving $3.9 million in loans from the Paycheck Protection Program to buy himself, among other things, a Lamborghini sports car, the Justice Department said.

Meanwhile, renters face more job losses and fear eviction,\u201d Heather Long reports. \u201cFor Realtor James Dietsche, there is only one way to describe the real estate market right now: \u2018It\u2019s insane.\u2019 A 1950s style three-bedroom home he listed in late June for $200,000 in a small town outside Harrisburg, Pa., received 26 offers the initial weekend it was for sale. Many buyers were young couples seeking a starter home and retirees looking to downsize. But bids also came from Philadelphia, New York City and the Washington, D.C., area. One person was willing to pay up to $50,000 above asking. Several were offering to buy it without inspections.\u201cWhile Dietsche\u2019s cellphone has been ringing with eager buyers, Tammy Steen\u2019s phone has been buzzing for a different reason. Her landlord keeps calling demanding the $700 rent she does not have. Steen, 52, was a hotel housekeeper at a Hampton Inn in Pensacola, Fla. Her temporary layoff now looks permanent. She has yet to receive unemployment aid despite applying in late March. She has applied to countless fast food, retail and maid jobs but has not been hired. She has started selling hot dogs on the side of the road to beachgoers, praying she does not become homeless.\"Two potential coronavirus vaccines are moving into the last phase of testing with 30,000-person trials.Anthony S.

As the virus and related lockdown orders have disrupted trade routes, closed markets and isolated millions from food and medicine, about 128,000 additional children under 5 will die over the outbreak\u2019s first year, their analysis shows,\u201d per Teo Armus. \u201cModeling food supplies in 118 countries, the experts found that measures to contain the virus \u2014 from social distancing and school closures to lockdowns and closed borders \u2014 have pushed communities already stricken with hunger and other woes over the edge. More than half of all deaths, they said, were in sub-Saharan Africa and in war-torn Yemen. Their study was accompanied by an urgent call to action from the heads of several U.N. agencies, including the World Health Organization and UNICEF, who urged global leaders to contribute at least $2.4 billion immediately to address hunger.\u201d (Read the Lancet article here.)Trump reportedly announced he would throw the first pitch at a Yankees game because he was jealous of Fauci.\u201cAn hour before Dr. Anthony S. Fauci threw the first pitch at the season opener between the New York Yankees and the Washington Nationals, President Trump stood on the briefing room stage at the White House and declared that he, too, had been invited to throw out his own opening pitch. Mr. Trump had not actually been invited on that day by the Yankees, according to one person with knowledge of Mr. Trump\u2019s schedule. His announcement surprised both Yankees officials and the White House staff,\u201d the New York Times reports. \u201cBut Mr. Trump had been so annoyed by Dr. Fauci\u2019s turn in the limelight, an official familiar with his reaction said, that he had directed his aides to call Yankees officials \u2026 After the president\u2019s announcement, White House aides scrambled to let the team know that he was actually booked on Aug. 15, although they have not said what he plans to do. Over the weekend, Mr. Trump officially canceled. \u2026\u201cDr. Fauci\u2019s broadcast appearances are generally controlled by the White House, but the appearance at Nationals Park did not have to go through the usual clearance process at the National Institutes of Health, which takes in his other news media and event requests. \u2026 Off the baseball field, Dr. Fauci\u2019s star turn has not gone over as well in the White House. \u2026 As the prominence of the coronavirus task force faded in recent weeks, Dr. Fauci was left out of a new group of White House officials that meets on the virus, led by Jared Kushner, the president\u2019s son-in-law\u2026\u201dThe Marlins\u2019 coronavirus outbreak won\u2019t derail MLB\u2019s just-opened season \u2014 at least not yet.\u201cFor now, the outbreak among members of the Miami Marlins \u2014 with 11 players and two coaches testing positive by Monday, according to an official familiar with the testing \u2014 has not brought down the entire MLB season, and MLB officials hoped the outbreak would be limited to the Marlins, allowing the season to go forward,\u201d Dave Sheinin reports. \"While MLB officials stressed the outbreak was limited to just one team, other teams, including the Cincinnati Reds and Atlanta Braves, have experienced multiple positive tests or symptomatic players in recent days. And if an outbreak spreads across one team, it increases the likelihood of the virus being transmitted to an opponent or \u2014 in the case of the Yankees, who were about to use the same visiting clubhouse at Philadelphia\u2019s Citizens Bank Park that the Marlins just vacated \u2014 potentially a third team as well.

The Department of Homeland Security is also considering a plan to send an additional 50 U.S. Customs and Border Protection personnel to the city,\u201d Devlin Barrett, Nick Miroff, Marissa J. Lang and David Fahrenthold report. \u201cThat may yet work as a campaign tactic, if it provides Trump a way to sell himself as a law-and-order candidate, the antidote to chaos that developed on his own watch. But as a policing tactic, it has failed to suppress the protests. The escalation has been followed by larger, better-equipped and more-aggressive crowds, and \u2014 as the new reinforcements showed \u2014 it exhausted federal resources before it exhausted the protesters. \u2026\u201cThere is growing concern among federal law enforcement officials that some individuals in the crowds outside the courthouse have gotten more aggressive in recent days, and that the number of federal agents on site may not be sufficient to handle them. Protesters have injured federal agents with large commercial-grade fireworks while others aimed lasers at their eyes, leading to several injuries, DHS officials said. Now officials and demonstrators in other cities that have experienced ongoing protests against police violence fear that federal agents will bring the same tactics to them. \u2026 Some federal law enforcement officials worry that agents in Portland may be losing control of the streets around the federal courthouse and losing the public debate over their handling of the unrest.\"\u201cA protest in Austin turned fatal on Saturday when a driver navigated his vehicle toward the marchers and fired at 28-year-old protester Garrett Foster, who had brought an assault rifle to a march, police said. The driver \u2014 fired upon by a third armed man at the scene \u2014 was not injured, officials said, and police released him while their investigation continued. On Sunday evening, other protesters remembered Foster, who had been a regular at past marches about police brutality. They said his death would inspire others to join the cause, chanting, \u2018He didn\u2019t die, he multiplied!\u2019 But some worry that the incident will lead to more guns at the protests, increasing the chances of violence.\u201dThe mayors of Portland and five other major U.S. cities asked Congress to make it illegal for the federal government to deploy militarized agents to cities that don\u2019t want them. \u201cThis administration\u2019s egregious use of federal force on cities over the objections of local authorities should never happen,\u201d the mayors of Portland, Seattle, Chicago, Kansas City, Albuquerque, New Mexico, and Washington wrote in their open letter.

DeMarco, an Iraq veteran who now serves as a major in the D.C. National Guard, also casts doubt on the claims by acting Park Police Chief Gregory Monahan that violence by protesters spurred Park Police to clear the area at that time with unusually aggressive tactics. DeMarco said that \u2018demonstrators were behaving peacefully\u2019 and that tear gas was deployed in an \u2018excessive use of force.\u2019 \u201cDeMarco backs up law enforcement officials who told The Washington Post they believed the clearing operation would happen after the 7 p.m. curfew that night \u2014 but it was dramatically accelerated after [Barr] and others appeared in the park around 6 p.m. Monahan has said the operation was conducted so that a fence might be erected around the park. DeMarco said the fencing materials did not arrive until 9 p.m. \u2014 hours after Barr told the Park Police to expand the perimeter -- and the fence wasn\u2019t built until later that night. \u2026 DeMarco is scheduled to testify Tuesday before the House Natural Resources Committee, which is investigating the government\u2019s actions \u2026 \u201cAs the federal and local police waded into the protesters, DeMarco said he saw smoke being used and that he was told by a Park Police officer it was \u2018stage smoke,\u2019 not tear gas. But DeMarco said, \u2018I could feel irritation in my eyes and nose, and based on my previous exposure to tear gas in my training at West Point and later in my Army training, I recognized that irritation as effects consistent with CS or \u2018tear gas.\u2019\u2019 He said he found spent tear gas canisters on the street later.\u201dCongress has battled airlines, banks, tobacco and baseball.

But they sometimes struggled to answer pointed questions about their business practices. They also confronted a range of other concerns about alleged political bias, their effect on U.S. democracy and their role in China.ADThe four CEOs were testifying remotely to lawmakers, most of whom were sitting, in masks, inside the hearing room in Washington.ADAmong the toughest questions for Google and Amazon involved accusations that they used their dominant platforms to scoop up data about competitors in a way that gave them an unfair advantage.Bezos said in his first testimony to Congress that he couldn\u2019t guarantee that the company had not accessed seller data to make competing products, an allegation that the company and its executives have previously denied.Regulators in the U.S. and Europe have scrutinized Amazon\u2019s relationship with the businesses that sell on its site and whether the online shopping giant has been using data from the sellers to create its own private-label products.AD\u201cWe have a policy against using seller specific data to aid our private label business,\u201d Bezos said in a response to a question from U.S Rep. Pramila Jayapal, a Washington Democrat. \u201cBut I can\u2019t guarantee to you that that policy hasn\u2019t been violated.\u201dADPichai\u2019s opening remarks touted Google\u2019s value to mom-and-pop businesses in Bristol, Rhode Island and Pewaukee, Wisconsin, in the home districts of the antitrust panel\u2019s Democratic chairman, Rhode Island Rep. David Cicilline, and its ranking Republican, Rep.

Jim Jordan of Ohio.In a tweet before the hearing, President Donald Trump challenged Congress to crack down on the companies, which he has accused, without evidence, of bias against him and conservatives in general.AD\u201cIf Congress doesn\u2019t bring fairness to Big Tech, which they should have done years ago, I will do it myself with Executive Orders,\u201d Trump tweeted.Executive orders are more limited in scope than laws passed by Congress, though they too have the force of law. But presidents can\u2019t use executive orders to alter federal statutes. That takes congressional action.ADTrump\u2019s Justice Department has urged Congress to roll back long-held legal protections for online platforms such as Facebook, Google and Twitter. The proposed changes would strip some of the bedrock protections that have generally shielded the companies from legal responsibility for what people post on their platforms.ADThe four tech CEOs command corporations with gold-plated brands, millions or even billions of customers, and a combined value greater than the entire German economy. One of them, Bezos, is the world\u2019s richest individual; Zuckerberg is the fourth-ranked billionaire.Critics have questioned whether the companies stifle competition and innovation, raise prices for consumers and pose a danger to society.In its bipartisan investigation, the Judiciary subcommittee collected testimony from mid-level executives of the four firms, competitors and legal experts, and pored over more than a million internal documents from the companies. A key question: whether existing competition policies and century-old antitrust laws are adequate for overseeing the tech giants, or if new legislation and enforcement funding are needed.ADADCicilline has called the four companies monopolies, although he says breaking them up should be a last resort. While forced breakups may appear unlikely, the wide scrutiny of Big Tech points toward possible new restrictions on its power.Cicilline also said that in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, \u201cthese giants stand to profit\u201d and become even more powerful as millions shift more of their work and commerce online.The companies face legal and political offensives on multiplying fronts, from Congress, the Trump administration, federal and state regulators and European watchdogs.

According to a Pew survey of respondents in 32 countries, 64 percent of people said they had no confidence in Trump as the United States\u2019 leader. Those grim views are particularly acute in Europe, where Trump\u2019s predecessor Barack Obama was far more popular. A December 2019 YouGov poll in Germany found that Trump was perceived as a greater threat than autocrats in Moscow, Beijing and Pyongyang.These polls were conducted before the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, which has all the more soured global attitudes toward Trump\u2019s America, site of the world\u2019s single largest death toll and a sprawling, calamitous swath of infections that seemingly has no end in sight.\u201cPeople are stunned about the effect of incapable leadership, or of polarizing leadership, of not being able to unify and get the forces aligned so you can address the problem [of the coronavirus],\u201d Thomas Kleine-Brockhoff, a vice president of the German Marshall Fund and director of its Berlin office, said to my colleague Dan Balz. \u201cAnd that, of course, results in a nosedive in how you view [the United States]. What you\u2019re seeing is a collapse of soft power of America.\u201dADADThe country with soft power to spare is Germany, which has managed the coronavirus with technocratic efficiency and a degree of unity wholly absent in the United States. \u201cIts response to the pandemic,\u201d wrote Ruchir Sharma, chief global strategist at Morgan Stanley, \u201chas highlighted pre-existing strengths: efficient government, low debt, a reputation for industrial excellence that protects its exports even as global trade falls, and a growing capacity to create domestic tech companies in a world dominated by the American and Chinese internet giants.\u201dPolitical leadership is, of course, vital. \u201cWhen you read the latest results in this report on how the world rates the leadership of major global powers, the leaders who presented the case for the most certainty did the best,\u201d wrote Mohamed Younis, Gallup\u2019s editor in chief. \u201cLongtime German chancellor Angela Merkel, loved or hated, has been one of the most predictable leaders in highly uncertain times in both Europe and the global order.\u201dThat\u2019s all the more true during the pandemic, which has seen Merkel\u2019s domestic popularity surge in the twilight of her political career. \u201cThe characteristics that distinguish her have come to the fore in the pandemic, which is measured, facts-based, evidence-based, consensus-oriented leadership,\u201d Constanze Stelzenm\u00fcller, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said to my colleague Loveday Morris.ADADUnlike Trump, she adroitly navigated Germany\u2019s complex federal system, sternly pushing for stricter measures and lockdowns than some local leaders would have contemplated. \u201cGermany wouldn\u2019t have weathered it so well had she not worked very hard at buying the scenery to get all the minister presidents in line,\u201d Stelzenm\u00fcller added.As a consequence, along with the lead role she played in securing a major E.U. budget deal last week, Merkel seems set to depart the political scene with a far rosier legacy than what her critics \u2014 including Trump \u2014 predicted. \u201cIt\u2019s probably a first that after 16 years or 15 years, a chancellor has a chance to ride into a glorious sunset and not into a thunderstorm,\u201d Stefan Kornelius, Merkel\u2019s authorized biographer, told Morris.The same cannot be said for Trump, whose flailing reelection campaign has collided with a public health disaster. \u201cPeople close to Trump, many speaking anonymously to share candid discussions and impressions, say the president\u2019s inability to wholly address the crisis is due to his almost pathological unwillingness to admit error; a positive feedback loop of overly rosy assessments and data from advisers and Fox News; and a penchant for magical thinking that prevented him from fully engaging with the pandemic,\u201d my colleagues Philip Rucker and Ashley Parker reported.ADAD\u201cThe irony is that if he\u2019d just performed with minimal competence and just mouthed words about national unity, he actually could be in a pretty strong position right now, where the economy is reopening, where jobs are coming back,\u201d Ben Rhodes, a deputy national security adviser to Obama, told them. \u201cAnd he just could not do it.\u201dBeyond the pandemic, though, experts see Trump as only the catalyst for a shifting global conversation about U.S. power in the world. \u201cI think the U.S. is seen from my perspective as being involved in its own internal reckoning \u2014 like the rest of the world doesn\u2019t really exist,\u201d Robin Niblett, director and chief executive of Chatham House, a think tank in London, said to Balz. \u201cIt\u2019s America trying to battle with historical and contemporary demons that as much as anything are a result of its own internal contradictions and tensions and strengths and weaknesses.\u201d He added that Trump represented, simply, a rude awakening.\u201cWho would ever take that seriously after this?\u201d Matt Duss, foreign policy adviser to Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), told the Nation, referring to the United States\u2019 handling of the pandemic. \u201cThis idea of America as this unparalleled and supremely competent global hegemon is over.\u201dRead more: The echoes of Hong Kong in PortlandThe U.S. ramps up its confrontation with ChinaDid Europe have its \u2018Hamiltonian\u2019 moment?

Subscribe today.arrow-rightThis brings us to Sino-American relations, where the Trump administration seems bound and determined to reshape the nature of the bilateral relationship. It certainly was an eventful week. There was a diplomatic tit-for-tat, with the Trump administration forcing the closure of China\u2019s consulate in Houston and China reciprocating in Chengdu. This comes on top of new criminal sanctions against high-ranking Chinese officials and travel bans on other members of the Chinese elite.On Thursday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo delivered a stemwinder of a harangue on China, the key phrase being: \u201cPresident Reagan said that he dealt with the Soviet Union on the basis of \u2018trust but verify.\u2019 When it comes to the [Chinese Communist Party], I say we must distrust and verify.\u201d ADADPompeo called for \u201ca new alliance of democracies\u201d to respond to China. Some observers see that happening, but the secretary\u2019s rhetoric prompted the closest the foreign policy community can come to outright mockery of a sitting policy principal. Thomas Wright noted in the Atlantic that Pompeo\u2019s speech was an exercise in \u201cdoublespeak whereby he offers win-win outcomes, but his words are at odds with his actions.\u201d Richard Haass, president of the Council on Foreign Relations, blasted the speech as historically ignorant in The Washington Post, concluding: \u201cTheodore Roosevelt advised the United States to speak softly and carry a big stick. This president and his chief diplomat are perilously close to getting it backward.\u201dIronically, the trading relationship, the source of so much contention during the past three years, is the only area of the bilateral relationship that has not worsened in recent months.Surveying the diplomatic carnage, multiple observers have proffered a similar explanation: President Trump\u2019s foreign policy team, aware that the odds of a second term do not look good, are trying to exploit the time they have left in office.ADADIn The Monkey Cage, Jessica Chen Weiss and Elizabeth N. Saunders speculated that \u201chawks within the administration are directing these moves, perhaps because they see a closing window of opportunity to accelerate the decoupling in U.S.-China relations before a prospective Biden \u2018reset.\u2019\u201d The New York Times\u2019s Edward Wong and Steven Lee Myers offer a similar explanation: \u201cSome American officials, worried Mr. Trump will lose, are also trying to engineer irreversible changes, according to people familiar with the thinking.\u201d This gives rise to an important question: Can the Trump administration lock in foreign policy shifts? China is not the only concern here \u2014 others worry that the Trump team is trying something similar with Iran.Presidents can lock in foreign policy shifts, but traditionally that has happened through ratified, negotiated deals. This is a problem for Trump: Beyond his renegotiation of NAFTA, most of his foreign policy actions have been destructive rather than creative.ADADA Biden administration should be able to reverse course on a lot of this. Kurt M. Campbell and Jake Sullivan, two advisers for Joe Biden, wrote one of the better Foreign Affairs essays I have read in recent years, arguing for a new approach to China that seems \u2026 let\u2019s say \u201csaner\u201d than the current administration\u2019s approach. This suggests that change is possible under a Biden administration.Of course, the Trump administration thought it could foster warmer ties with Russia and that did not happen. Major shifts in public opinion and Congress stymied Trump on Russia.The real constraint for an incoming Biden administration would not be the Trump administration\u2019s actions, but the new Washington consensus on China. For Biden to execute a smarter pivot on China, he would have to make sure that a hawkish Congress would not hamper any policy shifts. Biden\u2019s ability to manage Democrats in Congress (as well as the party platform) will be an important variable.ADADThe real wild card is China. As I warned last year in Foreign Affairs, the Trump administration has eroded the United States\u2019 ability to credibly commit to anything. Hawks in Beijing could use U.S. inconstancy to argue that there is little point in cooperating with a Biden administration if it is replaced by a Cotton administration in 2025.So \u2026 what does China want? This is the known unknown and it could go either way. Weiss told the New York Times that with \u201cglobal anti-China sentiment at its highest level in decades, Chinese officials have indicated an interest in exploring potential offramps to the current death spiral in U.S.-China relations.\u201d But there have also been some serious outbreaks of \u201cwolf warrior diplomacy\u201d over the past six months. China escalated tensions with India and other neighbors all on its own.Paradoxically, for a Biden administration to persuade China to adopt a less confrontational approach, it would need to repair the carnage wreaked by the Trump administration\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d approach toward allies. The more that Beijing views Biden as the leader of a large coalition and less like a unilateralist, the more likely it will be prepared to parley.If Trump is really trying to sabotage his successor\u2019s standing in the world, he\u2019ll do it not only by promoting a new Cold War with China, but also by further corroding U.S. alliances. That, far more than confrontation with China, is what will keep me uneasy for the next six months.", "comment": "8 Comments", "topic": "PostEverything"}, {"cover": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/P2OJW2WQ7EI6VDCVMHT7UXUCVM.jpghttps://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/P2OJW2WQ7EI6VDCVMHT7UXUCVM.jpg", "title": "The long fights \u2014 and hasty decisions \u2014 that shape immigration policy", "date": "Jul 31, 2020", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/the-long-fights--and-hasty-decisions--that-shape-immigration-policy/2020/07/30/183a91c8-c524-11ea-a99f-3bbdffb1af38_story.html", "keyword": "China and the world order", "website": "the Washington Post", "author": "", "content": "The Supreme Court this summer issued two major immigration rulings: one temporarily blocking the Trump administration\u2019s quest to end Obama-era protections for young undocumented immigrants, the other allowing the administration to speed up deportations of people whose asylum claims have been denied.

Subscribe today.arrow-rightThrough distinct lenses, two new books underscore this long-standing tension between Congress and the executive branch and, on a deeper level, the United States\u2019 conflicted relationship with its identity as a nation of immigrants. In \u201cOne Mighty and Irresistible Tide: The Epic Struggle Over American Immigration, 1924-1965,\u201d Jia Lynn Yang pans wide across the often overlooked 40-year battle to overhaul racist and restrictive immigration laws passed in the early 20th century. The book culminates in the passage of the 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act, or the Hart-Celler Act, which Yang credits for her own family\u2019s immigration to the United States from Taiwan and China \u2014 and which has become the bedrock of our current immigration system.In \u201cSeparated: Inside an American Tragedy,\u201d Jacob Soboroff zooms in on President Trump and his administration\u2019s decision to separate children from their parents as a deterrent to border crossers. In doing so, he illuminates how, in the face of congressional inaction, a cadre of presidential advisers can introduce policies with shocking, unintended consequences.ADADMuch has been written in recent years about the 1965 immigration law, which prioritized family-linked visas and ended the national-origins quotas favoring White Northern Europeans. But Yang, deputy national editor at the New York Times and a former Washington Post editor, digs into the tectonic geopolitical shifts that led to the law\u2019s passage. Along the way, she reminds her audience that the current president\u2019s divisive and at times racist, anti-immigrant rhetoric is hardly an outlier in American history.While a Broadway-bound play, \u201cThe Melting Pot,\u201d opened in D.C. in 1908 to applause from none other than President Theodore Roosevelt, a little more than a decade later, Yang reminds us, prominent lawmakers in Washington were calling the phrase obsolete. \u201cWe no longer are to be a haven, a refuge, for oppressed the whole world over. We found we could not be . . . and America will cease to become a melting pot,\u201d declared Sen. David A. Reed of Pennsylvania shortly before the passage of the 1924 immigration law that bears his name. The law shut the door on immigration from Japan, the last Asian country whose citizens could still receive U.S. visas, and it slashed immigration from Southern and Eastern Europe for several decades.Congress\u2019s actions carried weight across the Atlantic, where Yang describes a young Adolf Hitler heaping praise on the United States for barring \u201cthe immigration of physically unhealthy elements\u201d and \u201ccertain races.\u201dEven the 1965 reform and its focus on family connections over skill sets were due in part to a core group of lawmakers who believed that the law would favor the country\u2019s historic Northern European stream over newer influxes from Africa, Asia and other parts of the world.Yang sketches lively portraits of the famous and obscure players behind the legislative fights, like Rep. Emanuel Celler, a freshman congressman who came to Washington from Brooklyn in 1923 and found himself a \u201clost soul,\u201d aching for his wife and baby daughter, but who, like a number of Jewish lawmakers and advocates, became a stalwart defender of postwar refugees and other immigrants. Then there was Takao Ozawa, who arrived in the United States at 19 and petitioned unsuccessfully for the right of Japanese immigrants like himself to become U.S. citizens, arguing in 1915: \u201cIn name, General Benedict Arnold was an American, but at heart he was a traitor. In name, I am not an American, but at heart I am a true American.\u201dADADThe book underscores how many of the nearly century-old debates over our immigration system remain in play: whether the country should prioritize immigrants with high-demand skills over those with family; whether championing immigrants comes at the expense of working-class Americans; the way immigrants are often pushed to \u201cclimb the social ladder\u201d by acquiring \u201cwhiteness\u201d and distancing from African Americans; and more broadly, whether our nation will cling to its Anglo-European roots or more fully embrace its growing diversity.At times, the details of the backroom negotiations become mind-numbing. And one is reminded why even historians often shed all but a few protagonists in service of a tight and linear narrative. Yet Yang\u2019s voyage across early-20th-century U.S. immigration debates makes palpable how much diplomacy and perseverance are required to win legislative change. That it took the United States 40 years to throw out the majority of its most-racist immigration policies and modernize its system might offer some hope to those who have been fighting nearly as long to overhaul the latest incarnation of this law.The 1965 law had another legacy: the first limits on immigration from Latin America. In  \u201cSeparated,\u201d Soboroff, an NBC and MSNBC correspondent, zeros in on the resulting influx of undocumented immigrants across the southern border and, in the absence of congressional action, the Trump administration\u2019s response: a hastily developed policy of separating parents and children without a plan for tracking and reuniting them.ADADAlthough such separations had been carried out occasionally under previous administrations, Soboroff describes how, only weeks after Trump\u2019s inauguration, officials began discussing whether to implement the tactic on a widespread level. The idea was that immigrants crossing illegally, and even some who presented themselves at official points of entry, could immediately be detained and potentially prosecuted for criminal entry, while their children would be whisked away hundreds or thousands of miles to shelters normally reserved for unaccompanied minors.Soboroff quotes one Health and Human Services staffer\u2019s email from late September 2017, criticizing the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s operations. \u201cThey don\u2019t understand .\u2009.\u2009. these types of cases often end with parent repatriated and kid in our care for months pending home studies, international legal issues, etc.\u201dBut they did understand, Soboroff insists. Many parents, who often couldn\u2019t read the English forms they were given, would sign over their rights to seek asylum and to reunite with their children in the United States, while the children wondered why their parents had abandoned them.ADADWith the immediacy of cable news, Soboroff attempts to reconstruct the quiet run-up to the public acknowledgment of the policy, including one official\u2019s efforts to destroy the internal list of separated parents and children. He interweaves this reporting with his own on-the-ground work as one of the first journalists to enter detention facilities holding the separated children. And he follows Juan and Jos\u00e9, a Guatemalan father and son seeking asylum who are swept into the maw of the separation machine.\u201cThis place is called a shelter, but effectively these kids are incarcerated,\u201d a stunned Soboroff tells his MSNBC colleague, anchor Chris Hayes, in June 2018, moments after witnessing some 1,500 boys being held in a converted former Walmart.Soboroff, who acknowledges that he came to the story late, offers generous recognition to fellow journalists and the advocates who saw the looming crisis well before he did \u2014 though an index and detailed endnotes would have made it easier to keep track of their findings and given the book a heftier feel. Ultimately, the reporter is the protagonist, providing the book\u2019s strength and emotional core, but also at times making it seem overly self-referential.ADADTrump signed an order to officially end the mass family separations in late June 2018, following a public outcry, though it\u2019s unclear how many children remain separated \u2014 in large part because of poor record-keeping. Meanwhile, the administration has sought to replace the program with longer family detentions and to cut down on those even permitted to apply for asylum.Congress is unlikely to act on immigration in the remaining months of this election cycle. And the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to fast-track the deportation of asylum seekers means people like Juan and Jos\u00e9 could easily be sent back to their countries before lawmakers ever step in. A lasting solution to the crisis at the border must come from Congress and will probably be as hard-won this time as it was in the 20th century. As both Soboroff and Yang demonstrate, it will inevitably require a reckoning with both the history and the present story we tell ourselves about America being a nation of immigrants. \u201cLike any myth,\u201d Yang writes, \u201cthe idea easily goes unexamined \u2014 exalted and treated as if it were a divine, immutable basis for this country\u2019s existence, when it is the work of human beings, easily erased by other human beings.\u201d", "comment": "4 Comments", "topic": "Outlook"}, {"cover": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/5HDMNDWNHMI6VGNQQQTOE3JAHM.jpghttps://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/5HDMNDWNHMI6VGNQQQTOE3JAHM.jpg", "title": "The Daily 202: As U.S. economy careens toward coronavirus cliffs, Trump looks to give FBI a new building near his hotel", "date": "Jul 24, 2020", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/07/24/daily-202-us-economy-careens-toward-coronavirus-cliffs-trump-looks-give-fbi-new-building-near-his-hotel/", "keyword": "China and the world order", "website": "the Washington Post", "author": "James Hohmann", "content": "with Mariana AlfaroA federal moratorium that has protected an estimated 12 million renters from being evicted since March expires at midnight and has not been renewed.Support our journalism.

The number of new unemployment claims rose last week for the first time since March, increasing to 1.4 million from 1.3 million the week before.More people are poised to lose work as money received from federal loans under the Paycheck Protection Program runs out.\u00a0Unpaid electric and water bills are driving families and local governments to the brink of insolvency.ADEnhanced federal unemployment benefits that have allowed tens of millions of Americans to make ends meet since the spring are due to expire at the end of next week.ADSenate Republicans left town Thursday for a three-day weekend without unveiling their proposal for the next phase of coronavirus relief. They want to continue the expanded benefits at $200 per week, instead of the current $600, but there will be no extension at all without legislative action. Economists across the ideological spectrum agree that inaction would both worsen and prolong the recession.Amid the cascading crises buffeting the country, one of the complications holding up the GOP\u2019s release of their counteroffer to the bill that House Democrats previously passed had nothing to do with the contagion: The White House is pushing to include language related to the location of the FBI's headquarters.This is just the latest example of President Trump appearing not to have his eye on the ball.The FBI building is catty-corner from the Trump International Hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue NW. \u201cTrump has expressed interest in the location of the FBI\u2019s headquarters for some time,\u201d Erica Werner, Seung Min Kim and Jeff Stein report. \u201cThe details were unclear, but the Trump administration previously scrapped a plan to move the FBI headquarters to the suburbs, instead seeking to rebuild a new FBI building in its current location.\u201d\u00a0ADADDuring his daily coronavirus news conference on Thursday evening, Trump defended his push to keep the FBI based where it is now and to give the agency a new state-of-the-art building. Left unsaid was that this could raise property values and help put more potential customers next to his personal business. But he also suggested that he will not demand that it happen in this must-pass legislation.\u00a0\u201cThis one is very old, and \u2026 it was never built to a very high standard,\u201d Trump said of the FBI building. \u201cFrankly, you have to be near the Justice Department. There's nothing better than the site. \u2026 They were looking at sites in Maryland and Virginia, in different places, but they would\u2019ve been too far away. So I am, I've been, encouraging them to build it.\u201d\u201cBecause FBI people like to work out a lot,\u201d Trump said, a new facility at the current site could include quarter-mile running tracks on the roof. \u201cYou can renovate the existing building \u2026 or you could take it down and build a great building for the FBI for 100 years and have it be incredible,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I think \u2026 the best idea would be to build a new building. \u2026 I know they're talking about it, whether or not they put it in this bill or someplace else, but the FBI needs a new building, and we'll get it done.\u201dADADRepublicans had hoped to unveil the text of a plan that they could agree to on Wednesday, but the process has proven contentious within the conference. \u201cSensing the potential economic calamity of pulling back these (unemployment) benefits for up to 30 million people all at once, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin suggested Congress consider a smaller bill to keep these benefits in place while other details are negotiated on Capitol Hill. But Democrats and Republicans roundly dismissed that idea immediately,\u201d per Erica, Seung Min and Jeff.\u00a0The GOP\u2019s new goal is to unveil a proposal on Monday. In a floor speech, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said what they eventually put out would include a new round of stimulus checks, aid for schools, money for testing, changes to unemployment assistance rules, more money for small businesses and legal protections to make it hard for people to sue their employers if they become sick after being called back to work. A new round of funding for the Paycheck Protection Program is also expected.The pandemic has outlasted the PPP.\u201cThe phone stopped ringing at the Nelsons\u2019 auto-body shop in Broomfield, Colo., in March,\u201d Eli Rosenberg reports. \u201cThe normal four-to-six-week wait for customers looking to have dents or bumps fixed on their cars disappeared, leaving the shop silent. Tammy Nelson and her husband, Scott, applied in April for a loan from \u2026 the federal government\u2019s chaotic $660 billion aid program meant to help businesses and their workers stay afloat. But the PPP loan had only delayed the inevitable \u2014 the phone didn\u2019t start ringing again amid the surging pandemic. Nelson laid off her five employees at the end of June, including herself and her husband.\u00a0 \u2026 \u2018It was just a Band-Aid on a bullet wound,\u2019 Nelson said of the PPP. \u2018All it really did was prolong the agony of having our workers file for unemployment. Whether it\u2019s April 15 or June 30, the end result is still the same.\u2019 \u2026ADAD\u201cAlthough there\u2019s no official tally on numbers of layoffs tied to companies whose PPP funding is expiring, the National Federation of Independent Business, a trade association for small businesses, found that 22 percent of PPP recipients surveyed have laid off or expect to lay off employees after using up their PPP loan \u2026 In recent weeks, layoffs have been reported at the Buffalo-based New Era Cap Co., which received $5 million to $10 million; Peoria Charter Coach, a bus travel company that laid of 132 workers \u2014 95 percent of its workforce \u2014 after using up the $1 million to $2 million PPP loan; at least a dozen museums including National September 11 Memorial and Museum and the Philadelphia Museum of Art; and Rosen Hotels & Resorts, a Florida-based hotel company that received a loan of between $2 million and $5 million. \u2026 The program\u2019s terms were originally slated to last eight weeks and was expanded to 24 weeks, although it was left up to companies whether to use the expansion.\u201dOf the 110 million Americans living in rental households, 20 percent are at risk of eviction by Sept. 30.That is according to an analysis by the Covid-19 Eviction Defense Project, a Colorado-based community group. \u201cAfrican American and Hispanic renters are expected to be hit hardest,\u201d Renae Merle reports. \u201cCongress passed a national moratorium that has shielded about one-third of renters from eviction since late March. The renters protected under this moratorium live in buildings or homes with a mortgage that has some form of government backing. That moratorium expires Friday, but renters still have a little time. Once the ban ends, landlords are required to give renters 30 days\u2019 notice before filing an eviction complaint in court. That means the eviction paperwork won\u2019t be filed until late August. Some renters are also covered by a patchwork of state and local eviction bans that don\u2019t end until August or September.\u201dADADHouse Democrats proposed $100 billion in rental assistance, but Senate Republicans have said they will not include this in their proposal.Princeton University\u2019s Eviction Lab maintains a Covid-19 Housing Policy Scorecard that includes some helpful information about local moratoriums.Ivanka Trump\u2019s Find Something New career campaign is more hype than help.The White House adviser\u2019s initiative has been a ballyhooed centerpiece of her dad\u2019s efforts to assist the unemployed. \u201cPeople who\u2019ve lost their jobs because of the coronavirus don\u2019t need a new website. They need better guidance,\u201d writes financial columnist Michelle Singletary. \u201cThe site is glitzy and gimmicky, but hardly amazing. \u2026 And despite the claim that FindSomethingNew.org will offer people an alternative path from two- and four-year colleges, many of the offerings require just that \u2014 an associate degree or a fair amount of technical training or coursework.\u201dAmerica just cannot catch a break: Opening Day was rained out.\u201cThe first game of baseball\u2019s return didn\u2019t end with a walk-off hit, a high-pressure strikeout or any players on the field at Nationals Park. That would have been far too off-brand for 2020. Instead, on a rain-soaked Thursday in the District, the final pitch was thrown by Max Scherzer with one out in the sixth. The last sequence was the ace and his teammates jogging for cover beneath a violent midsummer storm. The New York Yankees led at that point, 4-1, and that held as the final result,\u201d Jesse Dougherty and Scott Allen report. \u201cIt took months of labor negotiations and continued health scares to begin a 60-game season \u2026 So of course, on a night that was supposed to finally feature the sport, only the actual game was washed away. The action lasted 1 hour 43 minutes. The rain delay was 15 minutes longer.\u201dMore on the coronavirusThe rate of new infections has doubled.\u00a0\u201cThe rapid spread of the virus this summer is striking, taking just 15 days to go from 3 million confirmed cases to 4 million. By comparison, the increase from 1 million cases to 2 million spanned 45 days from April 28 to June 11, and the leap to 3 million then took 27 days,\u201d Anne Gearan, Marisa Iati and Jacqueline Dupree report. \u201cThe rolling seven-day average of infections has doubled in less than a month, reaching more than 66,000 new cases per day Wednesday. The U.S. death toll now exceeds 141,000.\"The president retreated from his demands to hold a large in-person convention.\u201cTrump on Thursday abruptly canceled the Republican National Convention celebrations scheduled for next month in Jacksonville, Fla.,\u201d Michael Scherer, Josh Dawsey and Colby Itkowitz report.\u00a0\u201cTrump has for months instructed his advisers to find a way to stage a loud, boisterous and packed convention celebration, after North Carolina officials said they could not guarantee such an event in Charlotte. \u2026 The president\u2019s ambition, however, ran headlong into a massive spike in coronavirus cases in Florida, growing local opposition and enormous logistical hurdles. At one point, convention planners announced they would administer daily coronavirus tests to thousands of delegates, donors and members of the media to help reduce the viral risk. That plan was later scrapped to move large portions of the celebrations to an outdoor venue. \u2026ADAD\u201cTrump advisers have repeatedly argued to him in recent days that a more cautious approach is likely to boost his popularity. Canceling the convention, they said, would also show he is taking the virus seriously. \u2026 Some White House and campaign officials were fearful of the negative press if delegates and others were infected \u2026 They also came to the conclusion that they would probably have to use the National Guard to protect the convention from protests and allow for distancing in the crowd. The president, advisers said, was less than enthusiastic about an arena or stadium that appeared less than full.\u201d (Many GOP lawmakers have said they would not attend. During his news conference, Trump also walked back a little from his insistence that schools should open on time this fall.)\u201cA Quinnipiac University poll released Thursday found 62 percent of Florida voters opposed holding the convention. Sheriff Mike Williams announced this week that he did not have the resources to provide adequate security for the event. \u2026 The city council presented yet another obstacle to the Republican plans. Just minutes before Trump\u2019s announcement, the Republican Party of Duval County sent an email asking party members to \u2018call your councilmember and tell them to support\u2019 the convention.\u201dReminder: Trump has repeatedly mocked Democrats for signaling early that they would respect public health guidance to scale back on their convention festivities. Democrats will hold a four-day convention in August that will be anchored in Milwaukee, with simulcasts from satellite locations across the country and prerecorded video. But delegates and party officials have been urged to stay home, and the in-person crowd for major speeches, including Joe Biden\u2019s acceptance of the nomination, will be small.ADADEarlier this week, Trump boasted that his administration has met most governors' requests for supplies. That's not true. Officials in Oregon, Indiana, Georgia, New Hampshire, Alaska, Montana, Wyoming, North Carolina, Maryland, Michigan, Idaho, Utah and Washington told ABC News they are either still waiting for requests to be fulfilled, had identified orders that were never filled or have made requests they understand are still being processed.Trump is expected to sign three health-care executive orders today, including two that target the pharmaceutical industry on drug pricing. White House aides spent much of yesterday fielding calls from drug company executives expressing frustration with the orders, which come as the administration pushes the industry to develop and manufacture covid-19 vaccines.

The unusual admission, contained in a court filing, said the inaccuracies \u2018undermine a central argument\u2019 in the Trump administration\u2019s case for barring New Yorkers from the programs after the state passed a law enabling undocumented immigrants to get driver\u2019s licenses,\u201d the New York Times reports. \u201cFederal officials had previously insisted that New York was an outlier in the restrictions it placed on the access the immigration authorities have to State Department of Motor Vehicles records. \u2026 But in their filing on Thursday, the government lawyers acknowledged that several other states, Washington, D.C., and some U.S. territories also limited access to motor vehicle information and had not been subject to similar clampdowns.\u00a0\u201cAgainst that backdrop, the filing said, \u2018The acting secretary of homeland security has decided to restore New York residents\u2019 access to\u2019 what is officially known as the Trusted Traveler Program \u2018effective immediately.\u2019 \u2026 \u2018Defendants deeply regret the foregoing inaccurate or misleading statements and apologize to the court and plaintiffs for the need to make these corrections at this late stage in the litigation,\u2019 said Audrey Strauss, the acting United States attorney in Manhattan. \u2026\u00a0\u201cOn Feb. 4, Mr. Trump criticized New York in his State of the Union address for not letting the police detain undocumented immigrants until federal agents could pick them up for deportation proceedings \u2026 The next day, Chad F. Wolf, the acting homeland security secretary and a favorite of Mr. Trump\u2019s for his hard-line stance on enforcement matters, said on Fox News that New Yorkers would be barred from the travel programs because of the sanctuary policies. At the time, Gov. Andrew M.

GriffithsIt\u2019s Thursday. We\u2019re almost there! Happy Major League Baseball-ing. Tips, comments, recipes? Reach out and sign up.Support our journalism. Subscribe today.arrow-rightThe PeopleWHAT'S OLD IS NEW AGAIN: Government-ordered mask mandates are sweeping the country as facial coverings have emerged as a powerful tool to curb the spread of the novel coronavirus.\u00a0More than half of U.S. states now require people to wear face coverings in public places, including many Republican governors who were resistant to the idea but softened as cases spiked \u2014 the case in Ohio and Indiana this week.\u00a0And some local officials are ordering fines on those who break mask rules in their cities or counties despite opposition from Republican governors in states such as Nebraska, Iowa and Florida. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp (R) is going so far as to sue Atlanta's Democratic mayor over her mask mandate.\u00a0But for all the controversy \u2014 and pockets of protests against mask-wearing across the country \u2014 the debate over mask mandates and how to enforce them was also a huge issue more than a century ago, when the 1918 influenza pandemic killed 675,000 people in the U.S. and caused an estimated 50 million deaths worldwide. Those who did not comply with mask rules faced fines, public shaming or even prison.\u00a0ADADToday, fines can be steep: The District of Columbia just issued one of the strictest ordinances in the country, requiring people older than 2 to wear a mask when they leave the house and are likely to come into contact with others \u2014 or any adult could risk a fine of up to $1,000.\u00a0And in Florida's Miami-Dade County, for example, you can be fined $100 to $500 for not wearing a mask in public. Thirty-nine law enforcement officers will be assigned to enforcing the mandate, Miami Mayor Francis Suarez (R) announced on Tuesday.Fines were quite steep back then, too: \u201cAmong the most stringent mask cities was San Francisco, which at the end of October 1918 made mask-wearing mandatory. Penalties ranged from a fine of $5 to $100 to imprisonment for 10\u00a0days,\u201d The Post's John Kelly writes. In today's dollars, that's a fine range of about $85 to more than $1,700. And they were strictly enforced: The Oakland, Calif., mayor in 1919 was arrested in the lobby of a Sacramento hotel the following year for failing to properly wear his mask: He was fined $5 for wearing his mask hanging to his ear while he smoked a cigar.\u00a0ADADSo were penalties for other coronavirus rules: In the city of West Palm Beach, violations of an ordinance that closed all public meetings and gatherings of any kind until the flu had passed carried a fine of \u201c$100 fine or 30 days in jail. In 1918, $100 carried the purchasing power of $1,762 today,\u201d according to the Palm Beach Post's John Pacenti.\u00a0The rules, then as now, brought blowback: A constituency of \u201cmask-slackers,\u201d as they were referred to at the time, refused to abide by the adopted mask ordinances in various cities. San Francisco faced a particularly robust \u201cAnti Mask League\u201d that formed in January of 1919.\u00a0Not dissimilar to today's culture war, 1918's mask slackers viewed mask mandates as a threat to personal freedom: \u201cA week ago I laughed at the idea of the mask,\u201d local Red Cross Chairman John A. Britton told a reporter from the San Francisco Chronicle at the time. \u201cI wanted to be independent. I did not realize that the cost of such independence was the lives of others.\u201d\u00a0A window into their beliefs: \u201cJohn Raggi, arrested on Columbus Avenue, said he did not wear a mask because he did not believe in masks or ordinances, or even jail,\u201d The Chronicle reported. \u201cHe now has no occasion to disbelieve in jails. He is in the city prison.\u201d\u00a0There were messaging campaigns urging people to protect themselves and others through the use of masks and newspapers printed instructions on D.I.Y. facial coverings. Americans were advised to kiss through handkerchiefs and spitting in streets became taboo.\u00a0Disputes over mask orders even erupted in violence at times. In cities that opened and then had to re-close due to a resurgence of the virus, resistance to public health guidance ran especially high, according to historian John Barry and author of \u201cThe Great Influenza: The Story of the Deadliest Pandemic in History.\u201dADADPart of this was fueled by the end of World War I in November 1918: \u201cThen you got pushback on basically everything, not just masks,\u201d Barry told Power Up. \u201cPeople thought they had escaped, they were free, the war had ended adding a level of exuberance and you were told, nun-uh, you gotta go back in the box and people didn\u2019t like that too much.\u201d\u00a0It didn't help matters that President Woodrow Wilson never once spoke publicly about the flu, according to Barry, even as it tore through the country.\u00a0Wilson, as Barry told the New Yorker's Steve Coll, was so singularly focused on the war mobilization that he had \u201cfurious intolerance\u201d for any other subject of governance including containing the flu, and suppressed dissent in the country in ways that \u201cwent beyond anything seen in the McCarthy period or any other time\u201d: \u201cMuch like [President] Trump, he did not tolerate criticism from friend or foe. Even if a friend evidenced any distance from him, he exiled that person,\u201d Barry said.\u201cAll this makes Wilson\u2019s complete silence on the pandemic understandable in only one context: he would do nothing to distract him or the nation from the war effort. His focus was absolute \u2014 there was the war, and nothing else.\u201d\u00a0There was even a Dr. Anthony Fauci figure in the 1918 pandemic \u2014 a health expert who made enemies over his unpopular recommendations to stop the spread of the 1918 flu. Dr. Thomas Dyer Tuttle served as heath commissioner in Washington State before he eventually lost his job over unpopular measures he recommended to stop the 1918 flu., according to Forbes's Alex Knapp.\u00a0But Tuttle's efforts still have resonance today: \u201cIn 2009, a group of researchers wrote a paper comparing existing CDC guidelines on managing pandemics to those developed during the 1918 flu.,\u201d Knapp reports. \u201cThe paper noted that of all the recommendations, measures Dr. Tuttle promoted \u2014 encouraging the closing of public spaces and social distancing \u2014 were still relevant in fighting epidemics today. The report even cited findings from the 1918 December meeting Dr. Tuttle attended before insisting on the draconian health measures that got him fired.\u201d\u00a0The resistance is male: President Trump, who has declined to issue a national mask mandate, is now trying to sell mask wearing as an act of patriotism \u2014 six months into the pandemic which has claimed the lives of 140,000 people in the U.S.\u00a0ADPreviously, Trump mocked facial coverings and suggested they were a sign of personal weakness. Viewing masks as a threat to masculinity also appears to be a timeless attitude, apparently, as men in 1918 also needed more convincing than women did to wear masks, according to Business Insider's Katie Canales.\u00a0AD\u201cSome men associated masks with femininity, and behaviors like spitting, careless coughing, and otherwise dismissal of hygiene made men the \u2018weak links in hygienic discipline\u2019 during the 1918 pandemic, according to a 2010 report published in the US National Library of Medicine,\u201d per Canales. \u201cSo public health leaders rebranded personal care as a display of patriotism and duty to incentivize men to wear masks.\u201d\u00a0Perhaps also taking a cue from 1918, Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine (R) accompanied his statewide mask order with a new ad campaign, emphasizing the importance of wearing a mask with a life or death message:\u00a0\u201cReally, the message is that you wear the mask for other people. You wear the mask to protect your grandmother. It\u2019s not just the orders,\u201d DeWine told NBC News's Chuck Todd last week. \u201cThe orders are obviously important, but getting people to buy in and to understand \u2014 getting a 20-year-old to understand \u2014 he or she may feel invulnerable, nothing is going to happen to them, but they may get it, they may not know they have it, they may go home and see their grandmother, she may get it and she may end up dying. That\u2019s the message that we\u2019re trying to get out across the state of Ohio.\u201d\u00a0New York Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo (D) also launched a national ad campaign last week. Actor Morgan Freeman is featured in one of the ads: \u201cWhen you wear a mask, you have my respect,\u201d he says. \u201cBecause your mask doesn\u2019t protect you, it protects me \u2026 I wear my mask to protect you. Be New York tough.

As part of this, senators agreed to $16 billion for testing and tracing \u2014 down from the $25 billion they had initially sought \u2014 after administration officials argued that $9 billion remained unspent in a federal fund. Administration officials had initially sought to zero out the testing funding.\u201dREPUBLICANS SQUABBLE AS TRUMP SINKS: \u201cTensions among congressional Republicans fueled by the party\u2019s diminishing electoral fortunes broke out into the open this week \u2014 as GOP lawmakers sparred over the shape of the next coronavirus aid package, how vigorously to stand behind [Trump] and which primaries to wade into that could help determine control of the Senate in November,\u201d Seung Min Kim and Rachael Bade report.The thread that ties it all together: \u201cThe battles this week were a microcosm of the broader reckoning over the party\u2019s future and how strong the populist tenets of Trumpism will hold after the president leaves office. The fractures are emerging now because of worries that the party faces doom at the polls this fall owing to Trump\u2019s handling of the pandemic and his resulting falling poll numbers against presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden,\u201d our colleagues write.Global PowerCHINA VOWS TO RETALIATE OVER CONSULATE CLOSURE: \u201cThe United States abruptly ordered China to close its consulate in Houston by Friday, striking at what U.S. officials described as an espionage hub for Beijing and sending relations between the world's two biggest political and economic powers to a new low,\u201d Anna Fifield, Carol Morello, Ellen Nakashima and Shane Harris report.Beijing's response: \"China immediately promised to retaliate for the \u2018unprecedented escalation,\u2019 raising the specter of a tit-for-tat battle that could prompt Beijing to shutter at least one U.S. consulate soon and adopt more punitive measures later.\"Analysts on both sides say relations between the world's two largest economies is their worst since 1979: \u201cAfter the news broke, a phrase that Mao Zedong, who established the communist-run People\u2019s Republic of China, wrote in 1949 about the China-U.S. relationship began trending on the Chinese Internet: \u2018Cast Away Illusions, Prepare for Struggle.\u2019\u201d", "comment": "0 Comments", "topic": "PowerPost"}, {"cover": "", "title": "Starbucks says it sees better times ahead as stores reopen", "date": "Jul 28, 2020", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/starbucks-seeing-recovery-as-global-stores-reopen/2020/07/28/e65a5984-d114-11ea-826b-cc394d824e35_story.html", "keyword": "China and the world order", "website": "the Washington Post", "author": "", "content": "Starbucks\u2019 revenue shrank 38% in its most recent quarter but the coffee giant says it\u2019s recovering faster than expected as its stores reopen from coronavirus lockdowns.The Seattle-based company said Tuesday that it expects coronavirus-related losses to ease through the rest of this year.Support our journalism.

Among other concerns, amid a sputtering economic rebound, another downturn could force more businesses to shut their doors, and \u201cthe impact on the on the economy is not necessarily going to be \u2018one and one equals two.\u2019 There could very well be a nonlinear impact this time around.\u201dLeading economists say after extending unemployment benefits, funding for state and local governments presents the most urgent need.In a survey of 33 top economists by FiveThirtyEight and the Initiative on Global Markets at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, 85 percent said the aid should be a top-three priority for policymakers crafting the relief package. And 36 percent said it should be the top priority. Via FiveThirtyEight:\u00a0Yet the proposal Senate Republicans are forging isn\u2019t set to include new relief for state and local governments. Instead, the lawmakers appear likely to give governors and local officials more flexibility in directing the $150 billion that has already been allocated.ADADState and local leaders say it's not nearly enough and are pushing Congress for $500 to $1 trillion in new help. House Democrats included $1 trillion for them in the relief package they passed in May. And Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.) has coauthored a bipartisan proposal to send $500 billion in new support to state and local governments. But many of his colleagues object, in part over concerns about the price tag.Governments beyond the Beltway are getting squeezed from two directions: The economic freeze has choked off tax revenue, just as they face higher costs to support those dislocated by the downturn and respond to the public health crisis itself. Unlike the federal government, nearly all are required to balance their budgets, meaning funding shortfalls will force spending cuts. And those could have a macroeconomic effect, considering the contribution local governments make to overall economic activity.\u201cCollectively, state and local governments outspend Washington on direct goods and services, employ more workers than the domestic manufacturing sector, and are responsible for about 11 percent of national GDP,\u201d Anshu Siripurapu and Jonathan Masters of the Council on Foreign Relations recently wrote.Housing advocates are raising alarms about the sunset of an eviction ban.\u201cThe moratorium covers renters who live in homes with federally backed mortgages, which the Urban Institute\u00a0estimates\u00a0to be 12.3 million households, or about 30 percent of all renters nationwide,\u201d Renae Merle reports. \u201cOnce the moratorium lapses, landlords can give their delinquent tenants 30 days\u2019 notice and then begin filing eviction paperwork in late August.\u201dSome 96 percent of renters made their June payments, roughly matching the same month last year, according to the National Multifamily House Council.ADADBut housing advocates worry that number could plummet if the weekly $600 payments in federal unemployment benefits dry up, delivering a gut-punch to millions of lower-income people who have lost their jobs. \u201cWe are looking at an eviction cliff, and once we fall over it, it will be hard to climb back,\u201d National Housing Conference president David Dworkin tells Renae.Providing more funding for the PPP presents a rare point of agreement.McConnell and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin both support extending the lending program for small businesses. McConnell wants to tweak its terms to \u201cmore closely target troubled businesses,\u201d the Wall Street Journal\u2019s Andrew Duehren reports. \u201cSen. Marco Rubio (R., Fla.), who leads the Senate Small Business Committee, said that effort will involve both repurposing leftover PPP funds and likely appropriating additional ones.\u201dADADBut little is fixed as Republicans spent Tuesday sparring over the proposal\u2019s basics. \u201cThe Republican and White House positions changed multiple times as the day went on,\u201d Erica, Jeff and Seung Min report.\u201cComplicating matters, other Republican lawmakers appeared mortified about the growing size of the spending bill, leading to bickering over which policies to remove and warning that miscalculations could allow Democrats to seize control of the White House and the Senate in November,\u201d they write.\u00a0\u201cThe whole process now appears likely to spill into August, something the White House and congressional Democrats had hoped to avoid, because it would mean more than 20 million Americans would lose emergency unemployment benefits when they expire at the end of this month. They have not mapped out a plan for what would happen to these people as the pandemic\u2019s turmoil continues to weigh on the U.S. economy.\u201dMarket moversDow pulls out 150-point gain.But tech stocks drag down Nasdaq: \u201cThe Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 closed higher on Tuesday as traders booked profits from the major tech names and added to positions in the more beaten-down value stocks,\u201d CNBC's Fred Imbert and Yun Li report.ADAD\u201cThe 30-stock Dow gained 159.53 points, or 0.6 percent, to close at 26,840.40.

The true number of cases on the continent of 1.3 billion people is unknown because of testing shortages and insufficient data.The World Health Organization has said more than 10,000 health workers in Africa have been infected, many of them nurses, further challenging efforts to contain the virus spread.___HANOI, Vietnam \u2014 Vietnam on Sunday reimposed restrictions in one of its most popular beach destinations after a second person tested positive for COVID-19, the first locally transmitted cases in the country in over three months.Da Nang authorities in central Vietnam banned gatherings of more than 30 people in public places as well as all sport, cultural and religious events in the city of 1.1 million. Theme parks, beauty salons, bars and clubs were also ordered shut.People were advised to practice social distancing, wear masks and wash hands regularly.On Sunday, a 61-year-old man was confirmed to be infected, a day after a 57-year-old tested positive for the coronavirus. Both are in critical condition and require life support.A team of doctors who successfully cured a British pilot from COVID-19 flew to Da Nang to direct the treatment of the two patients.Health workers, however, have not been able to establish a connection between the two men, nor trace the source of infection. It\u2019s reported that for the last month, they did not travel out of the city, where there\u2019s been no case of COVID-19 since April.___BEIJING \u2014 China reported 46 new COVID-19 cases on Sunday, the highest daily tally in more than a month, as it took steps to stem recent outbreaks that have infected more than 160 people at opposite ends of the country.Authorities confirmed 22 cases in Urumqi, a city in the Xinjiang region in the country\u2019s far west, the official Xinhua News Agency said. That raised the total in the local outbreak to 137 since the first case was detected 10 days ago.Another 13 cases were confirmed in Liaoning province in the northeast, bringing the total there to 25, almost all in the city of Dalian.The National Health Commission also reported 11 imported cases in the latest 24-hour period, in people who had arrived from overseas.China has recorded 83,830 cases and 4,634 deaths since the pandemic began.

They equip themselves with makeshift protective gear, donning bicycle helmets, gas masks and goggles while wielding umbrellas as shields. Some have repurposed household tools like leafblowers to help against tear gas and other projectiles fired into the crowds. Others assemble ramshackle barricades and shine laser pointers to disrupt the scopes of the heavily armed security forces. Authorities brand them vandals and \u201crioters.\u201d But the crackdowns that ensued only galvanized further dissent.Support our journalism. Subscribe today.arrow-rightThat\u2019s how the script read for months of unrest that gripped Hong Kong last year. But it has also been on view in recent weeks in the West Coast city of Portland, Ore., the site of an intensifying showdown between demonstrators and the Trump administration. Over the weekend, Black Lives Matter protesters marched in cities across the country, from Los Angeles to Omaha to Seattle. In some instances, they clashed with police and federal security forces, leading to arrests.ADADPortland, though, has become ground zero of a new phase in the United States\u2019 summer of discontent. The city, as my colleagues noted, has \u201ca long tradition of protest as a subculture of anarchism.\u201d Petty street skirmishes there between far-right and anti-fascist groups have inflamed American social media in recent years. Their reelection prospects narrowing, President Trump and his Republican allies have seized upon the disturbances in the Pacific Northwest as a parable for what the American left supposedly has in store for the rest of the country. As a result, Portland has become the first battleground in an apparent nationwide surge of federal agents deployed to big cities with the White House\u2019s prodding \u2014 and without local approval.Senior administration officials \u201csaid the White House had long wanted to amplify strife in cities, encouraging [Department of Homeland Security] officials to talk about arrests of violent criminals in sanctuary cities and repeatedly urging [Immigration and Customs Enforcement] to disclose more details of raids than some in the agency were comfortable doing,\u201d my colleagues reported. \u201c\u2018It was about getting viral online content,\u2019 one of the officials said.\u201dHere, too, there are echoes of what transpired in Hong Kong. The autocratic regime in Beijing has moved to radically curtail Hong Kong\u2019s special freedoms, justifying its implementation of a new national security law on grounds that it will pacify a troubled city. \u201cWe just want to put our house in order,\u201d Wang Huiyao, president of the Center for China and Globalization, a Beijing-based think tank, told the Financial Times. \u201cSome countries may not see the benefits of this for the time being but they will see sooner or later a more prosperous Hong Kong and more stable China, which is of benefit to the whole world.\u201dADADAnalysts also argue that Chinese President Xi Jinping may be keen to stir hard-line sentiment among ordinary Chinese by cracking down on the troublesome former British colony. \u201cTaking strong action on Hong Kong stoked mainland Chinese nationalism at a time of declining economic growth and rising domestic frustrations over public health and safety,\u201d observed Ryan Hass of Brookings.But, as in Hong Kong, the heavy-handedness of security forces in U.S. cities has hardly calmed dissent. The sight of federal agents, some in unmarked uniforms, detaining protesters in Portland only led to greater howls of protest and a daily showdown outside a major federal courthouse. \u201cThe scenes of militarized federal forces on the city\u2019s streets have stunned many Americans and unnerved former Homeland Security officials, but they have not quieted the protests,\u201d my colleagues reported. \u201cIn many ways, the agents and the barricades they have erected have re-energized the demonstrators and have converted the courthouse into a proxy for the Trump administration itself.\u201dYellow-clad \u201cmoms\u201d took to the front lines. The mayor of Portland joined the throngs and got tear-gassed as a result. \u201cThis is a democracy, not a dictatorship,\u201d Oregon Gov. Kate Brown (D) said in a statement. \u201cWe cannot have secret police abducting people in unmarked vehicles. I can\u2019t believe I have to say that to the President of the United States.\u201dOf course, the echoes can grow fainter. Protesters in the United States aren\u2019t arrayed against a single-party dictatorship bent on snuffing out their waning political autonomy. At the same time, some Republican politicians who have cast demonstrations in the United States as the work of troublemakers or rioters, using language jarringly similar to that of Beijing and its proxies, have made themselves champions of Hong Kong\u2019s pro-democracy movement.ADADBut as Trump raises the stakes in the nation\u2019s cities, critics warn of the dangerous precedents he is setting. \u201cWe are watching the perfect and perhaps inevitable combination of a domestic-security superagency and a President who rejects all mechanisms of accountability, including the Senate confirmation process,\u201d wrote the New Yorker\u2019s Masha Gessen.\u201cFor decades, conservative activists and leaders have warned that \u2018jackbooted thugs\u2019 from the federal government were going to come to take away Americans\u2019 civil rights with no due process and no recourse,\u201d observed the Atlantic\u2019s David A. Graham. \u201cNow they\u2019re here \u2014 but they\u2019re deployed by a staunchly right-wing president with strong conservative support.\u201dIn Portland, some black activists fear the city\u2019s overwhelmingly white protest movement is shifting the focus from their historic grievances in Oregon. \u201cWe cannot let teargas and rubber bullets define the moment that we\u2019re in now,\u201d E.D. Mondain\u00e9, president of the Portland branch of the NAACP, told the Guardian. \u201cWe must seize the moment and assure the world that this time racism will no longer live.\u201dADADThe protests, meanwhile, don\u2019t look like they\u2019re about to fade. \u201cWe\u2019re buying motorcycle armor so we can go out there,\u201d Mac Smiff, a 39-year-old artist, told my colleagues last week. \u201cThis is not Fallujah, this is Portland, Oregon, and it\u2019s like war games out here.\u201dRead more: The U.S. ramps up its confrontation with ChinaDid Europe have its \u2018Hamiltonian\u2019 moment?

Subscribe today.arrow-rightAs lawmakers drill down on the size and scope of tech companies at today's blockbuster antitrust hearing, the leaders of Amazon, Apple, Google and Facebook plan to focus on the positive contributions of their businesses during the pandemic, from creating jobs to keeping people connected. They'll also paint their companies as quintessentially American engines of innovation that do more to help small businesses than to harm them, according to documents my colleagues and I obtained.\u00a0Lawmakers and consumer advocates hope this will be a turning point that ushers in Silicon Valley regulation.\u00a0But that will be very challenging: Each company in today's hot seat before the House Judiciary antitrust subcommittee has a unique business model. And the ways lawmakers fear the companies could leverage their power to squash rivals and influence society are very distinct.\u00a0ADAD\u201cOne of the things that makes this hearing so complicated is they're not interchangeable,\u201d said Gigi Sohn, a distinguished fellow at the Georgetown Law Institute for Technology Law & Policy. Compared to other big events when lawmakers hauled in executives from other industries under scrutiny \u2013 such as tobacco or banking \u2013 the tech companies appearing today \u201call have different problems, though some of them overlap,\u201d Sohn said.\u00a0Not to mention the executives are appearing over video conference \u2013 a format that's not exactly conducive to made-for-TV moments despite it being a pivotal moment in lawmakers' year-long investigation into Big Tech.\u00a0Here's what you need to know:\u00a0Jeff Bezos will stress the extraordinarily competitive nature of the global retail market in his first-ever congressional appearance.\u00a0Why lawmakers are worried: The Amazon chief executive's e-commerce empire is massive. Lawmakers are sure to grill Bezos about whether the company has abused its position as a key sales platform to harness data from third-party sellers and give its own products a leg up. Amazon has denied engaging in such a practice, but Rep. David N. Cicilline (D-R.I.) has questioned this in light of news reports that appear to contradict previous assurances the company made to the panel.\u00a0ADADAmazon\u2019s argument: Bezos, who also owns The Washington Post, will tell a deeply personal yarn about his rise from being the son of a teen mom to building one of the largest companies in the world. He\u2019ll argue that the company\u2019s size has allowed it to create many jobs during a global pandemic, and support important social causes such as addressing climate change. His opening remarks, however, didn\u2019t indicate how he plans to respond to the accusations that the company siphons data from rivals for its own gain. He plans to note that most Americans have a favorable impression of Amazon, citing \u201cleading independent polls\u201d that he didn\u2019t identify, as my colleague Jay Greene reported.\u00a0\u201cAt Amazon, customer obsession has made us what we are, and allowed us to do ever greater things,\u201d Bezos wrote. (Read Amazon's testimony here.)Apple's Tim Cook will argue its App Store opened the \u201cgate wider\u201d for developers.Why lawmakers are worried: Companies ranging from Tinder to Microsoft have raised concerns that Apple's App Store is too powerful. They've complained about Apple policies that force companies to hand over a portion of the subscriptions and other purchases made through iPhone apps. Companies argue these policies have hurt them financially and left iPhone owners with higher bills. It has only intensified during the pandemic as more companies make their services virtual. Developers have also accused Apple of using its position to copy the best ideas, causing companies to buckle under pressure, Reed Albergotti reported.\u00a0ADADApple's defense: Cook will say the App Store is a \u201crevolutionary alternative\u201d to the options software developers had before it launched in 2008, compared to pushing physical products or scoring shelf space in a brick-and-mortar store with limited reach. He'll emphasize that Apple has never raised commissions or added fees since introducing the App Store. He'll also highlight the company's focus on privacy and security.\u00a0\u201cI share the subcommittee's belief that competition is a great virtue, that it promotes innovation, that it makes space for the next great idea and that it gives consumers more choices,\u201d Cook is expected to say. (Read Apple's testimony here.)Mark Zuckerberg will focus on how Facebook is bringing people together during the pandemic.\u00a0Why lawmakers are worried: Facebook is staring down a host of political controversies in Washington, but the crux of the competition concerns revolve around how it reportedly siphons data about competing social media start-ups to imitate or snap up their services. My colleague Elizabeth Dwoskin previously outlined that strategy, which hinged on an app called Onavo. The company used it to glean insights about what customers were doing when they weren't on Facebook or other services the company owns, such as Instagram. That allowed Facebook to spot other competitors on the rise. However, the app created major data privacy concerns, and Facebook ultimately shut down the service last year.\u00a0ADADFacebook's argument: Zuckerberg will try to emphasize the fleeting nature of success in Silicon Valley, noting that when he moved the company to the former campus of Sun Microsystems, he left the old company's sign up as a reminder to employees to stay hungry. \u201cFacebook is a successful company now, but we got there the American way: we started with nothing and provided better products that people find valuable,\u201d Zuckerberg will say. \u201cAs I understand our laws, companies aren\u2019t bad just because they are big.\u201d\u00a0Zuckerberg will also stress how his business is even more critical during stay-at-home orders: He'll note that people use his services to stay in touch with family and friends and get the latest information from public officials about the pandemic. He'll tout new products the company has built in response to the coronavirus crisis. (Read Facebook's testimony here.)Alphabet chief executive Sundar Pichai will emphasize free services such as search and maps benefit consumers.Why lawmakers are worried: Critics say Google is dominant in search and advertising, and that can harm a range of competitors, from news outlets to travel companies. Google could imminently face antitrust scrutiny in the United States, as Tony Romm reported that the Justice Department and state attorneys general could file charges against the company as soon as this summer. European regulators have fined the search giant billions over concerns that its advertising practices break antitrust laws, and they've signaled more action is coming.\u00a0ADADGoogle's take: Pichai, who is chief executive of Google and its parent company, will argue that the company plays an essential role in expanding access to greater economic opportunity through technology. Pichai will speak about his own experience having regular Internet access for the first time as a graduate student in the United States, and he'll particularly highlight how the company's products are being used by educators during the pandemic. He'll also speak about the major investments the company makes in research and development in the United States.\u00a0\u201cTo this day, I haven\u2019t forgotten how access to innovation and technology altered the course of my life,\u201d Pichai plans to say. \u201cGoogle aims to build products that increase access to opportunity for everyone \u2014 no matter where you live, what you believe, or how much money you earn.\u201d (Read Google's testimony here.)The tech giants\u2019 rivals are not exactly quiet today.\u00a0One of the revolutionary aspects of the congressional investigation has been other competitors\u2019 willingness to speak out about the giants, a sea change in Silicon Valley.\u00a0ADADToday, TikTok jumped on the bandwagon: As Zuckerberg is expected to warn that lawmakers need to be wary of the threat of competition from Chinese tech companies as they weigh tech regulation, TikTok's chief executive Kevin Mayer called out Facebook for launching a \u201ccopycat product\u201d which lets people create short videos similar to those on TikTok.Mayer said the company welcomes competition: \u201cFacebook is even launching another copycat product, Reels (tied to Instagram), after their other copycat Lasso failed quickly,\u201d he said. \u201cBut let's focus our energies on fair and open competition in service of our consumers, rather than maligning attacks by our competitor \u2014 namely Facebook \u2014 disguised as patriotism and designed to put an end to our very presence in the U.S.\" Beijing-based ByteDance owns TikTok.\u00a0Correction: TikTok's chief executive is Kevin Mayer. A previous version incorrectly listed his last name.ADADProgramming note: The Washington Post\u2019s Libby Casey will anchor a special report around the judiciary committee hearing on Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google.\u00a0 Casey will be joined by reporters Elizabeth Dwoskin, Tony Romm and me for analysis on how this event may affect consumers, the economy and legislation. Tune in here.\u00a0Our top tabsGoogle rejected an anti-Trump ad showing clips of police violence against protesters.Hulu and Verizon also rejected the campaign, which was sponsored by the liberal groups Priorities USA and Color of Change PAC, Isaac Stanley-Becker reports. The 30-second ad shows clips of police officers beating protesters set against a recent Trump speech where he calls himself a \u201cpresident of law and order.\u201dADGoogle maintained it blocked the graphic ad to prevent harm to users.\u00a0AD\u201cWe don\u2019t allow advertisers to run ads that contain graphic violence, including depictions of blood, baton beatings, and other instances of physical trauma,\u201d said Charlotte Smith, a spokeswoman for the company. \u201cThese policies apply to all advertisers, regardless of political affiliation.\u201d Hulu and Verizon expressed similar reasons for rejecting the ad to Priorities USA. Facebook ran the ad.The groups say the content moderation decision highlights an ongoing double standard for the Trump campaign.\u201cThe decision by Google and other online platforms to censor our ads while allowing Trump to use violence in his own ads only exacerbates the problem and prevents our elected officials from being held accountable for their dangerous actions,\u201d Priorities USA Deputy Executive Director Jenn Stowe said.Twitter suspended Donald Trump Jr. for 12 hours after he tweeted coronavirus misinformation.The suspension underlines the tough stance the platform has taken against medical misinformation during the pandemic, Rachel Lerman, Katie Shepherd and Taylor Telford report. But it also renewed accusations of bias against conservatives at a time when the Trump administration is pushing regulators to reevaluate legal protections for social media companies.The restriction was \u201cfurther proof that Big Tech is intent on killing free expression online and is another instance of them committing election interference to stifle Republican voices,\u201d Donald Trump Jr.'s spokesman Andy Surabian said. Tech companies have repeatedly denied that they're biased against conservatives.\u00a0The video shared by Trump shows a news conference of a group of doctors claiming without evidence that hydroxychloroquine could cure and treat the virus. Twitter removed videos of the news conference, deleting several of the tweets that President Trump shared in the process. Medical experts say there is not enough evidence to prove that hydroxychloroquine, a drug used to treat malaria, helps covid-19 patients recover, and it carries deadly side effects, particularly taken without a doctor's order.\u00a0The president also praised the viral social media video in a news conference with reporters yesterday.\u00a0A federal judge ruled that New York must start paying Uber and Lyft drivers unemployment benefits.The ruling gives legal weight to drivers in an ongoing battle with ride-hailing companies over their worker classification, Noam Scheiber at the New York Times reports.The New York Taxi Workers Alliance brought the lawsuit in May, alleging that the state was taking weeks and even months longer to pay unemployed ride-hailing drivers than other unemployed employees. The lawsuit alleged the delay was due at least in part to the state's failure to require Uber and Lyft to submit lost earnings data. \u00a0The ruling noted that in 294 cases where the state found Uber to be an employer, Uber appealed 227. Uber abandoned 200 of the appeals, but the state accused both Uber and Lyft of intentionally trying to evade sharing earnings data. \u00a0ber and Lyft denied the allegations.Both Uber and Lyft are facing lawsuits in Massachusetts and California claiming the companies are misclassifying workers as independent contractors.\u00a0Rant and raveCES, the world's largest tech trade show, is officially going virtual next year.

Trump has threatened to ban the app over concerns that it could be used by China for spying.TikTok has repeatedly denied imposing Chinese censorship laws in the United States. The company also says it has not and would not share any U.S. user data with Beijing.\u00a0\"TikTok isn't the go-to app to follow political news or candidates, but we're taking cues from the experience of our peers during the last US presidential election and proactively investing to safeguard our app,\" TikTok spokeswoman Jamie Favazza said. TikTok already has a strict policy against disinformation, and we don't accept political ads. Our content and moderation policies are led by our US-based team in California and aren't influenced by any foreign government.\"Democrats are pushing for data privacy provisions for coronavirus response data in the next relief bill.A group of a dozen Democratic senators and one independent wrote to Senate leadership yesterday urging them to include legislation that would put guardrails protecting data collected for covid-19 from being used for non-public health reasons. They argue that a failure to build public trust in data collection efforts will undermine the government's coronavirus response.The next relief bill could pass as early as this week.Rite Aid quietly rolled out inaccurate facial recognition to 200 stores in the United States. \u00a0The technology was deployed in largely lower-income and nonwhite neighborhoods, Jeffrey Dastin at Reuters found. The retailer's expansive program, which it has since discontinued, highlights the dangers of the largely unregulated use of facial recognition technology in the United States.\u00a0Government studies have shown that facial recognition software is less effective on darker skin tones. Ten current and former Rite Aid employees who worked on the loss-prevention program said that one of the systems it used from company FaceFirst routinely misidentified people, especially shoppers of color.

Just what is it that keeps investors coming back to gold?The SituationSupport our journalism. Subscribe today.arrow-rightGold surged to a record as the pandemic of 2020 unleashed a  torrent of forces that fueled demand for its\u00a0perceived safety from the turmoil. There were fears of more government-ordered lockdowns through the end of the year, along with a slide in the U.S. dollar against the euro and yen. Moves to cushion the economy from the pandemic\u2019s impact led to the vast creation of new money by central banks, sparking the same fears about an eventual resurgance\u00a0of inflation that drove gold to its last record in September 2011. Bullion had also briefly spiked after Donald Trump\u2019s upset victory in the U.S. presidential election in 2016. In between there were years of steady prices. That began to change in 2019, when slowing global economic growth and a trade war between the world\u2019s biggest economies dented the belief that riskier assets would continue climbing. Holdings in bullion-backed exchange-traded funds surged for four months during the pandemic, their longest streak since 2006, as retail investors piled in.\u00a0With interest rates and bond yields at historic lows, the opportunity cost of\u00a0owning gold has evaporated and investors are looking for havens that won\u2019t lose value.ADADThe BackgroundDiscarded as a monetary system when its peg to the dollar ended\u00a0in the 1970s, gold spiked to $850 in 1980 on a bout of inflation. Prices slumped in the following two decades as\u00a0central banks\u00a0around the world shrank their reserves and miners locked in prices for future production. The launch of the first gold ETF in 2003, which made it possible for retail and equity-market investors to directly access the metal via their stockbrokers, set off a wave of gold buying that lifted prices for almost a decade. Then the 2008 financial crisis sent prices steadily up as money was parked in havens on fear that bond-buying by central banks would lead to hyperinflation \u2014\u00a0it didn\u2019t. Even so, some investors never warmed to gold. Legendary business guru Warren Buffett expressed his disdain\u00a0for the metal because it has no inherent yield and isn\u2019t productive like, say, companies or farmland. He wrote in 2012 that investors in gold are motivated by their \u201cbelief that the ranks of the fearful will grow.\u201dThe ArgumentADADMore than perhaps any other investment, bullion acts as an echo chamber for anxieties about the global financial system and the ability of central bankers to keep economic growth going.\u00a0Gold bears say it is a relic of history and that there are better ways of hedging against uncertainty, including\u00a0financial instruments such as derivatives. Bulls say it offers them a simpler way to protect\u00a0against a wider range of risks. Demand for gold is supported by rising incomes in\u00a0China, India and other\u00a0Asian countries, where families\u00a0often buy it for dowries and there are fewer safe stores of wealth. In the West, some fans of gold, known as \u201cgold bugs,\u201d believe it should be restored to its place as the guarantor of government-issued currencies. Even one of Trump\u2019s nominees for the Federal Reserve was historically an advocate of returning to the gold standard. But ultimately, gold\u2019s reputation for withstanding the effects of inflation \u2014 at the cost of sacrificing returns \u2014 comes into its own when interest rates on bonds drop below the rate of general price increases. Compared with the trillions of dollars\u2019 worth of bonds around the world now delivering  negative returns, gold is shining once again.The Reference Shelf\u2022 Peter Bernstein explores the history of the metal in his book,\u00a0 \u201cThe Power of Gold.\u201dADAD\u2022 Comments from former U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S.

Robert Menendez (N.J.), the most senior Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.AD\u201cIf China continues to perfect the tools of digital authoritarianism and is able to effectively implement them both domestically and abroad, then China, not the United States and its allies, will shape the digital environment,\u201d the report added.Is it time to delete TikTok? A guide to the rumors and the real privacy risks.The report details how China has sought to \u201ccreate a new model of governance for the digital domain,\u201d through mass surveillance technology and controlling access to information and content. American social media platforms like Google, Twitter and Facebook are banned inside China.ADThe report also details how China has invested in technology that aids authoritarianism, such as facial recognition software and other surveillance technology. This technology is now being exported to countries around the world, such as Venezuela, Uzbekistan, Zimbabwe and others.ADThe report focuses also on how digital surveillance is expanding to include the collection of DNA samples, fingerprints, voice samples and blood types \u2014 in particular from those in the western Xinjiang region, where the Chinese Communist Party has embarked on a campaign to strip the minority of their language, culture and religion.This week, the U.S. Commerce Department added 11 companies to a trade blacklist over alleged violations in Xinjiang, bringing the number of Chinese companies on the list to just under 50. In a statement following the sanctions, Wilbur Ross, the secretary of commerce, said, \u201cBeijing actively promotes the reprehensible practice of forced labor and abusive DNA collection and analysis schemes to repress its citizens.\u201dAD\u201cThis action will ensure that our goods and technologies are not used in the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s despicable offensive against defenseless Muslim minority populations,\u201d Ross added.ADHuman rights advocates studying China\u2019s use of digital technologies to control its citizens have long argued that Western and other governments need to act against the Chinese government and  its actions. The coronavirus pandemic has also led to a huge amount of data collection in China as a response to the public health crisis, and surveillance technology has also been used to identify critics of the government\u2019s response.Most recently, Beijing passed new national security laws in Hong Kong, which could potentially see the extension of the Chinese surveillance state into one of the freest Internet landscapes in the world. Google, Twitter, Facebook and others \u2014 that under the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d framework could operate freely in Hong Kong and in some cases have employees there \u2014 have now paused their data requests from Hong Kong authorities. Some American tech companies there have now shelved plans for future investment, and others are contemplating pulling employees out.AD\u201cWhat the Chinese government is trying to achieve is unprecedented in human history,\u201d said Maya Wang, China senior researcher at Human Rights Watch. \u201cNo other government has had such an intrusive knowledge of such a large number of people over such a wide swath of land anywhere at any time in history \u2014 and they are wielding that power of data.\u201dADWang argues that while it is legitimate for other governments to be \u201cvery, very worried about the Chinese government and the pursuit of this kind of digital totalitarianism,\u201d the U.S. approach has been insufficient and amounts to a \u201cwhack-a-mole\u201d approach with companies like Huawei and TikTok. Some policies of the Trump administration, she added, appear to be rooted in an anti-China approach, rather than a holistic approach on how to deal with the privacy and security of its citizens.Menendez\u2019s report argues that the Trump administration has failed to adequately respond to the threat posed by China\u2019s approach to cyberspace, and that the U.S. government needs to rally the international community around the common goal of offering an alternative to the Chinese digital model.ADAmong the recommendations is that the United States should aggressively develop alternatives to Chinese 5G technology along with its allies, using federal funds, and create an industry consortium on 5G. The report also recommends that the United States should establish a fund to support organizations worldwide like NGOs and think tanks that are fighting to counter surveillance regimes.AD\u201cThere has been a sharp increase in bipartisan interest for Congress to recalibrate our nation\u2019s entire China policy,\u201d he said.\u201cAs more of my colleagues recognize the scope of the challenge that China presents to the United States and to the entire international order, it is my hope that this report will not only strengthen their sense of urgency to act but also inform the legislative process,\u201d he added.\n\n\u2018Police cloud\u2019: Chinese database tracks apps, car location and even electricity usage in Muslim regionMasks, cash and apps: How Hong Kong\u2019s protesters find ways to outwit the surveillance statePompeo says the U.S. is \u2018certainly looking at\u2019 banning TikTok and other Chinese apps", "comment": "139 Comments", "topic": "Asia & Pacific"}, {"cover": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/SNFVLFGPC4I6VPDKNBA3FDMQSM.jpghttps://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/SNFVLFGPC4I6VPDKNBA3FDMQSM.jpg", "title": "North Korea locks down border city as first possible coronavirus case is announced", "date": "Jul 26, 2020", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/north-korea-locks-down-border-city-as-first-possible-covid-19-case-announced/2020/07/26/8378cc76-cf14-11ea-99b0-8426e26d203b_story.html", "keyword": "China and the world order", "website": "the Washington Post", "author": "Min Joo Kim", "content": "SEOUL \u2014 North Korea locked down the city of Kaesong near the border with South Korea after finding what could be the country's first official coronavirus case\u00a0there, state media reported Sunday.North Korea\u2019s state-controlled Central News Agency announced \u201ca critical situation in which the vicious virus could be said to have entered the country\u201d after a suspected patient returned from South Korea by illegally crossing the border last week.Support our journalism.

The 32,771 reported deaths from the disease in India, however, represent a far lower fatality rate than in the other two countries, in part because of limited testing. Modi\u2019s office says new high-volume test facilities in Noida, a suburb of New Delhi, and Mumbai and Kolkata, each capable of as many as 10,000 tests per day, will help authorities track the virus.

Two Southeast Asian diplomats said Monday that Vietnam, which leads the Association of Southeast Asian Nations this year, hopes to hold face-to-face meetings in mid-September instead of over video if the annual gatherings were to be held as originally scheduled later this week. The 10-nation bloc hosts the ASEAN Regional Forum, which brings together its top diplomats with counterparts from the United States, China, Japan, Russia, India, the two Koreas and other Asia Pacific countries to discuss the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and other security issues.

Health Minister Chris Hipkins says they\u2019ve also asked South Korean authorities to undertake a second test to make sure the passenger has the virus. It has been nearly three months since the last case of community transmission was found in New Zealand and any proof the passenger caught the virus while in New Zealand would come as a big shock to the nation of 5 million people. Health officials in New Zealand say their counterparts in South Korea suspect the traveler was infected while in transit in Singapore. \u201cWe have got our contact tracing system kicking into gear though,\u201d Hipkins said.AD\u2014 China on Monday reported 61 new cases of coronavirus, spread between its northeastern and northwestern regions.

Subscribe today.arrow-rightThe hackers Li Xiaoyu and Dong Jiazhi stole data mostly for their own profit but also helped secure information for China\u2019s civilian spy agency, the Ministry of State Security (MSS), according to an indictment\u00a0 by the U.S. Justice Department. They also got help from an insider at the MSS, Ellen Nakashima and Devlin Barrett report.This marks the first time federal prosecutors have charged anyone in China with hacking for both the state and for personal enrichment.ADBut the move reflects a long-term trend in China, Russia, Iran and other U.S. adversary nations where criminal hackers frequently aid state intelligence services when asked, and government and military employees often moonlight by hacking for profit.\u00a0AD\u201cChina has now taken its place, alongside Russia, Iran and North Korea, in that shameful club of nations that provide a safe haven for cybercriminals in exchange for those criminals being \u2018on call\u2019 to work for the benefit of the state, here to feed the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s insatiable hunger for American and other non-Chinese companies\u2019 hard-earned intellectual property, including covid-19 research,\u201d said John C. Demers, head of the Justice Department\u2019s National Security Division.\u00a0Demers accused Chinese officials of being \u201cwilling to turn a blind eye to prolific criminal hackers operating within its borders.\" The indictments came the same day U.S. officials ordered China to close a consulate in Houston and amid a roiling conflict between the nations over intellectual property theft, the coronavirus and China's recent crackdown in Hong Kong.Enlisting criminals to do government hacking work has long been common in Russia.\u00a0That has resulted in a cadre of Russian cybercriminals who operate with relative impunity and often have strong links to the government. One prominent example was Roman Seleznev, the son of a high-ranking Russian parliamentarian who stole millions from Americans in credit card hacking schemes.\u00a0ADADSeleznev was sentenced to 27 years in U.S. prison in 2017 after he was arrested during a vacation in the Maldives and extradited to the United States.\u00a0It\u2019s long been common in China for military hackers to hack for profit during their off hours. But inviting criminals to help do state business is somewhat more novel.\u00a0\u201cThis is a system that\u2019s been used by Russia for years and it\u2019s being emulated by other adversaries,\u201d Tom Kellermann, head of cybersecurity strategy at the software company VMWare, told me.\u00a0He compared it to narcotics traffickers acting with impunity in Latin America.\u00a0\u201cThis is a protection racket we\u2019ve seen before,\u201d Kellermann said. \u201cRussia pioneered this [scenario] where cybercriminals understand that if they act like cyber militias, they\u2019ll be untouched and untouchable by Western law enforcement.\u201dADADWhile the systems function similarly in Russia and China, China probably retains greater control over the sort of cybercrime that happens inside its territory.\u201cRussia\u2019s essentially a haven where you can be a [cyber]criminal and if you work out a deal with the [state intelligence services] and do them favors, they leave you alone,\u201d Jim Lewis, a cybersecurity expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told me. \u201cIn China it\u2019s more complicated. They treat you more like a contractor.\u201dThe Chinese government also has an extensive system to monitor and censor Internet traffic \u2014 often called the \u201cgreat firewall of China\u201d \u2014 which gives officials much greater insight into what criminal hackers are doing and how they can best be pressed into service.Dong and Li\u2019s hacking targets displayed a mix of Chinese state targets and their own financial interests.\u00a0In addition to coronavirus research, the pair targeted high-tech manufacturing, pharmaceuticals and gaming software development companies. They also targeted human rights activists, Hong Kong protesters and the office of the Dalai Lama.ADADThe pair stole terabytes of trade secrets and other data from Western companies over more than a decade. The victim list includes companies in California, Maryland, Washington state, Texas, Virginia and Massachusetts, according to the indictment, which didn\u2019t share the companies\u2019 names.\u00a0More recently they \u201cresearched vulnerabilities in the networks of biotech and other firms publicly known for work on covid-19 vaccines, treatments, and testing technology.\u201d The Justice Department did not say whether they successfully stole any vaccine data.\u00a0The pair was also willing to resort to criminal shakedown techniques. In at least one case they threatened to release source code they\u2019d stolen unless the victim they filched it from paid them off with cryptocurrency, the indictment states.\u00a0ADADThey\u2019re facing 11 counts of conspiring to access computers without authorization, conspiring to steal trade secrets and aggravated identity theft, among other charges.\u00a0\u201cChina steals intellectual property and research which bolsters its economy, and then they use that illicit gain as a weapon to silence any country that would dare challenge their illegal actions,\u201d FBI Deputy Director David Bowdich said. \u201cThis type of economic coercion is not what we expect from a trusted world leader. It is what we expect from an organized criminal syndicate.\u201d\u00a0The porous border between government and criminal hackers also makes it far tougher to combat global cybercrime.\u00a0It's effectively guaranteed, for example, that China will never extradite Dong and Li, to the United States to face charges.\u00a0ADAD\u201cWhat would you call a game where one side plays by the rule and the other side says it won\u2019t? That\u2019s the game we\u2019re in,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cThe Chinese and Russians won\u2019t respect international law unless it\u2019s enforced.\u201dIt\u2019s also more difficult for countries to reliably agree about anything that\u2019s off limits for hacking because governments can claim not \u00a0to be responsible for what cybercriminals in their territory are doing.\u201cIt definitely makes it difficult to be optimistic that you\u2019re going to get to a set of cyber norms,\u201d Adam Segal, a cybersecurity and China expert at the Council on Foreign Relations, told me. \u201cEven if state representatives agree to them, they can just say, \u2018These are criminal hackers and we just can\u2019t rein them in.\u2019 \u201dThe keysWith four months to go, state and county election officials are still behind on basic cybersecurity.\u00a0Some local election officials are still sharing passwords among multiple people, storing lists of passwords in unencrypted formats where hackers can scoop them up and using default passwords that came with their computer programs, Matt Masterson, a top election security official at the Department of Homeland Security, said during a meeting of the National Association of Secretaries of State.ADADIt\u2019s also taking state and local election offices 30 to 60 days to patch known computer bugs, Masterson said. That lag time is a vast improvement from just two years ago but it still gives hackers far too many opportunities to use those bugs to break into election systems and steal or corrupt data, he said. In many cases, local election officials want to patch those bugs more quickly but don\u2019t have the necessary technology and cybersecurity staff to do it, he said.Election officials aren\u2019t doing much worse on cybersecurity than some other major industry sectors but the consequences could be particularly grave. \u201cThe difference is everyone's watching,\u201d Masterson said.\u00a0On the positive side, most of the big problems can be fixed before November if local election offices buckle down. \"There's still lots that can be done in the next several weeks\" before the election, Masterson said.\u00a0Facebook is taking flak for putting the same label on posts about voting by both President Trump and Joe Biden.\u00a0The president's Facebook post was an attack on mail voting, which the president claims without evidence, enables widespread cheating. \u201cMail-In Voting, unless changed by the courts, will lead to the most CORRUPT ELECTION in our Nation\u2019s History! #RIGGEDELECTION,\u201d Trump posted.\u00a0ADADBiden's post read, \u201cWe have to vote Donald Trump out this November,\u201d and solicited donations.The label links to the federal government's website about absentee voting. It's different from the one Facebook uses to flag content that's \u201cnewsworthy\u201d but may violate its policies, Rachel Lerman reports.\u00a0Biden spokesman Bill Russo slammed the company for implying the posts were equivalent.Facebook has pledged to remove posts that suppress voting in the days ahead of the election. But it's resisted calls to fact check the president's false and misleading claims, even as Twitter has proved more willing to do so.\u00a0Roger McNamee, author of \u201cZucked: Waking Up to the Facebook Catastrophe\":Twitter, which added fact-check labels to previous Trump tweets accusing mail-in ballots of being fraudulent, did not label a similar post, citing its policy not to take actions against \u201cbroad, nonspecific statements.\"\u00a0South Korea's coronavirus tracing app could have exposed the location of quarantined users.The app exposed the names and locations of people in quarantine. It also could have allowed hackers to tamper with data to mislead the app about a quarantined individual's location, the New York Times reports.Researcher\u00a0Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Rechtenstein also found that the app made it easy for hackers to steal user data.

And WHO will not be distracted by these comments.\u201dADADBritish newspapers reported Wednesday that Pompeo claimed Tedros had been \u201cbought\u201d by the Chinese government, an unusually personal accusation following the many broadsides the Trump administration has directed at WHO in recent months over its response to the emergence of the coronavirus in China.Critics say the Trump administration has been trying to distract attention from its own failings in managing the coronavirus outbreak in the United States, which has the most confirmed cases and virus-related deaths in the world.In recent months, the administration has repeatedly criticized WHO\u2019s handling of the pandemic and its alleged deference to Beijing. President Donald Trump has ordered the United States to withdraw next year from the agency it has bankrolled and supported for decades.ADPompeo was not asked about his reported comments at a news conference in Denmark on Wednesday. Before that appearance, The Times of London, citing unidentified attendees, reported he told a gathering of British lawmakers that the U.S. had intelligence suggesting Tedros had been \u201cbought\u201d by China\u2019s government and that his election as WHO chief in 2017 had led to the death of British nationals.ADThe State Department did not immediately respond to queries from The Associated Press about the British reports and Tedros\u2019 remarks, which included blaming partisan politics for worsening the pandemic.\u201cOne of the greatest threats we face continues to be the politicization of the pandemic. COVID-19 does not respect borders, ideologies or political parties,\u201d Tedros said Thursday. \u201cI have said it many times: COVID politics should be quarantined, and I\u2019m appealing again to all nations to work together.

There wasn\u2019t a single reported case of community transmission. Not a single death. A handful of cases were caught and isolated at the border, but otherwise people were returning to their normal lives. The country of 96 million people was hailed globally as a standout success.Support our journalism. Subscribe today.arrow-rightBut then a week ago, an outbreak began that has now grown to 48 cases in six parts of the country, including three of the largest cities, and forced authorities to reimpose restrictions many thought they had put behind them. And experts worry the outbreak could be much larger than currently known.The outbreak began last Thursday in the picturesque coastal city of Da Nang, where thousands of tourists were taking their summer vacations on golden beaches. A 57-year-old man was hospitalized with a fever and tested positive. His condition soon worsened and he was put on a ventilator.ADADHealth authorities swung into action. But the man\u2019s case was puzzling. He hadn\u2019t left his hometown for over a month and tests on his family and 100 other possible contacts all came back negative.Then health workers found three other infections in Da Nang over the weekend. And then on Monday, another 11. All of those were other patients or health workers at the Da Nang Hospital, where the man remains in critical condition.On Monday, authorities encouraged 80,000 tourists to leave the city by providing extra flights. Hotels emptied out and thousands canceled their plans to visit.Then on Tuesday, the city was put into lockdown. The packed beaches were closed, roamed only by patrolling security guards. But the order of events left some scratching their heads. Surely the fleeing tourists had the potential to spread the virus further?ADADIndeed by Thursday, authorities had found 43 cases, including two people in the capital, Hanoi. All of the cases seemed to link back to Da Nang and returning travelers.The cases included an American who had been a patient last week at Da Nang Hospital before moving to another hospital in Ho Chi Minh City in the south. His companion also tested positive.Authorities are now reimposing broader restrictions. They\u2019re closing nonessential services and banning large public gatherings in Da Nang and other nearby cities, and closing bars and clubs in Hanoi. They\u2019re also planning to test 21,000 people in the capital who recently returned from Da Nang.Pham Hien, owner of a noodle restaurant in Hanoi, said she will no longer have seated guests and instead will offer only takeout service or deliveries. She said her business is hurting but she will abide by government recommendations.ADAD\u201cWhat is important now is that all citizens join hands together with the government in this fight,\u201d she said.Just how the virus crept back remains a mystery. Authorities say they think the source was from outside Vietnam because this time the virus is a different strain.\u201cOne big difference I\u2019ve noticed between this wave and the previous one is that the cases we have right now, a lot of them are severe,\u201d said Marc Choisy, a Hanoi-based bio-mathematician with the Oxford University Clinical Research Unit.He said such a high proportion of severe cases could indicate that hundreds more asymptomatic cases remain undetected in the community.\u201cIt\u2019s very likely the disease is transmitting silently at the moment,\u201d he said.ADThe government, meanwhile, has been cracking down on people being smuggled into the country to avoid quarantine, making a string of arrests in cases of smuggled Chinese nationals. But authorities have yet to make any direct links between the people smuggling and the new outbreak.ADVietnam\u2019s struggle to contain the virus even after its initial success has been reflected in other places around the world. Australia was down to single-digit daily increases when an outbreak exploded in the city of Melbourne this month. On Thursday, authorities reported more than 700 new cases in and around Melbourne, a record. Other places from Hong Kong to Spain are battling new outbreaks after seemingly having the virus under control.Vietnam\u2019s quick actions in the face of its latest outbreak reflect the speed with which the government reacted to the initial virus threat, which experts say helped halt its spread.ADIn mid-February, for example, Vietnam put all 10,000 residents of the town of Son Loi, near Hanoi, under a three-week lockdown, even though there were only 16 confirmed cases in the entire country at that time.ADThe Communist government also used texts and social media to deliver concise instructions to its citizens. It even added short messages to every phone call.By March 22, Vietnam had essentially closed itself off to the outside world, stopping most international flights and shutting down the 900-mile (1,440-kilometer) land border it shares with China.Whenever authorities saw even a single case of community transmission, they jumped on it with contact tracing, lockdowns and widespread testing. The country also drew on its past experience defeating the SARS outbreak in 2003 and was able to limit its confirmed coronavirus cases before the recent outbreak to just 416.ADBut Choisy, the bio-mathematician, worries authorities have caught this coronavirus wave much later in its cycle than the first wave.AD\u201cWhen you haven\u2019t heard about new virus cases for a while, you begin to forget very quickly and you return to normal life,\u201d Choisy said. \u201cYou get used to it.\u201d___Associated Press science writer Victoria Milko in Jakarta, Indonesia, and reporter Nick Perry in Wellington, New Zealand, contributed to this report.___The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Department of Science Education.

For slower 3G and 4G mobile phone systems, the British government said providers should remove and replace most of the older Huawei gear over the next few years.UK may phase out Huawei in 5GThe United States has effectively banned Huawei and other Chinese companies from its nascent 5G platforms \u2014 wireless telecommunications networks seen as the key to revolutionary advances in the way people live, work and play. For much of the past two years, the Trump administration has sought, often seemingly in vain, to persuade allies to follow suit. In May, the United States imposed an export control that cut Huawei off from a key source of semiconductors made with U.S. technology, leading British officials to doubt they could count on the security of Huawei\u2019s equipment.ADADNow, with Britain joining the anti-Huawei fold, all \u201cFive Eye\u201d members of the world\u2019s most powerful intelligence-sharing alliance \u2014 Britain, the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand \u2014 or wireless carriers in their countries have effectively excluded or are moving to exclude Chinese firms from their 5G networks.U.S. pushes hard for a ban on Huawei in Europe, but its prices are nearly irresistibleSecretary of State Mike Pompeo welcomed the British action. \u201cWith this decision, the [United Kingdom] joins a growing list of countries from around the world that are standing up for their national security by prohibiting the use of untrusted, high-risk vendors,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cThe momentum in favor of secure 5G is building.\u201dHuawei\u2019s reversal of fortune in Britain will have major implications for countries that have not made final decisions on their 5G approach, especially Germany, Europe\u2019s largest telecom market.ADADIn March, the Danish telecom company TDC snubbed Huawei in awarding its 5G contract to European vendors. In June, the four largest telecom providers in Canada and Singapore did the same. And last week, Reuters reported that TIM, one of the largest wireless companies in Italy, has excluded Huawei from bidding on its 5G core networks.Over the past year, five European countries, including Poland, Estonia and the Czech Republic, have signed agreements with the United States ensuring that 5G suppliers would not be subject to control by a foreign government without independent judicial review \u2014 a standard that effectively excludes Chinese firms.\u201cThe writing\u2019s on the wall in Europe,\u201d said Paul Triolo, who heads the Eurasia Group\u2019s global technology policy practice. \u201cThere\u2019s no way that Huawei will remain a big supplier there.\u201dADADOn Tuesday, Ed Brewster, a spokesman for Huawei UK, called the British government\u2019s decision \u201cbad news for anyone in the UK with a mobile phone.\u201dThe pullback from Huawei \u201cthreatens to move Britain into the digital slow lane, push up bills and deepen the digital divide,\u201d Brewster said in a statement. \u201cInstead of \u2018levelling up\u2019 the government is levelling down and we urge them to reconsider.\u201d\u00a0Although 27 European governments have agreed to a common approach to mitigate 5G security risks, each state may implement the upgrade in its own way. Some, like Italy, France and the Netherlands, have passed laws that enable the government to veto a carrier\u2019s choice of a 5G provider. Others, like Belgium, ban \u201chigh risk\u201d vendors such as Huawei and ZTE, another Chinese firm, in the core network and cap their presence at 35 percent in the periphery. Still others, such as Spain and Portugal, have yet to decide.ADAD\u201cThe direction of travel in the biggest countries is toward a substantial reduction in Huawei\u2019s market share, and a gradual phasing out of the company over time,\u201d said Noah Barkin, an expert on Europe-China relations at Rhodium Group, a New York-based independent research organization.Other major economies have taken steps over the past year to fence off their 5G systems from Chinese firms. In Japan and South Korea, government rules effectively exclude them. In Israel, Chinese companies have been absent from 3G and 4G platforms and will be kept out of 5G as well.In India, which has not yet built its 5G system, the government last month barred two state-run firms from using Chinese gear. The order came in the wake of security clashes on India\u2019s disputed border with China in which 20 Indian soldiers were killed.ADADHuawei and ZTE are far from vanquished. Two of Europe\u2019s largest carriers, Deutsche Telekom and Vodafone, make extensive use of Huawei equipment and are resistant to switching suppliers. Huawei and ZTE comprise 85 to 90 percent of the 5G market in China, which accounts for about half the global market. And they are making a concerted push to win business in Latin America and Africa.The Chinese ambassador to Britain, Liu Xiaoming, warned London last week that excluding Huawei from 5G will \u201csend out the very wrong message.\u201d He stressed the growth in Chinese investment in Britain. \u201cIf you want to make China a hostile country,\u201d he said, \u201cyou have to bear the consequences.\u201dBut China hard-liners in Washington embraced Tuesday\u2019s decision.ADSen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) said London \u201cmade the right call\u201d on barring Huawei. \u201cThe special relationship is stronger now, as are our joint efforts to expose the threats\u201d that the Chinese Communist Party and its \u201csurveillance puppet\u201d pose \u201cto the free world,\u201d he said.ADSome of China\u2019s recent actions have soured European countries on Huawei.\u201cThe coronavirus crisis and China\u2019s very aggressive approach to shaping the narrative and capitalizing on global distraction have added to the concerns about China in Europe,\u201d said Janka Oertel, Berlin-based director of the Asia Program at the European Council on Foreign Relations.The European Union, she noted, recently accused China of a concerted effort to spread disinformation about the coronavirus pandemic. In Europe \u201cthe Chinese could have scored a big win,\u201d Oertel said. \u201cBut their actions backfired.\u201dADThe U.S. pressure campaign, which began in 2018, initially was not very effective in Western Europe. Officials perceived it as part of the U.S. trade dispute with China and bristled at what they saw as heavy-handed tactics, including threats to curb intelligence-sharing if allies did not bar Huawei.AD\u201cThe Trump administration polluted the debate in Europe,\u201d Barkin said. \u201cInstead of a question of \u2018Is it in our national interests to exclude Huawei?\u2019 it became \u2018Are we going to follow the orders of the Trump administration?\u2019 And a lot of people didn\u2019t want to do that.\u201dFor a long time, European officials wanted a \u201csmoking gun\u201d proving Huawei was a security threat, and intelligence shared by the United States was not convincing, European officials said.Over time, Trump administration officials moderated their rhetoric, underscoring not only the risks of surveillance but also the threat of network disruption. Officials began to refer to the Chinese Communist Party, not just the Chinese government, as a malign actor that through a new national intelligence law could compel any Chinese firm to conduct surveillance on its behalf. And they stressed their arguments had nothing to do with trade.\u201cWe really pivoted that discussion over time,\u201d said Robert Strayer, deputy assistant secretary of state for cyber policy. \u201cIf you fully understand the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s intent in the way the system works in China, there\u2019s not autonomy for those companies. You just need to understand the characteristics of modern technology, updated instantaneously with a software patch that has the vulnerability or the disruption coded into it \u2014 and you can\u2019t inspect your way out of the problem.\u201dLast year, the Trump administration placed Huawei on a blacklist that banned the export of U.S. technology to Huawei without Commerce Department permission. But significantly, Huawei still was able to purchase a vast quantity of semiconductors made outside the United States with U.S. software and equipment.So in May, Commerce tightened the export ban, blocking overseas shipments to Huawei of foreign-made semiconductors made with U.S. technology. The extension of the ban to Huawei-designed chips was key. It meant that Huawei\u2019s main semiconductor factory, Taiwan-based TSMC, could no longer produce semiconductors for the firm.This measure was \u201cdeliberately more targeted at Huawei\u2019s future ability to source hardware, particularly chips and things that would more affect 5G,\u201d said Ciaran Martin, who heads the National Cyber Security Center (NCSC), an arm of the British GCHQ spy agency. As a result, the center revised its earlier assessment that the security threat by Huawei could be mitigated. That paved the way for Tuesday\u2019s decision.In a blog post Tuesday, NCSC technical director Ian Levy said, \u201cWe think that Huawei products that are adapted to cope with the [Commerce rule] change are likely to suffer more security and reliability problems because of the massive engineering challenge ahead of them, and it will be harder for us to be confident in their use within our mitigation strategy.\u201dThe decision also was influenced by mounting pressure from the Conservative Party in Parliament. The 5G debate in Europe reflects a changed geopolitical reality, said Bob Seely, a Conservative lawmaker. \u201cThe relationship between the U.K. and China, and the world and China, and the United States and China, is fundamentally changing,\u201d he said. \u2018The government is now realizing that the China they want is not the China they\u2019re getting. \u201c\n\n", "comment": "360 Comments", "topic": "National Security"}, {"cover": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/RETHQPGRUYI6VPNGTAG7BLUEU4.jpghttps://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/RETHQPGRUYI6VPNGTAG7BLUEU4.jpg", "title": "Pentagon plan will move troops from Germany to Italy, Belgium and back to U.S.", "date": "Jul 29, 2020", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/us-troop-withdrawal-germany/2020/07/29/f5d23982-d19f-11ea-af07-1d058ca137ae_story.html", "keyword": "China and the world order", "website": "the Washington Post", "author": "Missy RyanKaren DeYoungLoveday Morris", "content": "The Trump administration will move about 12,000 troops in Germany to Italy, Belgium and back to the United States, the Pentagon said Wednesday, under a plan that defense leaders said was designed to strengthen deterrence against Russia but that President Trump has insisted would punish Berlin.Support our journalism.

Esper, unveiling the details of a long-awaited review of the U.S. military presence in Europe, said that about 5,600 of the troops would go to Italy and Belgium.  About 6,400 will be based in the United States and conduct some rotational deployments back to Europe, he said.The reduction, larger than previously expected, will reduce the number of U.S. troops stationed in Germany from 36,000 to 24,000, Esper told reporters at the Pentagon.AD\u201cAs anyone can see, the repositioning of our forces in Europe constitutes a major strategic and positive shift, wholly in line with the [national defense strategy], and consistent with other adjustments the U.S. has made within NATO in previous times,\u201d he said.ADTrump, however, has repeatedly criticized Germany for falling short on contributions to the NATO alliance, characterizing a \u201ctremendous delinquency\u201d as the reason for repositioning U.S. forces.While NATO nations share a target for spending 2 percent of their gross domestic product on defense, many member states do not meet that goal, including  Germany. Asked about the troop reduction Wednesday, Trump reiterated earlier statements that Germany had not paid its \u201cNATO fees.\u201dAD\u201cThe United States has been taken advantage of, on trade and on military and everything else for many years. And I\u2019m here, and I\u2019ve been straightening it out,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cBut Germany owes billions and billions of dollars to NATO. And why would we keep all of our troops there?\u201dTrump has had a fraught relationship with German Chancellor Angela Merkel over defense spending and other matters.AD\u201cWe are protecting Germany. So we are reducing the force because they\u2019re not paying bills. It\u2019s very simple,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they start paying bills, I would rethink.\u201dAccording to a NATO analysis from last fall, both Italy and Belgium have lower per capita defense spending than Germany.AD\u201cGermany pays Russia billions of dollars a year for Energy, and we are supposed to protect Germany from Russia. What\u2019s that all about?\u201d Trump said in a Twitter message late Wednesday.The plan has generated  opposition from politicians of both parties, who fear it will weaken deterrence against Russia and heighten strains within NATO. In a recent defense bill, House lawmakers approved steps limiting the administration\u2019s ability to execute the planned withdrawals. It is not clear whether the measure will appear in the final version of the bill.ADRepublican Sen. Mitt Romney (Utah) called the decision \u201ca gift to Russia\u201d that would harm U.S. interests. \u201cIt is a slap in the face at a friend and ally when we should instead be drawing closer in our mutual commitment to deter Russian and Chinese aggression,\u201d he said in a statement.ADSen. Jack Reed (R.I.), the top Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, described it as a \u201cself-inflicted wound\u201d that would do the opposite of what Esper said it would.\u201cThis is the type of move Secretary Mattis was able to stand up to in the past, but this administration seems to be unraveling under the strain of the pandemic,\u201d Reed said, referring to Jim Mattis, who  as Trump\u2019s first Pentagon chief  sought to block  presidential moves to buck traditional defense alliances.Former vice president Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, has sharply criticized Trump for his treatment of foreign allies and vowed, if elected, to strengthen NATO. His chief foreign policy adviser, Tony Blinken, told Reuters this week that a Biden administration would review the decision.ADADAt the Pentagon, Esper said the changes were one result of a lengthy review of the U.S. troop footprint, part of an attempt to modernize the military after two decades of insurgent wars and help compete against the advanced militaries of Russia and China.The reorganization in Europe would give commanders greater flexibility, bringing a squadron of F-16 fighter jets to Italy and moving two headquarters to Mons, Belgium, he said, while scrapping a plan to move 2,500 Air Force personnel from a base in Britain to Germany.Esper said that at least some of the forces returning to the United States, including 4,500 members of the 2nd Cavalry Regiment, would conduct rotational deployments to Poland, the Baltic states and the Black Sea region.ADIn addition to moving the headquarters of U.S. European Command to Belgium, Esper said the Pentagon may relocate the U.S. Africa Command, like EUCOM now located near the German city of Stuttgart.ADThe announced moves will cost an estimated \u201cseveral billion dollars,\u201d he said. Some troops will depart within weeks.In a statement, NATO Secretary General Jen Stoltenberg said Washington had \u201cconsulted closely\u201d with NATO nations.\u201cAs we face a more unpredictable world, we are stronger and safer when we stand together,\u201d he said.Esper said the  review of the U.S. military presence abroad had begun in the past year. He  had recently indicated that a first draft of the military\u2019s proposal would not be presented to him for review until September. But Trump, he acknowledged Wednesday, \u201caccelerated\u201d the European portion of the plan in the past month and announced he had approved a withdrawal from Germany.ADThat announcement came just weeks after military leaders discouraged Trump, who is eager to redeem his 2016 campaign pledge to downsize the U.S. military presence overseas before the November election, from ordering new withdrawals from Afghanistan and Syria.ADThe administration has threatened to withdraw troops from South Korea and Japan, which both host tens of thousands of U.S. personnel, amid stalled negotiations over U.S. demands for more compensation. The administration is also discussing future troop numbers with Iraq.The U.S. military\u2019s overseas presence is believed to be about 200,000, slightly more than when President Barack Obama left office.ADWednesday\u2019s announcement brought immediate objections from Germany, where officials have argued they have significantly boosted defense spending in recent years. In 2019, German defense spending increased by 10\u00a0percent, to $49.3 billion, the biggest increase among the world\u2019s 15 biggest military spenders, according to one analysis.However, that still amounts to only around 1.3 percent of GDP. Germany said in 2019 that it would reach its 2 percent NATO defense spending target by 2031, missing a 2024 deadline.ADGerman officials initially had been particularly rankled that they were not informed of the plans before they began to leak in the media, according to one U.S. official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations. \u201cWe are now at last talking to German officials about the issue,\u201d he said in the past week.German Defense Minister Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer has been in touch with U.S. colleagues regarding the plans, ministry spokesman Arne Collatz-Johannsen said. \u201cThe numbers have been communicated, but of course there are further details which have to be discussed,\u201d he said.Peter Beyer, the German government\u2019s transatlantic coordinator, said it was still possible the  plans will fall through.\u201cThere are many opponents in Washington, not only within the Democrats, but also with the Republicans and the Pentagon,\u201d he told German news agency DPA on Monday.Beyer  had sharp criticism for Washington's handling of the decision, saying it was \u201cunprecedented\u201d that the government found out about the move from a newspaper report.\n\n\n\n\n\nMorris reported from Berlin.

Subscribe today.arrow-rightThe rare metal has been used as an alloy to strengthen steel, aluminum and titanium in the construction, auto, aerospace and computer industries but must currently be imported \u2014 primarily from Austria, Canada and Russia.The Bureau of Land Management said in announcing plans earlier this month for the mine\u2019s expedited review that U.S. dependence on foreign vanadium \u201ccreates a strategic vulnerability for both the economy and military to adverse government action or other events that can disrupt the supply of this key mineral.\u201dADHenry Ford is credited with the first commercial application of vanadium when he used it to toughen the steel in the frame of the Model T in the early 1900s.ADVanadium has been extracted in small amounts in the U.S. but only as a minor byproduct of other mining operations, mostly uranium mines in Utah.China produces more than half the world\u2019s vanadium but consumes most of it domestically. China\u2019s recent move toward adopting standards for construction rebar metal rod standards as tough as those in the U.S. is a driving force in increased demand for the material valued for its high strength-to-weight ratio.The Nevada Vanadium Co. plans to mine about 10 million pounds (4.5 million kilograms) a year, or about half of the overall U.S. demand, on 10 square miles (2,589 hectares) land owned by the Bureau of Land Management about 200 miles (321 kilometers) east of Reno.ADThe Canadian-based company with an office in the tiny community of Eureka near the mine site plans also plans to extract about 50,000 pounds (22,679 kilograms) of yellow cake uranium annually, a concern to environmentalists who aren\u2019t worried about vanadium.ADEnriched yellow cake uranium can be used to make nuclear weapons or produce fuel for nuclear power plants.Environmental reviews for large mines can take years under normal regulatory schemes. But Bureau District Manager Doug Furtado is expecting a decision in about 12 months.\u201cIf approved, this project would provide hundreds of jobs and will contribute to the nation\u2019s domestic source of critical minerals,\u201d Furtado said.ADExpedited review is allowed under Trump\u2019s 2017 order directing the interior and commerce secretaries to develop a to protect and expand commercial access to critical minerals.The final list of the 35 designated minerals issued in May 2018 included vanadium, aluminum, lithium, magnesium, platinum, tungsten and uranium.In addition to airplanes and rockets, critical minerals are used to manufacture batteries, computer LCD screens, integrated circuits, optical devices and medical imaging.AD\u201cWithout them, the nation\u2019s economy would grind to a halt, and the technological edge maintained by the Armed Forces and intelligence community would erode,\u201d the agency said.ADNevada Vanadium Co. began developing plans for the mine five years ago. It submitted a management plan to the bureau in 2018.In addition to Chinese construction standards, demand is being driven by development of a unique vanadium flow battery showing promise for meeting future energy storage needs.Ron Espell, Nevada Vanadium\u2019s vice president for environment and sustainability, said vanadium mines historically have been cost-prohibitive in the U.S. because of the poor quality of deposits.Vanadium produced as a byproduct at uranium mines is especially impure, as is vanadium produced during the oil refining process. China extracts vanadium during steel slag production, but the resulting emissions are extremely high and far above what\u2019s legal under the U.S. Clean Air Act, Espell said.ADAD\u201cIt\u2019s all about the purity and it never pencils out economically,\u201d he said. \u201cThis one is unique. It\u2019s in the 98 to 99% percent pure range. It makes our project very attractive.\u201dThe mine would employ up to 120 construction workers starting as early as next year, followed by up to 120 mine employees.Environmentalists are concerned that the mine could hurt wildlife, including the imperiled greater sage grouse.\u201cGroundwater contamination in this area from uranium mining could spell catastrophe for the biodiversity there,\u201d said Patrick Donnelly, Nevada director of the Center for Biological Diversity.Uranium mining hasn\u2019t occurred in Nevada for years, Donnelly said. He said Nevada has a \u201ctroubled history with the nuclear industry,\u201d from atomic weapons detonations at the Nevada Test site to proposals to dump nuclear waste at Yucca Mountain.\u201cNevadans are going to be very wary of foreign mining companies inserting our public lands into the nuclear supply chain,\u201d he said.Copyright 2020 The Associated Press.

Subscribe today.arrow-rightBeing bigger\u00a0and more indispensable sounds like a great position to be in. Yet\u00a0that could also irk competition\u00a0regulators, clients and governments that, amid a tech cold war, worry that one company may have become too powerful.The way that TSMC\u00a0brushed off the pending loss of orders from Huawei Technologies Co. to raise its spending plan for the year is what had recently\u00a0impressed me. Then last week,\u00a0Intel Corp.\u00a0revealed\u00a0that its next, most-advanced chips would again be delayed, sending\u00a0the American company\u2019s\u00a0stock down 16%. As colleague Tae Kim noted,  investors have seen this movie before.\u00a0Intel has slipped up\u00a0too many times in recent years, allowing rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc. to take market share, and spurring Apple Inc. to drop Intel processors in favor of designing its own.Chief Executive Officer Bob Swan\u2019s statement that manufacturing the chips could be outsourced made it worse. Once the global leader in both design and production, Intel would be eliminating its\u00a0biggest competitive advantage against AMD \u2014\u00a0whose chips are made by TSMC \u2014\u00a0in their\u00a0tussle over\u00a0processors used in laptops, PCs and servers.\u00a0ADADThe\u00a0power shift was confirmed Monday morning.\u00a0TSMC jumped by its 10% daily limit in Taiwan\u00a0to a record high after the Taipei-based Commercial Times newspaper reported that Intel has placed an order for its 6 nanometer chips\u00a0for next year. Not only would this be an\u00a0unprecedented development for both client and supplier, the reported size of the contract \u2014\u00a0180,000 wafers \u2014\u00a0is almost as large as that for long-time client AMD (200,000 wafers), which raised its own order.\u00a0As a result, according to the newspaper, the manufacturer\u2019s leading-edge capacity is\u00a0fully booked for the first half of next year. A report in\u00a0Taipei\u2019s Economic Daily News\u00a0meanwhile\u00a0says that Apple will set up a display\u00a0R&D plant within TSMC. Recent advances\u00a0are starting to merge flat-screen display and semiconductor technologies, and the chipmaker finds itself at the center of the action.These new developments are where the responsibilities\u00a0of TSMC\u2019s crown will begin to weigh.\u00a0ADADIt has a long list of clients whose needs must be met. Beyond Apple and Intel, global leaders including Nvidia Corp., Qualcomm Inc., MediaTek Inc. and Broadcom Inc.\u00a0all rely on TSMC to churn out chips for the planet\u2019s\u00a0electronics devices. Great, except that expanding\u00a0takes years and billions of dollars. Overbuild and you\u2019re left with idle capacity that\u2019s quickly depreciating and burning a hole in your income statement.Another thing to keep in mind is that for all of Intel\u2019s woes, TSMC isn\u2019t perfect, either.In 2012,\u00a0Qualcomm struggled to supply a new line of chips to its own clients, smartphone brands,\u00a0because the Taiwanese company\u00a0was having trouble delivering on time. That spurred a search\u00a0for alternative suppliers. Two years ago, a malware attack and a separate incident involving poor chemical quality at TSMC both caused delays. By all accounts, clients forgave, but probably won\u2019t forget.ADADThen there are\u00a0regulators. The company told investors in 2017\u00a0that it was under preliminary investigation by the European Commission \u201cconcerning alleged anti-competitive practices\u2026\u00a0in relation to semiconductor sales.\u201d\u00a0The implication was that TSMC \u2014\u00a0holding more than 50% of the global contract-manufacturing market \u2014 is too big and powerful, with reports at the time suggesting that the U.S. Fair Trade Commission was also taking a look. While it seems both probes are on hold, there\u2019s every chance that either could be dusted off and restarted should concerns increase.The company has only grown bigger since, and\u00a0become an  unwilling player in the U.S.-China tech cold war.\u00a0It has\u00a0sought to ease\u00a0concerns that\u00a0so much American semiconductor prowess and supply sits offshore\u00a0by announcing that it will\u00a0build a factory in Arizona. Former Intel executive Peter Cleveland and U.S. Chamber of Commerce policy director Nicholas Montella have been hired to beef\u00a0up its U.S. lobbying team.\u00a0After decades behind the scenes, TSMC is\u00a0taking an ever-bigger share of the spotlight as one of\u00a0the most famous and powerful technology companies in the world. So far, it\u2019s managed to outsmart competitors, skirt antitrust regulators, and survive early rounds of the Washington-Beijing chill. This may make it a hero to investors and the ruler\u00a0of its sector, but also creates\u00a0a huge target.\u00a0This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tim Culpan is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering technology.

I determined ethnic inequality by measuring two aspects of each army: the demographic share represented by each ethnic group in the army, and the way in which the government treated each ethnic group in the prewar era. For this measure, I recorded whether the country was inclusive toward the ethnic group, discriminatory or repressive.Combining the two aspects creates an index that runs from 0 (perfect equality) to 1 (perfect inequality). Imagine, for example, an army with three ethnic groups divided between a favored group (50 percent of soldiers), a marginalized group (25 percent) and a repressed group (25 percent). This army would receive a military inequality score of 0.38.ADADThis means it is not enough for an army to be diverse \u2014 a country must also extend equal and full citizenship to the constituent ethnic groups in the army to reap the benefits of inclusion. The closer an army inches toward a score of 1, the worse its expected battlefield performance, as rising inequality saps the military cohesion necessary to wage modern war effectively.The Floyd protests will likely change public attitudes about race and policing. Here\u2019s why.How inequality makes armies less effectiveWhy is inequality in the military so harmful? Inequality erodes battlefield performance in four specific ways.First, shutting certain groups out of senior decision-making robs the army of diverse thinking, reinforcing a \u201cgroup think\u201d mentality that tends to lead to deadly conservatism on the battlefield.ADBy excluding certain voices, militaries saddled with high inequality become locked into predictable, usually second-best, tactics and approaches that leave them vulnerable to enemies.ADSecond, inequality means different ethnic groups have varying status, and this sows tensions and erodes trust among soldiers. In turn, this can hobble cooperation and coordination on chaotic battlefields.Third, soldiers drawn from targeted ethnic groups may suffer a loss of morale, making them less likely to fight for a government they distrust \u2014 and more likely to surrender.Fourth, prior exposure to government-directed discrimination or violence builds strong bonds among soldiers within the same ethnic group. Those who feel discriminated against may use these ties to organize escape or otherwise subvert military authorities. Military commanders may then be forced to devote greater resources to policing their own soldiers, creating new vulnerabilities that enemies could potentially exploit.ADADThe historical record shows that diverse armies fare betterThe perils of inequality are borne out by historical evidence. Since 1800, armies with high rates of inequality have done poorly, according to all kinds of measures of battlefield performance.In my statistical analysis, moving from low to high inequality, for example, increases the odds by 50 percent that an army will suffer more casualties than it inflicts on the other side. Similarly, the likelihood that large numbers of soldiers will desert the battlefield increases by a whopping 70 percent when looking at low-inequality vs. high-inequality armies. Defection \u2014 when soldiers switch sides and take up arms against their former comrades \u2014 is 60 percent more likely at high inequality than low.ADAnd armies with medium or greater inequality are far more likely to turn their weapons against their own soldiers. During World War II, for instance, the Soviet Union\u2019s Red Army, one of the world\u2019s most polyglot militaries, resorted to killing an estimated 158,000 of its own soldiers to force them to stand firm against Nazi forces.ADWe sometimes catch glimpses of armies rebuilding themselves during wartime. During the Korean War, for example, the desegregation of the U.S. Army improved the casualty survival rates of integrated regiments over whites-only units fielded early in the war.5 key lessons from the Taliban\u2019s deadly resurgence in AfghanistanProgress on equality can be reversed, however, with sharp consequences for battlefield conduct. Here\u2019s an example. The ragtag Mahdist state\u2019s inclusive armies managed to defeat superior Anglo-Egyptian forces in 1881-1885. But the death of the Mahdi leader in 1885 led to a recasting of the state and its military around a narrow ethnocratic vision that violently subjugated most of Sudan\u2019s population. The result? The bitterly divided Mahdist forces, often fighting under duress, were annihilated at Omdurman in 1898 \u2014 one of the most lopsided defeats in history.ADWhy this matters for the U.S. militaryADIn 2020, as the United States gears up for a return to \u201cgreat-power competition,\u201d the margin for error against a newly assertive China and revisionist Russia will continue to shrink. Building, retaining and fielding a diverse and truly inclusive military will remain a central challenge for the Defense Department.Removing the structural barriers to inclusion will be one important area of focus. Nonwhite personnel continue to be underrepresented at senior levels, a problem that worsens as one advances up the ranks. Women and nonwhite personnel also experience slower rates of promotion. Progress toward inclusion has also proceeded in fits and starts. Since 1945, the U.S. military has launched at least a half-dozen initiatives to stamp out racial inequalities.ADFor the U.S. military, investing in its people, not just military hardware, and redoubling a commitment to meaningful inclusion would bolster the war-fighting advantages of diversity.The TMC newsletter has moved!

Subscribe today.arrow-rightSince then, the evidence supporting that theory has only increased.In a special congressional election in New York\u2019s 27th District held late last month, Republican Chris Jacobs held a 40-point lead after votes were tallied on primary day. As tens of thousands of absentee ballots have been added to the count, though, Jacobs\u2019s edge has shrunk to 12 points, according to the Associated Press\u2019s latest results. The Democrat in the race, Nathan McMurray, has picked up 36,000 votes since primary day, while Jacobs has added just 22,000.ADADJacobs has already won the contest to replace Rep. Chris Collins (R-N.Y.), who resigned before pleading guilty to insider trading. But this was the congressional seat in which Trump performed the best among all 27 New York districts in 2016 \u2014 he carried it by 25 points \u2014 and it looks as though the GOP might manage to hold on to it by only single digits. That\u2019s not exactly a great omen.Thus far, this is the only federal special election since the vote-by-mail debate really kicked off amid the novel coronavirus pandemic. But it presages what could be a rough fall for Republicans as the president repeatedly rails against the alleged dangers \u2014 unsubstantiated \u2014 posed by mail-in votes while trying to make a distinction without a difference between them and absentee ballots, which he himself has used to vote in Florida.\u00a0The mail-in ballot issue is on the front burner because of the pandemic, which is spreading dangerously throughout the country and may or may not be worse in November. Some voters and poll workers, especially older ones, may be concerned about showing up physically to the polls, where the virus can spread more easily, on Election Day.The New York results mirror absentee ballot applications, polls and results in other states that have voted recently.\u00a0We don't yet have good data about absentee voting from runoffs last night in Alabama \u2014 where Trump nemesis Jeff Sessions lost to Tommy Tuberville in the GOP primary \u2014 and Texas, or in the Maine primary to face Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine). (Sara Gideon won.)ADADNew CBS News-YouGov polls this week in three battleground states Trump won in 2016 \u2014 Arizona, Florida and Texas \u2014 showed significant Democratic advantages among people who were planning to vote by mail. In Arizona, 80 percent of Democrats said they planned to vote by mail, while just 47 percent of Republicans said the same. In Florida, it was 56 percent to 28 percent, respectively. And in Texas, it was 39 percent to 15 percent.It\u2019s not unusual for Democrats to have an advantage in voting by mail, but not to this extent. And the CBS polls reinforced that.The polls also asked not just how people plan to vote this year but also how they usually cast their ballots. In Arizona, the number of Democrats who usually vote by mail was 64 percent, but it increased to 80 percent for those who plan to do so in this election. In Florida, 38 percent said they usually vote by mail, compared with 58 percent this time. And in Texas, the number jumped from 11 percent usually to 39 percent in 2020.ADADThe GOP, by contrast, saw no such increases in plans to vote by mail, and interestingly, the polls suggest some GOP voters might be less likely to vote by mail this time. In Arizona, while 51 percent of Republicans said they usually vote by mail, the number dropped to 47 percent when it came to people\u2019s plans for this year. In Florida, the number was 29 percent generally but 28 percent for this election. There was a slight uptick in interest in voting by mail among Texas Republicans, from 5 percent usually to 15 percent today, but nothing like the increase on the Democratic side.It\u2019s important to note that people may misrepresent their voting history or their plans for voting in 2020. But it\u2019s clear that, according to the voters themselves in key states, this has become a yawning gap.And that gap was confirmed this week by GOP pollster Glen Bolger, who said his polling of an undetermined swing state showed an even bigger chasm.\u201cYikes -- just finished a statewide survey in a swing state,\u201d Bolger tweeted Monday. \u201cThe quarter of the voters who plan to vote by mail or absentee break 15% Trump/75% Biden on the Pres. ballot. Republicans are skeptical about voting by mail, and that's a problem up and down ballot.\u201dADADPractically speaking, it\u2019s not clear how that might pan out in actual elections. But New York\u2019s special contest isn\u2019t the only recent example of Democratic mail-in voting surging in a way the GOP isn't matching.In Oklahoma\u2019s June 30 primary, for example, Democratic absentee votes increased from 4,400 in a 2014 Senate primary to 12,400 in the 2018 gubernatorial primary to nearly 57,000 in this year\u2019s Senate primary. That\u2019s nearly 13 times the number of absentee votes compared with the last time the same Senate seat was up six years ago.The GOP has also seen an increase, but of nowhere near this magnitude. It went from 8,900 absentee votes in 2014 to 15,300 in 2018 and 33,800 today \u2014 about four times the total from the previous primary for the same Senate seat six years ago.ADIn total, absentee votes accounted for 3 percent of total votes in each party\u2019s primaries in both 2014 and 2018. But in 2020, absentees accounted for 21 percent of Democratic votes, compared with 9 percent of GOP votes.ADThese numbers echo the gaps in primary absentee ballot requests that were detailed last week by Gardner and Dawsey in states like Georgia, Kentucky and Virginia. And the same dynamic is at play in Florida, where the GOP previously held an edge in absentee votes \u2014 including in 2016 \u2014 but where Democrats now have a sizable edge, 1.6 million to 1.2 million.The question is how much this all matters in November \u2014 both in the presidential race and congressional contests.\u00a0Republicans who are less concerned than Bolger have argued Democrats are merely cannibalizing voters who would otherwise just turn out to vote in person. Particularly in states that have robust early voting, the partisan mix of absentee votes is perhaps less of a concern. And data have suggested that voting by mail doesn\u2019t necessarily give one side or another a measurable edge.ADADThat said, this election provides an unprecedented X-factor: the coronavirus. If the outbreak looms into November in key states, turning out to vote in person may not be as attractive, and banking votes via mail-in ballots may prove more important. That said, Republicans are generally less concerned about the virus than Democrats, and they might be willing to turn out to vote in person in a way Democrats won\u2019t.Either way, the debate speaks to the importance of Democrats banking as many mail-in votes as they can, which virtually all signs suggest they are doing in a way Republicans aren\u2019t.What\u2019s clear is that it\u2019s a dynamic well worth watching \u2014 and one that is clearly worrying plenty of Republicans.More on the electionsSessions lost the GOP runoff election in Alabama to football coach Tuberville.\u00a0Just five years ago, Sessions, then a senator from Alabama, became the first Republican senator to endorse Trump\u2019s presidential campaign. \u201cThat once remarkable bond came to a crashing end Tuesday night when the Associated Press declared that Tuberville had defeated Sessions in the runoff to be the Republican nominee in November\u2019s Senate race against Sen. Doug Jones (D-Ala.). The result culminated four months of Trump imploring Alabama\u2019s voters to reject Sessions, the man who the president once said he leaned on for advice in forming his \u2018America First\u2019 agenda,\u201d Paul Kane and Toluse Olorunnipa report. \u201cRunning for his old Senate seat \u2014 which he abandoned in early 2017 to become Trump\u2019s attorney general \u2014 Sessions endured one brutal insult after another from the president. \u2026\u00a0ADAD\u201cTrump chose not to rub too much salt into Sessions\u2019s wounds Tuesday night, but he quickly hailed Tuberville\u2019s victory. \u2018Tommy Tuberville WON big against Jeff Sessions. Will be a GREAT Senator for the incredible people of Alabama,\u2019 Trump tweeted. \u2026 [Tuberville\u2019s] victory was declared quickly \u2014 a final humiliation for Sessions, who was once so untouchable that Alabama Democrats didn\u2019t field an opponent against him in his 2014 reelection. \u2026 Emerging from casting his own ballot Tuesday morning, Sessions made one final, almost sad, assertion that he would be a Trump purist if he won his old seat back, noting that several staunch conservatives had overcome the president\u2019s endorsement of other candidates in recent weeks.\u201d\u00a0Air Force veteran MJ Hegar will challenge Sen. John Cornyn (R-Tex.) in November.\u00a0\u201cHegar, whose biography helped her nearly win a congressional seat in 2018, was long considered the favorite, but a late charge from state Sen. Royce West forced outside groups backing Hegar to pour money into the race to get her over the finish line,\u201d Paul Kane and Colby Itkowitz report. \u201cAlso in Texas, former White House physician Ronny L. Jackson won the nomination to replace Rep. Mac Thornberry (R) in one of the most conservative districts in the nation. \u2026 Pete Sessions, who had been in the House for 22 years before losing in the Democratic wave of 2018, won the chance to compete to return to Congress. Rather than run for his old seat in the suburbs of Dallas, Sessions moved 100 miles south to run in a more conservative district. He failed to win the primary outright, facing Renee Swann, a political outsider who was backed by the district\u2019s current congressman, retiring Rep. Bill Flores (R), in Tuesday\u2019s runoff. The Republican runoff to replace retiring Rep. Will Hurd (R) in a Texas district Democrats believe is within reach was still too close to call.\u201d\u00a0ADADIn Maine, state House Speaker Gideon won the Democratic primary and will face Collins. Millions of dollars have already poured into that race, both to the Democrat\u2019s coffers and from outside groups eager to oust Collins.\u00a0Republican Rep. Steve Watkins of Kansas was charged with three felonies in connection to a voter fraud investigation.\u00a0\u201cWatkins was charged with three felony counts in Shawnee County, Kan., late Tuesday, nearly eight months after a newspaper investigation found that he listed the location of a UPS Store as his address for voting purposes on government forms,\u201d Elise Viebeck and David Weigel report. \u201cWatkins, a freshman Republican from Topeka, faces two felony charges related to unlawful voting and one related to interference with law enforcement and providing false information, according to a news release from Shawnee County District Attorney Michael F. Kagay. The charges stem from a 2019 local election, the release stated. The case emerged after an investigation of a\u00a0Topeka Capital-Journal report\u00a0from December, which stated that Watkins may have committed felony voter fraud by allegedly misstating his address on a voter change-of-residency form. \u2026 With just three weeks until his primary, Watkins shrugged off the announcement Tuesday, calling the errors an innocent mistake and saying he looks forward to \u2018setting the record straight.\u2019 \u2018This is clearly hyper-political,\u2019 he said during a televised debate that began shortly after news broke about the charges. \u2018I haven\u2019t done anything wrong.\u2019\u201dTrump used an event at the Rose Garden for an extended campaign-like attack on Joe Biden.\u00a0\u201cTrump lambasted Biden\u2019s record on Beijing, casting [him] as soft on China during its rise to become the second-largest economy in the world. He faulted Biden for initially opposing his administration\u2019s decision to shut down some flights from China over the coronavirus, and he inaccurately stated that Biden \u2018sided with China\u2019 on its handling of the pandemic \u2014 even though Biden had sounded alarms months ago as Trump was still praising Chinese President Xi Jinping. \u2026 Trump didn\u2019t stop there, adding an attack on Biden\u2019s son Hunter,\u201d David Nakamura, Toluse Olorunnipa and Philip Rucker report.\u201cTrump dumped almost an hour\u2019s worth of opposition research against his Democratic rival with less than four months to go before the election, hitting him over immigration, energy policy and the environment. \u2018There\u2019s probably never been a time when candidates are so different,\u2019 Trump said. \u2026 The president said he had asked some of his \u2018people\u2019 for a list of Biden\u2019s platform issues before proceeding to read out several liberal policy proposals. The list mirrored a lengthy Twitter thread posted last week by Trump\u2019s son Donald Trump Jr., in which he described the \u2018Biden-Sanders\u2019 agenda as \u2018insane.\u2019 Much of Trump\u2019s summary of Biden\u2019s policy proposals was false or misleading.\u201dThe Rose Garden event was meant to mark Trump\u2019s signing of a bill to punish China over Hong Kong.\u00a0\u201cThe bill Trump signed, which unanimously passed Congress last week, imposes sanctions on China over its ongoing crackdown on Hong Kong, where officials have imposed a sweeping national security law that allows Beijing to target political opponents in the once-autonomous city. Under the new standard, Hong Kongers who are deemed guilty of \u2018subversion\u2019 face a possible life sentence in prison \u2014 the same as political dissidents in mainland China,\u201d Colby Itkowitz reports. \u201cTrump also issued an executive order ending the United States\u2019 longtime preferential treatment of Hong Kong, saying it would now be treated the same as mainland China with regard to economic and other issues.'Meanwhile, Biden shared a new $2 trillion climate plan.\u00a0\u201cThe plan would significantly reduce the United States\u2019 reliance on fossil fuels, and the 15-year timeline for a 100 percent clean electricity standard is far more ambitious than anything Biden has previously proposed. It was Biden\u2019s latest attempt to channel the liberal energy in his party, as well as a response to calls for sweeping plans to lift a struggling economy. The blueprint was quickly hailed by environmentalists and liberals as a big step forward in the climate effort, and just as quickly denounced by Republicans as an unwieldy plan that would raise energy costs,\u201d Matt Viser and Dino Grandoni report. \u201cThe Trump campaign was quick to go after Biden\u2019s proposal Tuesday. \u2018His plan is more like a socialist manifesto that promises to massively raise taxes, eliminate jobs in the coal, oil or natural gas industries, and crush the middle class,\u2019 said Hogan Gidley, the campaign\u2019s national press secretary.\u201d\u00a0The coronavirusThe global surge in coronavirus cases is being fed by the developing world \u2014 and the U.S., with its 3,410,000 cases.\u00a0\u201cPoorer nations throughout Latin America, the Middle East, South Asia and Africa are bearing a growing share of the caseload, even as wealthier countries in Western Europe and East Asia enjoy a relative respite after having beaten back the worst effects through rigorously enforced lockdowns. And then there\u2019s the United States, which leads the world in new cases and, as with many nations that possess far fewer resources, has shown no sign of being able to regain control,\u201d Griff Witte, Mary Beth Sheridan, Joanna Slater and Liz Sly report. \u201cThe severity of the toll on the United States was evident in new infection figures released Tuesday, with multiple states \u2014 including Oklahoma and Nevada \u2014 hitting record highs. Florida has now reported more cases in the past week \u2014 nearly 78,000 \u2014 than most European nations have in their entire struggle with covid-19, the illness caused by the novel coronavirus.\u00a0\u201cThat sort of explosive growth is mirrored in other nations, though none with the sort of wealth, infrastructure and scientific know-how of the United States. Across much of the developing world, rampant coronavirus outbreaks came relatively late. But now that the virus has taken root, governments are flailing in their attempts to halt it and citizens are resisting changes to their way of life. \u2026 The struggle has been especially fraught in Latin America, where countries have been lashed by covid-19\u2019s ferocity and many have not yet hit their peaks. Brazil has the second-highest number of covid-19 deaths in the world, at more than 74,000, while Mexico has the fourth-highest, with more than 37,000. (The United States, with at least 133,000 deaths, is far and away the global leader.)\u201dStarting today, a new data reporting protocol for hospitals will eliminate the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as a recipient of state coronavirus data. The administration is instead encouraging governors to use the National Guard to collect this data, Lena Sun and Amy Goldstein report. The move leaves health-care institutions to report information daily to a federal contractor or to their state, which would coordinate the federal reporting. Public experts say bypassing the CDC could harm the quality of data and the federal response to the pandemic.\u00a0The first vaccine tested in the U.S. boosted people\u2019s immune systems just the way scientists hoped it would.\u00a0\u201c\u2018No matter how you slice this, this is good news,\u2019 [said] Anthony Fauci,\u201d the AP reports. \u201cThe experimental vaccine, developed by Fauci\u2019s colleagues at the National Institutes of Health and Moderna Inc., will start its most important step around July 27: A 30,000-person study to prove if the shots really are strong enough to protect against the coronavirus. But Tuesday, researchers reported anxiously awaited findings from the first 45 volunteers who rolled up their sleeves back in March. Sure enough, the vaccine provided a hoped-for immune boost. Those early volunteers developed what are called neutralizing antibodies in their bloodstream \u2014 molecules key to blocking infection \u2014 at levels comparable to those found in people who survived COVID-19, the research team reported in the New England Journal of Medicine.\u201d\u00a0White House trade adviser Peter Navarro attacked Fauci in an op-ed for USA Today, part of a continuing campaign against the doctor by Trump and his allies.\u00a0\u201cDr. Anthony Fauci has a good bedside manner with the public, but he has been wrong about everything I have interacted with him on,\u201d Navarro wrote. \u201cSo when you ask me whether I listen to Dr. Fauci\u2019s advice, my answer is: only with skepticism and caution.\u201dIn response to White House attacks, Fauci said the public can trust him.\u00a0\u201cI believe, for the most part, you can trust respected medical authorities,\u201d Fauci said during a Georgetown Institute of Politics and Public Service event. \u201cI believe I\u2019m one of them, so I think you can trust me.\u201dFormer Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman Joseph Dunford Jr. won\u2019t chair a coronavirus spending panel. Dunford Jr. removed himself from consideration to chair the Congressional Oversight Commission, a key mechanism created by Congress that is supposed to scrutinize coronavirus spending, Erica Werner reports. The reasons for his withdrawal were unclear, but the decision is a major setback for the commission and efforts to find someone to lead it. Under the coronavirus stimulus legislation, the chair of the bipartisan five-member commission must be appointed jointly by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.). \u00a0Quote of the day\u201cWe don\u2019t want CDC guidance to be a reason why people don\u2019t reopen their schools,\u201d said Vice President Pence during a roundtable discussion at Louisiana State University, where he emphasized the Trump administration\u2019s position that schools at all levels need to open this fall. (Des Bieler)\u00a0The Trump administration backed off a plan that would\u2019ve required international students to take face-to-face classes.\u00a0\u201cThe abrupt reversal, disclosed in a federal court in Boston, came a little more than a week after U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement issued an edict that stunned U.S. higher education leaders and students worldwide,\u201d Nick Anderson and Susan Svrluga report. \u201cUnder the July 6 policy from ICE, international students enrolled in U.S. colleges and universities for the fall semester faced a mandate to take at least one course in person. Those students, ICE said, \u2018may not take a full online course load and remain in the United States.\u2019 That mandate posed a major obstacle to plans for online teaching and learning that colleges are developing in response to the novel coronavirus pandemic. In the spring, the federal government had given schools much more leeway to teach international students online. Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology had sued to block the new policy. In a hearing in that case on Tuesday, held before U.S. District Judge Allison D. Burroughs, the judge announced that the schools and the federal government had reached an agreement that made the lawsuit moot.\u201d\u00a0A new White House ad campaign tells 18 million unemployed workers that maybe they just have to \u201cFind Something New.\u201d\u00a0\u201cIvanka Trump urged out-of-work Americans to \u2018find something new\u2019 Tuesday as part of a new jobs initiative designed to tout the benefits of skills training and career paths that don\u2019t require a college degree. But the effort \u2014 complete with a website, advertising campaign and virtual roundtable featuring Apple CEO Tim Cook and IBM chair Ginni Rometty \u2014 was swiftly derided on social media as \u2018clueless\u2019 and \u2018tone-deaf\u2019 given the pandemic, recession and Trump\u2019s own familial employment history,\u201d Hamza Shaban reports. \u201cThe nation currently has 5.4 million job openings, according to the Labor Department, which is not nearly enough for the roughly 18 million Americans who are officially unemployed and the 33 million who are currently receiving unemployment benefits. Many saw the campaign as insensitive given the suffering of Americans whose livelihoods disappeared as the pandemic forced companies to shutter or sharply curtail operations. And for many, Ivanka Trump \u2014 the daughter of a billionaire and a multimillionaire in her own right \u2014 is the wrong person to speak to the challenges of finding a job.\u201dFaulty data collection has raised questions about the administration\u2019s Paycheck Protection Program claims.\u00a0\u201cA Post analysis of data on 4.9 million loans released last week by the Small Business Administration shows that many companies are reported to have \u2018retained\u2019 far more workers than they employ. Likewise, in some cases the agency\u2019s jobs claim for entire industries surpasses the total number of workers in those sectors. And for more than 875,000 borrowers, the data shows that zero jobs were supported or no information is listed at all, according to the analysis,\u201d Jonathan O\u2019Connell, Emma Brown, Steven Rich and Aaron Gregg report. \u201cThe flaws raise questions about the claims by the Trump administration that 51 million jobs were \u2018supported\u2019 by the [PPP].\u201dThe federal stockpile is thinning out amid the case surge.\u201cThe federal government may not have the capacity to supply medical professionals with personal protective equipment amid the latest surge in coronavirus cases, according to internal administration documents,\u201d NBC News reports. \u201cFor example, the Strategic National Stockpile and the Federal Emergency Management Agency have fewer than 900,000 gloves in reserve after shipping 82.7 million of them \u2014 or just 30 percent of the amount requested by state, local and tribal governments \u2014 since the COVID-19 crisis began. \u2026 Nonetheless, Adm. John Polowczyk, the chief supply-chain official for the White House coronavirus task force, maintained in an interview with NBC News on Tuesday that the supply situation is \u2018just not that dire.\u2019\u201dTexas hospitals are running out of drugs, beds, ventilators and staff.

Subscribe today.arrow-rightSince then, the evidence supporting that theory has only increased.In a special congressional election in New York\u2019s 27th District held late last month, Republican Chris Jacobs held a 40-point lead after votes were tallied on primary day. As tens of thousands of absentee ballots have been added to the count, though, Jacobs\u2019s edge has shrunk to 12 points, according to the Associated Press\u2019s latest results. The Democrat in the race, Nathan McMurray, has picked up 36,000 votes since primary day, while Jacobs has added just 22,000.ADADJacobs has already won the contest to replace Rep. Chris Collins (R-N.Y.), who resigned before pleading guilty to insider trading. But this was the congressional seat in which Trump performed the best among all 27 New York districts in 2016 \u2014 he carried it by 25 points \u2014 and it looks as though the GOP might manage to hold on to it by only single digits. That\u2019s not exactly a great omen.Thus far, this is the only federal special election since the vote-by-mail debate really kicked off amid the novel coronavirus pandemic. But it presages what could be a rough fall for Republicans as the president repeatedly rails against the alleged dangers \u2014 unsubstantiated \u2014 posed by mail-in votes while trying to make a distinction without a difference between them and absentee ballots, which he himself has used to vote in Florida.\u00a0The mail-in ballot issue is on the front burner because of the pandemic, which is spreading dangerously throughout the country and may or may not be worse in November. Some voters and poll workers, especially older ones, may be concerned about showing up physically to the polls, where the virus can spread more easily, on Election Day.The New York results mirror absentee ballot applications, polls and results in other states that have voted recently.\u00a0We don't yet have good data about absentee voting from runoffs last night in Alabama \u2014 where Trump nemesis Jeff Sessions lost to Tommy Tuberville in the GOP primary \u2014 and Texas, or in the Maine primary to face Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine). (Sara Gideon won.)ADADNew CBS News-YouGov polls this week in three battleground states Trump won in 2016 \u2014 Arizona, Florida and Texas \u2014 showed significant Democratic advantages among people who were planning to vote by mail. In Arizona, 80 percent of Democrats said they planned to vote by mail, while just 47 percent of Republicans said the same. In Florida, it was 56 percent to 28 percent, respectively. And in Texas, it was 39 percent to 15 percent.It\u2019s not unusual for Democrats to have an advantage in voting by mail, but not to this extent. And the CBS polls reinforced that.The polls also asked not just how people plan to vote this year but also how they usually cast their ballots. In Arizona, the number of Democrats who usually vote by mail was 64 percent, but it increased to 80 percent for those who plan to do so in this election. In Florida, 38 percent said they usually vote by mail, compared with 58 percent this time. And in Texas, the number jumped from 11 percent usually to 39 percent in 2020.ADADThe GOP, by contrast, saw no such increases in plans to vote by mail, and interestingly, the polls suggest some GOP voters might be less likely to vote by mail this time. In Arizona, while 51 percent of Republicans said they usually vote by mail, the number dropped to 47 percent when it came to people\u2019s plans for this year. In Florida, the number was 29 percent generally but 28 percent for this election. There was a slight uptick in interest in voting by mail among Texas Republicans, from 5 percent usually to 15 percent today, but nothing like the increase on the Democratic side.It\u2019s important to note that people may misrepresent their voting history or their plans for voting in 2020. But it\u2019s clear that, according to the voters themselves in key states, this has become a yawning gap.And that gap was confirmed this week by GOP pollster Glen Bolger, who said his polling of an undetermined swing state showed an even bigger chasm.\u201cYikes -- just finished a statewide survey in a swing state,\u201d Bolger tweeted Monday. \u201cThe quarter of the voters who plan to vote by mail or absentee break 15% Trump/75% Biden on the Pres. ballot. Republicans are skeptical about voting by mail, and that's a problem up and down ballot.\u201dADADPractically speaking, it\u2019s not clear how that might pan out in actual elections. But New York\u2019s special contest isn\u2019t the only recent example of Democratic mail-in voting surging in a way the GOP isn't matching.In Oklahoma\u2019s June 30 primary, for example, Democratic absentee votes increased from 4,400 in a 2014 Senate primary to 12,400 in the 2018 gubernatorial primary to nearly 57,000 in this year\u2019s Senate primary. That\u2019s nearly 13 times the number of absentee votes compared with the last time the same Senate seat was up six years ago.The GOP has also seen an increase, but of nowhere near this magnitude. It went from 8,900 absentee votes in 2014 to 15,300 in 2018 and 33,800 today \u2014 about four times the total from the previous primary for the same Senate seat six years ago.ADIn total, absentee votes accounted for 3 percent of total votes in each party\u2019s primaries in both 2014 and 2018. But in 2020, absentees accounted for 21 percent of Democratic votes, compared with 9 percent of GOP votes.ADThese numbers echo the gaps in primary absentee ballot requests that were detailed last week by Gardner and Dawsey in states like Georgia, Kentucky and Virginia. And the same dynamic is at play in Florida, where the GOP previously held an edge in absentee votes \u2014 including in 2016 \u2014 but where Democrats now have a sizable edge, 1.6 million to 1.2 million.The question is how much this all matters in November \u2014 both in the presidential race and congressional contests.\u00a0Republicans who are less concerned than Bolger have argued Democrats are merely cannibalizing voters who would otherwise just turn out to vote in person. Particularly in states that have robust early voting, the partisan mix of absentee votes is perhaps less of a concern. And data have suggested that voting by mail doesn\u2019t necessarily give one side or another a measurable edge.ADADThat said, this election provides an unprecedented X-factor: the coronavirus. If the outbreak looms into November in key states, turning out to vote in person may not be as attractive, and banking votes via mail-in ballots may prove more important. That said, Republicans are generally less concerned about the virus than Democrats, and they might be willing to turn out to vote in person in a way Democrats won\u2019t.Either way, the debate speaks to the importance of Democrats banking as many mail-in votes as they can, which virtually all signs suggest they are doing in a way Republicans aren\u2019t.What\u2019s clear is that it\u2019s a dynamic well worth watching \u2014 and one that is clearly worrying plenty of Republicans.More on the electionsSessions lost the GOP runoff election in Alabama to football coach Tuberville.\u00a0Just five years ago, Sessions, then a senator from Alabama, became the first Republican senator to endorse Trump\u2019s presidential campaign. \u201cThat once remarkable bond came to a crashing end Tuesday night when the Associated Press declared that Tuberville had defeated Sessions in the runoff to be the Republican nominee in November\u2019s Senate race against Sen. Doug Jones (D-Ala.). The result culminated four months of Trump imploring Alabama\u2019s voters to reject Sessions, the man who the president once said he leaned on for advice in forming his \u2018America First\u2019 agenda,\u201d Paul Kane and Toluse Olorunnipa report. \u201cRunning for his old Senate seat \u2014 which he abandoned in early 2017 to become Trump\u2019s attorney general \u2014 Sessions endured one brutal insult after another from the president. \u2026\u00a0ADAD\u201cTrump chose not to rub too much salt into Sessions\u2019s wounds Tuesday night, but he quickly hailed Tuberville\u2019s victory. \u2018Tommy Tuberville WON big against Jeff Sessions. Will be a GREAT Senator for the incredible people of Alabama,\u2019 Trump tweeted. \u2026 [Tuberville\u2019s] victory was declared quickly \u2014 a final humiliation for Sessions, who was once so untouchable that Alabama Democrats didn\u2019t field an opponent against him in his 2014 reelection. \u2026 Emerging from casting his own ballot Tuesday morning, Sessions made one final, almost sad, assertion that he would be a Trump purist if he won his old seat back, noting that several staunch conservatives had overcome the president\u2019s endorsement of other candidates in recent weeks.\u201d\u00a0Air Force veteran MJ Hegar will challenge Sen. John Cornyn (R-Tex.) in November.\u00a0\u201cHegar, whose biography helped her nearly win a congressional seat in 2018, was long considered the favorite, but a late charge from state Sen. Royce West forced outside groups backing Hegar to pour money into the race to get her over the finish line,\u201d Paul Kane and Colby Itkowitz report. \u201cAlso in Texas, former White House physician Ronny L. Jackson won the nomination to replace Rep. Mac Thornberry (R) in one of the most conservative districts in the nation. \u2026 Pete Sessions, who had been in the House for 22 years before losing in the Democratic wave of 2018, won the chance to compete to return to Congress. Rather than run for his old seat in the suburbs of Dallas, Sessions moved 100 miles south to run in a more conservative district. He failed to win the primary outright, facing Renee Swann, a political outsider who was backed by the district\u2019s current congressman, retiring Rep. Bill Flores (R), in Tuesday\u2019s runoff. The Republican runoff to replace retiring Rep. Will Hurd (R) in a Texas district Democrats believe is within reach was still too close to call.\u201d\u00a0ADADIn Maine, state House Speaker Gideon won the Democratic primary and will face Collins. Millions of dollars have already poured into that race, both to the Democrat\u2019s coffers and from outside groups eager to oust Collins.\u00a0Republican Rep. Steve Watkins of Kansas was charged with three felonies in connection to a voter fraud investigation.\u00a0\u201cWatkins was charged with three felony counts in Shawnee County, Kan., late Tuesday, nearly eight months after a newspaper investigation found that he listed the location of a UPS Store as his address for voting purposes on government forms,\u201d Elise Viebeck and David Weigel report. \u201cWatkins, a freshman Republican from Topeka, faces two felony charges related to unlawful voting and one related to interference with law enforcement and providing false information, according to a news release from Shawnee County District Attorney Michael F. Kagay. The charges stem from a 2019 local election, the release stated. The case emerged after an investigation of a\u00a0Topeka Capital-Journal report\u00a0from December, which stated that Watkins may have committed felony voter fraud by allegedly misstating his address on a voter change-of-residency form. \u2026 With just three weeks until his primary, Watkins shrugged off the announcement Tuesday, calling the errors an innocent mistake and saying he looks forward to \u2018setting the record straight.\u2019 \u2018This is clearly hyper-political,\u2019 he said during a televised debate that began shortly after news broke about the charges. \u2018I haven\u2019t done anything wrong.\u2019\u201dTrump used an event at the Rose Garden for an extended campaign-like attack on Joe Biden.\u00a0\u201cTrump lambasted Biden\u2019s record on Beijing, casting [him] as soft on China during its rise to become the second-largest economy in the world. He faulted Biden for initially opposing his administration\u2019s decision to shut down some flights from China over the coronavirus, and he inaccurately stated that Biden \u2018sided with China\u2019 on its handling of the pandemic \u2014 even though Biden had sounded alarms months ago as Trump was still praising Chinese President Xi Jinping. \u2026 Trump didn\u2019t stop there, adding an attack on Biden\u2019s son Hunter,\u201d David Nakamura, Toluse Olorunnipa and Philip Rucker report.\u201cTrump dumped almost an hour\u2019s worth of opposition research against his Democratic rival with less than four months to go before the election, hitting him over immigration, energy policy and the environment. \u2018There\u2019s probably never been a time when candidates are so different,\u2019 Trump said. \u2026 The president said he had asked some of his \u2018people\u2019 for a list of Biden\u2019s platform issues before proceeding to read out several liberal policy proposals. The list mirrored a lengthy Twitter thread posted last week by Trump\u2019s son Donald Trump Jr., in which he described the \u2018Biden-Sanders\u2019 agenda as \u2018insane.\u2019 Much of Trump\u2019s summary of Biden\u2019s policy proposals was false or misleading.\u201dThe Rose Garden event was meant to mark Trump\u2019s signing of a bill to punish China over Hong Kong.\u00a0\u201cThe bill Trump signed, which unanimously passed Congress last week, imposes sanctions on China over its ongoing crackdown on Hong Kong, where officials have imposed a sweeping national security law that allows Beijing to target political opponents in the once-autonomous city. Under the new standard, Hong Kongers who are deemed guilty of \u2018subversion\u2019 face a possible life sentence in prison \u2014 the same as political dissidents in mainland China,\u201d Colby Itkowitz reports. \u201cTrump also issued an executive order ending the United States\u2019 longtime preferential treatment of Hong Kong, saying it would now be treated the same as mainland China with regard to economic and other issues.'Meanwhile, Biden shared a new $2 trillion climate plan.\u00a0\u201cThe plan would significantly reduce the United States\u2019 reliance on fossil fuels, and the 15-year timeline for a 100 percent clean electricity standard is far more ambitious than anything Biden has previously proposed. It was Biden\u2019s latest attempt to channel the liberal energy in his party, as well as a response to calls for sweeping plans to lift a struggling economy. The blueprint was quickly hailed by environmentalists and liberals as a big step forward in the climate effort, and just as quickly denounced by Republicans as an unwieldy plan that would raise energy costs,\u201d Matt Viser and Dino Grandoni report. \u201cThe Trump campaign was quick to go after Biden\u2019s proposal Tuesday. \u2018His plan is more like a socialist manifesto that promises to massively raise taxes, eliminate jobs in the coal, oil or natural gas industries, and crush the middle class,\u2019 said Hogan Gidley, the campaign\u2019s national press secretary.\u201d\u00a0The coronavirusThe global surge in coronavirus cases is being fed by the developing world \u2014 and the U.S., with its 3,410,000 cases.\u00a0\u201cPoorer nations throughout Latin America, the Middle East, South Asia and Africa are bearing a growing share of the caseload, even as wealthier countries in Western Europe and East Asia enjoy a relative respite after having beaten back the worst effects through rigorously enforced lockdowns. And then there\u2019s the United States, which leads the world in new cases and, as with many nations that possess far fewer resources, has shown no sign of being able to regain control,\u201d Griff Witte, Mary Beth Sheridan, Joanna Slater and Liz Sly report. \u201cThe severity of the toll on the United States was evident in new infection figures released Tuesday, with multiple states \u2014 including Oklahoma and Nevada \u2014 hitting record highs. Florida has now reported more cases in the past week \u2014 nearly 78,000 \u2014 than most European nations have in their entire struggle with covid-19, the illness caused by the novel coronavirus.\u00a0\u201cThat sort of explosive growth is mirrored in other nations, though none with the sort of wealth, infrastructure and scientific know-how of the United States. Across much of the developing world, rampant coronavirus outbreaks came relatively late. But now that the virus has taken root, governments are flailing in their attempts to halt it and citizens are resisting changes to their way of life. \u2026 The struggle has been especially fraught in Latin America, where countries have been lashed by covid-19\u2019s ferocity and many have not yet hit their peaks. Brazil has the second-highest number of covid-19 deaths in the world, at more than 74,000, while Mexico has the fourth-highest, with more than 37,000. (The United States, with at least 133,000 deaths, is far and away the global leader.)\u201dStarting today, a new data reporting protocol for hospitals will eliminate the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as a recipient of state coronavirus data. The administration is instead encouraging governors to use the National Guard to collect this data, Lena Sun and Amy Goldstein report. The move leaves health-care institutions to report information daily to a federal contractor or to their state, which would coordinate the federal reporting. Public experts say bypassing the CDC could harm the quality of data and the federal response to the pandemic.\u00a0The first vaccine tested in the U.S. boosted people\u2019s immune systems just the way scientists hoped it would.\u00a0\u201c\u2018No matter how you slice this, this is good news,\u2019 [said] Anthony Fauci,\u201d the AP reports. \u201cThe experimental vaccine, developed by Fauci\u2019s colleagues at the National Institutes of Health and Moderna Inc., will start its most important step around July 27: A 30,000-person study to prove if the shots really are strong enough to protect against the coronavirus. But Tuesday, researchers reported anxiously awaited findings from the first 45 volunteers who rolled up their sleeves back in March. Sure enough, the vaccine provided a hoped-for immune boost. Those early volunteers developed what are called neutralizing antibodies in their bloodstream \u2014 molecules key to blocking infection \u2014 at levels comparable to those found in people who survived COVID-19, the research team reported in the New England Journal of Medicine.\u201d\u00a0White House trade adviser Peter Navarro attacked Fauci in an op-ed for USA Today, part of a continuing campaign against the doctor by Trump and his allies.\u00a0\u201cDr. Anthony Fauci has a good bedside manner with the public, but he has been wrong about everything I have interacted with him on,\u201d Navarro wrote. \u201cSo when you ask me whether I listen to Dr. Fauci\u2019s advice, my answer is: only with skepticism and caution.\u201dIn response to White House attacks, Fauci said the public can trust him.\u00a0\u201cI believe, for the most part, you can trust respected medical authorities,\u201d Fauci said during a Georgetown Institute of Politics and Public Service event. \u201cI believe I\u2019m one of them, so I think you can trust me.\u201dFormer Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman Joseph Dunford Jr. won\u2019t chair a coronavirus spending panel. Dunford Jr. removed himself from consideration to chair the Congressional Oversight Commission, a key mechanism created by Congress that is supposed to scrutinize coronavirus spending, Erica Werner reports. The reasons for his withdrawal were unclear, but the decision is a major setback for the commission and efforts to find someone to lead it. Under the coronavirus stimulus legislation, the chair of the bipartisan five-member commission must be appointed jointly by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.). \u00a0Quote of the day\u201cWe don\u2019t want CDC guidance to be a reason why people don\u2019t reopen their schools,\u201d said Vice President Pence during a roundtable discussion at Louisiana State University, where he emphasized the Trump administration\u2019s position that schools at all levels need to open this fall. (Des Bieler)\u00a0The Trump administration backed off a plan that would\u2019ve required international students to take face-to-face classes.\u00a0\u201cThe abrupt reversal, disclosed in a federal court in Boston, came a little more than a week after U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement issued an edict that stunned U.S. higher education leaders and students worldwide,\u201d Nick Anderson and Susan Svrluga report. \u201cUnder the July 6 policy from ICE, international students enrolled in U.S. colleges and universities for the fall semester faced a mandate to take at least one course in person. Those students, ICE said, \u2018may not take a full online course load and remain in the United States.\u2019 That mandate posed a major obstacle to plans for online teaching and learning that colleges are developing in response to the novel coronavirus pandemic. In the spring, the federal government had given schools much more leeway to teach international students online. Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology had sued to block the new policy. In a hearing in that case on Tuesday, held before U.S. District Judge Allison D. Burroughs, the judge announced that the schools and the federal government had reached an agreement that made the lawsuit moot.\u201d\u00a0A new White House ad campaign tells 18 million unemployed workers that maybe they just have to \u201cFind Something New.\u201d\u00a0\u201cIvanka Trump urged out-of-work Americans to \u2018find something new\u2019 Tuesday as part of a new jobs initiative designed to tout the benefits of skills training and career paths that don\u2019t require a college degree. But the effort \u2014 complete with a website, advertising campaign and virtual roundtable featuring Apple CEO Tim Cook and IBM chair Ginni Rometty \u2014 was swiftly derided on social media as \u2018clueless\u2019 and \u2018tone-deaf\u2019 given the pandemic, recession and Trump\u2019s own familial employment history,\u201d Hamza Shaban reports. \u201cThe nation currently has 5.4 million job openings, according to the Labor Department, which is not nearly enough for the roughly 18 million Americans who are officially unemployed and the 33 million who are currently receiving unemployment benefits. Many saw the campaign as insensitive given the suffering of Americans whose livelihoods disappeared as the pandemic forced companies to shutter or sharply curtail operations. And for many, Ivanka Trump \u2014 the daughter of a billionaire and a multimillionaire in her own right \u2014 is the wrong person to speak to the challenges of finding a job.\u201dFaulty data collection has raised questions about the administration\u2019s Paycheck Protection Program claims.\u00a0\u201cA Post analysis of data on 4.9 million loans released last week by the Small Business Administration shows that many companies are reported to have \u2018retained\u2019 far more workers than they employ. Likewise, in some cases the agency\u2019s jobs claim for entire industries surpasses the total number of workers in those sectors. And for more than 875,000 borrowers, the data shows that zero jobs were supported or no information is listed at all, according to the analysis,\u201d Jonathan O\u2019Connell, Emma Brown, Steven Rich and Aaron Gregg report. \u201cThe flaws raise questions about the claims by the Trump administration that 51 million jobs were \u2018supported\u2019 by the [PPP].\u201dThe federal stockpile is thinning out amid the case surge.\u201cThe federal government may not have the capacity to supply medical professionals with personal protective equipment amid the latest surge in coronavirus cases, according to internal administration documents,\u201d NBC News reports. \u201cFor example, the Strategic National Stockpile and the Federal Emergency Management Agency have fewer than 900,000 gloves in reserve after shipping 82.7 million of them \u2014 or just 30 percent of the amount requested by state, local and tribal governments \u2014 since the COVID-19 crisis began. \u2026 Nonetheless, Adm.

It went on and on.Support our journalism. Subscribe today.arrow-rightBut rather than rehash old ground, in this roundup we will focus on Trump\u2019s claims against his election rival, former vice president Joe Biden. Violating norms and protocol, the president used the august setting of the Rose Garden for a sustained campaign-style attack. Here are some of the more noteworthy claims he made. We don\u2019t award Pinocchios in roundups, but many of these statements are wildly off-course.\u201cBiden personally led the effort to give China permanent, most-favored nation status, which is a tremendous advantage for a country to have. Few countries have it. But the United States doesn\u2019t have it. Never did. Probably never even asked for it, because they didn\u2019t know what they were doing.\u201dADADFalse. \u201cMost favored\u201d trading status is one of those confusing inside-the-Beltway terms that apparently the president still does not understand. It just means normal trading relations. (As the World Trade Organization explains: \u201cIt suggests special treatment, but in the WTO it actually means non-discrimination \u2014 treating virtually everyone equally.\u201d)In the case of China, normal trade relations were suspended in 1951 after the communist takeover and then restored in 1980 on a rolling basis. Bill Clinton led the way for permanent resumption of normal trading status, not Joe Biden, and it was George W. Bush who established it in 2001.Contrary to Trump\u2019s statement, the United States has normal trading relations with just about every country in the world. The only exceptions are Cuba and North Korea.ADAD\u201cAmerica lost nearly 10,000 factories while Joe Biden was vice president. Think of that: 10,000 factories.\u201dBarack Obama took office in the midst of a recession, when hundreds of thousands of jobs a month were being shed, so be wary of numbers that record over an entire presidential term. (Similarly, the current recession has wiped away any gains earlier in Trump\u2019s term.) In Obama\u2019s second term, 10,000 factories were added. But we hesitate even to use the phrase.\u201cFactories\u201d may conjure up images of smokestacks and production lines, but the data set Trump cited is not really about factories. Trump is citing a Bureau of Labor Statistics database set known as the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages. More than 80 percent of these \u201cmanufacturing establishments\u201d employ five or fewer people, as the data includes such \u201cfactories\u201d as bakeries, candy stores and custom tailors.ADAD\u201cHe opposed my very strict travel ban on Chinese nationals to stop the spread of the China virus. He was totally against it. \u2018Xenophobic,\u2019 he called me. \u2018Xenophobic.\u2019 A month later, he admitted I was right.\u201dTrump is seizing on a comment Biden made the day Trump announced the travel restrictions. But whether Biden was specifically speaking about Trump\u2019s travel restrictions is open to debate.\u201cWe have, right now, a crisis with the coronavirus, from China,\u201d Biden said during an Iowa campaign appearance on Jan. 31. \u201cThis is no time for Donald Trump\u2019s record of hysteria and xenophobia \u2014 hysterical xenophobia \u2014 and fearmongering to lead the way instead of science.\u201d Biden went on to criticize Trump for proposing cuts in global health programs and for folding a White House pandemic office into another unit. But he did not specifically mention the travel restrictions on China.ADADThe restrictions were signaled shortly after noon on Jan. 31, after rumors that the Trump administration was considering halting flights. The travel restrictions were announced at 3:55 p.m. Biden took the stage about 15 minutes later.The Biden campaign says Biden was not referring to the travel restrictions and notes that the former vice president\u2019s remarks were similar to those in an opinion column he wrote that was published in USA Today four days earlier. \u201cI remember how Trump sought to stoke fear and stigma during the 2014 Ebola epidemic,\u201d Biden wrote on Jan. 27, such as advocating \u201creactionary travel bans.\u201d The comment included a link to a Trump tweet from 2014, urging Obama to \u201cclose down the flights from Ebola infected areas right now.\u201d (At the time, there were no direct flights from Ebola-affected areas to the United States.)\u201cIf we had listened to Joe Biden, hundreds of thousands of additional lives would have been lost.\u201dADADThere\u2019s no evidence Trump\u2019s restrictions on travel from China saved \u201chundreds of thousands\u201d of lives. The Trump administration imposed an entry ban on all foreign nationals who were in the People\u2019s Republic of China, excluding Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macao, in the previous 14 days, effective Feb. 2. But it included many exceptions. Moreover, many U.S. airlines already were canceling flights.The New York Times in early April estimated nearly 40,000 people had traveled from China to the United States in the two months after Trump imposed restrictions on such travel \u2014 and at least 430,000 people had arrived in the United States on direct flights from China since Dec. 31. While Trump often suggests the United States imposed the first ban, dozens of countries acted before the United States.The testing criteria set by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were extremely narrow: Only those with recent travel to China or those who had come into contact with a confirmed infection would be tested. Moreover, because the Trump administration bungled testing in February, allowing for few tests of Americans, it had little idea that the coronavirus was spreading silently through the country.ADAD\u201cIf you look at the job he did on swine flu \u2014 I looked at a poll \u2014 they have polls on everything nowadays \u2014 and he \u2014 they got very bad marks on the job they did on the swine flu, H1N1. He calls it 'N1H1\u2032 H1N1. He got very poor marks from Gallup on the job they did on swine flu. And they stopped, very early on, testing. They totally stopped it. They just said, \u2018Stop.\u2019\u201dUnder fire for a sluggish response, Trump has targeted the Obama administration\u2019s handling of the 2009 swine flu outbreak. But Obama\u2019s handling was widely praised at the time as the right mix of action and no overreaction.The estimated death toll in the United States during the H1N1 epidemic was 12,469 from April 2009 to April 2010, using an after-the-fact statistical analysis. That was much less than a forecast of 30,000 to 90,000 deaths made in August 2009 by the President\u2019s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology.ADADTrump claims Obama got \u201cvery poor marks from Gallup,\u201d but he would be gratified to get Obama\u2019s numbers. Two Gallup polls found 74 percent (May 2009) and 60 percent (August 2009) had confidence the government could handle the swine flu outbreak. By comparison, just 42 percent approve of Trump\u2019s handling of the coronavirus pandemic in the most recent Gallup poll.As for halting testing, this is strange Trump spin. The Obama administration decided that it would conserve government resources if it assumed flu cases with certain symptoms and risk factors could be deemed \u201cprobable\u201d H1N1 flu. So testing for the flu did not end, just extensive testing to identify this particular strain. Laboratory-confirmed deaths continued to be counted. (The decision did earn some criticism, as it turned out the number of probable cases was probably overestimated.)\u201cThe 2009 H1N1 strain was highly transmissible but did not induce more severe illness in adults or children than typical seasonal influenza viruses,\u201d said Tom Frieden, who was CDC director from 2009 to 2017. \u201cTherefore, most people who contracted the virus had no reason to seek diagnosis or care; for every laboratory confirmed case from April to October 2009, there were estimated to be 79 cases that did not seek testing. So it was never practical to identify cases, trace their contacts, and ask exposed people to quarantine. In July 2009, the CDC advised states it was no longer necessary to report the individual cases up for aggregation \u2014 but never \u2018stopped testing.\u2019 Collecting national data was no longer important because under those circumstances, the data were not a good measure of the scale of the epidemic, nor actionable for contact tracing.\u201dADADFrieden added: \u201cThe covid-19 pandemic is qualitatively different: the virus is highly transmissible and induces severe disease in many cases. Although not everyone who contracts the virus seeks and receives testing, a higher share do, so testing data is a more useful indicator of the direction of the epidemic.\u201d\u201cThese are actual key elements of the Biden-Sanders unity platform: Abolish immigration detention. No more detention. You come in here illegally, no more detention.\u201dNope. Remember: Biden surged in the Democratic primary running as a moderate alternative to more liberal candidates who proposed to decriminalize border crossings or abolish the agency in charge of deportations, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).The Biden campaign\u2019s immigration page says he would \u201cseek alternatives\u201d to migrant detention and work with nonprofits that help manage immigration cases for families awaiting hearings and released into the country. Under a legal settlement from 1997 known as the Flores agreement, U.S. immigration officials must release underage migrants in their custody within 20 days, usually to a relative or shelter. Biden\u2019s website says he would \u201cmove migrants into safe environments as quickly as possible\u201d and \u201cend for-profit detention centers.\u201dThe Biden-Sanders unity task force, which issued recommendations to Biden, not set-in-stone policies, similarly says \u201cdetention should be a last resort, not the default.\u201d\u201cDemocrats will prioritize investments in more effective and cost-efficient community-based alternatives to detention,\u201d the task force said. \u201cWe will end for-profit detention centers and ensure that any facility where migrants are being detained is held to the highest standards of care and guarantees the safety and dignity of families. Detention of children should be restricted to the shortest possible time, with their access to education and proper care ensured.\u201d\u201cStop all deportation. So if we get a MS-13 gang member, which we\u2019ve taken out of our country by the thousands \u2014 brought them back to Honduras, Guatemala \u2014 can\u2019t do that anymore \u2014 El Salvador. Can\u2019t do that anymore. Stop all deportations. So in other words, we\u2019ll take all of these people \u2014 many of whom are in prison for rape, murder, lots of other things.\u201dNeither Biden nor the unity task force has called for a full stop, though Biden has vowed a return to an Obama-era policy of prioritizing violent offenders and national security threats for deportation. Biden is also pledging a 100-day moratorium \u201con any deportations of people already in the United States.\u201dOn his campaign website, Biden says he would \u201crestore sensible enforcement priorities,\u201d \u201cdirect enforcement efforts toward threats to public safety and national security,\u201d end workplace immigration raids and \u201cprotect sensitive locations from immigration enforcement actions.\u201d\u201cNo one should be afraid to seek medical attention, go to school, their job, or their place of worship for fear of an immigration enforcement action,\u201d the Biden website says.The Biden-Sanders unity task force did not recommend a stop to deportations.The Trump campaign tweeted \u201cI\u2019m on Team Joe\u201d next to an image of shirtless, tattooed \u201cMS-13 gang members.\u201d But the reality is that Biden would make it easier than Trump to deport MS-13 gang members. The Obama-era policy was to put violent offenders such as gang members at the front of the deportation line. Trump took office and rolled back Obama\u2019s executive order, allowing immigration authorities to prioritize whatever they choose.\u201cExpand asylum for all new illegal aliens. How about that one? All new illegal aliens, expand asylum.\u201dIt\u2019s more accurate to say that the Trump administration has imposed a series of new restrictions on asylum claims and Biden would lift them.The Biden immigration page says he would reverse Trump\u2019s additional restrictions on asylum seekers traveling through Mexico or Guatemala, would not prosecute asylum seekers for \u201cmisdemeanor illegal entry,\u201d and would undo attempts \u201cto prevent victims of gang and domestic violence from receiving asylum,\u201d among other changes.The Trump administration pioneered a program known as \u201cRemain in Mexico,\u201d or the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP), under which mostly Central American migrants petitioning for asylum in the United States wait in Mexico while their U.S. immigration cases are pending. Democrats and migrant advocates say the arrangement exposes those asylum seekers to danger, which is not allowed under international laws covering refugees. Biden\u2019s website says he would end the MPP initiative \u201cand restore our asylum laws so that they do what they should be designed to do \u2014 protect people fleeing persecution and who cannot return home safely.\u201dBiden also pledges to increase the number of asylum officers, to process applications faster.\u201cMigrants who qualify for an asylum claim will be admitted to the country through an orderly process and connected with resources that will help them care for themselves,\u201d the Biden website says. \u201cMigrants who do not qualify will have the opportunity to make their claim before an immigration judge, but if they are unable to satisfy the court, the government will help facilitate their successful reintegration into their home countries.\u201dThe unity task force similarly says, \u201cDemocrats will end Trump Administration policies that deny protected entry to asylum seekers\u201d and adds, \u201cWe will end prosecution of asylum seekers at the border and policies that force them to apply from \u2018safe third countries,\u2019 which are far from safe.\u201d\u201cHis son [Hunter Biden] walked out with $1.5 billion of money to invest, where he\u2019ll make hundreds of thousands of dollars \u2014 maybe millions of dollars a year. Walked out with $1.5 billion. I asked one of the biggest people on Wall Street \u2014 maybe the biggest \u2014 \u2018Is that possible?\u2019 He said, \u2018No.' He\u2019s never seen it. They don\u2019t do that.\u201dTrump\u2019s Wall Street friend may be onto something \u2014 because there is no evidence to support these statements.In December 2013, Hunter Biden and one of his daughters flew from Japan to China with Joe Biden on Air Force Two as the vice president embarked on a diplomatic mission. Twelve days after he flew to Beijing, Hunter Biden joined an advisory board of a fund called BHR Partners, which had announced it would try to raise $1.5 billion. While Joe Biden was vice president, Hunter Biden was only on the board of the advisory firm that did not directly invest, but instead advised those who did.George Mesires, a lawyer for Hunter Biden, said the younger Biden only took an equity stake in 2017, after Joe Biden was no longer vice president. Mesires told The Fact Checker that the investment management company \u201cwas capitalized from various sources with a total of 30 million RMB [Chinese renminbi], or about $4.2 million, not $1.5 billion.\u201d Because Biden acquired a 10 percent minority interest, his \u201ccapital commitment is approximately $420,000,\u201d Mesires said. \u201cTo date, Mr. Biden has not received any return or compensation on account of this investment or his position on the board of directors,\u201d Mesires added. Hunter Biden announced he would resign from the board of the company on Oct. 31, 2019.\u201cAs Vice President, Biden was a leading advocate of the Paris climate accord, which was unbelievably expensive to our country. It would\u2019ve crushed American manufacturers while allowing China to pollute \u2014 pollute the atmosphere with impunity.\u201dEach country set its own commitments under the Paris accord. So Trump could have unilaterally changed the commitments offered by Obama, which is technically allowed under the agreement.Moreover, China, in its Paris accord commitment, said that, compared with 2005 levels, it would seek to cut its carbon emissions by 60 to 65 percent per unit of gross domestic product by 2030. China pledged to reach these goals by 2030. The Climate Action Tracker says Beijing has policies in place to meet and even overachieve its Paris accord targets, even if it remains insufficient to halt global warming of temperatures.\u201cAbolish \u2014 in the suburbs, you\u2019re going to abolish the suburbs with this. Enforce Obama-Biden\u2019s radical AFFH \u2014 that\u2019s the AFFH regulation that threatens to strip localities of federal affordable housing funds unless they change their zoning laws to fit the federal government\u2019s demands. So what you have \u2014 I mean, I\u2019ve been watching this for years in Westchester, coming from New York. They want low-income housing built in a neighborhood. Well, I\u2019m ending that rule. I\u2019m taking it out, so \u2014 I spoke with Ben Carson the other day. We\u2019re going to be taking it out. I\u2019ve watched that whole thing go, and now they want to make it twice as bad in the suburbs \u2014 in the suburbs. Mothers aren\u2019t happy about that. Fathers aren\u2019t happy about that. They worked hard to buy a house, and now they\u2019re going to watch the housing values drop like a rock, and that has happened. It dropped like a rock. So we\u2019re not going to do that; we\u2019re going to do the exact opposite.\u201dThe Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing rule (AFFH) does not aim to bulldoze the suburbs. Rather, the rule is the latest attempt to push the Department of Housing and Urban Development to do more to enforce and implement a section of the Fair Housing Act of 1968 requiring the government to \u201caffirmatively further fair housing.\u201dThe rule, which was finalized in July 2015 and has been in limbo since Obama left office, is designed to push \u201cmeaningful actions, in addition to combating discrimination, that overcome patterns of segregation and foster inclusive communities free from barriers that restrict access to opportunity based on protected characteristics.\u201d Put simply, it was designed to help state and local officials provide better access to opportunity, following the original 1968 guideline.For evidence of the bleak future, Trump points to his own experience \u201cwatching this for years.\u201d But he goes on to bungle the facts, suggesting that following the AFFH would lead to \u201chousing values [dropping] like a rock.\u201d Most research suggests that the proximity of affordable housing does not depress property values.The president ought to be familiar with fair housing rules. The government charged Trump, along with his father and their company, with violating the Fair Housing Act in 1973 for not renting to blacks. The Trumps eventually signed a consent decree in 1975, which they were accused of violating just three years later.(About our rating scale)Send us facts to check by filling out this formSign up for The Fact Checker weekly newsletterThe Fact Checker is a verified signatory to the International Fact-Checking Network code of principles", "comment": "133 Comments", "topic": "Fact Checker"}, {"cover": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ILDXXJGQG4I6VATLZQ4U3ASOGU.jpghttps://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ILDXXJGQG4I6VATLZQ4U3ASOGU.jpg", "title": "How 2020 Pressed Fast Forward on the Streaming Wars", "date": "Jul 27, 2020", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/how-2020-pressed-fast-forward-on-the-streaming-wars/2020/07/27/4437f810-d037-11ea-826b-cc394d824e35_story.html", "keyword": "China and the world order", "website": "the Washington Post", "author": "", "content": "As 2020 began, media giants were aggressively buying and stockpiling content for new online video services in the multibillion-dollar competition known as the streaming wars. Then the new coronavirus hit, cinemas closed, Hollywood temporarily shut down and everyone grabbed a remote, finding comfort or mere distraction in the entertainment offerings that unspool in a continuous flow of data over high-speed connections. A year already destined to be volatile for the industry suddenly hit fast forward on the future.Support our journalism. Subscribe today.arrow-right1. How many companies are competing?Four of the most valuable companies in the S&P 500 launched streaming services just in time to divert and entertain locked-down Americans: Disney+, Apple TV+, Peacock from Comcast Corp. and HBO Max from AT&T Inc. They joined established players Netflix, Amazon Prime Video and Hulu. Quibi, a startup offering original short-form programming, also entered the market in April, and ViacomCBS Inc. plans a makeover for its CBS All Access service. Netflix, with 183 million subscribers globally, remains the one to beat. Rivals hope that by nabbing the rights to binge- worthy programs, such as \u201cFriends\u201d and \u201cThe Office,\u201d and plowing money into new exclusive content, they\u2019ll quickly catch up.ADAD2. Is there room for that many players?Surveys find the average customer will pay for three to five streaming services at a time. (Basic plans generally cost $5 to $12 a month.) Since canceling is easy, subscribers may alternate between services, going wherever new content is added. Consumers\u2019 desire to save money has given rise to free, advertising-supported apps such as Pluto TV, owned by ViacomCBS, and Roku Inc.\u2019s Roku Channel. The industry is also competing with user-generated video content found on platforms such as Instagram, TikTok and YouTube, the most popular online video service in the world.3. What about other kinds of streaming entertainment?ADThose areas are also getting crowded. In cloud gaming, there\u2019s PlayStation Now, Microsoft Corp.\u2019s Game Pass for Xbox users and Stadia by Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google, among others. Twitch, the leading site for watching games being livestreamed by others, has competitors, including Facebook Gaming and YouTube Gaming. In the world of podcasts, Spotify Technology SA has emerged as the single biggest spender, investing hundreds of millions of dollars to acquire companies such as The Ringer and Gimlet Media Inc. and potentially steal advertising dollars from radio. Competition will lead to walls and silos: Comedian Joe Rogan announced that his popular program would soon be available only to Spotify subscribers, and many other exclusive deals will follow.AD4. Is the same thing happening in the rest of the world?Yes, and that competition involves some of the same companies. Netflix\u2019s count of nearly 60 million subscribers across Europe, the Middle East and Africa isn\u2019t far behind the 70 million it has in the U.S. and Canada; it\u2019s also growing in Asia and Latin America. Disney+ has arrived in many of those same markets, and the company owns India\u2019s Hotstar, which offers cricket and Bollywood films. In China, Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Baidu Inc. have streaming services called Youku and iQiyi, while European media companies have been joining forces to create their own Netflix rivals, such as BritBox, a joint venture of U.K. broadcasters BBC and ITV.AD5. How did the pandemic change things?Stay-at-home orders boosted video consumption across the board and the use of streaming services in particular. Netflix signed up more than twice as many users in the first quarter as it expected, and its serendipitously timed \u201cTiger King\u201d documentary series went viral. A browser extension called Netflix Party let friends watch shows and chat together virtually. YouTube saw a spike in music video consumption, platforms such as Twitch and Instagram offered free live concerts, and musicians sold tickets to at-home performances on Stageit. The gradual loosening of quarantines moderated some of those shifts.AD6. So are streaming companies sitting pretty?ADActually, they have some big obstacles on the horizon. Netflix\u2019s U.S. expansion was slowing before the pandemic, and it warned that its massive first-quarter growth may mean a slower pace for the remainder of the year. All the streaming services rely on fresh programming to draw in customers, but lockdowns meant none of them were able to produce new TV shows or movies for months.7. Who loses?Cable-TV operators continue to hemorrhage subscribers, but those that also provide broadband to homes, including Comcast and Charter Communications Inc., benefit from a surge in new customers who want to stream. Movie theaters were already suffering declines in ticket sales and must now contend with the public\u2019s fear of large gatherings \u2014 which might undermine live concerts and theater in the long term, too. Cinephiles lament the diminution of the big-screen experience. Director Martin Scorsese, for one, pleaded with Netflix viewers to watch \u201cThe Irishman\u201d on a proper television or at least \u201ca big iPad,\u201d not on a tiny smartphone screen. That didn\u2019t stop him from selling his latest movie to Apple.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P.", "comment": "0 Comments", "topic": "Business"}, {"cover": "", "title": "Kodak lands loan to bolster US-produced drug supply", "date": "Jul 28, 2020", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/kodak/2020/07/28/1636a4a4-d0ee-11ea-826b-cc394d824e35_story.html", "keyword": "China and the world order", "website": "the Washington Post", "author": "", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Eastman Kodak will receive a federal loan of $765 million to help reduce reliance on other countries for ingredients in generic drugs, an agreement President Donald Trump hailed Tuesday as a breakthrough in bringing more pharmaceutical manufacturing to the United States.Support our journalism.

His administration had telegraphed the move for weeks. On May 27, Secretary of State Michael Pompeo notified Congress that the White House no longer regarded Hong Kong as autonomous from mainland China. On June 29, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said that meant the special status had been revoked.ADAD2. What\u2019s the impact?In the short term, the White House said that holders of Hong Kong passports will lose some special privileges -- until now, they\u2019ve been exempt from certain requirements on mainland Chinese who travel to the U.S. He also said Hong Kong will lose some benefits related to U.S. exports. But Trump offered no specifics about the broader impact of his order, including what it means for tariffs and for Hong Kong\u2019s financial industry. Earlier, Pompeo had announced visa restrictions against unspecified Chinese officials and said the U.S. would cease selling defense equipment to Hong Kong, a largely symbolic act that will mostly affect the city\u2019s police and corrections forces. In deciding how far to go, Trump has to weigh consequences for the U.S. economy, including the U.S.-China trade deal that Trump had considered one of his biggest achievements and which could affect his odds of winning re-election.3. What\u2019s at stake for Hong Kong and China?ADADWhile Hong Kong remains a gateway from China to the rest of the world, it matters far less to the mainland\u2019s fortunes than it once did. In 2019, 12% of China\u2019s exports went to or through Hong Kong, down from 45% in 1992. China is also far less reliant on inflows of foreign capital and expertise, and made a lower priority of making the yuan an international currency -- although it has renewed the push as tensions with the U.S. have risen. Regardless, the city still matters. Hong Kong\u2019s open capital account and adherence to international standards of governance are unmatched by any mainland Chinese city and make it an important base for international banks and trading firms. A revocation of its special status would mark \u201cthe beginning of the death of Hong Kong as we know it,\u201d Steve Tsang, director of the University of London\u2019s SOAS China Institute, said last year.4. And their financial markets?If the U.S. treats Hong Kong no differently than any other Chinese city, would ratings firms and investors do the same? That\u2019s a question posed by Deutsche Bank, which noted that S&P Global Ratings has Hong Kong three notches above China while Moody\u2019s and Fitch have Hong Kong one notch higher. The risk is that China\u2019s own rating gets lowered in coming years and drags Hong Kong\u2019s down with it. At the same time, equity index providers may take a fresh look at Hong Kong, which is currently in the MSCI World Index with other developed markets. China is in the emerging market index, raising the question, should Hong Kong be treated the same as Shanghai and Shenzhen?ADAD5. What\u2019s at stake for the U.S.?It has its own reasons for not rocking the boat too much. Hong Kong, the only semi-democratic jurisdiction under Chinese rule, offers U.S. companies a relatively safe way to access the Chinese market and employs a U.S. dollar peg, linking it with the American financial system. According to the Congressional Research Service, the largest U.S. trade surplus in 2019 was with Hong Kong \u2014 $36 billion. Hong Kong counted 278 U.S. companies with regional headquarters in the city that year and another 457 with offices. Hong Kong\u2019s first justice minister after the handover to China in 1997, Elsie Leung, told the South China Morning Post in May that any damage would be mutual: \u201cWe are not just getting the benefits \u2013 it\u2019s a free-trade arrangement which is good for both sides.\u201d6. How has China responded?ADADThe Foreign Ministry has promised unspecified retaliation against what it terms foreign interference, insisting Hong Kong is purely an internal affair. China said last year it would sanction some U.S.-based activist groups including the National Endowment for Democracy, Human Rights Watch and Freedom House, and suspend port visits by U.S. Navy ships to Hong Kong. The official Xinhua News Agency has dismissed as \u201cgroundless\u201d accusations about the loss of freedom or human rights issues in Hong Kong. It also noted that the 2018 Human Freedom Index compiled by the Fraser Institute, a Vancouver-based think tank, ranked Hong Kong at No. 3, well ahead of the U.S. at No. 17.7. And Hong Kong?The city\u2019s leader, Chief Executive Carrie Lam, has said it\u2019s \u201ctotally unacceptable\u201d for foreign legislatures to interfere in Hong Kong\u2019s internal affairs, and that sanctions would only complicate the city\u2019s problems. (Lam was selected in 2017 by a committee of 1,200 political insiders overwhelmingly loyal to the Chinese government.) She has sought to reassure investors that the city still adheres to the rule of law and has an independent judiciary. She also has defended police actions.ADAD8. Is this what the pro-democracy protesters have been seeking?As a largely leaderless movement, the Hong Kong protests have made no official request for international assistance. But some prominent activists including Jimmy Lai and Joshua Wong called on Trump to hit China hard with sanctions. Wong had testified last year in Washington in favor of putting pressure on China. On the streets of Hong Kong, some protesters have made clear their interest in U.S. support by waving American flags, singing \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner\u201d and calling on Trump to \u201cliberate\u201d Hong Kong. Such rallying cries are now illegal in Hong Kong under the new national security law.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P.", "comment": "0 Comments", "topic": "Business"}, {"cover": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/BB6V2JGOF4I6VGNQQQTOE3JAHM.jpghttps://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/BB6V2JGOF4I6VGNQQQTOE3JAHM.jpg", "title": "U.S. coronavirus deaths top 1,000 for four consecutive days", "date": "Jul 25, 2020", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/07/25/coronavirus-covid-updates/", "keyword": "China and the world order", "website": "the Washington Post", "author": "David J.

U.S. hospitals treated 59,670 people on Friday, just shy of the mid-April record of 59,940, according to the Covid Tracking Project.ADADAt least 143,000 Americans have died of covid-19 and more than 4.1 million have been infected, according to data tracked by The Washington Post. As of Saturday evening, the seven-day averages for new cases hit fresh highs in Hawaii, Puerto Rico, Kentucky, Alaska, Mississippi, Missouri, Indiana, Kansas and California, according to The Post\u2019s tracking.Stay safe and informed with our free Coronavirus Updates newsletterMontana\u2019s one-day case high increased by more than half from its previous high \u2014 from 144 cases on July 15 to 221 on Saturday. Hawaii\u2019s single-day infections count also set a record.California, South Carolina, Georgia, Texas and Florida set records for their seven-day averages of daily deaths.The galloping outbreak appears to have bested efforts to return the economy to normal functioning, at least for now. After regaining almost one-third of the nearly 21 million jobs lost when most nonessential businesses closed this spring, the U.S. economy appears to be losing momentum.ADADWorkplace activity has slumped in the hardest-hit states and is plateauing elsewhere, leaving the number of Americans working \u201croughly unchanged\u201d over the past month, the bank said.A new Census Bureau survey of U.S. households was even more downbeat. It found 5 million fewer Americans saying they were employed than in a similar survey two weeks earlier.The economy is set to suffer a further blow within days as funding for enhanced unemployment benefits and a federal moratorium on evictions both expire. The Senate recessed for the weekend, with Republicans unable to unite behind an alternative to House Democrats\u2019 proposed $3 trillion economic rescue legislation.ADLawmakers had spoken of reaching a deal before the end of the month, when millions of jobless Americans will see their additional $600-per-week benefits vanish. But Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said Friday he hoped for a compromise, including funding for schools and health programs, \u201cin the next few weeks.\u201dADAny measure is likely to be the last legislative remedy for the pandemic-inspired recession before the November election.Notes of caution were also sounded on the medical front. Anthony S. Fauci, the nation\u2019s top infectious-disease expert, said states hit hard by the virus in recent weeks need to halt or reverse their reopenings while they grapple with infection surges. During a live interview with The Post, Fauci said a coronavirus vaccine would probably not be \u201cwidely available\u201d until \u201cseveral months in\u201d to 2021.ADThe Food and Drug Administration is warning consumers that at least 77 hand-sanitizer products may contain methanol, a toxic compound that can cause blindness or even death.Houston, Miami, other cities face mounting health care worker shortages as infections climbIn states where cases have ballooned, officials are weighing additional public health measures to slow the spread of the virus, even as they battle resistance from some quarters.ADCiting a recent rise in infections, New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell (D) banned the sale of takeout alcoholic drinks at bars and restaurants, effective Saturday. The mayor\u2019s announcement at a news conference Friday came after Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards (D) ordered the state\u2019s bars closed for on-premise consumption earlier this month.ADIn Washington state, a federal judged rejected a legal challenge to Gov. Jay Inslee\u2019s coronavirus edicts. While Republican state lawmakers argued for a preliminary injunction against the Democratic chief executive\u2019s use of emergency powers, which they called unconstitutional, U.S. District Judge Benjamin Settle ruled that other state officials, not Inslee (D), were responsible for enforcing the orders.California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) said state nursing-home inspectors would start being tested for the coronavirus regularly. The change, announced Friday, comes on the heels of a Los Angeles Times report revealing that inspectors were not tested before they entered the facilities and could have been bringing the virus to vulnerable residents.ADOther states moved toward loosening restrictions, even as the virus raged there. The secretary of Florida\u2019s Department of Business and Professional Regulation, Halsey Beshears, signaled that he planned to start talking with bars and breweries about how they can return to business. His announcement came as Florida\u2019s average number of deaths rose for the third straight day.ADIn Texas, bar owners themselves were fighting for the ability to reopen. Nearly 800 owners there said they would participate in \u201cFreedom Fest\u201d on Saturday, and openly defy a June 26 order by Gov. Greg Abbott (R) to shut down, the Fort Worth Star-Telegram reported.Even as the pandemic rages, an information battle to define it continues.A conservative television network on Saturday canceled a planned program advancing a baseless conspiracy theory that Fauci was responsible for the creation of the coronavirus. The allegation originated with the former medical researcher behind the debunked \u201cPlandemic\u201d documentary.ADAmid fierce criticism, Sinclair Broadcast Group on Saturday said it had decided to postpone the program to bring together \u201cother viewpoints and provide additional context.\u201dADThe \u201cAmerica This Week\u201d program would have featured host Eric Bolling interviewing former researcher Judy Mikovits, who claims that Fauci \u201cmanufactured\u201d the coronavirus and shipped it to Wuhan, China, where the outbreak began. A chyron during the segment reads: \u201cDID DR. FAUCI CREATE covid-19?\u201dThe segment was first reported on by Media Matters, a liberal media watchdog.In a statement on its Twitter account, Sinclair, which has 191 stations, insisted it was not \u201caligning with or endorsing\u201d Mikovits\u2019s views and said it supported Fauci \u201cvaliantly.\u201dBolling later told The Post that \u201cthis segment does need to be reworked to provide better context, and as such we are delaying the airing of the episode for one week.\u201dADAD\u201cLet me also add that I have immense respect for Dr. Fauci and recognize him as the leading expert on this topic,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cFor the past two months, I have consistently pursued the opportunity to bring Dr. Fauci on air so that he may provide critical information to the public about the virus. The invitation stands.\u201dA Sinclair spokesperson and Mikovits did not immediately respond to The Post\u2019s requests for comment.Also Saturday, Hurricane Hanna, the first hurricane of the 2020 Atlantic season, threatened to complicate efforts to social distance as coastal communities in Texas prepared to shelter in place. Hidalgo County Judge Richard F. Cortez told residents to bring soap and hand sanitizer with them if they are forced to evacuate their homes.Although the United States has logged more cases of the virus than any other country, the pandemic continued to make waves around the world this weekend.ADNorth Korean leader Kim Jong Un imposed a lockdown on the city of Kaesong and declared a state of emergency after someone there was found to have symptoms of the coronavirus, the Associated Press reported, citing North Korea\u2019s state-run media.

And their financial markets?If the U.S. treats Hong Kong no differently than any other Chinese city, would ratings firms and investors do the same? That\u2019s a question posed by Deutsche Bank, which noted that S&P Global Ratings has Hong Kong three notches above China while Moody\u2019s and Fitch have Hong Kong one notch higher. The risk is that China\u2019s own rating gets lowered in coming years and drags Hong Kong\u2019s down with it. At the same time, equity index providers may take a fresh look at Hong Kong, which is currently in the MSCI World Index with other developed markets. China is in the emerging market index, raising the question, should Hong Kong be treated the same as Shanghai and Shenzhen?ADAD5. What\u2019s at stake for the U.S.?It has its own reasons for not rocking the boat too much. Hong Kong, the only semi-democratic jurisdiction under Chinese rule, offers U.S. companies a relatively safe way to access the Chinese market and employs a U.S. dollar peg, linking it with the American financial system. According to the Congressional Research Service, the largest U.S. trade surplus in 2019 was with Hong Kong \u2014 $36 billion. Hong Kong counted 278 U.S. companies with regional headquarters in the city that year and another 457 with offices. Hong Kong\u2019s first justice minister after the handover to China in 1997, Elsie Leung, told the South China Morning Post in May that any damage would be mutual: \u201cWe are not just getting the benefits \u2013 it\u2019s a free-trade arrangement which is good for both sides.\u201d6. How has China responded?ADADThe Foreign Ministry has promised unspecified retaliation against what it terms foreign interference, insisting Hong Kong is purely an internal affair. China said last year it would sanction some U.S.-based activist groups including the National Endowment for Democracy, Human Rights Watch and Freedom House, and suspend port visits by U.S. Navy ships to Hong Kong. The official Xinhua News Agency has dismissed as \u201cgroundless\u201d accusations about the loss of freedom or human rights issues in Hong Kong. It also noted that the 2018 Human Freedom Index compiled by the Fraser Institute, a Vancouver-based think tank, ranked Hong Kong at No. 3, well ahead of the U.S. at No. 17.7. And Hong Kong?The city\u2019s leader, Chief Executive Carrie Lam, has said it\u2019s \u201ctotally unacceptable\u201d for foreign legislatures to interfere in Hong Kong\u2019s internal affairs, and that sanctions would only complicate the city\u2019s problems. (Lam was selected in 2017 by a committee of 1,200 political insiders overwhelmingly loyal to the Chinese government.) She has sought to reassure investors that the city still adheres to the rule of law and has an independent judiciary. She also has defended police actions.ADAD8. Is this what the pro-democracy protesters have been seeking?As a largely leaderless movement, the Hong Kong protests have made no official request for international assistance. But some prominent activists including Jimmy Lai and Joshua Wong called on Trump to hit China hard with sanctions. Wong had testified last year in Washington in favor of putting pressure on China. On the streets of Hong Kong, some protesters have made clear their interest in U.S. support by waving American flags, singing \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner\u201d and calling on Trump to \u201cliberate\u201d Hong Kong. Such rallying cries are now illegal in Hong Kong under the new national security law.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P.", "comment": "1 Comments", "topic": "Business"}, {"cover": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/V6Y2ETGLTUI6VGNQQQTOE3JAHM.jpghttps://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/V6Y2ETGLTUI6VGNQQQTOE3JAHM.jpg", "title": "Power Up: No sign of election money in GOP coronavirus relief plan as states scramble before November", "date": "Jul 24, 2020", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/07/24/power-up-no-sign-election-money-gop-coronavirus-bill-states-scramble-before-november/", "keyword": "China and the world order", "website": "the Washington Post", "author": "Jacqueline Alemany", "content": "with Brent D.

But there's so far little sign from Washington on whether they'll get the extra money they're seeking to help fund this.\u00a0ADThe White House and Senate Republicans failed to reach an agreement on a coronavirus relief package on Thursday, with the expiration of enhanced unemployment benefits looming just days away. The payroll tax cut that Trump had previously demanded was finally jettisoned but disagreements over the package's size and scope and its other provisions frustrated GOP efforts to move forward.\u00a0ADSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell outlined the broad terms of the bill \u2014 saying it would include another round of stimulus checks, aid for schools, money for coronavirus testing, changes to unemployment assistance rules, additional money for small businesses, and liability reform \u2014 but made no mention of additional funding for elections that Democrats, experts, state and local officials insist is necessary.\u00a0\u201cRepublicans had hoped to present a unified GOP plan July 22, but factions within the GOP couldn\u2019t reach an agreement and now they are hoping to have a united offer to Democrats on Monday. Late Thursday, they were still fighting over whether to include a demand by Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) related to manufacturing and China,\u201d our colleagues Erica Werner, Seung Min Kim and Jeff Stein report.\u00a0While House Democrats included $3.6 billion for elections as part of the $3 trillion coronavirus stimulus package they passed in May, Senate staffers told Power Up that many Republicans are disinclined to grant additional money for elections:\u00a0AD\u201cNo such thing as free money, as they say,\u201d a Republican Senate staffer told us. \u201cThe second the federal government starts giving money to states for 'security' then the next thing you know they\u2019ll condition that money on states doing what they want, be in universal mail in or whatever.\u201d\u00a0\u201cI think the biggest fights will be around state/local funding, [unemployment insurance] benefits, schools, and testing,\u201d a Senate Democratic staffer said. \u201cI know Dems obviously want additional money in [election] security and it was included in [the House Democratic bill] but not sure it will end up in there.\u201dExtra money, however, could go a long way in helping election officials manage an expansion of mail-in voting and other last-minute changes due to the pandemic.\u00a0As of now, nearly 180 million Americans who are eligible to vote would be able to cast a ballot by mail in the fall \u2014 or 76 percent of Americans, according to an analysis by our colleagues Kate Rabinowitz\u00a0and Brittany Renee Mayes.\u00a0But the effort carries a hefty price tag. \u201cEven in states that haven\u2019t made absentee voting easier, the number of ballot requests is still expected to spike. To meet this challenge, local election officials will have to overcome numerous hurdles with little time and money to spare,\u201d our colleagues write. \u201cThey must acquire large volumes of specialized envelopes and paper. Additional staff, and in some cases machines, are necessary to open, sort and tabulate postal ballots and verify signatures. This staff needs to be trained, and voters need to be educated on the process.\u201d\u00a0ADAD\u201cThese unexpected expenditures come as the coronavirus pandemic has pummeled local budgets and hit a corner of government \u2014 election administration \u2014 that\u2019s been underfunded for decades,\u201d per Kate and Brittany.\u00a0\u201cThey operate without the staff they need in the normal or they don\u2019t have enough equipment in the normal,\u201d Amber McReynolds, chief executive of Vote at Home, a nonpartisan nonprofit advocating for and advising on how to conduct elections by mail, told them. \u201cNone of this is a new problem, but it\u2019s exacerbated in a pandemic.\u201dThere's also an expected surge in overall expenses due to the pandemic, including for protective equipment (and potentially hazard pay) for poll workers, along with cleaning products and hand sanitizer for those who choose to vote in person.The Brennan Center for Justice at New York University estimated the total cost of these upgrades\u00a0would be $4 billion \u2013 which aligns with the latest Democratic proposal when added with the $400 million lawmakers from both parties passed during an earlier coronavirus relief bill in March.\u00a0But Republicans aren't united: Senate Rules and Administration Committee Chairman Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) acknowledged the circumstances might require additional election assistance. \u201cState and local election officials face a unique set of challenges with the covid-19 pandemic,\u201d Blunt said during a hearing on Tuesday. \u201cWe need to be sure they have the resources and, importantly, the flexibility to address those challenges in ways that best fit their needs.\"\u00a0Even if enough lawmakers coalesce around the idea of more election money, the next huge battle would be over mandates. House Democrats' bill \u201ccomes as close to a federal takeover of elections as has yet been proposed,\u201d coupling the influx of election money with new mandates for state and local election officials that will last long after the pandemic ends, our colleague Joe Marks notes.\u00a0\u201cIt mandates that states offer voting-by-mail options for all voters without excuses for all future elections starting in November. It also mandates 15 days of early voting across the country. And it requires that states draw up detailed plans to hold elections during future emergencies that the federal government can challenge in court if they don\u2019t sufficiently protect voters and poll workers.\u201d\u00a0\u201cIt even digs into the nitty-gritty of how states must run elections during the pandemic and other emergencies, including mandating they mail ballots directly to every registered voter.\u201dHouse Republicans tore into the provisions that they said override state constitutions, disenfranchise voters and will lead to increased voter fraud \u2014 and mandates are almost certain to get a similarly cool reception in the GOP-controlled Senate. The previous $400 million had no strings attached.\u00a0And President Trump has repeatedly and falsely attacked voting by mail, which could complicate negotiations in the Senate further. It's a strategy that worries some Republicans it might end up undermining their own party's candidates.\u00a0ADADFrom GOP pollster Glen Bolger:\u00a0 \n  \n  \n  You are reading the Power Up newsletter. \n  Not a regular subscriber? \n   \n   \n    \n   \n   \n  \n \nThe PeopleU.S. TOPS 4 MILLION CORONAVIRUS CASES: \u201cThe rapid spread of the virus this summer is striking, taking just 15 days to go from 3 million confirmed cases to 4 million. By comparison, the increase from 1 million cases to 2 million spanned 45 days from April 28 to June 11, and the leap to 3 million then took 27 days,\u201d Anne Gearan, Marisa Iati and Jacqueline Dupree report of the grim milestone.The CampaignTRUMP CANCELS JACKSONVILLE PORTION OF GOP CONVENTION: \u201cTrump abruptly canceled the Republican National Convention celebrations scheduled for next month in Jacksonville, Fla., making the latest in a series of head-snapping reversals in the face of a nationwide pandemic that continues to spread out of control,\u201d Michael Scherer, Josh Dawsey and Colby Itkowitz report.ADThe president had been searching for a place to host a loud boisterous crowd: \u201cThe president\u2019s ambition, however, ran headlong into a massive spike in coronavirus cases in Florida, growing local opposition and enormous logistical hurdles. At one point, convention planners announced they would administer daily coronavirus tests to thousands of delegates, donors and members of the media to help reduce the viral risk. That plan was later scrapped to move large portions of the celebrations to an outdoor venue.\u201dBehind the reversal: \u201cRepublican planners had already concluded that a packed, indoor arena would not be possible over several consecutive nights, given the high caseload in northern Florida,\u201d our colleagues write. \u201cSome White House and campaign officials were fearful of the negative press if delegates and others were infected with the virus at the convention \u2026\"ADThe National Guard may have been needed: \u201cThey also came to the conclusion that they would probably have to use the National Guard to protect the convention from protests and allow for distancing in the crowd. The president, advisers said, was less than enthusiastic about an arena or stadium that appeared less than full.\u201dOutside the Beltway\u2018OPERATION LEGEND\u2019 VIEWED AS POLITICAL CRACKDOWN: \u201cFederal agents began descending in earnest on Kansas City, Mo., this week as part of an operation that will have them working with local detectives to interview suspects and witnesses and sift through evidence in an effort to quell violent crime, U.S. officials said,\u201d Matt Zapotosky and Annie Gowen report. \u201cThe operation, in any other administration, might have been largely seen as inoffensive for a city that has experienced a massive spike in homicides from the prior year. But the timing \u2014 just after federal officers in military garb violently cracked down on racial justice demonstrators in Portland, Ore., and [Trump] threatened to dispatch U.S. law enforcement to other cities \u2014 could hardly be worse.\u201d\u00a0ADLocals are suspicious: \u201cSome officials said they were not consulted and do not know the precise plans. After the Trump administration announced Wednesday it would increase the federal presence in Chicago and Albuquerque, local officials there greeted the news icily,\u201d our colleagues write. Over 200 agents from the FBI, Drug Enforcement Administration, U.S. Marshals Service and other federal agencies are being sent to Missouri.Agents' conduct in Portland and in D.C. is now being investigated: \u201cTwo federal inspectors general announced they will investigate how Justice Department and Homeland Security agents used force, detained people and conducted themselves at high-profile clashes,\u201d Devlin Barrett reports.ADThe IG inquiries add to a growing list of inquiries into events in those cities: \u201cThe Democratic leaders of three congressional panels \u2014 Reps. Jerrold Nadler (N.Y.) of the Judiciary Committee, Carolyn B. Maloney (N.Y) of the Oversight and Reform Committee and Bennie Thompson (Miss.) of the Homeland Security Committee \u2014 said in a joint statement that the investigations are \u2018critically important\u2019 because the Trump administration has pledged to send federal agents to more cities in the coming days.\u201dIt is important to remember that most IG investigations take time and sometimes don't result in a public report for more than a year.On The HillLEWIS TO LIE IN STATE: \u201cThe late representative John Lewis will lie in state at the U.S. Capitol next week as congressional leaders take extraordinary steps amid the pandemic to honor the civil rights leader and allow the general public to pay their respects,\u201d Colby Itkowitz reports.While the Capitol remains closed to the public, people will be able to pay their respects: \u201cOnly a smaller, invitation-only group will be allowed inside the building on Monday afternoon for a ceremony under the Capitol Rotunda. Lewis\u2019s casket will then be moved to the top of the steps at the East Front of the Capitol for public viewing,\u201d our colleague writes.Another DMV-area tribute: \u201cFairfax County Public Schools is renaming Robert E. Lee High School in Northern Virginia for [Lewis], a historic switch that follows a wave of similar rechristenings throughout the South,\u201d Hannah Natanson reports.The civil rights icon will also lead one final march from Selma: \u201cAt 10 a.m. Sunday, his body will be carried on a lone pilgrimage across Edmund Pettus Bridge and on to Alabama\u2019s Capitol, where he will\u00a0lie in state at the Capitol from 2 to 7 p.m. Sunday,\u201d the Montgomery Advertiser's Brad Harper reports.In the MediaWHAT ELSE YOU NEED TO KNOW:ADAOC slams GOP congressman's explanation of their confrontation: \u201cSurrounded by Democratic colleagues, Rep. Alexandria \u00adOcasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), a favorite target of Trump and other Republicans since her arrival in the Capitol, excoriated Rep. Ted Yoho (R-Fla.) during remarks on the House floor. She dismissed what she called a non-apology for a confrontation between them on the Capitol steps this week and decried Yoho\u2019s reported use of a sexist slur as part of a pattern of inexcusable behavior by men,\u201d John Wagner and Paul Kane report.ADBaseball is back \u2026 kind of: \u201cIt was a miracle there was baseball at all Thursday night at Nationals Park \u2014 or on any night this summer anywhere in the United States, a country in the grips of a once-in-a-century pandemic,\u201d Dave Sheinin reports. The defending world champs couldn't keep the Brox bombers at bay falling 1-4 \u00a0in a rain-delay shortened start to the abbreviated 60-game season.Players on both the Nationals and Yankees knelt before the national anthem holding a black cloth: \u201cA few seconds later, each member of the Nationals and Yankees stood for the national anthem. No player took a knee, ending speculation that players might choose to do so as the country\u2019s racial reckoning continues. Instead, they demonstrated in other ways,\u201d Roman Stubbs reports. \u201cSome wore \u2018Black Lives Matter\u2019 T-shirts during pregame warmups, and many had the slogan affixed to a small patch on their game uniforms.\u201dD.C. will keep on waiting for new football team name: \u201cFans divided by Washington\u2019s NFL team retiring its old nickname were reunited when the club announced it would play this season as the \u2018Washington Football Team.\u2019 Fans from across the name-change spectrum \u2014 the angry, the relieved, the saddened \u2014 told The Post they \u2018love\u2019 this decision because it buys time,\u201d Sam Fortier reports.ViralTROUBLE WITH THE CURVE: Anthony S.

There are so many crises going on,\u201d replied Romney (R-Utah). \u201cI\u2019m not sure which.\u201dThe 2012 GOP presidential nominee was not trying to be flip and lamented President Trump\u2019s response to the novel coronavirus when the reporter clarified. But our nation faces cascading crises: the worst civil unrest since 1968, the worst economic upheaval since 1933 and the worst public health emergency since 1918. This morning\u2019s jobs report shows another 1.4 million workers filed for unemployment benefits last week, the 18th straight week that more than a million Americans have filed claims.ADOther ongoing crises get less attention because of the contagion, but that does not mean they have been solved. There is an opioid crisis causing deaths of despair, the climate crisis that imperils the future of the planet, a looming sovereign debt crisis that most political leaders seem nonchalant about, rising great-power conflict with China, including a new space race, and fresh complications overnight in Afghanistan as America struggles to exit her longest war.ADProfessional sports offer a comfortable getaway from the challenges of life and the burdens of reality. For a few hours, and a few bucks, you can go to the ballpark and escape. That has always been part of the joy that comes with the price of admission.On this Opening Day of the Major League Baseball season, delayed by nearly four months because of the coronavirus, such escapism is impossible. Largely, this is because no one is safe from covid-19. To wit, the Kansas City Royals revealed Wednesday that Hunter Dozier, who hit 26 home runs last season, tested positive and will be placed on the injured list.ADThis abridged 60-game season, instead of the usual 162, will not be baseball as we know it; it might better be described as covidball. First off, there will be no spectators allowed in the stands, so all of us will be watching on television and fake crowd noise will be piped into the ballparks.There is supposed to be social distancing \u2013 and mask wearing \u2013 in the dugout. Players have been told not to give high-fives. Or spit. Or chew sunflower seeds. Coaches have been told they are not allowed to touch their faces.\u00a0ADTradition-bound Major League Baseball has made rule changes that would have been considered sacrilege not long ago, including introducing designated hitters in the National League and starting extra innings with an automatic runner on second base.\u00a0ADHistorically and culturally, baseball has been far less political and polarized than professional football and basketball. Players have tended to be less outspoken than their counterparts in other sports. (I touched on this in 2017 after completing a personal quest to watch games at all 30 major league stadiums.)But times are changing. The sport has not been immune to the national reckoning on racial injustice. San Francisco Giants manager Gabe Kapler and several of his players knelt during the national anthem earlier this week before an exhibition game, provoking an attack by Trump. \u201cLooking forward to live sports,\u201d he tweeted on Tuesday, \u201cbut any time I witness a player kneeling during the National Anthem, a sign of great disrespect for our Country and our Flag, the game is over for me!\u201dADIn a show of solidarity, \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d will be stenciled on several mounds across the league this weekend, including in Washington. The league has also given players the option to wear patches on their jerseys that use the phrase.ADThe topsy-turvy process that got us to Opening Day has itself been a metaphor for the country\u2019s broader struggle to control the virus. Baseball is the first of the big four sports to play a regular season game since March. The United States has lagged Europe and Asia in restarting professional sports. Players are being tested regularly now, but there have been long delays in turning around results \u2013 just like for the rest of society \u2013 that limit the values of the tests.\u00a0So often, it has felt like America just cannot catch a break these past few months. It is perhaps apt that the forecast calls for scattered thunderstorms to linger in Washington into the evening before tapering off after sunset.Tony Fauci, the government\u2019s top infectious-disease expert, will throw the ceremonial first pitch of the first game at 7 p.m. Eastern in Washington as the Nationals take on the New York Yankees. ESPN will broadcast it live. In a video released Wednesday by the Nationals, the 79-year-old Fauci said he was nervous about getting the ball past home plate. Washington star Ryan Zimmerman told him not to worry. \u201cIf you bounce it, there's nobody there to boo you,\u201d he quipped.ADADI will never forget flying to Houston last October to watch the Nationals win in the World Series with my dad. But it feels hard to believe that incredible playoff run was just nine months ago. It feels like nine years.The season opener is a doubleheader: The Dodgers will play the Giants tonight in Los Angeles after the Nationals-Yankees game. But San Francisco\u2019s star catcher Buster Posey will not play. He has opted to sit out the season because he and his wife adopted identical twin girls who were born prematurely, and he doesn\u2019t want to put them at risk. Among the dozen or so other stars skipping this season are Zimmerman, Atlanta\u2019s Nick Markakis, Los Angeles\u2019s David Price and Colorado\u2019s Ian Desmond.The members of my fantasy baseball league normally gather in the basement of a Capitol Hill bar for an annual draft. This year, we gathered virtually to respect social distancing protocols. We also waited to hold our draft until late last night because so many players kept announcing that they wouldn\u2019t play this season. None of us wanted to pay for pitchers and hitters who will not generate any stats for our teams.ADAD(For those who care about the game, the roster for \u201cThe 202s\u201d includes Gerrit Cole, Francisco Lindor, Clayton Kershaw, Nelson Cruz, Javier Baez, Jose Altuve, Matt Olson, Eddie Rosario and Kyle Schwarber. Picking Cole as one of my starting pitchers creates a somewhat awkward dynamic tonight because I will be cheering for the Nationals as the new Yankees ace starts against them. So it goes.)Everything comes with some risks amid the pandemic. The first road game for the Nationals will be against the Toronto Blue Jays. But no one knows where that game will take place because Canada is not allowing its sole MLB team to play in the country. On Wednesday, the state of Pennsylvania told the Blue Jays that they will not be allowed to play their home games this season at PNC Park in Pittsburgh, as they had hoped to do.\u201cIn recent weeks, we have seen a significant increase in the number of COVID-19 cases in southwestern Pennsylvania,\u201d said Rachel Levine, secretary of the state Department of Health, in a statement. \u201cTo add travelers to this region for any reason, including for professional sports events, risks residents, visitors and members of both teams. We know that this virus does not discriminate and can even make professional athletes very sick. We are committed to protecting the health and well-being of all Pennsylvanians.\u201dMore team coverage:Thomas Boswell: \u201cThis MLB season will be weird and not without risk. I can\u2019t wait.\u201dJesse Dougherty: \u201cThis was not the Opening Day the Nationals had planned, but at least it\u2019s here.\u201dDave Sheinin: \u201cThe baseball season starts Thursday.

(You can take it here.)The coronavirusAnecdotal evidence is mounting that you can get covid-19 twice, but doctors remain unsure.\u201cWhen Sophie Cunningham, a guard for the WNBA\u2019s Phoenix Mercury, returned to training last week after a bout with covid-19, she \u2026 said she believed she had been infected twice \u2014 once in March and then again in June or July,\u201d Carolyn Johnson and Ariana Eunjung Cha report. \u201cDaniel Griffin, an infectious diseases doctor and researcher at Columbia University Medical Center, said that with every virus \u2014 including chickenpox, for which antibodies are supposed to last a lifetime \u2014 there are cases of people who become sick again after recovering from the initial illness. When it comes to Ebola, American doctor Ian Crozier was declared free of the virus but then doctors found it lurking in his eye. In HIV/AIDS, a baby in Mississippi born to an HIV-positive mother was thought to be cured but then the virus reemerged 27 months after therapy was stopped. So in a world where 14.5 million people have had the coronavirus, a small number with resurgent sickness should not be cause for alarm. \u2026\u00a0ADAD\u201cAt the University of Pennsylvania, there was the pregnant woman infected in March who was fine for two months and then became so sick during childbirth she had to be put on a ventilator. At Cleveland Clinic, there was a patient with very mild symptoms in February \u2014 just a loss of smell and taste \u2014 who was well for two months, but then needed to be hospitalized in early May and was confirmed to have the virus again. And at ProHealth Care in Long Island, there was a man infected at the end of March who was never sick enough to be hospitalized. He showed up again in July, this time very ill. \u2018He thought he had an immunity shield, so he took care of his son when he got covid,\u2019 Griffin said. \u2018Two weeks later, he was in the ER.\u2019 The man, who had a very high antibody response the first time and donated his plasma so it could be used to treat other coronavirus patients, had barely any when doctors recently tested his blood in the hospital.\u201dThere are conflicting explanations for what\u2019s going on. \u201cFor severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), the antibodies seem to last for a year or longer.

The number of daily deaths on Wednesday surpassed 1,100, the first time that mark had been reached since May 29. And total deaths in the United States since the start of the pandemic increased to more than 140,000. California on Wednesday passed New York in the number of total confirmed coronavirus cases \u2026\u00a0\u201cWith transmission rapidly spiking in many areas, governors in Indiana, Minnesota and Ohio joined the growing number of states mandating face coverings statewide. More than 30 states require people to wear masks. \u2026 [Trump] declined to press for a nationwide mandate for masks, despite the near-universal urgings of public health experts. \u2026 On Wednesday, an influential model\u00a0created by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation \u2026 said wider mask-wearing by Americans had caused the institute to revise projections on how many people will die of covid-19 by Nov.\u00a01. Earlier, it had forecast 224,500 deaths by that date. Now, it estimates 219,900 deaths by Nov. 1 \u2014 a decrease of about 5,000 deaths. If 95 percent of Americans wore masks when leaving their homes, that number would drop further to 185,900, IHME researchers said.\u201dA Texas county is storing bodies in trucks because so many residents are dying.\u201cTexas, which reported 197 deaths and 10,893 hospitalizations, has been one of the states hardest hit by the resurgent coronavirus.

I lost my business to Covid so please make this easy and comply,'\" Renae Merle reports. \u201cAnother would-be robber in Florida, entered a Wells Fargo branch wearing sunglasses, gloves and a white cone-like mask over his face.

Of those, 22 million live in states that will accept fear of the coronavirus as an excuse to vote absentee, or have switched to become \u2018no excuse\u2019 states,\u201d Kate Rabinowitz and Brittany Renee Mayes report. \u201cThirty-four states and the District of Columbia already allowed anyone to vote absentee. But many of these places are making the process easier. California will start proactively mailing ballots to registered voters, joining universal vote-by-mail states such as Colorado. Many states will send every registered voter an absentee-ballot application. These types of statewide expansions affect another 63 million eligible voters. In some states like Nebraska, individual counties are planning to send mail-in voting applications in the absence of a statewide directive. For voters in nine states \u2013 Connecticut, New York, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina, Texas and West Virginia \u2013 in-person voting remains the only option unless they can provide an approved reason not related to fear of the coronavirus.

He could also spend weeks refusing to concede amid a legal war over which votes are valid and should be included in the tally \u2026 Or he could simply refuse to leave on Jan. 20. \u2026 This year, the president has attacked the security of voting by mail at least 50 times \u2026 There is no evidence that mail voting leads to the kind of massive fraud Trump has described. \u2026\u00a0\u201cIn GOP circles, private talk about Trump\u2019s assertions veers from alarm to shrugging off his comments as simply incendiary political salvos.

Can you do it?\u2019\u2019 Trump said, mimicking the doctors administering the exam. \u2018And you go, \u2018Person, woman, man, camera, TV.\u2019 They say, \u2018That\u2019s amazing. How did you do that?\u2019 I do it because I have, like, a good memory, because I\u2019m cognitively there.\u2019 \u2026 Experts say the president\u2019s fixation on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment \u2026 is particularly puzzling because the test is normally administered only if someone is concerned that they or their loved ones may be experiencing dementia or other cognitive decline.

He has equivocated about whether he accepts the U.S. intelligence community\u2019s consensus that Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election. He said during his Helsinki summit with Putin in 2018 that he believes the Russian president's denials.\u00a0ADADTrump has even expressed a willingness to benefit from foreign intervention. He told ABC News last year that he would not necessarily notify the FBI if a foreign country offered him dirt on an opponent. \u201cI think I\u2019d want to hear it,\u201d Trump said.\u00a0Also on Monday afternoon, the Democratic leaders in the House and Senate, plus the party\u2019s top members on the intelligence committees in each chamber, released a somewhat cryptic letter that they sent last week to FBI Director Chris Wray, with a classified appendix, asking for a full congressional briefing before the August recess. \u201cWe are gravely concerned, in particular, that Congress appears to be the target of a concerted foreign interference campaign, which seeks to launder and amplify disinformation in order to influence congressional activity, public debate, and the presidential election in November,\u201d wrote Speaker Nancy Pelosi, House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and Senate Intelligence Vice Chairman Mark Warner.Biden seems determined not to repeat the mistakes that he and many of his advisers apparently believe President Barack Obama made in 2016. Obama warned Putin privately to cut out what he was up to, and intelligence agencies released a statement calling out Russia that October, but the administration waited to impose penalties until after the election.ADADIn an excellent new book, \u201cRigged: America, Russia, and One Hundred Years of Covert Electoral Interference,\u201d David Shimer explores Putin\u2019s effort to undermine former secretary of state Hillary Clinton and boost Trump in 2016. \u201cPutin\u2019s perception of Obama is critical,\u201d Shimer argues. \u201cVladimir Lenin had a favorite saying: \u2018Probe with a bayonet; if you meet steel, stop! If you meet mush, then push!\u2019 Putin aimed to push as far as he could without provoking much pushback. And in Obama, he saw a leader elected to wind down wars, not start them, wary of stumbling into great-power conflict, and largely dismissive of Russia.\u201dShimer quotes alumni of the Obama administration lamenting their former boss\u2019s relative cautiousness, particularly the consequences of his failure to strike Syria after the regime used chemical weapons against civilians. He argues that this prompted Putin to charge forward \u201cwith his digital bayonet.\u201d\u201cThis was a cautious administration in general,\u201d retired Army Gen. David Petraeus, who led the CIA in 2011 and 2012, told the author. \u201cIt was an administration that had a redline that was crossed, and they didn\u2019t act, that said Bashar al-Assad must go, but then did nothing really to make him go, that repeatedly issued ringing rhetorical statements and policies and did not always back them up.\u201dADADLeon Panetta, who served as Obama\u2019s first CIA director and then secretary of defense, added: \u201cI think Putin read it as weakness, and read it as an opportunity to be able to not only do Crimea, but to go into Syria without having anyone stop him from doing that, and thirdly then going after our election institutions as well. I think he felt that he would be able to do it and get away with it.\u201dMichael Morell, who twice served as acting CIA director under Obama, told the author that the then-president\u2019s relative restraint when Putin annexed Crimea \u2013 he declined requests to send lethal arms to the Ukrainians to avoid escalation \u2013 emboldened the Russians to play in the 2016 U.S. election. \u201cI bet you any amount of money that was part of his calculation, whereas if the United States had pushed back harder on Crimea and on eastern Ukraine, then this might never have happened,\u201d Morell told Shimer. (Obama declined to be interviewed for the book.)In his Monday statement, Biden said he would \u201cprefer to focus\u201d his energies on \u201cbringing the international community together\u201d to combat the novel coronavirus pandemic and the economic pain it has caused, but he promised to use the full force of the federal government if he wins to make foreign aggressors pay. He said he would enlist the Department of Defense, the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, the Department of State and the FBI\u2019s Foreign Influence Task Force. \u201cThere's not much I can do about it now except talk about it, and expose it, but it is a serious concern,\u201d Biden explained at the fundraiser.\u00a0ADADTrump has refused to retaliate against the Kremlin amid intelligence that the Russians offered bounties for the killing of U.S. troops in Afghanistan, claiming that he was never briefed and then saying there was not enough solid information to act. He has repeatedly cast doubt upon the value of NATO, berating Western European allies and announcing plans to withdraw thousands of U.S. troops from Germany. Trump also retreated from strategically valuable positions in Syria, allowing Russian forces to seize what had been American encampments. Trump has delivered a series of other geopolitical gifts to Putin during his three-and-a-half years in power.\u201cIn spite of President Trump\u2019s failure to act,\u201d Biden wrote in his statement, \u201cAmerica\u2019s adversaries must not misjudge the resolve of the American people to counter every effort by a foreign power to interfere in our democracy, whether by hacking voting systems and databases, laundering money into our political system, systematically spreading disinformation, or trying to sow doubt about the integrity of our elections.\u201dA Yale-educated historian now earning his doctorate at Oxford as a Marshall Scholar, Shimer\u2019s 384-page book chronicles a century of Russian election interference operations going back to 1919, as well as CIA operations in Italy, Chile and elsewhere during the Cold War. Using declassified archives, Shimer documents KGB efforts to undermine Ronald Reagan during his 1976 primary challenge against President Gerald Ford, who was under fire from the right for pursuing detente.\u00a0ADADThe Soviets were also determined that year to undermine then-Washington Sen. Henry \u201cScoop\u201d Jackson\u2019s bid for the Democratic presidential nomination because of his hawkish views. Russian operatives searched unsuccessfully for dirt on him and then forged documents in a bid to falsely frame Jackson as a closeted homosexual as part of what was code-named Operation Vice, according to Shimer. Russians mailed copies of the phony documents to newspapers like the Chicago Tribune and the Los Angeles Times, as well as senators like Frank Church (D-Idaho) and Ted Kennedy (D-Mass.), but no one did anything with them.In the pre-Internet era, and before the launch of pro-Trump cable networks like One America News, the mainstream media\u2019s filter successfully prevented the Russian disinformation campaign from catching on. As Shimer explains, there was a gap between the intent of Soviet leaders and their actual capabilities. The digital era made such operations vastly easier for the Russians.Shimer writes that previous presidential candidates, including Adlai Stevenson and Hubert Humphrey, rejected overtures from Russian ambassadors to support their campaigns during the Cold War, which kept the Kremlin from wading in more deeply than it otherwise might have into domestic politics.ADADIn contrast, former Trump national security adviser John Bolton alleges in his memoir that Trump privately asked Chinese leader Xi Jinping last year to help him win reelection, which the president has denied. Trump was impeached by the House in December for allegedly abusing his power by pushing Ukraine\u2019s president to announce an investigation of Biden in exchange for military assistance and a coveted White House meeting, but the Republican-controlled Senate voted to acquit him. During the summer of 2016, Trump publicly called on Russia to find emails on Clinton\u2019s server. He later claimed he was joking.\u00a0In June, a Ukrainian lawmaker who was once affiliated with a pro-Russian political party and has met with Trump\u2019s private lawyer Rudy Giuliani released 10 edited snippets of what appeared to be Biden\u2019s official vice presidential phone calls in 2016 with Petro Poroshenko, then the president of Ukraine. It was the second cache of recordings the lawmaker, who studied under the KGB in Moscow in the early 1990s, has released since May. The authenticity cannot be verified.In February, Trump decided not to nominate Joseph Maguire as director of national intelligence after an official on his staff told lawmakers during a classified briefing that the Russians want to see the president reelected.\u00a0ADADLast week, security officials in the United States, Britain and Canada jointly warned that hackers linked to a Russian intelligence service are trying to steal information from researchers working to produce coronavirus vaccines.

Sources with knowledge of the situation have told Sean Sullivan that the black women being vetted include Rice, Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), Rep. Val Demings (D-Fla.), Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms and Rep. Karen Bass (D-Calif.).

Both countries have been censured by Brussels as their leaders have moved against their political opponents and stripped the independence of the judiciary.\u201dThe GOP's relief proposal will probably include payroll tax cuts and tie school money to reopening plans.\u00a0\u201cSome of these provisions are already sparking pushback from key Senate Republicans, and an even bigger showdown with Democrats appears inevitable,\u201d Erica Werner, Jeff Stein, Robert Costa and Seung Min Kim report. \u201cThat clash could come Tuesday, when Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows are set to meet with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) for the first bipartisan talks on what will almost certainly be the last major coronavirus relief bill before the November elections. Mnuchin and Meadows will also meet with Senate Republicans on Tuesday as they seek to quell any discontent. \u2026 Mnuchin said Monday that the White House wants the bill to amount to roughly $1 trillion in new programs, though officials are expected to use budget gimmicks to make the initial package slightly larger. Still, Democrats were looking for a much bigger bill. Their opening offer is a $3 trillion package they passed in May that would extend unemployment benefits, include new stimulus checks, and help cities and states, among other things.\u201dFollow the money: A bipartisan group of lawmakers called for scrutiny of a $700 million Treasury Department \"loan\" to the trucking company YRC Worldwide.\u00a0\u201cIn its latest report, the Covid-19 Congressional Oversight Commission expressed concern that taxpayers were likely to lose money on the loan, noting concerns about YRC\u2019s financial viability,\u201d Jeff Stein and Erica Werner report.Reps.

But there he was, the owner of a once-successful advertising agency, taking a sweaty nap in a Subaru wagon in a convention center parking lot at 1:45 a.m. on a Wednesday. The pandemic sent his business into a free fall, and now Jolley wanted to be first in line for an unemployment claims event beginning in five hours. He barely dozed, afraid that if he fell into a deep sleep, he would miss the early-morning handout of tickets for appointments with state agents. There would be just 400 tickets handed out for that day\u2019s event. When those ran out, there would be 400 more for appointments the following day,\u201d Annie Gowen reports. \u201cIn Oklahoma, one of the poorest states, unemployment \u2014 which reached a record 14.7 percent in April \u2014 has pushed many to the point of desperation, with savings depleted, cars repossessed and homes sold for cash. Even though the unemployment rate dropped to 6.6 percent in June, the backlog has created unprecedented delays. Oklahoma had approved 235,000 of about 590,000 filed claims by June 21 \u2014 a total $2.4 billion payout, far more than in previous years. About 6,000 state claims are pending.\u00a0\u201cThe Oklahoma Employment Security Commission staff has tried to combat the delays by holding mega-processing events at large arenas in Oklahoma City and Tulsa this month, with masks and social distancing required.

Now, the two oldest children, Nash and Nadeen, have had to push their grief aside to focus on keeping their family afloat. \u201c[Nash] opened his first bank account, then applied for unemployment and tried to figure out whether Nadeen might be eligible, too. He decided to use the donations to pay off the house, ensuring that he and his siblings would always have a place to live. \u2026 Like Nash, Nadeen struggled at first, burning a pot of red rice she tried to cook and bleaching her brother\u2019s clothes in the wash.

Subscribe today.arrow-rightThe president began his rambling 54-minute opening statement by announcing that he had signed congressional legislation that authorizes his administration to enact sanctions on banks that do business with Chinese officials and an executive order to revoke Hong Kong's special economic trading status. But he glossed over the specifics and said nothing about the pro-democracy protests in the city as he pivoted swiftly to his attacks on Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee.Trump lambasted Biden\u2019s record on Beijing, casting the former vice president and longtime senator from Delaware as soft on China during its rise to become the second-largest economy in the world. He faulted Biden for initially opposing his administration\u2019s decision to shut down some flights from China over the coronavirus, and he inaccurately stated that Biden \u201csided with China\u201d on its handling of the pandemic \u2014 even though Biden had sounded alarms months ago as Trump was still praising Chinese President Xi Jinping.ADADAnd he suggested that Biden has been critical of the United States while rooting for China\u2019s economic success, citing a July 4 video message during which Biden stated that U.S. history was \u201cno fairy tale.\u201d\u201cJoe Biden\u2019s entire career has been a gift to the Chinese Communist Party,\u201d Trump said.\u201cHe said the idea that China is our competitor is really bizarre. He\u2019s really bizarre,\u201d the president said. \u201cNobody\u2019s ripped us off more than China the last 25-30 years \u2014 nobody close \u2014 and he says China\u2019s not a problem? He wants to take it all back now. He wants to be Mr. Tough Guy.\u201dTrump didn\u2019t stop there, adding an attack on Biden\u2019s son Hunter, recycling a false portrayal of a business arrangement he had pursued with a private equity firm years ago while his father was serving as vice president. It was the latest in a long effort by Trump to hurl misleading or unfounded accusations at the Bidens \u2014 including the attempts to pressure Ukraine that led to his House impeachment in December.ADAD\u201cWhere\u2019s Hunter?\u201d Trump said, repeating a question he asked at a news conference last fall that became a popular meme among his conservative supporters. \u201cHe\u2019s unemployed, he didn\u2019t have a job, and all of a sudden he\u2019s making a fortune?\u201dWhite House aides had announced the Rose Garden event, which was not initially on Trump\u2019s public schedule, as a news conference, and the president fielded a handful of questions from reporters. But his real motive appeared to be his attacks on Joe Biden \u2014 a stunning display of partisanship in an exquisitely manicured setting that presidents have traditionally considered off-limits for direct and extended political attacks.In addition to the Bidens, Trump insulted Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), calling her \u201cnot talented,\u201d and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), mocking him for having a \u201cgood base\u201d of liberal supporters but failing to win the presidency in two campaigns.ADADThe Biden campaign struck back by blasting an email \u201cfact check\u201d to reporters while the president was still talking, accusing Trump of failing to \u201cget tough on China\u2019s government when it mattered most\u201d during the early outbreak of the coronavirus, which originated in the city of Wuhan, at a time when he was pursuing a trade deal with Beijing. The pandemic has killed more than 133,000 Americans and put millions out of work.\u201cDonald Trump is busy trying to rewrite his miserable history as president of caving to President Xi and the Chinese government at every turn,\u201d the Biden campaign wrote in the email, \u201cbut try as he may, Trump can\u2019t hide from a record of weakness and bad deals that consistently put China first and America last.\u201dTrump\u2019s job-approval ratings have tumbled in recent weeks amid his handling of the pandemic and his response to the racial justice protests that have roiled American cities. Having once hoped to center his reelection campaign around a strong economy, the president has struggled to find a new message while Biden has surged to a significant lead in national polling and a narrower lead in key battleground states.ADADThe two have sparred over China, and some Trump advisers have urged the president to pivot from his attacks on liberal protesters for desecrating statues of U.S. historical figures, including Confederate leaders, to go after Biden\u2019s record on China instead.Trump dumped almost an hour\u2019s worth of opposition research against his Democratic rival with less than four months to go before the election, hitting him over immigration, energy policy and the environment.\u201cThere\u2019s probably never been a time when candidates are so different,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe want law and order. They don\u2019t want law and order.\u201dThe president said he had asked some of his \u201cpeople\u201d for a list of Biden\u2019s platform issues before proceeding to read out several liberal policy proposals.ADThe list mirrored a lengthy Twitter thread posted last week by Trump\u2019s son Donald Trump Jr., in which he described the \u201cBiden-Sanders\u201d agenda as \u201cinsane.\u201dMuch of Trump\u2019s summary of Biden\u2019s policy proposals was false or misleading. For example, the former vice president has not proposed \u201cgovernment health care for all illegal aliens\u201d as the president claimed.\u201cJoe Biden is pushing a platform that would demolish the U.S. economy,\u201d Trump said.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "comment": "1.6k Comments", "topic": "Politics"}, {"cover": "", "title": "How major US stock indexes fared Friday", "date": "Jul 24, 2020", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/how-major-us-stock-indexes-fared-friday/2020/07/24/8bab4976-cdef-11ea-99b0-8426e26d203b_story.html", "keyword": "China and the world order", "website": "the Washington Post", "author": "", "content": "Stocks fell on Wall Street Friday as tensions flared again between the world\u2019s two largest economies and jitters continued over the fallout from the coronavirus.

Subscribe today.arrow-rightMy daughter, Chloe, and I were alone in this little oasis at Fuller Gardens on the New Hampshire seacoast, so we slipped off our masks. Misty ocean air cooled my face as I breathed in the smell of flowers. A fountain tinkled, a rabbit hopped across the grass, and the world beyond the garden hedge seemed to melt away. I felt like Alice in Wonderland, disoriented but eager to explore this pretty and peaceful world.ADLike so many Americans, I have been taking the same three walks around my neighborhood since March, thanks to the novel coronavirus. I canceled my 40th birthday vacation and got a refund on flights for work travel. I\u2019m grateful for my backyard, but I\u2019m frankly tired of staring at the same patch of grass every day.In Chicago, the tourist experience is a mix of the familiar and the foreignI won\u2019t be traveling this summer \u2014 or anytime soon \u2014 but my desire for novel experiences and new places hasn\u2019t gone away. In fact, it\u2019s gotten more intense knowing I can\u2019t have it. So when an acquaintance told me about a local public garden that had recently reopened after shutting down because of the pandemic, my imagination went into overdrive looking at pictures of it online. It was beautiful. One spot reminded me of a place I\u2019d visited in England the summer before. Another evoked a dewy fairyland. I looked at the garden\u2019s address and saw that it was a short drive from my house, yet I had never visited.Intrigued, I typed \u201cbotanical gardens near me\u201d into Google and saw even more pictures that called to mind bucket-list places such as Japan and Versailles. These gardens were close to my house \u2014 many less than a 30-minute drive \u2014 but I hadn\u2019t visited any of them. It was time to change that.A rush to get outdoorsI\u2019m not alone in my sudden desire to visit local botanical gardens. Data from around the country is showing an increase in visits to outdoor spaces this summer, and public parks, including botanical gardens, were the top spot that visitors to cultural institutions planned to return to in the wake of pandemic closures, according to Colleen Dilenschneider, data analyst and publisher of Know Your Own Bone, a market research website for cultural executives.ADADTo find places near you, \u00adPublicGardens.org, the website of the American Public Gardens Association, includes a map of its member gardens that\u2019s searchable by garden name or Zip code. Searching by location yields all the gardens within 150 miles.\u201cBotanical gardens are a known entity,\u201d says Joan Thomas, director of external relations for the association. \u201cThey\u2019re places of sanctuary, refuge, and calming places to be.\u201dPlus, \u201cthey\u2019re cared-for spaces,\u201d she adds, natural but organized, alive but orderly, combining the structure of a museum with the outdoor space of a park.Eager for something new but still wanting to stay safely outdoors, Chloe and I hit the road. Our first stop was Bedrock Gardens in Lee, N.H., where two miles of paths link 20 acres of cultivated gardens with woodland and meadows.ADAD\u201cIt is designed as a journey,\u201d Jill Nooney, who co-founded and owns Bedrock Gardens with her husband, told me later. \u201cA journey has to have a destination, and it has to have adventures along the way.\u201dAfter a \u2018lost spring,\u2019 U.S. public gardens prepare for an uncertain summerAt Bedrock Gardens, themed garden \u201crooms\u201d connect to one another along meandering paths like \u201cbeads on a necklace,\u201d Nooney says. The landscape also is peppered with pieces of Nooney\u2019s art, much of which she built with found objects. Some pieces recall the property\u2019s former life as a dairy farm \u2014 a pitchfork and shovels become the crowning pieces of a sculpture, and metal tractor seats transform into swivel chairs.Each garden room has a whimsical name that echoes its theme. The \u201cWiggle Waggle\u201d is an undulating, narrow water channel dotted with lotus and lilies, and \u201cConeTown\u201d is an ode to the dozens of conifers that grow there.ADADWhile it\u2019s possible to simply wander around and enjoy the landscape without any context, be sure to grab the map that comes with the suggested $10 donation for admission. It will deepen the experience, teaching visitors about everything from horticulture to history.\u201cThere are aspects in this garden that are based on French formal gardens, Asian gardens, medieval fruit growing,\u201d Nooney says.Chloe and I weren\u2019t the only visitors that day, but at times it felt like we were nearly alone in the 37-acre landscape, which was perfect for social distancing.\u201cThere aren\u2019t many things you can do safely with kids. Because it\u2019s so large it can easily incorporate 300 people,\u201d Nooney says. \u201cPeople are starved for safe outdoor activity. People are starved for something that refreshes the soul.\u201dADSeeking to refresh our souls a little more, Chloe and I got back into the car and headed 20 miles southeast to another, very different place: Fuller Gardens in North Hampton, N.H., which former Massachusetts governor Alvan T. Fuller built at his summer estate, Runnymede-by-the-Sea, in the 1920s and \u201930s.ADWhereas Bedrock Gardens felt quirky and fanciful, Fuller Gardens is decidedly more manicured, reflecting its elegant country estate history. An English perennial garden, formal rose garden, classical European sculptures and fountains, conservatory, dahlia display garden, and neat paths and hedgerows give the place an Old World feel.A few days later, Chloe and I visited yet another garden near our home, the one at the Stevens-Coolidge Place in North Andover, Mass., which is also part of a former country estate.Behind the estate\u2019s historic house, we explored around a French garden\u2019s vegetables and fruit trees, an elegant sunken walled garden with intricate wrought-iron gates, and an exuberantly flowering perennial garden filled with bearded iris, phlox and plume poppy.Local knowledgeVisiting such gardens is not only good for the spirit; it\u2019s also good for the gardener\u2019s imagination. After all, gardening is another activity that\u2019s gotten a boost during the pandemic.ADAD\u201cIdeas are free,\u201d Nooney says, encouraging budding landscape designers to take inspiration from the art within Bedrock Gardens\u2019 landscape, maybe by piling up some stones to make a cairn or inverting a pot to see how it looks.\u201cThere are tremendous things to be learned from botanic gardens around the country and around the world, but by focusing on local gardens, you can really see what will grow best in your own community,\u201d says Joann Vieira, director of horticulture for the Trustees of Reservations, which manages the Stevens-Coolidge Place and other properties throughout Massachusetts.Local botanical gardens could also help you satiate your wanderlust when far-flung travel isn\u2019t possible. At Fuller Gardens, you might feel transported by the Japanese Garden, where a traditional bamboo farming device called a shishi-odoshi \u2014 which uses water and noise to frighten away crop-eating animals \u2014 and a pond filled with bright orange koi add meditative, liquid sounds to the hushed space.Or you might feel dropped into a classic British novel. Wandering around the manicured rose beds at Fuller Gardens, I half expected to see Elizabeth Bennet strolling along the hedgerows with her nose stuck in a book, or Alice herself, chasing after the white rabbit.That global feeling is evident at the Arnold Arboretum of Harvard University, a 281-acre Frederick Law Olmsted landscape that\u2019s free and open to the public.ADAD\u201cWe\u2019re a tree museum. So when you come to the Arboretum you have the opportunity to see trees from all over the temperate world,\u201d says Arboretum spokesperson Jon Hetman, pointing to collections from China, Japan, Korea and Europe. The Arboretum\u2019s broad landscape and wide, paved walkways provide ample space for people to safely explore outside, he says, though the website suggests avoiding peak visitation hours. (The visitor center and indoor exhibits are closed.)Hetman believes that visiting botanical gardens can remind us of the \u201crestorative power of nature,\u201d and after being in some of these beautiful, serene places, I have to agree with him.\u201cWhile people are really feeling adrift and uncertain, gardens and nature itself can really offer a way to decompress and provide some guidance and solace,\u201d Vieira says.ADAD\n\nPecci is a writer in New Hampshire.

Among adults supporting Biden, 77 percent say they are certain to vote, up from 67 percent in May.Democrat Hillary Clinton won the national popular vote four years ago but lost in the electoral college because of narrow defeats across the industrial Midwestern states of Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania. Operatives involved in the contest agree the race is tighter in these battlegrounds than nationally.ADADThough Biden finds himself in an undeniably enviable position for a challenger, Clinton also led Trump in every national poll four summers ago. Democratic nominees John Kerry and Michael Dukakis both led in polls conducted during the summers of 2004 and 1988, respectively, only to lose in the fall.Moreover, the advantages of incumbency are significant. It has been 28 years since a president lost his bid for a second term.The country remains deeply polarized. The political environment has proven volatile. What will happen 100-plus days from now is unpredictable. What if a Supreme Court vacancy unexpectedly opens? What if Biden flubs in the debates? What if he picks a running mate who struggles to withstand the spotlight of national scrutiny?ADOur poll finds a lot of interest in the election: 86 percent of registered voters say they are certain to vote in November, higher at this point in any of the past three elections.ADBut the novel coronavirus injects layers of uncertainty related to forecasting turnout, with open questions about how millions will cast their ballots and whether mail-in voting might deter some people from participating. The poll finds that 59 percent of Americans say they prefer to vote in person, compared to 38 percent who say they would rather vote by mail.\u00a0\u201cTrump has repeatedly attacked voting by mail as subject to fraud, and the new survey shows that slightly more Americans say they think mail-in voting is vulnerable to significant levels of fraud, with 49 percent agreeing with that statement compared with 43 percent who say there are adequate protections to prevent significant fraud,\u201d Dan Balz and Scott Clement report. \u201cBut those percentages are driven by Trump\u2019s own party, with 73 percent of Republicans saying mail-in voting is subject to significant levels of fraud and 66 percent of Democrats saying there are adequate levels of protection against such problems.\u201dADThere are two other caution flags for Biden, who failed in his first two bids for the presidency. Despite the myriad of deeply reported blunders in the president\u2019s response to the cascade of crises enveloping the country, Trump and Biden are tied at 45 percent when respondents were asked who they think is the stronger leader.ADTrump still retains a narrow advantage on the economy, with 47 percent saying they trust him more and 45 percent saying they trust Biden more. That is down from an eight-point edge in March.Notably, Biden has a 20-point lead on who is more trusted to deal with the coronavirus, a 25-point advantage on race relations and a nine-point advantage on crime and public safety.Perhaps the best dynamic for Biden right now, though, is that voters across the ideological spectrum see this year\u2019s election mainly as a referendum on Trump\u2019s performance in office, whether they love or hate him. The president\u2019s overall job approval rating has dropped to 39 percent, with 57 percent disapproving \u2013 and 48 percent of Americans strongly disapproving.The Biden campaign plans to step up outreach to disillusioned Republicans. The Associated Press reports that former Ohio governor John Kasich, a candidate for the GOP presidential nomination in 2016, is expected to speak at the Democratic National Convention on Biden\u2019s behalf next month.ADADTrump has struggled to define his challenger, prompting him to change up his messaging and even his campaign team in recent weeks. Last Wednesday, he demoted campaign manager Brad Parscale to a digital-focused role and put Bill Stepien in charge. Trump has largely shifted from trying to cast the former vice president as \u201cSleepy Joe,\u201d with declining mental capacity, to portraying him as a far-left agent of chaos and destruction. White House senior adviser Stephen Miller has circulated dozens of bullet-pointed attacks on Biden that are at odds with reality and deeply ingrained public perceptions of Biden.\u00a0\u201cThe author of many of Trump\u2019s most pugilistic public statements, Miller has raised concerns to other White House aides that the campaign\u2019s messaging has not been tough enough on Biden \u2026 and a cadre of White House officials have begun working on campaign issues through their private email accounts and text message chains\u201d Michael Scherer and Josh Dawsey report. \u201cIn the talking points he distributed, Biden\u2019s elevation to the White House was described as an event that would \u2018surrender America and its citizens to the violent left-wing mob,\u2019 \u2018import terrorists,\u2019 and \u2018allow left-wing fascists to destroy America.\u2019 \u2026 (Biden launched his campaign with a video quoting the Declaration of Independence and has condemned the removal of statues that do not commemorate the Confederacy.)\u201dIn a pre-taped interview for \u201cFox News Sunday,\u201d Trump claimed that Biden wants to defund the police. In fact, the Democratic candidate has said he disagrees with that idea and even proposed increasing funding to departments that meet certain standards. Trump promised to produce proof for his assertion, which the campaign also levels in attack ads. \u201cThe White House has never sent us evidence,\u201d anchor Chris Wallace said as he aired the interview, \u201cbecause there is none.\u201d\u00a0I\u2019m back from vacation.I had a lovely time hiking, biking, kayaking, sailing and reading in Acadia National Park.

Confronted by Wallace with a chart showing that the number of coronavirus cases last week more than doubled from the spring peak in April, Trump replied: \u2018If we didn\u2019t test, you wouldn\u2019t be able to show that chart. If we tested half as much, those numbers would be down.\u2019 By the president\u2019s logic, that assumes people contract the virus only if they test positive, ignoring the fact that many people are asymptomatic carriers and unknowingly spread the contagion without taking a test or being reported. Wallace later explained to Trump that the number of tests has increased by 37 percent but the number of cases has shot up by 194 percent. \u2026\u00a0\u201cTrump and his aides recently have sought to divert attention from the soaring number of coronavirus cases by focusing on the rate of deaths. In the Fox interview, Trump falsely asserted, \u2018I think we have one of the lowest mortality rates in the world.\u2019 \u2018It\u2019s not true, sir,\u2019 Wallace replied. \u2018We had 900 deaths on a single day just this week.\u2019 Trump shouted to aides hovering nearby: \u2018Can you please get the mortality rates?\u2019 White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany quickly presented Trump with data she said was from Deborah Birx, a physician and the White House coronavirus response coordinator, backing up his claim. \u2018Number one low mortality fatality rates,\u2019 Trump claimed. At that point, Fox interrupted the taped interview for Wallace to explain to his viewers that according to data from Johns Hopkins University, the United States ranked seventh among 20 countries in mortality rate, worse than Brazil and Russia. \u2026\u00a0\u201cThe president called Anthony S. Fauci, the nation\u2019s top infectious-disease expert, \u2018a little bit of an alarmist.\u2019 \u2026 Trump also challenged the assessment of Robert Redfield, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, who again warned last week that the pandemic could worsen this fall when flu season begins, reflecting widespread scientific consensus. \u2018I don\u2019t think he knows,\u2019 Trump said of Redfield.\" Trump reiterated that the virus will just disappear at some point. \u201cYou know why? Because I\u2019ve been right probably more than anybody else,\u201d he said.Quote of the day\u201cThe president got bored with it,\u201d said GOP strategist Dave Carney, a top adviser to Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R), about Trump and the contagion. (NYT)Endangered GOP senators are under pressure as the Senate considers a new relief package.\u201cAs the Senate returns this week for a three-week sprint before the August break, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) is facing competing demands from President Trump and Republican senators, including some who are up for reelection in states hit hard by the virus and are coming under withering attacks by Democratic challengers over the pandemic,\u201d Seung Min Kim, Rachael Bade and Erica Werner report. \u201cIn particular, the expiration of an additional $600-per-week in unemployment insurance by July 31 is adding pressure on vulnerable GOP senators as 20 million to 30 million people remain out of work. McConnell and many other Republicans adamantly oppose extending the enhanced benefit at its current level, saying it discourages some from returning to work because they make more money by staying home. \u2026\u00a0ADAD\u201c[Republican Sen. Cory] Gardner said his constituents are pressing him for more federal assistance and said he supports extending the enhanced unemployment benefit, although he is open to an amount less than the additional $600 per week. He said he is also open to Democrats\u2019 demands for more aid for states and localities \u2026 The first-term Republican senator, who is facing former Colorado governor John Hickenlooper (D) on Nov. 3, said he conveyed his request to McConnell in a call. \u2026 Another at-risk Republican senator, Susan Collins of Maine, told reporters in her state last week that she is seeking more state and local aid \u2026 and a fresh round of aid for small businesses and education funding to help schools reopen. \u2026\u201cMcConnell is expected to unveil a pandemic relief proposal as early as Tuesday with a target value of $1 trillion, although some Republicans speculate that the figure could be larger. Extra attention is likely to be paid to the demands of vulnerable Republican senators, GOP officials said. \u2026 Trump is insisting on a cut in payroll taxes, which fund Social Security, as part of the next package, although few Republicans are warm to the idea and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) has repeatedly expressed opposition. \u2026\"The prime red line for Senate leaders has been liability protections. McConnell has a plan that offers schools, charities, businesses and medical workers a legal shield from being held responsible in coronavirus-related lawsuits unless there was gross negligence or intentional misconduct, according to a draft viewed by The Washington Post. The proposal has been shared with White House officials, who are reviewing it.ADAD\u201cMeanwhile, the states that have had the most dramatic spike in cases include Arizona, Georgia and Texas, all of which have Senate races in varying levels of competitiveness and where Democratic opponents have made the pandemic a central theme in their campaigns. \u2026 In Arizona, where case numbers are surging dramatically, polls have shown GOP Sen. Martha McSally well behind Mark Kelly, her Democratic challenger. Kelly, a former astronaut, has begun targeting ads toward Native American communities in the state, arguing that the federal government is ignoring their needs in the pandemic. He is calling for extending the enhanced unemployment benefit; McSally has not taken a position on the issue, according to a spokeswoman.\u201dMcConnell\u2019s draft plan leaves out many priorities for Democrats. The Kentuckian and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) will meet with Trump today to discuss the package before it\u2019s unveiled. \u201cThe administration and Senate Republicans have been clashing on some issues \u2014 including whether to include billions of dollars for coronavirus testing, contact tracing and other health-care priorities the administration opposes \u2014 and they are trying to form a unified front before starting talks with Democrats,\u201d Erica and Jeff Stein report. \u201cThe House passed a wide-ranging $3 trillion bill in May called the Heroes Act that Democrats insist represents their unity position, but Trump threatened to veto it and McConnell ignored it.\u201dAmerica\u2019s mishandling of the pandemic has defied most experts\u2019 predictions.\u201cIsabelle Papadimitriou, 64, a respiratory therapist in Dallas, had been treating a surge of patients as the Texas economy reopened. She developed covid-19 symptoms June 27 and tested positive two days later. The disease was swift and brutal. She died the morning of the Fourth of July,\u201d Joel Achenbach, William Wan, Karin Brulliard and Chelsea Janes report.\u00a0\u201cThe holiday had always been her daughter\u2019s favorite. Fiana Tulip loved the family cookouts, the fireworks, the feeling of America united. Now, she wonders whether she\u2019ll ever be able to celebrate it again. In mourning, she\u2019s furious. Tulip, 40, had seen her country fail to control the novel coronavirus. \u2026 \u2018I feel like her death was a hundred percent preventable. I\u2019m angry at the Trump administration. I\u2019m angry with the state of our politics. I\u2019m angry at the people who even now refuse to wear masks,\u2019 she said. \u2026\u00a0ADAD\u201cIn October, not long before the novel coronavirus began sickening people in China, a comprehensive review ranked the pandemic preparedness of 195 countries. The project \u2026 assigned scores to countries as a way to warn them of the rising threat of infectious-disease outbreaks. With a score of 83.5 out of 100, the United States ranked No. 1. How did the nation get caught so flat-footed? By not really trying, said Beth Cameron, who helped lead the project for the Nuclear Threat Initiative. The federal government punted the coronavirus response to the states, counties and cities, said Cameron, who was senior director for global health security and biodefense on the White House National Security Council and helped write a pandemic response plan under President Barack Obama. The team Cameron led was disbanded after Donald Trump took office. \u2026\u00a0\u201cKristin Urquiza, 39, said she tried warning her father, Mark \u2014 a lifelong Republican \u2014 against going out and risking infection. In their home state of Arizona, as leaders including Gov. Doug Ducey (R) sprinted to reopen in May and June, Urquiza could tell she was losing the argument. \u2018When the president, the governor and people on cable news are all saying one thing, how do you compete with that?\u2019 she said. \u2018He would push back. \u2018I hear what you\u2019re saying, but why would the governor say it\u2019s safe to go out if it\u2019s not true?\u2019\u2019 Her father died of the virus June 30. In the obituary she wrote, she lashed out at government leaders. \u2018He was a huge supporter of Trump and [Ducey]. He believed what they said. And they betrayed him,\u2019 she said in an interview.\u201dArizona reported 147 coronavirus deaths on Sunday, a new daily record, and 2,742 new cases.

(Karla Adam)China is using forced labor from Uighur concentration camps to produce masks.\u201cUighurs are a largely Muslim ethnic minority primarily from the Xinjiang region of northwest China. The program sends Uighurs and other ethnic minorities into factory and service jobs. Now, their labor is part of the P.P.E. supply chain. According to China\u2019s National Medical Products Administration, only four companies in Xinjiang produced medical grade protective equipment before the pandemic. As of June 30, that number was 51. After reviewing state media reports and public records, The Times found that at least 17 of those companies participate in the labor transfer program,\u201d the New York Times reports. Reporters \u201ctraced a shipment of face masks to a medical supply company in the U.S. state of Georgia from a factory in China\u2019s Hubei Province, where more than 100 Uighur workers had been sent.

So, he said, on Saturday evening, he headed to downtown Portland to ask them. \u2026 An officer trained his weapon on David\u2019s chest as several agents pushed him, sending David stumbling backward. But he regained his center and tried again. Another agent raised his baton and began to beat David, who stood unwavering with his arms at his sides. Then another officer unloaded a canister of chemical irritant spray into David\u2019s face.

The same day, the state\u2019s largest private employer, Walmart, announced it will implement a requirement that shoppers wear masks in its stores nationwide.Support our journalism. Subscribe today.arrow-rightThe developments represent the continuation of a Trump-era theme: big business moving into a void left by elected officials to provide leadership on an urgent public need. On issue after issue, from climate change to racial justice, corporate chiefs have been stepping up where the Trump administration has shied away.\u00a0But their pandemic response also demonstrates the folly of relying on that model: The Trump administration could have imposed a national mask-wearing mandate back in early April, when the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention first recommended the practice. Instead, President Trump chose to politicize the issue, mocking Democratic rival Joe Biden and others for donning face-coverings. And now four months into a pandemic that has claimed more than 134,000 lives and swollen the jobless ranks to some 18 million people, the nation remains a patchwork of rules on the matter and other obvious steps to stop the spread of the virus.Walmart\u2019s nationwide mandate could prove a watershed moment in the mask debate.There is already evidence that the announcement by the nation\u2019s biggest employer \u2014 a retail staple of rural and exurban Republican strongholds \u2014 is turning the tide on what had become another front in a toxic partisan fight.ADADHours after Walmart made its announcement, supermarket chain Kroger said it is following suit with a nationwide rule for shoppers in its stores that will take effect next week. Kohl\u2019s, too, announced it will require shoppers to mask up in its 1,100 nationwide starting Monday.And the National Retail Federation piggybacked on the Walmart announcement to encourage all retailers to adopt the policy, saying it hoped the news proves to be a \u201ctipping point\u201d on the matter. \u201cWorkers serving customers should not have to make a critical decision as to whether they should risk exposure to infection or lose their jobs because a minority of people refuse to wear masks in order to help stop the spread of the deadly coronavirus,\u201d the trade association said in its statement.General counsel for the federation, Stephanie Martz, suggested that Walmart\u2019s market and cultural pull could have an outsize impact. \u201cThe more stores that are able to make announcements like this, the more it will help move the needle culturally and make it accepted that this is what you do when you shop in an enclosed space,\u201d she said. \u201cThe fact that this has become politicized is really disappointing.\u201dWalmart wasn\u2019t first into the breach. It joins a list of major retailers that have already imposed mask-wearing requirements, including Apple, AT&T, Costco, Dollar Tree, H-E-B, Starbucks and Verizon. And half the states now have adopted mandates, with Alabama the latest to announce one Wednesday. But Arizona and Florida, two epicenters of the pandemic\u2019s resurgence, remain among the holdouts. In Georgia, another hotspot, Gov. Brian Kemp (R) issued an executive order Wednesday banning cites and counties from adopting their own face-covering requirements.The holes in the national patchwork show the limits of corporate leadership in a public health crisis.Trump donned a mask in public for the first time Saturday.

The same day, the state\u2019s largest private employer, Walmart, announced it will implement a requirement that shoppers wear masks in its stores nationwide.Support our journalism. Subscribe today.arrow-rightThe developments represent the continuation of a Trump-era theme: big business moving into a void left by elected officials to provide leadership on an urgent public need. On issue after issue, from climate change to racial justice, corporate chiefs have been stepping up where the Trump administration has shied away.\u00a0But their pandemic response also demonstrates the folly of relying on that model: The Trump administration could have imposed a national mask-wearing mandate back in early April, when the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention first recommended the practice. Instead, President Trump chose to politicize the issue, mocking Democratic rival Joe Biden and others for donning face-coverings. And now four months into a pandemic that has claimed more than 134,000 lives and swollen the jobless ranks to some 18 million people, the nation remains a patchwork of rules on the matter and other obvious steps to stop the spread of the virus.Walmart\u2019s nationwide mandate could prove a watershed moment in the mask debate.There is already evidence that the announcement by the nation\u2019s biggest employer \u2014 a retail staple of rural and exurban Republican strongholds \u2014 is turning the tide on what had become another front in a toxic partisan fight.ADADHours after Walmart made its announcement, supermarket chain Kroger said it is following suit with a nationwide rule for shoppers in its stores that will take effect next week. Kohl\u2019s, too, announced it will require shoppers to mask up in its 1,100 nationwide starting Monday.And the National Retail Federation piggybacked on the Walmart announcement to encourage all retailers to adopt the policy, saying it hoped the news proves to be a \u201ctipping point\u201d on the matter. \u201cWorkers serving customers should not have to make a critical decision as to whether they should risk exposure to infection or lose their jobs because a minority of people refuse to wear masks in order to help stop the spread of the deadly coronavirus,\u201d the trade association said in its statement.General counsel for the federation, Stephanie Martz, suggested that Walmart\u2019s market and cultural pull could have an outsize impact. \u201cThe more stores that are able to make announcements like this, the more it will help move the needle culturally and make it accepted that this is what you do when you shop in an enclosed space,\u201d she said. \u201cThe fact that this has become politicized is really disappointing.\u201dWalmart wasn\u2019t first into the breach. It joins a list of major retailers that have already imposed mask-wearing requirements, including Apple, AT&T, Costco, Dollar Tree, H-E-B, Starbucks and Verizon. And half the states now have adopted mandates, with Alabama the latest to announce one Wednesday. But Arizona and Florida, two epicenters of the pandemic\u2019s resurgence, remain among the holdouts. In Georgia, another hotspot, Gov. Brian Kemp (R) issued an executive order Wednesday banning cites and counties from adopting their own face-covering requirements.The holes in the national patchwork show the limits of corporate leadership in a public health crisis.Trump donned a mask in public for the first time Saturday. But he continues to resist a federal mandate, and that is costing lives and dragging out the economic recovery.

Subscribe today.arrow-rightThe United States has dispatched two aircraft carrier strike groups to the South China Sea to contest China\u2019s creeping annexation of the maritime region. It is one of the bluntest expressions of U.S. hard power in years.Yet the very fact that such a dramatic step was even necessary indicates how the power balance is shifting in China\u2019s favor. China\u2019s long-term and methodical attempt to dominate shoals and islands in the region is a reflection of both U.S. domestic distractions and its loss of prestige throughout Asia.ADWhile the United States is half a world distant from Asia, China is Asia\u2019s geographical, demographic, economic and military organizing principle. Asians simply cannot escape the Chinese. For them to align with the United States in the face of China\u2019s immovable presence has always required faith in the word and commitment of the United States to this vast region. But for the first time since World War II, a U.S. president has shaken that faith to its core.ADDonald Trump began his presidency by abrogating the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the years-in-the-making trade, investment and political cornerstone of a U.S.-led liberal order in Asia. Trump tore up this historic framework in the face of China\u2019s own grand strategy for Eurasia: the Belt and Road Initiative. While China was promoting a vision, however imperfect and coercive, the United States deliberately has had nothing to offer.It gets worse.ADThe basis of Asian security since World War II has been the United States-Japan treaty alliance. By anchoring the United States to Asia\u2019s second-strongest nation, Washington elegantly contained Beijing, allowing states from Japan south to Australia to get rich off China\u2019s economic growth, while the United States provided for their security. No nation had to choose between the United States and China. And no nation had to fear Japanese militarism ever again.ADYet, since before he was inaugurated, Trump has questioned the very foundation of the treaty alliance: providing for Japan\u2019s defense. This has terrified the Japanese, and the region, to a degree unprecedented in the post-World War II era. The United States\u2019 standing in Japan and the region has been demonstrably weakened.Meanwhile, Japan has been mired in a vicious trade war with South Korea for a year now \u2014 a conflict that has its origins in contentious World War II history. Another administration might have dispatched an assistant secretary of state to Tokyo and Seoul to conduct vigorous shuttle diplomacy in order to quickly extinguish the issue and repair the alliance. But the Trump administration has done relatively little.ADThere is now a feeling of exposure and loneliness among the United States\u2019 Asian allies. For the first time since President Richard M. Nixon went to China in 1972, the United States\u2019 bilateral relationship with China is both hostile and unpredictable, even as Washington has provided its friends in the region with less reassurance than at any time since the Korean War 70 years ago.ADChina\u2019s pulverizing repression of the Turkic Muslim Uighurs in Xinjiang province, followed by its security crackdown in Hong Kong and its continued aggression in the South China Sea, suggests that Taiwan may be next in Beijing\u2019s sights \u2014 as a nation bordering the South China Sea and the only part of historic China yet to be forcibly brought to heel. Taiwan, like West Berlin during the Cold War, is an outpost of freedom in stark opposition to the authoritarian mainland. Its symbolism should not be underestimated. Were Taiwan\u2019s independence ever compromised, it would signal the end of the United States\u2019 preeminent influence not only in Asia but far beyond.Taiwan is not about to be invaded by China. Yet it is unclear how much it can rely on the United States in a crisis. Alliances depend on deterrence. Deterrence, in turn, rests on an unshakable moral commitment to a common strategy. Yet we are witnessing unprecedented Chinese aggression coupled with unprecedented doubts about U.S. intentions. Rather than lead an alliance, Trump has emerged as merely a transactor for whom nothing is sacred. It will take more than two aircraft carriers to repair this impression and the damage it has caused.ADWhat is now tethering the United States\u2019 Asian allies to Washington is less confidence in the United States than outright fear of China. But if this situation goes on, what may start to emerge is a creeping Finlandization, in which the United States\u2019 erstwhile Asian allies are careful not to interfere with Beijing\u2019s objectives, while they continue to pay lip service to Washington. Like the case with Soviet influence over Finland during the Cold War, their foreign policies will no longer be wholly independent. ADConsider Vietnam, which has both a land border with China and a bloody history with it. Vietnam\u2019s vulnerable geography makes it prone to greater Chinese influence were Trump to become even more unreliable. The case is similar with the Philippines, Malaysia and Singapore. We can never take these countries for granted.It is all about geography: China\u2019s very size and proximity make a sturdy and unquestioning U.S. regional order essential for the power balance in Asia.Read more:Robert D.

Malaysian and U.S. prosecutors had alleged the bond sales provided one of the means for associates of ex-Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak to steal billions from the fund. Najib is on trial on multiple corruption charges after his election ouster in May 2018. Goldman and 19 of its former executives were also charged in the fraud.___Airbus moves to end 16 years of litigation, end US tariffsADPARIS \u2014 European planemaker Airbus says it is taking the last step to end 16 years of litigation with the United States at the World Trade Organization. The manufacturer said it will end a system of financial support from France and Spain that the WTO had deemed illegal and unfair to Airbus rival Boeing. The Trump administration used the case as justification to slap tariffs on $7.5 billion worth of European exports. The U.S. tariffs covered not only Airbus planes but also a range of typical European exports, from gouda cheese to single-malt whiskey.AD___Schlumberger slashes 21,000 jobs amid pandemic oil routHOUSTON \u2014 Schlumberger is cutting more than 21,000 jobs as the global coronavirus pandemic quashes demand for energy and oil prices are routed. The company will pay more than $1 billion in severance benefits. The job cuts announced Friday, about a quarter of its entire workforce, puts the number of people employed by the world\u2019s largest oilfield services company close to where it was at the start of the oil and gas fracking boom that upended global energy markets and put the U.S. on top.

The Commerce Department reported that the June gain pushed sales of new homes to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 776,000. The increase followed a 19.4% jump in May sales. The sales increase for new homes sales followed a report Wednesday that sales of previously owned homes surged 20.7% in June to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.72 million. Even with the gain, which followed three months of declines, new home sales remain roughly 20% below pre-pandemic levels.ADAD___Intel\u2019s stock plunges as work on new computer chip bogs downSAN RAMON, Calif. \u2014 Intel is falling further behind in the race to build faster and more powerful computer chips, a nagging problem that may force the Silicon Valley pioneer to seek help from other manufacturers as it scrambles to catch up in the technological arms race. The sobering news emerged late Thursday when Intel disclosed that there will be a six-month to one-year delay on its development of a next-generation chip already being shipped to some of its rivals by a major Taiwan supplier, TSMC. Intel\u2019s stock plunged nearly 16% Friday to wipe out more than $40 billion in shareholder wealth.AD___Wall Street down after worldwide slide; gold at record highNEW YORK \u2014 Stocks fell on Wall Street Friday as tensions flared again between the world\u2019s two largest economies, jitters continued over the fallout from the coronavirus and companies turned in a mixed batch of earnings. The S&P 500 lost 0.6%. Markets fell more sharply across Asia and Europe after China ordered the closure of the U.S. consulate in the western city of Chengdu. All the uncertainty helped gold rise to a record closing high of almost $1,900 an ounce, beating the all-time high it set in 2011.AD___AP-NORC poll: Nearly half say job lost to virus won\u2019t returnWASHINGTON \u2014 Nearly half of Americans whose families experienced a layoff during the coronavirus pandemic believe those jobs are lost forever. That\u2019s according to an Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll. It\u2019s a sharp change from April, when 78% of those in households with a job loss thought they\u2019d be temporary. It\u2019s a sign of increasing pessimism that would translate into roughly 10 million workers needing to find a new employer, if not a new occupation. Still, the poll shows 72% of Americans would rather have restrictions in their communities to stop the spread of COVID-19 than remove them to help the economy.AD___White House, GOP at odds over jobless aid in virus billWASHINGTON \u2014 Negotiations over the next COVID-19 rescue bill are in flux. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell sent senators home for the weekend, promising a Republican proposal would be ready on Monday. Outraged Democrats warned that time is wasting on GOP infighting as the virus worsens. One sticking point for Republicans trying to develop their plan with the White House is how to trim back a $600 unemployment benefit boost.

Republicans proposed $200 a week, saying the generous bump discourages people from returning to work. Democrats call the added benefits a lifeline for those who have lost their jobs.ADTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and White House chief of staff Mark Meadows worked through the weekend on the GOP proposal and have agreed to negotiate with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Democratic Senate leader Chuck Schumer. House Democrats passed a $3 trillion relief package a couple of months ago.ADIn Europe, rising infections in Spain and other countries caused alarm only weeks after nations reopened their borders in hopes of  reviving tourism. Over the weekend, Britain imposed a 14-day quarantine on travelers arriving from Spain, Norway ordered a 10-day quarantine for people returning from the entire Iberian peninsula, and France urged its citizens not to visit Spain\u2019s Catalonia region.Scientists set speed records getting vaccines into massive testing just months after the coronavirus emerged. But they stressed that the public shouldn\u2019t fear that anyone is cutting corners.AD\u201cThis is a significant milestone,\u201d NIH Director Francis Collins said after the first test injection of Moderna\u2019s vaccine was given, at 6:45 a.m. in Savannah, Georgia. \u201cYes, we\u2019re going fast, but no, we are not going to compromise\u201d on proving whether the vaccine is safe and effective.AD\u201cWe are focusing on speed because every day matters,\u201d added Stephane Bancel, CEO of Massachusetts-based Moderna.After volunteers get two doses a month apart, scientists will closely track which group experiences more infections as they go about their daily routines, especially in areas where the virus is spreading unchecked.The answer probably won\u2019t come until November or December, cautioned Dr. Anthony Fauci, NIH\u2019s infectious-diseases chief.Among many questions the study may answer: How much protection does just one dose offer compared with the two scientists think are needed? If it works, will it protect against severe disease or block infection entirely?ADADDon\u2019t expect a vaccine as strong as the measles vaccine, which prevents about 97% of measles infections, Fauci said, adding he would be happy with a COVID-19 vaccine that\u2019s 60% effective.Several other vaccines made by China and by Britain\u2019s Oxford University began smaller final-stage tests in Brazil and other hard-hit countries earlier this month. But the U.S. requires its own tests of any vaccine that might be used in the country.Every month through the fall, the government-funded COVID-19 Prevention Network will roll out a new study of a leading candidate, each with 30,000 volunteers.The final U.S. study of the Oxford shot is set to begin in August, followed by a candidate from Johnson & Johnson in September and one from Novavax in October.ADThat\u2019s a stunning number of people needed to roll up their sleeves for science. In recent weeks, more than 150,000 Americans filled out an online registry signaling interest, Collins said. But many more are needed.ADNIH is working to make sure that the study isn\u2019t just filled with healthy, younger volunteers but includes populations hit hardest by COVID-19, including older adults, those in poor health and African-Americans and Latinos.\u201cWe really are going to depend upon that sense of volunteerism for individuals from every different corner of society if we\u2019re going to really find out how this vaccine, and its potential to end this terrible pandemic, is go to work in each of those groups,\u201d Collins said.___The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Department of Science Education.

It\u2019s a job it doesn\u2019t want \u2014 and that the White House doesn\u2019t want it to have.It\u2019s not clear when, or if, the logjam will break.A spokesman for the National Space Council said fully funding the Office of Space Commerce \u201cremains a top priority\u201d to \u201caddress the emerging growth of large constellations in low Earth orbit and lay the foundation for management of future space traffic.\u201dADOthers are less optimistic that such an office will be established.AD\u201cThe odds of getting legislation introduced this year, in an election year, on a topic of low political priority, were slim to begin with,\u201d said Brian Weeden, the director of program planning at the Secure World Foundation, a think tank. \u201cAnd then we had a pandemic.\u201dAs the debate drags on, the number of satellites being launched to orbit continues to grow dramatically, raising the possibility of more collisions and more debris that in turn would threaten other satellites that are used for missile warnings, GPS, television, communications and more.At least four companies are moving ahead with plans to put up constellations of thousands of satellites that would beam the Internet to the estimated 4 billion people without access to broadband. Over the next 10 years, more than 50,000 satellites could be launched into orbit, up from the few thousand currently in operation today, according to Analytical Graphics Inc., or AGI, a company based outside Philadelphia that builds software to track spacecraft and debris in space. That\u2019s in addition to the junk floating around there. The Pentagon tracks about 22,000 pieces of debris larger than about four inches, but scientists say there are nearly 1 million larger than half an inch.ADADAGI estimates that over the next 10 years, there could be as many as 404 collisions and 17 million close calls in the most congested orbits. Tracking all those objects and issuing warnings is too much for the Pentagon to handle \u2014 and outside its primary task of defending the nation. A civilian agency could be more adept in keeping up with the demand and better at communicating with private companies as well as foreign governments, some experts believe, though the Pentagon would continue to monitor space activity.\u201cIt\u2019s easier for the Department of Commerce to leverage commercial or other modern technology than it is for the Pentagon,\u201d Weeden said. He called the Pentagon\u2019s current tracking system \u201cantiquated.\u201d\u201cIt was a great system 30 years ago, and it did the job it was designed to do,\u201d Paul Graziani, AGI\u2019s CEO, said in an interview. \u201cHowever, the problem has moved on over the decades to be a much more difficult problem than the system was designed to handle.\u201dADADSpaceX has won approval from the Federal Communications Commission to put 12,000 small satellites into orbit as part of its Starlink Internet constellation. Already it has launched 540, making it one of the largest satellite operators in the world, officials said, with more satellites in space than even China.Companies currently need to demonstrate that their individual satellites won\u2019t cause collisions to win FCC approval, Weeden said, but some experts want additional regulations that would extend to the constellations as a whole.Amazon, meanwhile, also has plans to deploy a large constellation as part of a program it calls Kuiper. The FCC on Thursday approved Amazon\u2019s plan to put up 3,236 satellites, and the company said it would invest $10 billion in the effort. (Amazon founder and chief executive Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)ADAD\u201cA project of this scale requires significant effort and resources, and, due to the nature of LEO constellations, it is not the kind of initiative that can start small,\u201d Amazon said in a statement. \"You have to commit.\u201dAnother company, OneWeb, intends to launch hundreds of satellites for broadband service, despite a bankruptcy filing that led to its acquisition by the British government and an Indian company.With all that activity, analysts say the U.S. government needs to move fast if it is going to be able to keep up and establish policies for the rest of the world to follow.\u201cA collision between two satellites could have a catastrophic impact on the space environment for centuries to come,\u201d FCC chairman Ajit Pai said recently.ADIn April, the FCC, which over the past year has approved some 13,000 new satellites for launch, updated its rules governing orbital debris for the first time since 2004. Satellite applicants must now provide numerical values for the risk of collision and demonstrate how their satellites will be disposed of at the end of their missions, as well as make upgrades to design that would help avoid collisions.ADWhile the rule updates are a good step forward, \u201cthere is still more we need to do,\u201d FCC Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel said in April. The commission considered tightening a rule that allows a satellite to stay in orbit for up to 25 years after its mission ends, a time frame that many think is far too long. But ultimately, the commission did not make any changes.\u201cThis rule simply does not make sense in today\u2019s orbital environment,\u201d Rosenworcel said.ADDebris begets more debris, and collisions, officials say, are inevitable and can inflict serious damage. In orbit, objects travel at immense speed \u2014 the International Space Station, for example, whizzes around Earth at 17,500 mph. So even something the size of a peanut can do tremendous harm.Though outfitted with material intended to protect against debris strikes, the space station from time to time has had to maneuver to avoid getting hit. There even have been a few close calls in which ground controllers didn\u2019t have time to move the station out of the way. In those cases, the astronauts had to evacuate the station and seek refuge in a docked spacecraft in case a collision caused the station to depressurize.ADIn one of the most congested areas, about 430 to 560 miles high, \u201cthere is enough human-generated orbital debris \u2026 to create more debris even if no new satellites were launched,\u201d Weeden told a congressional committee this year.ADCatastrophic collisions could occur between every five to seven years, he said.The first-ever satellite crash happened in 2009, when a dead Russian satellite collided with a communications satellite operated by Iridium, creating almost 2,000 pieces of debris at least four inches in diameter and thousands more smaller pieces. Much of the debris will remain in orbit for years to come, each a threat to other spacecraft.This year, two dead satellites nearly collided. If they had, it would have created yet another field of debris that could have threatened other satellites. And with more satellites being launched, the chance of more close calls and collisions will only rise.AD\u201cWe\u2019re going to see an even steeper exponential growth in the number of close calls,\u201d said Todd Harrison, an aerospace analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \u201cWe cannot afford to have more collisions because it produces long-lasting debris that ultimately could limit our ability to use this part of space. It could have far-reaching economic consequences as well as strategic consequences if we screw up that area of space we use for security.\u201dOne of the reasons the Trump administration moved so aggressively to form the Space Force, the newest branch of the military, was to defend U.S. assets in space, which are used for reconnaissance, guiding precision munitions and communications. But the Space Force doesn\u2019t want to be in the business of warning companies and governments every time one of their satellites comes uncomfortably close to another.\u201cThey don\u2019t want to be in the business of doing warnings for everyone on the world,\u201d Harrison said. \u201cThat\u2019s not a military function.\u201dTo transfer that authority to the Commerce Department, as the Trump administration called for two years ago, Congress would have to allocate funds and give the agency the authorization to do so.SpaceX, however, is moving quickly and says it could begin offering Internet service from its Starlink constellation in the United States in Canada this year, while \u201crapidly expanding to near global coverage of the populated world by 2021.\"In a discussion with reporters late last year, Gwynne Shotwell, SpaceX\u2019s president and chief operating officer, said that Starlink will be able to serve remote areas that fiber hasn\u2019t reached.\u201cDoes anyone like their Internet?\u201d she said. \u201cAnyone? Anyone? Nope. Anybody paying less than like 80 bucks a month for crappy \u2026 service? No. Okay, there we go. That\u2019s why we\u2019re going to be successful.\u201dThe company has said that it has taken steps to ensure its new satellites won\u2019t exacerbate the debris problem. The satellites are outfitted with thrusters and can \u201cautonomously perform maneuvers to avoid collisions with space debris and other spacecraft,\u201d the company said. \u201cThis capability reduces human error, allowing for a more reliable approach to collision avoidance.\u201dAt the end of their lives, the satellites would take themselves out of orbit and burn up in the atmosphere. And if those propulsion systems don\u2019t work, they\u2019ll automatically fall out of orbit within one to five years, the company said, significantly faster than the 25 years allowed now.", "comment": "117 Comments", "topic": "Space"}, {"cover": "", "title": "Experimental COVID-19 vaccine is put to its biggest test", "date": "Jul 27, 2020", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/experimental-covid-19-vaccine-is-put-to-its-biggest-test/2020/07/27/ad5106a0-d02a-11ea-826b-cc394d824e35_story.html", "keyword": "China and the world order", "website": "the Washington Post", "author": "", "content": "The biggest test yet of an experimental COVID-19 vaccine got underway Monday with the first of some 30,000 Americans rolling up their sleeves to receive shots created by the U.S. government as part of the all-out global race to stop the pandemic.Support our journalism.

The White House said he has mild symptoms and \u201chas been self-isolating and working from a secure location off site.\u201dADThe move to restart the national pastime ran into trouble just five days into the long-delayed season: Two major league baseball games scheduled for Monday night were called off as the Miami Marlins coped with an outbreak \u2014 the Marlins\u2019 home opener against the Baltimore Orioles, and the New York Yankees\u2019 game in Philadelphia, where the Marlins used the clubhouse over the weekend.ADAs for relief from the economic damage done by the virus, Republicans on Capitol Hill rolled out a $1 trillion package that includes another round of $1,200 direct payments but reduces the extra $600 a week in federal unemployment benefits that expire for millions of Americans on Friday. Republicans proposed $200 a week, saying the generous bump discourages people from returning to work. Democrats call the added benefits a lifeline for those who have lost their jobs.Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and White House chief of staff Mark Meadows worked through the weekend on the GOP proposal and have agreed to negotiate with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Democratic Senate leader Chuck Schumer. House Democrats passed a $3 trillion relief package a couple of months ago.ADIn Europe, rising infections in Spain and other countries caused alarm only weeks after nations reopened their borders in hopes of  reviving tourism. Over the weekend, Britain imposed a 14-day quarantine on travelers arriving from Spain, Norway ordered a 10-day quarantine for people returning from the entire Iberian peninsula, and France urged its citizens not to visit Spain\u2019s Catalonia region.ADScientists set speed records getting a made-from-scratch vaccine into massive testing just months after the coronavirus emerged. But they stressed that the public shouldn\u2019t fear that anyone is cutting corners.\u201cThis is a significant milestone,\u201d NIH Director Francis Collins said after the very first test injection was given, at 6:45 a.m. in Savannah, Georgia. \u201cYes, we\u2019re going fast, but no, we are not going to compromise\u201d on proving whether the vaccine is safe and effective.AD\u201cWe are focusing on speed because every day matters,\u201d added Stephane Bancel, CEO of Massachusetts-based Moderna.After volunteers get two doses a month apart, scientists will closely track which group experiences more infections as they go about their daily routines, especially in areas where the virus is spreading unchecked.ADThe answer probably won\u2019t come until November or December, cautioned Dr. Anthony Fauci, NIH\u2019s infectious-diseases chief.Among many questions the study may answer: How much protection does just one dose offer compared with the two scientists think are needed? If it works, will it protect against severe disease or block infection entirely?Don\u2019t expect a vaccine as strong as the measles vaccine, which prevents about 97% of measles infections, Fauci said, adding he would be happy with a COVID-19 vaccine that\u2019s 60% effective.ADSeveral other vaccines made by China and by Britain\u2019s Oxford University began smaller final-stage tests in Brazil and other hard-hit countries earlier this month. But the U.S. requires its own tests of any vaccine that might be used in the country.ADEvery month through the fall, the government-funded COVID-19 Prevention Network will roll out a new study of a leading candidate, each with 30,000 volunteers.The final U.S. study of the Oxford shot is set to begin in August, followed by a candidate from Johnson & Johnson in September and one from Novavax in October. Pfizer Inc. plans its own 30,000-person study this summer.That\u2019s a stunning number of people needed to roll up their sleeves for science. In recent weeks, more than 150,000 Americans filled out an online registry signaling interest, Collins said. But many more are needed.ADNIH is working to make sure that the study isn\u2019t just filled with healthy, younger volunteers but includes populations hit hardest by COVID-19, including older adults, those in poor health and African-Americans and Latinos.AD\u201cWe really are going to depend upon that sense of volunteerism for individuals from every different corner of society if we\u2019re going to really find out how this vaccine, and its potential to end this terrible pandemic, is go to work in each of those groups,\u201d Collins said.___The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Department of Science Education.

The query came weeks after the agency ousted the board and leadership of Voice of America, a sister agency, and refused to extend the visas of international journalists working for it.ADADThe fund said Namdar sought the visit Tuesday, the day a panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit blocked similar staffing changes sought by the agency over the fund. The court said the Agency for Global Media appeared to have no authority to appoint or control the fund\u2019s board members or operations.\u201cThese latest actions by the USAGM are extremely troubling, particularly coming just one day after the court\u2019s order,\u201d wrote attorney Deepak Gupta, who represents the fund and four board members who filed suit. \u201cWe hope that the government will decide to stop escalating its efforts to take over the OTF while this case is pending.\u201dAppeals court blocks Trump appointee Michael Pack\u2019s takeover of organization fighting digital censorship and surveillanceThe Justice Department declined to comment. A spokesperson for the Agency for Global Media said it and its officials are unable to comment on ongoing litigation.ADADThe dispute marks the latest controversy under Trump\u2019s appointee to head the agency, Michael Pack, a conservative filmmaker and associate of former White House chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon.Since being confirmed June 4, Pack has fired the top officials and bipartisan board of entities overseen by the agency, which include VOA and four U.S. government-funded news outlets: Radio Free Europe, Radio Free Asia, Middle East Broadcasting Networks and the Open Technology Fund. The fund combats Internet censorship and surveillance by developing technology working with foreign activists, journalists and technology developers.Critics, including leading Republican senators, have accused Pack of jeopardizing a model cultural export and globally trusted source of news and information sponsored by the United States that has helped undermine oppressive regimes around the world.ADADTrump and the White House, during Pack\u2019s two-year confirmation battle, portrayed Voice of America as an out-of-control news organization that has distributed \u201cpropaganda\u201d favorable to regimes in China and Iran \u2014 a claim vigorously disputed by VOA. Pack\u2019s aides have complained of \u201cbias and partisanship\u201d and unspecified but \u201cknown mismanagement and scandals.\u201dDeclining to extend visas at VOA is leading dozens of employees to fear for their jobs and make other plans, threatening production of its many non-English language programs and newscasts, current and former employees said.In a declaration filed in court, Nathaniel Kretchun, Open Technology Fund vice president of programs, said he found Namdar\u2019s inquiries Wednesday \u201cparticularly alarming\u201d because some employees and partners work to advance \u201cfree expression of repressive regimes,\u201d and threats to their status could jeopardize their personal safety.ADADKretchun said Namdar asked several questions about the size of the fund\u2019s staff, their employment status and U.S. citizenship. He said at one point Namdar \u201cbegan filming and narrating,\u201d accompanied by USAGM public affairs director Jonathan Bronitsky, who appeared to record the session with his smartphone.Kretchun said he felt \u201cuncomfortable\u201d because several of Namdar\u2019s questions seemed potentially relevant to the pending lawsuit, he is not a lawyer and the fund had no counsel present. But he said he \u201chad no choice\u201d but to try to answer because Namdar\u2019s email the previous day \u201cappeared to threaten OTF\u2019s grant funding if we did not comply with her inspection or her requests to interview personnel.\u201dGupta asked Justice Department civil division appellate attorney H. Thomas Byron in a letter to counsel his agency client to stop taking \u201cinappropriate, escalating actions.\u201dADADGupta asked the government to confirm by Friday that it will preserve any records and evidence of the inspection, channel all litigation-related communication through attorneys handling the case and cease efforts to access the fund\u2019s offices.Begun as a Radio Free Asia pilot project in 2012, the Open Technology Fund has grown into an independent D.C. nonprofit grantee, incorporated last year and appropriated $20\u2009million by Congress.The group has funded programs in 60 countries with more than 2\u2009billion people to allow secure access to the Internet and U.S.-sponsored news and information, including through tools such as Signal and Tor, which permit users to encrypt communications and anonymously access the Internet despite government controls.

Vietnam swiftly routed the virus.\u201dADADChina, too, for all its questionable governance and behavior during the pandemic, managed to curb the spread of the virus. President Trump\u2019s America, by contrast, has yet to flatten the curve of a first wave as infections soar across the country. (On Thursday, Florida and California reported their highest daily death tolls yet.) Its struggles may come to mark a historic inflection point: the moment the world\u2019s preeminent superpower had to relinquish a certain vision of its own primacy as other countries \u2014 especially some rising powers in Asia \u2014 led the way.\u201cCovid-19 has exposed the world\u2019s greatest democracies as victims of prolonged self-harm,\u201d wrote Mishra, pointing to both the United States\u2019 punitively expensive health-care system and the hollowing out of Britain\u2019s social services. \u201cIt has also demonstrated that countries with strong state capacity have been far more successful at stemming the virus\u2019s spread and look better equipped to cope with the social and economic fallout.\u201dThis lack of capacity, contend some analysts, was long in the making. \u201cAmerica and Britain\u2019s poor responses to Covid-19 can be traced partly to post-cold war self-congratulation \u2014 the belief that neither had much to learn from the rest of the world,\u201d wrote Edward Luce of the Financial Times. \u201cIn a few short months a microbe has exposed the underside to Anglo-American hubris.\u201dADADAnd that hubris is no small thing \u2014 it\u2019s in many ways at the heart of the ideological project that sculpted the post-World War II international order, the \u201cAnglo-Saxon\u201d principles of laissez-faire liberal democracy that seemed irrevocably ascendant until not so long ago. \u201cHalf a millennium of potted history tells Anglo-Americans they are destined always to be on the winning side,\u201d Luce added. \u201cIt blinds both to how the rest of the world increasingly views them, which is with sadness and growing mockery.\u201dSince the late 20th century \u2014 dubbed by Time magazine\u2019s founder as the \u201cAmerican Century\u201d \u2014 there has been talk of the 21st century as the Asian one. It took several geopolitical shocks for the vision of the \u201cAmerican\u201d century to take hold, including the bloodiest war in human history. The pandemic may be another epochal jolt to the system, reshaping how we think about the course of global affairs.It\u2019s not just about the waning clout of a divided, dysfunctional America. For years, U.S. policymakers have recognized the eastward shift of the geopolitical center of gravity and sought to \u201cpivot\u201d their strategic concerns toward a region that boasts the majority of the world\u2019s population and soon the largest share of its economic output. But now, instead of setting the terms of a hemispheric \u201cPax Americana,\u201d they find themselves adjusting to new realities forged elsewhere.ADADIn the age of the coronavirus, Asia\u2019s dramas have become global ones. A deadly standoff between Indian and Chinese forces in the Himalayas heralded the advent of a new 21st-century fault line separating two nuclear powers. The existential threats facing free societies in Hong Kong and Taiwan have galvanized support throughout the West. The ponderous deliberations in Europe about its political future now cannot be made without an eye to the Far East.A lot of this, of course, has to do with China, singled out for its increasingly assertive and aggressive actions at home and abroad. The Trump administration has opted for confrontation, launching a trade war with Beijing, but it has also unnerved traditional allies in Asia. \u201cFor the first time since President Richard M. Nixon went to China in 1972, the United States\u2019 bilateral relationship with China is both hostile and unpredictable, even as Washington has provided its friends in the region with less reassurance than at any time since the Korean War 70 years ago,\u201d Robert D. Kaplan observed in The Washington Post.Chinese officials insist that such rivalry is unnecessary. \u201cThe world should not be viewed in binary thinking, and differences in systems should not lead to a zero-sum game,\u201d Foreign Minister Wang Yi said in a speech Thursday, seeking to tamp down tensions with Washington. \u201cChina will not, and cannot, be another U.S.\u201dADADBut the competition between both countries is undeniable and casts the rest of Asia in its shadow. In a recent essay, Singaporean Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong cited a famous 1988 exchange between Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping and Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, in which the former is said to have told the latter: \u201cIn recent years, people have been saying that the next century will be the century of Asia and the Pacific, as if that were sure to be the case.

Subscribe today.arrow-rightYesterday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo unveiled the draft report of the Commission on Unalienable Rights, a group headed by former U.S. ambassador to the Vatican Mary Ann Glendon. Pompeo launched the commission last year to deal with an \u201curgent\u201d human rights problem: too many people claiming too many rights.That\u2019s right \u2014 the burning human rights problem for the Trump administration is not that the president encouraged the construction of concentration camps for religious minorities in China, or that he legitimizes murderous dictators such as Kim Jong Un. It\u2019s not Trump\u2019s flagrant violation of the laws protecting refugees fleeing persecution, or that he feels a special kinship with the \u201cvery fine people\u201d chanting \u201cJews will not replace us.\u201d And it\u2019s certainly not that black Americans are dying at the hands of police in a criminal justice system rife with institutional racism.ADADNo, it\u2019s that too many \u201csubgroups\u201d \u2014 read, women, LGBTQ people, black people, poor people, native peoples \u2014 are demanding rights, including (gasp) in \u201cdomestic political discourse.\u201d America\u2019s rights tradition is under attack, Pompeo claimed, by people who have forgotten a fundamental truth: \u201cAmerica is special. America is good.\u201dPompeo has suggested that the commission\u2019s job is simply one of \u201cclarification.\u201d But while he pines for the post-World War II clarity of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Pompeo\u2019s puzzlement makes one wonder whether he\u2019s ever actually read the document. The answers are all right there; you don\u2019t need a special commission to find them.Born out of the crucible of WWII and the Holocaust, the declaration asserts in its opening lines the \u201crecognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights\u201d of all humans. In a powerful preamble and 30 concise articles, it enumerates these \u201cinalienable rights,\u201d making clear that all of them \u2014 civil and political but also economic, social and cultural \u2014 are interrelated and must be treated as indivisible in order to fulfill the promise of human dignity. It is a simple and radical document \u2014 a Magna Carta for all humankind.ADADSo what, then, is the Pompeo commission really about? Pompeo\u2019s speech yesterday left little doubt. Contrary to the declaration\u2019s premise that the rights it enumerates are interdependent, Pompeo construes his commission\u2019s report as endorsing a sort of human rights cafeteria plan, in which \u201cproperty rights and religious liberty\u201d are the truly unalienable rights, while others are ad hoc (and therefore, presumably, alienable). Pompeo relies on the commission\u2019s findings as cover to assert what he wanted from the beginning: a defense of the view that freedom of religion trumps other rights. The not-so-subtle intent here is to shore up the president\u2019s waning support among the white Catholic and evangelical Christian Americans who make up his political base.Though Pompeo promised \u201cfresh thinking\u201d on human rights, his tactic \u2014 elevating some rights above others on a claim of cultural context \u2014 is sadly familiar. Notorious human rights violators throughout history and around the world have used \u201cre-examining\u201d human rights as a pretext for denying rights to people in disfavored groups. The Chinese government advocates human rights with \u201cChinese characteristics\u201d to justify denying basic civil and political rights to its citizens, particularly to Uighurs. Authoritarian governments such as those in Russia and Saudi Arabia justify discrimination against LGBTQ people and women as a defense of \u201ctraditional values.\u201dWhile Pompeo rightly suggests that the U.S. commitment to human rights at home \u201chas provided a beacon of hope for men and woman abroad pursuing their own liberties,\u201d his approach will not help rights defenders in places such as Iran and China. Rather, his insistence on redefining and reexamining universal human rights only strengthens the hand of governments that seek to silence human rights advocates by claiming authority to reinterpret rights in their own \u201cdistinctive\u201d way or by dismissing or discrediting universal rights as an \u201cAmerican\u201d invention.ADADWhat the global human rights movement needs right now is for the United States to fully embrace the universality and indivisibility of human rights as set out in the Universal Declaration, provide a full-throated defense of human rights abroad and engage in an honest effort to address deep and persistent rights violations at home. It\u2019s clear that Pompeo has no intention of leading such an effort; to the contrary, he is actively undermining it. To the extent that he tries to leverage the commission\u2019s report as cover for his campaign to \u201cprioritize\u201d freedom of religion over other universal rights, American officials \u2014 and Congress, in particular \u2014 must be prepared to push back.The good news is, no matter what governments say or do to \u201creinterpret\u201d human rights, rights belong to people, not to governments. And, ultimately, people will demand that they be respected. For evidence of that right now, one need only look to the streets of the United States.Read more:The Post\u2019s View: We knew Trump didn\u2019t care for human rights in China.

Subscribe today.arrow-right1. What\u2019s at stake?The Geneva-based WTO\u2019s mission of economic integration is under threat from protectionist policies around the globe, and without reform it risks being sidelined during the biggest economic crisis in a century. The world\u2019s largest economies agree that the organization must evolve to address the shifts in technology and the global trading system that have occurred since 1995. If members can align behind a candidate committed to modernization, it could break bureaucratic logjams and help unleash a wave of global growth at a time when it is needed most. If no such candidate can be found, the WTO risks further receding into irrelevance.ADAD2. What\u2019s precipitated the crisis?The WTO\u2019s appellate body, the main forum for settling worldwide trade disagreements, lost its ability in December 2019 to rule on new dispute cases. That resulted from a U.S. refusal over the previous two years to consider any nominees to fill vacancies on the panel. WTO members can still bring disputes to the trade body and receive an initial ruling, but that can be appealed into legal limbo. The U.S. imposition of hundreds of billions of dollars worth of tariffs against China, and use of the WTO\u2019s national security loophole to levy duties on steel and aluminum, have also weakened the organization.3. What is the WTO\u2019s selection process?ADThe chairman of the WTO General Council launched a selection procedure in June to confirm the trade body\u2019s next director-general. WTO members had sought to truncate the six-month process into just three in order to avoid a leadership vacuum in September, but it\u2019s likely a new candidate won\u2019t be selected until after the U.S. presidential election in November. During this time, the candidates will present themselves to the WTO\u2019s membership, campaign for support and sit for a question-and-answer session with the WTO General Council. Then the WTO\u2019s three highest-ranking delegates, known as \u201cthe troika,\u201d will consult with the membership and try to build a consensus around a final candidate.AD4. Who is running?\u2022 Mohammad Maziad Al-Tuwaijri, Saudi Arabia\u2019s former minister of economy and planning.AD\u2022 Liam Fox, the United Kingdom\u2019s former secretary of state for international trade.\u2022 Jesus Seade Kuri, Mexico\u2019s chief negotiator of USMCA and a former WTO deputy director-general.\u2022 Abdel-Hamid Mamdouh, an Egyptian attorney at King & Spalding LLP and former services division director at the WTO.\u2022 Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, Nigeria\u2019s former finance minister and former managing director of the World Bank.\u2022 Amina Chawahir Mohamed Jibril, Kenya\u2019s former international trade minister.\u2022 Tudor Ulianovschi, Moldova\u2019s former minister of foreign affairs.\u2022 Yoo Myung-hee, South Korea\u2019s trade minister.5. What credentials are required?WTO rules require candidates to have \u201cextensive experience in international relations, encompassing economic, trade and/or political experience; a firm commitment to the work and objectives of the WTO; proven leadership and managerial ability; and demonstrated communications skills.\u201dADAD6. What kind of leader are nations looking for?Governments hope the next WTO director-general can persuade members to complete the much-needed reform of the organization. Trade officials in Geneva broadly argue that Azevedo\u2019s successor should have sufficient leadership authority and capability to marshal broad support around the WTO\u2019s reform agenda. That means strong consideration should be given to candidates who have, at the very least, some experience as a minister.7. Is there a nationality requirement?No. However, trade officials from the U.S., EU and Canada say the next WTO director-general should come from a developed country due to their belief that the organization\u2019s leadership should rotate between developed and developing countries. Not all delegates agree on this, however, and representatives from African nations argue that it\u2019s their continent\u2019s turn to take on the top mantle of the WTO.ADAD8. Should a woman lead the WTO?There is a strong push among Geneva trade delegates to select a woman to lead the WTO for the first time. However, free-trade advocates like Wendy Cutler, vice president of the Washington-based Asia Society Policy Institute, argue that WTO members should try to avoid placing gender constraints on the selection process.9. Are there any other considerations?The candidate must also thread a narrow diplomatic needle that displeases neither the U.S. nor China, whose bitter conflict over the pandemic is testing their fragile economic truce. The Trump administration has actively sought to undermine the WTO\u2019s ability to function, saying it has infringed on American sovereignty and enabled China to become a big economic player globally at the expense of U.S. jobs and manufacturing. Adding to the unpredictability factor, President Donald Trump -- who has called the WTO the worst trade deal the U.S. has ever signed -- is up for re-election in November, so America\u2019s tolerance for a candidate who looks too favorably on China might be tested. Meanwhile, China has engaged in a multi-year campaign to expand its diplomatic influence by installing key personnel at the top levels of international decision making bodies.10. What happens if no candidate is selected?One of the WTO\u2019s four deputy directors-general may serve as an interim caretaker if the WTO\u2019s members cannot agree on a consensus nominee by Sept. 1. They are Yonov Frederick Agah of Nigeria, Karl Brauner of Germany, Alan Wolff of the U.S. and Yi Xiaozhun of China.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P.", "comment": "0 Comments", "topic": "Business"}, {"cover": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/YAYIU7VQYMI6VGFVE6NGI6NB4Q.jpghttps://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/YAYIU7VQYMI6VGFVE6NGI6NB4Q.jpg", "title": "Biden is the wrong choice to lead the West through Cold War 2.0", "date": "Jul 12, 2020", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/07/12/biden-is-wrong-choice-lead-west-through-cold-war-20/", "keyword": "China and the world order", "website": "the Washington Post", "author": "Hugh Hewitt", "content": "If by some stroke of fortune former vice president Walter Mondale had defeated President Ronald Reagan in the 1984 election, would the Soviet Union still exist today, still hold Eastern Europe in its thrall?

We can also recall the savaging Reagan took for his alleged lack of intellect and his blunt approach to the Soviets.The central issue of the current campaign ought to be the nature and ambitions of the Chinese Communist Party \u2014 its reckless disregard for the world in the early stages of the coronavirus outbreak, its repression of Hong Kong, what may be genocidal treatment of the Uighurs and its plans to dominate not just the South China Sea but the international order for decades to come. The election of 2020, like that of 1984, ought to turn on which candidate is best equipped to deal with the country\u2019s most significant adversary. Today, that is the general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party, also the president-for-life of the People\u2019s Republic of China, Xi Jinping.ADADThe left has long liked to attack conservatives for a supposed lack of intelligence and sophistication, along with alleged warmongering and other crimes. One of my favorite novels, John Irving\u2019s \u201cA Prayer for Owen Meany,\u201d is marred by this twitch. It was published in March 1989, an unfortunate mere eight months before the fall of the Berlin Wall. It is full of the then-conventional contempt for Reagan that accompanied the nuclear freeze movement, that condemned Reagan\u2019s deployment of Pershing II and cruise missiles in Europe, his embrace of strategic nuclear defense \u2014 derided as \u201cStar Wars,\u201d first by Sen. Edward M. Kennedy and then everywhere on the left \u2014 and, of course, opposition to Reagan\u2019s support for the contra rebels of Nicaragua, which reached hyper-pitch as Iran-contra scandal unfolded.\u201cThe White House, that whole criminal mob, those arrogant goons who see themselves as justified to operate above the law \u2014 they disgrace democracy by claiming what they do, they do for democracy,\u201d Irving has his narrator rail. \u201cThey should be in jail,\u201d he huffs after labeling Reagan an \u201cold geezer\u201d and slamming him with the innuendo of Hollywood stupidity routinely traded in by anti-Reagan newspaper columnists in those days.Now it is Trump taking the slings and arrows of the left, only with far more velocity and fervor, given the evolution of media. That unrelenting chorus of hatred doesn\u2019t change the central question: Who best to deal with the CCP: Trump or former vice president Joe Biden? Trump has been accused of being both too hard and too soft on Xi, Biden of being simply absent or compromised.ADADThe CCP uses loans and debt collection around the world the way the Soviets supported Cuban troops in Africa in the 1980s. Its military buildup is vast and rapid. The CCP\u2019s relentless campaigns of espionage make the Soviets of John le Carr\u00e9 novels seem quaint. Who is better equipped by disposition and experience to deal with the Dragon the way that Reagan dealt with the Bear?Trump\u2019s record and approach here are broad and familiar, as are the praise and criticism of that record. How about Biden\u2019s? Former secretary of defense Robert Gates famously wrote in 2014 that Biden \u201cbeen wrong on nearly every major foreign policy and national security issue over the past four decades.\u201dGates was a guest recently on my radio show to discuss his new book, \u201cExercise of Power.\u201d I asked him about Biden and specifically that comment. \u201cYeah, I stand by that statement,\u201d Gates replied. \u201cI will say, Hugh, it related mainly to things that had happened in the Cold War,\u201d he added, and expanded on the theme:ADAD\u201cBiden voted against every single arms program, I think, that Ronald Reagan put up on the Hill. He voted for the Iraq war and so on. So I do have those policy differences with him. In the Obama administration, we did have a very deep disagreement on Afghanistan. And that was a big deal.\u201d Gates noted occasional agreement with Biden on matters, including President Barack Obama\u2019s policies on Libya and Egypt, but he added:\u201cI also think that the vice president had some issues with the military. And I wrote in \u2018Duty\u2019 [Gates\u2019s memoir] about how he would warn the president that he was being boxed in, that the military was trying to take away his options and so on. And he\u2019d kind of rail at the generals. And that bothered me some. So you know, there are puts and takes with any presidential candidate. He brings a decency and an integrity and so on to the race, but I did have these issues with him.\u201d ADADThose are the words of an individual trusted by presidents of both parties to be secretary of defense and whose long career of public service enjoys a rare bipartisan esteem.For those focused on the central issue \u2014 the existential threat to the country and indeed the West \u2014 the choice of Trump is obvious. Gates did not say so, but if past is prologue, Biden would be to the CCP as President Jimmy Carter was to the U. S. S. R.: naive and paralyzed.Read more:Robert C.

She got herself a volunteer hobby that brought some order and connectivity to her isolated, splintering world. When her two children are napping, she sits at the kitchen table in her 850-square-foot bungalow in Lawrence, Kan., opens her computer and dials strangers on her cellphone, hoping to trace the spread of the novel coronavirus in Wyandotte County.ADADSometimes she\u2019s able to gather good data for the health department, and to help recovering citizens navigate their way back to work, and she feels as if we\u2019re in this together.Sometimes people balk at the intrusion. A few weeks ago a man answered the phone while coughing and struggling to breathe. He told her \u201cdon\u2019t worry about me\u201d and hung up.\u201cThat made me so sad,\u201d says Sanchez, 32. \u201cI hope he\u2019s okay.\u201dLast week the county\u2019s contact tracers were 500 cases behind, she says, with 70 new ones piling up every day. She feels like a citizen trying her best, in a nation that isn\u2019t really doing the same.\u201cI don\u2019t know if anyone has biffed anything as bad as the federal government biffed their management of this,\u201d she says.This test of solidarity and public trust couldn\u2019t have come at a worse time. America\u2019s mask has slipped. There is a feeling of failure, of being repeatedly victimized by a virus despite our supposed exceptionalism. National pride in the United States has fallen to a record low, according to Gallup, and only 1 in 5 Americans is satisfied with the direction of the country \u2014 a steep drop from four months ago, when satisfaction was at a 15-year high. Forty-nine percent of whites \u2014 also a record low \u2014 say they are \u201cextremely proud\u201d to be an American; for nonwhite Americans the rate is half that.ADADPerhaps we ignored our preexisting conditions for too long. In 1979, Jimmy Carter admitted to a national \u201ccrisis of confidence,\u201d in the wake of Vietnam and Watergate and energy shortages. But then we shut our eyes and pictured Ronald Reagan\u2019s \u201cshining city,\u201d as wealth oozed upward. We believed Bill Clinton\u2019s pep talk about how our best qualities excused our worst, which included prioritizing mass incarceration. We cloaked George W. Bush\u2019s costly foreign policy in pageant-style patriotism and then believed Barack Obama\u2019s insistence that Americans were not as divided as we seemed. Meanwhile, big banks crashed the economy and got bailed out, white people in rural areas started dying \u201cdeaths of despair,\u201d black people kept getting killed by police at disproportionately high rates, and more Americans turned to conspiracy theories to make sense of it all and prescription pills to blunt the pain.Then a minority of voters elected as president a salesman who built his empire on fraud, spectacle and bankruptcy. Three years and 20,000 \u201cfalse or misleading claims\u201d later, the reality-show presidency is reaching a dramatic first-season climax marked by mass death, rampant joblessness, tens of millions of people in the streets.Josh Harrison is trying to ride it all out until November, hoping at least for a political cure. Harrison runs a small pest-control business in North Carolina and voted for Donald Trump in 2016. He regrets it mightily. This year was the breaking point, particularly when Trump suggested that perhaps the virus could be killed by injecting disinfectant into the body. Then, watching the lack of Republican leadership in the wake of Floyd\u2019s death, Harrison started questioning whether he even belonged in the party.ADADSo one night last month, after some red wine and White Claw, he sat on his deck about 2 a.m. and hit record on his phone. Shirtless and smoking a Marlboro Light, Harrison said that for the first time in his life he would be voting for a Democrat. Then he submitted the homemade video to Republican Voters Against Trump, which has been releasing similar testimonials. Harrison\u2019s video has since been viewed over 1.1 million times.\u201cTrump doesn\u2019t have to build a wall because Mexico is closing its border to us,\u201d he says by phone. \u201cWe can\u2019t travel.

Institutions have been deteriorating and failing us for generations, she says, but we rigged workarounds with our own social networks and mutual-aid groups. We made do. Then the pandemic scattered us, isolated us, exposed us for what we really are.\u201cAll these years after the Civil War, are we still just a union of states \u2014 or have we become a nation of people?\u201dADADThat\u2019s the question Shermer will ask the students in her U.S. history survey course. She\u2019s watched governors battle the president and states squabble over stocks of personal protective equipment. Meanwhile the movement of Black Lives Matter has behaved like a nation of people, demanding something more, something holistic, something that was promised centuries ago.The coronavirus is \u201cfueled upon the systemic injustices in our country,\u201d says Cedric Dark, an emergency-room physician and assistant professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston. The contagion doesn\u2019t just spread because of proximity or air droplets; it feeds on disparity in housing, insurance, transportation, wages, child care, food security. Our current failure is built on previous failures.Coronavirus is a test that no one knows how to passDark grades the U.S. response to our crises with a C-minus. \u201cI think some states are going to pass and some states are going to fail,\u201d he says. \u201cSo Georgia, Arizona, Florida and Texas are going to fail this test, until they listen.\u201dADADIn Texas, the volume of covid-19 cases is 10 times higher than it was in the spring, Dark says. Hospitalizations are seven times higher; deaths are five times higher. Last week, a man came into Dark\u2019s hospital worried about his low blood sugar. He had no covid-19 symptoms, but a check of his vitals revealed a blood-oxygen level of 89 percent: perilously low. An X-ray showed a white, fluffy buildup all over his lungs.\u201cIt\u2019s everywhere,\u201d Dark says. \u201cAnd everyone keeps claiming we\u2019re alarmist, but when we in the ER are panicking now, and telling you what we\u2019re going through, listen. Because we don\u2019t normally panic.\u201dThe next test that we\u2019ll pass or fail, according to Dark, is whether we send our children back to school. As a kind of trial run, Hannah Lebovits sent her two children to a day camp in Plano, Tex., the last week of June. The camp did everything right, she thought, but within two weeks the news arrived via email: one symptomatic child and multiple counselors had tested positive for covid-19.\u201cI knew it,\u201d says Lebovits, 27, an incoming assistant professor of public administration at the University of Texas at Arlington. \u201cI just knew it. I knew in my heart that this is what was going to happen.\u201dLebovits studies social sustainability, and how government creates or degrades it. Through the lens of her work, she sees this year\u2019s crises as a total failure of government and institutions.ADAD\u201cWe\u2019re being gaslit by this country that everything will be fine if we just get back to work,\u201d Lebovits says. \u201cWe\u2019re focused on economic stability, business revitalization, what the economy is going to look like after covid \u2014 not what we\u2019re going to look like after covid. My kids are going to need a s--- ton of therapy. I\u2019m going to need therapy. It\u2019s just overwhelming. I see this as impacting countless Americans for so long. I want to say a single decade, but it\u2019s going to be longer than that.\u201d The irrefutable evidence of mismanagement \u2014 the 140,000 deaths, the police violence across the country \u2014 has made many people realize that \u201cwe don\u2019t need to be nice to our institutions anymore.\u201dThe pandemic isn\u2019t over. But America sure seems over it.In his 1998 book \u201cThe American Century,\u201d Harold Evans wrote about the nation\u2019s \u201cinner light of freedom.\u201d Since then, he says, the pursuit of freedom has become reckless. Democracy has become transactional. An isolated America has plunged into a \u201cpermanent fog of war\u201d on its own turf.\u201cWe are reeling from the tsunami of lies and the images of outrage,\u201d Evans, 92, writes in an email from his home in the Hamptons. \u201cWhat has been inspiring to see is that Americans have cut through the mist to fight for justice and equality.\u201dADADIs America failing, or is it just changing?\u201cI learned America was a failure when I was 18 and they tried to talk to me about the electoral college,\u201d says D.C. resident Allison Lane, 34. \u201cI\u2019ve always felt this country wasn\u2019t made for me.\u201dLane woke up Saturday at her home in Columbia Heights and saw on Twitter that Rep. John Lewis had died. Here was a man, she thought, who had every reason to give up on institutions, on this country, and yet he fought and fought and fought. It made her think of her own journey this year. In March, she lost her job at a new restaurant downtown. She kept it together until May, when George Floyd was killed, and then fell apart. Floyd looked like her uncle. It was all too much. She was depressed by her deferred career, grieving Floyd\u2019s death, paralyzed by the pandemic. Then June 1 she pulled herself outside and walked with friends to the White House. Police corralled the crowds uptown, until Lane found herself pepper-sprayed and seeking shelter from officers, with dozens of other wheezing activists, in a stranger\u2019s home on Swann Street NW, in a pandemic.\u201cAnd my entire life changed,\u201d says Lane, who in the aftermath launched a nonprofit called Bartenders Against Racism. \u201cI\u2019ve operated in anger over this past month, but it wasn\u2019t that same old anger, where old Allison Lane would be like \u2018F--- all this.\u2019 It was: \u2018Let me organize my community.\u2019 And I think I\u2019m so emotional with John Lewis because that\u2019s what he did with his entire life.\u201dSo she is remaking a small part of this country, the country that wasn\u2019t made for her, into her own. Bartenders Against Racism is amplifying black voices and providing supplies and sustenance to protesters. On Saturday night, Lane and others lit 300 tea candles spread over Black Lives Matter Plaza, the stretch of 16th Street NW leading to the White House, in a vigil for John Lewis. It was like lighting a path to freedom, she thought, to a better America.A union of states, or a nation of people?American collapse, or American transformation?Lane talks of her new life of activism as an experiment. She might as well be talking about the country.\u201cI tell the team: I\u2019m failing literally every day,\u201d she says. \u201cEvery day I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing. That doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m not smart or won\u2019t figure it out.\u201d\n\n", "comment": "1.4k Comments", "topic": "Style"}, {"cover": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/J4AK3YGG7MI6VKBFQ4RAATSBKA.jpghttps://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/J4AK3YGG7MI6VKBFQ4RAATSBKA.jpg", "title": "I\u2019m a GOP governor.

Then the killing of George Floyd, a Black American, by a White Minneapolis police officer in May sparked renewed focus on the global debate about the causes of the world\u2019s searing inequalities, why they\u2019ve been tolerated for so long and what can be done to reduce them.Support our journalism. Subscribe today.arrow-right1. What did the pandemic reveal?Densely populated poor and minority areas emerged as coronavirus hot spots and suffered disproportionate deaths in hard-hit countries including the U.S., the U.K. and Brazil. While the well-off hibernated in home offices and vacation properties, the essential workers who stock grocery store shelves and staff nursing homes continued to risk their lives on the front lines. Low-wage workers were hit disproportionately hard by job cuts. In the U.S., where unemployment reached the highest since the Great Depression era, pictures of snaking lines at food banks went viral. This all served as a backdrop to Floyd\u2019s death, which touched off the biggest civil rights movement in the U.S. since the 1960s and protests around the world.ADAD2. How did the world respond?Rich countries mobilized trillions of dollars of pandemic relief for their citizens, while poorer countries in Latin America and Africa struggled to cobble together aid. Governments stepped in to shore up safety nets and health systems. European companies flocked to government programs that kept millions of workers on the payroll for several months. The U.S. government stepped in to provide more robust benefits than ever before, including stimulus checks for households and previously unheard-of provisions such as tax credits for paid sick leave and unemployment insurance for gig workers. Vigorous debates erupted about how rescue funds were being channeled and whether they might \u2014 as was widely perceived after the 2008 financial crisis \u2014 bail out Wall Street at the expense of Main Street.3. Will the crisis widen inequality?ADADIt\u2019s looking that way. The World Bank warned that the pandemic could reverse years of progress for the poor in less-developed nations such as India and Nigeria, with as many as 100 million more people expected to fall into extreme poverty. Almost 40% of U.S. job losses were falling on those making less than $40,000, according to Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, who warned that long-term joblessness could be a drag the economy. What\u2019s more, when Black Americans \u2014 who are twice as likely to live in poverty \u2014 lost jobs they regained them more slowly than Whites. The dichotomy even jarred the investor class in June as the U.S. stock market, aided by the Fed\u2019s relief efforts, surged higher during the same weeks that the Black Lives Matter protests convulsed the nation.4. What exactly is meant by inequality?The term has evolved into a catchall for various related ills including poverty, wage stagnation, class division and social disorder. Over the last few years, populist leaders have won office in Italy, Mexico, the U.S. and elsewhere by, in part, tapping into anxieties among people who see the economy as stacked against them. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the elite club of 37 mostly rich countries, says inequality within its member nations is at the highest level in 50 years. The richest 1% earn, on average, nine times the income of the poorest 10%. The world\u2019s billionaires have more than twice the wealth of the rest of humanity combined, a 2019 Oxfam report found.ADAD5. Could the pandemic change things?Catastrophic events such as the pandemic have historically been a catalyst for reshuffling the economic order. During the Great Depression, with the New Deal, American workers gained a safety net. After World War II they won leverage with employers and higher pay.6. Isn\u2019t inequality just part of capitalism?Yes. Capitalism\u2019s profit motive provides incentives for people to act and take risks, which inevitably produces winners and losers. But French economist Thomas Piketty, who ignited academic study with his 2013 book \u201cCapital in the Twenty-First Century,\u201d sees discussions about reviving the post-pandemic economy as an opportunity to \u201cchange the dominant ideology in terms of how you deal with inequality and how you regulate the economy.\u201dADThe Search for SolutionsADTax the rich (more)\u2022 In the U.S., the Democratic Party, pulled to the left by its invigorated progressive wing, is percolating with proposals to tax the assets, income, inheritances or financial transactions of the affluent. Former Vice President Joe Biden, the party\u2019s presumptive nominee to run against President Donald Trump in the Nov. 3 election, wants to restore the top tax rate to 39.6%, its level before Trump\u2019s 2017 tax cuts dropped it to 37%. Biden also would double the levy on capital gains to 39.6% for taxpayers earning more than $1 million annually. There\u2019s also a global consensus around the need to shutter tax havens. Meanwhile, the pandemic has accelerated plans in several countries to raise revenue through a new \u201cdigital tax\u201d on the local sales of rich U.S. companies such as Facebook, Google and Netflix.ADCount headsAD\u2022 Efforts to hire, retain and promote minorities have largely failed to get more underrepresented groups into the highest-paying jobs. Quotas \u2014 or preset numerical targets \u2014 have a proven track record in Norway and California for getting more women on corporate boards, though the idea raises hackles even with metrics-obsessed executives. Still, with many companies reframing their thinking on inequality, several rolled out hiring targets or tied executive pay to hitting diversity goals. German sportswear brand Adidas AG promised that at least 30% of new U.S. hires would be Black or Latino. BlackRock Inc. committed to increasing its Black workforce 30% by 2024 and doubling the portion of senior leaders from its current 3% share. There are also calls to force more companies to disclose data on the racial and gender makeup of their workforce.Pay for past wrongsAD\u2022 Global protests against racism have renewed calls to pay reparations to correct legacy wrongdoings. In the U.K., centuries-old institutions have acknowledged their connections to Britain\u2019s slave trade, with insurer Lloyd\u2019s of London pledging in June to donate an unspecified amount to charities promoting opportunities for Black and minority groups. Proposals to compensate African Americans for the shackles of slavery reach into the trillions of dollars. Interim steps might include federally funded trust funds for Black children that could be tapped in adulthood to pay for education, start a business or purchase a home. In a 2019 Gallup poll, only 29% of Americans supported the idea of paying the descendants of slaves, but that number was up from 14% in 2002.ADReconsider the role of central banks\u2022 In the U.S. and elsewhere, central bankers face questions about how their policies might be disproportionately helping the rich. Even in the strong pre-pandemic economy, minorities struggled to make meaningful progress toward closing gaps in employment, earnings and wealth. Central bankers are considering whether a more relaxed approach to inflation could help narrow labor-market disparities. While Fed officials stress that monetary policy has a limited ability to target things like Black unemployment, they\u2019re pressing lawmakers more openly for government spending and other steps to help ease inequality.ADLighten the load on poorer countries\u2022 More than 100 nations staring down the humanitarian and economic shocks of the pandemic have asked the International Monetary Fund for help. Global leaders backed a moratorium on foreign debt payments for some of the world\u2019s poorest countries to the end of the year; some $730 billion was scheduled to come due this year. Countries including Angola and Pakistan have requested relief. China said it would help African nations facing \u201cthe greatest strain.\u201d Ultimately there may need to be a broad program to help poorer countries restructure their loans, similar to the Brady Plan of the late 1980s.ADStrengthen unions and boost wagesAD\u2022 The plight of essential workers during the pandemic drew attention to the lack of labor protections and low pay for those who keep society running. Some front-line workers in the U.S. began organizing and agitating for more rights, with walk-outs at Amazon, grocery delivery service Instacart and meat processor Perdue Farms. One possible answer is stronger unions. Many countries are seeing a push for employers to pay a \u201cliving wage\u201d that lifts workers out of poverty. Economists are also studying how a higher concentration of big companies in some industries has eroded the bargaining power of workers, and how breakups of dominant firms might help address that.Provide a universal basic income\u2022 With automation raising fears about how robots might eliminate jobs, politicians and business leaders have floated the idea of a stipend for every citizen, also known as universal basic income. Former U.S. presidential candidate and entrepreneur Andrew Yang made it the central pillar of his platform, calling for a $1,000-a-month \u201cfreedom dividend\u201d for every American adult. Cities around the world that have experimented with the idea have had modest success. Finland ended a two-year trial run in 2018 with little fanfare, but preliminary findings showed that the monthly payments improved well-being for participants. The mayor of Stockton, California, which began giving 125 residents $500 a month in February 2019, is trying to expand the idea with a movement called Mayors for a Guaranteed Income.ADReform capitalism\u2022 So-called stakeholder capitalism demands that companies balance the interests of shareholders with those of employees, customers and society. In August 2019, Business Roundtable, an association of U.S. chief executive officers, endorsed the idea. In Europe, company goals have traditionally been closer to that view, with Germany requiring 50% employee representation on large corporations\u2019 supervisory boards, which make strategic decisions. Another model is Scandinavia, which uses high taxes to offset inequality. Governments can also expand targeted programs to address areas where the capitalist system falls short of societal needs, such as building affordable housing.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P.", "comment": "0 Comments", "topic": "Business"}, {"cover": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/IRBKUBGAJMI6VCIINCRLT2XJ4A.jpghttps://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/IRBKUBGAJMI6VCIINCRLT2XJ4A.jpg", "title": "The Daily 202: Some U.S. health officials lament a coronavirus crisis that didn't need to happen", "date": "Jul 8, 2020", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/daily-202/2020/07/08/daily-202-some-u-s-health-officials-lament-a-coronavirus-crisis-that-didn-t-need-to-happen/5f04d82e602ff10807196d65/", "keyword": "China and the world order", "website": "the Washington Post", "author": "Chelsea Janes", "content": "with Mariana AlfaroNote to readers: James Hohmann is on vacation until July 20.

Subscribe today.arrow-rightIn late May, former World Bank president Jim Yong Kim, an American who has served in Democratic and Republican administrations, waxed incredulous at the lack of a coordinated U.S. strategy\u00a0aimed at combating the novel coronavirus.Kim was making an opening statement during an online roundtable with public health experts from academia, local U.S. health departments and hospital systems about tried-and-true infection containment strategies like testing, contact tracing and isolation, which have been employed effectively in other countries.AD\u00a0\u201cThe thing that\u2019s been driving me crazy is that we\u2019ve just decided that the standard health response \u2014 the only thing that\u2019s worked in any of the countries that suppressed the virus \u2014 is something that we\u2019re just not going to do,\u201d said Kim, who headed the World Health Organization\u2019s HIV response during the second George W. Bush administration and led the World Bank for parts of the Obama and Trump administrations.ADSara Cody, head of the public health department in California's Santa Clara County, known now for orchestrating one of the country\u2019s earliest coronavirus shutdowns, was also on the call. She seemed relieved to hear him say so.\u201cI begin to feel like, am I the one that\u2019s not thinking straight? It feels a little lonely,\u201d Cody said then.ADCody is not alone among U.S. health officials, epidemiologists, virologists and other experts in feeling like she missed the memo saying the world\u2019s richest nation really couldn\u2019t do much to keep this virus from paralyzing it. Many local officials are still asking the same question Kim posed that day: \u201cWhy have we given up on containment?\u201d \u00a0The pressing question is whether political officials have the will to employ reliable measures to curtail the virus.So far, that political will has been largely lacking, from President Trump down to many state and local officials trying to limit the virus's spread without destroying the economy. The country as a whole sets a new high in cases almost every day. The virus is spreading unchecked in states as distant geographically and ideologically as California and Alabama. Arizona has diagnosed more cases per capita than any European country.ADADA new influential model released Tuesday from the University of Washington's Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation predicts 208,255 American deaths by Nov. 1 if no further mitigation efforts are enforced. If mask use becomes widespread, then those projected deaths would drop to 162,807 people.\u201cThe key is we did not have to be here right now,\u201d Leana Wen, a Washington Post contributing columnist and former Baltimore health commissioner and head of Planned Parenthood, told CNN. Wen argued that if the United States employs effective containment measure \u2014 including social distancing and mask wearing \u2014 \u201cthat 200,000 number doesn't have to be inevitable.\u201dAnthony S. Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergies and Infectious Diseases, said Monday that the country is still experiencing the beginning stages of the pandemic.\u201cWe are still knee-deep in the first wave of this, and I would say this would not be considered a wave \u2014 this is a surge and resurgence of infections, superimposed on a baseline that never got down where we wanted to go,\u201d Fauci said.That only hardened the notion of inevitability \u2014 cementing the feeling that the virus would have spread no matter what.\u00a0The Trump administration isn't aggressively messaging around or clamping down on the virus, as the president has violated recommendations from his own health officials to wear a mask in public, not to attend crowded gatherings and to distance from others. Indeed, the Trump administration seems bent on getting Americans to forget about the contagion, even as cases surge in some states.ADAD\u201cWhite House officials also hope Americans will grow numb to the escalating death toll and learn to accept tens of thousands of new cases a day, according to three people familiar with the White House\u2019s thinking, who requested anonymity to reveal internal deliberations. Americans will \u2018live with the virus being a threat,\u2019 in the words of one of those people, a senior administration official,\" according to my colleagues Yasmeen Abutaleb and Josh Dawsey.But\u00a0the virus didn\u2019t have to become so widespread that officials aren't sure they will be able to offer full in-person teaching at American schools in the fall, although Trump is pressuring state and local officials to do so. Just look at other places like Taiwan, South Korea and Hong Kong that have successfully contained the virus.\u00a0The United States, experts say, was not doomed to lose control.\u201cOther countries have taken it seriously, and we have not,\u201d said Ashish Jha, director of the Global Health Institute at Harvard University. \u201cOther [countries] have had a very aggressive shutdown. We have not. Other countries have taken an aggressive approach to testing and tracing and isolation. We have not. Some countries have universal masking laws, and we don\u2019t.\u201dADADKim led the HIV response in Haiti. He oversaw implementation of contact tracing for Ebola in Liberia and Sierra Leone. Still, he said the coronavirus pandemic in the United States is still one of the most difficult public health challenges he has ever encountered, in part because of a convoluted health insurance system and political dysfunction.Certainly, the effort required to contain the virus in the United States sooner would have qualified as Herculean \u2014 adjusted upward for 3,000 years or so of inflation. But there were a host of missed opportunities, from not recognizing the threat early enough, to a botched testing strategy rolled out by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, to a patchwork of erratic orders from states and not the central government.Containment would have required coordinated mobilization of federal and state resources to acquire or manufacture enough personal protective equipment and testing supplies to avoid shortages if at all possible. It would have required outfitting a nation of long understaffed and underfunded health departments. It would have required a cohesive public messaging campaign strong enough to unify to a divided nation behind the common cause of eradicating the virus before hundreds of thousands could die from it.But containment was not impossible here.After the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa, experts from the nonprofit Nuclear Threat Initiative and Johns Hopkins University partnered with the Economist Intelligence Unit and philanthropic groups to develop a Global Health Security Index measuring countries\u2019 readiness to combat dangerous outbreaks based on the answers publicly available data yielded to 140 questions across six categories. In a report published in 2019, the United States ranked as the most prepared country overall.ADAD\u201cOne of the things they didn\u2019t think about was political inaction and political ineptitude,\u201d Jha said of that report, echoing other experts who say the United States has lacked the \u201cpolitical will\u201d to meet the covid-19 moment.Local officials and nationally visible epidemiologists alike say that when federal and state officials downplayed the public health threat posed by the virus, they undermined the sense of urgency necessary to mobilize a country of this size and keep it focused on the problem.As with most public health responses, success is not usually measured in what does happen but what doesn\u2019t. In this case, success would be measured in people not suffering and dying from a virus they needn\u2019t have been exposed to in the first place. Beating the virus, therefore, would feel significant only in hindsight and by comparison, when what could have been is juxtaposed with what was.ADADFighting a pandemic, therefore, requires commitment to consistency and delayed gratification \u2014 something public health experts like Kim and Jha say federal leadership has not modeled for the public. Each day now costs the country more than 500 lives. The country no longer has weeks to prepare testing, tracing and isolation strategies. Our nationwide public health infrastructure cannot fit into a few panicked weeks what it needed to do over months.So far, the cost of American apathy has been 128,566 lives in the United States in four months \u2014 or a fourth of what the country lost to World War II in three and a half years.In the meantime, local officials who haven\u2019t given up on containment are being forced to lead the massive undertaking themselves, knowing that whatever they achieve in their own jurisdictions, they can't control what happens in the next county over. Some have been rewarded with criticism and even death threats from those who believe their efforts cratered the economy or are imposing on individual freedoms.ADADHealth departments from Louisville to Portland, Ore., to Sauk County, Wis., are trying to hire more staff on the fly \u2014 in some cases more than doubling the size of their departments \u2014 so they will also have enough staff to trace cases, assuming they have the testing supplies to identify them in the first place.\u00a0Mayors are begging citizens to wear masks, even as their state governments won\u2019t mandate them. A country\u2019s worth of local officials with tired arms is holding tiny umbrellas they must patch as they go, hoping it will prevent their localities from being inundated with the virus.\u00a0So far, it isn\u2019t really working.\u201cThe current state is really not good,\u201d Fauci said. \u201c \u2026 We went up, never came down to baseline, and now are surging back up. It\u2019s a serious situation we have to address immediately.\u201dMore on the coronavirusFlorida invited the nation to its reopening. Then it became the nation's new coronavirus epicenter.\u00a0\u201cNearly 1 out of every 100 residents is infected with the virus, hospital intensive care units are full or filling up, and big-name visitors who chose Florida for their first post-isolation events are now mired in questions and controversies about safety. Amid escalating infections, Florida, once held up by Trump as a model for how to manage the novel coronavirus, is faring poorly. Residents worry the situation will get much worse,\u201d Cleve R. Wootson Jr., Isaac Stanley-Becker and Lori Rozsa report. \u201cOn Tuesday there were 213,794 cases of the coronavirus in Florida, according to Post data. \u2026 52 intensive care units across more than a third of the state\u2019s counties had reached capacity\u2026\u00a0AD\u201cHospital leaders, lawmakers, physicians, epidemiologists, advocates and others familiar with the state\u2019s response said a false sense of security set in when grim predictions about the virus\u2019s spread in Florida did not come to pass in March and April. \u2026 \u00a0Sports leagues that opted to restart their seasons in Florida will now play in a state that is in worse shape than when the pandemic began. \u2026 The Republican National Convention, scheduled to take place in Jacksonville next month, faces similar questions about safety \u2026 Several hundred doctors have signed a petition that says the convention needs stronger safety measures \u2026 Disney World has announced it would begin to allow visitors back into the Magic Kingdom this week. \u2026\u00a0\u201cThere has been a rise in cases affecting older Floridians as well as those living in nursing homes and other long-term care facilities \u2026 Testing sites across the state are seeing shortages, and the wait time for results is now as long as 10 days \u2026 There were also acute shortages of the antiviral drug remdesivir in parts of the state, causing Democratic members of Florida\u2019s congressional delegation to send a letter Tuesday to HHS Alex Azar asking him to speed the shipment of emergency supplies. \u2026 Amid the array of old and new concerns, teachers across Florida learned they would have to begin preparing their classrooms for an influx of students. \u2026 \u2018I\u2019ve spoken with a lot of my teacher friends, and a lot of them don\u2019t want to go back,\u2019 [first-grade teacher Cara Conlogue said]. \u2018We love our students, we miss them, and we love our jobs. But we don\u2019t feel safe.\u2019\u201dAs the virus spreads and hospitalizations rise, it\u2019s America vs. the world.\u201cTrump pitted America against the world [by] moving to pull the United States out of the WHO while his FBI director accused China of hacking U.S. health-care companies that are researching the novel coronavirus,\u201d Joshua Partlow reports. \u201c\u2018At this very moment, China is working to compromise American health-care organizations, pharmaceutical companies and academic institutions conducting essential covid research,\u2019 [FBI Director Christopher] Wray said in remarks at the Hudson Institute...\u00a0\"His remarks came as cases and hospitalizations in the United States continued to mount \u2026 Arizona reported 117 deaths on Tuesday, a daily record for the state, as more than 3,000 people were being treated in hospitals and ICU beds neared capacity. Texas canceled its annual state fair, the longest-running fair in the country, as more than 8,000 Texans were hospitalized on Monday, a third higher than last week. Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine (R) issued an order Tuesday requiring residents to wear masks in public in seven counties, including those that are home to Cincinnati and Cleveland. \u2026 More than 890 U.S. deaths were reported Tuesday, the highest total in 12 days, amid signs the country\u2019s death rate might be creeping up after falling for the past three months.\u00a0\"Trump has repeatedly complained that not enough attention is being paid to the country\u2019s death rate. ... Scientists say many countries have lower death rates than the United States. \u2026 Anthony S. Fauci, said that although the fatality rate of the coronavirus has dropped, Americans should not be complacent. \u2018It\u2019s a false narrative to take comfort in a lower rate of death,' Fauci [said] \u2026 The lower mortality rate is a result of two factors, he said. The country has gotten better at treating people, particularly through therapies that work in the advanced stages of the disease. And, Fauci said, the mean age of those getting infected has dropped by about 15 years.\u201dTrump\u2019s new visa rules are seen as a way to pressure colleges into reopening.\u201cA directive by the Trump administration that would strip international college students of their U.S. visas if their coursework was entirely online prompted widespread confusion on Tuesday as students scrambled to clarify their statuses and universities reassessed their fall reopening policies amid the coronavirus pandemic,\u201d the Times reports. \u201cThe effect may be to dramatically reduce the number of international students enrolling in the fall. Together with delays in processing visas as a result of the pandemic, immigrant advocates say the new rules, which must still be finalized this month, might discourage many overseas students from attending American universities, where they often pay full tuition. \u2026 Although higher education officials saw the move by the Trump administration as an attempt to force their hands on reopening, which Trump has pushed for, the directive also holds appeal to groups that favor reducing legal immigration to the United States.\u201d\u00a0Southeastern Veterans\u2019 Center, a Pennsylvania nursing home, gave some veterans hydroxychloroquine even without testing them for the coronavirus in what nurses referred to as the \u201ccovid cocktail.\u201d There is no way to know whether the treatment played a role in any deaths at the home, which has attributed 42 fatalities to covid-19.

(NYT)The Trump presidencyTrump\u2019s attacks on mail voting are turning Republicans off absentee ballots.\u00a0The dynamic is alarming \u201cRepublican strategists, who say it could undercut their own candidates, including Trump himself,\u201d Amy Gardner and Josh Dawsey report. \u201cIn several primaries this spring, Democratic voters have embraced mail ballots in far larger numbers than Republicans during a campaign season defined by the pandemic. And when they urge their supporters to vote by mail, GOP campaigns around the country are hearing from more and more Republican voters who say they do not trust absentee ballots, according to multiple strategists. \u2026 The growing Republican antagonism toward voting by mail comes even as the Trump campaign is launching a major absentee-ballot program in every competitive state, according to multiple campaign advisers \u2013 a delicate balancing act \u2026 The president, however, has been arguing the opposite. Nearly daily in recent weeks and usually on Twitter, Trump has attacked mail balloting, leveling many unsubstantiated allegations.\"In a new guidance, the CDC is recommending that voters consider alternatives to casting their ballots in person.\u00a0\u201cThe guidance was issued with little fanfare on June 22 and suggested that state and local election officials take steps to minimize crowds at voting locations, including offering \u2018alternative voting methods,\u2019\u201d Michelle Ye Hee Lee reports. \u201cVoters who want to cast ballots in person should consider showing up at off-peak times, bringing their own black ink pens or touch-screen pens for voting machines, and washing their hands before entering and after leaving the polling location, the guidance said. Workers and voters alike, it said, should wear face coverings.\u201d \u00a0At least five Republican lawmakers are not going to the Jacksonville convention.\u201cSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), 78, indicated Tuesday he will attend the convention, but two other top Senate Republicans, Iowa\u2019s Charles E. Grassley, 86, and Tennessee\u2019s Lamar Alexander, 80, are taking a pass,\u201d Michael Scherer and Josh Dawsey report. \u201cMaine\u2019s Susan Collins, 67, said though a spokesman that she avoids attending the party convention in years when she is facing reelection. Alaska\u2019s Lisa Murkowski, 63, also has no plans to attend, according to a spokesperson, nor does Utah\u2019s Mitt Romney, 73. Collins, Murkowski and Romney have criticized Trump on occasion, making their presence potentially uncomfortable at an event that will largely be a tribute to the president. But Grassley made it clear his decision is motivated solely by fear of contracting the coronavirus. \u2026\u00a0\u201cTrump himself signaled Tuesday some flexibility regarding the convention. \u2018When we signed a few weeks ago, it looked good. And now all of a sudden it\u2019s spiking up a little bit and that\u2019s going to go down,\u2019 the president told television host Greta Van Susteren. \u2018It really depends on the timing. .\u2009.\u2009. We can do a lot of things, but we\u2019re very flexible.\u2019\u2026 For some, going is a way to show their support for Trump. Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), 64, avoided the nominating convention in 2016 as part of his public rejection of Trump\u2019s candidacy \u2026 But the senator\u2019s spokesman \u2026 said Graham, who is facing a contested election in a Trump-friendly state, would be there this time. Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), 50, who is also looking to win another term in November, has signaled she plans to be in Jacksonville, as has Sen. Mike Braun (R-Ind.), 66, who credits Trump with helping him win election in 2018.\u201dNew Hampshire\u2019s Republican governor defended Trump\u2019s decision to hold a rally in the state, but he\u2019s not attending.\u00a0Gov. Chris Sununu assured reporters that Trump's rally in the state could be pulled off safely and without a mandatory mask order, CNN reports. Sununu said that he plans on greeting Trump at some point during his visit, but that it was unlikely that he\u2019d attend the rally, citing health concerns.\u00a0Biden criticized Trump\u2019s campaign for taking aim at Sen. Tammy Duckworth, one of his potential running mates.\u00a0\u201cSpeaking at a virtual fundraiser that Duckworth (D-Ill.) also attended, [Biden] said it was \u2018disgusting, sickening\u2019 of Trump\u2019s circle to question her patriotism and that it was a \u2018reflection of the depravity of what\u2019s going on in the White House right now,\u2019\u201d Sean Sullivan reports. On Sunday, Duckworth was asked on CNN about activists\u2019 demands that statues of George Washington be removed because he owned slaves. \u201cI think we should listen to everybody. I think we should listen to the argument there,\u201d she said. Fox News host Tucker Carlson then attacked Duckworth, calling her an \u201cunimpressive person\u201d and suggesting that she and other Democratic leaders \u201cactually hate America.\u201d Trump shared a clip from Carlson\u2019s show.\u00a0No Americans are known to have died in the reported Russian bounty operation.Marine Gen.

Russia has denied the existence of the arrangement.\u201d\u00a0McKenzie said he\u2019s confident that Iraqis will ask American troops to remain.\u00a0\"I believe the government of Iraq recognizes the true value that the coalition brings to the fight against Daesh (another name for ISIS) in Iraq, and I believe that going forward, they're going to want us to be with them,\" McKenzie said.

Trump, whose book is by turns a family history and a psychological analysis of her uncle,\u201d Shane Harris and Michael Kranish report. \u201cBut she writes that as Donald matured, his father came to envy his son\u2019s \u2018confidence and brazenness,\u2019 as well as his seemingly insatiable desire to flout rules and conventions, traits that brought them closer together as Donald became the right-hand man in the family real estate business.\u201dA book by NBC\u2019s Jacob Soboroff quotes top Pence aide Katie Miller questioning immigrant-heavy neighborhoods.\u00a0Miller, a Florida native, singled out Miami\u2019s Little Havana. \u201cI believe that if you come to America, you should assimilate,\u201d Miller said, per Soboroff. \u201cWhy do we need to have Little Havana?\u201d The comments drew ire from Republicans, since older Cuban American voters in Miami are a key part of Trump\u2019s strategy to win Florida in 2020.

National Guard and Arlington County police, is now under investigation by Congress and the inspectors general of the Interior Department and Justice Department and the subject of civil lawsuits,\u201d Tom Jackman reports. \u201cWhen investigators review a police operation, they typically rely on audio and video recordings made by police to verify accounts made in statements or interviews. But the Park Police, along with nearly all federal uniformed police, have never worn body cameras. Officers and commanders said they expected that their comments and orders made during the operation would be captured electronically, to create a contemporaneous record of the event. But that didn\u2019t happen. \u2018At the conclusion of the demonstrations,\u2019 Park Police Lt. Jonathan Hofflinger said, \u2018we discovered that the radio recorder was not working and did not record any transmissions. However, written radio logs were generated as a redundant practice.

Grant \u2014 prompting a Twitter storm from Trump and outrage from those who see the felling of the statues as an attack on American history. The monuments have also ignited debate among the protesters themselves over where to draw the line on historical figures that some say are too morally compromised to be venerated,\u201d Annie Gowen reports. \u201cThe demonstrators\u2019 views range from support for removal of all monuments to an embrace slow-paced community discussion and historical review. \u2026 For some demonstrators, it\u2019s not the image of a particular president that is important, but how the leader is portrayed.\u201d\u00a0Christopher Columbus symbols are falling across the country.

Subscribe today.arrow-rightIn late May, former World Bank president Jim Yong Kim, an American who has served in Democratic and Republican administrations, waxed incredulous at the lack of a coordinated U.S. strategy\u00a0aimed at combating the novel coronavirus.Kim was making an opening statement during an online roundtable with public health experts from academia, local U.S. health departments and hospital systems about tried-and-true infection containment strategies like testing, contact tracing and isolation, which have been employed effectively in other countries.AD\u00a0\u201cThe thing that\u2019s been driving me crazy is that we\u2019ve just decided that the standard health response \u2014 the only thing that\u2019s worked in any of the countries that suppressed the virus \u2014 is something that we\u2019re just not going to do,\u201d said Kim, who headed the World Health Organization\u2019s HIV response during the second George W. Bush administration and led the World Bank for parts of the Obama and Trump administrations.ADSara Cody, head of the public health department in California's Santa Clara County, known now for orchestrating one of the country\u2019s earliest coronavirus shutdowns, was also on the call. She seemed relieved to hear him say so.\u201cI begin to feel like, am I the one that\u2019s not thinking straight? It feels a little lonely,\u201d Cody said then.ADCody is not alone among U.S. health officials, epidemiologists, virologists and other experts in feeling like she missed the memo saying the world\u2019s richest nation really couldn\u2019t do much to keep this virus from paralyzing it. Many local officials are still asking the same question Kim posed that day: \u201cWhy have we given up on containment?\u201d \u00a0The pressing question is whether political officials have the will to employ reliable measures to curtail the virus.So far, that political will has been largely lacking, from President Trump down to many state and local officials trying to limit the virus's spread without destroying the economy. The country as a whole sets a new high in cases almost every day. The virus is spreading unchecked in states as distant geographically and ideologically as California and Alabama. Arizona has diagnosed more cases per capita than any European country.ADADA new influential model released Tuesday from the University of Washington's Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation predicts 208,255 American deaths by Nov. 1 if no further mitigation efforts are enforced. If mask use becomes widespread, then those projected deaths would drop to 162,807 people.\u201cThe key is we did not have to be here right now,\u201d Leana Wen, a Washington Post contributing columnist and former Baltimore health commissioner and head of Planned Parenthood, told CNN. Wen argued that if the United States employs effective containment measure \u2014 including social distancing and mask wearing \u2014 \u201cthat 200,000 number doesn't have to be inevitable.\u201dAnthony S. Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergies and Infectious Diseases, said Monday that the country is still experiencing the beginning stages of the pandemic.\u201cWe are still knee-deep in the first wave of this, and I would say this would not be considered a wave \u2014 this is a surge and resurgence of infections, superimposed on a baseline that never got down where we wanted to go,\u201d Fauci said.That only hardened the notion of inevitability \u2014 cementing the feeling that the virus would have spread no matter what.\u00a0The Trump administration isn't aggressively messaging around or clamping down on the virus, as the president has violated recommendations from his own health officials to wear a mask in public, not to attend crowded gatherings and to distance from others. Indeed, the Trump administration seems bent on getting Americans to forget about the contagion, even as cases surge in some states.ADAD\u201cWhite House officials also hope Americans will grow numb to the escalating death toll and learn to accept tens of thousands of new cases a day, according to three people familiar with the White House\u2019s thinking, who requested anonymity to reveal internal deliberations. Americans will \u2018live with the virus being a threat,\u2019 in the words of one of those people, a senior administration official,\" according to my colleagues Yasmeen Abutaleb and Josh Dawsey.But\u00a0the virus didn\u2019t have to become so widespread that officials aren't sure they will be able to offer full in-person teaching at American schools in the fall, although Trump is pressuring state and local officials to do so. Just look at other places like Taiwan, South Korea and Hong Kong that have successfully contained the virus.\u00a0The United States, experts say, was not doomed to lose control.\u201cOther countries have taken it seriously, and we have not,\u201d said Ashish Jha, director of the Global Health Institute at Harvard University. \u201cOther [countries] have had a very aggressive shutdown. We have not. Other countries have taken an aggressive approach to testing and tracing and isolation. We have not. Some countries have universal masking laws, and we don\u2019t.\u201dADADKim led the HIV response in Haiti. He oversaw implementation of contact tracing for Ebola in Liberia and Sierra Leone. Still, he said the coronavirus pandemic in the United States is still one of the most difficult public health challenges he has ever encountered, in part because of a convoluted health insurance system and political dysfunction.Certainly, the effort required to contain the virus in the United States sooner would have qualified as Herculean \u2014 adjusted upward for 3,000 years or so of inflation. But there were a host of missed opportunities, from not recognizing the threat early enough, to a botched testing strategy rolled out by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, to a patchwork of erratic orders from states and not the central government.Containment would have required coordinated mobilization of federal and state resources to acquire or manufacture enough personal protective equipment and testing supplies to avoid shortages if at all possible. It would have required outfitting a nation of long understaffed and underfunded health departments. It would have required a cohesive public messaging campaign strong enough to unify to a divided nation behind the common cause of eradicating the virus before hundreds of thousands could die from it.But containment was not impossible here.After the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa, experts from the nonprofit Nuclear Threat Initiative and Johns Hopkins University partnered with the Economist Intelligence Unit and philanthropic groups to develop a Global Health Security Index measuring countries\u2019 readiness to combat dangerous outbreaks based on the answers publicly available data yielded to 140 questions across six categories. In a report published in 2019, the United States ranked as the most prepared country overall.ADAD\u201cOne of the things they didn\u2019t think about was political inaction and political ineptitude,\u201d Jha said of that report, echoing other experts who say the United States has lacked the \u201cpolitical will\u201d to meet the covid-19 moment.Local officials and nationally visible epidemiologists alike say that when federal and state officials downplayed the public health threat posed by the virus, they undermined the sense of urgency necessary to mobilize a country of this size and keep it focused on the problem.As with most public health responses, success is not usually measured in what does happen but what doesn\u2019t. In this case, success would be measured in people not suffering and dying from a virus they needn\u2019t have been exposed to in the first place. Beating the virus, therefore, would feel significant only in hindsight and by comparison, when what could have been is juxtaposed with what was.ADADFighting a pandemic, therefore, requires commitment to consistency and delayed gratification \u2014 something public health experts like Kim and Jha say federal leadership has not modeled for the public. Each day now costs the country more than 500 lives. The country no longer has weeks to prepare testing, tracing and isolation strategies. Our nationwide public health infrastructure cannot fit into a few panicked weeks what it needed to do over months.So far, the cost of American apathy has been 128,566 lives in the United States in four months \u2014 or a fourth of what the country lost to World War II in three and a half years.In the meantime, local officials who haven\u2019t given up on containment are being forced to lead the massive undertaking themselves, knowing that whatever they achieve in their own jurisdictions, they can't control what happens in the next county over. Some have been rewarded with criticism and even death threats from those who believe their efforts cratered the economy or are imposing on individual freedoms.ADADHealth departments from Louisville to Portland, Ore., to Sauk County, Wis., are trying to hire more staff on the fly \u2014 in some cases more than doubling the size of their departments \u2014 so they will also have enough staff to trace cases, assuming they have the testing supplies to identify them in the first place.\u00a0Mayors are begging citizens to wear masks, even as their state governments won\u2019t mandate them. A country\u2019s worth of local officials with tired arms is holding tiny umbrellas they must patch as they go, hoping it will prevent their localities from being inundated with the virus.\u00a0So far, it isn\u2019t really working.\u201cThe current state is really not good,\u201d Fauci said. \u201c \u2026 We went up, never came down to baseline, and now are surging back up. It\u2019s a serious situation we have to address immediately.\u201dMore on the coronavirusFlorida invited the nation to its reopening. Then it became the nation's new coronavirus epicenter.\u00a0\u201cNearly 1 out of every 100 residents is infected with the virus, hospital intensive care units are full or filling up, and big-name visitors who chose Florida for their first post-isolation events are now mired in questions and controversies about safety. Amid escalating infections, Florida, once held up by Trump as a model for how to manage the novel coronavirus, is faring poorly. Residents worry the situation will get much worse,\u201d Cleve R. Wootson Jr., Isaac Stanley-Becker and Lori Rozsa report. \u201cOn Tuesday there were 213,794 cases of the coronavirus in Florida, according to Post data. \u2026 52 intensive care units across more than a third of the state\u2019s counties had reached capacity\u2026\u00a0AD\u201cHospital leaders, lawmakers, physicians, epidemiologists, advocates and others familiar with the state\u2019s response said a false sense of security set in when grim predictions about the virus\u2019s spread in Florida did not come to pass in March and April. \u2026 \u00a0Sports leagues that opted to restart their seasons in Florida will now play in a state that is in worse shape than when the pandemic began. \u2026 The Republican National Convention, scheduled to take place in Jacksonville next month, faces similar questions about safety \u2026 Several hundred doctors have signed a petition that says the convention needs stronger safety measures \u2026 Disney World has announced it would begin to allow visitors back into the Magic Kingdom this week. \u2026\u00a0\u201cThere has been a rise in cases affecting older Floridians as well as those living in nursing homes and other long-term care facilities \u2026 Testing sites across the state are seeing shortages, and the wait time for results is now as long as 10 days \u2026 There were also acute shortages of the antiviral drug remdesivir in parts of the state, causing Democratic members of Florida\u2019s congressional delegation to send a letter Tuesday to HHS Alex Azar asking him to speed the shipment of emergency supplies. \u2026 Amid the array of old and new concerns, teachers across Florida learned they would have to begin preparing their classrooms for an influx of students. \u2026 \u2018I\u2019ve spoken with a lot of my teacher friends, and a lot of them don\u2019t want to go back,\u2019 [first-grade teacher Cara Conlogue said]. \u2018We love our students, we miss them, and we love our jobs. But we don\u2019t feel safe.\u2019\u201dAs the virus spreads and hospitalizations rise, it\u2019s America vs. the world.\u201cTrump pitted America against the world [by] moving to pull the United States out of the WHO while his FBI director accused China of hacking U.S. health-care companies that are researching the novel coronavirus,\u201d Joshua Partlow reports. \u201c\u2018At this very moment, China is working to compromise American health-care organizations, pharmaceutical companies and academic institutions conducting essential covid research,\u2019 [FBI Director Christopher] Wray said in remarks at the Hudson Institute...\u00a0\"His remarks came as cases and hospitalizations in the United States continued to mount \u2026 Arizona reported 117 deaths on Tuesday, a daily record for the state, as more than 3,000 people were being treated in hospitals and ICU beds neared capacity. Texas canceled its annual state fair, the longest-running fair in the country, as more than 8,000 Texans were hospitalized on Monday, a third higher than last week. Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine (R) issued an order Tuesday requiring residents to wear masks in public in seven counties, including those that are home to Cincinnati and Cleveland. \u2026 More than 890 U.S. deaths were reported Tuesday, the highest total in 12 days, amid signs the country\u2019s death rate might be creeping up after falling for the past three months.\u00a0\"Trump has repeatedly complained that not enough attention is being paid to the country\u2019s death rate. ... Scientists say many countries have lower death rates than the United States. \u2026 Anthony S. Fauci, said that although the fatality rate of the coronavirus has dropped, Americans should not be complacent. \u2018It\u2019s a false narrative to take comfort in a lower rate of death,' Fauci [said] \u2026 The lower mortality rate is a result of two factors, he said. The country has gotten better at treating people, particularly through therapies that work in the advanced stages of the disease. And, Fauci said, the mean age of those getting infected has dropped by about 15 years.\u201dTrump\u2019s new visa rules are seen as a way to pressure colleges into reopening.\u201cA directive by the Trump administration that would strip international college students of their U.S. visas if their coursework was entirely online prompted widespread confusion on Tuesday as students scrambled to clarify their statuses and universities reassessed their fall reopening policies amid the coronavirus pandemic,\u201d the Times reports. \u201cThe effect may be to dramatically reduce the number of international students enrolling in the fall. Together with delays in processing visas as a result of the pandemic, immigrant advocates say the new rules, which must still be finalized this month, might discourage many overseas students from attending American universities, where they often pay full tuition. \u2026 Although higher education officials saw the move by the Trump administration as an attempt to force their hands on reopening, which Trump has pushed for, the directive also holds appeal to groups that favor reducing legal immigration to the United States.\u201d\u00a0Southeastern Veterans\u2019 Center, a Pennsylvania nursing home, gave some veterans hydroxychloroquine even without testing them for the coronavirus in what nurses referred to as the \u201ccovid cocktail.\u201d There is no way to know whether the treatment played a role in any deaths at the home, which has attributed 42 fatalities to covid-19.

(NYT)The Trump presidencyTrump\u2019s attacks on mail voting are turning Republicans off absentee ballots.\u00a0The dynamic is alarming \u201cRepublican strategists, who say it could undercut their own candidates, including Trump himself,\u201d Amy Gardner and Josh Dawsey report. \u201cIn several primaries this spring, Democratic voters have embraced mail ballots in far larger numbers than Republicans during a campaign season defined by the pandemic. And when they urge their supporters to vote by mail, GOP campaigns around the country are hearing from more and more Republican voters who say they do not trust absentee ballots, according to multiple strategists. \u2026 The growing Republican antagonism toward voting by mail comes even as the Trump campaign is launching a major absentee-ballot program in every competitive state, according to multiple campaign advisers \u2013 a delicate balancing act \u2026 The president, however, has been arguing the opposite. Nearly daily in recent weeks and usually on Twitter, Trump has attacked mail balloting, leveling many unsubstantiated allegations.\"In a new guidance, the CDC is recommending that voters consider alternatives to casting their ballots in person.\u00a0\u201cThe guidance was issued with little fanfare on June 22 and suggested that state and local election officials take steps to minimize crowds at voting locations, including offering \u2018alternative voting methods,\u2019\u201d Michelle Ye Hee Lee reports. \u201cVoters who want to cast ballots in person should consider showing up at off-peak times, bringing their own black ink pens or touch-screen pens for voting machines, and washing their hands before entering and after leaving the polling location, the guidance said. Workers and voters alike, it said, should wear face coverings.\u201d \u00a0At least five Republican lawmakers are not going to the Jacksonville convention.\u201cSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), 78, indicated Tuesday he will attend the convention, but two other top Senate Republicans, Iowa\u2019s Charles E. Grassley, 86, and Tennessee\u2019s Lamar Alexander, 80, are taking a pass,\u201d Michael Scherer and Josh Dawsey report. \u201cMaine\u2019s Susan Collins, 67, said though a spokesman that she avoids attending the party convention in years when she is facing reelection. Alaska\u2019s Lisa Murkowski, 63, also has no plans to attend, according to a spokesperson, nor does Utah\u2019s Mitt Romney, 73. Collins, Murkowski and Romney have criticized Trump on occasion, making their presence potentially uncomfortable at an event that will largely be a tribute to the president. But Grassley made it clear his decision is motivated solely by fear of contracting the coronavirus. \u2026\u00a0\u201cTrump himself signaled Tuesday some flexibility regarding the convention. \u2018When we signed a few weeks ago, it looked good. And now all of a sudden it\u2019s spiking up a little bit and that\u2019s going to go down,\u2019 the president told television host Greta Van Susteren. \u2018It really depends on the timing. .\u2009.\u2009. We can do a lot of things, but we\u2019re very flexible.\u2019\u2026 For some, going is a way to show their support for Trump. Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), 64, avoided the nominating convention in 2016 as part of his public rejection of Trump\u2019s candidacy \u2026 But the senator\u2019s spokesman \u2026 said Graham, who is facing a contested election in a Trump-friendly state, would be there this time. Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), 50, who is also looking to win another term in November, has signaled she plans to be in Jacksonville, as has Sen. Mike Braun (R-Ind.), 66, who credits Trump with helping him win election in 2018.\u201dNew Hampshire\u2019s Republican governor defended Trump\u2019s decision to hold a rally in the state, but he\u2019s not attending.\u00a0Gov. Chris Sununu assured reporters that Trump's rally in the state could be pulled off safely and without a mandatory mask order, CNN reports. Sununu said that he plans on greeting Trump at some point during his visit, but that it was unlikely that he\u2019d attend the rally, citing health concerns.\u00a0Biden criticized Trump\u2019s campaign for taking aim at Sen. Tammy Duckworth, one of his potential running mates.\u00a0\u201cSpeaking at a virtual fundraiser that Duckworth (D-Ill.) also attended, [Biden] said it was \u2018disgusting, sickening\u2019 of Trump\u2019s circle to question her patriotism and that it was a \u2018reflection of the depravity of what\u2019s going on in the White House right now,\u2019\u201d Sean Sullivan reports. On Sunday, Duckworth was asked on CNN about activists\u2019 demands that statues of George Washington be removed because he owned slaves. \u201cI think we should listen to everybody. I think we should listen to the argument there,\u201d she said. Fox News host Tucker Carlson then attacked Duckworth, calling her an \u201cunimpressive person\u201d and suggesting that she and other Democratic leaders \u201cactually hate America.\u201d Trump shared a clip from Carlson\u2019s show.\u00a0No Americans are known to have died in the reported Russian bounty operation.Marine Gen. Frank McKenzie, \u201ca top U.S. military official confirmed Tuesday that U.S. intelligence assessed that Russia had offered to pay Taliban militants to kill American service members, but said there was no evidence the proposed payment scheme resulted in any U.S. troop deaths,\u201d the WSJ reports. \u201cAccording to the classified assessment, Russia\u2019s GRU military intelligence agency paid members of Afghanistan\u2019s Taliban movement to carry out lethal attacks on U.S. troops in that country. Russia has denied the existence of the arrangement.\u201d\u00a0McKenzie said he\u2019s confident that Iraqis will ask American troops to remain.\u00a0\"I believe the government of Iraq recognizes the true value that the coalition brings to the fight against Daesh (another name for ISIS) in Iraq, and I believe that going forward, they're going to want us to be with them,\" McKenzie said.

(ABC News)\u00a0Trump\u2019s worldview was forged by neglect and trauma at home, according to his niece\u2019s new book.\u201cTrump\u2019s view of the world was shaped by his desire during childhood to avoid his father\u2019s disapproval, according to the niece, Mary L. Trump, whose book is by turns a family history and a psychological analysis of her uncle,\u201d Shane Harris and Michael Kranish report. \u201cBut she writes that as Donald matured, his father came to envy his son\u2019s \u2018confidence and brazenness,\u2019 as well as his seemingly insatiable desire to flout rules and conventions, traits that brought them closer together as Donald became the right-hand man in the family real estate business.\u201dA book by NBC\u2019s Jacob Soboroff quotes top Pence aide Katie Miller questioning immigrant-heavy neighborhoods.\u00a0Miller, a Florida native, singled out Miami\u2019s Little Havana. \u201cI believe that if you come to America, you should assimilate,\u201d Miller said, per Soboroff. \u201cWhy do we need to have Little Havana?\u201d The comments drew ire from Republicans, since older Cuban American voters in Miami are a key part of Trump\u2019s strategy to win Florida in 2020.

National Guard and Arlington County police, is now under investigation by Congress and the inspectors general of the Interior Department and Justice Department and the subject of civil lawsuits,\u201d Tom Jackman reports. \u201cWhen investigators review a police operation, they typically rely on audio and video recordings made by police to verify accounts made in statements or interviews. But the Park Police, along with nearly all federal uniformed police, have never worn body cameras. Officers and commanders said they expected that their comments and orders made during the operation would be captured electronically, to create a contemporaneous record of the event. But that didn\u2019t happen. \u2018At the conclusion of the demonstrations,\u2019 Park Police Lt. Jonathan Hofflinger said, \u2018we discovered that the radio recorder was not working and did not record any transmissions. However, written radio logs were generated as a redundant practice. This recorder issue has since been rectified.\u2019\u201d\u00a0As statues of the Founding Fathers fall, a debate rages over where protesters should draw the line. \u201cIn three cases, protesters targeted figures of U.S. presidents \u2014 George Washington, Thomas Jefferson and Ulysses S. Grant \u2014 prompting a Twitter storm from Trump and outrage from those who see the felling of the statues as an attack on American history. The monuments have also ignited debate among the protesters themselves over where to draw the line on historical figures that some say are too morally compromised to be venerated,\u201d Annie Gowen reports. \u201cThe demonstrators\u2019 views range from support for removal of all monuments to an embrace slow-paced community discussion and historical review. \u2026 For some demonstrators, it\u2019s not the image of a particular president that is important, but how the leader is portrayed.\u201d\u00a0Christopher Columbus symbols are falling across the country.

U.S. and foreign officials spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive troop withdrawal issue.ADJust weeks later, Trump announced that he was reducing U.S. deployments in Germany by 9,500, from the current total of 34,500.U.S. remains on the sidelines in Libya\u2019s conflict as Russia extends its reachSince taking office, Trump has been struggling to fulfill his 2016 campaign pledge to significantly reduce the nearly 200,000 American military personnel then overseas, already the smallest number in many decades. In countries such as Afghanistan, U.S. troops are merely serving as \u201cpolice,\u201d he has argued, while Germany, South Korea and others that could afford to defend themselves are getting U.S. protection on the cheap at taxpayer expense.ADBut Trump has been stymied at virtually every turn. While there have been some relatively minor shifts in distribution \u2014 and since 2017 the Defense Department no longer includes troops in Afghanistan, Syria and Iraq in its unclassified, published tallies \u2014 the overall total of those serving abroad is believed to have slightly increased since Barack Obama left office.ADIn the past, members of his own administration, including military leaders, have talked Trump out of specific withdrawals or employed delaying tactics. When the president ordered him in 2018 to tell Persian Gulf partners to send their own troops to Syria so the United States could get out, former national security adviser John Bolton wrote in his recent book, Bolton slow-walked the idea until it went away. Trump eventually cut the numbers by more than half, without any Arab replacements or financial contribution.Trump has often said that he is treated unfairly. \u201cI am the only person who can fight for the safety of our troops and bring them home from the ridiculous & costly Endless Wars, and be scorned,\u201d he tweeted in October. \u201cDemocrats always liked that position, until I took it.\u201dADThe idea of bringing home the troops resonates with many across the political spectrum. But numerous lawmakers of both parties have objected to Trump\u2019s efforts. Most recently, senior Republicans have warned that a major reduction in Germany would limit U.S. military flexibility in Europe and beyond, decrease U.S. influence in NATO and be a gift to Russia.ADLate last month, Senate Republicans Lindsey O. Graham (S.C.), Marco Rubio (Fla.) and Mitt Romney (Utah) joined Democratic Sens. Christopher A. Coons (Del.), Tim Kaine (Va.) and Jeanne Shaheen (N.H.) in sponsoring an amendment to the fiscal 2021 Defense Authorization Act that would limit the use of funds to reduce active-duty troops in Germany unless the Defense Department could certify that a long list of restrictive conditions had been met.At NATO, few diplomats believe that a significant troop pullback from Germany \u2014 a massive personnel and logistical undertaking \u2014 can be accomplished before the end of the year, or that the infrastructure exists to house them elsewhere in Europe. U.S. opinion polls detailing Trump\u2019s plummeting popularity are being closely watched in alliance capitals and at the Brussels headquarters. NATO policymakers say that if Democrat Joe Biden is elected, they expect the troop reductions to be off the table.ADGerman officials were furious at having learned of the planned cuts from U.S. media reports. Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper, attempting to allay concerns and smooth ruffled feathers, told NATO on a trip to Brussels in June that the plans were still far from completion, four diplomats familiar with his visit said.ADOne senior NATO diplomat said that Esper offered few details but promised to \u201ccontinue to consult with allies. Like they have,\u201d the diplomat added with a clear touch of sarcasm.In the meantime, the official alliance position is that \u201cthe U.S. remains firmly committed to European security,\u201d a NATO official said.\u201cWhat we have seen over the last years is actually not a decrease but an increase in the U.S. presence in Europe,\u201d said the official, including a strong U.S. commitment to bolstering NATO\u2019s eastern flank with rotating deployments and pre-positioned equipment.ADArmy Secretary Ryan D. McCarthy told reporters Thursday as he returned from a multi-stop visit to Europe that he had not had any \u201cdirect discussions about the repositioning of forces on the continent at this time.\u201d\u201cThat information will be released in the coming weeks,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s all I\u2019ve got to say about that topic.\u201dADMcCarthy acknowledged that Poland and Lithuania have both expressed interest in having more U.S. troops in their countries if the United States is reshuffling its European profile. Polish President Andrzej Duda, a Trump favorite, last year offered to build a base there and name it Fort Trump.When Duda visited the White House on June 24, four days before the first round of voting in his reelection bid, Trump granted his wish, saying vaguely that \u201csome\u201d of the forces to be withdrawn from Germany would go to Poland. Duda was narrowly reelected in a runoff vote last week.ADTrump has long been harshly critical of Germany, charging that it is insufficiently grateful for U.S. \u201cdefense\u201d and has failed to pay its fair share of NATO expenses. Explaining his plans for the 9,500 troops, he told columnist Marc Thiessen this month that \u201cI\u2019m bringing about half home and half are going to different places that deserve it,\u201d including Poland.ADPentagon officials have said that the \u201crepositioning\u201d of forces around the world \u2014 in large part to confront China \u2014 is part of a comprehensive and long-overdue review of all U.S. overseas deployments expected to be completed in September.Indications earlier this year that downsizing was likely in Africa, where U.S. forces are fighting militant groups, brought howls of congressional disapproval and warnings of Islamic State and al-Qaeda expansion there.ADMilitary officials have long been expecting the U.S. troop footprint in the Middle East and Afghanistan to shrink at least modestly because of a trio of factors, including a reduced Islamic State, a hoped-for political settlement in Afghanistan and, perhaps most important, Trump\u2019s desire to reduce U.S. involvement in insurgent conflicts.But critics have warned that a reduced U.S. presence would conflict with the administration\u2019s pledge to continue \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d against Iran.ADThe first phase of the February U.S.-Taliban agreement \u2014 a downsizing of the American force in Afghanistan to 8,600 \u2014 has now been completed, eliminating the force expansion Trump authorized in 2017. The agreement envisions a full U.S. departure by the end of April, providing that the militants meet their commitments to reduce violence and embrace negotiations with the Afghan government.ADThe Pentagon has drawn up plans to reach a \u201cwaypoint\u201d in its own compliance with the deal, perhaps by late fall, by withdrawing another 4,000 troops. But the required Taliban and Afghan government progress in implementing the political aspects of the agreement has slowed, and violence is on the rise.In Iraq, administration officials have said the ongoing presence of U.S. forces, now numbering more than 5,000, is vital to continue training and assisting Iraq\u2019s security forces against Islamic State outbreaks, and to help Iraq resist Iranian dominance.ADMany Iraqi lawmakers demanded the full departure of American troops following the U.S. killing of Iranian military leader Qasem Soleimani in a Baghdad drone strike in January. Talks with the new government of Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi, who is due to visit Washington this month, are ongoing. Administration officials say they are optimistic and expect only a modest reduction in the force.Since early in his presidency, Trump has demanded that South Korea, where 28,500 U.S. troops are based, and Japan, which hosts more than 55,000, pay more for a robust American military presence.Washington and Seoul struggled to reach a cost-sharing deal in 2018. They ended up with only a one-year extension, to the end of 2019, with South Korea agreeing to pay $926\u00a0million, an 8\u00a0percent increase.Last year, Trump asked for a fivefold increase in what South Korea pays and threatened to \u201cget out of there if we don\u2019t get the five-billion-dollar deal,\u201d according to Bolton. No agreement has been reached, and in April more than 4,000 South Korean civilians employed at U.S. bases there were placed on unpaid furlough.

It was a sobering reminder that even the most powerful social networks are vulnerable to attacks.\u00a0Support our journalism. Subscribe today.arrow-rightThe hack impacted everyone from Joe Biden to Elon Musk, raising new concerns about Twitter\u2019s ability to keep global leaders\u2019 accounts safe. It's sure to have wide-ranging implications for the service that has become a core communication channel in American society, disseminating everything from President Trump's rockets to corporate news.\u00a0\u201cThe problem is that we all rely on Twitter as this public space that is safe and secure, and we know that the tweets that someone like a Joe Biden is sending out are authentic,\u201d Harper Reed, an entrepreneur who served as the 2012 Obama campaign\u2019s chief technology officer, told me. \u201cTwitter has proven to us that may not be true.\u201dAccounts belonging to prominent billionaires and politicians began posting similar messages yesterday afternoon asking for money to be sent to cryptocurrency accounts, Rachel Lerman, Joseph Marks and I reported. The messages received thousands of likes before they were taken off Twitter, and in some instances, they were posted again from the same account.Twitter is still investigating the situation, but it appears to have originated from a social engineering attack targeting Twitter employees. From the company:The hackers could have sown mass chaos with the privileged access they scored.\u00a0It appears the accounts were seeking financial gain based on what is known so far. But technologists warn they could have done far more damage after infiltrating the accounts of some of the world's most prominent figures. The incident demonstrates how the tools technology companies build can be misused, Reed said.ADAD\u201cWe\u2019re lucky this was a bitcoin scam and not something that was greater or more nefarious,\u201d he said.The incident is certain to reverberate through Washington, where Twitter is increasingly used by government officials.\u00a0Security experts have long fretted about bad actors infiltrating President Trump\u2019s account, which has become his favorite bully pulpit at all hours of the day and night. Now that the accounts of Biden and Barack Obama were hit, those concerns are no longer theoretical. \u00a0Trump\u2019s account did not post a bitcoin message and did not appear to be affected by the incident. But critics swiftly warned that the incident highlighted the risk of his social-media-first style of governance.\u00a0AD\u201cThis data breach in particular underscores just how troubling it is to have a president who dictates policy ad hoc over Twitter and practices the opposite of responsible digital citizenship,\u201d Rep. Jennifer Wexton (D-Va.), founder of the Congressional Task Force on Digital Citizenship, told me.ADIt's also certain to increase concerns Twitter could be compromised closer to Election Day. If hackers gained similar access in November, they could disrupt voting by pushing voter fraud or planting false information about polling locations being impacted by the coronavirus.\u00a0From Ryan Calo, professor at the University of Washington School of Law:The breach also raises concerns that Twitter could be leveraged to wreak financial havoc.\u00a0The infiltrators also compromised the accounts of prominent tech billionaires, including Musk, Microsoft founder Bill Gates and Amazon chief executive and Washington Post owner Jeff Bezos. That worries company leaders who say the bad actors could have wreaked havoc on the stock market, as tweets from world leaders have been known to move markets.\u00a0AD\u201cIt will become real to people what influence and power these channels have,\u201d Ashkan Soltani, a former Federal Trade Commission chief technologist, told me in an interview.\u00a0Twitter will inevitably face greater political scrutiny.\u00a0Social media companies are already under a microscope in this election year. And with each breached account yesterday, Twitter's political problems multiplied.\u00a0ADThis isn\u2019t Twitter\u2019s first brush with cybersecurity issues, and the company is currently under an order with the FTC related to privacy settlement. Depending on the circumstances that caused this breach, the agency may move to open an investigation into whether the company violated the terms of that agreement, Soltani told me. The FTC declined to comment.\u00a0ADAlready the incident is sparking scrutiny on Capitol Hill. Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) wrote a letter to Twitter chief executive Jack Dorsey on Wednesday evening, calling on the company to take immediate steps to secure the service and contact the FBI and Justice Department.\u201cAs you know, millions of your users rely on your service not just to tweet publicly but also to communicate privately through your direct message service,\u201d Hawley wrote. \u201cA successful attack on your system\u2019s servers represents a threat to all of your users\u2019 privacy and data security.\u201dADTwitter has struck an apologetic tone about the incident. From Dorsey:\u00a0Rant and raveA temporary freeze on verified accounts also led to chaos on the platform. CNBC\u2019s Annie Palmer:Others wondered if the temporary freeze on blue check marks lead to a new world.ADJoe Calvello, associate director of state media at Planned Parenthood Federation of America:Adam Conner of the Center for American Progress:But it didn\u2019t last long. Taylor Lorenz of the New York Times:BuzzFeed\u2019s Hayes Brown:But we\u2019d still buy a cross-stitch of this tweet:Our top tabsThe European Union just restricted data transfers to the United States, dealing a blow to tech companies.\u00a0The European Union's top court ruled that data of E.U. residents is not sufficiently protected from government surveillance when it is transferred to the United States, Michael Birnbaum reports from Brussels. That could have stark implications for global commerce, especially smaller businesses.\u00a0ADADThe court struck down a key data transfer agreement known as Privacy Shield because it did not adequately uphold E.U. law. The move could force thousands of companies to reconsider how they move data from Europe, and it will prompt new negotiations between the United States and Europe over how to store Europeans' data on U.S. soil.\u00a0Tech companies were bracing for this outcome, and they called for the governments to swiftly begin negotiations.\u00a0\u201cThe interruption of transatlantic data flows resulting from this decision is a significant setback for all businesses and industries in the U.S. and EU who relied on Privacy Shield and hampers their ability to conduct day-to-day operations\u2014everything from accessing the cloud to managing human resources and running payroll,\" said Jason Oxman, president and chief executive of the trade association ITI. \u201cThe Court\u2019s decision negatively affects the two economies\u2019 shared efforts to facilitate trade while providing necessary privacy protections for EU citizens.\u201dADADCompanies blasted the move as the economy is struggling in the wake of the coronavirus. \"This is an unwelcome development at a time when businesses on both sides of the Atlantic are focusing on recovering from the economic impacts of covid-19 and are increasingly relying on data-driven tools and services to do so,\u201d said Thomas Bou\u00e9, director general of policy\u2014EMEA at BSA, another tech trade group.\u00a0Other larger companies said the ruling would not immediately impact their business. Microsoft told customers in a blog post that the court\u2019s ruling does not change their ability to transfer data today between the EU and U.S. using its cloud product.\u00a0Parler wants to be the free-speech social network, but an influx of new users are pushing the boundaries.Parler\u2019s user base increased by 1 million users in just one week after Twitter moved to moderate posts from Trump that violated its policies. That\u2019s putting pressure on the company, so Parler chief executive and co-founder John Matze\u00a0took to the platform in late June to explain its house rules in response to the posts, Rachel Lerman reports.\u00a0ADAD\u201cHere are a few basic rules we need you to follow on Parler,\u201d he wrote. He added bulletin points including, \u201cWhen you disagree with someone, posting pictures of your fecal matter in the comment section WILL NOT BE TOLERATED.\u201dThe company has brought on 200 volunteer content moderators and is looking for more. Matze said in a statement that he did not believe the app\u2019s guidelines conflicted with free speech.Parler could also have its say in the ongoing antitrust debate over Big Tech.Two Republican members of the House Judiciary Committee last week called for a meeting with Parler. House lawmakers are expected to grill the chief executives of Apple, Google, Facebook and Amazon later this month.The State Department will restrict the visas of some Huawei employees, citing human rights abuses.Secretary of State Mike Pompeo accused some employees of providing \u201cmaterial support\u201d to the Chinese Communist Party at a news conference.\u00a0ADThe action also applies to other Chinese companies sanctioned by the United States for aiding human rights abuses. The move is the latest escalation in the United States\u2019 siege on the Chinese telecommunications company, which it has accused of posing a national security threat.\u201cTelecommunications companies around the world should consider themselves on notice,\u201d Pompeo said.\u00a0\u201cIf they are doing business with Huawei, they are doing business with human rights abusers.\u201dU.S. officials say the Chinese Communist Party could compel the company to provide a backdoor for espionage and has in the past.\u00a0Pompeo also praised the United Kingdom\u2019s decision to phase out Huawei\u2019s equipment from its 5G networks, an action that the White House takes credit for spurring.\u00a0\u201cThis isn\u2019t about commercial interests, this is about protecting the information,\u201d Pompeo said. \u201cI think in fact the tide has turned there and you\u2019ll see this continue in [other] countries.\u201d\u00a0Workforce reportFacebook struggles to recruit and retain black engineers, company data shows.Black employees make up just 1.7 percent of the company\u2019s technical roles, up from 1.5 percent last year, Bloomberg News reports.

Subscribe today.arrow-rightMaking one of his biggest media appearances in months \u2014 an hour-long, sit-down interview with \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d anchor Chris Wallace \u2014 Trump was visibly rattled and at times hostile as he struggled to answer for his administration\u2019s failure to contain the coronavirus, which has claimed more than 137,000 lives in the United States.On a range of other topics, including the racial justice movement and the Confederate flag, the president positioned himself firmly outside the political mainstream. And Trump suggested he might not accept the results of November\u2019s general election should he lose because he predicted without evidence that \u201cmail-in voting is going to rig the election.\u201dADADIn a season of remarkable public appearances by a politically wounded president, the Wallace interview was still extraordinary, in part because of the volley of false claims by Trump and aggressive, real-time fact-checking by his questioner.As the coronavirus crisis spins out of control, Trump issues directives \u2014 but still no clear planTrump \u2014 who aides say no longer attends coronavirus task force meetings because he does not have time \u2014 showed himself to be particularly misinformed about the basics of the virus that has been ravaging the nation for more than four months.Confronted by Wallace with a chart showing that the number of coronavirus cases last week more than doubled from the spring peak in April, Trump replied: \u201cIf we didn\u2019t test, you wouldn\u2019t be able to show that chart. If we tested half as much, those numbers would be down.\u201dBy the president\u2019s logic, that assumes people contract the virus only if they test positive, ignoring the fact that many people are asymptomatic carriers and unknowingly spread the contagion without taking a test or being reported.Wallace later explained to Trump that the number of tests has increased by 37 percent but the number of cases has shot up by 194 percent. Trump replied, \u201cMany of those cases are young people that would heal in a day. They have the sniffles and we put it down as a test. Many of them \u2014 don\u2019t forget, I guess it\u2019s like 99.7 percent, people are going to get better and [in] many cases, they\u2019re going to get better very quickly.\u201dADADThough people in their 20s and 30s, who make up a growing proportion of cases, have been hospitalized at a lower rate than older people, many still have suffered severe illness and some have died.Former vice president Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, reacted to Trump\u2019s interview in a statement Sunday: \u201cThe past six months have proven again and again that it\u2019s Donald Trump who doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s talking about when it comes to COVID-19 .\u2009.\u2009. When it comes to the coronavirus, you can\u2019t believe a word he says.\u201dA growing number of Americans disapprove of Trump\u2019s handling of the pandemic. A new Washington Post-ABC News poll found 38 percent approve of his performance and 60\u00a0percent disapprove. The same survey found Biden leading Trump by double digits nationally, 55 percent to 40 percent.ADADIn an attempt to regain their political footing, Trump and his aides recently have sought to divert attention from the soaring number of coronavirus cases by focusing on the rate of deaths. In the Fox interview, Trump falsely asserted, \u201cI think we have one of the lowest mortality rates in the world.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not true, sir,\u201d Wallace replied. \u201cWe had 900 deaths on a single day just this week.\u201dTrump shouted to aides hovering nearby: \u201cCan you please get the mortality rates?\u201d White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany quickly presented Trump with data she said was from Deborah Birx, a physician and the White House coronavirus response coordinator, backing up his claim.AD\u201cNumber one low mortality fatality rates,\u201d Trump claimed.At that point, Fox interrupted the taped interview for Wallace to explain to his viewers that according to data from Johns Hopkins University, the United States ranked seventh among 20 countries in mortality rate, worse than Brazil and Russia. The White House relied on European data showing Italy and Spain doing worse than the United States but Brazil and South Korea doing better. The White House chart did not include Russia and other countries doing better, according to Wallace.When Wallace pointed out that coronavirus deaths in the United States were still about 1,000 a day, Trump said: \u201cIt came from China. They should\u2019ve never let it escape, they should\u2019ve never let it out, but it is what it is.\u201dADADTrump then hypothesized that the case count in Europe was so much lower than in the United States because \u201cthey don\u2019t test,\u201d as opposed to a sign that the virus was not as rampant there because their countries had largely contained it.By conducting mass testing, Trump said, \u201cWe are creating trouble for the fake news to come along and say, \u2018Oh, we have more cases.\u2019\u2009\u201dTrump reiterated his long-held theory that the virus would somehow \u201cdisappear,\u201d a claim not grounded in scientific fact.\u201cI will be right eventually,\u201d Trump told Wallace. \u201cYou know I said, \u2018It\u2019s going to disappear.\u2019 I\u2019ll say it again. It\u2019s going to disappear, and I\u2019ll be right .\u2009.\u2009. You know why? Because I\u2019ve been right probably more than anybody else.\u201dRancor between scientists and Trump allies threatens pandemic response as cases surgeTrump used his Fox interview to continue the White House\u2019s remarkable assault on some of the scientists and public health professionals spearheading the government\u2019s response. The president called Anthony S. Fauci, the nation\u2019s top infectious-disease expert, \u201ca little bit of an alarmist.\u201d He noted that Fauci had argued internally against restricting travel from China, which Trump ordered in late January, and had initially said all Americans did not need to wear masks, before there was scientific evidence that doing so would help slow the spread.Trump also challenged the assessment of Robert Redfield, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, who again warned last week that the pandemic could worsen this fall when flu season begins, reflecting widespread scientific consensus. \u201cI don\u2019t think he knows,\u201d Trump said of Redfield.Trump sought to draw a hard line on the coronavirus relief bill, saying it must include a payroll tax cut and liability protections for businesses, as lawmakers prepare to plunge into negotiations over unemployment benefits and other key provisions in coming days. Republican leaders are largely dismissive of the idea of cutting payroll taxes, which fund Social Security, while siding with Trump on the liability issue.ADADThe Fox interview was conducted outdoors on a White House patio on an oppressively hot day \u2014 the president\u2019s choice, as Wallace twice noted. Trump joked that he wanted to see Wallace sweat, but it was the president\u2019s face that glistened with sweat as the Fox anchor engaged him on a wide range of other topics, including the race and justice issues that convulsed the country. Trump declined to say whether he found the Confederate flag offensive and defended what many Americans view as a symbol of slavery, racial oppression and treason.\u201cWhen people proudly have their Confederate flags, they\u2019re not talking about racism,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThey love their flag. It represents the South. They like the South. People right now like the South.\u201dWallace followed up: \u201cSo you\u2019re not offended by it?\u201dAD\u201cWell, I\u2019m not offended either by Black Lives Matter,\u201d Trump replied. \u201cThat\u2019s freedom of speech. You know, the whole thing with cancel culture, we can\u2019t cancel our whole history. We can\u2019t forget that the North and the South fought. We have to remember that, otherwise we\u2019ll end up fighting again.\u201dADTrump also teased the possibility that he might not accept the election results if he were to lose, jeopardizing America\u2019s tradition of a peaceful transfer of power between presidents.When Wallace asked Trump whether he considers himself a \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cgracious\u201d loser, the president replied that he doesn\u2019t like to lose. Then he added, \u201cYou don\u2019t know until you see. It depends. I think mail-in voting is going to rig the election. I really do.\u201dFor weeks now, Trump has claimed without evidence that the rise in voting by mail in many states makes voting susceptible to widespread fraud.AD\u201cAre you suggesting that you might not accept the results of the election?\u201d Wallace asked.\u201cNo,\u201d Trump responded. \u201cI have to see.\u201dLater in the interview, pressed on whether he will accept the results, Trump again declined to say. \u201cI have to see,\u201d he said.ADBiden campaign spokesman Andrew Bates responded to Trump\u2019s remarks in a statement: \u201cThe American people will decide this election. And the United States government is perfectly capable of escorting trespassers out of the White House.\u201dTrump sought to portray Biden as mentally vacant, telling Wallace that he did not want to characterize his opponent as \u201csenile\u201d but positing that \u201cJoe doesn\u2019t know he\u2019s alive\u201d and is \u201cmentally shot.\u201dTrump then challenged Biden to a cognitive test, which the president characterized as exceedingly difficult. During a physical exam in 2018, Trump took the Montreal Cognitive Assessment \u2014 which includes animal pictures and other simple queries aimed at detecting mild cognitive impairment such as dementia \u2014 and has regularly boasted about it since.Wallace told Trump that he tried the test himself after hearing the president brag about passing it. Wallace said \u201cit\u2019s not the hardest test,\u201d adding that one of the questions on the version he took was to properly identify a picture of an elephant.\u201cI\u2019ll bet you couldn\u2019t even answer the last five questions,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI\u2019ll bet you couldn\u2019t. They get very hard, the last five questions.\u201d\u201cWell, one of them was count back from 100 by seven,\u201d Wallace said, adding: \u201cNinety-three.\u201d\n\n\n\n", "comment": "6.9k Comments", "topic": "Politics"}, {"cover": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/HZJ7DVF34YI6VF6BNTYRN77CNQ.jpghttps://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/HZJ7DVF34YI6VF6BNTYRN77CNQ.jpg", "title": "California rejected Chinese company\u2019s push to help with coronavirus testing.

Subscribe today.arrow-rightIn the end, the advisers recommended that California exercise caution about BGI and its U.S. subsidiary, CGI; one of the advisers recommended avoiding them all together. But BGI\u2019s efforts to sell testing supplies in a state now facing a new surge of infections underscores a dilemma the United States will face again and again as China\u2019s ambitious technology companies gain prominence globally: Under what circumstances should U.S. officials and businesses engage with the Chinese tech sector?ADADBob Kocher, a physician and venture capital executive who volunteers on the state\u2019s coronavirus-testing task force, said in an interview that BGI\u2019s pitching raised red flags for him. For one, he was worried about relying on a Chinese company for critical medical supplies, given U.S.-China tensions. He was also concerned that allowing a China-headquartered entity to equip U.S. laboratories for coronavirus testing or other future purposes could give China access to sensitive patient data.Kocher said his concern was sparked in part by a brief and inconclusive U.S. intelligence report cautioning that CGI \u201cmay be vulnerable to Chinese influence.\u201d He added, however, that he has seen no evidence of data breaches involving BGI or CGI, and BGI wholly rejected the idea.Kocher discussed the matter with another of the state\u2019s unpaid coronavirus advisers, D.J. Patil, a health-care-technology executive who previously served as the Obama administration\u2019s chief data scientist. In an interview, Patil said he raised a different concern \u2014 that giving BGI a bigger role in U.S. laboratories could strengthen China in the fast-growing and ethically sensitive fields of biotechnology and genetic science \u2014 sectors the United States hopes to continue leading.ADADKocher in early April advised California\u2019s health secretary, Mark Ghaly, to steer clear of BGI supplies, saying the state had better options, and the health secretary agreed, said Kocher, a partner at Venrock, a venture-capital fund that previously owned a stake in BGI rival Illumina and currently owns part of a company aiming to compete in a field where BGI is also present.Patil said he advised testing task force members to tread carefully and consider the long-term ramifications of using BGI supplies.Ghaly didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment. \u201cThe state has evaluated multiple testing options in its efforts to significantly expand the availability of covid-19 tests and makes decisions based on which testing platforms best meet the needs of California and its diverse residents,\" said Ali Bay, a spokeswoman for the California Department of Public Health.BGI called security concerns about its technology \u201cnot valid\u201d and lacking in any evidence.Inside America\u2019s mask crunch: A slow government reaction and an industry wary of liability\u201cThe testing system that we deploy in the U.S. makes it impossible for us to have access to patient data,\u201d Jeremy Nickolenko, an American who heads global commercial partnerships from BGI\u2019s U.S. offices, said in an interview. \u201cWe can provide the gear, but it\u2019s a U.S. laboratory that\u2019s actually running the assay and getting the results, and they deal with the data, as they should, per regulation.\u201dADAD\u201cWe are a significant testing and technology company with a global footprint, and we can actually make a very significant impact in the midst of a pretty terrible pandemic,\u201d Nickolenko added. BGI declined to make its leadership in China available for interviews.Other countries have welcomed BGI to set up high-speed testing labs, including Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. And testing centers in Sweden and Kansas \u2014 and in California\u2019s Santa Clara County, despite the state\u2019s cold shoulder \u2014 have purchased supplies from the company, saying they didn\u2019t fear data breaches.Santa Clara officials took the security concerns into account before buying one piece of equipment but are \u201c100 percent confident that no private information would be made available to the company,\" said deputy county executive David Campos.\u2018Dilemma\u2019 over Chinese techChina is spending billions on high-tech development, aiming to dominate technologies that will shape the future of business and defense. Those ambitions have concerned not only the Trump administration and Congress but also U.S. business leaders such as former Google chief executive Eric Schmidt, who have warned that the United States cannot afford to cede critical innovation to China.ADADTension has already come to a head over Chinese telecom giant Huawei, the world\u2019s largest provider of mobile network gear \u2014 a field from which U.S. companies are largely absent. The United States calls Huawei a security risk, which the company denies, and has undertaken an international lobbying campaign, with mixed results, to persuade other countries not to buy from Huawei.The Trump administration has targeted other Chinese companies, restricting trade with more than a dozen it accuses of supplying surveillance gear in the western province of Xinjiang, where U.S. officials and human rights groups say China\u2019s ruling Communist Party is holding Muslims in mass detention camps.And the United States has blocked Chinese investors from buying U.S. technology companies deemed strategic to economic growth or national security. Last year, the Trump administration forced a Chinese company founded by BGI\u2019s former chief executive to sell its majority stake in a U.S. health-care-data company, PatientsLikeMe.ADADAt the same time, Chinese companies, often backed by significant government financing that critics say can sometimes represent an unfair subsidy, are cranking out a slew of high-tech products. Their growing output, including industrial drones, electric buses and more, makes Chinese tech harder to avoid or contain.Trump administration exempts face masks and medical gowns from import tariffs as coronavirus spreads\u201cOne and a half billion people are going to come up with a lot of cool stuff,\u201d said Rod Hunter, a trade lawyer at Baker McKenzie and a former national security official in the George W. Bush administration. \u201cIf it\u2019s something with the potential to save human lives, are we going to say we don\u2019t want it? For U.S. policymakers, it\u2019s going to be a tough choice.\u201dV.J. Sahi, a partner at the corporate advisory firm Clark Street Associates, who was hired by BGI\u2019s U.S. subsidiary to pitch state officials, said the campaign hasn\u2019t borne much fruit. \u201cCandidly, we haven\u2019t had a lot of success. There is a lot of xenophobia,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cSome people have been direct with us and said, \u2018No, because it\u2019s from China.\u2019\u201dADADCalifornia is doing a better job providing coronavirus testing than many U.S. states are, but it lags behind the most highly regarded countries and has reported some \u201cworrying signs\u201d in recent days, according to Jennifer Nuzzo, lead epidemiologist for the Johns Hopkins Covid-19 Testing Insights Initiative.A low rate of positive tests is a sign of a strong testing program. About 4 to 5 percent of tests in California have come back positive in recent weeks, though that number is now rising toward 6 percent \u2014 better than Arizona\u2019s 23 percent but worse than South Korea\u2019s rate of under 2 percent, Nuzzo said.\u201cThere are some worrying signs in California. Positivity and case numbers are ticking up,\u201d Nuzzo said. \u201cI think measures the governor is taking to address increasing case growth is important.\u201dADADThe state\u2019s public health department says it is making progress. \u201cCalifornia\u2019s testing capacity continues to increase dramatically \u2014 scaling up from just 2,000 per day in April\u201d to about 100,000 a day now, the department said in a statement.Sensitive workBGI, based in the southern tech hub of Shenzhen, is well known in the fields of genetic research and medical diagnostics. Its co-founder and chairman, Wang Jian, is a prominent geneticist who spent six years as a research fellow in the United States during the 1980s and 1990s.The company\u2019s coronavirus-related products enable a standard form of testing that extracts genetic material known as RNA from nasal swab samples, then determines whether it matches the genetics of the novel coronavirus.ADA separate BGI business is more closely tied to the future of biotech: selling DNA-sequencing machines and services. The machines, which resemble photocopiers, are like fancy digital cameras that scan DNA molecules to decode the full genetic makeup of people, animals and other organisms.ADThe genetic maps, or genomes, the machines generate are a hot commodity as researchers worldwide attempt to decipher the genetic underpinnings of life and disease, with the hope of finding new medicines or crops.BGI has some prominent supporters in U.S. academia, including George Church, the Harvard geneticist who has served on the Chinese company\u2019s scientific advisory board since 2007. In 2017, BGI established the George Church Institute of Regenesis, a research collaboration between Church\u2019s lab and about a dozen staffers at BGI in China.As cases surge, lines for coronavirus tests sometimes stretch miles in the summer heatThe group is attempting to synthesize organisms from human-made DNA, among other projects, Church said in an interview. Church also has a business relationship with BGI: Consumers who want their genomes decoded can send saliva samples to a company he co-founded, Nebula Genomics, which sends them to BGI labs in Hong Kong for sequencing.Harris Lewin, a professor of evolution and ecology at University of California at Davis, has worked with BGI through the Earth Biogenome Project, an international consortium aiming to sequence many of the planet\u2019s species. \u201cThey\u2019ve honored all their commitments to the organization,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ve been good partners.\u201dSome of BGI\u2019s activities have drawn scrutiny, however. Over the past year, a unit of BGI has sold Chinese police the supplies they needed to collect and analyze DNA from millions of men and boys who have no serious criminal history, according to a recent report by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, which called the collection a violation of human rights and a disturbing extension of China\u2019s efforts to \u201cmanage and control society.\u201dThe BGI subsidiary Forensic Genomics International is one of two dozen Chinese companies that have supplied testing kits or other materials to the project, along with the U.S. company Thermo Fisher, according to the study, which analyzed government purchase orders. The New York Times earlier reported details of the project.Emile Dirks, an author of the report and a PhD candidate at the University of Toronto, said the men and boys being targeted \u201creally have no capacity to refuse\u201d to give a blood sample and are often located in rural or semi-rural communities where public scrutiny of the collection is less likely. He said the purchase orders make reference to this police-led collection program, suggesting that companies \u201care aware on some level what is being done with their technology.\u201dIn a written statement addressing the report, BGI said it \u201cdoes not condone and would never be involved in any human-rights abuses.\u201dThe company \u201chas a long track record in applying strict ethical standards and protection of data privacy and security,\" added the statement, which was provided by Matthew Ballard, senior vice president of the public relations firm BCW Global.American researchers who have interacted with Wang, BGI\u2019s chairman, call him a talented scientist who has at times stirred controversy. One pointed to remarks Wang made at a 2018 panel discussion where he said that employees of BGI, which sells prenatal tests, are \u201cnot allowed\u201d to have babies with birth defects.\"If there is a birth defect, it is a humiliation for all 7,000 of our employees. It would mean we are swindling the public,\u201d he said, in remarks reported by the Chinese publication Sixth Tone and captured on video.Asked about the comments, BGI said \u201cthere are no such company rules.\u201dCoronavirus offersBGI was founded as the nonprofit Beijing Genomics Institute in 1999, to participate in the Human Genome Project, the international consortium that mapped the first human genome. It relocated to Shenzhen in 2007. In late 2009, it received a $1.5 billion line of credit from the state-run China Development Bank, after which it purchased 128 DNA sequencers from California-based Illumina, the U.S. company announced. At the time, it was Illumina\u2019s largest-ever order.Three years later, BGI and Illumina found themselves on opposite sides in a bidding war to acquire Complete Genomics, a California-based company whose acquisition gave BGI access to the sequencing technology it now sells. During that fight, BGI complained that Illumina was raising unfair national security concerns about it, but the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS, reviewed the deal for national security risks and cleared it.Still, the one-page U.S. intelligence report reviewed by Kocher and Patil, dated April 10, said BGI\u2019s U.S. subsidiary \u201cmay be vulnerable to Chinese influence\" via its parent company, which the report said had \u201cmultiple connections to Chinese state government,\u201d including the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Ministry of Science and Technology.\"Chinese influence over CGI could provide China with access to the sensitive medical data of patients who use its medical testing,\u201d said the unclassified report from the Department of the Air Force Office of Special Investigations, which The Washington Post reviewed. It did not elaborate on this risk.More coronavirus tests are coming back positive, contrary to what Trump and the House Republican leader claimThe Air Force declined to comment on BGI or on the specifics of the document, but said in a statement provided by spokeswoman Linda Card: \u201cA foreign organization that may incidentally gain access to the protected health information (PHI) of current or future U.S. Government personnel through community-based medical testing services, may present an increased opportunity for third-party, foreign intelligence entities to access and exploit that data.\u201dIt added: \u201cThe reports that we produce for senior leaders and decision makers are sometimes drawn from publicly available information and placed in a single document to help inform.\u201dAsked about the report, BGI said it \u201ctakes all aspects of data protection, privacy and ethics extremely seriously\u201d and has \u201cno access to patient data\u201d via coronavirus testing. It added that BGI is not \u201cowned or funded by the Chinese government.\u201dMonths of expertise BGI\u2019s expertise in the current health crisis dates to late December, when the company determined that the covid-19 illness appearing in Wuhan, China, was caused by a novel coronavirus, according to Chinese media outlet Caixin.On Jan. 25, two days after China locked down Wuhan, Wang led a team to the city to set up testing, according to the company, which later opened similar \u201cFire Eye\u201d labs in Shenzhen, Beijing and other cities.By the end of March, BGI and China were promoting the testing gear all over the world. After a phone call between Chinese President Xi Jinping and Saudi King Salman, Saudi Arabia hired the company to establish six testing labs and provide 500 Chinese testing specialists, according to the Saudi Press Agency. In the United Arab Emirates, BGI and a local cloud computing company, Group 42, jointly opened a testing lab in late March, the Chinese company said.As the United States struggled to ramp up testing, offers of BGI supplies arrived at all levels of California government.\u201cWe propose to establish the world\u2019s largest COVID-19 testing facility through a public private partnership,\" said an April 5 proposal that BGI\u2019s U.S. subsidiary sent state officials, the mayor of San Jose and task force members, including Kocher. \u201cBy working with the state\u2019s existing CLIA testing labs, this operation could be running tests in less than 2 weeks,\u201d it added.BGI executive Nickolenko said the company\u2019s mention of CLIA labs, which are federally regulated, shows it was expecting California to be fully in charge of any testing operation.When these Boston doctors ran out of virus-testing swabs, they mobilized an army of 3-D printersA second proposal from BGI\u2019s partner in the United Arab Emirates, Group 42, struck Patil and Kocher as more concerning. It said Group 42 and BGI were ready to build two labs on a nonprofit basis and initially operate them.\u201cG42 and BGI will build, and initially for up to a 30-day period operate, and then transfer two Fire Eye Laboratories \u2026 to the State of California,\u201d read the March 23 proposal, sent to Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) by Group 42 Chief Executive Peng Xiao.\u201cG42 and BGI will provide the equipment, installation, validation and test protocols and train local staff in California to operate the labs,\" it said.\u201cWe will only recover from you our actual cost of setting up these two laboratories, which we estimate to be approximately $10,000,000. We will provide the necessary technical personnel to build the labs and train the operational personnel,\u201d said the proposal, which even offered to advance California money to help it cover costs.Patil said he was suspicious of the offer to construct the labs at cost and to advance California money. \u201cWhat\u2019s the catch here?\u201d he asked in an interview.In an emailed statement, G42 said it was \u201cprepared to absorb upfront costs in exchange for a long-term commitment from California to buy testing kits and supplies for the laboratory facility.\"BGI said: \u201cG42 initiated contact with California on behalf of our partnership in the UAE as a possible way to help.\" Nickolenko said he didn\u2019t sign off on the proposal, and that BGI\u2019s U.S. unit has never proposed operating California labs.Newsom\u2019s administration declined to comment on the letter.U.S. market toeholdPatil said he was also concerned that allowing BGI into U.S. labs could give it market access that the United States would later regret. The country and China are competing to develop industries around DNA sequencing and genomics, he said, including \u201cprecision-medicine\u201d ventures to deliver treatments tailored to a patient\u2019s genetic profile. Why should the United States help a Chinese company establish its equipment and services in that field, he asked?\u201cWhat China has really been trying to do is try to get to a place where they can own the entire supply chain for genomic testing,\u201d Patil said. \u201cThis is a toehold that they build on.\u201dHe added that there are risks to helping China lead a new industry facing so many ethical quandaries. \u201cChina is not transparent with their use of technology, and they are using technology in many cases to oppress groups. Do you want them setting the standards?\u201d he asked.BGI said it \u201cpays particular attention to complying with scientific ethics and personal privacy protection at all times.\u201dThe quantum revolution is coming, and Chinese scientists are at the forefrontKocher said he feared patients\u2019 personal data could leak back to China if California labs opened up to BGI equipment or personnel.In the case of coronavirus testing, that could include information on the sample test tubes, such as a patient\u2019s name, date of birth or the name of their doctor, he said. While this data is sometimes hidden behind a bar code, labs decode the bar codes to submit bills to insurance companies, so the data can exist in lab information systems, Kocher said.Nickolenko said BGI would have \u201cabsolutely no access\u201d to data flowing through the laboratory information system.Lars Engstrand, a microbiologist who is overseeing a coronavirus-testing lab at Sweden\u2019s Karolinska Institute that is using BGI equipment, was skeptical that any personal data could leak out, saying he didn\u2019t see any way to obtain patient information protected behind the bar codes on the samples he sees.Santa Clara County, the home of Silicon Valley and site of the earliest-known coronavirus deaths in the United States, said its officials considered privacy concerns before buying BGI test materials but were confident they could use the supplies in a secure fashion.The county purchased test kits and a piece of equipment that automates the extraction of RNA from the nasal-swab samples, said Campos, the county official.\u201cIt is a stand-alone piece of equipment. It is not connected to any computer in our system,\u201d Campos said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have any patient information,\u201d he added.The instrument will allow the county to perform more tests per minute than other vendors\u2019 equipment would, which was the county\u2019s priority, he said.Lewin, the University of California professor, said he would like to see BGI products available in the U.S., to boost levels of coronavirus testing. \u201cAny competition that increases testing capacity, drives down costs and improves quality is good,\u201d he said.Eva Dou and Ruth Eglash contributed to this report.", "comment": "0 Comments", "topic": "Business"}, {"cover": "", "title": "5 Things to Know for Today", "date": "Jul 24, 2020", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/5-things-to-know-for-today/2020/07/24/0c84d702-cd95-11ea-99b0-8426e26d203b_story.html", "keyword": "China and the world order", "website": "the Washington Post", "author": "", "content": "Your daily look at late-breaking news, upcoming events and the stories that will be talked about today:1.

Thiessen", "content": "This column is the second of two I\u2019m writing based on my interview with President Trump on Wednesday. Read the first part here.During an Oval Office interview with me this week, President Trump acknowledged for the first time that, in 2018, he authorized a covert cyberattack against Russia\u2019s Internet Research Agency, the St. Petersburg-based troll farm that spearheaded Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and was doing the same in the 2018 midterm elections.Support our journalism. Subscribe today.arrow-rightAsked whether he had launched the attack, Trump replied: \u201cCorrect.\u201dTrump said that, in 2016, President Barack Obama \u201cknew before the election that Russia was playing around. Or, he was told. Whether or not it was so or not, who knows? And he said nothing. And the reason he said nothing was that he didn\u2019t want to touch it because he thought [Hillary Clinton] was winning because he read phony polls. So, he thought she was going to win. And we had the silent majority that said, \u2018No, we like Trump.\u2019 \u201dADADUnlike Obama, Trump says, he acted on the intelligence he was given about Russia\u2019s election interference by striking its cyber capabilities.\u201cLook, we stopped it,\u201d the president said.The cyberattack was previously reported in The Post, but Trump had never officially confirmed it until now. Senior U.S. officials also confirmed for me that the strike occurred and was effective, taking the Internet Research Agency offline.Trump had elevated U.S. Cyber Command to the status of a unified command in 2017 and gave it new authorities to conduct offensive cyberoperations in 2018. The cyberattack appears to have been the first that was designed to frustrate Moscow\u2019s attempts to interfere with a U.S. election.ADRussian interference in the 2018 midterm elections was serious and pervasive. In February 2018, then-Director of National Intelligence Daniel Coats testified before the Senate Intelligence Committee that \u201cthe United States is under attack,\u201d and that Russia had been emboldened in 2018 by the success of its previous influence operations, for which the United States had imposed no price. During the hearing, Democrats accused the Trump administration of failing to prepare to protect the 2018 vote. \u201cWe\u2019ve had more than a year to get our act together and address the threat posed by Russia and implement a strategy to deter future attacks. But we still do not have a plan,\u201d the committee\u2019s top Democrat, Sen. Mark R. Warner (Va.), told the intelligence chiefs.ADWell, it turns out Trump did have a plan. In March 2018, during a White House news conference, Trump was asked about possible Russian election interference. \u201cWe won\u2019t allow that to happen,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe\u2019ll counteract whatever they do. We\u2019ll counteract it very strongly.\u201d And unlike his predecessor in 2016, he did so, using America\u2019s offensive cyber capabilities in an unprecedented way against Russia\u2019s interference operations.During our interview, Trump said the cyberattack was part of a broader policy of confronting Russia throughout the world. \u201cNobody has been tougher on Russia than I have,\u201d he said. The president offered a litany of actions he has taken to counteract Russia. \u201cI could give you 30 different things,\u201d he said. \u201cI sent [Ukraine] a massive number of antitank busters. I sent them military equipment and Obama sent them nothing. That\u2019s against Russia,\u201d he says. \u201cI made us the number one oil-producing country in the world. It wasn\u2019t even close. I made us number one \u2014 that\u2019s bad for Russia.\u201dADThe president also cited his pressure on Germany to cancel the Nord Stream 2 natural-gas pipeline from Russia and avoid becoming even more dependent on Moscow than it already is. \u201cGermany is paying billions of dollars, billions to Russia,\u201d Trump says. \u201cAnd we\u2019re supposed to protect Germany from Russia. How does that work?\u201dADBut his \u201cbiggest\u201d move of all to counter Russia, Trump said, has been his restoration of America\u2019s military: \u201cI rebuilt our military. We now have the newest military we\u2019ve ever had. . . . That\u2019s not good for Russia either. You understand?\u201dTrump has used that military against Russia, and not just in cyberspace. The New York Times reported that U.S. forces killed several hundred Russian mercenaries during a February 2018 firefight in eastern Syria.ADTalking about his efforts to counter Russia, the president also pointed to his success in persuading NATO members to increase their contributions to the transatlantic alliance. \u201cI raised $140 billion from NATO countries going up to $400 billion [over three years], and what\u2019s the purpose of NATO? Russia.\u201dTrump said that, thanks to his efforts, eight NATO allies are now meeting their NATO commitment to spend 2 percent of gross domestic product on defense. \u201cAnd by the way, 2 percent is too little,\u201d he said. \u201cI had some that were paying almost nothing, and now they\u2019re paying. And they asked me the big question: Would you leave if \u2014 and I said, \u2018Yeah, I would leave.\u2019 And if you don\u2019t give that answer, they\u2019re not going to pay.\u201dADBut does the president want to exit NATO? \u201cNo, I don\u2019t want to leave,\u201d Trump said. \u201cBut I want them to pay their fair share.\u201dADTrump recently announced that he is withdrawing nearly 10,000 U.S. troops from Germany. He told me that some of the troops will be going to Poland. \u201cTwo different locations, including Poland. I\u2019m also bringing some back home. I\u2019m bringing about half back home and half are going to different places that deserve it.\u201dThe president said that even though \u201cevery week, we put more sanctions on Russia,\u201d he and Russian President Vladimir Putin \u201cactually have a very good relationship.\u201d The two leaders are \u201ctrying to work out a nuclear arms treaty that\u2019s going to be a significant one. . . . There is no more important thing that we can do than nuclear arms control.\u201dI asked him about Russian support for the Taliban. Regardless of whether Russia actually paid bounties to kill U.S. troops, as has been reported, Russia is supporting the Taliban, which is killing Americans. Shouldn\u2019t Moscow be punished? \u201cI think Russia, the last thing they want is to get involved with Afghanistan,\u201d Trump said. \u201cOkay? The last thing they want. They were there for a long time. The Soviet Union became Russia because of Afghanistan, because they got beaten so badly in Afghanistan.\u201d With U.S. troops withdrawing (\u201cWe\u2019re almost out\u201d), the president said, his attitude is that if Russia wants to go back into Afghanistan, \u201cEnjoy yourselves.\u201dADADI asked Trump why he is so determined to withdraw completely from Afghanistan and Syria, as opposed to leaving a small counterterrorism force to train and enable local fighters and help them fight our enemies for us? Why the determination to get to zero? Trump didn\u2019t reply directly, saying: \u201cI\u2019m certainly not a globalist. And I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything wrong with saying that. I think globalists are not in vogue right now. Because when we were globalists, we were losing with everybody.\u201dOn the subject of China, Trump said that Chinese cyberoperations against the United States exceed those of the Russians, but it receives less attention because \u201cDemocrats and their donors and others, frankly, are all making a lot of money with China until I come along. Until the China flu came along, the China virus came along, until this happened, we were beating them so badly. It was incredible. That\u2019s why people say, \u2018Do you think it was an accident?\u2019 It was gross incompetence or something happened, but one thing they did, they let it escape the country. That\u2019s one thing they did. And it was a big change in many different ways, including political.\u201dThe president said that Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) have made his dealings with China more difficult. \u201cIf I make a deal and it\u2019s a phenomenal deal, let\u2019s say a trade deal with China, Schumer and Pelosi will say, \u2018It\u2019s a terrible deal.\u2019 They won\u2019t have ever seen the deal. If I say, \u2018No, you don\u2019t understand. China\u2019s giving us everything, they\u2019re giving us everything, and we can buy Beijing for one dollar,\u2019 they\u2019ll say, \u2018It\u2019s a terrible deal.\u2019 Anything you do is a terrible deal.\u201dADADThe \u201cautomatic\u201d opposition, he said, is \u201cstandard political. But it\u2019s so bad for the country.\u201dDoes Trump think it would change during a second term? Would Democrats be forced to cooperate if voters give him another four years? \u201cThe only way it\u2019s going to, we have to keep on winning. It was starting to change until we got hit with the China virus. It was starting to change. They were starting to come around toward the end. And then this happened. This changed things. And now they think they have a chance.\u201dNonetheless, Trump remains confident about November, thanks to \u201cthe greatest base in the history of politics. . . . Have you been watching the boats in Florida, all over the country? Thousands of boats every weekend. They have thousands of boats, and cycles, you know the bikers for Trump? They had a line last week, it went miles long, bikers for Trump, and they have the flags and the whole thing.\u201dADAD\u201cI love the country,\u201d Trump said, \u201cand so, despite all of the things I have to do, I just feel I have to do it right.\u201d Here is something he did right.

And the virus has yet to give up all its mysteries, creating uncertainty about when the pandemic might end.Support our journalism. Subscribe today.arrow-right1. How is this virus different?Unlike the coronavirus responsible for the 2002-2003 outbreak in Asia of severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, this new one can spread via people who are infected but haven\u2019t yet developed or won\u2019t develop symptoms. Researchers at the University of Oxford estimated in March that a third to half of transmissions occur from pre-symptomatic people. What\u2019s more, the new virus has a relatively long incubation incubation period -- the time between infection and the appearance of symptoms -- enabling it to move silently in a community before being detected. The interval is about five days for the coronavirus, compared with two days for the flu, which spreads the same way and is the most common cause of pandemics. The stealthy nature of the coronavirus wasn\u2019t well understood at first and contributed to the staggered and uneven quality of the response.ADADRead more: Why \u2018Silent Spreaders\u2019 Make Coronavirus Hard to Beat: QuickTake2. Why wasn\u2019t it contained?On Jan. 23, China imposed the most extensive quarantine in known history in Hubei province, where the outbreak began in the capital Wuhan, an industrial city of 11 million. By then, however, the virus had been seeded in other places in China and abroad. Starting in early February, travel bans were introduced between countries, but not before the virus had reached around the world. Governments locked down populations through stay-at-home orders and mandated \u201csocial distancing\u201d to \u201cflatten the curve\u201d of new infections, but the economic toll propelled reopenings that in some cases brought a surge in cases. It took months for some governments to recommend or mandate that people wear face masks in tight public spaces to counter the virus\u2019s silent spread.ADADRead more: Mask or No Mask? And Which Kind? What the Experts Say: QuickTakeRead more: Who\u2019s Succeeding Against the Coronavirus and Why: QuickTake3. What\u2019s the biggest mystery about the virus?A major question affecting how social-distancing protocols could be safely eased and people could feel more secure about returning to public spaces is whether those who get the coronavirus emerge with immunity to it. Generally speaking, infections prompt the body to develop antibodies that protect against reinfection, although there are notable exceptions, such as HIV and malaria. By mid-year a slew of test kits to detect antibodies to the coronavirus were available, including some that could be ordered online for taking at home. Many tests, however, weren\u2019t reliable. What\u2019s more, researchers still don\u2019t know whether the presence of antibodies means someone has immunity, or how long that protection might last. Concerns that infections might recur have been stoked by a small number of people testing positive for the virus sometimes weeks after their symptoms ended.ADADRead more: The Two Kinds of Virus Tests That Can Save Us. Or Not: QuickTake4. What are the other unanswered questions?\u2022 How deadly is it: Calculating the fatality rate in the midst of an outbreak is difficult because many cases go uncounted. Also, countries have different criteria for what deaths they include in their Covid-19 tallies. By mid-year, studies tended to converge on rates ranging from 0.5% to 1%. The higher figure would make Covid-19 10 times more lethal than seasonal flu, though the risk of dying varies greatly by age and is vastly higher for those with underlying illnesses. Apart from the scourge of HIV, which has stretched over four decades, this is poised to become the deadliest pandemic since the 1918 influenza that infected approximately a third of the world\u2019s population, killing an estimated 50 million people.ADAD\u2022 Is it seasonal?: In temperate climates, seasonal flu tends to flare in winter and recede as spring arrives. That gave rise to hopes that the arrival of warmer weather in the Northern Hemisphere would keep Covid-19 in check there. Some early evidence suggests higher temperatures slowed transmission of the coronavirus \u2014 but the effect was a modest one. Plus, a decline in summer could mean a surge in fall, as it does for flu.Read more: Does Warm Weather Curb Coronavirus? What Experts Say: QuickTake\u2022 What are all the ways it spreads?: It\u2019s clear people contract the coronavirus by coming into contact with virus-containing droplets emitted when an infected person coughs, sneezes, talks or just exhales normally, as with flu. The main risk is encountering these droplets directly from someone in close proximity. It\u2019s also possible to become infected by touching a contaminated surface and then the mouth, nose or eyes. One study concluded that the coronavirus can survive four hours on copper, 24 hours on cardboard, 48 hours on stainless steel and 72 hours on plastic. Researchers continue to investigate the theoretical risk that the coronavirus can spread through feces or in tiny airborne particles known as aerosols.ADADRead more: How Do People Catch the Coronavirus? What Experts Say: QuickTake\u2022 What circumstances are dangerous?: Evidence increasingly suggests that most people contract the virus via exposure to an infected person in an enclosed space for longer than a few moments. Spread of the virus in an outdoor environment appears to be relatively uncommon. Researchers have begun to conclude that so-called super-spreading events play an outsized role in the pandemic. These are episodes in which a single individual infects a cluster of people, for instance at a bar, a funeral or a choir practice.Read more: How Safe Is Flying in the Age of Coronavirus: QuickTakeAD\u2022 Where it came from: When the virus first emerged in early December in Wuhan, attention focused on a market where live animals were butchered and sold. Early cases not tied to the market suggest it wasn\u2019t where the virus originated but probably where it subsequently spread. The viral genome is closely related to several coronaviruses found in bats. Diseases transmissible from animals to humans, sometimes referred to as zoonoses, comprise a large percentage of all newly identified infectious diseases. U.S. and Chinese officials have traded accusations, though without evidence, that the other is responsible for releasing the virus.AD5. What have we learned about the virus?About 80% of cases have mild or no symptoms, 15% are severe and require oxygen, and 5% are critical, requiring ventilation, according to the World Health Organization. The elderly and those with underlying health issues, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, cardiovascular disease and obesity, are most at risk of developing a life-threatening illness. In the limited studies done by mid-year, those 65 and older have accounted for about 80% of deaths. The earliest recognized symptoms of Covid-19 were fever, dry cough and tiredness. Over time, the WHO added less common manifestations: aches and pains, nasal congestion, headache, conjunctivitis, sore throat, diarrhea, loss of taste or smell, a skin rash or discoloration of fingers or toes. Complications include failure of the respiratory and other vital systems, septic shock and blood-clotting disorders.ADWhat\u2019s next?ADThere are a few things to watch for:\u2022 New epicenters: Six months into the crisis, new cases were declining in most countries, yet still mostly rising in Latin America\u2019s largest economies.\u2022 A second wave: After restrictions in most places began to be lifted in May, authorities were on high alert for spikes, clusters of outbreaks or a full second wave. In the face of surging cases in early summer, some U.S. states began suspending or reversing reopenings to try to prevent swamped health systems.Read more: Why the World Worries About a Covid-19 \u2018Second Wave\u2019: QuickTake\u2022 Herd immunity: If prior illness provides protection against reinfection, once a sufficient percentage of people in a community catch it, so-called herd immunity can become established. That reduces the number of susceptible people to a level at which transmission slows and eventually stops. The same effect can be achieved through vaccination. The necessary percentage depends on the contagiousness of the pathogen. For the novel coronavirus, it\u2019s estimated to range from 55% to 82%. In the U.K. as of June, an estimated 5% of people had coronavirus antibodies. The figure was measured in May at 17% in London and 22.7% in New York City.ADAD\u2022 Better treatments: In late April, U.S. researchers announced that remdesivir, an experimental drug made by Gilead Sciences Inc., helped patients recover from Covid-19 more quickly than standard care. In June, the low-cost, anti-inflammatory dexamethasone improved survival in patients with Covid-19 in a study, becoming the first treatment to show life-saving promise. The search for additional treatments continues, with more than 100 under investigation.Read more: Where Are We in the Quest for Coronavirus Drugs: QuickTake\u2022 Vaccines: More than 130 experimental ones against the coronavirus are in development.

Subscribe today.arrow-right1. What\u2019s at stake?The Geneva-based WTO\u2019s mission of economic integration is under threat from protectionist policies around the globe, and without reform it risks being sidelined during the biggest economic crisis in a century. The world\u2019s largest economies agree that the organization must evolve to address the shifts in technology and the global trading system that have occurred since 1995. If members can align behind a candidate committed to modernization, it could break bureaucratic logjams and help unleash a wave of global growth at a time when it is needed most. If no such candidate can be found, the WTO risks further receding into irrelevance.ADAD2. What\u2019s precipitated the crisis?The WTO\u2019s appellate body, the main forum for settling worldwide trade disagreements, lost its ability in December 2019 to rule on new dispute cases. That resulted from a U.S. refusal over the previous two years to consider any nominees to fill vacancies on the panel. WTO members can still bring disputes to the trade body and receive an initial ruling, but that can be appealed into legal limbo. The U.S. imposition of hundreds of billions of dollars worth of tariffs against China, and use of the WTO\u2019s national security loophole to levy duties on steel and aluminum, have also weakened the organization.3. What is the WTO\u2019s selection process?ADThe chairman of the WTO General Council launched a selection procedure in June to confirm the trade body\u2019s next director-general. WTO members had sought to truncate the six-month process into just three in order to avoid a leadership vacuum in September, but it\u2019s likely a new candidate won\u2019t be selected until after the U.S. presidential election in November. During this time, the candidates will present themselves to the WTO\u2019s membership, campaign for support and sit for a question-and-answer session with the WTO General Council. Then the WTO\u2019s three highest-ranking delegates, known as \u201cthe troika,\u201d will consult with the membership and try to build a consensus around a final candidate.AD4. Who is running?\u2022 Jesus Seade Kuri, Mexico\u2019s chief negotiator of USMCA and a former WTO deputy director-generalAD\u2022 Hamid Mamdouh, an Egyptian attorney at King & Spalding LLP and former services division director at the WTO\u2022 Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, Nigeria\u2019s former finance minister and former managing director of the World Bank\u2022 Tudor Ulianovschi, Moldova\u2019s former minister of foreign affairs.\u2022 Yoo Myung-hee, South Korea\u2019s trade minister.5. Who\u2019s not?\u2022 EU Trade Commissioner Phil Hogan\u2022 Former EU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom\u2022 Canadian Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland\u2022 Dutch Foreign Trade Minister Sigrid Kaag6. What credentials are required?WTO rules require candidates to have \u201cextensive experience in international relations, encompassing economic, trade and/or political experience; a firm commitment to the work and objectives of the WTO; proven leadership and managerial ability; and demonstrated communications skills.\u201dADAD7. What kind of leader are nations looking for?Governments hope the next WTO director-general can persuade members to complete the much-needed reform of the organization. Trade officials in Geneva broadly argue that Azevedo\u2019s successor should have sufficient leadership authority and capability to marshal broad support around the WTO\u2019s reform agenda. That means strong consideration should be given to candidates who have, at the very least, some experience as a minister.8. Is there a nationality requirement?No. However, trade officials from the U.S., EU and Canada say the next WTO director-general should come from a developed country due to their belief that the organization\u2019s leadership should rotate between developed and developing countries. Not all delegates agree on this, however, and representatives from African nations argue that it\u2019s their continent\u2019s turn to take on the top mantle of the WTO.ADAD9. Should a woman lead the WTO?There is a strong push among Geneva trade delegates to select a woman to lead the WTO for the first time. However, free-trade advocates like Wendy Cutler, vice president of the Washington-based Asia Society Policy Institute, argue that WTO members should try to avoid placing gender constraints on the selection process.10. Are there any other considerations?The candidate must also thread a narrow diplomatic needle that displeases neither the U.S. nor China, whose bitter conflict over the pandemic is testing their fragile economic truce. The Trump administration has actively sought to undermine the WTO\u2019s ability to function, saying it has infringed on American sovereignty and enabled China to become a big economic player globally at the expense of U.S. jobs and manufacturing. Adding to the unpredictability factor, President Donald Trump -- who has called the WTO the worst trade deal the U.S. has ever signed -- is up for re-election in November, so America\u2019s tolerance for a candidate who looks too favorably on China might be tested. Meanwhile, China has engaged in a multi-year campaign to expand its diplomatic influence by installing key personnel at the top levels of international decision making bodies.11. What happens if no candidate is selected?One of the WTO\u2019s four deputy directors-general may serve as an interim caretaker if the WTO\u2019s members cannot agree on a consensus nominee by Sept. 1. They are Yonov Frederick Agah of Nigeria, Karl Brauner of Germany, Alan Wolff of the U.S. and Yi Xiaozhun of China.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P.", "comment": "0 Comments", "topic": "Business"}, {"cover": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/DZIN3HGDQUI6VNHWZM443CKA7M.jpghttps://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/DZIN3HGDQUI6VNHWZM443CKA7M.jpg", "title": "Biden finds a better way to do \u2018America First\u2019", "date": "Jul 16, 2020", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/biden-finds-a-better-way-to-do-america-first/2020/07/16/b0eafa20-c79f-11ea-b037-f9711f89ee46_story.html", "keyword": "China and the world order", "website": "the Washington Post", "author": "Fareed Zakaria", "content": "With the pandemic overshadowing everything, one can sometimes forget that there is a presidential campaign going on. That helps to explain why the media paid so little attention, over the past two weeks, when Joe Biden released his plans to fight climate change and revive the economy. The climate change plan is ambitious and forward-thinking, but more interesting is the economic plan, which promises \u201cto ensure the future is \u2018made in all of America.\u2019\u2009\u201d That sounds like an America First agenda, and sure enough, President Trump accused Biden of stealing his ideas. But in fact, while the plan is politically clever in moving directly onto Trump\u2019s turf of economic nationalism, it is much better than the president\u2019s approach.First and most important is what the plan does not do. It is not a mercantilist call for tariffs and trade wars, hallmarks of the Trump presidency. These Trump policies have failed by any measure. The evidence is so clear that when Biden released a fiery ad saying Trump \u201clost\u201d the trade war with China, Politifact\u2019s only quibble with that claim was it should have been present tense \u201closing.\u201d The group pointed to the following studies from 2019: a Federal Reserve report that determined the tariffs \u201chave not boosted manufacturing employment or output, even as they increased producer prices\u201d; a Moody\u2019s analysis finding that the trade war had cost 300,000 U.S. jobs; and a Federal Reserve study assessing the cost of these tariffs to the average American household at about $800 per year, erasing the benefits of the Trump tax cut. Oxford Economics estimated the trade war shaved 0.3 percent off U.S. gross domestic product growth last year.Support our journalism. Subscribe today.arrow-rightThe Biden plan\u2019s boldest idea is to massively ramp up investment in research and development. Biden proposes raising spending by $300 billion over four years, which represents a 60 percent increase over 2018 spending. If enacted, this would reverse the steady decline in federal investment in science and technology since its heyday in the 1950s and 1960s. (To get to those levels would still require hundreds of billions more.) Those investments led to the personal computer, the Internet, the Global Positioning System and a host of other technologies that have transformed the economy. More recently, it is worth remembering, an Energy Department loan of $465 million is what enabled Tesla to establish itself and experiment with electric cars. The Biden plan proposes investments in 5G technology, electric cars, lightweight materials and artificial intelligence. Some of this money will be wasted \u2014 as also happens to investments from venture capital firms \u2014 but all you need is for some, like Tesla, to succeed big.ADADThe plan also has a $400 billion \u201cBuy American\u201d component. The theory behind this is sensible. But the danger of this kind of approach is that it can too often become \u201cindustrial policy,\u201d with the government trying to revive bygone industries like steel (as Biden wants to do) and favoring firms with the best lobbyists. More generally, the track record of most rich countries in practicing industrial policy has been pretty bad. Experts used to point to Japan as the country that had mastered government-directed investment, except that it turned out that Japan\u2019s best companies all came out of its fiercely competitive private sector. The state-sponsored ones mostly did poorly. (China is different because its biggest advantage is not smart government investments but low wages.)The best model is not for government to set up or subsidize specific companies or industries, but to let the market know that it will buy certain kinds of innovative products, which then gives the private sector an incentive to produce them. As late as 1962, the U.S. government was responsible for purchasing 100 percent of all semiconductor chips produced in the country, which is what allowed that industry to become viable. Similarly, NASA orders powerfully helped the computer industry in the 1960s. Biden rightly wants to emulate this approach to support today\u2019s breakthrough technologies, though key agencies in the federal government in those days were more efficient and operated with far greater insulation from special interests.A final caution: \u201cBuy American\u201d has been around for a long time. In fact, it was initiated in 1933, on the last day of Herbert Hoover\u2019s term in office, responding to a \u201cBuy British\u201d plan announced in London. The result of these kinds of moves sent the world into a downward spiral of protectionism and nationalism, impoverishing ordinary people, and creating a dangerous international climate.

He\u2019d vanquished more than a dozen opponents, however messily, upending the party establishment and sending experienced politicians into retirement. That night was a celebration of his victory \u2014 one deliberately tailored to his ego. It was constrained as he wanted it to be constrained and excessive the way he wanted it to be excessive. A forest of American flags were perfectly aligned at the back of the stage under a massive screen that at one point said nothing more than exactly what Trump would have wanted it to: Trump.Support our journalism. Subscribe today.arrow-rightIn that moment, it seemed unlikely that Trump's campaign would end successfully. He trailed Hillary Clinton relatively narrowly, but history suggested that his insurgent campaign would founder as the election approached. Despite his assertively unapologetic primary campaign, it seemed fair to expect that the speech he gave on that evening would attempt to establish a general-election campaign aimed at broadening his base.ADADIt didn\u2019t. The speech Trump gave four years ago Tuesday was, like so many other parts of Trump\u2019s campaign, dark, angry, deceptive and aimed at riling up the people who already supported his candidacy. He offered a slew of projections and promises that, four years later, seem as bizarre and unlikely as they did then. Importantly, he detailed an approach to the job that seemed dissonant at the time but has been an undercurrent ever since.And, of course, he promised that he alone could fix the problems the nation faced. In November, voters will be asked to evaluate how he did.The speech began as one might expect. Trump formally accepted the nomination and then celebrated having received more primary votes than any previous Republican nominee. It was an accomplishment boosted both by high turnout, the relatively small number of prior candidates in the modern era and the expansion of the population of the United States. But it was a metric that could be parlayed into a victory lap, and so it was.ADADThose niceties complete, Trump offered a concise summary of his thesis.\u201cTogether, we will lead our party back to the White House, and we will lead our country back to safety, prosperity and peace,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will be a country of generosity and warmth. But we will also be a country of law and order.\u201dThere had been two events in the preceding several weeks that amplified that latter message. In mid-June, a man claiming loyalty to the Islamic State entered a gay nightclub in Orlando and killed more than 50 people. A few weeks later, a man in Dallas shot and killed five police officers as a Black Lives Matter protest was happening nearby.To Trump, these weren\u2019t isolated acts of violence. They were evidence of a deep-seated danger.AD\u201cOur convention occurs at a moment of crisis for our nation,\u201d Trump continued. \u201cThe attacks on our police, and the terrorism in our cities, threaten our very way of life. Any politician who does not grasp this danger is not fit to lead our country.\u201dADHe offered the country a promise.\u201cI have a message for all of you: The crime and violence that today afflicts our nation will soon \u2014 and I mean very soon \u2014 come to an end,\u201d he said. \u201cBeginning on January 20th, 2017, safety will be restored.\u201dTo many observers in the moment, it was a bit perplexing. Beyond the aforementioned incidents, it didn\u2019t seem as though there was any particularly chaotic situation in the country. But it served Trump\u2019s purposes to suggest that there was and that it demanded an immediate solution, so a speech that might have been expected to be an effort to embrace Democrats was instead largely a warning about what Democrats had wrought.ADThe pattern Trump used in elevating the issue of crime was the pattern he used over and over throughout the rest of his speech. Present and exaggerate a problem, often using cherry-picked statistics. Insist that he \u2014 and only he \u2014 could and would quickly bring it to an end. His infamous \u201cI alone can fix it\u201d comment that came later in the speech referred somewhat narrowly to what he presented as a thorough corruption in Washington. While the line has been regularly offered out of that context, as we did above, the sentiment it encapsulates was pervasive.ADIt\u2019s hard not to consider Trump\u2019s focus on crime and danger outside the context of the current moment. Trump\u2019s reelection campaign has produced ads warning that his presumptive 2020 opponent, former vice president Joe Biden, would preside over similarly dangerous times should he win in November. To make that point, Trump\u2019s campaign repeatedly highlights recent acts of violence \u2014 violence that, of course, has occurred under Trump.Four years ago, he isolated a few data points to suggest a country growing more dangerous. He noted increases in homicides in large cities, including Chicago and Washington, something he attributed to the Obama administration\u2019s \u201crollback of criminal enforcement.\u201d That violent crime had reached 40-year lows under President Barack Obama went unmentioned.ADIn his first two years in office, the only two for which data are complete, the violent crime rate didn\u2019t drop below the low point seen under Obama. It didn\u2019t even match that low.ADTrump also revisited the theme that probably earned him the nomination in the first place.\u201cThe number of new illegal immigrant families who have crossed the border so far this year already exceeds the entire total from 2015,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are being released by the tens of thousands into our communities with no regard for the impact on public safety or resources.\u201dHe then told a story about a young woman who was killed by an undocumented immigrant, something that would become a staple of his speeches as president.ADWhen Trump similarly focused on immigration during his speech announcing his candidacy the prior June, his announcement was viewed as a lark. So his accusations that immigrants from Mexico were criminals and rapists led to a private-sector blowback, with business partners cutting ties with the Trump Organization and its chief executive. That, though, elevated awareness of Trump\u2019s fiercely anti-immigrant campaign rhetoric, rhetoric that matched what conservative media outlets had been telling Republican voters but that Republican elected officials avoided both as a political calculation and, well, because it was largely false.ADTrump\u2019s speech at the convention was one of a few he has given over the past five years that deliberately tried to remain within the boundaries of accuracy, territory in which Trump isn\u2019t always comfortable. (\u201cI will present the facts plainly and honestly,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe cannot afford to be so politically correct anymore.\u201d) Doing so meant making a relatively unremarkable situation on the border seem alarming. The number of apprehensions at the border in 2015 was also near a 40-year low. But the number of families apprehended was higher, so Trump focused on that.After Trump took office, the number of families apprehended at the southern border first declined and then soared, pushing total apprehensions to levels not seen in decades. This was the catalyst for Trump\u2019s national-emergency declaration aimed at building a wall on the border, and thereby upholding a promise he made repeatedly in 2016, including during that speech. The number of family apprehensions soon declined (well before the wall was actually built), but the national emergency remains.ADTrump then turned his attention to the economy.ADUnder Obama, the Great Recession, which began in 2008, ended and the nation slowly began to regain steam. Again, though, Trump cherry-picked numbers, this time highlighting data points aimed at appealing to nonwhite listeners.\u201cNearly 4 in 10 African American children are living in poverty,\u201d Trump said, \u201cwhile 58 percent of African American youth are now not employed. Two million more Latinos are in poverty today than when President Obama took his oath of office less than eight years ago.\u201dThat figure about African American youth is misleading, as The Washington Post has repeatedly documented. It includes anyone who isn\u2019t working at all \u2014 including students or others not actually looking for jobs. In 2019, by comparison, 76 percent of black Americans younger than 20 were unemployed. By pegging the Hispanic poverty level to the day Obama took office, Trump\u2019s rhetoric benefited from the fact that poverty levels lagged the economic crisis, meaning that the number of people in poverty grew after the recession ended.ADADIn 2018, it\u2019s estimated that the rate of poverty among black children had fallen to about 30 percent. Where that figure stands in the current economic climate is unknown.Trump also criticized Obama for the trade deficit in goods (which grew under Trump) and for increasing the national debt to more than $19 trillion. (It\u2019s now more than $26 trillion.)\u201cAnd yet, what do we have to show for it?\u201d Trump asked. \u201cOur roads and bridges are falling apart, our airports are Third World condition, and 43 million Americans are on food stamps.\u201dThat latter figure fell to about 36 million last year. The promised infrastructure improvements, though, failed to materialize.After a brief riff on foreign policy, rattling off a number of Fox News-friendly accusations against Obama and Clinton (including a pointed mention of the 2012 attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya), he pivoted to his proposals.\u201cThe problems we face now \u2014 poverty and violence at home, war and destruction abroad \u2014 will last only as long as we continue relying on the same politicians who created them in the first place,\u201d Trump said. \u201cA change in leadership is required to get a change in outcomes. Tonight, I will share with you my plan of action for America.\u201cThe most important difference between our plan and that of our opponent is that our plan will put America first,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAmericanism, not globalism, will be our credo.\u201dThat included an overhaul of trade policy. Voters who supported Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) would \u201cjoin our movement,\u201d Trump predicted, \u201cbecause we will fix his biggest single issue: trade deals that strip our country of our jobs and strip us of our wealth as a country.\u201dSanders supporters overwhelmingly voted for Clinton. Beyond killing the Trans-Pacific Partnership, Trump\u2019s main trade achievement was replacing the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with the U.S.-Canada-Mexico Agreement \u2014 which is mostly just an update to NAFTA.Some of the most jarring comments from Trump\u2019s speech center on race.\u201cThe irresponsible rhetoric of our president, who has used the pulpit of the presidency to divide us by race and color, has made America a more dangerous environment for everyone than, frankly, I have ever seen and anybody in this room has ever watched or seen,\u201d Trump said.Obama\u2019s administration had \u201cfailed America\u2019s inner cities,\u201d he said, using his preferred shorthand for black Americans.\u201cIt\u2019s failed them on education,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt\u2019s failed them on jobs. It\u2019s failed them on crime. It\u2019s failed them on every single level.\u201d\u201cWhen I am president, I will work to ensure that all of our kids are treated equally, and protected equally,\u201d he insisted. \u201cEvery action I take, I will ask myself: Does this make life better for young Americans in Baltimore, in Chicago, in Detroit, in Ferguson, who have as much of a right to live out their dreams as any other child in America?\u201dThis is presumably part of the \u201cgenerosity and warmth\u201d Trump insisted would be part of his presidency. It can be judged as a promise on its own merits.Trump then switched to the issue of terrorism. He pledged to eradicate the Islamic State, the last territorial vestiges of which were eliminated in early 2019. He also pledged to stamp out \u201cIslamic terrorism\u201d more broadly, insisting that the United States would \u201cwin fast.\u201dTo that end, he reiterated his pledge to \u201csuspend immigration from any nation that has been compromised by terrorism until such time as proven vetting mechanisms have been put in place.\u201d\u201cWe don\u2019t want them in our country,\u201d he added off the cuff.As president, Trump did implement multiple versions of his travel ban, after moderating it to be less specifically about adherents of Islam.His speech then pivoted back to immigration, looping the acceptance of refugees from conflict-ridden areas such as Syria in with immigrants crossing into the United States illegally.\u201cWe are going to be considerate and compassionate to everyone,\u201d he said. \u201cBut my greatest compassion will be for our own struggling citizens.\u201d Another pattern: I will be nice, but, more important, I will be tough.He has been the latter, at least. As president, Trump sharply reduced refugee immigration into the country. He moved to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which offered those who\u2019d come to the United States illegally as children a way to remain here legally.Trump accused Clinton of supporting policies that offered economic advantages to immigrants over U.S.-born workers, bringing him back to the economy.\u201cI have made billions of dollars in business making deals \u2014 now I\u2019m going to make our country rich again,\u201d he said. He promised new trade deals (see above) as well as a battery of other proposals.But governing is trickier than orating. For example, Trump said he would \u201cbring our jobs back to Ohio and Pennsylvania and New York and Michigan and all of America.\u201d Because of the coronavirus pandemic, the number of people working in each of those states is lower than when Trump took office. In fact, it\u2019s lower than when Obama took office.At another point, he promised he would \u201cnever, ever sign bad trade deals.\u201d Trump has expressed frustration about the parameters of the preliminary trade deal he signed with China.On other economic points, Trump hit closer to the mark. He promised massive tax cuts, which he delivered \u2014 although his pledge that \u201cmiddle-income Americans will experience profound relief\u201d doesn\u2019t capture what happened, and his pledge to simplify filing was abandoned.\u201cWe will repeal and replace disastrous Obamacare,\u201d Trump said at another point. \u201cYou will be able to choose your own doctor again.\u201dAn effort to replace the Affordable Care Act, better known as Obamacare, failed in the summer of 2017. Congress did repeal the individual coverage mandate it included as part of the aforementioned tax law, but as recently as Sunday, Trump was still promising that his administration would soon reveal a full replacement to the law.He promised to help relieve student debt, which didn\u2019t happen. He promised to rebuild the military, which he often insists he did. He promised to provide veterans with the ability to choose their own doctor or hospital, something Obama had already done. He promised to get rid of the Johnson Amendment, which limits the ability of religious institutions to weigh in on politics. He says he did this, but he didn\u2019t.After more than an hour and after recognizing his family both present and departed, Trump reached his conclusion.\u201cHistory is watching us now,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s waiting to see if we will rise to the occasion, and if we will show the whole world that America is still free and independent and strong. I\u2019m asking for your support tonight so that I can be your champion in the White House.\u201dHe ended with the now-familiar refrain: \u201cWe will Make America Great Again!\u201dBut his actual conclusion, the moment in which he most fully summarized his feelings in the moment, came a bit before that, as he was winding up to the soaring rhetoric plugged into his teleprompter.\u201cRemember: All of the people telling you that you can\u2019t have the country you want are the same people that wouldn\u2019t stand\u201d \u2014 a brief stumble \u2014 \u201cI mean, they said Trump doesn\u2019t have a chance of being here tonight,\u201d Trump said, ad-libbing. \u201cNot a chance! The same people. Oh, we love defeating those people, don\u2019t we? Love it, love it, love it.\u201dThat was what Trump was there to celebrate. A few minutes later, he was onstage with wife Melania Trump and Mike and Karen Pence, and balloons were falling and people were shouting and clapping and hurrahing at the four of them and their families.It\u2019s hard to imagine that Trump has enjoyed any moment more in the four years since.", "comment": "17 Comments", "topic": "Politics"}, {"cover": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ZWSCFHGGWII6VKBFQ4RAATSBKA.jpghttps://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ZWSCFHGGWII6VKBFQ4RAATSBKA.jpg", "title": "American diplomacy must again ground itself in the nation\u2019s founding principles", "date": "Jul 16, 2020", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/07/16/pompeo-oped-commission-unalienable-rights/", "keyword": "China and the world order", "website": "the Washington Post", "author": "", "content": "Michael R. Pompeo is U.S. secretary of state.To secure freedom at home and abroad, Americans must rightly understand the nation\u2019s founding principles. That\u2019s why, last year, I convened the State Department\u2019s Commission on Unalienable Rights. I asked its members not to make policy, but to elaborate the principles through which we can ground America\u2019s commitment to championing human rights in our enduring dedication to unalienable rights and our tradition of constitutional self-government.Support our journalism. Subscribe today.arrow-rightAfter almost a year of work, the commission releases its report to the public Thursday at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia. Some say the report\u2019s timing couldn\u2019t be worse. I say the timing couldn\u2019t be better.ADNever before have America\u2019s founding principles been under such relentless assault. For decades, our institutions of higher education have sought to debunk or disown them. Last summer, the New York Times  launched the 1619 Project, which contends that the essence of America is entwined with slavery and racism. In recent weeks, justified outrage at the actions of a rogue Minneapolis policeman has given way to outrageous efforts to erase American history by tearing down statues of our nation\u2019s founders.ADNever has knowledge of our founding principles been more urgent. As President Trump has recognized, we face many mighty challenges from abroad. Ruled with an iron fist by the Chinese Communist Party, for instance, China seeks to remake the world in its autocratic image and subordinate other nations to its hegemonic ambitions. We can\u2019t confront Beijing or other gross human rights violators throughout the world without understanding the roots of our foreign policy, though the lens of our Founders\u2019 intent.Just when unity of purpose is called for, confusion sweeps the land about the convictions that undergird our great experiment in ordered liberty. Some of our best-educated and most highly credentialed citizens have lost sight of the fundamental difference between autocracies, which subordinate the individual to the will of a dictator, and liberal democracies, whose overriding purpose \u2014 notwithstanding their inevitable shortcomings and constant need for vigilance and reform \u2014 is to enable individuals, families and communities to flourish.ADFreedom has always been at the center of the American political order. The Declaration of Independence proclaims that every human being is endowed with certain unalienable rights, such as life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness; that governments are instituted to secure these rights; and that all legitimate power springs from the consent of the governed. The Constitution structures our fundamental political institutions to provide the energy and flexibility to secure rights while circumscribing the exercise of political power to prevent government from violating rights. And the American political tradition records the continuing struggle to honor the nation\u2019s founding promise.ADFreedom has always been at the center of American diplomacy. In the republic\u2019s early years, Presidents George Washington and Thomas Jefferson urged the nation to protect the American people\u2019s freedom by avoiding, in Jefferson\u2019s words, \u201centangling alliances.\u201d In 1823, President James Monroe declared that to safeguard liberty and individual rights at home, the nation must protect the Western Hemisphere from the unfree forms of government that then characterized Europe.Two years earlier, his secretary of state, John Quincy Adams, asserted in a July 4 address that the United States speaks \u201cthe language of equal liberty, of equal justice, and of equal rights. . . . But she goes not abroad, in search of monsters to destroy. She is the well-wisher to the freedom and independence of all. She is the champion and vindicator of her own.\u201d ADThe 19th and 20th centuries brought great changes. Two world wars and successive revolutions in transportation and communications shrank the globe, leaving nations vastly more interconnected and interdependent. The United States was compelled to revise its diplomacy, the better to honor its founding principles. In 1948, the U.N. General Assembly, with the United States taking a leading role, passed the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Although it inspired human rights treaties to which the United States is signatory, the UDHR is not itself binding law. Rather, it establishes \u201ca common standard of achievement for all peoples and all nations.\u201d ADSince 1948, presidents of both parties have insisted that the United States must champion human rights abroad. But hard questions abound: What is the connection between the nation\u2019s constitutional system and its international obligations? How do we apply old rights to new circumstances and assess the validity of new rights claims? How do we balance the commitment to champion human rights with diplomacy\u2019s complex and multifarious demands?By recovering our nation\u2019s founding principles \u2014 and elaborating them in that spirit of toleration and civility on which constitutional government depends \u2014 the State Department\u2019s Commission on Unalienable Rights enables the nation to better answer these always-pressing questions and thereby makes an important contribution to securing freedom. I encourage everyone to read its fine work.ADWatch Opinions videos:Read more:Read a letter in response to this piece: Mike Pompeo has shown us his dubious \u2018principles\u2019Rori Kramer: Mike Pompeo wants to nationalize human rightsZeid Ra\u2019ad Al Hussein: Human rights are not a luxuryKenneth Roth: We can beat the virus only by protecting human rightsThe Post\u2019s View: Why redefine U.S. policy on human rights?Alexandra Petri: Do these human rights spark joy?", "comment": "1.9k Comments", "topic": "Opinions"}, {"cover": "", "title": "\u2018E Pluribus Unum\u2019 Is a Cruel Mirage", "date": "Jul 13, 2020", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/e-pluribus-unum-is-a-cruel-mirage/2020/07/13/823c7eca-c500-11ea-a825-8722004e4150_story.html", "keyword": "China and the world order", "website": "the Washington Post", "author": "", "content": "Anyone who navigates America\u2019s socioeconomic data is accustomed to charts that break out the country\u2019s general population into its component racial and ethnic groups.More often than not, the disparities illustrated are startling.Support our journalism. Subscribe today.arrow-rightFor instance, although in 2016 America\u2019s national infant mortality rate was 5.9 per 1,000 live births, the rate for non-Hispanic Black people was 11.4\u00a0\u2014 which is more than double the rate for non-Hispanic White people (4.9), and more than triple that of Asian Americans (3.6).Less often visualized is how these disparities stack up internationally. In many cases, the domestic divisions within the U.S. are so great as to render America\u2019s various racial and ethnic groups as distinctly as separate countries.ADCharted below are six data sets that track the human journey from cradle to grave. They illustrate the very real, inherently interconnected, and profoundly consequential impact of race and ethnicity on the American dream.ADSome notes on the data: First, although where possible the U.S. data are taken from a single official source, agencies vary in how they report racial and ethnic groups. Second, international organizations, such as the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, aggregate data from national sources with divergent reporting schedules and methodologies. Third, I have occasionally eschewed the most recent data in favor of slightly earlier figures when, as with infant mortality, they are more complete or when, as with unemployment, they represent more stable pre-coronavirus trends. Fourth, I have tried to select countries that shed light on the U.S. data, either because they are economically similar, or because they represent illuminating outliers. So some of these charts may best be read as broad-brush indicators rather than exact comparisons.Infant MortalityADThe infant mortality rate is the number of deaths before the age of one year, for every 1,000 live births. Because such deaths are influenced by a broad range of socioeconomic factors \u2014\u00a0health care, income, diet, education, housing, pollution, sanitation, etc. \u2014 the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention calls the rate \u201can important marker of the overall health of a society.\u201dADAs the chart below illustrates, U.S. non-Hispanic Black infant mortality in 2016 was 16 times that of Iceland, worse than Turkey and only marginally better than Mexico. In comparison, U.S. Asian infant mortality was lower than Canada and the U.K., and on a par with Switzerland.The United States ranked 13th out of 76 international education systems in reading literacy, according to the latest (2018) triennial survey of 15-year-olds\u2019 educational abilities by the OECD\u2019s Program for International Student Assessment.ADPISA defines reading literacy as \u201cstudents\u2019 capacity to understand, use, evaluate, reflect on, and engage with texts in order to achieve one\u2019s goals; develop one\u2019s knowledge and potential; and participate in society\u201d \u2014 all of which are clearly prerequisites for advancement in a highly technical world.ADHowever, as the chart below demonstrates, \u00ad\u00ad\u00adinternational comparisons with the U.S. cohort are striking. U.S. Asian students topped the global ranking \u2014\u00a0outperforming even Singapore and China (as represented by the provinces Beijing, Shanghai, Jiangsu and Zhejiang). In contrast, U.S. Black students, ranking between Chile and Serbia, were 39 points below the OECD average, and 108 points below U.S. Asian students. These figures are even more remarkable if you consider that just 215 points differentiate the highest-scoring country, China (555), and the lowest, the Philippines (340).UnemploymentADThe impact of Covid-19 on unemployment in America (and many other countries) has been so dramatic that the spike is likely to be a y-axis landmark on fever charts for generations to come.In December 2019, before the pandemic hit, U.S. unemployment was at a 50-year low of 3.5% \u2014\u00a02.5% for Asians, 3.2% for White people, 4.2% for Hispanics and 5.9% for African Americans. In April 2020, the unemployment rate rocketed to 14.7% \u2014\u00a014.2% percent for Whites, 14.5% for Asians, 16.7% percent for African Americans, and 18.9% for Hispanics.ADAlthough the latest June jobs report offers glimmers of hope \u2014\u00a0the unemployment rate fell to 11.1% and the number of those on temporary layoff fell by 4.8 million \u2014 the number of permanent job losses continued to grow, increasing by 588,000 to 2.9 million.ADBecause of such whiplash fluctuations \u2014\u00a0and because governments around the world are experimenting with complex job-protection and furlough schemes \u2014\u00a0I have illustrated the racial and ethnic inequalities within American unemployment using the annual international rates for 2019. That year, unemployment for Asian Americans was on a par with Japan, whereas U.S. Black people or [j1]\u00a0African Americans had an unemployment rate similar to Lithuania.Affordable HealthcareThe percentage of Americans without any form of health insurance has fallen in recent years \u2014\u00a0from 15.4% in 1997 to 9.4% in 2018 \u2014\u00a0thanks in great part to the 2010 Affordable Care Act.ADADThat said, the risk of inadequate or nonexistent access to healthcare remains high and falls unequally across race and ethnicity. In 2018, 30.4 million Americans were uninsured: 8.1% of Asians, 9% of non-Hispanic Whites, 15.2% of non-Hispanic Black people, and 26.7% of Hispanic or Latino persons.Sadly, Covid-19\u2019s impact on unemployment will likely threaten what advances in coverage have been made in recent years, since more than half the U.S. population receives health insurance through an employer. This conjunction, in turn, is likely to affect both the number and social impact of Covid-19 fatalities since, as the CDC notes, \u201cage-adjusted hospitalization rates [for Coronavirus] are highest among non-Hispanic American Indian or Alaska Native and non-Hispanic black persons, followed by Hispanic or Latino persons.\u201dThe precarious healthcare of so many millions of Americans comes into sharper focus when set against other advanced economies where the risks of being uninsured or suffering \u201cmedical bankruptcy\u201d simply don\u2019t arise.ADADObesityAmerica\u2019s obesity epidemic is well known. According to the CDC, from 1999-2000 through 2017-2018, the age-adjusted prevalence of obesity (defined as a Body Mass Index \u2265 30) leapt from 30.5% to 42.4%, and severe obesity (BMI \u226540) from 4.7% to 9.2%.Less well known are the social, economic, market and psychological forces that contribute to this epidemic \u2014\u00a0from the impact of income, education and pollution to the promotion of junk food and the prevalence of food deserts. Dismissing obesity as poor choices made by poor people makes little sense if President Donald Trump himself is obese. Furthermore, similar forces seem to be at play in America\u2019s contrapuntal nutrition crisis: In 2018, some 37 million Americans went hungry, and 14.3 million households suffered food insecurity.ADAccording to 2016 World Health Organization data, America is the 12th most obese country in the world, below an archipelago of Pacific Island States and Kuwait. Within this ranking, however, America\u2019s racial and ethnic divisions are stark: Non-Hispanic Asians (25% less obese than the domestic average) rank better than Switzerland; whereas non-Hispanic Black women (14.5% more obese than the domestic average, and the heaviest U.S. cohort) rank just below the most obese country in the world, Nauru \u2014\u00a0which the BBC called \u201ca speck in the Pacific about 3,000 km northeast of Australia with 10,000 citizens and little economy.\u201dADSuch troubling statistics have recently acquired additional urgency, as links emerge between rates of obesity and hospitalizations for Covid-19.Life expectancy for all Americans has, unsurprisingly, improved over the generations \u2014\u00a0especially for women. A boy born in 1900 could expect to live until 46.3, and a girl to 48.3; by 2017, these had leapt to 76.1 and 86.1, respectively.Although racial inequalities in American life expectancy have also improved over the years (to the extent that the data are comparable), they remain significant. A White child born in 1900 could expect to live to 47.6, and a non-White child to 33 (a gap of 14.6 years); in 2017, a White child could expect to live until 78.8, and a non-Hispanic Black child to 74.9 (a gap of 3.9 years). (The term \u201cnonwhite\u201d is itself interesting: until 1970, official U.S. data counted only \u201cwhites\u201d and \u201cothers.\u201d)ADIn 2017, the average Hispanic boy could expect to live to 79.1, and girl to 84.3; compare this to 76.4 and 81.2 for Whites, and 71.5 and 78.1 for non-Hispanic Black people.Because the official United States Life Tables for 2017 do not provide racial or ethnic details beyond these groupings, I have relied on the 2006-2010 estimates published in 2015 by Francesco Acciai, et al. for the overall life expectancy of U.S. Asians: 86.3 years.America\u2019s domestic disparities are further illuminated when set against an international backdrop. As the chart below shows, whereas U.S. Hispanics live longer than Brits or Germans, non-Hispanic Black men have a lower life expectancy than the average Latvian or Russian person. U.S. Black men, however, do have a higher life expectancy than Russian males (67.5 years).From birth to \u00ad\u00ad\u00addeath, and at every stage of life therein, an American\u2019s race and ethnicity will help define which America they inhabit: one of the most advanced countries, or one still struggling with development.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com/opinion\u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P.", "comment": "0 Comments", "topic": "Business"}, {"cover": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/S633T6WLOEI6VGNQQQTOE3JAHM.jpghttps://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/S633T6WLOEI6VGNQQQTOE3JAHM.jpg", "title": "A Guide to Democrats\u2019 Plans to Tax the Rich More", "date": "Jul 23, 2020", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/a-guide-to-democrats-plans-to-tax-the-rich-more/2020/07/21/98af6e52-cb71-11ea-99b0-8426e26d203b_story.html", "keyword": "China and the world order", "website": "the Washington Post", "author": "", "content": "The U.S. Democratic Party, pulled to the left by its self-described progressive wing, is percolating with ideas on how to make the richest Americans pay more in taxes.

Biden would end a provision that allows people to pass capital gains to heirs without tax after death. Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, in his unsuccessful campaign against Biden for the Democratic nomination, proposed expanding the estate tax so it covers holdings left at death by the wealthiest 0.2% of Americans, applying a rate of as much as 77% on the value of estates above $1 billion.\u2022 TAX CAPITAL GAINS like ordinary income. Investors are taxed on the difference between what they paid for a stock or property and what they sold it for. The federal rate in the U.S. currently tops out at 20%, well below the top marginal rate of 37% on wages and salaries. Biden would tax capital gains the same as regular income for taxpayers earning more than $1 million annually.AD\u2022 KILL TAX BREAKS. Biden has called for ending so-called like-kind exchanges, a tax maneuver popular among real-estate investors, to finance his plan to expand care for children and the elderly.AD2. What do Democrats other than Biden propose?Taxing wealth in addition to income, for one. Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, whose unsuccessful campaign for the presidential nomination drove much of the discussion about taxing the rich, proposed a 2% annual tax on household wealth in excess of $50 million, rising to 6% on every dollar above $1 billion. Sanders proposed a 1% tax on households worth at least $32 million that graduates to an 8% levy on wealth above $10 billion. Also unlike Biden, Warren and Sanders proposed taxing financial trades. Sanders proposed a tax of 0.5% on stock trades, 0.1% on bond trades and 0.005% on derivatives transactions. Warren was among the other candidates who called for a 0.1% tax on all financial trades.AD3. Who would be hit?Primarily the richest of the rich -- only a fraction of the top 1% of households, in the case of some of these proposals. The wealth tax proposed by Warren, for instance, would hit the wealthiest 75,000 households, while a 70% top rate as proposed by Ocasio-Cortez would hit the top 0.01% of earners, according to IRS data. Biden\u2019s increases to income taxes affect those earning above $400,000. His higher capital gains rates kick in after $1 million in income. Financial transactions taxes would fall most heavily on high-frequency traders, while annual taxes on derivatives, a proposal known as mark to market, would hit investors, including hedge funds, but some plans limit the tax hit for pension funds, insurance contracts and college endowments.AD4. How much would such taxes raise?ADBiden\u2019s campaign says his tax package would raise about $4 trillion over 10 years.5. What would wealth taxes do for inequality?That\u2019s hotly debated. Targeting what people have, rather than what they earn, is generally seen as a more potent way to redistribute wealth, because wealth inequality is greater than income inequality. Some new research also suggests that raising tax rates wouldn\u2019t reduce inequality much, because much of the wealth among the richest Americans stems from private business profit taxed at lower rates and from assets that have grown in value but go un-taxed until they are sold.6. What\u2019s the argument for raising taxes on the rich?ADDemocrats argue -- and polling suggests an increasing number of voters agree -- that the government should use the tax code to redistribute wealth downward. Since the Republican tax cuts passed in 2017 gave the highest income taxpayers a larger proportion of reductions, they say the first order of business is to reverse that trend. They also favor increasing overall tax revenues to pay for an ambitious agenda on health care, higher education and action to limit climate change.AD7. What do opponents say?Biden\u2019s plan would decrease gross domestic product over the long term, raising only $3.2 trillion after accounting for macroeconmic effects. More broadly, they say, high taxes on income and on accumulated wealth would discourage innovation and investment. They also argue wealth tax would be an administrative nightmare, requiring taxpayers or the IRS to calculate annually the value of assets, including real estate and investments in private businesses that are notoriously hard to assess. Other critics say that taxes on financial trades would make capital more expensive for companies, meaning they\u2019d raise less of it. Such a tax could also reduce liquidity in markets, opponents say.AD8. Is this a U.S.-only thing?Many European nations have experimented with a wealth tax of some form, with support ebbing and flowing throughout the decades. Thomas Piketty\u2019s 2014 book \u201cCapital in the Twenty-First Century\u201d re-invigorated the debate particularly in European countries with high debt loads, which have eyed wealth taxes as ways to replenish their treasuries. Spain effectively abolished its wealth tax in 2008 but brought it back in 2011. French President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s 2017 decision to exempt financial holdings from a longstanding wealth tax contributed to the anger that set off the so-called Yellow Vest protests a year later. Neither Germany nor the U.K. has a wealth tax, but there\u2019s been debate within both countries about creating one. In Asia, where inequality has been rising especially rapidly, some countries that aren\u2019t strapped for cash have considered increases in taxes on large property holdings as a way of putting a lid on inequality. China\u2019s push to cut taxes for its middle class has led to expectations that the government will squeeze more from its growing ranks of affluent households.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P.", "comment": "1 Comments", "topic": "Business"}, {"cover": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/3GEY2HD3AUI6TMPTWIZ74WAR54.jpghttps://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/3GEY2HD3AUI6TMPTWIZ74WAR54.jpg", "title": "\u2018Superspreading\u2019 events, triggered by people who may not even know they are infected, propel coronavirus pandemic", "date": "Jul 18, 2020", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/07/18/coronavirus-superspreading-events-drive-pandemic/", "keyword": "China and the world order", "website": "the Washington Post", "author": "Ariana Eunjung Cha", "content": "Please NoteThe Washington Post is providing this important information about the coronavirus for free.

It had started with just two infections at the college bar on June 18, not long after the state began reopening. But the numbers quickly jumped to 12, then 18, then 34.As of Friday, she was staring at a spreadsheet with 187 infected at Harper\u2019s Restaurant and Brew Pub.\u201cThe tables were six feet apart, but no one stayed there,\u201d she said. \u201cThe DJ was playing music so people were shouting, the dance floor started to get crowded. We had flattened the curve and then boom.\u201dThe East Lansing case is what\u2019s known as a superspreading event \u2014 possibly the largest so far in the United States among the general public. Many scientists say such infection bursts \u2014 probably sparked by a single, highly infectious individual who may show no signs of illness and may unwittingly share an enclosed space with many others \u2014 are driving the pandemic. They worry these cases, rather than routine transmission between one infected person and, say, two or three close contacts, are propelling case counts out of control.ADADMore than 1,000 suspected clusters \u2014 ranging from the single digits to thousands \u2014 have been logged in a database compiled by a coder in the Netherlands. A megachurch in South Korea. A political rally in Madrid. An engagement party in Rio de Janeiro. Nearly all took place indoors, or in indoor-outdoor spaces.Even as the Trump administration pressures schools to reopen this fall, the latest research suggests that understanding how and why these events occur \u2014 and how to prevent them \u2014 is key to reopening safely. In recent days, governors from at least 18 states, including Michigan, have backtracked on plans to loosen restrictions due to outbreaks.But even those efforts may fail if people ignore the most common ways the virus is considered to spread. Transmission, it turns out, is far more idiosyncratic than previously understood. Scientists say they believe it is dependent on such factors as an individual\u2019s infectivity, which can vary person to person by billions of virus particles, whether the particles are contained in large droplets that fall to the ground or in fine vapor that can float much further, and how much the air in a particular space circulates.ADADDonald Milton, a professor of environmental health at the University of Maryland, and other experts have wondered if superspreading events could be the \u201cAchilles\u2019 heel\u201d of the virus. If we could pinpoint the conditions under which these clusters occur, Milton argued, we could lower the transmission rate enough to extinguish the spread.\u201cIf you could stop these events, you could stop the pandemic,\u201d Milton said. \u201cYou would crush the curve.\u201dOne key factor in such events may be airborne transmission \u2014 an idea gaining new adherents but that has not been proved conclusively. The World Health Organization has described most infections as occurring from close face-to-face contact involving large, virus-laced respiratory droplets that drop to the ground within a few feet of the person expelling them due to gravity. But this month, a group of prominent scientists made the case that superspreading clusters suggest the virus is sometimes being transmitted over longer distances through the air in far smaller and more numerous particles.ADADThe coronavirus does not appear to be airborne in the same way as measles or tuberculosis, which have much higher rates of transmission. But the proponents of airborne transmission say it appears the virus could act similarly in some environments \u2014 a theory with major implications for the reopening of businesses and schools, as well as for nursing homes and residences dependent on ventilation systems that recirculate air.Jose-Luis Jimenez, a researcher at the University of Colorado Boulder, was one of 239 scientists who penned an open letter to the WHO, calling for greater recognition of the role that clouds of fine aerosols containing the virus may play in its spread, prompting the agency last week to acknowledge \u201cemerging evidence\u201d of airborne transmission.\u201cIt is becoming clear that the pandemic is driven by superspreading events, and that the best explanation for many of those events is aerosol transmission.\u201d Jimenez said.TransmissionAs we enter the seventh month of the global pandemic, scientists are still frustratingly in the dark when it comes to key aspects of how the virus is transmitted.ADADWhy, for instance, didn\u2019t the earliest infections in the United States, or the infamous Lake of the Ozarks party, spur lots of cases, while a much smaller gathering at a Michigan bar produced nearly 200? Why out of countless large gatherings held \u2014 church services, soccer games, choir rehearsals, and Zumba classes \u2014 did only a fraction ignite significant infections?Part of the uneven spread of the coronavirus \u2014 and the phenomenon of superspreading \u2014 can be explained by extreme individual variation in infectivity, researchers say.Some people will not transmit the virus to anyone, contact tracing has shown, while others appear to spread the virus with great efficiency. Overall, researchers have estimated in recent studies that some 10 to 20 percent of the infected may be responsible for 80 percent of all cases.ADADScientists are only starting to understand the different factors \u2014 physiological, behavioral, environmental \u2014 that play a role in amplifying transmission.An infected person\u2019s viral load can impact how much they \u201cshed\u201d; the differences have been shown to be on a scale of billions of virus particles. A recluse is less likely to spread the virus than a social butterfly. And being outdoors with masks, as we\u2019ve been told countless times, is less likely to lead to spread than being indoors.When many U.S. states imposed stay-at-home orders in mid-March, epidemiologists stressed the importance of the R0. Known as the basic reproduction number and pronounced \u201cr-naught\u201d (a Britishism for the number zero), it is a measure of how many people on average a single individual infects. In measles, that number is very high \u2014 somewhere between 12 to 18. In Ebola, it\u2019s about 1.5.ADADFor the novel coronavirus, it\u2019s thought to be somewhere in between, around two to three. But researchers say that number obscures what is really happening on the ground.A growing body of evidence suggests that SARS-CoV2, like other coronaviruses, expands in a community in fits and starts, rather than more evenly over space and time. Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine has estimated that the value of what\u2019s known as the k-parameter \u2014 a measure of how much a virus tends to cluster \u2014 indicates that just 10 percent of people may be responsible for 80 percent of novel coronavirus cases.Real world data corroborates the skewed transmission pattern.ADIn a detailed analysis of outbreaks in Hong Kong, for example, researchers found three distinct groups of incidents. The superspreading individuals, representing 20 percent of the total, were responsible for 80 percent of transmissions. A second group, involving about 10 percent of cases, transmitted the virus to one or two others. The final group, 70 percent, did not infect anyone else at all.ADIn Israel, investigators looking at 212 cases concluded that they could be linked back to 1 to 10 percent of people. And in an outbreak in a South Korea office tower, investigators found that about 45 percent of 216 workers got the virus from a single person. In the United States, an analysis from five counties in Georgia found that superspreading appeared to be \u201cwidespread across space and time,\u201d and that 2 percent of the infected seeded 20 percent of the cases.SettingsMost of these events took place in coronavirus hot spots of which most people are now aware: buildings where people live in close quarters, such as nursing homes, prisons, worker dormitories and cruise ships. There have been a fair number of clusters at meat-processing and frozen food factories, as well as at a curling event in Edmonton, Canada, leading some to speculate that temperatures could be a factor.ADAD\u201cIt is possible that the cold atmosphere in this setting has facilitated the spread of the virus,\u201d Gwenan Knight and others at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine wrote in an analysis of 201 events that was published in Wellcome Open Research.The rest of the known superspreading events were set in a hodgepodge of social venues where people gather in crowds: concerts, sports games, weddings, funerals, churches, political rallies, restaurants, shopping centers. And nearly all took place indoors, or in venues with indoor-outdoor spaces.Stanford researcher Morgan Kain, who focuses on mathematical modeling of disease transmission, said his analysis shows that regions that have not been greatly affected by the pandemic are most vulnerable because almost everyone would theoretically be susceptible to infection and a single unlucky confluence of an infectious person in the right environment could very quickly set off a chain reaction of transmissions. Kain and others argue that out-of-the-box ideas are needed to combat such spread.\u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s particularly dangerous in the United States that places that don\u2019t have cases are opening up, going back to indoor restaurants, bars, gyms where infected people move about,\u201d he said.One proposal, from a Moscow State University professor, calls for shifting testing resources from the general public to efforts to identify potential \u201csuper emitters\u201d with high viral loads by using randomized testing. Other proposals focus on limiting people\u2019s more random interactions, such as on public transit, or at bars and restaurants, while loosening restrictions on their regular contacts, such as through work or school. This would still pose some risk but would theoretically help contain it to certain social \u201cbubbles.\u201dScientists are also looking to technology to help prevent superspreading events. Several teams in far-flung parts of the world are trying to build breathalyzers or special paper that can detect active virus. Numerous governments and companies are experimenting with ultraviolet lights hooked up to ventilation systems to try to kill the virus as it passes through air conditioning and heating systems.Air and spaceYuguo Li, a professor at the University of Hong Kong who studies infection control and air, steers clear of the space between two tall buildings where there\u2019s no wind. He prefers to take his walks by the sea. And he avoids city buses.After spending several months scrutinizing some of the most famous superspreading cases involving the coronavirus, Li is convinced virus transmitted through the air played a role in many of them.In a case involving a restaurant in the Chinese city of Guangzhou where families from three adjacent tables were infected, for example, he describes how air currents near people flow in an upward plume, lifted by the warmth of the human body. He suspects the particles went into the air conditioning, which blew them toward those tables. None of the other diners or wait staff were affected.He believes ventilation may also be to blame for a case involving a young man from China\u2019s Hunan province, who sat in the back of a bus but ended up infecting seven others in various areas of the vehicle and then two more on a second minibus he hopped onto next. Li interviewed the patient, driver, passengers and reviewed video footage and found it odd that few of those who became infected were nearby. In fact, at least one passenger who fell ill was as far away as possible at the front of the bus \u2014 31 feet away \u2014 from the coronavirus-positive man.Similar inferences have been made about the outbreak at the Skagit Valley Chorale in Washington state, where 52 of the 61 singers who attended a 2\u00bd-hour practice became ill. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention wrote that the act of singing may have \u201ccontributed to transmission through emission of aerosols, which is affected by loudness of vocalization.\u201dIn addition, the researchers wrote, that \u201csuper-emitters, who release more aerosol particles during speech than do their peers, might have contributed to this and previously reported covid-19 superspreading events.\u201dWilliam Nazaroff, an environmental engineer from the University of California at Berkeley, explained that when people are indoors, they are literally breathing the same air as everyone else in the room. If the virus can be airborne, which he believes it can, then he said we need to consider whether every building that\u2019s open should modify its ventilation systems to be able to filter out more virus or use ultraviolet lights to kill it.\u201cIt has to do with the plume of what is emitted and the extent it can infringe on your breathing zone,\u201d Nazaroff said.Patient zerosWhile it\u2019s often impossible to identify the person who triggered an outbreak, there have been some commonalities among those who have been pinpointed as the likely source in studies. They tend to be young. Asymptomatic. Social.Scientists suspect these \u201csuper-emitters\u201d may have much higher levels of the virus in their bodies than others, or may release them by talking, shouting or singing in a different way from most people. Research based on the flu, which involved college students blowing into a tube, showed that a small percentage tended to emit smaller particles known as aerosols more than others. These particles tend to hang or float, and move with the flow of air \u2014 and therefore can go much farther and last longer than larger droplets.In a study published in Emerging Infectious Diseases by Japan\u2019s Hitoshi Oshitani at Tohoku University of 22 superspreading individuals with the coronavirus, about half were under the age of 40, and 41 percent were experiencing no symptoms.Julian Tang, a virologist at University Hospitals of Leicester in Britain, emphasized that whether someone triggers an outbreak often comes down to happenstance. Unlike some other viruses that may be contagious for a lifetime or months, the coronavirus has a very short window of infectivity \u2014 at most, four to nine days \u2014 according to multiple studies.Tang said studies of other diseases have shown the asymptomatic can sometimes shed more virus for longer periods, although whether this applies to the coronavirus is unknown.\u201cNormally if you get very sick, you clear the virus quickly,\" he explained. \"Ironically, if you are quite mildly ill, or not ill at all, your immune system might tolerate it more and you will shed longer with higher viral loads.\u201dHe said Typhoid Mary, the asymptomatic cook who was a superspreader of Salmonella typhi, was known to have a quirk in her immune system that did not allow her to clear the bacteria as well as others, so it was still present and more readily transmissible.In the case of the Hunan man who transmitted the virus while riding two buses, Li said that \u201camazingly\u201d after that four-hour window of infectivity, he is not known to have infected anyone else at all.\u201cLike autumn leaves suddenly all falling off,\u201d he said.184 cases, 16 countiesIn the case of Ingham County, where the superspreading event occurred at the college bar, the surrounding community of about 280,000 had mostly experienced slow transmission throughout the pandemic. But even after the owners of Harper\u2019s Restaurant and Brew Pub in East Lansing closed June 20 after the outbreak \u2014 and after Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D) shut indoor bar service throughout most of the state July 1 \u2014 the outbreak continued to spread.Of the 187 total cases traced back to Harper\u2019s Restaurant as of Friday, 144 were among people who had been at the venue. The other 43 were their family members, friends, co-workers and other contacts. The infected spanned hundreds of miles and 16 counties.Investigators were told there were 225 customers on two floors with a normal capacity of 950. The air conditioning was on, and some people were out on a deck. There was a line outside of people waiting to be let in.Harper\u2019s did not respond to request for comment but said in a Facebook post that it is working to modify its heating and air conditioning system with air purifying technology.Health officials have yet to find the first patient but are focusing on a few possibilities. Vail said it may be impossible to find the original source given that about a third of the initial cases were asymptomatic, as were 19 percent of people who caught it from those at the bar.\u201cIt\u2019s just crazy,\u201d she said of how quickly infections climbed.While the numbers have continued increasing for more than three weeks, Vail takes comfort in the fact that most people they have reached are providing lists of their contacts, and that new cases appear to be slowing down.\u201cI guess I might have thought that was going to go higher,\u201d she said, \u201cwhich tells me that at least people paid attention when we told them to quarantine.\u201dEmily Rauhala contributed to this report.Read more:Coronavirus autopsies: A story of 38 brains, 87 lungs and 42 heartsThe heartbreaking story of how Michael Hickson, who was black and disabled, died of coronavirusThe ultimate covid-19 mystery: Why does it spare some and kill others?", "comment": "1.2k Comments", "topic": "Health"}, {"cover": "", "title": "Why the Way We Live Now Will Mean More Pandemics", "date": "Jul 12, 2020", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/why-the-way-we-live-now-will-mean-more-pandemics/2020/07/09/d07f383c-c1a1-11ea-8908-68a2b9eae9e0_story.html", "keyword": "China and the world order", "website": "the Washington Post", "author": "", "content": "The coronavirus crisis clearly caught most governments unprepared, yet disease specialists have been warning for decades that such a devastating outbreak was bound to happen.

Subscribe today.arrow-right1. Are we likely to see more pandemics?Yes. The danger of a new disease spreading globally has been elevated in the modern age by the leap in air travel and international trade. The number of passenger trips by air more than doubled from the turn of the century to an estimated 4.2 billion in 2018 \u2014 before the pandemic walloped travel and tourism. Especially worrisome are pathogens that transmit effectively via the respiratory tract, such as coronaviruses like the one causing the current crisis and new strains of flu, the most common cause of pandemics.ADAD2. Where do new diseases come from?Novel pathogens that sicken humans have been discovered at an average rate of more than three per year over the past four decades. About 75% come from animals and are known as zoonoses. Bats are thought to be the source of the coronaviruses that cause Covid-19, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). They\u2019ve also been linked to the Ebola virus, as well as the Hendra and Nipah viruses responsible for deaths in Australia and Southeast Asia. The threat from bats is partly a reflection of their sheer numbers; they are among the most populous mammals. Bats roost together by the thousands, creating an environment rich for swapping viruses, and they can transmit them to other animals or humans through their blood, saliva, urine and feces.3. What drives the emergence of zoonoses?ADADResearchers have identified a number of factors increasing the potential for so-called spillover events, when a pathogen jumps species:\u2022 Encroachment into natural ecosystems. As the world\u2019s population has expanded, humans have taken over wilderness areas at a rapid pace. Researchers concluded in 2017 that in the prior two decades people had claimed another 10% of the Earth\u2019s wild land, reducing to 23% the area free of disturbance. New settlements and operations such as logging and mining put people in closer proximity to wild animals.\u2022 Consumption of wildlife. There\u2019s been a growing trade in wild animals, especially for food. In some live animal markets, domestic and wild animals are caged in close proximity and slaughtered under unhygienic conditions. Live markets in China were connected to the emergence of SARS. It was initially but is no longer thought that the novel coronavirus jumped into people at such a market.ADAD\u2022 Urbanization. About 55% of the world\u2019s people live in urban areas, compared with 34% in 1960. Expanding metropolitan areas provide new homes for a variety of wildlife, including rats, monkeys, birds and foxes \u2014 animals that can live off the plentiful food humans discard.\u2022 Intensive livestock farming. Pathogens from wild creatures sometimes make their way to humans via farm animals. As with people, packing many cows, pigs or chickens closely together increases the danger that a disease can spread. Antibiotics used to hasten the growth of animals can also promote pathogens that are resistant to treatment.\u2022 Climate change. Rising temperatures have contributed to the expansion of the range of disease-spreading mosquitoes, ticks and biting midges. These species can persist for longer periods, increasing the spread of illnesses such as Lyme disease, hepatitis E, dengue and West Nile virus.ADAD4. What\u2019s being done about live-animal markets?There have been calls, including from U.S. lawmakers, for China to close its so-called wet markets. But such places, offering fresh meat and produce more cheaply than supermarkets, play a huge role in feeding people, supplying about 60% of fresh food in the city of Guangzhou, for example. In February, China did permanently ban the trade in non-aquatic wild animals, although it made an exception for their use in traditional medicine. African countries have also been called upon to halt the trade in slaughtered wild animals, though it\u2019s unlikely to happen because \u201cbushmeat\u201d provides a much-needed source of protein.5. What else could be done to prevent pandemics?ADExperts point to a need to better monitor emerging diseases and maintain public-health systems that can quickly respond to them. In the most ambitious effort to catalog new pathogens, the U.S.-funded Predict project from 2009 to 2019 identified more than 1,000 viruses with spillover potential. Researchers aim next to assess the biggest disease risks lurking in the animal world in order to focus efforts toward developing tests and prototype vaccines. Those could provide early warning systems for outbreaks and rapid responses to stop them from spreading.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P.", "comment": "0 Comments", "topic": "Business"}, {"cover": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/QOGVRNWCJII6VN62LAB3FFHENU.jpghttps://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/QOGVRNWCJII6VN62LAB3FFHENU.jpg", "title": "Biden releases U.S.-centered economic plan, challenging Trump\u2019s \u2018America First\u2019 agenda", "date": "Jul 9, 2020", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/biden-releases-700-billion-plan-to-spur-american-economy/2020/07/09/f51b846c-c173-11ea-b178-bb7b05b94af1_story.html", "keyword": "China and the world order", "website": "the Washington Post", "author": "Sean SullivanJeff Stein", "content": "Joe Biden unveiled a proposal Thursday to spend $700 billion on American products and research, challenging President Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d agenda with a competing brand of economic nationalism and setting the stage for an election-year showdown over the country\u2019s financial future.Support our journalism.

It also amounted to a recognition that while Trump trails in the polls, many voters support his handling of the economy.The president has been arguing for months that the economy will regain its momentum when business, restaurants and other operations are allowed to reopen.

Biden has very smart people around him, particularly on the economic side.\u201dBiden\u2019s pitch underscores a striking shift in both parties away from globalization and free trade and toward protecting American workers and revitalizing struggling domestic industries. Those trends have been accelerated by the coronavirus pandemic, which has wreaked havoc on the economy.Biden said Thursday that his plan would restore the jobs lost this year and create 5 million new ones. It amounted to the most forceful case he has made for reducing dependence on foreign countries to supply the United States with essential goods.ADADBiden repeatedly castigated Trump and sounded populist notes that were reminiscent of his more liberal primary challengers. He stressed the need to protect workers and Main Street rather than the \u201cwealthy investor class\u201d and \u201cbankers and CEOs.\u201d He declared that \u201cenough is enough,\u201d saying it is \u201ctime to reverse the priorities in this country. It\u2019s time to help small businesses, middle-class folks, manage their way through the pandemic.\u201dTrump\u2019s rise in 2016 was built heavily on promises of bringing back American jobs, as well as blaming immigrants for hurting American workers. As president, he has stoked a trade war with China and imposed tariffs that flew in the face of his party\u2019s orthodoxy.Vice President Pence was also in Pennsylvania on Thursday, touting Trump\u2019s economic performance in a talk to business leaders in the borough of Malvern near Philadelphia. While 22 million jobs have been lost during the pandemic, the country has regained 7 million of them, Pence said.ADADWe see \u201cthis country coming back because of the solid foundation that was put in place\u201d by the Trump administration, Pence said, including lower taxes, less regulation, more U.S.-produced energy and better trade agreements. He called it \u201cthe great American comeback.\u201dStill, Trump\u2019s efforts to revive domestic manufacturing produced uneven results even before the pandemic. There were fewer manufacturing workers in Wisconsin this January than there were at any point under the Bush administration, for example.Biden, who once supported the North American Free Trade Agreement and Trans-Pacific Partnership, has in contrast focused his current campaign on prioritizing American industries, following the lead of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), the democratic socialist who was his top rival for the Democratic nomination, and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who released a  \u201cPlan For Economic Patriotism\u201d during the primary and has undergone vetting by Biden\u2019s campaign to be his running mate.ADADBiden and Warren\u2019s teams consulted closely on the new plan, according to two people with knowledge of the situation, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe private talks.The plan won some praise Thursday from liberal leaders. \u201cAll in all, on the right track,\u201d Columbia University economics professor Jeffrey Sachs wrote in an email to The Post. Sachs supported Sanders for president and now backs Biden.Biden\u2019s new platform focuses heavily on using the power of the federal government to promote a U.S. domestic manufacturing base. The $400 billion procurement initiative would be spread over four years to spur demand for American products and services, as would the $300 billion investment in research and breakthrough technologies. Half of the $300 billion would go to clean-energy initiatives and were previously announced.ADADBefore Biden spoke Thursday, he toured the metal works plant with Sen. Robert P. Casey Jr. (D-Pa.) and plant owner Robert McGregor.\u201cHow are you, man?\u201d Biden asked a worker. \u201cI keep distance,\u201d the worker said. Biden wore a mask throughout the tour.Later he delivered his remarks outside at a covered loading dock. It started raining, and Biden invited attendees to seek shelter under the covering as the water loudly pelted the steel roof. Some workers took him up on his offer.Circles were placed in front of Biden\u2019s lectern to encourage listeners to stay within them and maintain social distancing. Reporters had their temperatures taken and were asked coronavirus screening questions as they entered.ADBiden broadened his argument against Trump beyond the economy, criticizing his defense of Confederate symbols, which has been the subject of ongoing debate in the presidential race. Trump is \u201cdetermined to drive us apart to keep his base in place,\u201d the former vice president said.ADHolding a significant lead in the polls, Biden is seeking to close off any possible openings for Trump to make the contest more competitive. He said he plans to unveil proposals next week on infrastructure and clean energy, the second part of what he bills as the \u201cBuild Back Better\u201d plan. The other two components are caregiving and education, and racial equality.Both campaigns are gearing up for an escalating clash over the economy, a normally dominant theme in presidential elections. Trump argues that he built a booming economy before the coronavirus outbreak and could do it again. Biden blames Trump for his erratic reaction to the pandemic and frequent flouting of public health advice, which he says fueled the alarming rate of infections and badly damaged the economy as a result.ADOn the Republican side, White House advisers and allies worried about Biden\u2019s \u201cBuy American\u201d push, with Bannon saying on his radio program that the Democrat\u2019s rollout could help him in such states as Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, which Trump narrowly won in major 2016 upsets.ADTrump aides said the president remains the obvious person to reignite the economy as he has done before.\u201cPresident Trump\u2019s policies of lower taxes, deregulation, reciprocal trade and energy independence built a booming economy once, and they will do so again under his leadership,\u201d said Judd Deere, a White House spokesman.White House officials led by senior Trump adviser Peter Navarro have drafted an executive order requiring federal agencies to buy medical supplies and pharmaceuticals produced in the United States.That executive order has languished for months, however, amid objections by some of Trump\u2019s other senior advisers, including Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Trump\u2019s son-in-law Jared Kushner, who have warned that it could lead China to limit the supply of personal protective equipment, or PPE, that it is sending to the United States.Some analysts said  the executive order could now be signed swiftly, but it remained unclear Thursday when or whether that would happen.When it comes to Biden\u2019s plan, the Democrat\u2019s campaign says he will finance the ongoing costs of his economic agenda by reversing some of Trump\u2019s tax cuts for corporations and imposing \u201ccommon-sense tax reforms that finally make sure the wealthiest Americans pay their fair share.\u201d The campaign declined to provide a more detailed accounting of how it would pay for the $700 billion in spending it  proposed Thursday.A senior Biden campaign official said more specific details would be released once the full plan is out, speaking on the condition of anonymity because the campaign did not authorize the person to speak on the record. Those details would include a stimulus package, which Biden believes will be needed, and continuing costs, the official said.Biden often touts his central role in the Obama administration, but he has been less eager to tout the administration\u2019s championing of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), which proved controversial with the party\u2019s union base. Labor leaders said it did too little to require America\u2019s partners improve their environmental and labor standards.Trump highlighted the shortcomings of the TPP and other trade deals in his 2016 campaign and rejected it upon taking office. Biden has said he wants to renegotiate the agreement, which includes several Asian countries and which supporters say could serve as a bulwark against China\u2019s influence. Thursday\u2019s plan calls for using tax dollars to \u201cstand up to the Chinese government\u2019s abuses, insist on fair trade, and extend opportunity to all Americans.\u201d\u201cTrade negotiations over big trade deals is something that in sequence will follow a dramatic set of domestic investments,\u201d said the senior Biden campaign official. In addition to closing loopholes around existing \u201cBuy American\u201d clauses, Biden is pushing for a crackdown on false advertising of \u201cBuy American\u201d goods.Since the end of the Obama administration, many Democrats have backed off the TPP and focused instead on directly promoting domestic production. Bipartisan momentum has grown in recent weeks for tax incentives for companies to onshore their supply chains, in part because of the gaps in U.S. medical supply production exposed by the pandemic.The nation is facing a new shortage of personal protective equipment, including of N95 masks and medical gowns, as cases rise. But bringing supply chains back to the United States could prove difficult, and the Trump administration has struggled to do so.A Biden administration, like the Trump White House, would face the prospect of foreign retaliation for any promotion of American companies. \u201cBuy American\u201d provisions are also likely to face objections from U.S. firms that would see their costs increase if forced to buy more expensive supplies. Senior Biden officials said Wednesday that their plans were carefully vetted and do not run afoul of World Trade Organization rules.\u201cIncentivizing companies to raise their costs by \u2018Buying American\u2019 is not going to fix almost two decades of low productivity growth \u2014 it\u2019s going to take us in the opposite direction,\u201d said Adam Ozimek, chief economist at Upwork. \u201cThis will just create higher costs for American businesses and consumers.\u201d\n\n\n\n", "comment": "2.4k Comments", "topic": "Politics"}, {"cover": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/OLXBIEWCWUI6VCIINCRLT2XJ4A.jpghttps://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/OLXBIEWCWUI6VCIINCRLT2XJ4A.jpg", "title": "The Daily 202: Trump's move to weaken key environmental law could sideline communities of color", "date": "Jul 13, 2020", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/daily-202/2020/07/13/daily-202-trump-s-move-to-weaken-key-environmental-law-could-sideline-communities-of-color/5f0b8422602ff10807199f2c/", "keyword": "China and the world order", "website": "the Washington Post", "author": "Juliet Eilperin", "content": "with Mariana AlfaroNote to readers: James Hohmann is on vacation until July 20.

Subscribe today.arrow-rightAt a moment when many communities of color are calling for greater input in public policy, President Trump is seeking to overhaul one of the nation's most powerful environmental laws in a way that could minimize their voices.On Wednesday, the president is slated to finalize changes to the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), which requires the federal government to analyze how a major decision affects the environment and take public comment. Trump will travel to Atlanta to make the case that scaling back the 50 year-old statute will speed the construction of highways, pipelines and other infrastructure projects across the country. His cheerleading for a robust economic rebound comes in the midst of the novel coronavirus pandemic that continues to set new infection records.NEPA has emerged as a major legal counterweight to the Trump administration\u2019s policy agenda.\u00a0And it's one of the most effective ways Americans of color have pushed back against plans that could harm their health and environment. Business groups and some unions, however, argue that it is a burdensome and complex law that has exponentially increased the cost and time it takes to modernize America\u2019s infrastructure.ADADAsked about the new rule, White House spokesman Judd Deere said in an email, \u201cThe President will continue to take action to facilitate the great American comeback and to improve the quality of life [for] all Americans.\u201dIn the past few months alone, challenges involving the law have halted at least three multibillion-dollar projects championed by the administration and its allies in the energy industry: the Keystone XL pipeline, the Dakota Access pipeline and the Atlantic Coast pipeline. In late June, a federal judge ordered the U.S. Forest Service to redo its environmental impact assessment for a plan to log old-growth trees across 1.8 million acres of Alaska\u2019s Tongass National Forest, after finding the initial proposal violated the law\u2019s basic requirements.Back in January, the White House proposed major changes to NEPA to limit which projects it applied to, how the government would calculate a proposal\u2019s environmental impacts and how long the public would have to weigh in on any given decision.ADADThese changes include eliminating the requirement to examine a project\u2019s cumulative impact, including taking into account other projects in the area; requiring the most complex analyses be completed within two years; and prohibiting agencies from calculating the climate impact of burning fossil fuels extracted from federal lands or waters once they reach their final destination.\u201cIt\u2019s just massive,\u201d said Raul Garcia, legislative director for healthy communities in the policy and legislative department of Earthjustice, an environmental law group, referring to the administration's NEPA overhaul.\u00a0He argued the administration is rewriting the law \u201cwith the overall goal of excluding the public, undermining the study of the impacts that our federal infrastructure has on our communities and cutting a blank check for companies to do whatever they want when it comes to affecting public health and safety.\u201dA coalition of groups \u2014 energy, farming, logging, ranching and chemical manufacturers \u2014 seeks to scale back NEPA.\u00a0Marty Durbin, president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce\u2019s Global Energy Institute, said in a phone interview Saturday the administration\u2019s overhaul will \u201cprovide predictability and transparency\u201d so developers can learn whether a project is viable. The lengthy analysis required under the law, coupled with the legal challenges that almost inevitably follow, can delay proposals for several years.ADAD\u201cThe question is, can we have a process in place here that, in a reasonable time frame, can get us to a yes or a no,\u201d he said. \u201cWe totally support environmental reviews of whatever\u2019s necessary, and community input.\u201dFor decades, developers have deliberately built polluting operations \u2014 including trash incinerators, coal stacks and chemical plants \u2014 near low-income communities and communities of color. A study published last year in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences found African Americans bear a \u201cpollution burden\u201d that is 56 percent higher than other Americans, on average, relative to what they spend on goods and services. Hispanics have a pollution burden that is 63 percent higher, the researchers found.Durbin argued that going forward, industries can rectify these wrongs by building mass transit and renewable energy projects under a streamlined law.ADAD\u201cWe should look at this as an opportunity to provide more economic growth to those areas and have more environmentally sustainable projects in those communities,\u201d he said. \u201cWe clearly have to recognize things we didn\u2019t do right in past, so how do we build them going forward?\u201dBut the Coalition for Healthy Ports\u2019 Kim Gaddy, a 56-year-old activist living in the South Ward of Newark, said in a phone interview that the long-standing environmental law is a critical tool in fending off development contributing to the city\u2019s higher rates of cancer and lung disease.Gaddy has three children with asthma, ages 31, 20 and 16. The area is already home to long-haul diesel trucks shipping goods from the New York-New Jersey Port, Newark Liberty International Airport, the largest incinerator in the Northeast, a natural-gas power plant and another gas plant being proposed by NJ Transit.\u00a0ADADResidents in Newark\u2019s East Ward, known as the Ironbound, convinced policymakers to reroute some heavy trucks off local streets by using NEPA. Gaddy said she fears the NEPA changes will weaken residents\u2019 ability to push back on additional development.\u201cOur main issue is we already suffer from the cumulative impacts of pollution that has disproportionately impacted people of color. So one of the reasons we are fighting for NEPA is that NEPA at least allows us to have a voice,\u201d she said, adding the White House shouldn\u2019t be changing the law \u201cin this day and age of police brutality, of covid-19, when more of us are impacted because we have compromised health systems.\u201d\u00a0\u201cSo now you\u2019re silencing us totally,\u201d Gaddy said. \u201cYou\u2019re forcing us to accept more pollution.\u201dWhile you were sleepingThe Washington Redskins will change their name.\u00a0\u201cThe Washington Redskins plan to announce Monday morning that they will change their team name, three people with knowledge of the situation confirmed Sunday night. The team is not expected to reveal a new name until a later date,\u201d Les Carpenter and Mark Maske report. \u201cTwo people with knowledge of the team\u2019s plans said Sunday that the preferred replacement name is tied up in a trademark fight, which is why the team can\u2019t announce the new name Monday. \u2026 The decision to change the nearly 87-year-old team name comes amid mounting pressure on the franchise from corporate sponsors and the broader nationwide discussion of race.\u201d\u00a0China imposes sanctions on GOP Sens. Marco Rubio (Fla.) and Ted Cruz (Texas).They are for \u201cinterfering in China's internal affairs,\u201d The Post reports. \u201cNo details were disclosed on what the sanctions would involve, but the move comes days after the Trump administration banned three Chinese officials from visiting the United States and froze any U.S. assets they might have.\u201d The sanctions also extend to former Kansas governor Sam Brownback (R), Trump's ambassador for international religious freedom, and Rep. Christopher H. Smith (R-N.J.).The coronavirusLong delays in getting test results are hobbling the coronavirus response.\u00a0\u201cTest results for the novel coronavirus are taking so long to come back that experts say the results across the United States are often proving useless in the campaign to control the deadly disease,\u201d Rachel Weiner, William Wan and Abigail Hauslohner report. \u201cSome testing sites are struggling to provide results in five to seven days. Others are taking even longer. Outbreaks across the Sun Belt have strained labs beyond capacity. That rising demand, in turn, has caused shortages of swabs, chemical reagents and equipment as far away as New York. The long testing turnaround times are making it impossible for the United States to replicate the central strategy used by other countries to effectively contain the virus \u2014 test, trace and isolate. \u2026\u00a0ADAD\u201cAfter attending a funeral, Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms (D) and her family got tested June 29 as a precaution. No one in her family had developed symptoms. A week later, her test results still hadn\u2019t come back, but her husband started feeling ill. So they got a different, rapid test through Emory University. Within hours, Bottoms learned that she, her husband and one of the couple\u2019s four children had all become infected. It wasn\u2019t until the next day that their initial test results finally arrived. They showed that when the family first got tested, only one of them, the child, had the virus. While they waited for their test results, the boy possibly passed it to his parents. \u2026\u201cMore efficient testing \u2014 such as in South Korea, where results are often given the next day \u2014 might have prevented the Bottomses from getting the virus. But such turnarounds seem out of reach in the United States because of a lack of federal coordination, supply shortages and surging demand as outbreaks in some states spiral out of control.\"The U.S. has recorded 3.29 million cases and more than 132,000 deaths. Two Trump health officials warned that more will die.\u201cAdm. Brett Giroir, an assistant secretary with the Health and Human Services department, and Dr. Jerome Adams, the surgeon general, both emphasized their concern about surging outbreaks, many of them in areas where people have not followed recommended public health guidelines to contain the spread of the virus,\u201d the Times reports. \u201c\u2018We\u2019re all very concerned about the rise in cases, no doubt about that,\u2019 [Giroir] said.\u2019 \u2018We do expect deaths to go up,\u2019 \u2026\u2018If you have more cases, more hospitalizations, we do expect to see that over the next two or three weeks before this turns around.\u2019 Still, [Giroir] and Dr. Adams offered up a few optimistic notes. Admiral Giroir said the percentage of positive test results was leveling off, and both officials said that doctors had better tools to treat people who become sick than they did at the start of the pandemic. \u2026\u00a0ADAD\u201cBoth health officials were questioned about the administration\u2019s reluctance to consider returning to a lockdown in some cities and states. Asked on \u2018This Week\u2019 if states with stark increases in cases, like Florida, South Carolina, Arizona, Texas and Georgia, should consider more stringent measures, [Giroir] said \u2018everything should be on the table.\u2019 He said closing bars and limiting the number of patrons allowed in restaurants were \u2018two measures that really do need to be done.\u2019 \u2026 Dr. Adams struck a similar tone \u2026 Appearing on \u2018Face the Nation,\u2019 Dr. Scott Gottlieb, a former commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration in the Trump administration, said, \u2018I think things are going to get worse before they get better.\u2019\u201dFlorida reported more than 15,000 positive cases \u2013 the highest single-day number for any state.\u00a0\u201cFlorida health officials on Sunday reported 15,300 new confirmed cases of COVID-19 \u2014 more than any other state in America has previously reported in a single day. The number in the Florida Department of Health\u2019s latest update blew past the previous high, 12,274 by New York on April 4, and past Florida\u2019s previous high of 11,458 on July 4,\u201d the Miami Herald reports. \u201cWhile the figure reflects Florida\u2019s ballooning case numbers in recent weeks, it may also be the result of a dramatic one-day rise in the number of reported test results. \u2026 But a Herald analysis this past week found disturbing two-week trends \u2014 of increasing positivity and rising numbers of confirmed cases, even as testing volume remained the same. Florida has now had 269,811 confirmed case \u2026 [Republican Gov. Ron] DeSantis has recommended the wearing of face masks, but he has resisted calls to mandate it \u2026 Miami-Dade County Mayor Carlos Gimenez told CNN on Sunday that the county\u2019s hospitals will soon reach capacity, but he said more beds can be added, including for intensive care. \u2026\u00a0ADAD\u201cHealth experts are concerned that people are gathering in crowds, and have expressed concern that the Republican National Convention\u2019s nomination party for Trump is scheduled to be held in Jacksonville in August. A commissioner for a county near Jacksonville is seriously ill with the virus, according to a posting by his daughter on Facebook. \u2026 On Saturday, the Magic Kingdom and Animal Kingdom reopened at Walt Disney World in Orlando, concerning health experts who urge people not to gather in groups. Guests at the park said that people were wearing masks and social distancing, and videos showed near-empty parks.\u201dThe White House is trying to discredit Tony Fauci.\u201cFauci no longer briefs Trump and is \u2018never in the Oval [Office] anymore,\u2019 said a senior administration official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. Fauci last spoke to the president during the first week of June, according to a person with knowledge of Trump\u2019s calendar,\" write Yasmeen Abutaleb, Josh Dawsey and Laurie McGinley.\u00a0\"A White House official released a statement saying that \u201cseveral White House officials are concerned about the number of times Dr. Fauci has been wrong on things\u201d and included a lengthy list of the scientist\u2019s comments from early in the outbreak. Those included his early doubt that people with no symptoms could play a significant role in spreading the virus \u2014 a notion based on earlier outbreaks that the novel coronavirus would turn on its head. They also point to public reassurances Fauci made in late February, around the time of the first U.S. case of community transmission, that \u201cat this moment, there is no need to change anything that you\u2019re doing on a day-by-day basis.\u201dBetsy DeVos made it clear she wants schools to fully reopen for most students.\u00a0\u201cDeVos made her latest statement about what schools should do on CNN\u2019s \u2018State of the Union.\u2019 In the interview with journalist Dana Bash, DeVos doubled down on calls she made last week for schools to reopen. \u2018Kids need to be in school,\u2019 she said. \u2018They need to be learning, they need to be moving ahead. And we can\u2019t \u2014 we cannot be paralyzed and not allow that or not be intent on that happening,\u2019\u201d Valerie Strauss reports. \u201cDeVos said nothing, however, about what school superintendents have been saying they need to reopen: billions of dollars in additional federal funding to cover the costs of changes they have to make and personal protective equipment they need to buy.\u201dFairfax County, Va., schools superintendent Scott Brabrand \u2013 one of the largest U.S. public school systems \u2013 said DeVos \u201ccan\u2019t put every kid back in a school.\u201d\u00a0DeVos has called out Fairfax County\u2019s plan to have students attend in-person schooling twice weekly while spending the other days in remote learning. Brabrand hit back, saying that \u201cthe guidelines for 6 feet social distancing simply mean that you can't put every kid back in a school with the existing square footage footprint. It's just that simple.\u201d (CNN)\u201cI wouldn\u2019t trust you to care for a house plant let alone my child,\" said Rep. Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.) in response to DeVos's push to fully reopen schools. Pressley was among several Democratic lawmakers, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (Calif.), Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (N.Y.) and Sen. Kamala D. Harris (Calif.), who publicly blasted DeVos following her Sunday claims. Pelosi accused Trump and his administration of \u201cmessing with the health of our children,\u201d noting, \u201cGoing back to school presents the biggest risk for the spread of the coronavirus.\u201d (Allyson Chiu)\u00a0A ray of hope: New York City reported zero coronavirus deaths for the first time since March.\u00a0\u201cAccording to initial data reported by the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, no one died from the virus in New York City on July 11. Officials recorded no confirmed deaths the day before as well, but did have two probable death. The department's data shows there hasn't been a day without a coronavirus-related death since March 13, two days after the first reported death,\u201d NBC New York reports. \u00a0California\u2019s failure on early mass testing led to the current surge.\u00a0\u201cCalifornia found itself unprepared, overwhelmed and constantly lagging,\u201d the Los Angeles Times found. \u201cThose early failures left California far behind in the fight against the coronavirus, and it has struggled to keep up \u2014 even as cases surge today. In the beginning, dozens of investigators, called \u2018cluster busters,\u2019 worked each case to try to contain the spread of the coronavirus. They aimed at identifying each strand of transmission and snipping it before the virus could take hold as a sturdy web across communities. They functioned as all-inclusive personal assistants: arranging child care, setting up WiFi, coordinating grocery drop-offs. But data would later show that, long before the official case count began to climb, the virus was freewheeling. Federal officials grappling with a shortage of test kits issued narrow testing criteria; that meant key local spreaders in the state\u2019s budding outbreak were going unnoticed and untraced.\u201d\u00a0Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner and Harris County Judge Lina Hidalgo, both Democrats, are calling for Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) to impose a statewide stay-at-home order amid surging case numbers. Regional cases rose to 63,864 on Sunday. At least 258,658 cases have been reported in the state, per our tracker. Abbott said he might consider shutting down more nonessential businesses if things worsen. (Houston Chronicle)Three Arizona teachers who shared a summer classroom contracted the virus, leaving one of them dead. Kimberley Chavez Lopez Byrd, 61, died last month, less than two weeks after she was hospitalized. All three teachers wore masks and gloves, according to school officials. The state topped 122,000 cases this weekend. (CNN)Several people who attended a huge sandbar party in Michigan for the Fourth of July have tested positive for the virus, officials said. The event was so crowded that health authorities said it\u2019s impossible to track all the people the infected attendees came into contact with. Footage from the event shows thousands partying hip-to-hip in the water. (M Live)Disagreements between the Fed and Treasury slowed down the start of the Main Street Lending Program.\u00a0\u201cThe differences centered on how to craft the loan terms of [the $600 billion program] to help support businesses through the early stages of the pandemic,\u201d the WSJ reports. \u201cFed officials generally favored easier terms that would increase the risk of the government losing money, while Treasury officials preferred a more conservative approach, people familiar with the process said. Treasury, which has put up $75 billion to cover losses, resisted recent changes to relax loan terms. \u2026 The upshot is that the program, announced in March, went through multiple revisions and opened for business this past week. As of Wednesday, it hadn\u2019t purchased any loans. Some Fed officials privately have voiced frustration that painstaking negotiations wasted precious weeks in launching the program.\u201dThe Trump presidencySen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said Bob Mueller may be called to testify after publishing an op-ed on Roger Stone.Graham, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, \u201cdidn\u2019t give any details on the timing of any potential invitation,\u201d Felicia Sonmez reports. \u201cGraham\u2019s statement came one day after Mueller defended his office\u2019s prosecution of Stone, Trump\u2019s longtime friend and political adviser, in a Post op-ed. Trump commuted Stone\u2019s 40-month prison sentence on Friday \u2026 In his statement Sunday, Graham suggested that he had reconsidered his position on allowing Mueller to testify in light of the former special counsel\u2019s op-ed. \u2018Apparently Mr. Mueller is willing \u2014 and also capable \u2014 of defending the Mueller investigation through an oped in the Washington Post,\u2019 Graham said. \u2018Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee have previously requested Mr. Mueller appear before the Senate Judiciary Committee to testify about his investigation. That request will be granted.\u2019 \u2026 A Graham spokeswoman, said a formal invitation to Mueller is in the works but did not provide details on the timing of any potential testimony. There are only about three dozen legislative days remaining for the Senate before the November election. \u2026\u201cTrump\u2019s commutation of Stone\u2019s sentence has triggered a flood of criticism, with Democrats \u2014 and a handful of Republicans \u2014 in recent days arguing that the move amounted to an abuse of presidential power and an effort to undermine the justice system. On Sunday, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) said that \u2018anyone who cares about the rule of law in this country\u2019 should be \u2018nauseated\u2019 by Trump\u2019s actions in the Stone case. \u2026 Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan (R) also criticized Trump\u2019s commutation of Stone\u2019s sentence, calling it a \u2018problem.\u2019 \u2018The president does have the right, by law, to take the action he took,\u2019 Hogan said on NBC News\u2019s \u2018Meet the Press.\u2019 \u2018That doesn\u2019t mean he should have.\u2019 \u2026 Trump fired back at two of the Republicans who have criticized him \u2014 Sens. Mitt Romney (Utah) and Patrick J. Toomey (Pa.) \u2014 in a tweet on Saturday night in which he called them \u2018RINO\u2019S.\u2019\u201dStone plans on campaigning for Trump now that he \u201cwon\u2019t die in a squalid hellhole of corona-19 virus.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m asthmatic,\u201d he told Axios. \u201cSending me to a prison where I could not be socially distanced ... would, I think, be a death sentence.\u201d He said he\u2019ll do \u201canything necessary to elect my candidate, short of breaking the law.\u201dTrump has made more than 20,000 false or misleading claims.\u201cIt took Trump 827 days to top 10,000 false and misleading claims in The Fact Checker\u2019s database, an average of 12 claims a day. But on July 9, just 440 days later, the president crossed the 20,000 mark \u2014 an average of 23 claims a day over a 14-month period,\u201d Glenn Kessler, Salvador Rizzo and Meg Kelly report. \u201cThe coronavirus pandemic has spawned a whole new genre of Trump\u2019s falsehoods. The category in just a few months has reached nearly 1,000 claims, more than his tax claims combined.\u201dMark Meadows has been feeding nuggets of information to suspected leakers to see if they pass them on.\u00a0So far, Meadows, Trump\u2019s chief of staff, has yet to discover any leakers, Axios reports. \u201cA source familiar with Meadows' thinking said he is \u2018focused on national security leaks and could care less about the palace intrigue stories.\u2019 On a recent podcast with Ted Cruz, however, Meadows said they tracked down and fired a federal employee who leaked information about a White House social media executive order.\u201d\u00a0Trump lashed out against supporters who built a portion of the border wall in his honor.\u201cTrump on Sunday criticized a privately built border wall in South Texas that\u2019s showing signs of erosion months after going up, saying it was \u2018only done to make me look bad,\u2019 even though the wall was built after a months-long campaign by his supporters,\u201d the AP reports. \u201cThe group that raised money online for the wall promoted itself as supporting Trump during a government shutdown that started in December 2018 because Congress wouldn\u2019t fund Trump\u2019s demands for a border wall. Called \u2018We Build the Wall,\u2019 the group has raised more than $25 million promoting itself as supporting the president. Former Trump chief strategist Steve Bannon joined the group\u2019s board and Trump ally Kris Kobach became its general counsel. \u2026 The section in question is a roughly 3-mile (5-kilometer) fence of steel posts just 35 feet (10 meters) from the Rio Grande, the river that forms the U.S.-Mexico border in Texas. That\u2019s much closer to the river than the government ordinarily builds border barriers in South Texas because of concerns about erosion and flooding that could violate U.S. treaty obligations with Mexico.\u201d\u00a0The electionTrump campaign manager Brad Parscale is hitting a rough patch.\u201cAs Trump\u2019s reelection effort struggles, Parscale, despite his self-promotion, increasingly finds himself out of favor with his boss and hemmed in by newly hired staffers and recently promoted advisers, according to people familiar with the campaign,\u201d Michael Scherer and Josh Dawsey report. \u201cTrump has made clear his displeasure with Parscale, especially after a disappointing rally in Tulsa, and the campaign has expanded its senior team in ways that diminish his role, according to multiple campaign and administration officials. Trump\u2019s new kitchen cabinet, a combination of White House and campaign employees led by White House senior adviser Jared Kushner, includes Parscale\u2019s recently promoted deputy Bill Stepien and two communications aides from the 2016 campaign \u2014 Hope Hicks and Jason Miller, who was recently hired by the campaign and is increasingly seen as its principal strategist. \u2026 [C]ampaign and White House officials say Parscale does not always appear to understand the political dynamics of crucial swing states. \u2026 A senior Trump administration official \u2026 said Parscale \u2018knows he screwed up\u2019 with the Trump rally\u2026\u00a0\u201c[Parscale is also absent] from campaign headquarters. Parscale lives in Florida, and the campaign is based in Northern Virginia, and staffers say that when they talk to him, he is often by his pool in Fort Lauderdale. \u2026 The amount of money that Parscale has personally earned from the campaign is undisclosed in Federal Election Commission reports, because the reports do not distinguish between the money that goes directly to him and the payments that go to his firm, Parscale Strategies, for pass-through costs. \u2026 Between September 2019 and May 2020, [Trump and GOP] accounts paid Parscale Strategies an average of $100,905 a month. \u2026 In comparison, records show that Biden\u2019s campaign manager, Jen O\u2019Malley Dillon, has been paid $11,486 a month since taking over in April.\u201d\u00a0The pandemic has reshaped the presidential race in the Sun Belt.\u00a0\u201cBiden is now leading Trump by six points in Florida, and the two are tied in Arizona and competitive in Texas, where Biden is down by just a point to Mr. Trump. Biden has made gains in part because most say their state's efforts to contain the virus are going badly \u2014 and the more concerned voters are about risks from the outbreak, the more likely they are to support Biden,\u201d a CBS News poll found. \u201cIn all three states, most voters say their state reopened too soon, and those who say this feel their state went too fast under pressure from the Trump administration. Most also say the president is doing a bad job handling the outbreak. He may be paying a price for that, at least in the short term.\u201d\u00a0Biden has a five-point lead over Trump in Texas, per a Dallas Morning News-University of Texas at Tyler poll.\u00a0The Biden campaign, though, has done little to demonstrate it will make a major push in the Lone Star State. Texas hasn\u2019t voted for a Democratic presidential candidate since Jimmy Carter in 1976.Trump\u2019s battle against Michigan\u2019s female leaders could have 2020 implications.\u00a0\u201cBeyond being the women leading Michigan\u2019s state government, Gretchen Whitmer, Dana Nessel and Jocelyn Benson have a lot in common,\u201d the Times reports. \u201cBy 2018, the three were swept into statewide office on a wave that flipped much of Michigan\u2019s leadership from red to blue and put three women \u2014 Ms. Whitmer, the governor; Ms. Nessel, the attorney general; and Ms. Benson, the secretary of state \u2014 in charge of running the state for the first time. Now these women share another distinction: They\u2019re all targets of Trump. Trailing in polls to Biden in this key battleground state, the president has taken aggressive aim at [them] zeroing in on their mission to expand voting rights in a state where his 2016 winning margin of just 10,704 votes was the narrowest in the country. The three women have in turn responded forcefully to Mr. Trump \u2026 Michigan Democrats believe that the state leaders are a not-so-secret weapon in the 2020 election. They see the president\u2019s frequent barbs \u2026 as helping fuel the anti-Trump bandwagon in the state, which before 2016 had not voted for a Republican presidential candidate since 1988.\u201dQuote of the day\u201cThere\u2019s a tsunami coming,\u201d in November, said former Virginia governor Terry McAuliffe (D) about the Democrats' chances in the general election. \u201cIf [Trump had] early on jumped in front of the coronavirus and been a leader, this guy would\u2019ve been unbeatable. But every opportunity he\u2019s had to stand up and be a leader, whether Charlottesville or anything else, he\u2019s failed each time.\u201d (Philip Rucker, Rachael Bade and Seung Min Kim)\u00a0Social media speed readThe Houston Chronicle's Sunday edition had a stand-alone obituary section:\u00a0Many jumped to Tony Fauci's defense after it was reported that the White House is leading a campaign against him:\u00a0Back in 1998, President George H.W.

Subscribe today.arrow-rightWhite House officials called it a potential landmark in the efforts to return pharmaceutical manufacturing to the United States from overseas. Over the past two decades, most U.S. generic drug production has shifted offshore, notably to sites in China and India. That dependence on foreign suppliers became controversial as the coronavirus pandemic raged, when both countries limited their exports and supplies in the United States ran short.\u201cThis is a great day for America. This has all of the elements of the Trump strategy. It\u2019s made in the USA. It\u2019s innovation that will allow American workers to compete with the pollution havens, sweatshops and tax havens of the world,\" said Peter Navarro, a White House adviser who has led the effort to return manufacturing to the United States.ADADBut some experts questioned whether the White House ambitions for a broader supply chain repatriation were achievable. The environmental and financial considerations that originally drove production of active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) offshore remain compelling, they said.\u201cThe investment that would be needed to restart some of the API business here in the U.S., especially with much more stringent [environmental] and wastewater requirements, it\u2019s really unrealistic to think that could be done and still be price competitive,\u201d said Susan Capie, managing director of PharmaVantage, a consultancy in Babylon, N.Y.Phlow Corp. of Richmond will lead a private sector team that will use a continuous chemical process rather than the step-by-step approach of traditional pharmaceutical manufacturing. AMPAC Fine Chemicals, Civica Rx, and the Medicines-for-All Institute at Virginia Commonwealth University round out the partnership.ADADThe Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), a government agency recently embroiled in controversy over the demotion of its former chief, awarded Phlow the contract.During the initial four years, the company will develop a \u201crapid surge\u201d capability for critically-needed medicines and their ingredients and build advanced manufacturing facilities to produce drugs that are in short supply, Eric Edwards, Phlow\u2019s chief executive, said in an interview.The company promises higher yields, less waste and more affordable medicines as a result of its continuous chemical process. Initial planning began about a year ago, Edwards said. Once the coronavirus materialized, he said he warned administration officials in early February of inevitable drug shortfalls.ADPhlow later submitted a bid under a BARDA contract competition, he said.AD\u201cI think it\u2019s a good thing, a really interesting step forward to put an investment into our pharmacy supply chain,\u201d said Erin Fox, pharmacist and drug-shortages expert at the University of Utah hospital.Maintaining adequate drug supplies \u2014 such as sedatives and painkillers for ventilator patients \u2014 has been a problem amid soaring demand during the pandemic, she said. Such shortages could worsen, as states reopen and hospitals resume performing elective surgeries.\u201cYou need some of those very same drugs for surgery that you need for critically ill and intubated patients with covid-19,\u201d she said.ADTo date, Phlow already has delivered to the government 1.6 million doses of antibiotics, sedatives, painkillers and blood pressure drugs, Edwards said.Watchdog office says \u2018reasonable grounds\u2019 to believe ouster of vaccine official was retaliatory, his lawyers sayThe U.S. imports annually more than $150 billion worth of biologics, human and animal drugs, and medical devices, the Food and Drug Administration said last year.ADSome experts were skeptical that Phlow\u2019s relatively modest contract will mean much change. \u201cThis production has moved abroad for business reasons,\u201d said Thomas Bollyky, director of the Council on Foreign Relations\u2019 Global Health Program. \u201cSo it\u2019s going to have to operate [in the U.S.] with a subsidy. The question is: how long are we willing to maintain that subsidy?\u201dADThe contract can be extended to a 10-year total of $812 million, according to the Health and Human Services Department, which oversees BARDA. The agency\u2019s former director, Rick Bright, recently filed a whistleblower complaint alleging he was dismissed from his job after resisting pressure from administration officials to stockpile the anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine, an unproven covid-19 treatment.Phlow is organized as a public benefit corporation, a for-profit venture that prioritizes positive social impact as one of its goals.ADEdwards is a veteran pharmaceutical executive who spent 18 years at Kal\u00e9o, a company that produced auto-injectible pens, including for emergency anti-allergy treatment.ADHis tenure at that company, which he co-founded with his twin brother, was the subject of a Senate investigation. Between 2014 and 2017, at the height of the opioid crisis, Kal\u00e9o raised the price of a naloxone auto-injector, which reverses the effects of drug overdoses, from $575 to $4,100, according to a report by the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs\u2019 permanent subcommittee on investigations. The increases cost taxpayers $142 million, the subcommittee concluded.In response, a Phlow spokesman said that Edwards \u201chad nothing to do with drug pricing decisions\u201d while at Kal\u00e9o. Edwards, who remains a Kal\u00e9o shareholder, left the company more than one year ago on \u201cgood terms,\u201d the spokesman said.ADPhlow\u2019s co-founder, Frank Gupton, also heads VCU\u2019s Medicines for All Institute, which receives funding from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Rosemary Gibson, a senior advisor at the Hastings Center, and a prominent critic of U.S. dependence upon Chinese pharmaceuticals, is a member of the company\u2019s board.ADThe United States still manufactures many cutting-edge biotech drugs, which tend to be more profitable, branded medications. Such drugs, typically delivered by injection or infusion, are produced by genetically modified cells in a complicated process dominated by Western manufacturers.The chemical synthesis used to make traditional pills, including most generics, is a more routine form of manufacturing that shifted to China and India decades ago.Capie said China imported most of its drugs before boosting domestic production in the 1980s. \u201cWhen China started ramping up their own industry, the goal was to be self-sufficient in what they needed rather than having to import,\u201d she said.ADADAt the same time, increasing price competition among generic drugs in the West prompted U.S. and European manufacturers to outsource production of those medicines to low-cost factories in Asia, she said.Production of the starter chemicals used to make drugs \u2014 the most environmentally toxic step of the process \u2014 has shifted to India as China, the former leader, has raised its environmental standards, Capie said. China now imports these starter chemicals to make intermediate powders known as active pharmaceutical ingredients, or API. Then Chinese or Indian companies turn that API into finished pills.Quality concerns have dogged Indian and Chinese generic manufacturers in recent years, with FDA inspectors repeatedly flagging them for regulatory infractions.The contract with Phlow could be \u201ca game changer that could significantly strengthen the U.S. drug supply chain and relieve many of the factors that contribute to drug shortages,\u201d said Tom Kraus, vice president of government relations for the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists.", "comment": "782 Comments", "topic": "Economy"}, {"cover": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/TOZTUHCNYYI6VFT34B2NGAWH2Q.jpghttps://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/TOZTUHCNYYI6VFT34B2NGAWH2Q.jpg", "title": "Readers critique The Post: Abraham Lincoln shouldn\u2019t have been described like this", "date": "Jul 17, 2020", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/letters-to-the-editor/readers-critique-the-post-abraham-lincoln-shouldnt-have-been-described-like-this/2020/07/17/45c3b49e-c82b-11ea-b037-f9711f89ee46_story.html", "keyword": "China and the world order", "website": "the Washington Post", "author": "", "content": "Every week, The Post runs a collection of letters of readers\u2019 grievances \u2014 pointing out grammatical mistakes, missing coverage and inconsistencies.

But take him at one glance, or listen to him with but one ear, and you think he is saying something rather different from his real message.\u00a0And one has to read him that closely, because he wrote that precisely.\u201d\u00a0For example, in 1848, he said that \u201cany people anywhere .\u2009.\u2009. have the right to rise up, and shake off the existing government, and for a new one that suits them better.\u201d\u00a0Sounds as if the South had the right to secede. But Lincoln finished his thought: \u201cNor is this right confined to cases in which the whole people of an existing government, may choose to exercise it.\u00a0Any portion of such people that can, may revolutionize, and make their own, of so much of the territory as they inhabit.\u201d\u00a0Lincoln was saying quite precisely that if you want to secede, you can, but you will be successful only if you can stop me from preventing you. And because of his vision of a new nation dedicated to freedom, he determined to snuff out the South\u2019s idea of an independent slave empire.\u00a0ADBradley H. Bachtell, OdentonI object to the portrayal of Abraham Lincoln in the July 3 letter, \u201cLincoln\u2019s reckoning.\u201d The letter said, \u201cThe statue is arguably awful in its depiction of Lincoln lording over a formerly enslaved person.\u201dADLincoln was the least likely of our leaders to lord anything over anyone. He was a\u00a0highly moral and a singularly humble man.I think we can promote Black Lives Matter and all black interests without denigrating the man who is likely our greatest American hero. Lincoln deserves far better.Meg Chandler, Bethesda\u25cfA misleading headlineThe headline of the June 29 editorial \u201cWhy did police drug Elijah McClain?\u201d could have led readers to believe Elijah McClain was drugged by the police. The ensuing editorial posed several pertinent questions about the fatal encounter that occurred in Colorado, but nowhere did the editorial allege or offer evidence that the police administered any drugs to McClain. In fact, the editorial specifically stated that paramedics injected McClain with ketamine, a drug. The police and paramedics in this case should be held accountable if laws and policies were broken.\u00a0ADADAccuracy matters. A misleading headline diminishes the credibility of The Post. I noted that the online version of the editorial was headlined \u201cElijah McClain\u2019s death is an unspeakable outrage.\u201d With that, I agree.Alan L. Creveling, ArnoldThe writer retired as a lieutenant from the Prince George\u2019s County Police Department.\u25cfEmpty caloriesRegarding the \u201cCompetitive eater\u201d photograph that accompanied the July 4 National Digest:The message that we give to those living with poverty in our country and the rest of the world is more than shameful when we have eating contests. For years, I would try to explain that wasteful act to my students every time one of these contests popped up, and then I would feel guilty knowing that a number of my students and their families too often did not have enough food on their plates, and that they went hungry growing up.ADADI am aware that hundreds of hot dogs or pies at these contests are not going to solve the food crises anywhere. But what does it say to our kids about our country and the companies that sponsor these extravagant and needless shows?Richard Bienvenue, WashingtonThe writer is executive director emeritus of Our House Youth Home.\u25cfIntegrating important historyFor balance and to provide useful information, Theresa Vargas might have mentioned in her July 2 Metro column, \u201cWill private schools hear their black students?,\u201d that Georgetown Day School was founded in 1945 as the first school in D.C. to racially integrate its student body.Stanton E. Samenow, Falls Church\u25cfForgotten againOn June 25, 1950, South Korea was invaded by the Communist North Koreans with the support of the Soviet Union and China. More than 33,000 Americans were killed in action, 103,000 wounded, and countless are still missing in action in a conflict that helped to save the Republic of Korea.ADADAnd yet, on the 70th anniversary of the start of that war, I found only one reference to the anniversary, and that was a caption under a photograph buried on Page A14 with the article \u201cNorth Korea dials down rhetoric against South.\u201dNow, after all these years, one can better understand why it is still referred to as the \u201cForgotten War,\u201d which, in my opinion, is a disservice to those who fought, died and went missing some 70 years ago.Charles W. McGovern, Columbia\u25cfThey wrote the soundtrack of our livesAnn Hornaday\u2019s always perceptive film reviews and her coverage of film scores are spot-on. This was evident in her appreciation of Ennio Morricone, \u201cMorricone\u2019s compositions were often starring roles\u201d [Style, July 7].ADHis scores and themes, as well as those of John Williams (\u201cStar Wars,\u201d \u201cSchindler\u2019s List\u201d), Henry Mancini (\u201cMoon River\u201d), John Barry (\u201cOut of Africa\u201d), Charlie Chaplin (\u201cSmile\u201d) and countless others, not only enrich our film experience but also become the soundtrack of our lives \u2014 bringing tonal order into an increasingly disordered world.ADYolan LaPorte, Fairfax\u25cfUnderage girls, not womenThe July 3 news article \u201cAssociate of Epstein, accused of recruiting women, charged in sex abuse case\u201d was egregiously headlined. There was only one woman referenced: Ghislaine Maxwell, the alleged recruiter, groomer and abuser.\u00a0The alleged female victims were not women; they have been variously described as underage girls and minors some two dozen times. They all were children.ADAnna Guido Perrone, Burtonsville\u25cfAgeism is no jokeThe July 4 Drawing Board cartoon showing President Trump and former vice president Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee, having a loony conversation raised my concern that a necessary conversation about the mental and physical faculties of presidential candidates could slide from specific observations of two people into easy and dangerous stereotyping of the elderly.ADAs we get older, some of us do fall prey to debilitating illnesses or injuries that send us to nursing homes, and some suffer from lessened mental capacity.  But, as a newly minted octogenarian myself, I have many friends (and a spouse) who are still very sharp and active, mentally and physically. Our expected \u201chealth span\u201d is growing ever longer, and many of us still contribute our knowledge and skills to society.ADWhat presumably made the cartoon \u201cfunny,\u201d but not to me, was that it played on an image of seniors as dotty. But the issue of the candidates\u2019 fitness to govern has little to do, in this case, with their ages.By now, we know that the president has been a narcissist and racist most of his career.\u00a0Biden has had a tendency all his career to say things he later needs to explain. Age has nothing to do with it, except that, ironically, the president repeatedly throws the ageist stereotype at his opponent to see if it sticks.ADIf the candidates were in an ethnic or religious minority, you wouldn\u2019t run a cartoon showing them behaving like stereotypes, and I urge you to show that restraint in discussions of age.Fred Weingarten, Annapolis\u25cfRetire this tired tropeWhenever The Post mentions Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.), it virtually always refers to him as \u201cthe only black Republican senator.\u201d\u00a0One example: \u201cTrump promotes video of supporter saying \u2018white power\u2019 \u201d [Politics & the Nation, June 29]. It\u2019s as though The Post has some kind of auto-correct that automatically inserts this phrase every time Scott\u2019s name is mentioned. The implications seem to be that this fact says something scandalous about Republicans, and that, in contrast, the Democrats have many more black senators. In fact, the Democrats have \u201conly\u201d one more, for a grand total of \u201conly\u201d two. If there is anything scandalous, it is the latter figure. Given the percentage of the Democratic electorate that is black, one would think there would be five or more black Democratic senators. Nor is the present total an aberration. New York has never had an elected black senator.\u00a0Famously liberal Massachusetts has had one elected black senator, but he was a Republican. Maryland has never had an elected black senator. Nor has Connecticut. Sen. Cory Booker is a first for New Jersey. Likewise Sen. Kamala D. Harris from California.\u00a0Only Illinois has had two elected black senators, though none now.\u00a0I think it\u2019s long past time for The Post to retire the phrase \u201conly black Republican senator.\u201dADDavid W. Stanley, Washington\u25cfMillions of Betty CrockersMegan McArdle\u2019s July 6 op-ed, \u201cBetty Crocker, pandemic muse,\u201d brought back sweet memories of my mother-in-law, Ruth Silcox, a very early Betty Crocker and one of the women who pioneered the acceptance of working women. She\u00a0earned a master\u2019s degree in foods (and minored in chemistry) and worked in the test kitchen for General Mills from 1934 to 1935, testing hundreds of submitted recipes and holding classes as a Betty Crocker.She said many people submitted \u201cMother\u2019s\u201d recipes, complaining that they did not taste good \u2014 like Mother\u2019s.\u00a0When they were tested, my mother-in-law said many of these recipes did not taste good, probably because the mother had left out a necessary ingredient \u2014 a favorite trick of many cooks.The Betty Crocker cookbooks were developed by professional women in a male-dominated business, sometimes without the appreciation they deserved. Two of the women who developed the 1950 cookbook were Janette Kelley and Marjorie Child Husted, and they had to fight a good battle. Many young cooks thank\u00a0them for their efforts.\u00a0Judie Silcox, MontclairComfort and joy were my immediate responses when I opened the July 6 newspaper and saw a photograph of Betty Crocker\u2019s Picture Cook Book!\u00a0Megan McArdle\u2019s recollections about Betty Crocker history and her wonderful recipes stirred up lovely memories of my own.\u00a0Before I knew it, I was transported back to the 1960s in Griffith, Ind., to our turquoise kitchen equipped with a Formica-and-chrome table.\u00a0There, my 6-year-old self was at my dear mother\u2019s side as she lovingly prepared another meal from her trusted daily companion \u2014 her Betty Crocker Cook Book.Thanks for giving me such a sweet recipe to escape our current reality even for a bit.\u00a0I think Betty Crocker would highly approve!Linda Glumac Carey, Spencerville\u25cfHe didn't deserve 'it'The July 4 National Digest included a short article about a cougar captured in San Francisco last month and released only to be hit by a car [\u201cCougar\u00a0that roamed streets is found dead\u201d]. Although the item noted that the cougar was \u201ca young male,\u201d the article referred to him as \u201cit,\u201d except once when it mentioned that while in the city he was seen \u201clooking at his reflection in the glass of office towers.\u201dAny animal sentient enough to recognize his own reflection is not simply an object but a thinking, self-aware life form that deserves more than to be hit by a thoughtless speeder who didn\u2019t even bother to stop. And he deserved to be called \u201chim,\u201d not \u201cit.\u201dThere is great power in journalism to shape attitudes, and the language used is important. Humans may never evolve to fully respect nonhumans as much as they should until we stop thinking of them as mere objects.David Bernazani, Ashburn\u25cfA newspaper that feels like homeThe June 28 Washington Post Magazine article on Stars and Stripes newspaper, \u201cStars\u00a0and\u00a0Stripes\u00a0has long supported the troops. Will Congress support the paper?,\u201d\u00a0took me down memory lane. My first overseas Foreign Service posting was to the U.S. consulate in Adana, Turkey. In those days, State Department \u201ccables\u201d really went by undersea cable. My best news sources were two-day-old Herald-Tribunes airmailed from Paris, BBC World News shortwave from Nicosia, Cyprus, and the daily Stars and Stripes from Incirlik Air Base, six miles away. Only Stars and Strips felt like home. On subsequent tours in Ankara, Turkey; Athens; Saigon; and Istanbul, Washington was an official phone call away. But still, only Stars and Stripes felt like home. It would be a true tragedy for official American families assigned abroad, and stupid, if its funding were cut.Terrence G. Grant,\u00a0Potomac Falls\u25cfShe has a nameI thought The Post knew better by now.\u00a0Her name is Nancy K. Kopp, and she is treasurer of Maryland.The photograph that accompanied the June 30 Metro article \u201cHogan outlines budget revision\u201d depicted the\u00a0three members of the Maryland Board of Public Works. Perhaps The Post thought name cards visible in the photograph were sufficient for identification purposes, but there was plenty of room in the caption to identify all three people in the photograph.\u00a0\u00a0For the record, they were: Maryland Treasurer Nancy K. Kopp (D), Gov. Larry Hogan (R) and Comptroller Peter Franchot (D).S.C. Hudson, North Bethesda\u25cfMonumental achievementsThe July 5 Retropolis article \u201cStart of Washington Monument drew 40,000 on Independence Day 1848\u201d [Metro], \u00a0about the idea for, construction and dedication of the Washington Monument, was a masterful telling of that long 86-year period (1799-1885), especially interesting these days, when monuments are coming down so quickly. More information about architect Robert Mills, however, would have enhanced the back story. Mills was born and educated in South Carolina, moved to Washington in 1800 and worked for Benjamin Latrobe, the architect of the Capitol. Mills is one of the earliest American-born and -trained architects. The \u201cgrandiose vision\u201d of Mills\u2019s first design proposal for a monument in Washington can be traced to the design of the Washington Monument in Baltimore, completed in 1829 and the first major monument to George Washington.\u00a0The monument in Baltimore is a 178-foot Greek Doric column with a square viewing platform near the top. At the top, it has a  16-foot marble statue of George Washington by Enrico Causici, who also worked on the U.S. Capitol.Despite the many artistic qualities of the monument in Baltimore and the relative plainness of the tall obelisk in Washington, the Washington Monument in D.C. has overshadowed the monument Mills designed for Baltimore. Mills died in Washington on March 3, 1855, less than two weeks after the dedication of his more famous Washington Monument.Francis J. Gorman, Baltimore\u25cfThe heart of the matterI had a great deal of trouble with the June 30 Politics & the Nation article \u201cHouse passes major ACA expansion.\u201d I was surprised by the headline and eagerly read the first, then the second and subsequent\u00a0paragraphs to see what bill had been passed and what Affordable Care Act items were \u201cexpanded.\u201dThe sixth paragraph finally stated three ways in which the new legislation would affect the ACA.\u00a0A further six paragraphs later, more detail began to flesh out the matter. I must also say that, throughout the article, it was a bit challenging to decipher whether the text referred to the original ACA or to this new bill.I am sorry to be citing dissatisfaction here, but when one has\u00a0to plow through so many paragraphs to get to the news in the headline, it\u00a0is just not right. An earlier statement of the essence of the article should be a standard reporter template. Many\u00a0reporters manage to do this. It is a courtesy to the reader. It would also be helpful to give the name of the bill and its number when writing about bills in Congress or in a state legislature.Elaine Emling, Silver SpringRead more: Readers critique The Post: Enough, already.

Subscribe today.arrow-rightThe statement was a rare admission from Trump that all is not well with the response to the virus by his administration, which has rejected the advice of scientific experts, been reluctant to take responsibility and has issued contradictory and at times divisive public messaging.As he convened the first White House coronavirus task force briefing in weeks, the president struck a newly somber and pessimistic tone. After months of playing down the virus and the dangers of its resurgence, Trump said his acknowledgment that the situation will worsen is \u201csomething I don\u2019t like saying about things, but that\u2019s the way it is. That\u2019s what we have.\u201dADADAt the briefing, he asked the American public to wear masks after weeks of resisting to do so himself in public. \u201cWhether you like the mask or not, they have an impact, they\u2019ll have an effect, and we need everything we can get,\u201d Trump said.But Trump also took a defensive posture, refusing to take responsibility for America\u2019s current status as the country with the world\u2019s highest number of coronavirus cases by far. Even adjusted for population, the United States has notched more cases than China and most countries in Europe and Latin America.\u201cI\u2019m working with governors. We\u2019re working hand-in-hand. I think we\u2019re all responsible,\u201d Trump said.The briefing represented a notable shift by the president, who has spent recent weeks largely focused on other subjects, such as cutting regulations. Aides have said he stopped attending coronavirus task force meetings because he did not have time.ADADHis resurrection of the task force\u2019s daily briefings comes as the number of daily cases has spiked and as Trump\u2019s approval ratings have plummeted.On Tuesday, the United States recorded more than 1,000 new deaths, the first time the country has topped that mark in nearly 50\u2008days. It was the highest single-day death total since June 2, when 1,052 fatalities were reported, and the milestone undercut Trump\u2019s claims during the news briefing of a fast-falling mortality rate.Tuesday\u2019s death number was lower than in the pandemic\u2019s darkest days in April, when the virus regularly claimed upward of 2,000 lives in 24 hours. But the average number of daily deaths has been rising steadily for most of July, according to data compiled and analyzed by The Washington Post. And experts warn that the daily death toll \u2014 which lags by weeks behind infections and hospitalizations \u2014 is likely to rise sharply in the coming month.ADADStates that had rushed to reopen quickly \u2014 Arizona, Florida and Texas \u2014 led the nation in reported deaths Tuesday, each posting more than 130. Georgia, where the governor has chastised local officials over mask orders, reported 78. In California, where state leaders have been comparably cautious, 61 deaths were reported.The nation continues to struggle with a wily pathogen that can produce no symptoms at all in some people, even as it sickens and kills tens of thousands of others. Large swaths of the nation remain in turmoil as many communities debate how to reopen schools this fall, wrestle with rising virus-related hospitalizations and, in some cases, roll back restrictions to restart a flailing economy.Amid the rising numbers, the country\u2019s response to the virus remains in disarray. Many governors continue to resist calls from experts to mandate the wearing of masks.ADADNone of the federal government\u2019s top public health experts, such as Surgeon General Jerome M. Adams or coronavirus response coordinator Deborah Birx, were permitted to talk at Trump\u2019s briefing Tuesday.Notably absent was the nation\u2019s top infectious-disease expert, Anthony S. Fauci, who has been attacked by Trump and others in the White House as Fauci has continued pushing for stricter safety measures nationwide. And it is unclear how great a voice scientists and experts will have in guiding the federal government\u2019s response.In a CNN interview an hour before the White House news conference, Fauci said he had not been invited to the briefing. In a weekend interview, Trump called Fauci \u201ca little bit of an alarmist\u201d and alleged Fauci had \u201cmade some mistakes.\u201dADAsked about the president\u2019s criticism, Fauci said, \u201cI consider myself more a realist than an alarmist. But you know people do have their opinions other than that.\u201dADOther top White House officials have harshly disparaged Fauci, who remains one of the most trusted officials in the Trump administration, according to polls.After a long period of no interactions with the president, Fauci said he was able to brief Trump toward the end of last week. He continued urging government officials and the public to take greater action against the virus.The precarious situation the country finds itself in was underscored Tuesday by new data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showing that the number of actual coronavirus infections is likely far higher \u2014 by two to 13 times \u2014 than reported cases.ADThe new study gave details on the undercount: In Missouri, the estimated number of actual infections was 13 times greater than confirmed cases. In Utah, it was at least twice as high.ADThe higher estimate is based on a study on antibodies, which indicate who has had the virus. The number of reported cases in the United States stands at 3.8 million.The CDC also reported that only a small proportion of people in many parts of the country had antibodies to the coronavirus as of this spring, meaning most of the population remains highly susceptible to the virus.Amid that gloomy background, a glimmer of hope emerged Tuesday as pharmaceutical executives told Congress they hope to have vaccines with some sort of regulatory approval by the fall.AD\u201cIt\u2019s a difficult question to answer in terms of probabilities,\u201d Mene Pangalos,\u00a0an executive vice president at\u00a0AstraZeneca, told a House subcommittee on oversight and investigations, when asked about the likelihood that a vaccine would be available by year\u2019s end. \u201cIf we have efficacy data, we hope it will happen anytime from September onward.\u201dADBiotechnology company Moderna said a vaccine would be possible by fall. Executives from\u00a0Pfizer said their firm could deliver up to 100 million doses in 2020 and up to 1.3 billion in 2021. Janssen \u00adVaccines, part of pharmaceutical giant\u00a0Johnson & Johnson, said it would start its large trial in September and hoped to have results by early 2021 \u2014 and 100\u2008million doses by the end of March. Merck executives said their company did not anticipate a vaccine until sometime in 2021 at the earliest.\u201cWe\u2019re definitely taking positive steps in the right direction in the vaccine data,\u201d said Eleanor Murray, assistant professor of epidemiology at Boston University. But she and others cautioned it is still early in the vaccine development process. \u201cWe obviously are going to have to wait and see for bigger trials to be done.\u201dADAt Tuesday\u2019s briefing, even as he acknowledged the growing case numbers, Trump painted a rosy picture of his administration\u2019s response. Of supplies needed to combat the virus, Trump said, \u201cwe again have tremendous amounts of supplies. We are in very good shape.\u201d But hospitals, nurses and local health officials say they are encountering shortages of N95 masks, gowns and gloves.ADTrump boasted of the millions of tests being conducted, even as labs say they are being overwhelmed and test results in some states are taking up to 10 days to turn around, rendering them useless for combating the virus.When asked whether he supported funding for testing now being debated in Congress, Trump was noncommittal. \u201cIf the doctors and the professionals feel that \u2014 even though we\u2019re at a level that nobody ever dreamt possible \u2014 they would like to do more, I\u2019m okay with it,\u201d he said.On Tuesday, the White House and Senate Republicans struggled to settle on a unified coronavirus budget plan, lacking any agreement on policy goals, budget parameters or even deadlines.The Republican and White House positions changed multiple times as the day went on, with some GOP lawmakers refusing to rally behind the White House\u2019s demand for a payroll tax cut while others worked to convince Trump\u2019s emissaries that more money was needed for testing and the CDC.Other Republican lawmakers appeared mortified about the growing size of the spending bill, bickering over which policies to remove and warning that miscalculations could allow Democrats to seize control of the White House and Senate in November.White House spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany said Tuesday that the White House is seeking \u201ctargeted\u201d money for testing, saying that \u201cwe\u2019re willing to put in money for targeted testing that makes sense, not just dumping money into a pot that contains $10\u00a0billion.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJacqueline Dupree, Seung Min Kim, Jeff Stein and Erica Werner contributed to this report.", "comment": "74 Comments", "topic": "Health"}, {"cover": "", "title": "Chasing Cancer 2020", "date": "Jul 16, 2020", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/washington-post-live/2020/07/16/chasing-cancer-2020/", "keyword": "China and the world order", "website": "the Washington Post", "author": "", "content": "MS. SELLERS: Good morning. I'm Frances Stead Sellers, a senior writer at The Washington Post, pleased to welcome you to the second installment of Chasing Cancer 2020, in which we talk to leading oncologists about curing a disease that affects so many people around the world.Support our journalism. Subscribe today.arrow-rightMy first guess this morning is one such expert, Dr. Ned Sharpless, who is the Director of the National Cancer Institute. Welcome, Dr. Sharpless. Thank you very much for joining us this morning.You have written that there could be as many as 10,000 extra deaths as a result of delays in screening and care during the coronavirus pandemic. How did you get to that number?DR. SHARPLESS: So, we estimated using a network of modeling experts that we have here at the National Cancer Institute. They have a sophisticated way of predicting cancer incidence and mortality in the future, using models that have been extensively validated for other purposes. And so, we asked them to estimate, you know, if a few kinds of things happened, like, we had less screening and less treatment of new cancers, what would that effect be on cancer incidence and mortality, for colon and breast cancer, where the models are most advanced and sophisticated. And using that approach we found that there would likely be about 10,000 excess deaths, from those two cancers alone, over the next decade. So that's about a 1 percent increase in excess deaths for those types of cancers.ADADWe started this effort a while ago, early on in the pandemic, and now we know more, and I think our initial assumptions about the disruption to care from the pandemic work are very conservative. In other words, I think the pandemic has actually provided more disruptions than we modeled in.So, for example, our modeling assumed a reduction of colonoscopy and mammography, those screening tests for cancer, on the order of 75 percent, but now we believe those disruptions have even been greater than that in many places. And similarly, we assumed a six-month kind of delay in treatment, and we think that might be greater in many places as well too.MS. SELLERS: So, do you foresee other major public health crises as a result of this pandemic in coming years?ADDR. SHARPLESS: Right. I don't think there's anything, you know, special or unique about cancer care with regard to the public health issues that the pandemic presents. You know, hospitals have been shut down to all things but coronavirus. They've stopped a lot of their normal clinical procedures. They've stopped everything they call \"elective,\" which an elective procedure may be a very significant and medically necessary procedure. It's just one you can defer for a little bit of time.ADBut, you know, we think that the problems that we're seeing in delayed diagnosis and delayed treatment of cancer will also play out in other non-cancer diseases, like heart disease and stroke and neurodegenerative disorders. And so, the things that are problems for Americans, if they're not delayed and treated--if they're not diagnosed and treated in a timely fashion, we expect that will be back. That will have public health consequences in lots of diseases.MS. SELLERS: So, what should the cancer industry be doing? What should doctors be doing to try to mitigate these impacts?ADDR. SHARPLESS: Well, I want to say, you know, first of all it's important to note that we've made a lot of progress in cancer over the last few decades, and our ability to treat it and care for it are much better than they've ever been, and this year we're seeing a record number of new therapies make it into clinical use, through FDA approval and other means. And so, there's this real great backdrop of progress, and now the pandemic has provided this new challenge against that backdrop of progress.ADAnd so, I believe, you know, we have to collectively, as a group of cancer doctors, researchers, and caregivers, you know, get together and, you know, take collective action to prevent our patients from suffering needlessly from the pandemic. And I think there are things we can do. We can be innovative in how we provide care. We're moving things to telehealth, you know, doing some areas of care over the phone that we used to do in person. We're being clever about how we do clinical trials. We're incorporating new modalities for therapy earlier and at different stages.So, I think through research and science and collective action we can mitigate the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on cancer patients, but we have to do that because we don't want to change one public health crisis for another.ADMS. SELLERS: Right. Do you see any advantages in this slowing down of screenings, biopsies, or any of these issues? They raise false negatives sometimes and that causes problems of their own. Are there any benefits that could come from this sort of intense behavioral experiment we've all been forced into?ADDR. SHARPLESS: Right. I think that the most obvious benefit of delaying these sorts of elective procedures and screenings that you mentioned is that we preserve hospital capacity so that it won't be overwhelmed from coronavirus patients. And that's prudent and wise and totally appropriate in specific geographic regions in the country. No one wants to see hospitals become overwhelmed. And you're right. There is some diagnosis and screening that finds indolent cancer that is less likely to be clinically significant.But having said that, in general, these cancer screening approaches we have, and particularly the diagnosis of symptomatic patients with new symptoms of cancer, that's really important and leads to therapy that is very effective. And to not do that for a prolonged period of time, we think, will be mostly, in aggregate, bad to quite bad for our patients if we can't do something about it.ADMS. SELLERS: So, my colleague, Laurie McGinley, wrote a story this week about the challenges doctors are facing wooing patients back into their offices. How would you advise people in hard-hit states like Florida or in Arizona about the need for screenings or primary care appointments before they even get to cancer treatment?ADDR. SHARPLESS: Right. I think it's important for patients to--you know, this is why this is challenging, because it involves some nuance. You have to communicate relative risk. And going to the doctor in one part of the country for a routine screening exam might be totally safe today, whereas in other parts of the country it might not be a good idea. So local advice from your caregiver is the first issue.Doing things over the phone or through other modalities that we used to do in person is a good idea. And then the good habits around social distancing and masking and these sorts of things that we know have public health benefit, should you have to go out and see your doctor, is important.ADThere are things that can be postponed. We know that treatments and screenings of certain areas in cancer can be delayed a little while, but not indefinitely. And we do know, for patients with, for example, certain kinds of cancer, the risk of their cancer not getting optimal treatment is far greater to them than the risk of catching coronavirus, for example. So, some people have certain kinds of cancer that really needs treatment, where we have effective therapies, and delaying that because of a fear of going out is not in their best interest.ADMS. SELLERS: You've mentioned telemedicine a couple of times, and I've spoken to many other doctors in ERs and places, and they've surprised me with what can be done through telemedicine now. Tell us how it works in cancer treatment.DR. SHARPLESS: Yeah. This has been an amazing development, and I think if there is sort of something we've learned from the pandemic that I think will be of benefit going forward it's around this topic. You know, overnight doctors, in all specialties, including oncology, have learned--you know, have been given the ability to do telemedicine for lots of clinical situations. And it's been widely embraced, because we've had to embrace it. We've had to use this. And I think the medical community has been very creative and ingenious about how to use telemedicine, and there are lots of things that one can do by telemedicine that wasn't obvious we could do that way before.ADSo, for example, in oncology we've moved a lot of the clinical trials that we do, you know, for novel therapeutics, into telemedicine, meaning you can talk to the doctor about this new therapy by phone, you can consent to the trial by phone, never coming in to the doctor's office, and then the drugs can get mailed to you without you actually having to leave your home. So, we can do something very complex and challenging, like enrollment in a clinical trial, effectively by telehealth.ADSo, you know, telehealth has really changed how we deliver care, and I, for one, believe it's here to stay. I don't think our patients are going to want to go back to the era when they had to see their doctor for everything. But having said that, you can't do chemotherapy infusion by telemedicine. You can't do a mammogram by telemedicine. You can't do a colonoscopy by telemedicine. We're still going to need doctors' visits, and we have to be innovative to solve that problem, too.MS. SELLERS: So, one of the groups that has been sort of largely spared the worst part of the coronavirus pandemic is still having to go through cancer treatment, and that's children. What have been the special concerns for you about pediatric cancer patients through this crisis?ADDR. SHARPLESS: Right. Well, you know, several concerns. The first is that the children who have addressable, curable cancers get the proper treatment, so that their care isn't displaced by, you know, some other aspect of pandemic response. You know, that's true for all patients with cancer, but particularly in pediatric oncology, where many of the patients have a very good prognosis with proper treatment. So, you know, not interrupting care, delaying care, or decreasing curative care, you know, those things that one might be tempted to do because of the pandemic, we need to press on and make sure they get full therapy.ADSecondly, that the patients aren't put at risk, that they are seen when they need to be seen in a way that minimizes their chance of contracting coronavirus. We think that kids, in general, have a lower risk for bad outcome when infected by coronavirus. But, you know, children with a weakened immune system from cancer therapy we still believe are a vulnerable population, and we want to protect them from any infection, including this kind of viral infection.The hospitals that treat a lot of children are being quite innovative. They're testing a lot of people. They're limiting contact. They're doing things through, you know, these new approaches we discussed. So, I think we can provide high-quality pediatric oncology care during the pandemic.MS. SELLERS: Yeah, and limiting visitors, which must be particularly hard for families who have children in hospitals.One of the other issues that is demanding a lot of time on the clinical side, or research side, is the coronavirus vaccine, which is slowing other clinical trials. How do you see the impact in your particular field?DR. SHARPLESS: Well, you know, clinical trials in oncology have really been slowed by the pandemic. I don't think because--the vaccine trials are not to blame for that. I mean, it's a number of reasons. But cancer clinical trials, maybe at the worst they were down about--our NCI trials were down about 50 percent at the worst period, early in the pandemic. They've now recovered somewhat. We're still down substantially from our usual accrual rates, but we have seen some modest recovery from the nadir of 50 percent.It's even worse--that's for therapeutic trials that like test a new drug in a patient, for example. We have other nontherapeutic trials--we do screening trials and quality-of-life trials -- those are even more affected, so their accrual is down to a greater extent. We've also heard from our industry colleagues, you know, the pharmaceutical companies that pay for clinical trials in cancer patients, that their trial accrual is more affected even than ours.So, the clinical trials engine has been, you know, compromised severely by coronavirus, and we have been trying to work flexibly with the FDA and our investigators to provide means to resume clinical trials activity, despite the pandemic. As I said, we're having some success, but still we need to build that capacity, because clinical trials really are how you make progress for patients with cancer, and we can't afford to have those efforts delayed.MS. SELLERS: And how are you making those trials as inclusive as possible, getting to as broad a part of the population as you can?DR. SHARPLESS: Right. So, you know, testing new therapies and new clinical trial ideas in representative populations is absolutely critical for a number of reasons. It assures that therapies are generalizable to a real-world population, but I think it's also just a part of good care. We know that clinical trials access is a surrogate marker or a proxy, if you will, for high-quality oncology care. And so, if certain populations aren't getting access to clinical trials, that's a sign that something is wrong in the clinical trials enterprise. And the NCI has really focused, along with the FDA, a lot of attention to trying to make clinical trials enrollment more diverse and inclusive.Probably the mechanism that we've had that's been most successful at the National Cancer Institute is to spread accrual throughout the country. So, through our National Community Oncology Research program, the NCOR network, we can enroll patients at 1,100 sites nationally. And some of those sites are predominantly serving vulnerable or underserved populations, and therefore may have more success in diversity in clinical trials enrollment.MS. SELLERS: So, stepping back a bit, the U.S. has long been praised for some of the huge advances in personalized medicine and very targeted care that you're talking about, and criticized for its lack of investment in public health, and now we're paying the price. Even cancer patients are paying the price for that lack of investment. Can we do both going ahead? Should there be a recalibration in where money is being spent? What's your overview of these two contrasting approaches to health care?DR. SHARPLESS: Yes, I think both in my job at the National Cancer Institute and my work at the FDA, it's clear that, you know, you can't go it alone with just therapy of disease. One needs preventative public health approaches that have to be very robust and well organized, and no doubt the current pandemic has provided serious public health challenges for our country and every nation, frankly.We have to diagnose and prevent disease in a way that is very nimble and can meet unexpected challenges in the future. I think that we can do both, and, frankly, we have to do both.MS. SELLERS: Yeah. I have a question from a reader, or a listener, that I'd like to read out to you. This is from Matthew DeAngelis from California, who asks, \"What has been the impact of the $900 million funding cut from the National Cancer Institute?\"DR. SHARPLESS: Right. I suspect Matthew is referring to a cut in our funding in the president's--one of the president's proposed budgets in prior years. However, the last few years the actual funding to the increase--the actual funding to the National Cancer Institute has increased, looking, you know, from both an increase of our base budget as well as new initiatives like the Cancer Moonshot and the Childhood Cancer conference and the Data Initiative, the CCDI.So, the NCI has enjoyed pretty good support from appropriations in Congress over the years that I've been at the NCI, since 2017. We don't know what's going to happen for funding in 2021 yet. It's a very interesting appropriations year. But I think what I've found, as NCI director, is that there is widespread support for cancer research in the United States, and that includes Congress. When I go and speak to members of Congress on either side of the aisle, regardless of political persuasion, people just want to do better with cancer and they want to support the NCI. And so, I think we've really benefitted from that strong support.MS. SELLERS: So, you're optimistic about the budget in 2021?DR. SHARPLESS: Hopeful. Hopeful. You know, I don't think we--it's a very interesting time with the pandemic. There's this talk about supplementary funding, a fifth supplement, for example, and then the 2021 appropriation. So, there are a lot of moving parts. Appropriations is complex every year, and this year is like no other.MS. SELLERS: Yeah. So, talk about moving parts, how do you see there should be realignments in the health care system, you know, based on what we've learned from COVID-19? What should change going ahead? What are your druthers, as you look at the big system? You've seen it from the head of the NCI and also as FDA commissioner.DR. SHARPLESS: Yeah. I think that we--when this is said and done and when life returns to a bit more normal, we're going to take a hard look at what we did well and didn't do so well during this pandemic. I think there will be a lot of interest about how we use data and collect data from our citizens. I think that, you know, the public health opportunities there are tremendous. I think there will be interest in particularly how we reach these vulnerable populations. So, it doesn't do a cancer patient or a coronavirus patient any good to have a new way to screen, diagnose, or treat their problem if you can't get that therapy or new approach disseminated into the places where people live, to reach these populations.You know, we've seen the cost of that here. The impact of the coronavirus on African American patients, on Hispanic patients is disproportionate. And that is no surprise to oncologists, because the same disparities exist in cancer. But those create problems that we will have to, as a society, address.MS. SELLERS: So, we've had a number of readers writing in to talk about the lack of affordability of some of the most specialized treatments. What would your advice be to the federal government to try to make those treatments more broadly accessible?DR. SHARPLESS: You know, drug pricing is one of the big problems in cancer research. I mentioned the good news, that we're making a lot of progress and that we're developing these new therapies, and we have this whole new paradigm of cancer research that's been very effective, allowing us to make really meaningful advances for patients over the last years. But those new therapies come at a tremendous cost. They are very expensive. No one with cancer should be forced to choose between their drug costs and their mortgage, or their rent, for example.So, you know, we have to, as a society, figure out how to develop these new therapies, reward these scientists and innovators who come up with these new therapies, because we still need new innovation. We still have a lot of bad cancer that doesn't have a good treatment. But at the same time, then make those new therapies and new ways of diagnosing and preventing cancer available to everyone, regardless of the ability to pay.And it is a real challenge. I think we want to, you know, provide the innovation for which the United States has been so successful in the pharmaceutical drug discovery side, but at the same time, you know, really be fair to patients and recognize that these drugs are preclusively expensive. Just the co-pays for these drugs can be preclusively expensive. And so, I think we have to collectively do better.But I will say it is a true statement that having no therapy for a disease, no approach to it, is a much worse problem than having an effective therapy that is too expensive, because an expensive therapy can be made more cheaply someday, but having no therapy at all can be scientifically intractable.So, I'm overly--overall I am optimistic that we can both take better care of our patients and bring the prices down of these drugs where they are affordable.MS. SELLERS: You were acting FDA commissioner for about eight months in 2019. If the pandemic had emerged then, how would you have approached it differently?DR. SHARPLESS: I mean, you know, it's impossible to Monday morning quarterback a situation like this. As I mentioned, there has never been really a public health emergency in the United States like this, and there is no playbook for this. I want to compliment the professional staff at the FDA. You know, the people that work there are brilliant and creative and committed to public health, and I think that they moved with great swiftness in agency to try and address the pandemic using the authorities and knowledge they had, although, of course, you know, information initially was quite imperfect.But I think it's a really talented group of people. I have been very impressed how they have risen to the challenges of vaccine and drug development during the pandemic, as well as the development of new diagnostics. And, you know, I can't say that I would have done anything differently. It's impossible to predict.But I think the pandemic has stretched that agency, as it stretched all areas of government, because it has really been a tough situation, and we don't have prior experience on which to base our actions.MS. SELLERS: And what's your best guess on when we'll get a vaccine?DR. SHARPLESS: You know, I think when we'll get a vaccine is the issue. You know, what I learned about vaccines, as FDA commissioner, is that they have to be very safe. They are among the needs for them to be the most safest medicines that we use, because you want to give them to lots and lots of people, many of whom aren't sick, you know, who don't really feel like they need it, right? So that's the social compact of herd immunity is you need to vaccinate a lot of people, though not everyone feels like they need that medicine.So, safety is paramount, and that's really hard to predict. You know, if these many different vaccines that are in trials right now turn out to have great safety data, then this could go pretty quickly. You know, the pace of the drug development, the development pipeline here, has been unprecedented, to get human phase III trials going so quickly is really amazing. But if the safety has an unexpected surprise, this could take a while.I think the data I've seen thus far, from the few vaccines that have published much, look very encouraging in their ability to induce immune response, and I think they have to be effective, but we'll have to stay tuned. I think predicting a process like this is just very hard to handicap.MS. SELLERS: So just before we finish, I'd love to ask you about the biggest and most ambitious or change that you see coming. Where do you place your hope now in cancer treatment? What's the next thing that you think could make a big advance, despite the coronavirus?DR. SHARPLESS: Well, I mean, I think the overwhelming change in cancer research during my lifetime as a cancer researcher and cancer doctor has been related to this new paradigm that cancer is not one disease or ten diseases but it's hundreds of diseases, or thousands of diseases, and that each one of those kinds of cancer needs its own therapy, its own treatment, its own method of preventing it.So I think that this move to not think of cancer as, you know, one big entity, the way we think of other diseases, but to limit it to, you know, lots and lots of different heterogeneous diseases, and then treat them one by one, has been really effective. It is working. That paradigm has allowed us to make great progress.And so, you can't really say, you know, what's the one thing that's going to work for those like million different things, because liver cancer is going to need something different from breast cancer and colon cancer. And even within something like breast cancer there are many, many different kinds of breast cancer, and they are all going to need their own specific therapy. And so, figuring those out, one by one, and working on treatments for each specific entity, that has been very successful, and I expect that paradigm to continue for a while.So, I think the progress we've seen in cancer over the last decades will continue, although as we started at the beginning, the pandemic is going to set things back for a little while.MS. SELLERS: Dr. Sharpless, thank you very much for joining us today. I really appreciated that, and we all learned a lot from your comments.We will have a short sponsor break now, and then I will be back with Maryland Governor Larry Hogan to talk about his own experience with cancer, as well as some of the challenges of governing the blue state of Maryland. Thank you.DR. SHARPLESS: Thank you so much for having me today.[Video plays]MS. LABOTT: Good morning. I'm Elise Labott of American University, and I'm joined by Andy Schmeltz, global president and general manager of Pfizer Oncology. And we're going to broaden the discussion out now to talk about some of the barriers and inequities in the current healthcare system and how we fix them to build a stronger, more resilient system. Andy, thanks for joining me.MR. SCHMELTZ: Thanks, Elise. Very pleased to be here.MS. LABOTT: Now everyone's been discussing how COVID-19 has been this, you know, defining event that disrupted every aspect of our lives. What, in your opinion, is the most important thing it's taught us when it comes to the healthcare system?MR. SCHMELTZ: COVID clearly has been a watershed moment. It's exposed and exacerbated major shortcomings in our healthcare system. It's had a disproportionate impact on older people, lower-income communities, and people of color. And this unfortunate pandemic and the rise of deadly diseases like cancer show that what we need is a strong healthcare system. And the reality is, unfortunately, while we've seen great advances in science and technology that are moving at hyper-speed, our healthcare is woefully outdated. Change is what's needed. And it's my hope that this unfortunate global pandemic will be a catalyst for change that's longer overdue.MS. LABOTT: Okay. So woefully outdated. Change is needed. But what are the biggest challenges, in your view, that prevent the healthcare system from working?MR. SCHMELTZ: I think there's two major problems. First, the current incentives in today's system are all about more: more physician visits, more tests, more pills. What we need is a mindset shift that incentivizes value or volume and quality or quantity. What really aligns everyone across the healthcare system is the patient. So, we need incentives that can be realigned around outcomes for the patient.And the second problem is that today there simply is inadequate access to, and affordability of, healthcare services and treatments. Too many people can't afford their treatments or face barriers to timely and optimal care due to their age, their race, or where they live. For example, black Americans have the highest overall cancer mortality rates compared to other racial or ethnic groups. And age is the greatest risk factor for developing cancer, yet many older people with cancer don't even receive guideline-based care. So, at a time when racism is at the center of our national conversation, change must come. We need to strive for the highest quality outcomes for everyone, regardless of their circumstances.MS. LABOTT: Okay, so there's a lot to unpack there. There's age. There's race. There's also, as you and I have discussed, location. You know, rural patients versus people in urban areas where there are more advanced care. What are some of the solutions that you're talking about at Pfizer and just among your colleagues in the industry to fix the current system?MR. SCHMELTZ: So certainly, there are many ways we can tackle this problem. But there are three solutions that are top of mind for me. One, we need to rethink health plan benefit designs that currently push more and more of a medicine's cost onto the patient. For example, when people go to the pharmacy to pick up their prescription, many are being asked to pay 10 to 20 percent more out of their own pockets. So, we need to enact reforms that cap out of pocket costs to remove the financial burden from patients.Two, we need to embrace lower cost biosimilars. We need to expand their use in the U.S. Biosimilars, which are really generics for biologic medicines to treat cancer and other serious diseases, have the potential to save U.S. patients and taxpayers $54 billion over the next 10 years. And despite support and availability of biosimilars, the U.S. still lacks a viable marketplace because use of these biosimilars simply is not incentivized.And three, we need to tackle inequalities in care so everyone can have access to the same quality medical care. So, a person shouldn't have a greater chance of surviving cancer just because they happen to live near Memorial Sloan Kettering or the Cleveland Clinic.MS. LABOTT: Right.MR. SCHMELTZ: We need to be doing more to develop local programs for prevention and treatment in underserved areas. For example, Pfizer saw greater success in improving breast cancer screening rates for diagnosis and access to quality care for women of color in Chicago.MS. LABOTT: Right.MR. SCHMELTZ: So that's where we partnered with the Metropolitan Chicago Breast Cancer Taskforce to create community engagement programs. So, we need to see more programs like this at scale.MS. LABOTT: So, I mean, look, we're talking about big pharma here, insurance companies. These are big businesses. So how do you incentivize value over volume and make care affordable for all and also embracing these lower-cost treatments while also being mindful of the fact that you have shareholders and they're looking at the bottom line?MR. SCHMELTZ: Look, our role in society for Pfizer and for the biopharmaceutical industry, is to bring breakthroughs that change patients' lives. But the reality is, if the patients can't get access to or afford these medicines, then they're not going to realize their potential. So, we certainly recognize that we have to be part of the solution, that we have to come together. And it's really about putting the patient at the center. That's what's the common denominator across all these organizations. For-profit, not-for-profit, government, public private, we have to keep the needs of the patient front and center and allow that to guide us.MS. LABOTT: Okay. So how do you move forward with that? These are, you know, ideas I don't think anybody would argue with, but how do you get started?MR. SCHMELTZ: So, we need to get all the stakeholders in the healthcare system around the table: biopharma, insurance companies, health plans, PBMs, the provider organizations, policymakers, patient advocacy organizations. We need to, together, find sustainable ways to bring medicines to people and also eliminate waste in the system. Pfizer is certainly committed to being part of the solution. That said, it's going to be messy. It's going to be hard work. But we can't be deterred. Now more than ever we have to unite to fix the broken healthcare system.MS. LABOTT: Okay. Well, that's an invitation right there if I ever heard one to everyone in all of these industries and all of the stakeholders. Andy Schmeltz, thanks for joining me, Global president and general manager of Pfizer Oncology. And as you said, time for long overdue changes. Stay tuned. There's more of the program coming up with Frances Stead Sellers.[Video plays]MS. SELLERS: Welcome back. I'm Frances Stead Sellers, a senior writer at The Washington Post, and very pleased to welcome this morning Governor Larry Hogan, Republican from Maryland. Governor Hogan, you were in the news today with an op-ed you published in The Washington Post. I promise I'll come to that. But I would like to first start by talking to you about a topic you haven't talked very much about, and that is your experience with cancer. So welcome to the program.GOV. HOGAN: Well, thank you very much for having me.MS. SELLERS: You've just--you have a book coming out--coming out called \"Still Standing\" about not only cancer but also dealing with a pandemic, with the rioting following the death of Freddie Gray, and also with the toxic politics in the country. You were diagnosed with cancer five months after taking office. How did you receive that diagnosis of such an aggressive form of cancer?GOV. HOGAN: Well, it was--it was kind of a big surprise. I had just won, I think, the biggest surprise upset in America. I went to our first legislative session. We had survived--we had gone through the riots in Baltimore. I'd been governor for five months. We were on our first trade mission, a trip to Asia where we went to Korea, China, and Japan. And I noticed a lump in my throat. The first time I realized anything was wrong, I came back and had doctors tell me that--three doctors walk in a room and told me that I had very advanced cancer, that it spread all over my body from my neck to my groin, and that began a long saga.I first had to tell my wife and my family and then my staff and those close to me, and then I had to tell the 6 million people of my state who had just put the state in my now fairly shaky hands that--what I was going to be dealing with. And I was able to share that with folks to let them know exactly what was happening.MS. SELLERS: So, let's take those steps, step by step. You had to tell your wife, your South Korean wife, Yumi, and your three daughters, and you chose to do that before, obviously, telling others. And that was following a biopsy. Tell us about telling your family. It was an intensely difficult experience, I imagine.GOV. HOGAN: Well, you know, I think a lot of people that go through this experience with cancer, the people around them, they also suffer. And I was actually more worried about my family and how they were going to feel. I wasn't so worried about myself at first when I got this diagnosis. My first thought was, you know, how am I going to explain this to the family and how do I keep them from being too worried. I had some pretty scary news from these doctors, and the prognosis was pretty tough. You know, I had I think 50-some tumors all over my body, which was a complete surprise to me. I had some aches and pains and I'd been feeling a little run down, but I had no idea about this growing cancer in my body.And, you know, so I first--I first went home and told my wife and, you know, talked about how we were going to get through this together. It happened to be Father's Day weekend. And so, my three daughters and my son-in-laws were happening to be coming over, and we kind of shared the news with everybody. It was kind of a group hug and a little bit of tears and, you know, we all--they said what can we do. And I told them we're going to get through it together.And then, you know, my dad who was in his 80s was coming over that weekend for Father's Day. And I told him and, you know, it's--when you get this kind of news, it doesn't matter how old you were. I was still his little kid. And, I think he felt a little helpless. There was nothing he could do about this. But, you know, I think people go through these kinds of battles with cancer. You often don't think about how it impacts the rest of the family. And so, I have so much compassion for not only the people that go through these very difficult battles with cancer but the people that support them and are fighting right alongside them.But after I told my family I then, you know, had to tell the rest of the folks on my staff, the lieutenant governor and my cabinet, my--the folks that had worked so hard to put us in office and to get us off to a good start. And then I actually had to do a biopsy surgery. And after the surgery, they told me I should just go home and get some rest, and instead I held a press conference. I was still a little loopy from the medication. They advised me not to do a press conference. But I went out and told the people of Maryland exactly what was happening, that I was going to--like everyone else who battles cancer, I was just going to fight through it and work as hard as I could and continue to do the job that they had elected me to do--yeah--[Overlapping speakers]MS. SELLERS: And I was going to ask you--my apologies, Governor. I didn't mean to interrupt. But I was going to ask you about that meshing of political and personal messaging. And you went out--it's an extraordinary passage in your book. You went out to do this press conference. How did it rally people behind you? What was the response from not only the press people but those who read about and heard about or watched your press conference?GOV. HOGAN: Well, I was incredibly moved, you know, by--obviously you have the love and support of your family, but I was moved by the way that, you know, some complete strangers, you know, really rallied behind and encouraged me throughout the way. But I gave this news to the public at a packed press conference filled with reporters. You know, sometimes reporters can be a cynical bunch, and they're not often, you know, cheerleaders or big supporters of people in elected position. They usually just ask the tough questions. In this case, they did ask me some tough questions about, you know, was I going to have to resign, you know, was I going to survive this, or what would happen. Was the lieutenant governor going to take over, things like that. And I just tried to give them all the answers as straight as I could. But when I finished--when I finished the press conference, you know, I actually noticed a few of the reporters and cameramen had tears in their eyes and the whole room gave up and gave me a standing ovation. I'm not sure--I'm pretty sure I have never seen that happen again since that from a room full of reporters. But it nearly brought me to tears. And that was just the start of having tens of thousands of people out there encouraging me.MS. SELLERS: Right.GOV. HOGAN: And I've tried to do the same thing for so many other people who didn't have that kind of support or maybe people didn't know what they were going through.MS. SELLERS: Right. You write in the book very movingly about your experience in hospital. You went in for these very intense bouts of chemotherapy. And in many ways, of course, you had a very privileged approach. You were able to contact the best doctors in the state to start with. But after that, you were being treated among everybody else. And you met people--you write about the people you met, a young man with Down syndrome, a woman from the area of Baltimore that Freddie Gray came from. How has that experience affected your governing style?GOV. HOGAN: It was probably one of the things that had the biggest impact on me. I was--you know, it didn't matter if I was governor or not. I was a fellow cancer patient. And I was in--I did these very intensive rounds, I think five different types of chemo that I was getting, you know, 24 hours a day in the hospital. And I really couldn't stand laying in the hospital bed. Even though I wasn't feeling so great, I just wanted to get up and move around. You have a chemo pole with bags hanging down, and I had decided to drag that pole that had wheels on it around and do some laps around the floor of the cancer ward there. And I got a chance to meet so many of my fellow cancer patients. And, you know, one of them was a young man named Jimmy Myrick Jr. who was a young man with Down syndrome who had an incredible personality. And one of them was a woman who was from West Baltimore. But I met literally hundreds of other cancer patients. I even went down to the pediatric oncology ward to try to spend some time with the kids and their families to see what they were going through.And it's--you know, it's really made a difference in my life. And, you know, I had always cared about the issue of cancer and I had been to cancer fundraisers and supported the cause. But I really got to know some of these folks. I met some incredible kids. We did a number of events and took young kids out to some football and baseball games. We got them to meet the players, and I went and visited them in the hospital. And it's an experience that, you know, I'll never forget and I'll never stop, you know, fighting to raise awareness and raise money until we can find a cure for some of these terrible diseases.MS. SELLERS: One of the other aspects of the book I couldn't help noticing was that you were obviously left with a very comprised immune system and came out of hospital unable to shake hands readily with people. You tried the elbow bump. And in some ways, this experience was a preview, as I read it, of what we're going through now, the inability to reach out and touch people. How has that experience informed how you're managing personally and talking to other people about the pandemic, about social distancing.GOV. HOGAN: Well, I hadn't thought about that until you asked the question, but you're absolutely right. It was--it was the precursor to this. You know, this was back in 2015. And I'm a guy who really loves to get out and meet people, and I would go to crowds at, say, the Baltimore Orioles baseball game, and I'd shake hands with thousands of people and I'd hug them and I'd go to huge events. And I thrived on that and enjoyed it very much, getting out among the people across the state. And I had a very comprised immune system, not only had a cancer of the immune system but then with all the chemo driving down my white blood cells, the doctors were scared to death of me going out. And I kept ignoring their advice and going out and shaking hands and taking pictures.And I remember a time when none of the--Adam Jones, who was an outfielder for the Baltimore Orioles, gave me some batting gloves. He went in the dugout and gave me some batting gloves so I could go out and shake hands with that. But I was trying to give people elbow bumps. And this was long before the coronavirus. But now I'm doing everything I can to message to people how important it is to wear masks and not shake hands, to stay as much as you can six feet away from each other and avoid large crowds. And I hate not being able to be out in crowds, and it's very--it's still awkward to not want to shake somebody's hand when you see them, or have that kind of interaction, but it's critically important to us as we're battling the spread of this coronavirus.MS. SELLERS: You have written and published this morning this harshly critical op-ed about the way the administration has handled the crisis so far. What was your goal in telling this story, which is a combination of personal experience and political experience? Are you intending to galvanize Republicans in an anti-Trump movement? You say that the president's lack of leadership was so hopeless, and I'm reading here that it was condemning citizens of the state to suffering--more citizens of the state to suffering and death.GOV. HOGAN: Well, the--I wasn't trying--didn't have any intention at all or purpose of galvanizing anybody. I was just recounting and telling the stories as I saw them as directly and honestly as I could. I wrote most of this book and turned it into the publisher back in February, and it was due to come out several months earlier. I put it on hold and asked them to stop because we're in the middle of a crisis, and then the publisher asked--they wouldn't delay it any longer until July 28th--asked if I would add some of the--some new chapters about what we're going through right now, what we're dealing with on the coronavirus and what I've been dealing with as a governor and as chairman of the nation's governors. And this is just a very factual and honest account of my perception of what's going on.And the Washington Post ran an excerpt of that in this morning's paper. But this was early on in the crisis, where I just believed that the federal government could have and should have had a national testing strategy and that they could have taken action sooner, that the president could have been communicating more directly and more honestly with the people of America, and it would have put us in a better position.But look, I--that's a snapshot in time. We are--they have made strides. We are doing better. They are doing better on testing. They've done a good job of communicating with all of us as governors. And, look, we're all in this together and we are doing better. The federal, state and local government, we're all in this and are all trying to serve the same people and all trying to keep people safe and get our economy back on track.MS. SELLERS: I know we've reported this before, but you actually took--went to the steps of protecting supplies that you had imported to this country from the potential of their being used by the federal government instead of for Maryland citizens. How does that sit with you now? I mean, can you trust the federal government to--not to take away supplies that you had imported?GOV. HOGAN: I don't think we have that issue anymore. But, you know, in the really early stages of this crisis, there was tremendous demand for all of these lifesaving things like tests and personal protective equipment, ventilators, and very constrained supply worldwide. There was no real national strategy on any of that, and the federal government basically--I'm paraphrasing--but they basically said the states are on their own and the governors have to go out and fend for themselves. And so, we had 50 states and the territories all out there competing with one another and competing with the federal government on a national and international market trying to desperately acquire things that were very hard to find, and there wasn't enough of.And so, we took an unusual step of having to just go out on our own and acquire some tests from South Korea. And we were making sure to protect those tests. We're continuing to work with South Korea on a number of things. We've acquired some great testing machines. We just built a big lab at the University of Maryland Baltimore. We're actually getting, you know, upgraded and new and improved testing from South Korea. We have a great relationship with them. But every state was fighting for all these supplies. We were actually competing with the federal government. And in a few instances, the federal government basically stole supplies from other places. There was a situation where Governor Charlie Baker in Massachusetts had bought I think, you know, 3.6 million masks that were coming in and the federal government took the airplane and took them and shipped them somewhere else after they'd already paid for them, negotiated for them and flew them into the country. And then he had to do it all over again. I think he had to use the New England Patriots' plane to go and get another supply and bring them into his state without getting confiscated. So, we--MS. SELLERS: So, Governor Hogan, these are extraordinary, extraordinary experiences. What are the implications for your support in November 2020? What does this mean for you? Will you be supporting President Trump? Biden?GOV. HOGAN: Well, I think we're--this is really not about politics. I'm just really sharing the experiences about what we've been through, because I think people will find it interesting and I think it's important for people to have another perspective and an honest discussion about some of the things that we had to deal with. But this is not really about politics. There's been some speculation about that. We have an election to get through between now and November, but I'm really busy. I'm focused on doing my job here as governor and dealing with the twin crises of the coronavirus and our economic collapse. And I've still got a very important job to do here in Maryland until January of 2023. I think we're going to have plenty of time to talk about after November. Both parties I think are going to reexamine where they are and where we go and what we can do to move the country in a better direction.MS. SELLERS: Do you plan to run in 2024?GOV. HOGAN: I think it's far too early for that. I mean I--like I just mentioned, we shouldn't even talk about 2024 till we get past the election of 2020. And it's a long way off. Again, I've still got until 2023 to be governor and there will be plenty of time to talk about those things later. But it's really not about me trying to run for higher office. It's not the purpose of the book. I just thought I had some things to share. I hope people will find it interesting. I hope people who have been through cancer battles will find it encouraging. And maybe people will find these stories interesting about how we overcame some adversity and won some pretty big upsets and maybe accomplished some things as a Republican in the bluest state in America, through bipartisan compromise. And I just think people will find the book interesting. It wasn't any ulterior motive in writing the book.MS. SELLERS: So, going through cancer has given you an experience of the healthcare system. How do you think--and you've also had this intense experience of working with it through the coronavirus pandemic. What kinds of changes do you think are needed going ahead to make sure that we can provide the kinds of personalized care that you experienced from cancer, but also avoid the public health crisis that we've been going through?GOV. HOGAN: Well, with respect to the public health crisis, I think we've certainly learned a lot as we've gone through this. And it's not time to, you know, spend a lot of time just Monday morning quarterbacking, but I think when we get through this, we ought to look to how do we prepare for the next time that this happens, because I think being better prepared is going to help all of us. I don't think the federal government was prepared. I don't think the states were prepared. The hospital system--hospital systems weren't prepared. And we were all caught. We didn't have the--any of the necessary equipment and supplies, and we really didn't have a plan for this. And it's interesting. I mean, we kind of all knew that there was a possibility of a global pandemic, and there were some smart people that were thinking about it and planning for it, but I don't think we were ready. And hopefully next time we will be.With respect to access to quality health care, it's critically important. You know, I was lucky. I'm--not only am I governor of the state, and as a state employee we have a good health insurance plan, but I happen to be in a state where we've got some of the best health care in America and some of the best hospitals. And I was blessed with some incredible doctors and nurses and a team of people that were, you know, some of the best in the world. And not everybody has access to that, and especially where this is a discussion on cancer. When people are going through something like this, we've got to make sure that they're all able to get the treatment that they need.MS. SELLERS: Another group of people who have struggled in the past few months have been healthcare workers. What should the government be doing to better support healthcare workers?GOV. HOGAN: Well, it's really important. First of all, my very sincere appreciation goes out to those frontline healthcare workers. I've gotten a chance to thank some of them personally, and I want to thank any of them that are listening on here today, for the incredible sacrifices that they made. They really are the heroes of this entire pandemic, and have working under incredibly trying circumstances, not only sometimes without the protective equipment that they need, working around the clock with--under very trying circumstances with overloaded hospital systems and overflowing ICU units and sometimes without the proper equipment. They're also dealing and worrying about how to keep themselves safe and their families safe. You know, I think we've got to do everything we can to protect them.One thing that we're really concerned about, that these states just like many of the small businesses and the economy has taken a tank--is being tanked, the states are having tremendous shortfalls, perhaps as much as 30 percent loss in revenues. We're pushing the federal government to try to make sure that we get some assistance to state and local governments. We don't want to be--we've already lost 1.6 million state and local government workers. These are frontline, you know, workers that are needed more than ever, like people in the healthcare system, like our teachers, like firefighters and police officers and people that are out there providing services at unemployment offices and helping people in need. And so, we need that federal stimulus package. We need the fourth stimulus bill, and that's what we're pushing hard to do.MS. SELLERS: So, you have a state, as you mentioned, with some of the most important hospitals in the country, University of Maryland, where you were treated, and Hopkins. What more can be done to bring together the needs of the general public--the public health needs and the services provided by those hospitals?GOV. HOGAN: You know, one of the things is just making sure that we have--everybody has access to the health care. We've done a couple of interesting things. And during my term as governor here in Maryland, you know, we've had this issue of trying to--how do we make sure that we give health care coverage to as many people as we can and people that were left out of the system. So, I fought hard to protect and maintain and make sure we kept hundreds of thousands of people able to access their health care. But there was a problem in that health care costs were skyrocketing out of control and health insurance premiums were skyrocketing every year, putting health care coverage out of reach for a number of people. And we did a couple of innovative things here in our state, working together with our legislature in a bipartisan way where we did a reinsurance program for higher-risk things, where the state invested some money. But we were able to lower health insurance premiums two years in a row. And I think after 10 years of going up--and provide, you know--providing coverage for more people, providing better access and lowering costs. And I think, really, we should be addressing these things at the federal level. And there's been a lot of debate back and forth, but we've got to get the administration and the leaders in Congress on both sides of the aisle to come up with a way to provide coverage, to provide the access, but do it in a way that's more affordable.MS. SELLERS: Are we talking about a version of Obamacare?GOV. HOGAN: Well, the problem--Obamacare did a great job on expanding access, but Obamacare did a terrible job on cost, which is why the cost drove up. And Republicans said we have to get rid of Obamacare without a plan to replace it. The Democrats said Obamacare is great without a plan for how to reduce the costs. We, as usual, took the approach of let's look at fixing the broken system. Let's not throw out the people that need the coverage, but let's lower those costs and so that people, you know, aren't making decisions about do I pay my health insurance premium or do I feed my kids or pay my bills.MS. SELLERS: I think I have time for one last question, which is one of the most important ones I think for working parents around the state. What's your plan for reopening schools in Maryland this coming year?GOV. HOGAN: It's one of the--we've dealt with so many important questions and challenging decisions throughout this crisis, but this is one of the most difficult. We are--our state superintendent of schools and our state school board is going to be making those decisions. They put together a plan about a month ago, very detailed and thoughtful plan that laid out some guidelines. They are now--and they've also taken into consideration the guidelines from the CDC. And they're getting input from all of our county schoolboards and local school systems so to make sure that we make the right decision. The--we want--everyone wants to get our kids back to school as soon as we can. But we also want to make sure that we only do it in the way that's the safest possible way to keep our kids and our teachers safe. And we're going to figure that out here in Maryland. We're going to come up with--we're going to listen to the public health experts, we're going to get all the stakeholders' input, and we're going to provide some flexibilities to our local jurisdictions and our local schoolboards to be involved in the process.MS. SELLERS: Great. It sounds, if I'm hearing the message from you, that you're putting the public health advice from the scientists first. Thank you very much.GOV. HOGAN: We've been doing that from the beginning.MS. SELLERS: Thank you very much for joining us.GOV. HOGAN: Thank you so much. I appreciate it.MS. SELLERS: Thank you very much. We really appreciated hearing from you on such a wide-ranging set of topics and appreciate your taking the time, and congratulations on being five years out from your cancer diagnosis in 2015.GOV. HOGAN: Thank you.MS. SELLERS: I'm going to be back in a few minutes with actor Patrick Dempsey to talk about his foundation of the Dempsey Center in Lewiston, Maine, and the executive director of that center, Wendy Tardif. Thank you.[Video plays]MS. SELLERS: Welcome back. If you're just joining us, I'm Frances Stead Sellers, a senior writer at The Washington Post, and this is our second installment of Chasing Cancer 2020.I'm now delighted to welcome Patrick Dempsey, one of Hollywood's leading men, and the founder, also, of the Dempsey Center, in Lewiston, Maine, which is a cancer treatment center.And along with Patrick Dempsey will be the Executive Director of that Center, Wendy Tardif.Welcome to you, both.MR. DEMPSEY: Thank you very much for having us.MS. SELLERS: We're delighted to have you.My first question is for you, Patrick. You have a personal reason for founding this center in Maine, and could you tell us a little about that and how you came to make the decision to not only cure people as you do on television, in Grey's Anatomy; but also, with our philanthropy at this center in Lewiston, Maine.MR. DEMPSEY: Right. My mother was diagnosed in 1997 with ovarian cancer. Over the next 14 years, she had 12 reoccurrences. So, our family was profoundly impacted by that diagnosis. My mother was incredibly brave, very strong, a big fighter. And through her cancer journey, right around this time, I got involved with the Amgen Tour of California and the Breakaway from Cancer initiative. And at this point, that was where the inspiration for the cancer foundation came from, was working with Amgen, the Tour of California, and the Breakaway from Cancer initiative.Integrated medicine really hit me as something that has to go hand-in-hand with someone who's diagnosed with cancer; it's the way to go. And we began the program over 14 years ago, now.MS. SELLERS: So, we heard--we just heard Governor Hogan talk about being a cancer patient himself and the difficulty of talking to his family about that diagnosis.You were a son. What was it like from your perspective, understanding what your mother was going through, and what to expect?MR. DEMPSEY: It's very hard to understand what it is that you can do as a caregiver. And thank God, my sister, Mary, worked in the hospital, Central Maine Medical Center. So, she was there and could understand what the doctors were telling my mother. So, she could interpret what was going on. So, thank God for that, that we had a patient advocate that was there that happened to be my sister and my--you know, so, we had some inside knowledge and it really helped us tremendously. So, she could help us.And then, it was what we can do to really keep my mother's spirit up. What is it that she likes to do, and she didn't want to lay down. She had to stay active, so gardening, things like that. So, how do we keep people positive. How do we stay engaged and give them something to think about outside the treatments, and where to place the anxieties and all those questions, mentally? How do you channel that energy, and that's where sort of how this Center evolved, is how do we make life better for people? What are the questions that they're going to ask us, and how do we give those answers back that will, hopefully, give them some sort of comfort in this.MS. SELLERS: So, if you can describe just very briefly how that affects the programs you develop at the Center. And then, I'll turn to Wendy and ask her if she can describe to us how that she makes that vision come to life in the Center.MR. DEMPSEY: Right. A lot of our stuff is really high touch, right? So, how do we engage with someone emotionally and physically? And I think this is the real challenge with COVID right now, is because we have to have the social distancing. And in all of our centers, really about human contact, love, nurturing, the psychological, emotional development. So, we've had to transition now to be virtual. So, a lot of our programs are up and running, other than the acupuncture and the reiki.And to answer your question is we really ask our clients when they come in is what can we do to improve our services. And specifically, how do we customize the care for that individual? And I think this is really important, because the patient knows really what they need, and we need to listen and empower them, and give them the strength and dignity they deserve. And that's where we try to come from and meet them where they're at when they come in.And it's a very scary time when a person comes into the Center, because they really are admitting, you know, on a deep level, that they have cancer and that they need help, and we need to be there for them in a loving, nurturing, understanding way. And that's our goal, is how do we make life better and manageable, not only for the patient, but for the caregivers, for the children, and everyone around them. It's a remarkable experience and something I think is really needed.As soon as someone is diagnosed, I think this treatment should go in hand-in-hand, because you're looking at maybe one to two weeks before you get the information back. So, we could start with nutrition, with the mental attack on this, and getting the team organized on what the strategy will be moving forward. And I think this is something that we really want to do here at the Center, is have a good connection with other likeminded centers throughout the country so we can work together to have a standardized level of care moving forward.MS. SELLERS: Well, I'd love to hear from Wendy about how she makes these policies come to life in the Center in Lewiston.MS. TARDIF: Yeah, thank you, Frances. So, in terms of making them come to life, we have a really fantastic team at the Center, and we've really had a fantastic team right from the beginning. So, what I would say is that, you know, we really look at what are all those services that we can provide to cancer patients and their families, including caregivers and children, as Patrick just mentioned, and be able to envelope that family in services that are impactful to their life and complement the cancer treatments that they're receiving from their treatment team.And so, from that, we've really developed a program around, as Patrick mentioned, integrative medicine or complementary therapies, as we call them at the Center. We do massage therapy, acupuncture, reiki. We also have several licensed counselors on staff that provide one-on-one counseling, as well as group support.We have a family program called The Healing Tree, which, again, really envelopes the family as--you know, around that cancer patient. Usually, then, when a young person gets cancer that has young children, the first thing they think about is, \"Oh, my gosh. What about my children?\" And so, our program really helps parents to talk to their children about their disease and their treatments and help them to develop a plan for support for those kiddos. And then, we have a lot of programs around that, that really support the kids, something called Support for Seedlings, as well as a teen support group.And then, we also have a whole nutrition program where we show people how to cook in our demonstration kitchen and teach them how to cook healthfully. And then, they get to taste the food, go home, try some of things that they learn in the program, and then come back the next week, ask questions, and learn some more.And then, we have a whole fitness--fitness area where we do yoga classes, tai-chi, chi-gong, fit and flexible, trying to really help people gain--really gain more control over their lives and feel like they have--they're able to do more of the activities that they're interested in doing and improving areas of their life that really make life better for them.And during this--MS. SELLERS: When--MS. TARDIF: Frances, go ahead.MS. SELLERS: When I listen to you describe these complementary issues, it brings to--it feels heartbreaking to think about all these things you can't possibly do in this age of social distancing. Tell me just quickly how you've adapted, and then I have a question for Patrick. How can you possibly do all these things without being able to touch people?MS. TARDIF: Yeah, the touch piece is hard. But what I would say is that we have transitioned everything to virtual. So, we're doing one-on-one counseling virtually. So, our counselors are actually connecting with people one-on-one. We don't have the touch, but at least people have a way to get the therapy that they're looking for, depending on where they're at in their journey.We've transitioned our exercise classes to be virtual. Even our cooking classes we're doing virtually. And we have a lot more planned towards the future.The other thing I would say, too, is that, like, our massage therapy and our acupuncture, what we've done is we've transitioned those services to actually be classes now so that people can learn more about how they can do, like, acupressure, for instance, or self-massage or couples massage to help people with some of the sort of debilitating aspects of cancer treatments.MS. SELLERS: Patrick, you have been able to provide these extraordinary services free of charge, which is enormously important when people are facing often very high bills from their treatment. How will this continue during these tough economic times? Are there pressures on that?MR. DEMPSEY: Oh, there's absolutely pressures on that and we've done a good job managing our money. We have had to have--had to make some tough decisions and lay some people off.But we've kept our programs up and running. We've made the transition. I think the staff has done a fantastic job under Wendy's leadership, and the board, as well. I want to thank them for making the transition to virtual and to be able to connect people virtually very quickly.We have work to do. We are usually doing our bike event in the fall that helps us run--you know, really generate a lot of income. This year, we're doing it virtually for the first time, we switched. So, this is a new experience for us. So, we are going to be challenged this year in the challenge to raise enough money.Thank goodness we've been working with Omaze, which has been an amazing organization, where we're giving away an all-electric Porsche car, and the proceeds help us keep our doors open. So, get involved in that program. That can help us. And then, also, register for the Dempsey Challenge that's coming up very soon and help us in that way so that we can continue to provide these services at no cost to the patient. I think this is key. I mean, when people come in and they hear that news that we're there for them. We truly care and love and want them to feel good and we're not going to charge you.And we are able to do that because of the community and the people in our businesses, not only locally but nationally that have supported this cause, and we can't thank them enough and we're asking them this year to be incredibly generous. And there's a lot of people asking, there's a lot of need in the world. And I think the biggest need from all of us, and what we can give each other, is love, understanding, and patience right now, because the fear is going to overtake us if we're not careful. And people will act irrationally, and this is when we need to be loving and patient and not fall into the fear, which is going to be challenging for all of us. And the financial fears are there and they're real--MS. SELLERS: Right.MR. DEMPSEY: --and we want to sort of relieve that. Sorry, go ahead.MS. SELLERS: Well, you have developed an extraordinary model here in Lewiston, Maine. Do you see other cancers [sic] turning to you, asking your advice about how to set up similar programs around the country, or do you feel pretty much unique?MR. DEMPSEY: No, we want to be connected to other likeminded centers.And also, Wendy, will you also talk about what are the other--within the State of Maine, there are other likeminded centers, and we've worked very hard at being able to work together. Wendy, could you explain what we're trying to do, there?MS. TARDIF: Sure. So, we've set up an organization called the Association of Maine Cancer Support Centers. And I don't--when I say, \"we,\" I don't mean Dempsey Center, personally, but we're part of this group and we're trying to work collaboratively, together, to provide our services to everyone throughout Maine. And we're hoping that we can then take that model and really transition it into a national-level model. And one of the things with that is that all of the cancer resource centers that we have do the same thing we do, which is we don't charge people for the services. And one of the big reasons for that, Frances, is that it really empowers people that come through any of our doors to be able to make decisions on the services that they want to use based strictly on what's best for them. It's not about what they can afford; it's not about what their health care covers; it's all about what do they see as the most need for themselves and their families.MS. SELLERS: Patrick, you visit the Center regularly, I know, and you're obviously very personally invested in it. We are, as you just mentioned, at this moment of extreme fear and divisiveness and distrust.What is the Center meaning for you personally, and how do feel you can help imbue the sentiments of love that you mentioned in a place and keep the spirit going?MR. DEMPSEY: Yeah, I think it's really not falling into the fear, right? I think there's so much unknown in the world, the lack of leadership where we can trust what's being said to us. We have to double-check everything, unfortunately. And I think, you know, that is an emotional cancer. That is a cancer in our society we have to get rid of, and we have to be very holistic in our approach and collaborative in being able to overcome this disease.And I think that's what the Center represents within our community in many ways. It brings the community together and it centers it, and we need to be centered in our society right now. We're not. We're too on the extremes. We need to find our center and I hope that's what we can provide the patients who come in, who are facing something that is absolutely overwhelming, and now to have COVID on top of it, and the isolation when we need to be together is something that's going to be quite challenging moving into the fall.MS. SELLERS: Indeed, when we could see a second wave or more extreme--or a continuation, I guess, of this wave.What do you think your mother would have made of the Center? Was she aware of it before she died, I believe, in 2014?MR. DEMPSEY: She loved going there. She volunteered. She really enjoyed it. It was very therapeutic, and I think this is a good point that you brought up.And I think in survivorship for her--and she had such a long battle that there was a lot of guilt in the survivorship and it made her feel really good about herself to go back in and to be with other newly diagnosed patients. And the mentoring program that we have at the Center I think is really good that way.So, I think she would be--she would be sewing masks. She would be yelling at people to put their masks on. She was a strong woman and I think she would be in there working very hard, and certainly out in the garden right now this time of year in Maine.MS. SELLERS: You--right. You raised an interesting point about survivorship. We heard Governor Hogan talk about beating cancer, and a lot of people have talked about beating cancer. There's a whole new dialogue about living with cancer, which your mother did for so many years.Maybe Wendy can respond to this, about the sort of use of--or the treatment of cancer as a chronic disease or a long-term disease as opposed to one that one fights through a series of battles in a hospital.MS. TARDIF: Yeah, because it is--it really is a chronic disease, as you say, Frances. And in terms of, you know, kind of working through that, it's really important that centers like ours are offering people services and programs that they can utilize throughout survivorship.And when you think about, like, lifestyle changes, things around exercise and diet and the mindfulness, the things that we know can help with preventing chronic disease or reducing the intensity of a chronic disease. And so, those are a lot of things that we really focus on at the Center, as well, in terms of helping people through survivorship.And it's--you know, honestly, people are living longer now with cancer. So, we see--what we're seeing now is kind of the latent effects. So, if someone's diagnosed as a young adult and they're, you know, moving into their 50s and 60s, they're seeing some health effects that were caused by their cancer from many years ago. And so, you know, being able to help people through some of those situations, as well, is really important to us.MS. SELLERS: And I guess, getting away from the use of language as a battle that you might win or lose instead of one where you live with a disease that might be with you for a long time.MS. TARDIF: Absolutely. Yeah, that's absolutely right. And you know, the fact that--you know, when people are surviving cancer and they're--they haven't had a recurrence of it or anything like that but ending up with symptoms that were caused by the treatments themselves, it is really important that we're there for people and really helping them to move through some of that and finding ways to make their life better in those ways.MS. SELLERS: Wendy, a quick question for you, and then I'll come back to Patrick. But you have the Dempsey Center Challenge coming up. I believe you've raised $1 million--is that right?--in the past years. What's the plan for this year, and how are you going about it?MS. TARDIF: Yeah, that's a great question. Thank you for asking for that, actually. We have a pretty ambitious goal. Our sponsor is Amgen Oncology. This is the 12th year, actually, that Amgen has sponsored our event. People have the opportunity to run, walk, and cycle, generally, when we're in person.This year, people have even more opportunities to get out and be active, but our goal is to get people moving. Our goal is one-and-a-half million miles of movement, and then $1.5 million raised. So, that's what we're looking to do through the month of September.We have some different events leading up to that. We're using two platforms, Strava and Zwift, to do much of our activity tracking, if you will, with a lot of really exciting things that go along with that. And people can find out more if they log onto our website at DempseyChallenge.org.MS. SELLERS: So, Patrick, you have said you have a few new projects in the works. Can you tell us a little bit more about them and where they fit in your philanthropic work?MR. DEMPSEY: Yeah, I have a show that's going to be on--it's a financial thriller that will be premiering this fall on the CW, and that's exciting.And then, I was about to start a project called Ways & Means, a show set in D.C., but unfortunately that's on hold until we get a better understanding what's happening with the COVID virus. So, like everyone else, I'm waiting to see what happens and just trying to stay at home, and when I do go out, I wear my mask and I try to respect people around me. So, that--we'll see.MS. SELLERS: So, you're feeling the impact in your working life, as well, of this coronavirus, that you cannot shoot in the way you were able to in the past.MR. DEMPSEY: Right. I think you're seeing a lot of people now in development mode, writing to shoot. They're starting to shoot in Europe, now. They're starting to test that process and there's some production happening here, but it's going to be a long time before we're back up to speed. And most people are looking at end of this year and maybe 2021, spring, before we get back into real production.MS. SELLERS: So, one last question for you. Given your druthers, a year from now, what would you like to see at the Dempsey Center? What's the next stage? What's your biggest ambition for the place?MR. DEMPSEY: Well, you know, our goal is to reach everyone who has been diagnosed with cancer in the State of Maine, and if we could achieve that and be able to give them the care and the attention that they deserve, then I think that is a goal that's possible. It's basically having the awareness and the opportunity and the means to support people.I hope we have our doors someone and when we greet someone, we can go up to them and hug them and hold them, and say, \"Welcome.\"MS.

The Upshot\u2019s Nate Cohn notes that Biden\u2019s lead is larger than any presidential race has seen in the last quarter-century. The Economist projects a 93 percent chance Trump loses the electoral college and a 99 percent chance he loses the popular vote.

Sure, it\u2019s possible! But with each day the coronavirus pandemic persists and Trump flails, the probability of a turnaround seems less likely. The likelihood that Trump will bring down other Republicans running for office must also be considered.Let\u2019s assume this outcome for a second \u2014 what does it mean for the GOP? Politics is a coldblooded game, and even before Trump has been declared a political dead man walking, speculation is beginning about what comes after. Commentary\u2019s Noah Rothman recently observed, \u201cThe post-Trump era could begin sooner than many expect, and it would serve Republicans to prepare accordingly.\u201d ADADSome are preparing by jumping ship. The AP\u2019s Steve Peoples reports that former Ohio GOP governor John Kasich will speak in support of Biden at the Democratic National Convention: \u201cKasich is among a handful of high-profile Republicans likely to become more active in supporting Biden in the fall.\u201d Similarly, the Republicans who have joined the #NeverTrump movement seem willing to burn their party ID cards. In an interview with my Post colleague Greg Sargent, Lincoln Project co-founder John Weaver confirmed that, \u201cThe group is preparing to vehemently oppose efforts by GOP senators to obstruct and stymie Biden\u2019s agenda, should he win the presidency.\u201d Read the whole thing to understand Weaver\u2019s reasoning, but I think it\u2019s safe to say that any group that put out this ad is not worried about mollifying the Trumpists within the GOP:If Trump\u2019s apostates have left the party for good, what does that mean for a post-Trump GOP? Rothman suggests that if Trump gets pasted in November, the party will inevitably spurn him as well: \u201cThere will be a reckoning with the conditions that led the GOP to sacrifice most of the gains they made during eight years of Barack Obama.... if history is any guide, one-term presidents do not escape their party\u2019s censure no matter the conditions that led to their defenestration from the Oval Office.\u201d ADADThis is one possibility, and would frankly be the most encouraging one. It is true that after George H.W. Bush lost, the GOP became the party it is today, one largely dedicated to not compromising. A Trump loss \u2014 particularly if the loss is so large that he takes down the Senate majority as well \u2014 could lead to serious self-reflection.There are reasons to be doubtful, however. Even if Trump crashes and burns, his cult of personality will command significant loyalty from his #MAGA base. That alone is enough to influence party primaries that in turn influence the party\u2019s future leaders.Furthermore, the degree to which Trumpists have permeated the entire GOP infrastructure has been underestimated. On Monday the Texas GOP, the country\u2019s largest state Republican Party, elected former Florida congressman and current bigot Allen West to be its party chair. According to the Texas Tribune\u2019s Patrick Sviteck, \u201cWest rallied delegates against what he said was the \u2018tyranny that we see in the great state of Texas, where we have executive orders and mandates, people telling us what we can and cannot do, who is essential, who is not essential.\u2019 \u201d The Texas GOP is hardly the only right-leaning institution that has prostrated itself before Trumpist ideals to retain its relevancy.ADADPerhaps this infrastructure pivots in a post-Trump world. That would require, however, concerted action from activists and donors. Their fecklessness over the past four years is hardly reassuring on that front.Bloomberg News\u2019s Tyler Cowen offers some thoughts about what the post-Trump GOP would look like: \u201cIn the coming years, three things will dominate the attention of the intellectual right: the main international rival (China), the main domestic rival (the left), and the main thing they stare at all day long (the Internet).\u201d Cowen thinks this looks different from Trump, but it sounds awfully Trumpy to me.The scary thing about a post-Trump GOP is the prospect that it learns nothing. After getting pasted in 2006 and 2008, the GOP adopted an obstructionist posture during the Obama years. The more disaffected voters were during the Great Recession, the better this strategy worked. It is all too conceivable that the post-Trump GOP changes itself not at all. It can count on the vagaries of partisan politics in the United States to eventually inherit political power once again.", "comment": "51 Comments", "topic": "PostEverything"}, {"cover": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/NTSL3ND4BREV5O6VMAMDFYEFO4.jpghttps://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/NTSL3ND4BREV5O6VMAMDFYEFO4.jpg", "title": "From cow to customer, a $20 cheeseburger\u2019s tumultuous journey during a pandemic", "date": "Jul 7, 2020", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2020/07/07/le-diplomate-burger-beef-supply-chain-coronavirus/", "keyword": "China and the world order", "website": "the Washington Post", "author": "", "content": "", "comment": "", "topic": ""}, {"cover": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/XSCPJJF72MI6VH65W6WGWBI5ZA.jpghttps://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/XSCPJJF72MI6VH65W6WGWBI5ZA.jpg", "title": "States mandate masks, begin to shut down again as coronavirus cases soar and hospitalizations rise", "date": "Jul 6, 2020", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/coronavirus-rises-states-shutdown/2020/07/06/d8805d18-bf9e-11ea-9fdd-b7ac6b051dc8_story.html", "keyword": "China and the world order", "website": "the Washington Post", "author": "Joshua PartlowNick Miroff", "content": "The pandemic map of the United States burned bright red Monday, with the number of new coronavirus infections during the first six days of July nearing 300,000 as more states and cities moved to reimpose shutdown orders.Support our journalism.

The United States is \u201cstill knee deep in the first wave\u201d of the pandemic, Anthony S. Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said Monday.Fauci noted that while Europe managed to drive infections down \u2014 and now is dealing with little blips as it reopens \u2014 U.S. communities \u201cnever came down to baseline and now are surging back up,\u201d he said in an interview conducted on Twitter and Facebook with his boss, National Institutes of Health Director Francis Collins.ADADDespite President Trump\u2019s claim that 99 percent of coronavirus cases are \u201charmless,\u201d Arizona and Nevada have reported their highest numbers of coronavirus-related hospitalizations in recent days. The seven-day averages in 12 states hit new highs, with the biggest increases in West Virginia, Tennessee and Montana. The country\u2019s rolling seven-day average of daily new cases hit a record high Monday \u2014 the 28th record-setting day in a row.In Arizona, 89 percent of the state\u2019s intensive care unit beds were full Monday morning, the state\u2019s Department of Health announced, as the recently hard-hit state surpassed 100,000 cases.In Miami-Dade County, authorities reversed course on a reopening plan, issuing an emergency order that shut down gyms, party venues and restaurants, with exceptions for takeout and delivery. That order will go into effect Wednesday. Florida has seen its caseload soar past 10,000 per day and 200,000 overall.\u201cWe want to ensure that our hospitals continue to have the staffing necessary to save lives,\u201d Miami-Dade Mayor Carlos Gimenez said in his announcement.ADADGimenez said the spike has been driven by infections among 18- to 34-year-olds who have been gathering in congested places \u2014 indoors and out \u2014 without wearing masks and maintaining proper distancing.\u201cContributing to the positives in that age group, the doctors have told me, were graduation parties, gatherings at restaurants that turned into packed parties in violation of the rules, and street protests where people could not maintain social distancing and where not everyone was wearing facial coverings,\u201d Gimenez said.Despite the steep new rise in infections, the House and Senate have adjourned for a two-week recess, setting up a potential battle when they return over another pandemic relief package.ADAnd more politicians continue to contract the virus. In Mississippi, where cases are rising, several lawmakers have tested positive, including the speaker of the State House of Representatives. Gov. Tate Reeves (R) wrote on Twitter he was \u201cbriefly in contact\u201d with one of them, so he plans to isolate himself until he gets his own test results back. Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms (D) tweeted Monday evening that \u201cCOVID-19 has literally hit home. I have had NO symptoms and have tested positive.\u201dThe United States has reported 2.9 million coronavirus cases to date, and at least 127,000 people have died of the virus nationwide. The United States has had more than twice as many reported deaths as any other country and accounts for nearly a quarter of all deaths attributed to the virus worldwide.ADSome states imposed fresh restrictions on Monday in an attempt to tamp down rising case numbers and preserve hospital capacity.ADWest Virginia Gov. Jim Justice (R) announced that face coverings will be mandatory inside buildings, and he asked residents to comply voluntarily. West Virginia hit an all-time peak of 130 new cases in one day on Sunday, putting its total at 3,442 cases on Monday.\u201cIf you go to work in a building, I expect you to wear a mask as you enter work, and if you\u2019re working in an area that is completely socially distanced, take your mask off,\u201d Justice said during a briefing. \u201cIf you go to a drinking fountain, put your mask on. If you go into a retail business, then I expect you to wear a mask.\u201dLocal ABC affiliate WCHS reported that Justice added that he had put off mandating masks but eventually decided \u201cit is the very thing I want to do the most because I know in my heart if we don\u2019t, we are going to have funeral after funeral.\u201dUniversities, quickly approaching their fall semesters, also were grappling with how to provide an education without risking student health.ADADHarvard University announced Monday it will reopen with fewer than half of its undergraduates on campus, a sign of the extraordinary constraints colleges face across the country as they map out plans for the fall term. No more than 40 percent of Harvard\u2019s undergrads will live at the Ivy League campus in Cambridge, Mass., when the school year begins, the university said. Most of them will be first-year students, who will get priority access to help them adjust to college life. All undergraduate courses will be taught remotely, the university said, no matter where the students are living. Tuition will remain the same.Public health officials have been pleading with younger people to take the virus more seriously, as new cases among that demographic have driven spikes in several places. Fauci on Monday called on young people to realize that they are not \u201cinvulnerable to serious consequences\u201d of the virus. Even though they may not get sick enough to end up in the hospital, they still could get \u201cvery sick\u201d for weeks, he said. And by getting infected, he added, \u201cthey are propagating the outbreak\u201d and might inadvertently infect someone vulnerable, with potentially fatal outcomes.Though largely considered less vulnerable, young children have shown susceptibility as people try to return to their normal routines. The Texas Department of Health and Human Services reported Monday that at least 1,335 people have tested positive at child-care facilities, and about a third of the cases were children.ADADTrump and his campaign have increasingly argued that Americans need to continue to live their lives despite the pandemic. On Monday afternoon, Trump tweeted, in all caps, \u201cSCHOOLS MUST OPEN IN THE FALL!!!\u201dTrump has played down the rise in cases, attributing it to expanded testing, and has recently emphasized that U.S. deaths have not spiked with new cases. He tweeted on Monday: \u201cThe Mortality Rate for the China Virus in the U.S. is just about the LOWEST IN THE WORLD!\u201dOther Republicans have struck a more serious tone. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) on Monday said: \u201cThis is not over.\u201d\u201cWe had hoped we\u2019d be on the way to saying goodbye to this health-care pandemic. Clearly it is not over,\u201d McConnell said at a news conference at a Louisville food bank. Public health officials in both parties have criticized the Trump administration for dismissing science and expertise in its handling of the pandemic. Dozens of former government scientists on Monday called for a science-based approach.\u201cSidelining science has already cost lives, imperiled the safety of our loved ones, compromised our ability to safely reopen our businesses, schools, and places of worship, and endangered the health of our democracy itself,\u201d wrote officials from the Trump, Obama and George W. Bush administrations.Another group of more than 200 scientists from dozens of countries urged the World Health Organization to take more seriously the possibility of airborne-transmission of the virus, saying there is growing evidence that it can linger in the air indoors in small aerosol particles. More than 11.5 million cases have been reported worldwide.ADADAlso on Monday, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted an emergency use authorization for a rapid, point-of-care covid-19 diagnostic test that can yield results within 15 minutes, medical technology company Becton Dickinson announced.The new antigen test, which detects the presence of the virus,  will be used in conjunction with another diagnostic tool from the company that is in use in more than 25,000 hospitals, medical centers and retail pharmacies across the country.Dave Hickey, president of Integrated Diagnostic Solutions for Becton Dickinson, said in a statement that the test will be a \u201cgame changer\u201d for health-care workers and patients.ADIn May, the FDA issued an emergency approval for the first coronavirus antigen test that was made by Quidel Corp.Fauci and Collins ended their 30 minute session on Monday with something of a pep talk.AD\u201cWe will get through this,\u201d Fauci said. \u201cWe have already suffered through a lot of pain, a lot of economic and personal pain and inconvenience.\u201d He said \u201cscience will get us through this\u201d by delivering drugs for early- and late-stage covid-19.\u201cHang in there, it will end,\u201d he said. \u201cWe promise you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nLaurie McGinley, Felicia Sonmez, Hannah Denham, Lateshia Beachum, Nick Anderson and Yasmeen Abutaleb contributed to this report.", "comment": "5.9k Comments", "topic": "National"}, {"cover": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/MFX3JZWFHQI6VKBFQ4RAATSBKA.jpghttps://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/MFX3JZWFHQI6VKBFQ4RAATSBKA.jpg", "title": "Mask-wearing, embraced by economists as key to the recovery, proves politically tricky for the Fed", "date": "Jul 17, 2020", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/07/17/fed-masks-economy/", "keyword": "China and the world order", "website": "the Washington Post", "author": "Rachel Siegel", "content": "A top Federal Reserve official is calling on Americans to wear masks, saying the practice can have crucial benefits for the future of the economic recovery, even as masks fan political flames normally avoided by the central bank at all costs.Support our journalism. Subscribe today.arrow-right\u201cWe\u2019re confident that masks work, and if you want to reopen the economy faster, you want to get people back on planes and in stores,\u201d Robert Kaplan, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, said in an interview with The Washington Post. \u201cPart of my job, I believe, is to call it out.\u201dKaplan\u2019s comments are more forward-leaning than those of his central bank colleagues and come as masks have emerged as a hot-button political issue ranging from state to state \u2014 or in some cases, city to city \u2014 about how to stop the spread of the novel coronavirus pandemic.ADADThe White House\u2019s message on mask-wearing has been inconsistent, and there is no firm federal policy on it. That confusion has left businesses large and small to take matters into their own hands and mandate their own policies.Kaplan\u2019s mask-wearing call is significant, because Fed officials tend to avoid political or controversial issues that aren\u2019t immediately tied to employment, interest rates or financial markets. Yet his emphasis on masks further reveals how, for some members within the central bank, public health tools for controlling the pandemic are viewed in tandem with safeguarding the economy. Other Fed leaders, including Chair Jerome H. Powell, have said more generally that the virus will dictate the pace of the recovery.Still, few have stepped forward to advocate mask-wearing so pointedly, for fear of inflaming political tensions, even as early signs of the recovery appear to be fizzling.ADAD\u201cUnless we get the virus under control, we see that growth is slowing and the rebound is less pronounced,\u201d Kaplan told The Post.A growing number of academic and private-sector economists echo the idea that more people wearing masks will help fuel the recovery. Goldman Sachs economists concluded that a national mask mandate could save the economy from a 5 percent loss in gross domestic product and offset fears that persistent shutdowns would be drags on economic activity.\u201cThe three most important policies for creating an economic recovery are public health, public health and public health,\u201d said Justin Wolfers, a professor of public policy and economics at the University of Michigan. \u201cAnd the fourth and fifth are monetary and fiscal policy.\u201dADMasks are among the most efficient ways of containing the virus, Wolfers said, and a low-cost alternative to closing schools and public spaces. He pointed to the basic economic concept of opportunity costs, which would show that the economic and health consequences of not wearing a mask are extremely high \u2014 and far more expensive than the cost of wearing them.AD\u201cThe Fed clearly has an interest here,\u201d Wolfers said, \u201cand that\u2019s because the Fed serves the American people, and the American people have an interest here.\u201dNot all Americans are sold on the public health or economic benefits of wearing masks. Deep into the pandemic, President Trump said wearing a mask should be voluntary, while raising doubts about whether face coverings limit the virus\u2019s spread. Especially in more conservative states, masks have been criticized as government overreach or an infringement on personal liberty. The sharp partisan divide is playing out within states, with conservative governors clashing with mayors in left-leaning cities over mask requirements.After the fastest recession in U.S. history, the economic recovery may be fizzlingThis week, the governors of Alabama, Montana, Arkansas and Colorado issued statewide mask orders, meaning about half of all states now have a mandate in place. Meanwhile, Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp (R) signed an executive order on Wednesday banning cities from adopting their own mandates.ADADMasks may be among \u201cthe cheapest forms of stimulus ever designed by humans,\u201d said Austan Goolsbee, former chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers and a professor at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business. But widespread mask usage would also make it easier for the Fed\u2019s unprecedented emergency response to take root. Goolsbee recently co-wrote research on how peoples\u2019 basic fear of catching the virus is an ominous sign for the recovery.\u201cThere\u2019s a fence around the effectiveness of monetary policy,\u201d Goolsbee said. \u201cFor the policy to be effective, people have to buy into it.\u201dThe reason mask-wearing can heal the economy is twofold, economists say: Public health officials say they contain the virus\u2019s spread and that masks are necessary to give people the confidence to safely go back to work, their favorite restaurant or the neighborhood mall. Strong consumer confidence fuels consumer spending, which typically drives about 70 percent of the U.S. economy.ADADThere\u2019s also evidence that other countries with strong mask mandates are seeing a turnaround. For example, China\u2019s second-quarter GDP grew by 3.2 percent compared with a year ago, marking a rebound from earlier in the year when the pandemic tore through its economy.When it comes to calling on Americans to wear masks, no other Fed leader has been as blunt as Kaplan. That includes Powell, who has declined to weigh in with specific advice for public health experts or lawmakers debating additional government support.Instead, Powell talks about the recovery as dependent on the country\u2019s ability to contain the virus. In congressional hearings and public appearances, Powell insists that the cloud of uncertainty hanging over the economy is inextricably linked with the pandemic. He has also said that \u201ca full recovery is unlikely until people are confident that it is safe to reengage in a broad range of activities.\u201dWhite House signals openness to unemployment compromise as crucial deadline looms for 30 million Americans\u201cAs the lockdown ends and the economy reopens, the first thing is that, you know, we need to do it in a sustainable way,\u201d Powell said in a June 17 hearing before the House Financial Services Committee. \u201cKeep a distance, wash your hands, you know, wear a mask, that kind of thing. That\u2019s really going to help. That goes with faster reopening of the economy. That goes with a successful reopening.\u201dADADRegional Fed chiefs and Fed board members have talked about mask-wearing, along with extensive coronavirus testing, as necessary to contain the virus and get the economy back on track. This week, St. Louis Fed President James Bullard spoke on how \u201csimple risk mitigation strategies, including ubiquitous masks, hold the promise of delivering higher household incomes along with lower fatalities from covid-19.\u201d\u201cThe more we can practice our great mitigation strategies \u2014 wearing masks, social distancing \u2014 you know, the more likely we are to be able to sustain our economic activity,\u201d said San Francisco Federal Reserve President Mary C. Daly during a Washington Post Live interview earlier this month.ADAnd in mid-June, Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester said that \u201cbetter adherence to the guidelines on social distancing, mask wearing, and hygiene would help to control the virus\u2019s spread.\u201dADFed leaders have led by example and worn masks in public, too. Powell wore one when he testified before the House Financial Services Committee on June 30. But beyond Kaplan, Fed leaders have not gone so far as to call on Americans to wear masks for the sake of the economy.There are plenty of reasons for Powell to be cautious in his public statements. No recession in the modern era has been so entrenched within a public health crisis, and the Fed prefers to leave mask advocacy to epidemiologists and public health experts.ADPlus, the Fed wants to preserve and protect its role as the government\u2019s top economic authority by avoiding the political fray and not telling other parts of government how to do their jobs. Masks, in particular, have become  a partisan flash point within the country\u2019s response to the pandemic and the economic fallout.ADAs a surge in cases forced states such as Florida, California, Texas and Arizona to roll back their reopening plans, masks gained traction beyond the large coastal cities where they have been commonplace for months. Walmart, the world\u2019s biggest retailer, announced Wednesday that it will require  masks in all stores, joining a list that now includes Target, CVS, Costco, Best Buy and Apple. The National Retail Federation also called upon all retailers this week to require customers to cover their faces.The chaotic debate extends up to the White House, where Trump long refused to encourage Americans to wear masks and changed his tune only this week, telling CBS News that: \u201cIf it\u2018s necessary, I would urge [Americans] to wear a mask.\u201dAdministration officials insist the economy is back on track. White House forecasts for a rebound  this year are often at odds with more measured expectations from the Fed.As the Fed doubles down on its crisis response, Powell is not looking to raise tensions with the White House. Before the pandemic, Trump routinely attacked Powell for not doing enough to juice the economy. More recently, the president has dubbed the Fed chair his \u201cmost improved player.\u201d\u201cAs this continues, the American people will use what they have learned about covid-19 and take the appropriate precautions, such as social distancing, facial coverings, and good hygiene, to protect the public health and return us to a growing economy,\u201d said White House spokesman Judd Deere.That leaves Powell and the Fed in a fraught position, even if masks are increasingly viewed as key to ushering in a stronger economic recovery.Fed officials raised concerns in June that U.S. could enter a much worse recession if coronavirus cases continued to surge\u201cAt the time of peak \u2018Trump v. Powell,\u2019 people asked, \u2018does this threaten the Fed\u2019s independence?\u2019 \u201d Goolsbee said. \u201cThe biggest problem with this is that when there comes a crisis, which hopefully there won\u2019t be, the Fed\u2019s credibility is tremendously important.\u201dScott Sumner, an expert on monetary policy at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University, said the Fed is skilled at talking around issues that don\u2019t fall squarely within its lane. Fed leaders wouldn\u2019t \u201cgo on a crusade for mask-wearing,\u201d Sumner said. But if there\u2019s agreement that the pandemic is driving the recession, \u201cit\u2019s hard [for the Fed] to refrain from at least indirectly speaking out on that.\u201d\u201cThere is the perception that policy is very dysfunctional right now, there\u2019s mixed messages coming out about whether people should wear masks, whether there\u2019s enough testing,\u201d Sumner said. \u201cAnd that does spill over into the economy, which is the Fed\u2019s territory.\u201dKaplan agrees. He pointed to data from the Dallas Fed\u2019s Mobility and Engagement Index, which tracks the pandemic\u2019s impact on behavior through mobile data showing how much time people spend at home, how far they go when they leave the house, and so on. The index plummeted in mid-March as the country stayed home to avoid becoming infected, then began improving in late April.More mobility means more economic activity \u2014 but it also means a higher risk of spreading the virus. Kaplan said he is convinced that masks could help keep people engaged in the economy without spurring such spikes in case counts.That\u2019s a message he says falls directly under his job description.\u201cI think it\u2019s very critical, in the middle of a pandemic, that we are seen as apolitical,\u201d Kaplan said. \u201cBut on the other hand, we\u2019re willing to call out what we\u2019re seeing. \u2026 That also means I\u2019ve got to be willing to call out drivers that may not have a lot to do with monetary policy.\u201dHeather Long contributed to this report.", "comment": "91 Comments", "topic": "Economy"}, {"cover": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/OS7W6FGHTEI6VKBFQ4RAATSBKA.jpghttps://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/OS7W6FGHTEI6VKBFQ4RAATSBKA.jpg", "title": "Here\u2019s what Kayleigh McEnany would like to talk about", "date": "Jul 17, 2020", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/07/17/heres-what-kayleigh-mcenany-would-like-talk-about/", "keyword": "China and the world order", "website": "the Washington Post", "author": "Philip Bump", "content": "This article has been updated.White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany\u2019s news briefings take a particular form. An introductory presentation of President Trump\u2019s successes or concerns. A spate of questions parried like Luke Skywalker deflecting blaster fire. Then an abrupt ending, often with a few prepared slides and talking points before she strides out the door.Support our journalism. Subscribe today.arrow-rightIt\u2019s that middle part where McEnany\u2019s extended stint as a cable-news pundit before joining the Trump administration is most obvious. In that job, she would sit down at a table in a television studio to fulfill her role as designated Donald Trump supporter, an iPad in front of her containing the points she intended to make on the appointed subject. She now approaches questions from the reporters as she would challenges from a fellow panelist, as necessarily aggressive and as an opportunity to score points rather to inform. And in service of those picayune scraps, she comes prepared not with an iPad but a thick binder of talking points she\u2019s prepared to offer on any given subject \u2014 regardless of whether those points actually address the reporter\u2019s question.ADADConsider an interaction from a news briefing on Thursday. McEnany was asked how Trump felt about the indictment of a Republican member of Congress on charges related to fraudulent voting, the sort of thing that would occupy a disproportionate amount of Trump\u2019s attention were it a Democrat. Instead of simply saying that she wasn\u2019t aware of Trump\u2019s position on the matter, which is fair enough even if it\u2019s a deflection in its own right, McEnany instead flipped through her binder. She might not have any comments about that incident, but she had a lot to say about fraud in general, listing a series of incidents aimed at presenting a hazy sense of risk about the process of voting by mail. (It was not terribly effective.)Reuters photographer Jonathan Ernst managed to snap a photo of the binder as McEnany was flipping through it, capturing an image of tabs indicating a number of different subjects that McEnany was prepared to address. Unlike when she was sitting on a set at CNN, where the network would give a heads-up about the topic being discussed, McEnany had to be prepared for anything. And so: more than 40 individual subjects, all labeled, all accessible with one precisely manicured finger flip.Here is each of the labeled tabs that were visible in Ernst\u2019s photo in order of appearance, and what each appears to mean. Some of these are our assumptions; if you have more insight, please email.ADADABSURD. The first tab is perhaps the vaguest. \u201cAbsurd\u201d is one of McEnany\u2019s favorite terms of art for questions from the press \u2014 \u201cWell, your first question is absolutely absurd,\u201d she said to a reporter on June 29, for example \u2014 but it\u2019s not entirely clear what might prompt her to flip to this particular page.BLM. Questions about the Black Lives Matter movement. In the past, for example, she has criticized the movement by quoting from an anti-police chant that was used at one rally five years ago.BALLOT. As a reporter asked McEnany about Rep. Steve Watkins (R-Kan.), the member of Congress who had been indicted, she listened to the question until the alleged voter fraud was mentioned. Then, as she began her answer, she flipped to the front of her binder and freestyled until she landed on her talking points.In this case, McEnany used her talking points to note that many mail ballots are rejected (a sign they are vetted for validity), that some ballots had been misprinted and that a mail truck containing ballots had caught fire.ADADThese, she said, were signs there was \u201crampant voter fraud\u201d with mail-in voting \u2014 which, again, wasn\u2019t the question. And which they aren\u2019t.CASES. Presumably data on the number of new cases recorded in the coronavirus pandemic. This didn\u2019t come up on Thursday.CDC. An employee of the aggressively pro-Trump One America News asked a question about the reliability of data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, giving McEnany an opportunity to flip to the CDC tab and articulate the surveillance mechanisms the government uses to track the spread of the pandemic.CHINA. Obviously myriad possibilities for the contents of this tab. McEnany did flip to it in response to a question, but simply stated that the White House had no announcements to make about potential bans on travel by the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party.ADADCOVID. During a briefing earlier this month, a reporter asked about the increase in hospitalizations as new coronavirus cases surged.\u201cI\u2019m glad that you asked about covid,\u201d McEnany replied, referring to covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, \u201cbecause I do want to take a moment to highlight some of the things that the federal government has done.\u201dWhich is how this whole process works.It\u2019s worth noting that, while there was an overarching \u201cCOVID\u201d tab on Thursday, there were also individual tabs focused on aspects of the response to the disease. That included the two tabs that followed \u201cCOVID,\u201d each identified with a superimposed red sticker.AD[M]ORTA. The visible part of the first sticker read \u201cORTA,\u201d almost certainly meaning that it focused on the MORTAlity rate of the virus.With new cases climbing several weeks before the number of covid-19 deaths did, the administration has of late focused on mortality rate \u2014 that is, the number of deaths relative to the number of cases. More cases and fewer deaths means a lower mortality rate, which means a better metric for the White House to use.ADAs deaths continue to rise, though, that metric will become less politically useful.TEST. Another red-sticker tab, referring to testing for the virus. McEnany flipped to it in response to a question about slow turnaround times for new tests. Her response, apparently read from the binder, focused on how much testing the United States has done relative to other countries and the number of test sites that had been established in \u201ccounties with moderate to high social vulnerability.\u201dADDEFUND. The administration has sought to to elevate calls for defunding police departments as an attack on Trump\u2019s political opponents, an effort for which McEnany was certainly prepared. So far, Americans broadly understand the slogan to mean a demand that police departments change how they operate, not generally that the departments be disbanded entirely.ADDACA. Talking points focused on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals policy implemented by Barack Obama. The policy allowed people who\u2019d come to the country illegally as children a way to live in the U.S. legally. Trump has opposed the policy and attempted to undercut it. Earlier this week, a court ordered the administration to accept new applications for the program, but it has refused to do so.EARLY. It\u2019s not clear what this refers to though it might be a reference to early voting.ADECON. Presumably for questions about the economy. The administration has repeatedly celebrated record monthly gains in new employment, records that occurred thanks to the sharp drop in employment that accompanied efforts to contain the virus.ELECTION. McEnany\u2019s standard response for political questions she doesn\u2019t want to answer (such as about Trump\u2019s sagging poll numbers) is to direct questioners to the campaign. It\u2019s not clear, then, what specifically this refers to.ADFAU[CI]. In recent days, tension between members of the administration and the government\u2019s leading infectious-disease expert, Anthony S. Fauci, has become public. Trump\u2019s top trade official, Peter Navarro, attacked Fauci\u2019s credibility in an op-ed published by USA Today, an attack that Trump had blessed, according to later reporting.ADFLYNN. For questions about Michael Flynn, Trump\u2019s first national security adviser who left the administration after only a few weeks. He was later indicted as part of Robert S. Mueller III\u2019s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. Despite his admission of guilt, the Justice Department sought to have the charges against him thrown out.GOLF. Trump\u2019s frequent golf-playing has conflicted with his pre-election criticisms of Barack Obama for his own golf habit. Over the weekend, Trump defended his frequent trips to the course as being a form of exercise and claimed that he has played less often than Obama did.ADHe has played far more often and almost always at properties that generate personal income for himself.GOYA. A White House visit by the chief executive of Goya Foods Inc. prompted backlash among Trump\u2019s critics. The company is heavily reliant on Hispanic American customers, and Hispanic Americans are heavily critical of Trump\u2019s presidency. The backlash spurred a counterbacklash, which included Trump himself posing at the venerable Resolute Desk in the Oval Office, giving a thumbs up to several Goya products.HATCH. That promotion and Trump\u2019s campaign-rally-style remarks from the Rose Garden earlier this week raised questions about the Hatch Act, a law that prohibits using government resources for campaigning.\u201cCan you talk about your understanding of what the White House policy is for this White House as far as politics?\u201d a reporter asked on Thursday, citing the Rose Garden comments.\u201cWe act in accordance with the Hatch Act,\u201d McEnany replied. \u201cIt\u2019s well established that the president and vice president are not subject to the Hatch Act.\u201dAfter a bit more on the law, the reporter followed up.\u201cThat\u2019s not my question,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Hatch Act has nothing to do with this.\u201dPerhaps not, but that was something McEnany was prepared to talk about.HATE. A vague reference with no clear antecedent in the current news environment.HEALTH. Presumably for questions about Trump\u2019s personal health. There has been a swirl of questions about Trump in recent months, including about his risk from the coronavirus and blowback from his focus on the mental capacity of his likely general election opponent, former vice president Joe Biden.HOGAN. In an op-ed for The Post, Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan (R) criticized Trump\u2019s handling of the pandemic.McEnany was prepared for questions about him, flipping to the \u201cHOGAN\u201d tab and noting various occasions \u2014 March 19, April 18 \u2014 when Hogan had praised the federal response.KARL. Perhaps a reference to ABC News\u2019s Jonathan Karl, who, in another Post op-ed, criticized McEnany herself for the way in which she approached press briefings.\u201cThe White House press secretary\u2019s job differs fundamentally from that of a spokesperson for a candidate or political party,\u201d Karl wrote. \u201cThe White House press secretary serves at the pleasure of a president but is also a public servant whose salary is paid by taxpayers. The job is to inform the public: to be an intermediary between the president and a press corps the public relies on for information....\u201d\u201cDenying reality and using the White House podium for purely political purposes is a violation of public trust,\u201d he wrote.On Thursday, McEnany was prepared with talking points to rebut him, should the issue have come up.LGBT. An umbrella for questions about gay and transgender issues.Earlier this week, there was a question posed to McEnany about Trump\u2019s 2019 tweet banning transgender individuals from serving in the military.\u201cI haven\u2019t talked to him about that specific policy,\u201d McEnany replied \u2014 then pivoted to her talking points. \u201cBut this president is proud that, in 2019, we launched a global initiative to end the criminalization of homosexuality throughout the world.\u201d And so on.LIES. An evocative label for information being offered by a press secretary, to be sure.It\u2019s possible that this tab included talking points meant to rebut The Post\u2019s determination earlier this week that Trump had made at least 20,000 false or misleading statements as president. We don\u2019t call all of those statements lies, but it is certainly a succinct way of referring to the subject.MARY. Presumably Mary L. Trump, the president\u2019s niece whose new book about the family has become a bestseller.MASKS. Another coronavirus-related topic. Over the weekend, the president posed for cameras while wearing a face mask for the first time, which may be why the subject was included in McEnany\u2019s notes.Or, perhaps, it included talking points about CDC Director Robert Redfield\u2019s comment this week that we could shut down the spread of the virus in a month or two. The White House position has been not that Americans should wear masks but, instead, that they should follow the lead of local officials \u2014 a position that has at times proven awkward for administration officials.MEDIA. McEnany revels in using anecdotal examples of media outlets having to correct stories as a way to undercut trust in their broader reporting. She has repeatedly rattled off similar examples at past briefings, suggesting that this particular tab is well-worn.\u201cI really think that it\u2019s time for the New York Times to step back and ask themselves why they\u2019ve been wrong \u2014 so wrong, so often,\u201d she said on June 29, for example, then listing a number of things she asserted the newspaper had been incorrect about.MEULLER [sic]. Trump\u2019s decision to commute the sentence of his longtime adviser Roger Stone prompted the former special counsel to write an op-ed for The Post reinforcing Stone\u2019s guilt on the charges he faced. While the tab may have included broader talking points about the Mueller probe, it likely also focused on Mueller\u2019s essay.OBAMA. Another broad category. It may have included a point McEnany threw out at the end of the briefing on Thursday, accusing the Obama administration of prematurely halting testing during the H1N1 pandemic in 2009. That halt, though, came under vastly different circumstances during the spread of a vastly less dangerous virus. It also marked a transition to a different sort of data collection.PPE. Presumably data on the government\u2019s production of personal protective equipment for addressing the pandemic. The administration frequently cites numbers about the supply of masks and gowns because of the scale: millions produced and supplied. There have nonetheless been recent reports of shortages in hard-hit areas of the country.PRIVIL. Likely shorthand for questions about the application of executive PRIVILege by the White House.REOPEN. Talking points on the president\u2019s push to reopen the economy after the coronavirus lockdown. The rush to get back to business encouraged by Trump led many states to skip over recommended benchmarks aimed at preventing a resurgence of the virus.RUSSIA. Another broad category, though with at least two topical applications in the moment.The first concerns recent reports about Russia offering bounties to Taliban fighters for killing American troops, a subject that has come up repeatedly in recent weeks, including in late June. (These notes likely include McEnany\u2019s standard response: Those reports are unconfirmed.) The second is that this week marked the second anniversary of Trump\u2019s meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Finland.SCHEDUL. Presumably the president\u2019s daily schedule for reference.SCHOOL. Above, we noted that \u201cREOPEN\u201d likely referred to reopening the economy precisely because this tab probably refers to Trump\u2019s recent push to get schools to reopen this fall.As soon as a reporter mentioned schools during Thursday\u2019s briefing, McEnany\u2019s eyes darted to the appropriate tab, and she flipped to that page, though her response was broad.She flipped to it again later when asked what Trump would say to parents about the risk of reopening. She offered quotes from experts and noted studies about the limited risk to children (though not to school staff).SHAR[?]. A partially obscured tab. (Think you know what it was? Email us. Reader suggestions: SHARpie, SHARia, SHARpton.)STATUES. Trump has focused heavily on the protection of memorials around the country, seeing the issue as a way of casting his political opponents as foes of American history. This tab likely included talking points centered on defending Trump\u2019s position.STONE. Presumably information about the Stone commutation and criticism of the investigation that led to his arrest and conviction.SYSTEM. Another vague, unclear tabs. (Think you know what it is? Email us. The most common reader suggestion: SYSTEMic racism.)UNIVER. As a reader noted, this may refer to a subset of school reopenings: universities welcoming students back this fall, or not. Several schools have announced specific plans aimed at limiting the spread of the virus.It may also include information about the administration\u2019s brief flirtation with rescinding visas for foreign students enrolled in U.S. universities which were only conducting classes online. After causing a furor as college scrambled to figure out how it might apply to their students, the policy was not put into effect.WINS. The Trump administration likes to tout its successes, generally presenting its accomplishments as the endpoint of possible achievement. Trump himself has often listed a number of things he argues show his presidency as historically successful. There\u2019s every reason to believe that McEnany was prepared to do the same if needed.Those were all of the subjects visible on Thursday.There\u2019s one point, though, that bears repeating about McEnany\u2019s tab-based approach to fielding questions. It is the case that some of the information contained in her binder is useful and directed to natural inquiries from the media. It is also the case that much of the information and, in fact, many of the subjects for which she was prepared were simply intended to inject talking points into the discussion and/or to pull a bit of political judo. You want to talk about an indicted Republican? Well, let\u2019s talk about a mail truck catching fire.Earlier this month, McEnany ended her briefing the way Thursday\u2019s began, talking about crime in U.S. cities.\u201cYou know,\u201d she complained, \u201cI was asked probably 12 questions about the Confederate flag. This president is focused on action, and I\u2019m a little dismayed that I didn\u2019t receive one question on the deaths that we got in this country this weekend.\u201dShe rattled off some statistics that she presented as bolstering her case. She came prepared to win the argument, even if she had to gin up the argument herself.", "comment": "647 Comments", "topic": "Politics"}, {"cover": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/VPLCDHF2HQI6VPNPUEU7SIICN4.jpghttps://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/VPLCDHF2HQI6VPNPUEU7SIICN4.jpg", "title": "A Wuhan writer, on the ground at the center of the outbreak", "date": "Jul 2, 2020", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/a-wuhan-writers-life-during-the-outbreak-censorship-misinformation-and-anger/2020/07/01/f2919df6-ab4a-11ea-9063-e69bd6520940_story.html", "keyword": "China and the world order", "website": "the Washington Post", "author": "James Mann", "content": "In the 1980s, just after China opened its doors to the outside world, Americans tended to look on the country mostly as a source of wonder and bemusement: Look, people in China are starting to play golf! to go bowling! to keep dogs as pets! to open a stock market! I was a reporter in Beijing at the time, and my colleagues from the American TV networks used to joke that what their bosses back home most wanted was some heartwarming or wacky story that could wrap up the broadcast, so that the anchor could put on a wry smile and say, \u201cAaaand in China .\u2009.\u2009.\u00a0.\u201d Then, in 1989, the People\u2019s Liberation Army fired on demonstrators in the heart of Beijing \u2014 and the American perceptions of China as cute quickly faded.But the images of the Tiananmen Square crackdown were set aside in the 1990s and 2000s, as China became a vehicle for domestic political narratives on both the left and the right. Americans were hopeful: China, it was thought, was evolving in our direction. For economic conservatives, the country was said to be proving the virtues of capitalism and free enterprise (never mind its enormous state enterprises). For liberals like Bill Clinton, China would demonstrate the virtues of globalization, which would inevitably open up the country\u2019s political system. Such ideas held sway until Chinese Communist Party leader Xi Jinping came to power in 2012 and made abundantly clear that China was headed for neither free enterprise nor a free press nor any other sort of political change.Support our journalism. Subscribe today.arrow-rightNow, we have a new inflection point in American perceptions of China: the coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan, which spread from this city in central China, eliciting conspiracy theories about its origins, including from President Trump.  Polls by Harris and Pew have shown that the pandemic has brought with it increasingly negative views about China in the United States. Amid the maelstrom of controversy and abstract theorizing over the handling of the virus in China, Fang Fang\u2019s new book, \u201cWuhan Diary,\u201d provides a welcome sense of earthy reality. The book tells the story of the virus at ground level: what the author, a resident of Wuhan, observed and how she and the people around her felt during the crucial weeks of the outbreak and lockdown of the city early this year.ADADFang Fang is a 65-year-old writer who sent out her thoughts and impressions on social media in China day by day from January through March, as the virus spread and as the city was locked down and then eventually opened up. Sometimes her posts were censored; sometimes a friend helped to repost them and get them out.Fang Fang\u2019s battles with the censors \u2014 and with nationalistic trolls on social media who didn\u2019t like the postings that did get out \u2014 become part of the narrative. \u201cAll the internet censorship has begun to elicit the wrath of the people,\u201d she writes at one point. \u201cPosts get deleted, then reposted, over and over again. .\u2009.\u2009. Once things get to this point, I have to ask my dear internet censors, do you think you can really delete it all?\u201dThe book is strikingly critical of the Chinese Communist Party \u2014 the leaders in Beijing and, especially, the party cadres at the local level who suppressed the fact that the virus is intensely contagious. \u201cThe political leaders here in Wuhan have requested that the citizens provide a public expression of gratitude toward the Chinese Communist Party,\u201d she reports at one point, adding, \u201cGovernments are servants of the people, not the other way round.\u201dADADOn the other hand, the book presents an entirely human portrait of life in China. In fact \u2014 and this is the supreme irony \u2014 Fang Fang\u2019s account makes clear that as the geopolitical differences between the Chinese regime and the United States grow by the day, the lives of middle-class Chinese meanwhile seem ever less exotic and ever more similar to those of Americans.Fang Fang has quite a bit to say about the protracted delay by Chinese officials in acknowledging that the virus can be transmitted through ordinary human contact.At the beginning of January, as residents of Wuhan were becoming ill in increasing numbers, the Chinese regime sent experts to the city to report on what was happening. Their report was summarized in eight words that Fang Fang repeats several times: \u201cNot contagious between people. It\u2019s controllable and preventable.\u201d It was only several weeks later that the regime acknowledged the spreading contagion and ordered the city to be shut down.ADADFang Fang argues that the Chinese officials responsible for those \u201cnot contagious\u201d claims should be punished or fired. \u201cI wonder how many people were driven to their deaths by those words,\u201d she writes. \u201cHow can we not fight for justice for those wronged souls? Holding people accountable is something we must do!\u201dShe extends her critique to the official Chinese press, which she says published not a word about the contagion through late January, while provincial government officials held a 40,000-person banquet in Wuhan. Even as she and her friends knew by word of mouth to wear masks when they went outside, she says, \u201ceach issue of our newspapers continues to be filled with vibrant colors, smiling faces, red flags, beautiful flowers, cries of joy.\u201dWhen Chinese officials finally acknowledged the contagion and began to respond to it, the news reports and pictures from Wuhan at first seemed like one of those only-in-China stories. When large numbers of Chinese workers were enlisted to construct a temporary hospital for covid-19 patients within barely a week, it called to mind how in 1959, under orders from Mao Zedong, the massive Great Hall of the People was finished in nine months.ADADAnd yet it was barely 10 weeks after that Wuhan hospital was built that New York officials found themselves rushing to turn the Javits Convention Center into their own temporary hospital. In general, Fang Fang\u2019s book shows that, thanks to the spread of the virus, what seemed unique to Wuhan in January and February became commonplace to Americans in March and April \u2014 not just for medical matters but for daily life.\u201cOnline shopping, binge-watching, sleeping. This is our life now,\u201d writes Fang Fang on March 4. She records how, during the lockdown, she misses the maid who cleans her apartment; how her friends are arranging neighborhood haircuts when they can no longer go to the barber. And, far more seriously, she describes how those in Wuhan who were stricken with covid-19 sometimes died alone in hospitals that their families were banned from visiting, and how the local crematoria were overwhelmed by the rapid influx of corpses. In all of this, Wuhan now seems in retrospect like the advance guard for what would soon happen elsewhere.But looming in the background is China\u2019s distinctive, intensely repressive political system, which stands apart. \u201cWuhan Diary\u201d provides context and insight about the way it works in China at the ground level and for an individual writer. Fang Fang does manage at least sometimes to get her writings past the regime\u2019s official censors and onto social media. When she does, though, she is bombarded with hostile posts saying she should not be criticizing party officials or China \u2014 with one troll suggesting that she was a \u201crunning dog for the Americans.\u201dADADHer portrait of Chinese politics is not at all monochromatic. She attacks her critics as \u201cultra leftists\u201d and says they pose \u201can existential threat to China and her people.\u201d They are opposed to the economic reforms of the past four decades, she suggests.Above all, Fang Fang is bitingly critical of the flag-waving patriotism exhibited by Chinese officials and their online supporters. \u201cWhat really needs to be said is that the true test of a country\u2019s level of civility has nothing to do with building the tallest skyscraper or driving the fastest car, nor does it matter how advanced your military might be; it is also not about how advanced your technology is or even your artistic achievement,\u201d Fang Fang says. \u201cThere is only one true test, and that is how you treat the weakest and most vulnerable members of your society.\u201dShe was talking about China, but it might almost seem as if she were writing about the United States.Wuhan DiaryDispatches From a Quarantined CityBy Fang FangTranslated by Michael BerryHarperVia. 327 pp. $19.99 Kindle", "comment": "1 Comments", "topic": "Outlook"}, {"cover": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/53IONXGFA4I6VKBFQ4RAATSBKA.jpghttps://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/53IONXGFA4I6VKBFQ4RAATSBKA.jpg", "title": "The Daily 202: Trump\u2019s move to weaken key environmental law could sideline communities of color", "date": "Jul 13, 2020", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/the-daily-202-trumps-move-to-weaken-key-environmental-law-could-sideline-communities-of-color/2020/07/13/ea575dc4-a466-4b1b-a9cf-b96424128bb7_story.html", "keyword": "China and the world order", "website": "the Washington Post", "author": "Juliet Eilperin", "content": "with Mariana AlfaroNote to readers: James Hohmann is on vacation until July 20.

Subscribe today.arrow-rightAt a moment when many communities of color are calling for greater input in public policy, President Trump is seeking to overhaul one of the nation's most powerful environmental laws in a way that could minimize their voices.On Wednesday, the president is slated to finalize changes to the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), which requires the federal government to analyze how a major decision affects the environment and take public comment. Trump will travel to Atlanta to make the case that scaling back the 50 year-old statute will speed the construction of highways, pipelines and other infrastructure projects across the country. His cheerleading for a robust economic rebound comes in the midst of the novel coronavirus pandemic that continues to set new infection records.NEPA has emerged as a major legal counterweight to the Trump administration\u2019s policy agenda.\u00a0And it's one of the most effective ways Americans of color have pushed back against plans that could harm their health and environment. Business groups and some unions, however, argue that it is a burdensome and complex law that has exponentially increased the cost and time it takes to modernize America\u2019s infrastructure.ADADAsked about the new rule, White House spokesman Judd Deere said in an email, \u201cThe President will continue to take action to facilitate the great American comeback and to improve the quality of life [for] all Americans.\u201dIn the past few months alone, challenges involving the law have halted at least three multibillion-dollar projects championed by the administration and its allies in the energy industry: the Keystone XL pipeline, the Dakota Access pipeline and the Atlantic Coast pipeline. In late June, a federal judge ordered the U.S. Forest Service to redo its environmental impact assessment for a plan to log old-growth trees across 1.8 million acres of Alaska\u2019s Tongass National Forest, after finding the initial proposal violated the law\u2019s basic requirements.Back in January, the White House proposed major changes to NEPA to limit which projects it applied to, how the government would calculate a proposal\u2019s environmental impacts and how long the public would have to weigh in on any given decision.ADADThese changes include eliminating the requirement to examine a project\u2019s cumulative impact, including taking into account other projects in the area; requiring the most complex analyses be completed within two years; and prohibiting agencies from calculating the climate impact of burning fossil fuels extracted from federal lands or waters once they reach their final destination.\u201cIt\u2019s just massive,\u201d said Raul Garcia, legislative director for healthy communities in the policy and legislative department of Earthjustice, an environmental law group, referring to the administration's NEPA overhaul.\u00a0He argued the administration is rewriting the law \u201cwith the overall goal of excluding the public, undermining the study of the impacts that our federal infrastructure has on our communities and cutting a blank check for companies to do whatever they want when it comes to affecting public health and safety.\u201dA coalition of groups \u2014 energy, farming, logging, ranching and chemical manufacturers \u2014 seeks to scale back NEPA.\u00a0Marty Durbin, president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce\u2019s Global Energy Institute, said in a phone interview Saturday the administration\u2019s overhaul will \u201cprovide predictability and transparency\u201d so developers can learn whether a project is viable. The lengthy analysis required under the law, coupled with the legal challenges that almost inevitably follow, can delay proposals for several years.ADAD\u201cThe question is, can we have a process in place here that, in a reasonable time frame, can get us to a yes or a no,\u201d he said. \u201cWe totally support environmental reviews of whatever\u2019s necessary, and community input.\u201dFor decades, developers have deliberately built polluting operations \u2014 including trash incinerators, coal stacks and chemical plants \u2014 near low-income communities and communities of color. A study published last year in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences found African Americans bear a \u201cpollution burden\u201d that is 56 percent higher than other Americans, on average, relative to what they spend on goods and services. Hispanics have a pollution burden that is 63 percent higher, the researchers found.Durbin argued that going forward, industries can rectify these wrongs by building mass transit and renewable energy projects under a streamlined law.ADAD\u201cWe should look at this as an opportunity to provide more economic growth to those areas and have more environmentally sustainable projects in those communities,\u201d he said. \u201cWe clearly have to recognize things we didn\u2019t do right in past, so how do we build them going forward?\u201dBut the Coalition for Healthy Ports\u2019 Kim Gaddy, a 56-year-old activist living in the South Ward of Newark, said in a phone interview that the long-standing environmental law is a critical tool in fending off development contributing to the city\u2019s higher rates of cancer and lung disease.Gaddy has three children with asthma, ages 31, 20 and 16. The area is already home to long-haul diesel trucks shipping goods from the New York-New Jersey Port, Newark Liberty International Airport, the largest incinerator in the Northeast, a natural-gas power plant and another gas plant being proposed by NJ Transit.\u00a0ADADResidents in Newark\u2019s East Ward, known as the Ironbound, convinced policymakers to reroute some heavy trucks off local streets by using NEPA. Gaddy said she fears the NEPA changes will weaken residents\u2019 ability to push back on additional development.\u201cOur main issue is we already suffer from the cumulative impacts of pollution that has disproportionately impacted people of color. So one of the reasons we are fighting for NEPA is that NEPA at least allows us to have a voice,\u201d she said, adding the White House shouldn\u2019t be changing the law \u201cin this day and age of police brutality, of covid-19, when more of us are impacted because we have compromised health systems.\u201d\u00a0\u201cSo now you\u2019re silencing us totally,\u201d Gaddy said. \u201cYou\u2019re forcing us to accept more pollution.\u201dWhile you were sleepingThe Washington Redskins will change their name.\u00a0\u201cThe Washington Redskins plan to announce Monday morning that they will change their team name, three people with knowledge of the situation confirmed Sunday night. The team is not expected to reveal a new name until a later date,\u201d Les Carpenter and Mark Maske report. \u201cTwo people with knowledge of the team\u2019s plans said Sunday that the preferred replacement name is tied up in a trademark fight, which is why the team can\u2019t announce the new name Monday. \u2026 The decision to change the nearly 87-year-old team name comes amid mounting pressure on the franchise from corporate sponsors and the broader nationwide discussion of race.\u201d\u00a0China imposes sanctions on GOP Sens. Marco Rubio (Fla.) and Ted Cruz (Texas).They are for \u201cinterfering in China's internal affairs,\u201d The Post reports. \u201cNo details were disclosed on what the sanctions would involve, but the move comes days after the Trump administration banned three Chinese officials from visiting the United States and froze any U.S. assets they might have.\u201d The sanctions also extend to former Kansas governor Sam Brownback (R), Trump's ambassador for international religious freedom, and Rep. Christopher H. Smith (R-N.J.).The coronavirusLong delays in getting test results are hobbling the coronavirus response.\u00a0\u201cTest results for the novel coronavirus are taking so long to come back that experts say the results across the United States are often proving useless in the campaign to control the deadly disease,\u201d Rachel Weiner, William Wan and Abigail Hauslohner report. \u201cSome testing sites are struggling to provide results in five to seven days. Others are taking even longer. Outbreaks across the Sun Belt have strained labs beyond capacity. That rising demand, in turn, has caused shortages of swabs, chemical reagents and equipment as far away as New York. The long testing turnaround times are making it impossible for the United States to replicate the central strategy used by other countries to effectively contain the virus \u2014 test, trace and isolate. \u2026\u00a0ADAD\u201cAfter attending a funeral, Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms (D) and her family got tested June 29 as a precaution. No one in her family had developed symptoms. A week later, her test results still hadn\u2019t come back, but her husband started feeling ill. So they got a different, rapid test through Emory University. Within hours, Bottoms learned that she, her husband and one of the couple\u2019s four children had all become infected. It wasn\u2019t until the next day that their initial test results finally arrived. They showed that when the family first got tested, only one of them, the child, had the virus. While they waited for their test results, the boy possibly passed it to his parents. \u2026\u201cMore efficient testing \u2014 such as in South Korea, where results are often given the next day \u2014 might have prevented the Bottomses from getting the virus. But such turnarounds seem out of reach in the United States because of a lack of federal coordination, supply shortages and surging demand as outbreaks in some states spiral out of control.\"The U.S. has recorded 3.29 million cases and more than 132,000 deaths. Two Trump health officials warned that more will die.\u201cAdm. Brett Giroir, an assistant secretary with the Health and Human Services department, and Dr. Jerome Adams, the surgeon general, both emphasized their concern about surging outbreaks, many of them in areas where people have not followed recommended public health guidelines to contain the spread of the virus,\u201d the Times reports. \u201c\u2018We\u2019re all very concerned about the rise in cases, no doubt about that,\u2019 [Giroir] said.\u2019 \u2018We do expect deaths to go up,\u2019 \u2026\u2018If you have more cases, more hospitalizations, we do expect to see that over the next two or three weeks before this turns around.\u2019 Still, [Giroir] and Dr. Adams offered up a few optimistic notes. Admiral Giroir said the percentage of positive test results was leveling off, and both officials said that doctors had better tools to treat people who become sick than they did at the start of the pandemic. \u2026\u00a0ADAD\u201cBoth health officials were questioned about the administration\u2019s reluctance to consider returning to a lockdown in some cities and states. Asked on \u2018This Week\u2019 if states with stark increases in cases, like Florida, South Carolina, Arizona, Texas and Georgia, should consider more stringent measures, [Giroir] said \u2018everything should be on the table.\u2019 He said closing bars and limiting the number of patrons allowed in restaurants were \u2018two measures that really do need to be done.\u2019 \u2026 Dr. Adams struck a similar tone \u2026 Appearing on \u2018Face the Nation,\u2019 Dr. Scott Gottlieb, a former commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration in the Trump administration, said, \u2018I think things are going to get worse before they get better.\u2019\u201dFlorida reported more than 15,000 positive cases \u2013 the highest single-day number for any state.\u00a0\u201cFlorida health officials on Sunday reported 15,300 new confirmed cases of COVID-19 \u2014 more than any other state in America has previously reported in a single day. The number in the Florida Department of Health\u2019s latest update blew past the previous high, 12,274 by New York on April 4, and past Florida\u2019s previous high of 11,458 on July 4,\u201d the Miami Herald reports. \u201cWhile the figure reflects Florida\u2019s ballooning case numbers in recent weeks, it may also be the result of a dramatic one-day rise in the number of reported test results. \u2026 But a Herald analysis this past week found disturbing two-week trends \u2014 of increasing positivity and rising numbers of confirmed cases, even as testing volume remained the same. Florida has now had 269,811 confirmed case \u2026 [Republican Gov. Ron] DeSantis has recommended the wearing of face masks, but he has resisted calls to mandate it \u2026 Miami-Dade County Mayor Carlos Gimenez told CNN on Sunday that the county\u2019s hospitals will soon reach capacity, but he said more beds can be added, including for intensive care. \u2026\u00a0ADAD\u201cHealth experts are concerned that people are gathering in crowds, and have expressed concern that the Republican National Convention\u2019s nomination party for Trump is scheduled to be held in Jacksonville in August. A commissioner for a county near Jacksonville is seriously ill with the virus, according to a posting by his daughter on Facebook. \u2026 On Saturday, the Magic Kingdom and Animal Kingdom reopened at Walt Disney World in Orlando, concerning health experts who urge people not to gather in groups. Guests at the park said that people were wearing masks and social distancing, and videos showed near-empty parks.\u201dThe White House is trying to discredit Tony Fauci.\u201cFauci no longer briefs Trump and is \u2018never in the Oval [Office] anymore,\u2019 said a senior administration official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. Fauci last spoke to the president during the first week of June, according to a person with knowledge of Trump\u2019s calendar,\" write Yasmeen Abutaleb, Josh Dawsey and Laurie McGinley.\u00a0\"A White House official released a statement saying that \u201cseveral White House officials are concerned about the number of times Dr. Fauci has been wrong on things\u201d and included a lengthy list of the scientist\u2019s comments from early in the outbreak. Those included his early doubt that people with no symptoms could play a significant role in spreading the virus \u2014 a notion based on earlier outbreaks that the novel coronavirus would turn on its head. They also point to public reassurances Fauci made in late February, around the time of the first U.S. case of community transmission, that \u201cat this moment, there is no need to change anything that you\u2019re doing on a day-by-day basis.\u201dBetsy DeVos made it clear she wants schools to fully reopen for most students.\u00a0\u201cDeVos made her latest statement about what schools should do on CNN\u2019s \u2018State of the Union.\u2019 In the interview with journalist Dana Bash, DeVos doubled down on calls she made last week for schools to reopen. \u2018Kids need to be in school,\u2019 she said. \u2018They need to be learning, they need to be moving ahead. And we can\u2019t \u2014 we cannot be paralyzed and not allow that or not be intent on that happening,\u2019\u201d Valerie Strauss reports. \u201cDeVos said nothing, however, about what school superintendents have been saying they need to reopen: billions of dollars in additional federal funding to cover the costs of changes they have to make and personal protective equipment they need to buy.\u201dFairfax County, Va., schools superintendent Scott Brabrand \u2013 one of the largest U.S. public school systems \u2013 said DeVos \u201ccan\u2019t put every kid back in a school.\u201d\u00a0DeVos has called out Fairfax County\u2019s plan to have students attend in-person schooling twice weekly while spending the other days in remote learning. Brabrand hit back, saying that \u201cthe guidelines for 6 feet social distancing simply mean that you can't put every kid back in a school with the existing square footage footprint. It's just that simple.\u201d (CNN)\u201cI wouldn\u2019t trust you to care for a house plant let alone my child,\" said Rep. Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.) in response to DeVos's push to fully reopen schools. Pressley was among several Democratic lawmakers, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (Calif.), Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (N.Y.) and Sen. Kamala D. Harris (Calif.), who publicly blasted DeVos following her Sunday claims. Pelosi accused Trump and his administration of \u201cmessing with the health of our children,\u201d noting, \u201cGoing back to school presents the biggest risk for the spread of the coronavirus.\u201d (Allyson Chiu)\u00a0A ray of hope: New York City reported zero coronavirus deaths for the first time since March.\u00a0\u201cAccording to initial data reported by the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, no one died from the virus in New York City on July 11. Officials recorded no confirmed deaths the day before as well, but did have two probable death. The department's data shows there hasn't been a day without a coronavirus-related death since March 13, two days after the first reported death,\u201d NBC New York reports. \u00a0California\u2019s failure on early mass testing led to the current surge.\u00a0\u201cCalifornia found itself unprepared, overwhelmed and constantly lagging,\u201d the Los Angeles Times found. \u201cThose early failures left California far behind in the fight against the coronavirus, and it has struggled to keep up \u2014 even as cases surge today. In the beginning, dozens of investigators, called \u2018cluster busters,\u2019 worked each case to try to contain the spread of the coronavirus. They aimed at identifying each strand of transmission and snipping it before the virus could take hold as a sturdy web across communities. They functioned as all-inclusive personal assistants: arranging child care, setting up WiFi, coordinating grocery drop-offs. But data would later show that, long before the official case count began to climb, the virus was freewheeling. Federal officials grappling with a shortage of test kits issued narrow testing criteria; that meant key local spreaders in the state\u2019s budding outbreak were going unnoticed and untraced.\u201d\u00a0Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner and Harris County Judge Lina Hidalgo, both Democrats, are calling for Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) to impose a statewide stay-at-home order amid surging case numbers. Regional cases rose to 63,864 on Sunday. At least 258,658 cases have been reported in the state, per our tracker. Abbott said he might consider shutting down more nonessential businesses if things worsen. (Houston Chronicle)Three Arizona teachers who shared a summer classroom contracted the virus, leaving one of them dead. Kimberley Chavez Lopez Byrd, 61, died last month, less than two weeks after she was hospitalized. All three teachers wore masks and gloves, according to school officials. The state topped 122,000 cases this weekend. (CNN)Several people who attended a huge sandbar party in Michigan for the Fourth of July have tested positive for the virus, officials said. The event was so crowded that health authorities said it\u2019s impossible to track all the people the infected attendees came into contact with. Footage from the event shows thousands partying hip-to-hip in the water. (M Live)Disagreements between the Fed and Treasury slowed down the start of the Main Street Lending Program.\u00a0\u201cThe differences centered on how to craft the loan terms of [the $600 billion program] to help support businesses through the early stages of the pandemic,\u201d the WSJ reports. \u201cFed officials generally favored easier terms that would increase the risk of the government losing money, while Treasury officials preferred a more conservative approach, people familiar with the process said. Treasury, which has put up $75 billion to cover losses, resisted recent changes to relax loan terms. \u2026 The upshot is that the program, announced in March, went through multiple revisions and opened for business this past week. As of Wednesday, it hadn\u2019t purchased any loans. Some Fed officials privately have voiced frustration that painstaking negotiations wasted precious weeks in launching the program.\u201dThe Trump presidencySen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said Bob Mueller may be called to testify after publishing an op-ed on Roger Stone.Graham, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, \u201cdidn\u2019t give any details on the timing of any potential invitation,\u201d Felicia Sonmez reports. \u201cGraham\u2019s statement came one day after Mueller defended his office\u2019s prosecution of Stone, Trump\u2019s longtime friend and political adviser, in a Post op-ed. Trump commuted Stone\u2019s 40-month prison sentence on Friday \u2026 In his statement Sunday, Graham suggested that he had reconsidered his position on allowing Mueller to testify in light of the former special counsel\u2019s op-ed. \u2018Apparently Mr. Mueller is willing \u2014 and also capable \u2014 of defending the Mueller investigation through an oped in the Washington Post,\u2019 Graham said. \u2018Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee have previously requested Mr. Mueller appear before the Senate Judiciary Committee to testify about his investigation. That request will be granted.\u2019 \u2026 A Graham spokeswoman, said a formal invitation to Mueller is in the works but did not provide details on the timing of any potential testimony. There are only about three dozen legislative days remaining for the Senate before the November election. \u2026\u201cTrump\u2019s commutation of Stone\u2019s sentence has triggered a flood of criticism, with Democrats \u2014 and a handful of Republicans \u2014 in recent days arguing that the move amounted to an abuse of presidential power and an effort to undermine the justice system. On Sunday, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) said that \u2018anyone who cares about the rule of law in this country\u2019 should be \u2018nauseated\u2019 by Trump\u2019s actions in the Stone case. \u2026 Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan (R) also criticized Trump\u2019s commutation of Stone\u2019s sentence, calling it a \u2018problem.\u2019 \u2018The president does have the right, by law, to take the action he took,\u2019 Hogan said on NBC News\u2019s \u2018Meet the Press.\u2019 \u2018That doesn\u2019t mean he should have.\u2019 \u2026 Trump fired back at two of the Republicans who have criticized him \u2014 Sens. Mitt Romney (Utah) and Patrick J. Toomey (Pa.) \u2014 in a tweet on Saturday night in which he called them \u2018RINO\u2019S.\u2019\u201dStone plans on campaigning for Trump now that he \u201cwon\u2019t die in a squalid hellhole of corona-19 virus.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m asthmatic,\u201d he told Axios. \u201cSending me to a prison where I could not be socially distanced ... would, I think, be a death sentence.\u201d He said he\u2019ll do \u201canything necessary to elect my candidate, short of breaking the law.\u201dTrump has made more than 20,000 false or misleading claims.\u201cIt took Trump 827 days to top 10,000 false and misleading claims in The Fact Checker\u2019s database, an average of 12 claims a day. But on July 9, just 440 days later, the president crossed the 20,000 mark \u2014 an average of 23 claims a day over a 14-month period,\u201d Glenn Kessler, Salvador Rizzo and Meg Kelly report. \u201cThe coronavirus pandemic has spawned a whole new genre of Trump\u2019s falsehoods. The category in just a few months has reached nearly 1,000 claims, more than his tax claims combined.\u201dMark Meadows has been feeding nuggets of information to suspected leakers to see if they pass them on.\u00a0So far, Meadows, Trump\u2019s chief of staff, has yet to discover any leakers, Axios reports. \u201cA source familiar with Meadows' thinking said he is \u2018focused on national security leaks and could care less about the palace intrigue stories.\u2019 On a recent podcast with Ted Cruz, however, Meadows said they tracked down and fired a federal employee who leaked information about a White House social media executive order.\u201d\u00a0Trump lashed out against supporters who built a portion of the border wall in his honor.\u201cTrump on Sunday criticized a privately built border wall in South Texas that\u2019s showing signs of erosion months after going up, saying it was \u2018only done to make me look bad,\u2019 even though the wall was built after a months-long campaign by his supporters,\u201d the AP reports. \u201cThe group that raised money online for the wall promoted itself as supporting Trump during a government shutdown that started in December 2018 because Congress wouldn\u2019t fund Trump\u2019s demands for a border wall. Called \u2018We Build the Wall,\u2019 the group has raised more than $25 million promoting itself as supporting the president. Former Trump chief strategist Steve Bannon joined the group\u2019s board and Trump ally Kris Kobach became its general counsel. \u2026 The section in question is a roughly 3-mile (5-kilometer) fence of steel posts just 35 feet (10 meters) from the Rio Grande, the river that forms the U.S.-Mexico border in Texas. That\u2019s much closer to the river than the government ordinarily builds border barriers in South Texas because of concerns about erosion and flooding that could violate U.S. treaty obligations with Mexico.\u201d\u00a0The electionTrump campaign manager Brad Parscale is hitting a rough patch.\u201cAs Trump\u2019s reelection effort struggles, Parscale, despite his self-promotion, increasingly finds himself out of favor with his boss and hemmed in by newly hired staffers and recently promoted advisers, according to people familiar with the campaign,\u201d Michael Scherer and Josh Dawsey report. \u201cTrump has made clear his displeasure with Parscale, especially after a disappointing rally in Tulsa, and the campaign has expanded its senior team in ways that diminish his role, according to multiple campaign and administration officials. Trump\u2019s new kitchen cabinet, a combination of White House and campaign employees led by White House senior adviser Jared Kushner, includes Parscale\u2019s recently promoted deputy Bill Stepien and two communications aides from the 2016 campaign \u2014 Hope Hicks and Jason Miller, who was recently hired by the campaign and is increasingly seen as its principal strategist. \u2026 [C]ampaign and White House officials say Parscale does not always appear to understand the political dynamics of crucial swing states. \u2026 A senior Trump administration official \u2026 said Parscale \u2018knows he screwed up\u2019 with the Trump rally\u2026\u00a0\u201c[Parscale is also absent] from campaign headquarters. Parscale lives in Florida, and the campaign is based in Northern Virginia, and staffers say that when they talk to him, he is often by his pool in Fort Lauderdale. \u2026 The amount of money that Parscale has personally earned from the campaign is undisclosed in Federal Election Commission reports, because the reports do not distinguish between the money that goes directly to him and the payments that go to his firm, Parscale Strategies, for pass-through costs. \u2026 Between September 2019 and May 2020, [Trump and GOP] accounts paid Parscale Strategies an average of $100,905 a month. \u2026 In comparison, records show that Biden\u2019s campaign manager, Jen O\u2019Malley Dillon, has been paid $11,486 a month since taking over in April.\u201d\u00a0The pandemic has reshaped the presidential race in the Sun Belt.\u00a0\u201cBiden is now leading Trump by six points in Florida, and the two are tied in Arizona and competitive in Texas, where Biden is down by just a point to Mr. Trump. Biden has made gains in part because most say their state's efforts to contain the virus are going badly \u2014 and the more concerned voters are about risks from the outbreak, the more likely they are to support Biden,\u201d a CBS News poll found. \u201cIn all three states, most voters say their state reopened too soon, and those who say this feel their state went too fast under pressure from the Trump administration. Most also say the president is doing a bad job handling the outbreak. He may be paying a price for that, at least in the short term.\u201d\u00a0Biden has a five-point lead over Trump in Texas, per a Dallas Morning News-University of Texas at Tyler poll.\u00a0The Biden campaign, though, has done little to demonstrate it will make a major push in the Lone Star State. Texas hasn\u2019t voted for a Democratic presidential candidate since Jimmy Carter in 1976.Trump\u2019s battle against Michigan\u2019s female leaders could have 2020 implications.\u00a0\u201cBeyond being the women leading Michigan\u2019s state government, Gretchen Whitmer, Dana Nessel and Jocelyn Benson have a lot in common,\u201d the Times reports. \u201cBy 2018, the three were swept into statewide office on a wave that flipped much of Michigan\u2019s leadership from red to blue and put three women \u2014 Ms. Whitmer, the governor; Ms. Nessel, the attorney general; and Ms. Benson, the secretary of state \u2014 in charge of running the state for the first time. Now these women share another distinction: They\u2019re all targets of Trump. Trailing in polls to Biden in this key battleground state, the president has taken aggressive aim at [them] zeroing in on their mission to expand voting rights in a state where his 2016 winning margin of just 10,704 votes was the narrowest in the country. The three women have in turn responded forcefully to Mr. Trump \u2026 Michigan Democrats believe that the state leaders are a not-so-secret weapon in the 2020 election. They see the president\u2019s frequent barbs \u2026 as helping fuel the anti-Trump bandwagon in the state, which before 2016 had not voted for a Republican presidential candidate since 1988.\u201dQuote of the day\u201cThere\u2019s a tsunami coming,\u201d in November, said former Virginia governor Terry McAuliffe (D) about the Democrats' chances in the general election. \u201cIf [Trump had] early on jumped in front of the coronavirus and been a leader, this guy would\u2019ve been unbeatable. But every opportunity he\u2019s had to stand up and be a leader, whether Charlottesville or anything else, he\u2019s failed each time.\u201d (Philip Rucker, Rachael Bade and Seung Min Kim)\u00a0Social media speed readThe Houston Chronicle's Sunday edition had a stand-alone obituary section:\u00a0Many jumped to Tony Fauci's defense after it was reported that the White House is leading a campaign against him:\u00a0Back in 1998, President George H.W.

An outbreak of the novel coronavirus is killing more people each day than it did at its original peak earlier this year. And a series of explosions, suspected to be part of Israeli operations to damage Iran\u2019s nuclear infrastructure, has exposed severe vulnerabilities in the regime\u2019s ability to protect its most sensitive sites.Support our journalism. Subscribe today.arrow-rightThe government of Ukraine, meanwhile, is preparing to sue Iran for damages over the downing of one of its civilian aircrafts in January, in which all 176 people on board were killed by an Iranian missile.ADIranian officials may very well be feeling the pressure, but if they are, they have a strange way of showing it. Rather than addressing the wide array of problems, they are busily fighting among themselves. Usually they close ranks against external threats, but that\u2019s not what is happening now.ADOne possible reason for the Iranian leaders\u2019 continued air of confidence may well be the massive deal they\u2019re negotiating with China. If successful, it would see hundreds of billions of dollars invested in Iranian infrastructure as part of Beijing\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative.If Iran and China come to terms, it will yet again highlight the failure of the Trump administration\u2019s maximum-pressure campaign against Iran. The stated logic behind the U.S. strategy of unrelenting sanctions is that they will cut Tehran off from access to world markets, forcing it to the negotiating table.ADYet Iranian officials don\u2019t seem terribly concerned. Iran\u2019s embattled foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, has been attempting to remind his critics of their common foe \u2014 but no one seems to be listening. Under intense scrutiny for his handling of Iran\u2019s international relations, Zarif issued an urgent warning to his rivals this week.AD\u201cAmerica doesn\u2019t recognize liberals, reformists, conservatives, revolutionaries or non-revolutionaries,\u201d Zarif, said addressing angry members of parliament on Sunday. \u201cWe\u2019re all in the same boat.\u201dSome U.S. officials undoubtedly view the internal conflict as evidence of the success of their strategy and are preparing to celebrate the imminent fall of the regime. They couldn\u2019t be more wrong. As the China deal shows, the gaps in the maximum-pressure campaign are growing larger by the day.ADFor one thing, the Trump administration\u2019s Iran policy has done nothing to empower viable alternatives to the regime inside Iran. The sad truth is that Iranians who oppose the regime, of which there are many millions as evidenced by widespread protests in recent years, currently pose no meaningful domestic threat to the system. Neither can Trump\u2019s Iran policy architects point to a credible external alternative among the wealthy and highly educated diaspora.ADThe only thing the administration has managed to do is to wreak havoc on an already weak economy. Sanctions are a wrecking ball that destroy the livelihoods of anyone unlucky enough to live in a country targeted by them. But they are incapable of nurturing realistic and honest agents of change.Sanctions exacerbate the worst behavior of corrupt elites. You could argue that this is exactly what they are designed to do, by causing such economic suffering in the hopes that ordinary Iranians will rise up against the regime. In the process they make the lives of ordinary people worse without providing anything in return. Despite the promises of change, sanctions actually deprive those who wish for change of the resources they need in order to make it happen.ADThat\u2019s not to say that this regime will last forever. Of course it won\u2019t. Change is coming to Iran, but there is no one guiding it.ADFigures capable of delivering lasting positive change are conspicuously absent. Why? Because the regime has done whatever it needed to eliminate those threats.In the past, regimes that stood on the wrong side of history \u2014 think of the Soviet Union or apartheid-era South Africa \u2014 found themselves with few good choices. They could either concede to the will of the populations they ruled over or face violent eviction.In Iran, there are two problems standing in the way of the people\u2019s date with destiny.First, the United States can claim no moral high ground when it comes to Iran. Our policies \u2014  whether harsh economic sanctions or travel bans \u2014 have consistently been designed to punish, without offering any clearly positive incentives. Maximum pressure is all sticks, no carrots.ADSecond, China cares little about the regime\u2019s transgressions against the Iranian people. Beijing appears prepared to help keep this regime afloat for the foreseeable future. Any potential influence Washington hoped to have with Iran has been ceded to Beijing.ADOur inflexible policies have cost us an opportunity to influence the course of events in Iran in the short term and perhaps for many decades to come. After trying to cut off all of the options available to the regime, we should hardly be surprised if the regime is willing to accept the way out offered by the Chinese.

But next time, it could be far more serious.\u00a0Support our journalism. Subscribe today.arrow-rightThe unknown hackers held the Twittersphere in thrall last night as they seized control of high-profile accounts and sent phony tweets from Joe Biden, Barack Obama and a who\u2019s who of top companies and business and entertainment leaders. It took Twitter hours of work and an unprecedented shutdown of all verified accounts to halt the operation, as Rachel Lerman, Cat Zakrzewski and I report.U.S. adversaries that gained that sort of power could sow mass chaos on Election Day by tweeting out phony information about voter fraud or polling locations shut down by the coronavirus or terrorist attacks. And because the breach targeted Twitter controls, over which campaigns are powerless, they might have no power to stop the stream of phony tweets from flowing.ADADIf Twitter once again shut down verified accounts' ability to tweet while it investigated a breach, that would also cut off a key avenue for campaigns, government officials and law enforcement to correct misinformation.\u00a0Such an attack could be particularly disastrous during a close election if people don't vote because of the confusion.\u00a0\u201cRussia\u2019s most dangerous play is how do you inflict the maximum amount of chaos on Election Day,\u201d Clint Watts, a\u00a0distinguished research fellow\u00a0at the Foreign Policy Research Institute who tracks Russian influence operations, told me. \u201cThey want to further erode confidence in democracy, and this is emblematic of a way they can do that.\u201d\u00a0ADRachel Tobac, chief executive of SocialProof Security, called the breach very concerning. \u201cWe are extremely lucky that these attackers are monetarily motivated and not sowing mass chaos all over the world,\u201d she said.\u00a0ADOther prominent victims of the breach included the Uber and Apple corporate accounts, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, Tesla founder Elon Musk, musician Kanye West and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. (Bezos also owns The Washington Post.) Those accounts all posted tweets instructing people to send cryptocurrency to the same bitcoin address over the course of about 90 minutes.\u00a0The bitcoin wallet the tweets pointed to appeared to receive more than $115,000.\u00a0The breach underscores the vast array of avenues hackers could take to undermine the election.\u00a0It also provides a window into the long list of possible attacks the Biden and Trump campaigns need to be planning for as November approaches.\u00a0ADIn the case of an Election Day version of the Twitter breach, campaigns should be gaming out how to correct misinformation through traditional media and through other social media that isn\u2019t compromised, Mick Baccio, a security adviser at Splunk, told me. Baccio ran cybersecurity for former South Bend, Ind., mayor Pete Buttigieg\u2019s presidential primary campaign but left shortly before the Iowa caucuses.\u00a0AD\u201cYou have to plan for all these horrible scenarios and you have to have the principals in the room to figure out, \u2018What will you do if this happens? What\u2019s the incident response?\u2019\u201d he said.\u00a0Campaigns should also try to establish strong relationships in advance with the people they\u2019ll need in those situations, such as Twitter\u2019s cybersecurity executives, Baccio said.\u00a0AD\u201cYou have to know what\u2019s inside your scope and what\u2019s not and having contacts at those places is invaluable,\u201d he said.\u00a0This isn\u2019t the first time a Twitter hack has caused widespread confusion.\u00a0Watts compared the breach to a 2013 hack of the Associated Press\u2019s Twitter account that the Syrian Electronic Army claimed credit for. The hacking group, whose members are partisans of embattled Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, sent multiple tweets claiming \u00a0the White House had been bombed and that President Barack Obama was injured. They caused chaos online and briefly tanked the stock market, causing a temporary loss of $136 billion in the S&P 500.\u00a0ADADThat was just one Twitter account whose tweets were quickly refuted by other news agencies \u2014 including by reporters at the White House who could verify everything was fine. Things could be far more complicated if multiple accounts were tweeting false information that couldn\u2019t be so easily refuted.\u00a0More recently, Twitter founder Jack Dorsey\u2019s account was hacked and tweeted a string of obscenities, threats and racial slurs in 2019.\u00a0It\u2019s unclear how much information the hackers were able to cull from the Twitter accounts they compromised.\u00a0If they were able to access the accounts\u2019 direct messages, they might have stolen information they could leak later to embarrass the victims or to sow chaos during the 2020 election or another major event, Theresa Payton, chief executive of the cybersecurity company Fortalice Solutions and a former White House technology official, told me.ADADIt's also possible the hackers stole information from accounts that they didn't use as part of the bitcoin scam that they could later leak or sell to someone with political motivations. For example, President Trump has among the most closely watched Twitter accounts in the world but his account wasn't used in the scheme.\u00a0\u201cWe could be looking at the potential for a huge hacking and dumping campaign,\u201d Payton said.Twitter described the breach as a \u201ccoordinated social engineering attack\u201d aimed at its employees. It said it was \u201clooking into what other malicious activity they may have conducted or information they may have accessed.\u201dDorsey also promised to share more information as soon as the company completes its investigation.\u00a0It's also unclear how the hackers gained access to the Twitter accounts.\u00a0The company's brief accounting suggested the hackers conned Twitter employees into unwittingly giving up information that provided the access. But Vice's Joseph Cox spoke with people who claimed to be responsible for the breach who said they paid a Twitter employee for help gaining access.\u00a0ADADTwitter is also investigating whether an employee might have hijacked the accounts directly and then passed the access along to the hackers, Cox reports.\u00a0One prominent theory, outlined by Vice\u2019s Cox, is that hackers gained access to an internal panel that Twitter employees use to interact with user accounts and were using that access to post their bitcoin scheme to prominent accounts.\u00a0In many cases, the account owners or Twitter were able to quickly delete the scam tweets, suggesting that the hacker hadn\u2019t locked them out of the accounts entirely.\u00a0Chat roomThe Twitter hack also sent shock waves through the cybersecurity community. Google's Shane Huntley drew the lesson that even cybersecurity savvy folks can be conned by phishing attacks.\u00a0Electronic Frontier Foundation Cybersecurity Director Eva Galperin made an argument for more fully encrypting direct messages to protect them against being stolen.The hackers\u2019 seeming profit was pretty paltry, the Daily Beast\u2019s Adam Ranwsley noted:The keysTrump granted the CIA broad authorities to launch secret cyberattacks in 2018.The authorization allowed the agency to launch a wide range of hacks without White House approval and specifically named Russia, China, Iran and North Korea as likely targets, Zach Dorfman, Kim Zetter, Jenna McLaughlin and Sean D. Naylor report for Yahoo News.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0ADADThe agency has carried out at least a dozen covert hacking operations since then, including hacking and dumping files from Iran and Russia, former officials told Yahoo.The new authorities also allowed the agency to more easily conduct covert cyberoperations against banks, media organizations and charities suspected of working with adversary governments.\u00a0\u00a0The White House also expanded authorities for U.S. Cyber Command to launch offensive hacking operations in 2018. That helped enable operations against a Russian troll farm during the 2018 midterm elections and against an Iranian military unit in retaliation for shooting down a U.S. drone.The State Department will restrict U.S. visas of some Huawei employees, citing human rights abuses.Secretary of State Mike Pompeo accused the Huawei employees of providing \u201cmaterial support\u201d to the Chinese Communist Party at a news conference.ADThe action also applies to several other Chinese companies the United States has sanctioned for allegedly aiding human rights abuses. The move is the latest escalation in the United States\u2019 war against Huawei, which it has accused of aiding Chinese government spying.\u201cTelecommunications companies around the world should consider themselves on notice,\u201d Pompeo said.\u00a0\u201cIf they are doing business with Huawei, they are doing business with human rights abusers.\u201dPompeo also praised the United Kingdom\u2019s decision to phase out Huawei\u2019s equipment from its 5G telecom networks.\u00a0\u201cThis isn\u2019t about commercial interests, this is about protecting the information,\u201d Pompeo said. \u201cI think in fact the tide has turned there and you\u2019ll see this continue in [other] countries.\u201d\u00a0Pompeo is also sounding alarms about election interference.\u00a0The secretary of state said he\u2019s \u201cconfident\u201d foreign countries \u201cwould do their best to have an impact\u201d on the 2020 election, during a virtual event hosted by the Hill, Maggie Miller reports.\u201cForeign efforts to interfere in American elections is something we constantly must contend with, and we\u2019ll contend with that here,\u201d Pompeo said.Pompeo believes the U.S. government will be able to knock back those efforts, he stressed.\u201cWhether it\u2019s Chinese interference, Iranian interference, Russian interference, or North Korean interference, any country, or even nonstate actors who now have capabilities to try to meddle in our elections, know that this administration takes seriously its responsibility to make sure every American\u2019s vote is counted, counted properly, and that foreign influence is minimized,\u201d he said.Hill watchA group of bipartisan lawmakers stumped for a new national cyber director during a House Oversight Committee hearing.\u00a0The new position was a key recommendation of the Cyberspace Solarium Commission. That recommendation has wide support among cybersecurity hawks in Congress, but the White House opposes it. And some Republicans expressed concern during the hearing it could increase bureaucracy rather than reduce it.\u00a0Here\u2019s more from the Hill\u2019s Maggie Miller.Cyber insecurityIBM researchers an Iranian hacking group's training videos.\u00a0The videos included several hours worth of footage of the Iranian government-linked hacking group trying to steal data from members of the U.S. and Greek navies, according to a blog post this morning from IBM's X-Force threat intelligence division.\u00a0The hacking group, which researchers have named Charming Kitten Phosphorus, was earlier blamed for hacking a U.S. presidential campaign that Reuters identified as the Trump campaign.\u00a0More news in hacks, breaches and disinformation:Chinese state hackers target Hong Kong Catholic Church ( ZDNet)Deepfake used to attack activist couple shows new disinformation frontier (Reuters)DaybookThe Aspen Institute will host a discussion about U.S. Election security in the shadow of the coronavirus today at 1 p.m.The House Homeland Security Committee will hold a hearing evaluating the Cyberspace Solarium Commission recommendations Friday at 12:30 p.m.The House Administration Committee will hold a hearing on the security of remote voting in the House on Friday at 1 p.m.The Center for Strategic and International Studies will host a discussion with former Google chairman and chief executive Eric Schmidt about technology, data and innovation policy on Friday at 4 p.m.The Senate Commerce Subcommittee on Manufacturing, Trade, and Consumer Protection will hold a hearing on protecting Americans from coronavirus scams on July 21 at 2:30 p.m.The Senate Rules Committee will hold a hearing on general-election preparations on July 22 at 10:30 a.m.Secure log offIt\u2019s been a long news cycle.", "comment": "3 Comments", "topic": "PowerPost"}, {"cover": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/CGQOKXWATYI6VCIINCRLT2XJ4A.jpghttps://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/CGQOKXWATYI6VCIINCRLT2XJ4A.jpg", "title": "Trump the victim: President complains in private about the pandemic hurting him", "date": "Jul 10, 2020", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-the-victim-president-complains-in-private-about-the-pandemic-hurting-himself/2020/07/09/187142c6-c089-11ea-864a-0dd31b9d6917_story.html", "keyword": "China and the world order", "website": "the Washington Post", "author": "Ashley ParkerPhilip RuckerJosh Dawsey", "content": "Callers on President Trump in recent weeks have come to expect what several allies and advisers describe as a \u201cwoe-is-me\u201d preamble.The president rants about the deadly coronavirus destroying \u201cthe greatest economy,\u201d one he claims to have personally built.

Subscribe today.arrow-rightGone, say these advisers and confidants, many speaking on the condition of anonymity to detail private conversations, are the usual pleasantries and greetings.ADInstead, Trump often launches into a monologue placing himself at the center of the nation\u2019s turmoil. The president has cast himself in the starring role of the blameless victim \u2014 of a deadly pandemic, of a stalled economy, of deep-seated racial unrest, all of which happened to him rather than the country.ADTrump put his self-victimization on public display Thursday in response to a Supreme Court ruling rejecting his claim of absolute immunity and permitting a New York prosecutor to see the president\u2019s private and business financial records.Trump reacted with a social media meltdown, writing on Twitter, \u201cPROSECUTORIAL MISCONDUCT!\u201d and \u201cPOLITICAL WITCH HUNT!\u201d He wrote that the decision was \u201cNot fair to this Presidency\u201d and claimed that \u201cCourts in the past have given \u2019broad deference\u2019. BUT NOT ME!\u201dADTrump has always exhibited a healthy ego and his self-victimization tendencies are not a new phenomenon, according to those who have known him over the years. But those characteristics have been especially pronounced this summer, revealing themselves almost daily in everything from private conversations to public tweets as the pandemic continues to upend daily life across America and threaten the president\u2019s political fortunes.ADBarbara Res, a former executive at the Trump Organization, said that when she worked for Trump, he interpreted nearly everything in deeply personal terms.\u201cWhatever bad happened, no matter what it was, it was always against him, always directed at him,\u201d Res said. \u201cHe would say, \u2018Why does everything always happen to me?\u2019\u2009\u201dShe added: \u201cIt was as if the world revolved around him. Everything that happened had an effect on him, good or bad.\u201dNow, however, Trump\u2019s sense of victimhood strikes even some allies as particularly incongruous considering the devastation wrought by the pandemic and the pain and anguish apparent in Black Lives Matter protests.ADMore than 130,000 Americans so far have died of the novel coronavirus, with more than 3 million cases reported. Nearly 43 million Americans \u2014 more than a quarter of the labor force \u2014 have filed for unemployment benefits since the pandemic began. And the nation is riven not just by protests following the death of George Floyd, the unarmed black man killed in Minneapolis police custody, but also by a president who has deliberately stoked racial animus.ADEven those in Trump\u2019s orbit are trying to nudge him toward a sunnier, less egocentric approach to the crises he is facing, fearing that his sullen demeanor could backfire politically. Among those internally who have advocated a more optimistic tone are Alyssa Farah, the White House communications director, and Jared Kushner, the president\u2019s son-in-law and senior adviser, according to one senior administration official.Trump increasingly preoccupied with defending his physical and mental healthOther top White House advisers \u2014 including Hope Hicks and Dan Scavino \u2014 have also sought to buttress Trump\u2019s mood with events they thought he would enjoy, such as celebrating truckers by bringing 18-wheelers onto the White House South Lawn in mid-April or creating social media videos that feature throngs of his adoring fans, according to aides.ADAdvisers also have sought to boost Trump\u2019s mood by presenting him internal polling that shows him in a better position than public surveys, which universally show him trailing presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden.One senior administration official rejected the notion that Trump views himself as a victim, saying instead that he has repeatedly expressed his frustration over a virus that seemed to emerge out of nowhere and has ravaged the country, and that his only concern is for the victims of the pandemic. A second official said that the president is most frequently speaking about how the country collectively has been victimized by the virus.ADThe first official added that Trump, as a former businessman, is especially well-suited for this unprecedented moment of crisis, and has demonstrated his management abilities by making the decision early on to shut down some travel from China and by waiving regulations to rush coronavirus therapeutics to the market.AD\u201cThe United States of America did not ask for this plague and every American has been affected from the closure of our economy to caring for the sick and mourning those tragically lost, but under the leadership of President Trump our Transition to Greatness has already begun, and the American people are showing tremendous courage to defeat the virus, responsibly open the economy, and restore law and order to our streets,\u201d White House spokesman Judd Deere said in an email statement. \u201cThe President\u2019s message has been consistent: resilience, hope, and optimism.\u201dStay safe and informed with our free Coronavirus Updates newsletterJen Psaki, former communications director in the Obama White House, agreed with private assessments that the president\u2019s complaining could be costly.AD\u201cI don\u2019t think he has many sympathetic ears to his claims that he\u2019s been mistreated,\u201d Psaki said. \u201cLeadership, as we\u2019ve seen at many moments in history, is about not only accepting adulation when you do something great but also accepting responsibility. That lack of accepting responsibility is seen as a lack of leadership and that doesn\u2019t sit well with people who might be more open to supporting him again.\u201dADAt times, though, Trump can\u2019t seem to help himself, said people who have spoken with him in recent weeks, describing him as shellshocked and sullen about his declining fortunes even as he continues to insist he will ultimately win in November.\u201cWe had the greatest economy in the world,\u201d Trump said in an Oval Office meeting last month, talking about how good the statistics were before the coronavirus, said one adviser. An outside adviser in frequent touch with the White House offered a similar recollection, saying that Trump simply keeps on repeating, \u201cI had this great economy and they made me shut it down.\u201dTrump and Biden campaigns shift focus to coronavirus as pandemic surgesAnother adviser who chatted with Trump about a month ago said the president opened with a lengthy rant expressing animus toward reporters \u2014 with Trump citing individual names of journalists and specific stories, particularly those about the coronavirus recovery. This person added that Trump also railed about pollsters being out to get him and deliberately sampling the wrong voters, and complained he was being blamed for protests that he had nothing to do with.A third outside adviser in frequent touch with the White House said that in a recent conversation, the president seemed almost \u201cinconsolable\u201d and summed up Trump\u2019s riff: Gripes about the great economy he built, now felled by the virus, and also how \u201csome stupid cop in Minneapolis kneels on someone\u2019s neck and now everyone is protesting.\u201dADADThe president has also complained to political advisers that the media blames him for the protests in the wake of Floyd\u2019s death, and that no matter what he says, \u201cit is not enough.\u201dTo some of his longtime advisers, the president has seemed tired, low-energy and lacking the passion and energy that defined him when he was a candidate during the 2016 race. Aides noticed he largely read his script at Mount Rushmore and did not veer off the teleprompters for high-energy riffs like he usually does when delivering political speeches.He has been spending an inordinate amount of time watching television news and has been scrambling for ways to fire up his base and keep his loyalists supportive, with little in the way of a set daily schedule.AD\u201cEvery guy that talks to him, the first half of the conversation is, \u2018Woe is me,\u2019\u2009\u201d said one of the outside operatives, speaking anonymously to share private details. \u201cThey\u2019re all saying, \u2018You\u2019ve got to snap out of it. You\u2019re the president. Presidents are supposed to deal with crises.\u2019 But he\u2019s fixated.\u201dADRuth Ben-Ghiat, a history professor at New York University and author of the forthcoming book, \u201cStrongmen,\u201d a history of authoritarian leaders, said Trump\u2019s victimization complex fits a pattern of authoritarian leaders past and present.\u201cThey have no empathy, and they only see the world through how things affect them personally,\u201d Ben-Ghiat said. \u201cThey\u2019re not there to govern. They\u2019re there to enrich themselves, they\u2019re there to plunder the nation, and they\u2019re there to be world historical.\u201dSome officials and advisers, however, say they are encouraged that Trump in recent days has gotten into a more optimistic mind-set, where he sees a path to victory and is ready to work toward it. The president just approved a calendar through the beginning of August that includes coronavirus-focused events, economic events and, they hope, a return to regular political events. Trump had planned to hold a campaign rally in an airport hangar in Portsmouth, N.H., on Saturday night, but it was postponed because of weather. The White House said it would be rescheduled for a week or two from now.June was a tough month for both the country and the president, the senior official said, but Trump\u2019s celebration in South Dakota in advance of July 4 represented something of an unofficial turning point, as aides hope the president will refocus on several top priorities.ADThe key themes for coming weeks, the official added, are rebuilding the nation\u2019s economy, continuing to fight the virus and continuing to secure communities, which will encompass the aftermath of the protests. There may also be some actions intended to show toughness against China.Trump \u2018white power\u2019 tweet set off a scramble inside the White House \u2014 but no clear condemnationThe president\u2019s mood had also improved as he focused on the fight over whether to rename or tear down statues named after Confederate generals and other controversial historical figures. Aides say he believes a battle over such symbols will help him politically.Despite his bouts of moroseness, Trump can also exhibit optimism not entirely grounded in reality. He has continued to tell advisers, for instance, that he is certain the virus will go away by October and that there will be a \u201ccure\u201d by then \u2014 a word he favors over \u201cvaccine.\u201dThen, he adds in these tellings, the economy will rebound overnight and he will win a second term.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "comment": "10k Comments", "topic": "Politics"}, {"cover": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/MDFRN2XUHEI6TMWSD434TWBNXM.jpghttps://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/MDFRN2XUHEI6TMWSD434TWBNXM.jpg", "title": "Trump\u2019s efforts to tighten immigration ignore the contributions of foreign-born workers", "date": "Jul 16, 2020", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/07/16/trumps-efforts-tighten-immigration-ignore-contributions-foreign-born-workers/", "keyword": "China and the world order", "website": "the Washington Post", "author": "", "content": "On Tuesday, the Trump administration backed off an earlier plan to end F-1 visas for international students unless they attended in-person classes on U.S. campuses. This marked the latest twist in a dizzying set of new U.S. immigration policies in recent weeks.Support our journalism. Subscribe today.arrow-rightThe fight over the F-1 visas follows a June executive order by President Trump blocking visas for temporary foreign workers, including H-1B visas for those with specialized skills. Business leaders and immigration advocates remain critical of the suspension of H-1B visas.Tuesday\u2019s Rose Garden news conference remarks by Trump suggest immigration matters remain at the top of the White House agenda. But what\u2019s the real relationship between immigrants and U.S. economic development?Trump wants to limit immigration to protect jobs. Will that work?The administration says these rules put Americans firstDozens of schools and state officials had balked at the F-1 plan, citing the need for online education in the face of the continued threat of covid-19 transmission. The administration\u2019s reversal on F-1 visas came after 19 states, the District of Columbia and a number of U.S. universities initiated lawsuits to block the rule.ADADThe administration defended the new student visa rules by saying they would \u201cencourage U.S. schools to reopen\u201d this fall, which would be good for American students, families and the national economy. The president similarly justified the suspension of H-1B visas for overseas workers with special skills by arguing they represented \u201can unusual threat\u201d in taking away jobs and hampering the economic recovery.The U.S. has long attracted skilled immigrantsOver 50 years ago, the landmark Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 increased immigration rates and replaced an older quota system that gave preference to white, northern Europeans. The new law prioritized immigration visas for three groups: refugees, those with close ties to family already legally established in the U.S. and foreign nationals with special skills or training.ADADThus, for more than half a century, the premise of U.S. immigration policy has been admitting foreign businesspeople, students, scientists and technicians based on merit and ability, rather than race and cultural familiarity promotes U.S. education, industry and economic performance.What\u2019s the evidence that immigrants contribute to the economic development of the United States? MIT, for instance, owes much of its success as a premier research and teaching institution to the talents of its foreign-born teachers, technicians, researchers and students. More than 43 percent of the MIT faculty were born outside the U.S. Almost 100 alumni, faculty and researchers affiliated with the university have won Nobel Prizes \u2014 within this group, more than one-third were foreign born.The Trump administration is curtailing visas for Chinese scientists. That could backfire.Across U.S. universities, foreign-born researchers and teachers are concentrated in high-growth STEM fields. A Congressional Research Service report reveals almost a quarter of all STEM undergraduates and about half of all STEM graduate students are foreign-born, many of whom will remain in this country and work after graduation. Without students and workers from outside the U.S., it\u2019s difficult to see how the current successes of U.S. scientific research and innovation could continue.Immigrants fuel innovationImmigrants in universities are not only integral to the U.S. learning and teaching environment, but they are also central in U.S. academic and business leadership, training a new generation of researchers and professionals.ADADConsider the National Academy of Sciences, arguably the most prestigious U.S. professional organization in the sciences. Annually, the NAS elects a select group of the nation\u2019s most distinguished scientific scholars, with the stipulation that these researchers must be American citizens. Over a recent six-year period, one-third of NAS inductees were foreign-born, hailing from nations as diverse as China, Guatemala, Hungary, Iran, South Africa, Syria, Turkey and Vietnam.Immigrants have become fixtures in innovation hubs like Boston and Silicon Valley and leaders in their fields. One recent report found immigrants have started more than half of America\u2019s start-ups valued at $1 billion or more. The U.S. Patent Office reports inventors born outside the U.S. file about half of the hundreds of thousands of new patents each year.Are U.S. jobs at stake? Research and government studies don\u2019t support the president\u2019s claims that these foreign workers take jobs away from native-born Americans. The H1-B visa program halted by the president is designed to attract essential skills and training in short supply in the U.S. labor pool. The supply of employer-sought high-skill workers is often concentrated in specific global regions, leading to employee shortfalls. Thus, as the Brookings Institution has reported, while more than half of the world\u2019s engineering degrees are earned in Asia, just 4 percent of the global total are issued to U.S. students. The H1-B program helps correct this disjuncture between supply and demand.ADADIn fact, the president\u2019s H1-B executive order recognizes foreign workers are essential. It directs administration officials to create rules exempting immigrants critical to our security needs, those conducting research to help the nation \u201ccombat COVID-19\u201d and anyone facilitating \u201cthe immediate and continued economic recovery of the United States.\u201dThe TMC newsletter has moved!

An open secret in universities is that international students pay more than their classmates to study in the United States, effectively subsidizing education for U.S. students. Here\u2019s an example: In four-year public institutions, the average international student pays almost three times the in-state tuition amount.In an era of state budget cuts to higher education \u2014 not to mention the uncertainties of fall enrollments clouded by the coronavirus \u2014 the boost from international students is especially important. According to the Department of Commerce, international students contributed almost $45 billion to U.S. GDP in 2018, and helped create or support over 450,000 U.S. jobs.ADADThis fall offers an uncertain road for millions of students, workers and employers whose lives have been disrupted by the covid-19 pandemic. But the track record of U.S. universities, businesses and economic innovation suggests foreign-born students, teachers, doctors and Nobel laureates would continue to contribute to the route forward.Bruce Peabody is professor of government and politics at Fairleigh Dickinson University and the co-author of a forthcoming book on the political theory of death.Harvey Lodish is a founding member of the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research and professor of biology and biological engineering at MIT.", "comment": "26 Comments", "topic": "Monkey Cage"}, {"cover": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/MSSRV5GFEEI6VMBX7FYR7CPOIY.jpghttps://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/MSSRV5GFEEI6VMBX7FYR7CPOIY.jpg", "title": "The best science fiction and fantasy of the year so far \u2014 plus what we\u2019re looking forward to next", "date": "Jul 14, 2020", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/the-best-science-fiction-and-fantasy-of-the-year-so-far--plus-what-were-looking-forward-to-next/2020/07/14/0e58eb92-9c2e-11ea-ad09-8da7ec214672_story.html", "keyword": "China and the world order", "website": "the Washington Post", "author": "", "content": "(Tor.com)(Gallery/Saga Press)As we stumble our way into the middle of the year, publishing is in flux, with numerous books postponed and publication dates moving unpredictably.

But it\u2019s easy to miss so much stuff. One under-the-radar title is \u201cBeneath the Rising,\u201d by Premee Mohamed. Two 20-something best friends battle Lovecraftian horrors in this debut novel. Think Indiana Jones with cosmic horror. For fans of Asian period dramas I recommend \u201cThe Empress of Salt and Fortune,\u201d by Nghi Vo, a subtle, fable-like narrative set against a lush background of courtly intrigue.One excellent historical fantasy is \u201cConjure Women,\u201d by Afia Atakora, a multigenerational family saga about black women who have healing powers and their struggles and triumphs during the Civil War. Anything new in science fiction, Lavie?ADADLavie: Hao Jingfang\u2019s \u201cVagabonds,\u201d translated from Chinese by Ken Liu, is the first novel in English from the first Chinese woman to win the Hugo Award. It\u2019s the ambitious tale of a group of young people caught between Earth and Mars and the two worlds\u2019 wildly differing ideologies. British author Paul McCauley explores a vast artificial world in the far-future setting of \u201cWar of the Maps\u201d where a man must hunt an escaped criminal as a strange virus mutates the world around him. And Zen Cho\u2019s latest fantasy offering is the delightful \u201cThe Order of the Pure Moon Reflected in Water,\u201d about a nun joining a group of bandits on the run. In somewhat the same vein, Stark Holborn (the pen name of a writer better known for historical and romance novels) recently released \u201cTriggernometry,\u201d a Weird West story about a group of renegade mathematicians on a heist, in a world where math is a crime. And Botswana author Tlotlo Tsamaase made her debut with the enchanting \u201cThe Silence of the Wilting Skin,\u201d an ambitious, surrealist work that deserves notice.Sign up for the Book Club newsletterOne book I\u2019ve been hugely excited about is Tim Powers\u2019s latest, \u201cForced Perspectives,\u201d set in the magical underbelly of modern-day Los Angeles. Powers may be the master of the secret history novel (and one of the originators of steampunk), but his recent work has really explored the history and magic of Tinseltown in a way no one else can.As you can see, I\u2019ve been steering clear of any post-apocalyptic dystopias for some reason \u2014 I can\u2019t imagine why!ADADSilvia: Looking at horror, \u201cThe Unsuitable\u201d by Molly Pohlig blends body horror with Gothic fiction; and Kathe Koja, author of grungy, Weird fiction classic \u201cThe Cipher,\u201d has released a second short story collection, \u201cVelocities.\u201d \u201cThe Only Good Indians,\u201d by Stephen Graham Jones, was originally scheduled for May but was bumped to July. It\u2019s a great novel for fans of Peter Straub\u2019s \u201cGhost Story\u201d or Stephen King\u2019s work. It has the feel of classic horror but brings a fresh twist. Another interesting title out this month is \u201cThe Year of the Witching,\u201d by Alexis Henderson. This also has a classic setup but updates the olde puritanical tale to deal with issues of racism and sexism.And then, if dates don\u2019t change again (this keeps happening!), \u201cRing Shout\u201d by P. Dj\u00e8l\u00ed Clark should be out in the autumn. This novella has D.W. Griffith, director of the ultra racist silent flick \u201cThe Birth of a Nation,\u201d as a sorcerer who plans to unleash hell on Earth. That will also be release time for Rebecca Roanhorse\u2019s \u201cBlack Sun,\u201d a new fantasy series inspired by pre-Columbian cultures. Anything else that people should be penciling down?Lavie: \u201cThe Best of Jeffrey Ford\u201d came out recently, the definitive collection by this modern master of the fantastical short story. It\u2019s worth it for \u201cDaltharee\u201d alone, a story I adore, about a strange city in a bottle. Looking ahead, one title that should have people excited is Susanna Clarke\u2019s first new novel in a decade, \u201cPiranesi.\u201d Rather than a follow-up to her marvelous \u201cJonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell,\u201d it is a new fantasy world set in a strange infinite house. One book I love dearly is James Stoddard\u2019s \u201cThe High House,\u201d which has the same premise, so readers who have to wait for the new Clarke will do well to check it out in the meantime.More book reviews and recommendationsComing later in the year, too, is the debut fantasy by Icelandic author Alexander Dan Vilhj\u00e1lmsson, \u201cShadows of the Short Days,\u201d set in a magical Reykjavik, with echoes of China Mi\u00e9ville and the New Weird. I believe it\u2019s the first Icelandic fantasy novel to come out in English, and was translated from Icelandic by the author.\n\n", "comment": "32 Comments", "topic": "Books"}, {"cover": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/2YRLUGF6HYI6VF6BNTYRN77CNQ.jpghttps://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/2YRLUGF6HYI6VF6BNTYRN77CNQ.jpg", "title": "The Health 202: The coronavirus death rate is likely to rise again as cases spike, experts say", "date": "Jul 6, 2020", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/the-health-202/2020/07/06/the-health-202-the-coronavirus-death-rate-is-likely-to-rise-again-as-cases-spike-experts-say/5f01b89c88e0fa7b44f6de88/", "keyword": "China and the world order", "website": "the Washington Post", "author": "Paige Winfield Cunningham", "content": "with Paulina FiroziPresident Trump has seized on a bit of positive news as coronavirus cases surge in new hot spots across the country: The country's deaths are still going down.\u00a0Support our journalism. Subscribe today.arrow-rightIt's true that even as cases spike in western and southern states, deaths haven\u2019t followed the same steep, upward curve \u2014 at least so far. Deaths are still on a downward trajectory; while as many as 3,000 people died daily from the illness in April, that figure has fallen to around 550 deaths per day.\u201cDeaths and the all important Mortality Rate goes down,\u201d he pronounced in a pair of otherwise misleading tweets over the weekend:But coronavirus deaths are almost certain to rise. The key question is how quickly.\u00a0\u201cI do expect to see an increase in deaths in the coming weeks,\u201d Lauren Ancel Meyers, a professor of biology at the University of Texas, told me. \u201cExactly how many more is uncertain, but unfortunately that is what we expect at this point.\u201d\u00a0ADADPresident Trump's former Food and Drug Administration chief Scott Gottlieb said on CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation\u201d that \u201cthe total number of deaths is going to start going up again as the number of hospitalizations starts to spike again.\u201d\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re going to have more deaths, tragically,\" he said.Epidemiologists say there are several potential reasons for why the death rate is trailing infections.\u00a0Infections appear to be spreading fastest among younger people as they start mingling more.Younger Americans are far less prone to serious illness or death than elderly Americans, so it\u2019s feasible that as the virus burns through this population, it may cause proportionally fewer hospitalizations and fatalities.ADIn Arizona, around 40 percent of known cases were among people younger than 44 at the beginning of May but that\u2019s now up to 60 percent of all cases. Florida officials have said people ages 18 to 44 are primarily responsible for the state\u2019s recent spike in cases. And in Texas, more than half of new cases in the counties that encompass Austin, Dallas, Houston and San Antonio are among the young.\u00a0And as testing becomes even more widespread \u2014 between 600,000 and 700,000 tests are now being conducted in the United States every day \u2014 more people with only mild cases of covid-19 or no symptoms at all are being included in the testing tallies.Deaths also lag behind infections by three or four weeks.Patients seriously ill with covid-19 generally don\u2019t die until weeks into their illness. So, as infections and hospitalizations surge in states including Arizona, California, Texas and Florida, deaths will follow.ADAD\u201cWe know death is a lagging indicator,\u201d said Abraar Karan, a physician at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital. \u201cYou have cases show up first, hospitalizations next and deaths show up after that.\u201d\u00a0It\u2019s been clear for more than a month that infections are rising rapidly. Hospitalizations in most of these states are also climbing; over the weekend, coronavirus-related hospitalizations rose to their highest levels to date in Arizona and Nevada.There are emerging signs that deaths are already trending upward in some states.Compared to two weeks ago, the seven-day average of daily deaths is up nearly 50 percent in Florida and 54 percent in Arizona, according to the tracking website 91-DIVOC, which pulls data from Johns Hopkins University. The statewide death rate in both California and Texas is still holding steady, but some hospitals in both states have reported they\u2019re nearing capacity in intensive care units.ADAD\u201cAfter Texas reported another single-day record for new coronavirus cases over the weekend, Austin Mayor Steve Adler (D) told CNN\u2019s \u2018State of the Union\u2019 that there won\u2019t be enough medical personnel to keep up with the spike in cases if the rate of increase continues unabated in his city,\u201d Robert Barnes and Derek Hawkins report.\u201cIf we don\u2019t change this trajectory, then I am within two weeks of having our hospitals overrun,\u201d Adler said, noting that the city's intensive care units could be overflowing within 10 days.There's some good news: Doctors have figured out better ways of treating covid-19 patients.Experts say this could be a small factor in lower death rates.ADPhysicians have come a long way in developing a standardized way of caring for covid-19 patients, compared to the pandemic\u2019s outset. They\u2019ve learned \u2014 and research has confirmed \u2014 that dexamethasone cuts the risk of death for patients on a ventilator by a third and reduces the risk of death for patients on oxygen by a fifth.ADAnother drug, remdesivir, has been shown to speed up hospital recoveries by four days, but didn\u2019t have a statistically significant impact on survival rates. Doctors have also discovered that putting severely ill patients in a prone position improves the flow of oxygen to their lungs.\u00a0And then there\u2019s plasma transfusion, where patients are given blood plasma from people who recovered. Those who have recovered from an infection have virus-fighting antibodies floating in their blood that can help the immune systems of recipients fight off an infection.Former and current government officials issued dire warnings yesterday.Gottlieb also had this dire prediction about the country's political leadership, per a \u201cFace the Nation\u201d producer:Tom Bossert, former homeland security advisor to Trump, had this to say:By the time deaths go up again, it could be too late to turn the trend around with more drastic restrictions.\u00a0New coronavirus infections in Florida, for instance, exceeded 10,000 in a day for the third time in the past week, after the state posted a record of 11,458 the previous day. \u201cThe new infections pushed the state\u2019s total caseload past 200,000, a mark passed by just two other states, New York and California,\u201d Robert and Derek write.ADAD\u201cFrustration about the pandemic response has mounted among local leaders, who say they have had to grapple with conflicting orders and frequently changing guidelines from governors and the White House as they try to curb sharply rising infections,\u201d Derek and Marisa Iati report.\u201cWe don\u2019t have room to experiment; we don\u2019t have room for incrementalism when we\u2019re seeing these kinds of numbers,\u201d said Judge Lina Hidalgo (D), the top elected official in Harris County, Tex., which encompasses the sprawling Houston metro area. \u201cNor should we wait for all the hospital beds to fill and all these people to die before we take drastic action.\u201dAhh, oof and ouchAHH: Scientists are using a new method of vaccine development based on deploying RNA to trigger the immune system.\u00a0This cutting-edge approach, not previously used in vaccine development, is showing promise. Developers in Britain, Germany, China and the United States plan to have tens of millions of doses ready by the end of the year,\u201d William Booth and Carolyn Y. Johnson report.\u00a0\u201cElegant in theory, efficacious in the laboratory but untested in the real world, the possible RNA vaccines are especially attractive because they might be cheaper, easier and faster to manufacture on a massive scale \u2014 at least one team boasts it could partner with producers in developing countries to provide millions of vials for as little as $5 a pop.\u201d\u00a0RNA vaccines could mean smaller, more potent doses. But questions do remain about the safety and long-term efficacy of RNA technology.ADADDrugmakers, academic groups and government labs are working on more than 150 vaccine candidates, most using traditional vaccine approaches. But out of 17 teams that have moved into the human testing phase of their potential vaccines, at least five are working toward RNA vaccines.\u00a0\u201cThe RNA vaccines under study come from a small laboratory at Imperial College London, from the People\u2019s Liberation Army Academy of Military Sciences in China, from three large pharmaceutical companies \u2014 Pfizer, Moderna and CureVac \u2014 and their partners,\u201d Will and Carolyn write.\u00a0\u201cThough never deployed in humans outside of clinical trials, the RNA research is being backed by hundreds of millions of dollars in investment, fueled by the urgency to crack the covid code,\u201d they add. \"Each team is seeking the prize of being first to a vaccine, while guaranteeing their own populations will get early access.\u201d\u00a0OOF: Officials and public health experts disputed Trump's assertion that 99 percent of coronavirus cases are \u201ctotally harmless.\u201d\u00a0\u201cNow we have tested almost 40 million people \u2026 by so doing, we show cases 99 percent of which are totally harmless,\u201d Trump said during his Saturday remarks at the White House.\u00a0ADADAsked during an interview on CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation\u201d about the president\u2019s remarks, Gottlieb said he wasn\u2019t \u201creally sure what he\u2019s referring to,\u201d and suggested Trump could be referring to the number of infected people who need to be hospitalized.\u201cBut certainly more than 1 percent of people get serious illness from this,\u201d Gottlieb said. \u201cAbout 60 percent of people who get infected become symptomatic, about 10 to 15 percent of them will develop some form of covid pneumonia and somewhere around 2 to 5 percent of them will become hospitalized, depending on what the age mix is of the people who are getting infected. So this is still a pretty bad virus.\u201d\u00a0On numerous shows, FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn dodged questions about the president\u2019s comments. \u201cWell, let\u2019s talk about where we are right now. We\u2019re seeing cases around the Sun Belt,\u201d Hahn said when asked about the accuracy of the president\u2019s remarks on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201d \"We are certainly concerned, at the White House corona task force, about this \u2026 We\u2019ve sent teams into those states to actually help with taking care of the patients who are now with Covid-19.\u201dADAsked again, he said: \u201cYou know, any case, we don\u2019t want to have in this country. This is a very rapidly moving epidemic, rapidly moving pandemic. And any death, any case is tragic.\u201d\u00a0Asked on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d about Trump\u2019s remarks, Hahn said: \u201cI\u2019m not going to get into who is right and who is wrong\u2026 We have seen the surge in cases. We must do something to stem the tide.\u201dOUCH: There is growing evidence the virus can spread through the air.More than 200 scientists from more than 30\u00a0countries will publish a paper outlining growing evidence of the potential that the coronavirus can spread via airborne transmission. The Post's James McAuley and Emily Rauhala report. The signatories want the World Health Organization to take the possibility seriously,\u00a0\u201cUntil recently, most public health guidelines have focused on social distancing measures, regular hand-washing and precautions to avoid droplets. But the signatories to the paper say the potential of the virus to spread via airborne transmission has not been fully appreciated even by public health institutions such as the WHO,\u201d they write. \u201cThe fact that scientists resorted to a paper to pressure the WHO is unusual, analysts said, and is likely to renew questions about the WHO\u2019s messaging.\u201d\u201cThe paper, which was shared with The Washington Post ahead of publication this week in the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases, comes as the WHO faces criticism over its coronavirus response, calls for reform and a U.S. threat to cut funding and withdraw completely,\u201d they add.In the statesMost U.S. states haven\u2019t publicized details of whether their contact tracing efforts are working.Contact tracing, the process of contacting individuals who have potentially been exposed to the coronavirus and persuading them to quarantine, has been touted by experts as a key to controlling the pandemic.\u00a0\u201cBut most places across the United States aren\u2019t making public how fast or well they\u2019re running it, leaving Americans in the dark about how their governments are mitigating the risk,\u201d Steve Thompson reports.\u00a0D.C. has published contact tracing efforts on an online dashboard. The city built up a staff of several hundred contact tracers and officials say they are seeking to contact those who test positive within 24 hours of a positive test in about 98 percent of cases. Oregon also posts regular data about contact tracing, and New York officials say they plan to do the same soon.\u00a0The District\u2019s dashboard also indicates it will soon publish metrics on the percentage of new cases that are people who tracers have already contacted and who have quarantined because they were in contact with an infected person. That would be a sign of success for a contact-tracing program.As states see a spike in coronavirus cases, the surges will hinder contact tracing efforts. That will be true in places including Texas, Arizona, Nevada, South Carolina, West Virginia, Georgia and California, Steve writes.\u201cBut even states seeing declines are finding it hard to measure their success in contact tracing, in part because the effort is often spearheaded by local and county health departments,\u201d he adds. \u201c\u2026The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention posted guidance in April that included various recommended contact-tracing metrics \u2014 none of which are being publicly reported by most states.\u201d\u00a0The Trump administration's effortsVice President Pence has been zigzagging the country, visiting various hot spots where coronavirus cases are spiking.\u00a0It\u2019s an effort to signal that the administration is taking the resurgences seriously, even as the president appears to play down the ongoing pandemic, the Wall Street Journal\u2019s Andrew Restuccia reports.\u00a0Pence spent three hours in Florida on Thursday where he met the governor and local health experts, following similar visits to Arizona and Texas.\u201cAs cases surge around the country, the Trump administration has also once again put members of the White House\u2019s coronavirus task force in the spotlight after several weeks in which the panel was largely out of public view,\u201d Andrew writes. \"Three members of the task force\u2014White House coronavirus coordinator Dr. Deborah Birx, Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Stephen Hahn and Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar\u2014accompanied Mr. Pence on the trip.\u201d\u00a0Pence wore a mask during most of his visit late last week, a contrast with Trump, who has been reticent to wear one in public. Pence's mask-waring is a \u201cresponse to concerns among some in the administration that the White House was sending mixed messages about the importance of wearing a mask, advisers said,\u201d Andrew adds. Pence has pushed back against calls to mandate masks nationwide.The industry impactLow-skilled but essential health workers have been left out of the spotlight as people applaud doctors and nurses.\u00a0The Brookings Institution points to the millions of essential but undervalued and low-paid workers, such as orderlies, pharmacy aides, nursing assistants, as well as janitors and food preparation and serving workers who work in health-care settings. They often face the same risk as their higher-profile colleagues, \u201cbut sometimes with less access to protective gear, pay that can fall below a living wage and only a modicum of recognition,\u201d Justin Jouvenal reports.\u00a0\u201cWith a median wage of $13.58 an hour, some of the largely female and minority cadre of nearly 7 million across the country worry they are a serious case of covid-19 away from financial ruin,\" he writes.Lisa Brown, executive vice president of SEIU Local 1199 for the District and Maryland, said the union is not always informed when the workers fall ill. Brown said early in the pandemic, many workers who were not nurses or doctors were not a priority to get essential products, such as masks.\u00a0Justin adds: \u201cShe said most receive basic gear now, but there are still problems. At one Washington-area medical facility, she said, workers are sharing smocks from shift to shift. Other workers are forced to buy their own equipment if employers don\u2019t provide it.\u201d\u00a0Coronavirus latestAnd here are a few more stories to catch up on after the weekend:\u00a0The hardest hit:\u00a0The covid-19 death of a black man who was disabled underlines questions surrounding disability and race, and provides a glimpse into the fraught end-of-life decisions many are making during the pandemic, Ariana Eunjung Cha reports.Black and Latino residents across the country have been three times as likely to become infected as white residents, according to new CDC data obtained by the New York Times. Black and Latino people have also been nearly twice as likely to die of covid-19, compared with white people, according to the data.\u00a0More on the administration\u2019s response:\u00a0Two working papers point to ways the pandemic will lead to deep psychological scars long term in the United States, including a distrust of government institutions, Christopher Ingraham reports.More from the states:\u00a0After beginning June with no active coronavirus cases, the city of Joplin, Mo., is at the heart of one of the fastest-growing coronavirus hot spots in the country, Griff Witte reports. \u201cAnd like many places that skipped the springtime surge only to be walloped this summer, it\u2019s fighting back with a much-diminished arsenal,\u201d he adds, noting Missouri\u2019s lifted stay-at-home order is not likely to be restored.Curbing the pandemic:\u00a0Temperature checks are being deployed to identify people who may be infected with the coronavirus. But it\u2019s an imperfect system, since many contagious people have no symptoms. Some experts are suggesting that adding on smell tests could work well to better identify infected people, because the loss of sense of smell has been identified as an earlier symptom of the coronavirus, Stat News\u2019s Sharon Begley reports.Good to know:More covid-19 patients are surviving after being placed on ventilators. After reports early in the pandemic indicated that a majority of patients who required ventilators eventually died, since the pandemic has continued U.S. hospitals are \u201creporting much lower mortality rates, results on par with death rates for patients with similar severe lung problems caused by other diseases,\u201d Lenny Bernstein reports.Sugar rush", "comment": "58 Comments", "topic": "PowerPost"}, {"cover": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/GI4MZIV7P4I6VCIINCRLT2XJ4A.jpghttps://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/GI4MZIV7P4I6VCIINCRLT2XJ4A.jpg", "title": "The Health 202: The coronavirus death rate is likely to rise again as cases spike, experts say", "date": "Jul 6, 2020", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/the-health-202-the-coronavirus-death-rate-is-likely-to-rise-again-as-cases-spike-experts-say/2020/07/06/96496d80-c40d-4636-9dd1-72c95fadc415_story.html", "keyword": "China and the world order", "website": "the Washington Post", "author": "Paige Winfield Cunningham", "content": "with Paulina FiroziPresident Trump has seized on a bit of positive news as coronavirus cases surge in new hot spots across the country: The country's deaths are still going down.\u00a0Support our journalism.

And in Texas, more than half of new cases in the counties that encompass Austin, Dallas, Houston and San Antonio are among the young.\u00a0And as testing becomes even more widespread \u2014 between 600,000 and 700,000 tests are now being conducted in the United States every day \u2014 more people with only mild cases of covid-19 or no symptoms at all are being included in the testing tallies.Deaths also lag behind infections by three or four weeks.Patients seriously ill with covid-19 generally don\u2019t die until weeks into their illness. So, as infections and hospitalizations surge in states including Arizona, California, Texas and Florida, deaths will follow.ADAD\u201cWe know death is a lagging indicator,\u201d said Abraar Karan, a physician at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital. \u201cYou have cases show up first, hospitalizations next and deaths show up after that.\u201d\u00a0It\u2019s been clear for more than a month that infections are rising rapidly. Hospitalizations in most of these states are also climbing; over the weekend, coronavirus-related hospitalizations rose to their highest levels to date in Arizona and Nevada.There are emerging signs that deaths are already trending upward in some states.Compared to two weeks ago, the seven-day average of daily deaths is up nearly 50 percent in Florida and 54 percent in Arizona, according to the tracking website 91-DIVOC, which pulls data from Johns Hopkins University. The statewide death rate in both California and Texas is still holding steady, but some hospitals in both states have reported they\u2019re nearing capacity in intensive care units.ADAD\u201cAfter Texas reported another single-day record for new coronavirus cases over the weekend, Austin Mayor Steve Adler (D) told CNN\u2019s \u2018State of the Union\u2019 that there won\u2019t be enough medical personnel to keep up with the spike in cases if the rate of increase continues unabated in his city,\u201d Robert Barnes and Derek Hawkins report.\u201cIf we don\u2019t change this trajectory, then I am within two weeks of having our hospitals overrun,\u201d Adler said, noting that the city's intensive care units could be overflowing within 10 days.There's some good news: Doctors have figured out better ways of treating covid-19 patients.Experts say this could be a small factor in lower death rates.ADPhysicians have come a long way in developing a standardized way of caring for covid-19 patients, compared to the pandemic\u2019s outset. They\u2019ve learned \u2014 and research has confirmed \u2014 that dexamethasone cuts the risk of death for patients on a ventilator by a third and reduces the risk of death for patients on oxygen by a fifth.ADAnother drug, remdesivir, has been shown to speed up hospital recoveries by four days, but didn\u2019t have a statistically significant impact on survival rates. Doctors have also discovered that putting severely ill patients in a prone position improves the flow of oxygen to their lungs.\u00a0And then there\u2019s plasma transfusion, where patients are given blood plasma from people who recovered. Those who have recovered from an infection have virus-fighting antibodies floating in their blood that can help the immune systems of recipients fight off an infection.Former and current government officials issued dire warnings yesterday.Gottlieb also had this dire prediction about the country's political leadership, per a \u201cFace the Nation\u201d producer:Tom Bossert, former homeland security advisor to Trump, had this to say:By the time deaths go up again, it could be too late to turn the trend around with more drastic restrictions.\u00a0New coronavirus infections in Florida, for instance, exceeded 10,000 in a day for the third time in the past week, after the state posted a record of 11,458 the previous day. \u201cThe new infections pushed the state\u2019s total caseload past 200,000, a mark passed by just two other states, New York and California,\u201d Robert and Derek write.ADAD\u201cFrustration about the pandemic response has mounted among local leaders, who say they have had to grapple with conflicting orders and frequently changing guidelines from governors and the White House as they try to curb sharply rising infections,\u201d Derek and Marisa Iati report.\u201cWe don\u2019t have room to experiment; we don\u2019t have room for incrementalism when we\u2019re seeing these kinds of numbers,\u201d said Judge Lina Hidalgo (D), the top elected official in Harris County, Tex., which encompasses the sprawling Houston metro area. \u201cNor should we wait for all the hospital beds to fill and all these people to die before we take drastic action.\u201dAhh, oof and ouchAHH: Scientists are using a new method of vaccine development based on deploying RNA to trigger the immune system.\u00a0This cutting-edge approach, not previously used in vaccine development, is showing promise. Developers in Britain, Germany, China and the United States plan to have tens of millions of doses ready by the end of the year,\u201d William Booth and Carolyn Y. Johnson report.\u00a0\u201cElegant in theory, efficacious in the laboratory but untested in the real world, the possible RNA vaccines are especially attractive because they might be cheaper, easier and faster to manufacture on a massive scale \u2014 at least one team boasts it could partner with producers in developing countries to provide millions of vials for as little as $5 a pop.\u201d\u00a0RNA vaccines could mean smaller, more potent doses. But questions do remain about the safety and long-term efficacy of RNA technology.ADADDrugmakers, academic groups and government labs are working on more than 150 vaccine candidates, most using traditional vaccine approaches. But out of 17 teams that have moved into the human testing phase of their potential vaccines, at least five are working toward RNA vaccines.\u00a0\u201cThe RNA vaccines under study come from a small laboratory at Imperial College London, from the People\u2019s Liberation Army Academy of Military Sciences in China, from three large pharmaceutical companies \u2014 Pfizer, Moderna and CureVac \u2014 and their partners,\u201d Will and Carolyn write.\u00a0\u201cThough never deployed in humans outside of clinical trials, the RNA research is being backed by hundreds of millions of dollars in investment, fueled by the urgency to crack the covid code,\u201d they add. \"Each team is seeking the prize of being first to a vaccine, while guaranteeing their own populations will get early access.\u201d\u00a0OOF: Officials and public health experts disputed Trump's assertion that 99 percent of coronavirus cases are \u201ctotally harmless.\u201d\u00a0\u201cNow we have tested almost 40 million people \u2026 by so doing, we show cases 99 percent of which are totally harmless,\u201d Trump said during his Saturday remarks at the White House.\u00a0ADADAsked during an interview on CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation\u201d about the president\u2019s remarks, Gottlieb said he wasn\u2019t \u201creally sure what he\u2019s referring to,\u201d and suggested Trump could be referring to the number of infected people who need to be hospitalized.\u201cBut certainly more than 1 percent of people get serious illness from this,\u201d Gottlieb said. \u201cAbout 60 percent of people who get infected become symptomatic, about 10 to 15 percent of them will develop some form of covid pneumonia and somewhere around 2 to 5 percent of them will become hospitalized, depending on what the age mix is of the people who are getting infected. So this is still a pretty bad virus.\u201d\u00a0On numerous shows, FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn dodged questions about the president\u2019s comments. \u201cWell, let\u2019s talk about where we are right now. We\u2019re seeing cases around the Sun Belt,\u201d Hahn said when asked about the accuracy of the president\u2019s remarks on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201d \"We are certainly concerned, at the White House corona task force, about this \u2026 We\u2019ve sent teams into those states to actually help with taking care of the patients who are now with Covid-19.\u201dADAsked again, he said: \u201cYou know, any case, we don\u2019t want to have in this country. This is a very rapidly moving epidemic, rapidly moving pandemic. And any death, any case is tragic.\u201d\u00a0Asked on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d about Trump\u2019s remarks, Hahn said: \u201cI\u2019m not going to get into who is right and who is wrong\u2026 We have seen the surge in cases. We must do something to stem the tide.\u201dOUCH: There is growing evidence the virus can spread through the air.More than 200 scientists from more than 30\u00a0countries will publish a paper outlining growing evidence of the potential that the coronavirus can spread via airborne transmission. The Post's James McAuley and Emily Rauhala report. The signatories want the World Health Organization to take the possibility seriously,\u00a0\u201cUntil recently, most public health guidelines have focused on social distancing measures, regular hand-washing and precautions to avoid droplets. But the signatories to the paper say the potential of the virus to spread via airborne transmission has not been fully appreciated even by public health institutions such as the WHO,\u201d they write. \u201cThe fact that scientists resorted to a paper to pressure the WHO is unusual, analysts said, and is likely to renew questions about the WHO\u2019s messaging.\u201d\u201cThe paper, which was shared with The Washington Post ahead of publication this week in the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases, comes as the WHO faces criticism over its coronavirus response, calls for reform and a U.S. threat to cut funding and withdraw completely,\u201d they add.In the statesMost U.S. states haven\u2019t publicized details of whether their contact tracing efforts are working.Contact tracing, the process of contacting individuals who have potentially been exposed to the coronavirus and persuading them to quarantine, has been touted by experts as a key to controlling the pandemic.\u00a0\u201cBut most places across the United States aren\u2019t making public how fast or well they\u2019re running it, leaving Americans in the dark about how their governments are mitigating the risk,\u201d Steve Thompson reports.\u00a0D.C. has published contact tracing efforts on an online dashboard. The city built up a staff of several hundred contact tracers and officials say they are seeking to contact those who test positive within 24 hours of a positive test in about 98 percent of cases. Oregon also posts regular data about contact tracing, and New York officials say they plan to do the same soon.\u00a0The District\u2019s dashboard also indicates it will soon publish metrics on the percentage of new cases that are people who tracers have already contacted and who have quarantined because they were in contact with an infected person. That would be a sign of success for a contact-tracing program.As states see a spike in coronavirus cases, the surges will hinder contact tracing efforts. That will be true in places including Texas, Arizona, Nevada, South Carolina, West Virginia, Georgia and California, Steve writes.\u201cBut even states seeing declines are finding it hard to measure their success in contact tracing, in part because the effort is often spearheaded by local and county health departments,\u201d he adds. \u201c\u2026The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention posted guidance in April that included various recommended contact-tracing metrics \u2014 none of which are being publicly reported by most states.\u201d\u00a0The Trump administration's effortsVice President Pence has been zigzagging the country, visiting various hot spots where coronavirus cases are spiking.\u00a0It\u2019s an effort to signal that the administration is taking the resurgences seriously, even as the president appears to play down the ongoing pandemic, the Wall Street Journal\u2019s Andrew Restuccia reports.\u00a0Pence spent three hours in Florida on Thursday where he met the governor and local health experts, following similar visits to Arizona and Texas.\u201cAs cases surge around the country, the Trump administration has also once again put members of the White House\u2019s coronavirus task force in the spotlight after several weeks in which the panel was largely out of public view,\u201d Andrew writes. \"Three members of the task force\u2014White House coronavirus coordinator Dr. Deborah Birx, Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Stephen Hahn and Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar\u2014accompanied Mr. Pence on the trip.\u201d\u00a0Pence wore a mask during most of his visit late last week, a contrast with Trump, who has been reticent to wear one in public. Pence's mask-waring is a \u201cresponse to concerns among some in the administration that the White House was sending mixed messages about the importance of wearing a mask, advisers said,\u201d Andrew adds. Pence has pushed back against calls to mandate masks nationwide.The industry impactLow-skilled but essential health workers have been left out of the spotlight as people applaud doctors and nurses.\u00a0The Brookings Institution points to the millions of essential but undervalued and low-paid workers, such as orderlies, pharmacy aides, nursing assistants, as well as janitors and food preparation and serving workers who work in health-care settings. They often face the same risk as their higher-profile colleagues, \u201cbut sometimes with less access to protective gear, pay that can fall below a living wage and only a modicum of recognition,\u201d Justin Jouvenal reports.\u00a0\u201cWith a median wage of $13.58 an hour, some of the largely female and minority cadre of nearly 7 million across the country worry they are a serious case of covid-19 away from financial ruin,\" he writes.Lisa Brown, executive vice president of SEIU Local 1199 for the District and Maryland, said the union is not always informed when the workers fall ill. Brown said early in the pandemic, many workers who were not nurses or doctors were not a priority to get essential products, such as masks.\u00a0Justin adds: \u201cShe said most receive basic gear now, but there are still problems. At one Washington-area medical facility, she said, workers are sharing smocks from shift to shift. Other workers are forced to buy their own equipment if employers don\u2019t provide it.\u201d\u00a0Coronavirus latestAnd here are a few more stories to catch up on after the weekend:\u00a0The hardest hit:\u00a0The covid-19 death of a black man who was disabled underlines questions surrounding disability and race, and provides a glimpse into the fraught end-of-life decisions many are making during the pandemic, Ariana Eunjung Cha reports.Black and Latino residents across the country have been three times as likely to become infected as white residents, according to new CDC data obtained by the New York Times. Black and Latino people have also been nearly twice as likely to die of covid-19, compared with white people, according to the data.\u00a0More on the administration\u2019s response:\u00a0Two working papers point to ways the pandemic will lead to deep psychological scars long term in the United States, including a distrust of government institutions, Christopher Ingraham reports.More from the states:\u00a0After beginning June with no active coronavirus cases, the city of Joplin, Mo., is at the heart of one of the fastest-growing coronavirus hot spots in the country, Griff Witte reports. \u201cAnd like many places that skipped the springtime surge only to be walloped this summer, it\u2019s fighting back with a much-diminished arsenal,\u201d he adds, noting Missouri\u2019s lifted stay-at-home order is not likely to be restored.Curbing the pandemic:\u00a0Temperature checks are being deployed to identify people who may be infected with the coronavirus. But it\u2019s an imperfect system, since many contagious people have no symptoms. Some experts are suggesting that adding on smell tests could work well to better identify infected people, because the loss of sense of smell has been identified as an earlier symptom of the coronavirus, Stat News\u2019s Sharon Begley reports.Good to know:More covid-19 patients are surviving after being placed on ventilators. After reports early in the pandemic indicated that a majority of patients who required ventilators eventually died, since the pandemic has continued U.S. hospitals are \u201creporting much lower mortality rates, results on par with death rates for patients with similar severe lung problems caused by other diseases,\u201d Lenny Bernstein reports.Sugar rush", "comment": "58 Comments", "topic": "PowerPost"}, {"cover": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/CMGNNTV4KEI6VF6BNTYRN77CNQ.jpghttps://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/CMGNNTV4KEI6VF6BNTYRN77CNQ.jpg", "title": "As Trump pressures schools to reopen, here\u2019s how other countries have handled the return to the classroom  ", "date": "Jul 8, 2020", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2020/06/05/coronavirus-countries-reopening-schools/", "keyword": "China and the world order", "website": "the Washington Post", "author": "Adam Taylor", "content": "Earlier this year, the spread of the novel coronavirus forced more than 1.5 billion students into hastily implemented experiments in learning from home as schools around the world shut their doors.More than half a year into the pandemic, a global experiment is underway that could prove even messier: the return to the classroom.Support our journalism. Subscribe today.arrow-rightPresident Trump this week applied mounting pressure on state and local authorities to have schools resume in-person classes in the fall, although many experts and officials say it would not yet be safe, as case numbers remain high in much of the country.In a tweet Wednesday, Trump suggested that other countries, including Germany, Denmark, Norway and Sweden, had opened schools safely.Though some students around the world did begin to return to the classroom in May, more than 1 billion remain affected by school closures, according to data compiled by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization.Though he has been vocal, Trump has limited say in when schools reopen, and few countries that have sent students back to school in person have outbreaks that match the scope of the one in the United States.ADADBut many countries are moving forward with reopening, as debates unfold about how to weigh disruptions to a child\u2019s education and the costs of child care for those returning to work against health risks.Many countries hope to resume in-person classes in the fallSome nations have reopened their schools already, citing evidence that their outbreaks are under control.Many have issued new safety requirements. At the epicenter of the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, schools reopened in early May, but children had to pass through temperature checks, wear masks, and enter and leave at specific times to avoid crowding.Denmark, one of the countries cited by Trump, closed its schools on March 11. Just a month later, it became the first country in Europe to reopen them, with almost all primary schools operating by April 20. In Sweden, classes continued uninterrupted for children under the age of 16.ADADIn many nations, the vast majority of students are expected to be back for in-person classes when the new school year begins in late summer. Belgium, Britain, France and Italy are all pushing for plans to reopen schools widely in September.Germany\u2019s federal education ministries reached an agreement in June that should see students return for the new school year, with a required five-foot minimum distance between students in classrooms, the rule that made it impossible for classes to resume at full capacity before summer vacations.Most of these nations are not seeing a surge in cases like the United States is. But Russia, which has the fourth largest number of cases in the world, announced on June 29 that schools in the country would open their doors on Sept. 1 as usual.Some countries remain undecided Many other nations are unsure whether they will reopen schools anytime soon. In India, home to the third largest number of coronavirus cases in the world, students are already back from their summer break, but schools remain closed. Students will likely return to the classroom at different times, state by state.ADADBrazil, which has the second largest number of coronavirus cases in the world, is taking a similar patchwork approach. Some private schools reopened this month, and the country, which has no education minister at present, appears to be allowing local governments to call the shots.In Israel, as new cases surge again, the central government appears to be delaying any decision on reopening in September. And in Kenya, schools are not expected to reopen until early next year \u2014 the regularly scheduled start of the academic year in the country.No primary and secondary school examinations will be held this year and \u201cthe 2020 school calendar year will be considered lost due to covid-19 restrictions,\u201d Education Minister George Magoha told the BBC on Tuesday.Return to school does not mean return to normalcyThough the resumption of in-person schooling can help children\u2019s education remain on track and allow parents to work, it also presents many problems for how to limit the spread of the coronavirus.ADADSome schools have pushed forward by mandating safety equipment like face masks, sanitizer and desk shields, but not all countries have been able to implement these measures. Others have taken to limiting class sizes or staggering arrival times. Many have allowed only graduating classes to return to school at first.Risks remain, and some parents have refused to send their children back to school. In some countries, including South Africa, the fiercest opposition to school reopening comes from teachers, who argue that a crowded classroom would put them and their students at risk.Some countries where school reopened early have seen a new wave of local closures as cases resurge. After recording no new cases from April 30 to May 22, the Japanese city of Kitakyushu in Fukuoka prefecture recorded 119 confirmed cases in just 11 days \u2014 including 11 pupils from four elementary and junior high schools \u2014 prompting an order to re-close schools.ADADIn South Korea, an initial late-May reopening was delayed by a week after an outbreak in Seoul\u2019s nightlife district of Itaewon. And just days after the first students set foot back in the classroom, hundreds of schools were closed after a sudden spike in new cases.In China, Beijing authorities once again shuttered schools in mid-June during a new outbreak in the capital city.

Subscribe today.arrow-rightThat could be an electoral disaster for the president, who\u2019s locked in a difficult reelection race \u2014 especially if the coronavirus pandemic makes it difficult or risky for many of his supporters to vote in person.\u00a0The issue was already dividing Trump from Republican election officials who have generally joined Democrats in trying to vastly expand mail voting during the pandemic so people don't have to risk their health to cast ballots. Now it\u2019s splitting him from his own party\u2019s strategists.\u00a0ADADThe president\u2019s criticism of mail voting \u201cdoes reduce the likelihood of Republicans embracing this process,\u201d a senior GOP strategist told my colleagues. \u201cEspecially for older, more rural voters, that could be important for Republicans getting out the vote in 2020. I don\u2019t want \u2018I will not vote by mail\u2019 to become a political statement. But it may be too late.\u201d\u00a0The rift is especially noteworthy because voting by mail has not historically been a partisan issue. Many right-leaning states, such as Utah and Arizona, have embraced the process with large percentages of their populations casting mail ballots. Many left-leaning states, including Massachusetts and New York, have shied away from it.\u00a0The disparities between Republicans and Democrats are unmistakable.\u00a0About twice as many Virginia Democrats applied for absentee ballots compared to Republicans in the state\u2019s June 23 primaries. That\u2019s despite the fact Republicans had a competitive Senate primary to vote in while Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.) was running unopposed for his party\u2019s nomination.\u00a0ADADIn Kentucky\u2019s June 23 primary, about 90 percent of Democrats cast their ballots before Election Day, either by mail voting or early voting. Just 80 percent of Republicans did so.\u00a0In Georgia\u2019s June 9 primaries, about 60,000 fewer Republicans cast ballots by mail compared to Democrats despite a majority of Georgia voters traditionally voting Republican.\u00a0Republicans are also expressing widespread distrust of mail voting.\u00a0A Washington Post-ABC News poll\u00a0in late May found 87 percent of Democrats think it should be easier to vote by mail compared to just 33 percent of Republicans.\u00a0That\u2019s despite the fact that fraud risks from voting by mail are, in fact, exceptionally low.\u00a0ADThe few prominent cases have been easily discovered. That includes an effort launched by GOP operatives in North Carolina in 2018 and a recent case that led to criminal charges against members of the Paterson, N.J., city council. Council members there are elected on a nonpartisan basis.\u00a0A\u00a0Washington Post analysis\u00a0recently found possible voter fraud cases in states that vote primarily by mail accounted for just 0.0025 percent of ballots in 2016 and 2018 \u00a0\u2014 or about one out of every 39,000.\u00a0Republicans have also lashed out at their own representatives when they embraced voting by mail or urged them to cast ballots that way.\u00a0In one dramatic example, a Republican senator seeking reelection sent a mass text urging constituents to apply for absentee ballots. The senator got a reply saying, \u201cNo one should legitimize this mail-in voting hogwash,\u201d my colleagues report.\u00a0ADADSkepticism about mail voting was also on display in primaries yesterday in New Jersey.P. Kenneth Burns with Philadelphia\u2019s WHYY public radio station:\u00a0The New Jersey primary was held almost entirely by mail without any major problems. Results in some races could take a week or longer because of the high volume of absentee votes, but winners have already been declared in some high profile races. That includes former Vice President Joe Biden, who's already the party's presumptive nominee, winning the state's Democratic presidential primary.\u00a0Trump hasn\u2019t slowed his assaults \u2013 despite voting by mail himself in Florida this year.\u00a0In a June 2 tweet the president pointed to the Paterson case and claimed that \u201cMail-In Ballots will lead to massive electoral fraud and a rigged 2020 Election.\u201dThe president also regularly rants about mail ballots and voter fraud in the Oval Office, one former senior administration official told my colleagues, because \u201cone, he truly believes it, and two, it gives him an out if he loses.\u201dADADBiden, meanwhile, has urged states to expand mail voting and early voting during the pandemic. He voted by mail in Delaware\u2019s primary, which was also held yesterday and where he was also declared the winner.\u00a0NBC News\u2019s Mike Memoli:Even government health officials are carefully disputing the president\u2019s claims.\u00a0The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention quietly issued updated guidance June 22 urging voters to consider alternatives to in-person voting on Election Day including voting by mail, Michelle Ye Hee Lee reports.\u00a0The CDC circulated the updated guidance to election officials in June but didn\u2019t promote it publicly. It was shared more widely yesterday by Sens. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and Patty Murray (D-Wash.), who had urged the CDC to update its guidance.ADKlobuchar led a push by Senate Democrats to invest $3.6 billion in expanding mail voting and other reforms to ensure the November election is safe and secure. Those efforts have been blocked by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) who opposes federal mandates on elections.\u00a0AD\u201cIn the midst of this pandemic, voters should not need to choose between their health and casting their ballots,\u201d Klobuchar said. \u201cThis guidance from the CDC makes it clear that the government must take steps to protect voters.\u201dThe keysFBI Director Christopher A.

Subscribe today.arrow-rightThat could be an electoral disaster for the president, who\u2019s locked in a difficult reelection race \u2014 especially if the coronavirus pandemic makes it difficult or risky for many of his supporters to vote in person.\u00a0The issue was already dividing Trump from Republican election officials who have generally joined Democrats in trying to vastly expand mail voting during the pandemic so people don't have to risk their health to cast ballots. Now it\u2019s splitting him from his own party\u2019s strategists.\u00a0ADADThe president\u2019s criticism of mail voting \u201cdoes reduce the likelihood of Republicans embracing this process,\u201d a senior GOP strategist told my colleagues. \u201cEspecially for older, more rural voters, that could be important for Republicans getting out the vote in 2020. I don\u2019t want \u2018I will not vote by mail\u2019 to become a political statement. But it may be too late.\u201d\u00a0The rift is especially noteworthy because voting by mail has not historically been a partisan issue. Many right-leaning states, such as Utah and Arizona, have embraced the process with large percentages of their populations casting mail ballots. Many left-leaning states, including Massachusetts and New York, have shied away from it.\u00a0The disparities between Republicans and Democrats are unmistakable.\u00a0About twice as many Virginia Democrats applied for absentee ballots compared to Republicans in the state\u2019s June 23 primaries. That\u2019s despite the fact Republicans had a competitive Senate primary to vote in while Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.) was running unopposed for his party\u2019s nomination.\u00a0ADADIn Kentucky\u2019s June 23 primary, about 90 percent of Democrats cast their ballots before Election Day, either by mail voting or early voting. Just 80 percent of Republicans did so.\u00a0In Georgia\u2019s June 9 primaries, about 60,000 fewer Republicans cast ballots by mail compared to Democrats despite a majority of Georgia voters traditionally voting Republican.\u00a0Republicans are also expressing widespread distrust of mail voting.\u00a0A Washington Post-ABC News poll\u00a0in late May found 87 percent of Democrats think it should be easier to vote by mail compared to just 33 percent of Republicans.\u00a0That\u2019s despite the fact that fraud risks from voting by mail are, in fact, exceptionally low.\u00a0ADThe few prominent cases have been easily discovered. That includes an effort launched by GOP operatives in North Carolina in 2018 and a recent case that led to criminal charges against members of the Paterson, N.J., city council. Council members there are elected on a nonpartisan basis.\u00a0A\u00a0Washington Post analysis\u00a0recently found possible voter fraud cases in states that vote primarily by mail accounted for just 0.0025 percent of ballots in 2016 and 2018 \u00a0\u2014 or about one out of every 39,000.\u00a0Republicans have also lashed out at their own representatives when they embraced voting by mail or urged them to cast ballots that way.\u00a0In one dramatic example, a Republican senator seeking reelection sent a mass text urging constituents to apply for absentee ballots. The senator got a reply saying, \u201cNo one should legitimize this mail-in voting hogwash,\u201d my colleagues report.\u00a0ADADSkepticism about mail voting was also on display in primaries yesterday in New Jersey.P. Kenneth Burns with Philadelphia\u2019s WHYY public radio station:\u00a0The New Jersey primary was held almost entirely by mail without any major problems. Results in some races could take a week or longer because of the high volume of absentee votes, but winners have already been declared in some high profile races. That includes former Vice President Joe Biden, who's already the party's presumptive nominee, winning the state's Democratic presidential primary.\u00a0Trump hasn\u2019t slowed his assaults \u2013 despite voting by mail himself in Florida this year.\u00a0In a June 2 tweet the president pointed to the Paterson case and claimed that \u201cMail-In Ballots will lead to massive electoral fraud and a rigged 2020 Election.\u201dThe president also regularly rants about mail ballots and voter fraud in the Oval Office, one former senior administration official told my colleagues, because \u201cone, he truly believes it, and two, it gives him an out if he loses.\u201dADADBiden, meanwhile, has urged states to expand mail voting and early voting during the pandemic. He voted by mail in Delaware\u2019s primary, which was also held yesterday and where he was also declared the winner.\u00a0NBC News\u2019s Mike Memoli:Even government health officials are carefully disputing the president\u2019s claims.\u00a0The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention quietly issued updated guidance June 22 urging voters to consider alternatives to in-person voting on Election Day including voting by mail, Michelle Ye Hee Lee reports.\u00a0The CDC circulated the updated guidance to election officials in June but didn\u2019t promote it publicly. It was shared more widely yesterday by Sens. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and Patty Murray (D-Wash.), who had urged the CDC to update its guidance.ADKlobuchar led a push by Senate Democrats to invest $3.6 billion in expanding mail voting and other reforms to ensure the November election is safe and secure. Those efforts have been blocked by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) who opposes federal mandates on elections.\u00a0AD\u201cIn the midst of this pandemic, voters should not need to choose between their health and casting their ballots,\u201d Klobuchar said. \u201cThis guidance from the CDC makes it clear that the government must take steps to protect voters.\u201dThe keysFBI Director Christopher A.

Subscribe today.arrow-rightOver the past five days, the United States has suffered a worsening resurgence of coronavirus cases indicating that \u2014 after six months \u2014 the most powerful country in the world has made little progress in controlling the virus and that Americans may indefinitely remain its prisoners.President Trump, meanwhile, has been largely MIA on a question most citizens expect their president to address: What does he plan to do now to better protect the public health and return the country to normalcy?ADThe American people heard little from their president over the weekend on the worrisome infections spreading throughout the South and West.ADFrom Thursday to today, Trump apparently preferred to spend his time on other things.\u00a0He wiped away the prison sentence of his convicted political adviser Roger Stone and golfed two days in a row at his Trump National Golf Club on the banks of the Potomac River. The president sent out dozens of tweets, including some that threatened 10-year prison sentences for protesters who defile federal monuments and statues, defended his border wall, and congratulated his Fox News booster Sean Hannity for a \u201cbig night\u201d of viewer ratings on Thursday night, when Trump was his guest.Trump has increasingly sidestepped responsibility for leading a coordinated federal response.\u00a0That behavior fits a pattern in Trump's presidency in which the president seemingly has no interest in or patience for what he considers the boring work of governing, several of his former senior advisers say, speaking on the condition of anonymity. He was not fully engaged for the hard work of defusing the pandemic, including listening to panels of experts, sifting through scientific models and making hard choices to craft a whole-of-government response, an option not seriously considered.Trump's attempts to contain the virus have always been tentative.In early spring, as his advisers pushed the reluctant president to deem the virus a public health emergency, Trump tried marketing, taking to the White House lectern almost daily to talk about the \u201cgreat\u201d job his administration was doing to tackle the disease, despite a botched testing launch that put the country way behind the curve in containment. \u00a0Trump still routinely pans testing as a \u201cdouble-edged sword,\u201d arguing it only increases the number of confirmed cases and makes his administration \u201clook bad,\u201d while \u00a0simultaneously vowing an imminent vaccine. He then tried saddling governors with the responsibility of tamping down the crisis, while calling to \u201cLIBERATE!\u201d states that wouldn't move to reopen quickly enough. Now, he is saying schools should move to fully reopen this fall despite major pushback from local officials and teachers unions.ADADThat\u2019s come into sharp relief again in the past five days, as the rate of coronavirus infections is setting records, suggesting \u00a0America is back to square one in this health crisis.\u00a0Coronavirus deaths are on the rise in every region of the country. As happened in early spring, the volume of new cases is rising so fast, particularly in the Sun Belt, that testing can\u2019t keep up. Receiving rapid test results, quarantining the sick and controlling the virus's spread is proving nearly impossible.\u00a0Several major school systems and colleges in California are retrenching on their plans to reopen this fall, and announced they will instead have online classes only for the time being. CEOs are preparing for employees to continue working remotely indefinitely after Labor Day, as well.\u00a0The worsening pandemic cries out for concrete steps from the federal government. But Trump has stubbornly sought to shift the blame for the situation and sees himself as the victim of an unfortunate convergence of circumstances.\u00a0Trump\u2019s most recent fall guy is Anthony S. Fauci.Though never entirely on the same page as his top infectious-disease specialist, the president appeared with Fauci at coronavirus task force briefings, and the two seemed to be communicating earlier in the crisis. But things have clearly changed between the two men, with Trump apparently viewing Fauci\u2019s grim message about burgeoning cases and the dangers of reopening as a threat. In the midst of the most perilous public health threat in a century, the president hasn\u2019t met with Fauci in over a month. The doctor slipped into the White House yesterday, however, to meet with Chief of Staff Mark Meadows as criticism of the administration's bashing of him intensified.In the past five days, as the news has grown more dire and Fauci has refused to sugarcoat it, Trump and his allies have sought to cast Fauci as\u00a0error-prone.ADADIn his Thursday interview with Hannity, Trump criticized Fauci as a nice guy who has nevertheless \u201cmade a lot of mistakes.\u201d By Monday, Trump\u2019s souring on the doctor\u00a0had become part of a larger concerted campaign within the White House. A senior White House official anonymously gave reporters opposition-research-style bullet points of comments Fauci made about the virus that were described as misleading or inaccurate. They included Fauci\u2019s early advice that people who didn\u2019t feel sick need not wear masks and should preserve the supply for medical workers, and Fauci typically cautioned the situation was evolving.The White House list doesn\u2019t mention Trump's repeated inaccurate and misleading comments about the virus and the government's response, including his claim the U.S. could reopen safely by Easter or his recommendation that people with covid-19 could get better by taking hydroxychloroquine or possibly by being treated with bleach or ultraviolet light. The list didn\u2019t mention when Trump in January insisted the coronavirus was \u201ctotally under control\u201d and would create only a few U.S. cases, or when he said the number of cases would \u201cgo down to zero.\u201d\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s going to disappear,\u201d Trump said Feb. 28. \u201cOne day it\u2019s like a miracle, it will disappear.\u201dADADThe campaign of presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden on Monday attacked Trump\u2019s effort to blame Fauci.\u201cOver 135,000 Americans have lost their lives and tens of millions have lost their jobs because Donald Trump spent the last six months disastrously mismanaging the worst public health crisis in a century, the whole time failing to heed the warnings and guidance of medical experts \u2014 particularly Dr. Fauci,\u201d Biden campaign spokesman Andrew Bates said.\u00a0So much of Trump\u2019s response is part of the playbook he deployed during the first three years of his presidency.\u00a0Trump finds governing tedious, several of his senior former advisers have said. He likes to make decisions on impulse, and later, if those decisions blow up in his face, he tends to blame others for making them.ADThough Trump repeatedly praised his defense secretary Jim Mattis as one of his best Cabinet picks ever, he later concluded the four-star general was \u201coverrated\u201d after he resigned in protest of Trump\u2019s decision to pull U.S. soldiers out of Syria. Trump made the decision on the fly during a phone call when Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan asked him to leave Syria. Mattis felt it was militarily unwise to exit the battlefield, which would just allow Islamic State factions to regain their strongholds. He also considered it unethical to leave America's Kurdish allies in danger, and inexplicable for Trump to grant this gift to Erdogan without any benefit to the United States.\u00a0ADWhen Trump was in Paris in November 2018 and didn\u2019t want to go to a sacred memorial to fallen American soldiers in World War II, he asked his chief of staff John Kelly and another aide for options. They said he could blame his absence on weather; it would be difficult to clear the streets for his motorcade at the last minute and potentially worrisome to fly by helicopter. But when Trump got terrible press for skipping the event, with some critics asking if he didn\u2019t want to get his hair wet,\u00a0Trump blamed Kelly, saying he should have talked him into attending.\u201cHe never apologizes,\u201d said one former senior adviser who left the Trump administration. \u201cIt\u2019s always somebody else\u2019s fault. He can\u2019t take responsibility for any decision.\u201d\u00a0ADThis March, Trump blamed the rules and regulations from the Obama administration for his administration\u2019s inability to test enough Americans for the virus to control its spread at a critical early stage. He didn\u2019t mention that he and his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, had feared that such rapid, emergency testing might be bad for the markets and the economy.AD\u201cI don't take responsibility at all,\u201d Trump said.Governing is boring, hard, uncertain. Blaming is infinitely easier.Quote of the day\u201cIt\u2019s shocking,\u201d said Janis Orlowski, chief health-care officer of the Association of American Medical Colleges and one of many academics and researchers who rallied to defend Fauci from White House attacks. \u201cWhen you begin to discredit scientists like Fauci, who are national treasures, you are in serious trouble.\u201d (Laurie McGinley and Yasmeen Abutaleb)More on the coronavirusThe White House will ask states to consider calling up the National Guard to help with data collection. \u00a0\u201cA letter, to be sent to governors imminently, backs away from earlier drafts as recently as Friday that had directed state leaders to deploy the National Guard to help hospitals with daily data submissions. It now includes the National Guard among states\u2019 options for improving the data flow, according to two senior administration officials and one industry official who was informed Monday about the final version,\u201d Lena Sun and Amy Goldstein report. \u201cStill, even the possibility of National Guard involvement has infuriated hospital industry leaders, who say any data collection problems lie primarily with the Department of Health and Human Services and repeatedly changing federal instructions.\"Schools in Los Angeles, San Diego and Atlanta will remain closed in the fall, teaching entirely online.\u00a0\u201cSchools in Nashville plan to do the same, at least through Labor Day. Several other big cities were considering similar plans, while others have adopted hybrid plans where students will be in school on certain days and at home on others. Some have announced plans to open five days a week, as the White House has demanded, but they appear to be in the minority,\u201d Laura Meckler reports. \u201cAt the White House Monday, Trump again pressed his case for in-person learning. \u2018Schools should be opened,\u2019 he said when asked for his message to worried parents. \u2018Schools should be opened. Kids want to go to school. You\u2019re losing a lot of lives by keeping things closed.'\"Trump is pushing colleges to reopen. Their health centers aren't prepared to handle the crisis. \u00a0\u201cAs millions go back to school during the pandemic, the ability of campus health services to safeguard and care for students will be tested as never before \u2014 and many colleges appear unprepared for the challenge. To assess the landscape of student health services at roughly 1,700 four-year residential campuses, The Post interviewed more than 200 students, parents and health officials and examined thousands of pages of medical records and court documents and 5,500 reviews of student health centers posted on Google,\u201d Jenn Abelson, Nicole Dungca, Meryl Kornfield and Andrew Ba Tran report. \u201cCollege students reported they commonly waited days or weeks for appointments and were routinely provided lackluster care. Dozens of students ended up hospitalized \u2014 and some near death \u2014 for mistakes they said were made at on-campus clinics \u2026 Many students, including low-income individuals on Medicaid, said they avoided seeking treatment altogether because the care was too costly.\u201dCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) announced a dramatic rollback of the state\u2019s reopening plan.Newsom ordered restaurants, wineries, movie theaters and museums to close their indoor operations. Bars have to shut down even for outdoor service, Griff Witte reports. \u201cMeanwhile, Miami was declared the latest \u2018epicenter of the pandemic,\u2019 and a senior medical official compared it to Wuhan at the height of China\u2019s struggles with the virus. \u2026 Monday\u2019s figures showed that the virus continues to spread widely beyond the hard-hit Sun Belt states. Virginia, West Virginia, Alaska, Missouri, Hawaii, Rhode Island and Minnesota all saw the average rate of new infections rise between 41 and 55 percent compared with the week of July 6. Colorado, Kentucky, the District of Columbia, Montana, North Dakota and the Virgin Islands saw increases of average new infections at a rate of 63 percent or higher. Sparsely populated North Dakota had a particularly intense week, with the number of infections nearly doubling from 44 to 84.\u201dAmericans\u2019 use of masks varies greatly by demographics, a Gallup poll found.The poll found less than half of Americans are following health officials\u2019 guidance and always covering their nose and mouth while in public. Only 44 percent of American adults say they \u201calways\u201d wear their masks when outside home, with 28 percent saying they do so \u201cvery often.\u201d Fourteen percent say they \u201cnever\u201d wear a face mask. Majorities of women (54 percent), Democrats (61 percent) and Northeasterners (54 percent) say they always use masks outside their homes, while their counterparts do so less often. A majority of Republicans \u2014 54 percent \u2014 said they wear masks infrequently, including 27 percent who said they never do.\u00a0ADADSen.

(WSJ)Operation Warp Speed is pushing for treatment options to arrive months before the most optimistic vaccine timeline.\u00a0\u201c\u2018Vaccines are the permanent hope for controlling this outbreak, but even with success, some people may not respond to vaccines and some may not get vaccinated, so we are always going to need therapeutics,\u2019 said Janet Woodcock, who is leading the therapeutics effort,\u201d Carolyn Johnson reports. \u201c\u2026 Woodcock also emphasized the prospects for monoclonal antibodies, biotechnology drugs that can block the coronavirus and that are moving into large-scale trials this summer, in hopes of determining whether they are effective by fall.\"There\u2019s also a race to produce billions of vials and syringes needed to deliver the vaccine around the world.\u00a0\u201cThe job of delivering a vaccine to a majority of humans is so vast that global production of pharmaceutical vials needs to be ramped up by 5 to 10 percent within two years, a job the industry says requires immediate preparation and increases in production but is not an insurmountable challenge,\u201d Christopher Rowland reports.The pandemic has stripped approximately 5.4 million Americans of their health insurance.An analysis to be released today by the nonpartisan group Families USA \u201cfound that the estimated increase in uninsured workers from February to May was nearly 40 percent higher than the highest previous increase, which occurred during the recession of 2008 and 2009, when 3.9 million adults lost insurance,\u201d the Times reports. \u201cThe nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation has estimated that 27 million Americans have lost coverage in the pandemic; that study took into account family members of the insured. Another analysis, published Monday by the Urban Institute and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, projected that by the end of 2020, 10.1 million people will no longer have employer-sponsored health insurance or coverage that was tied to a job they lost because of the pandemic.\u201d \u00a0Workers are being pushed to the brink as they continue to wait for their delayed unemployment checks.\u00a0\u201cAlexis Herdez has been filing for unemployment every week since April, shortly after she was laid off on her first day of work at a bridal clothing store. But more than two months later, the 23-year-old in Lexington, Ky., has yet to receive any payment,\u201d Eli Rosenberg reports. \u201cFour months into the worst recession since the Great Depression, tens of thousands of workers like Herdez across the country have filed for jobless claims but have yet to receive payments. Many are now in dire financial straits. \u2018We\u2019ve been only able to make half payments on everything,\u2019 Herdez said \u2026 \u2018We bought a large amount of groceries and have been taking things out of the freezer, but as the weeks go by, it\u2019s hard to figure out whether to pay bills or whether we have enough food to last the week.\u2019 \u2026 The ongoing delays are the result of a confluence of crises, experts say. A flood of new jobless applications \u2014 about 50 million \u2014 has overwhelmed state unemployment offices over the past four months. The agencies themselves are hampered by years of neglect.\u201d\u00a0The U.S. budget deficit shattered a one-month record in June after spending outpaced revenue by $864 billion.\u00a0\u201cIn June 2019, the budget deficit was just $8 billion,\u201d Jeff Stein reports. \u201cFederal spending rose to more than $1.1 trillion in June, more than twice what the U.S. government spends in a typical month. The amount of tax revenue collected by the federal government remained largely flat, at about $240 billion, in part because the Treasury Department delayed the tax filing deadline until July. The huge surge in June pushed the budget deficit for the first nine months of the fiscal year to $2.7 trillion.\"Small-business owners are giving up.\u201cThe resurgence of the virus, especially in states such as Texas, Florida and California that had begun to reopen, has introduced a far darker reality for many small businesses: Their temporary closures might become permanent. Nearly 66,000 businesses have folded since March 1, according to data from Yelp,\u201d the Times reports.The Trump presidencyTrump\u2019s niece can publish her book about the president and his family, a judge ruled.\u00a0\u201cA state court judge on Monday issued an 11th-hour ruling affirming Simon & Schuster's right to publish an explosive new book by Trump's niece, issuing a decision that prioritizes the First Amendment over a dated confidentiality agreement among members of the Trump family,\u201d Shayna Jacobs reports. \u201cThe book by Mary L. Trump \u2014 \u2018Too Much and Never Enough: How My Family Created the World\u2019s Most Dangerous Man\u2019 \u2014 is slated for release [today]. Some copies already have been distributed, and the work is already considered a bestseller. \u2026 Mary Trump, 55, was sued by her uncle Robert Trump, the president\u2019s brother, in an effort to block publication. He had accused her of violating a confidentiality agreement in an inheritance case settled two decades ago. \u2026 In Dutchess County, N.Y., Justice Hal Greenwald said that Simon & Schuster had no obligations under the family\u2019s nondisclosure agreement and that constitutional law \u2018trumps contracts.\u2019 \u2026\u00a0Trump was granted a second 45-day extension to file his personal financial disclosure forms.\u00a0\u201cThe forms are supposed to detail Trump\u2019s income, debt, stock holdings and outstanding loans for 2019. They were originally due May 15, but Trump got an extension until the end of June,\u201d David Fahrenthold and Anu Narayanswamy report. \u201cOn June 29, Scott Gast, deputy counsel to the president, granted Trump a second extension, until Aug. 13, according to the letter. Federal law allows only two such extensions. Gast\u2019s letter said that the extension was given for \u2018good cause,\u2019 but did not specify what that cause was. A White House spokesperson said Trump \u2018has a complicated report, and he\u2019s been focused on addressing the coronavirus and other matters.\u2019\u201dHouse Democrats will revive a legal effort to get Trump\u2019s financial records.\u00a0\u201cIn a\u00a0filing late Monday, the House\u2019s top lawyer, Douglas Letter, urged the [Supreme Court] to immediately effectuate their July 9 ruling on the House\u2019s subpoena for Trump\u2019s records. Once the ruling is in force, the House can return to the U.S. District Court judge who initially heard the case and ask for renewed consideration,\u201d Politico reports. Last week, \u201cthe justices devised a four-part test to determine whether an effort by Congress to obtain the personal papers of a sitting president is proper \u2013 and they urged the lower courts to apply this test on any future attempt by lawmakers to get [the records] \u2026 Letter noted that the [ruling] would normally take effect on Aug. 3 without the intervention of the justices. The lower courts can\u2019t begin to take up the effort until the Supreme Court ruling takes hold, and the House is urging the justices to make that happen as quickly as possible.\u201d\u00a0More Republicans are dropping out of the Jacksonville convention.\u201cSenators Roy Blunt of Missouri and Pat Roberts of Kansas are planning to skip the Republican National Convention next month,\u201d the Times reports. \u201cRepresentatives Mario Diaz-Balart and Francis Rooney of Florida are sticking with their plans not to attend, even though the convention is now in their home state. Marco Rubio, Florida\u2019s senior senator, has not committed to attending. Neither has John Thune of South Dakota, the second-ranking Senate Republican, or Representative Liz Cheney of Wyoming, the third-ranking House Republican. \u2026 \u2018Everybody just assumes no one is going,\u2019 said Representative Darin LaHood of Illinois, an honorary state co-chairman for the Trump campaign. Mr. LaHood was one of eight House members \u2014 from Illinois, New York, Arizona, Indiana and Michigan \u2014 [who said] they did not plan to attend. \u2026\u00a0ADAD\u201cStill, even as growing numbers of elected leaders express wariness about attending, a strong contingent of Republican National Committee members \u2014 many of whom have their political fortunes tied to Mr. Trump \u2014 say they still plan to go. In interviews, more than a dozen of them said they were committed, even \u2018proud,\u2019 to celebrate the renomination of Mr. Trump. \u2026 The result may be a crowd that is far Trumpier than in 2016 \u2026 \u2018It\u2019s a risk you have to take,\u2019 said Morton Blackwell, 80, an R.N.C. member from Virginia who has attended every party convention since he was the youngest elected delegate backing Barry Goldwater in 1964. \u2018You take risks every day. You drive down the street and a cement truck could crash into you. You can\u2019t not do what you have to do because of some possibility of a bad result.\u2019\u201d\u00a0Other news that should be on your radarAlabama and Texas are holding Senate runoffs today, while Maine is holding House and Senate primaries.\u00a0\u201cAlabama Republicans, hoping to reclaim a seat they fumbled away three years ago to Sen. Doug Jones (D), have been lukewarm about renominating Jeff Sessions, the former U.S. attorney general, for his old Senate seat and instead are leaning toward former Auburn University football coach Tommy Tuberville. And in Texas, Democrats appeared headed toward easily nominating M.J. Hegar, an Air Force veteran whose biography nearly helped her win a House seat in 2018, to take on Republican Sen. John Cornyn as he tries to win a fourth term. But a late charge from state Sen. Royce West has prompted outside support to pour in to try to bring Hegar, favored by Democrats in Washington, across the finish line,\u201d Paul Kane reports.\u201cWhoever emerges from the Sessions-Tuberville race \u2026 will be functionally broke. GOP strategists believe Jones, who had raised more than $15 million by March 30 and has been spending on largely positive ads, will immediately launch a sharp negative attack on the Republican nominee, who will be scrambling to raise money for the general election. \u2026 Maine holds its House and Senate primaries Tuesday \u2026 Sara Gideon, the State House speaker, is the prohibitive favorite to win the Democratic nomination to challenge Sen. Susan Collins (R) in the general election.\u201dDemocrats are setting their sights on expanding their hold on the House amid GOP troubles. \u201cThe shift in fortunes marks a turnabout for House Democrats, who originally predicted trouble for 31 members representing seats Trump won in 2016,\u201d\u00a0Rachael Bade reports. \u201cBut Trump\u2019s political standing in many of those same districts has fallen, as Biden has taken a clear lead in public polling. Plus, 37 of the most vulnerable front-line Democrats raised more than $500,000 last quarter, with 34 now stockpiling more than $2 million cash on hand, according to the DCCC.\u201dIn the primary elections held so far this year, at least 65,000 mail-in ballots were rejected for tardiness.\u00a0\u201cAt least 65,000 absentee or mail-in ballots have been rejected because they arrived past the deadline, often through no fault of the voter,\u201d NPR reports. \u201cWhile the numbers are relatively small \u2014 around 1% in most states \u2014 they could prove crucial in a close election, especially one in which many more voters are expected to cast absentee and mail-in ballots to avoid going to the polls during a pandemic.\u201d\u00a0Prosecutors say Ghislaine Maxwell used former British military personnel as personal security.\u00a0Maxwell, who is accused of grooming girls for Jeffrey Epstein, \u201csought to evade FBI detection by using former British military personnel as personal security and wrapping her cellphone in tin foil in an apparent anti-tracing attempt, federal prosecutors alleged. When the FBI moved on Maxwell at her estate in New Hampshire about two weeks ago, agents had to break down the door and found Maxwell hiding in a room in the interior of the home, according to a new court filing from the government opposing her release on bail,\u201d Shayna Jacobs reports. \u201cThe U.S. attorney\u2019s office for the Southern District of New York has maintained that Maxwell, who has citizenship in three countries including the United States, is a flight risk. She was tracked down at the secluded estate in Bradford, N.H., and arrested July 2.\u201d \u00a0Britain will bar Chinese tech giant Huawei from its 5G wireless networks in what is a major blow to the company and a win for the Trump administration, which has been pushing allies to shun the company.

Subscribe today.arrow-rightOver the past five days, the United States has suffered a worsening resurgence of coronavirus cases indicating that \u2014 after six months \u2014 the most powerful country in the world has made little progress in controlling the virus and that Americans may indefinitely remain its prisoners.President Trump, meanwhile, has been largely MIA on a question most citizens expect their president to address: What does he plan to do now to better protect the public health and return the country to normalcy?ADThe American people heard little from their president over the weekend on the worrisome infections spreading throughout the South and West.ADFrom Thursday to today, Trump apparently preferred to spend his time on other things.\u00a0He wiped away the prison sentence of his convicted political adviser Roger Stone and golfed two days in a row at his Trump National Golf Club on the banks of the Potomac River. The president sent out dozens of tweets, including some that threatened 10-year prison sentences for protesters who defile federal monuments and statues, defended his border wall, and congratulated his Fox News booster Sean Hannity for a \u201cbig night\u201d of viewer ratings on Thursday night, when Trump was his guest.Trump has increasingly sidestepped responsibility for leading a coordinated federal response.\u00a0That behavior fits a pattern in Trump's presidency in which the president seemingly has no interest in or patience for what he considers the boring work of governing, several of his former senior advisers say, speaking on the condition of anonymity. He was not fully engaged for the hard work of defusing the pandemic, including listening to panels of experts, sifting through scientific models and making hard choices to craft a whole-of-government response, an option not seriously considered.Trump's attempts to contain the virus have always been tentative.In early spring, as his advisers pushed the reluctant president to deem the virus a public health emergency, Trump tried marketing, taking to the White House lectern almost daily to talk about the \u201cgreat\u201d job his administration was doing to tackle the disease, despite a botched testing launch that put the country way behind the curve in containment. \u00a0Trump still routinely pans testing as a \u201cdouble-edged sword,\u201d arguing it only increases the number of confirmed cases and makes his administration \u201clook bad,\u201d while \u00a0simultaneously vowing an imminent vaccine. He then tried saddling governors with the responsibility of tamping down the crisis, while calling to \u201cLIBERATE!\u201d states that wouldn't move to reopen quickly enough. Now, he is saying schools should move to fully reopen this fall despite major pushback from local officials and teachers unions.ADADThat\u2019s come into sharp relief again in the past five days, as the rate of coronavirus infections is setting records, suggesting \u00a0America is back to square one in this health crisis.\u00a0Coronavirus deaths are on the rise in every region of the country. As happened in early spring, the volume of new cases is rising so fast, particularly in the Sun Belt, that testing can\u2019t keep up. Receiving rapid test results, quarantining the sick and controlling the virus's spread is proving nearly impossible.\u00a0Several major school systems and colleges in California are retrenching on their plans to reopen this fall, and announced they will instead have online classes only for the time being. CEOs are preparing for employees to continue working remotely indefinitely after Labor Day, as well.\u00a0The worsening pandemic cries out for concrete steps from the federal government. But Trump has stubbornly sought to shift the blame for the situation and sees himself as the victim of an unfortunate convergence of circumstances.\u00a0Trump\u2019s most recent fall guy is Anthony S. Fauci.Though never entirely on the same page as his top infectious-disease specialist, the president appeared with Fauci at coronavirus task force briefings, and the two seemed to be communicating earlier in the crisis. But things have clearly changed between the two men, with Trump apparently viewing Fauci\u2019s grim message about burgeoning cases and the dangers of reopening as a threat. In the midst of the most perilous public health threat in a century, the president hasn\u2019t met with Fauci in over a month. The doctor slipped into the White House yesterday, however, to meet with Chief of Staff Mark Meadows as criticism of the administration's bashing of him intensified.In the past five days, as the news has grown more dire and Fauci has refused to sugarcoat it, Trump and his allies have sought to cast Fauci as\u00a0error-prone.ADADIn his Thursday interview with Hannity, Trump criticized Fauci as a nice guy who has nevertheless \u201cmade a lot of mistakes.\u201d By Monday, Trump\u2019s souring on the doctor\u00a0had become part of a larger concerted campaign within the White House. A senior White House official anonymously gave reporters opposition-research-style bullet points of comments Fauci made about the virus that were described as misleading or inaccurate. They included Fauci\u2019s early advice that people who didn\u2019t feel sick need not wear masks and should preserve the supply for medical workers, and Fauci typically cautioned the situation was evolving.The White House list doesn\u2019t mention Trump's repeated inaccurate and misleading comments about the virus and the government's response, including his claim the U.S. could reopen safely by Easter or his recommendation that people with covid-19 could get better by taking hydroxychloroquine or possibly by being treated with bleach or ultraviolet light. The list didn\u2019t mention when Trump in January insisted the coronavirus was \u201ctotally under control\u201d and would create only a few U.S. cases, or when he said the number of cases would \u201cgo down to zero.\u201d\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s going to disappear,\u201d Trump said Feb. 28. \u201cOne day it\u2019s like a miracle, it will disappear.\u201dADADThe campaign of presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden on Monday attacked Trump\u2019s effort to blame Fauci.\u201cOver 135,000 Americans have lost their lives and tens of millions have lost their jobs because Donald Trump spent the last six months disastrously mismanaging the worst public health crisis in a century, the whole time failing to heed the warnings and guidance of medical experts \u2014 particularly Dr. Fauci,\u201d Biden campaign spokesman Andrew Bates said.\u00a0So much of Trump\u2019s response is part of the playbook he deployed during the first three years of his presidency.\u00a0Trump finds governing tedious, several of his senior former advisers have said. He likes to make decisions on impulse, and later, if those decisions blow up in his face, he tends to blame others for making them.ADThough Trump repeatedly praised his defense secretary Jim Mattis as one of his best Cabinet picks ever, he later concluded the four-star general was \u201coverrated\u201d after he resigned in protest of Trump\u2019s decision to pull U.S. soldiers out of Syria. Trump made the decision on the fly during a phone call when Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan asked him to leave Syria. Mattis felt it was militarily unwise to exit the battlefield, which would just allow Islamic State factions to regain their strongholds. He also considered it unethical to leave America's Kurdish allies in danger, and inexplicable for Trump to grant this gift to Erdogan without any benefit to the United States.\u00a0ADWhen Trump was in Paris in November 2018 and didn\u2019t want to go to a sacred memorial to fallen American soldiers in World War II, he asked his chief of staff John Kelly and another aide for options. They said he could blame his absence on weather; it would be difficult to clear the streets for his motorcade at the last minute and potentially worrisome to fly by helicopter. But when Trump got terrible press for skipping the event, with some critics asking if he didn\u2019t want to get his hair wet,\u00a0Trump blamed Kelly, saying he should have talked him into attending.\u201cHe never apologizes,\u201d said one former senior adviser who left the Trump administration. \u201cIt\u2019s always somebody else\u2019s fault. He can\u2019t take responsibility for any decision.\u201d\u00a0ADThis March, Trump blamed the rules and regulations from the Obama administration for his administration\u2019s inability to test enough Americans for the virus to control its spread at a critical early stage. He didn\u2019t mention that he and his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, had feared that such rapid, emergency testing might be bad for the markets and the economy.AD\u201cI don't take responsibility at all,\u201d Trump said.Governing is boring, hard, uncertain. Blaming is infinitely easier.Quote of the day\u201cIt\u2019s shocking,\u201d said Janis Orlowski, chief health-care officer of the Association of American Medical Colleges and one of many academics and researchers who rallied to defend Fauci from White House attacks. \u201cWhen you begin to discredit scientists like Fauci, who are national treasures, you are in serious trouble.\u201d (Laurie McGinley and Yasmeen Abutaleb)More on the coronavirusThe White House will ask states to consider calling up the National Guard to help with data collection. \u00a0\u201cA letter, to be sent to governors imminently, backs away from earlier drafts as recently as Friday that had directed state leaders to deploy the National Guard to help hospitals with daily data submissions. It now includes the National Guard among states\u2019 options for improving the data flow, according to two senior administration officials and one industry official who was informed Monday about the final version,\u201d Lena Sun and Amy Goldstein report. \u201cStill, even the possibility of National Guard involvement has infuriated hospital industry leaders, who say any data collection problems lie primarily with the Department of Health and Human Services and repeatedly changing federal instructions.\"Schools in Los Angeles, San Diego and Atlanta will remain closed in the fall, teaching entirely online.\u00a0\u201cSchools in Nashville plan to do the same, at least through Labor Day. Several other big cities were considering similar plans, while others have adopted hybrid plans where students will be in school on certain days and at home on others. Some have announced plans to open five days a week, as the White House has demanded, but they appear to be in the minority,\u201d Laura Meckler reports. \u201cAt the White House Monday, Trump again pressed his case for in-person learning. \u2018Schools should be opened,\u2019 he said when asked for his message to worried parents. \u2018Schools should be opened. Kids want to go to school. You\u2019re losing a lot of lives by keeping things closed.'\"Trump is pushing colleges to reopen. Their health centers aren't prepared to handle the crisis. \u00a0\u201cAs millions go back to school during the pandemic, the ability of campus health services to safeguard and care for students will be tested as never before \u2014 and many colleges appear unprepared for the challenge. To assess the landscape of student health services at roughly 1,700 four-year residential campuses, The Post interviewed more than 200 students, parents and health officials and examined thousands of pages of medical records and court documents and 5,500 reviews of student health centers posted on Google,\u201d Jenn Abelson, Nicole Dungca, Meryl Kornfield and Andrew Ba Tran report. \u201cCollege students reported they commonly waited days or weeks for appointments and were routinely provided lackluster care. Dozens of students ended up hospitalized \u2014 and some near death \u2014 for mistakes they said were made at on-campus clinics \u2026 Many students, including low-income individuals on Medicaid, said they avoided seeking treatment altogether because the care was too costly.\u201dCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) announced a dramatic rollback of the state\u2019s reopening plan.Newsom ordered restaurants, wineries, movie theaters and museums to close their indoor operations. Bars have to shut down even for outdoor service, Griff Witte reports. \u201cMeanwhile, Miami was declared the latest \u2018epicenter of the pandemic,\u2019 and a senior medical official compared it to Wuhan at the height of China\u2019s struggles with the virus. \u2026 Monday\u2019s figures showed that the virus continues to spread widely beyond the hard-hit Sun Belt states. Virginia, West Virginia, Alaska, Missouri, Hawaii, Rhode Island and Minnesota all saw the average rate of new infections rise between 41 and 55 percent compared with the week of July 6. Colorado, Kentucky, the District of Columbia, Montana, North Dakota and the Virgin Islands saw increases of average new infections at a rate of 63 percent or higher. Sparsely populated North Dakota had a particularly intense week, with the number of infections nearly doubling from 44 to 84.\u201dAmericans\u2019 use of masks varies greatly by demographics, a Gallup poll found.The poll found less than half of Americans are following health officials\u2019 guidance and always covering their nose and mouth while in public. Only 44 percent of American adults say they \u201calways\u201d wear their masks when outside home, with 28 percent saying they do so \u201cvery often.\u201d Fourteen percent say they \u201cnever\u201d wear a face mask. Majorities of women (54 percent), Democrats (61 percent) and Northeasterners (54 percent) say they always use masks outside their homes, while their counterparts do so less often. A majority of Republicans \u2014 54 percent \u2014 said they wear masks infrequently, including 27 percent who said they never do.\u00a0ADADSen.

(WSJ)Operation Warp Speed is pushing for treatment options to arrive months before the most optimistic vaccine timeline.\u00a0\u201c\u2018Vaccines are the permanent hope for controlling this outbreak, but even with success, some people may not respond to vaccines and some may not get vaccinated, so we are always going to need therapeutics,\u2019 said Janet Woodcock, who is leading the therapeutics effort,\u201d Carolyn Johnson reports. \u201c\u2026 Woodcock also emphasized the prospects for monoclonal antibodies, biotechnology drugs that can block the coronavirus and that are moving into large-scale trials this summer, in hopes of determining whether they are effective by fall.\"There\u2019s also a race to produce billions of vials and syringes needed to deliver the vaccine around the world.\u00a0\u201cThe job of delivering a vaccine to a majority of humans is so vast that global production of pharmaceutical vials needs to be ramped up by 5 to 10 percent within two years, a job the industry says requires immediate preparation and increases in production but is not an insurmountable challenge,\u201d Christopher Rowland reports.The pandemic has stripped approximately 5.4 million Americans of their health insurance.An analysis to be released today by the nonpartisan group Families USA \u201cfound that the estimated increase in uninsured workers from February to May was nearly 40 percent higher than the highest previous increase, which occurred during the recession of 2008 and 2009, when 3.9 million adults lost insurance,\u201d the Times reports. \u201cThe nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation has estimated that 27 million Americans have lost coverage in the pandemic; that study took into account family members of the insured. Another analysis, published Monday by the Urban Institute and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, projected that by the end of 2020, 10.1 million people will no longer have employer-sponsored health insurance or coverage that was tied to a job they lost because of the pandemic.\u201d \u00a0Workers are being pushed to the brink as they continue to wait for their delayed unemployment checks.\u00a0\u201cAlexis Herdez has been filing for unemployment every week since April, shortly after she was laid off on her first day of work at a bridal clothing store. But more than two months later, the 23-year-old in Lexington, Ky., has yet to receive any payment,\u201d Eli Rosenberg reports. \u201cFour months into the worst recession since the Great Depression, tens of thousands of workers like Herdez across the country have filed for jobless claims but have yet to receive payments. Many are now in dire financial straits. \u2018We\u2019ve been only able to make half payments on everything,\u2019 Herdez said \u2026 \u2018We bought a large amount of groceries and have been taking things out of the freezer, but as the weeks go by, it\u2019s hard to figure out whether to pay bills or whether we have enough food to last the week.\u2019 \u2026 The ongoing delays are the result of a confluence of crises, experts say. A flood of new jobless applications \u2014 about 50 million \u2014 has overwhelmed state unemployment offices over the past four months. The agencies themselves are hampered by years of neglect.\u201d\u00a0The U.S. budget deficit shattered a one-month record in June after spending outpaced revenue by $864 billion.\u00a0\u201cIn June 2019, the budget deficit was just $8 billion,\u201d Jeff Stein reports. \u201cFederal spending rose to more than $1.1 trillion in June, more than twice what the U.S. government spends in a typical month. The amount of tax revenue collected by the federal government remained largely flat, at about $240 billion, in part because the Treasury Department delayed the tax filing deadline until July. The huge surge in June pushed the budget deficit for the first nine months of the fiscal year to $2.7 trillion.\"Small-business owners are giving up.\u201cThe resurgence of the virus, especially in states such as Texas, Florida and California that had begun to reopen, has introduced a far darker reality for many small businesses: Their temporary closures might become permanent. Nearly 66,000 businesses have folded since March 1, according to data from Yelp,\u201d the Times reports.The Trump presidencyTrump\u2019s niece can publish her book about the president and his family, a judge ruled.\u00a0\u201cA state court judge on Monday issued an 11th-hour ruling affirming Simon & Schuster's right to publish an explosive new book by Trump's niece, issuing a decision that prioritizes the First Amendment over a dated confidentiality agreement among members of the Trump family,\u201d Shayna Jacobs reports. \u201cThe book by Mary L. Trump \u2014 \u2018Too Much and Never Enough: How My Family Created the World\u2019s Most Dangerous Man\u2019 \u2014 is slated for release [today]. Some copies already have been distributed, and the work is already considered a bestseller. \u2026 Mary Trump, 55, was sued by her uncle Robert Trump, the president\u2019s brother, in an effort to block publication. He had accused her of violating a confidentiality agreement in an inheritance case settled two decades ago. \u2026 In Dutchess County, N.Y., Justice Hal Greenwald said that Simon & Schuster had no obligations under the family\u2019s nondisclosure agreement and that constitutional law \u2018trumps contracts.\u2019 \u2026\u00a0Trump was granted a second 45-day extension to file his personal financial disclosure forms.\u00a0\u201cThe forms are supposed to detail Trump\u2019s income, debt, stock holdings and outstanding loans for 2019. They were originally due May 15, but Trump got an extension until the end of June,\u201d David Fahrenthold and Anu Narayanswamy report. \u201cOn June 29, Scott Gast, deputy counsel to the president, granted Trump a second extension, until Aug. 13, according to the letter. Federal law allows only two such extensions. Gast\u2019s letter said that the extension was given for \u2018good cause,\u2019 but did not specify what that cause was. A White House spokesperson said Trump \u2018has a complicated report, and he\u2019s been focused on addressing the coronavirus and other matters.\u2019\u201dHouse Democrats will revive a legal effort to get Trump\u2019s financial records.\u00a0\u201cIn a\u00a0filing late Monday, the House\u2019s top lawyer, Douglas Letter, urged the [Supreme Court] to immediately effectuate their July 9 ruling on the House\u2019s subpoena for Trump\u2019s records. Once the ruling is in force, the House can return to the U.S. District Court judge who initially heard the case and ask for renewed consideration,\u201d Politico reports. Last week, \u201cthe justices devised a four-part test to determine whether an effort by Congress to obtain the personal papers of a sitting president is proper \u2013 and they urged the lower courts to apply this test on any future attempt by lawmakers to get [the records] \u2026 Letter noted that the [ruling] would normally take effect on Aug. 3 without the intervention of the justices. The lower courts can\u2019t begin to take up the effort until the Supreme Court ruling takes hold, and the House is urging the justices to make that happen as quickly as possible.\u201d\u00a0More Republicans are dropping out of the Jacksonville convention.\u201cSenators Roy Blunt of Missouri and Pat Roberts of Kansas are planning to skip the Republican National Convention next month,\u201d the Times reports. \u201cRepresentatives Mario Diaz-Balart and Francis Rooney of Florida are sticking with their plans not to attend, even though the convention is now in their home state. Marco Rubio, Florida\u2019s senior senator, has not committed to attending. Neither has John Thune of South Dakota, the second-ranking Senate Republican, or Representative Liz Cheney of Wyoming, the third-ranking House Republican. \u2026 \u2018Everybody just assumes no one is going,\u2019 said Representative Darin LaHood of Illinois, an honorary state co-chairman for the Trump campaign. Mr. LaHood was one of eight House members \u2014 from Illinois, New York, Arizona, Indiana and Michigan \u2014 [who said] they did not plan to attend. \u2026\u00a0ADAD\u201cStill, even as growing numbers of elected leaders express wariness about attending, a strong contingent of Republican National Committee members \u2014 many of whom have their political fortunes tied to Mr. Trump \u2014 say they still plan to go. In interviews, more than a dozen of them said they were committed, even \u2018proud,\u2019 to celebrate the renomination of Mr. Trump. \u2026 The result may be a crowd that is far Trumpier than in 2016 \u2026 \u2018It\u2019s a risk you have to take,\u2019 said Morton Blackwell, 80, an R.N.C. member from Virginia who has attended every party convention since he was the youngest elected delegate backing Barry Goldwater in 1964. \u2018You take risks every day. You drive down the street and a cement truck could crash into you. You can\u2019t not do what you have to do because of some possibility of a bad result.\u2019\u201d\u00a0Other news that should be on your radarAlabama and Texas are holding Senate runoffs today, while Maine is holding House and Senate primaries.\u00a0\u201cAlabama Republicans, hoping to reclaim a seat they fumbled away three years ago to Sen. Doug Jones (D), have been lukewarm about renominating Jeff Sessions, the former U.S. attorney general, for his old Senate seat and instead are leaning toward former Auburn University football coach Tommy Tuberville. And in Texas, Democrats appeared headed toward easily nominating M.J. Hegar, an Air Force veteran whose biography nearly helped her win a House seat in 2018, to take on Republican Sen. John Cornyn as he tries to win a fourth term. But a late charge from state Sen. Royce West has prompted outside support to pour in to try to bring Hegar, favored by Democrats in Washington, across the finish line,\u201d Paul Kane reports.\u201cWhoever emerges from the Sessions-Tuberville race \u2026 will be functionally broke. GOP strategists believe Jones, who had raised more than $15 million by March 30 and has been spending on largely positive ads, will immediately launch a sharp negative attack on the Republican nominee, who will be scrambling to raise money for the general election. \u2026 Maine holds its House and Senate primaries Tuesday \u2026 Sara Gideon, the State House speaker, is the prohibitive favorite to win the Democratic nomination to challenge Sen. Susan Collins (R) in the general election.\u201dDemocrats are setting their sights on expanding their hold on the House amid GOP troubles. \u201cThe shift in fortunes marks a turnabout for House Democrats, who originally predicted trouble for 31 members representing seats Trump won in 2016,\u201d\u00a0Rachael Bade reports. \u201cBut Trump\u2019s political standing in many of those same districts has fallen, as Biden has taken a clear lead in public polling. Plus, 37 of the most vulnerable front-line Democrats raised more than $500,000 last quarter, with 34 now stockpiling more than $2 million cash on hand, according to the DCCC.\u201dIn the primary elections held so far this year, at least 65,000 mail-in ballots were rejected for tardiness.\u00a0\u201cAt least 65,000 absentee or mail-in ballots have been rejected because they arrived past the deadline, often through no fault of the voter,\u201d NPR reports. \u201cWhile the numbers are relatively small \u2014 around 1% in most states \u2014 they could prove crucial in a close election, especially one in which many more voters are expected to cast absentee and mail-in ballots to avoid going to the polls during a pandemic.\u201d\u00a0Prosecutors say Ghislaine Maxwell used former British military personnel as personal security.\u00a0Maxwell, who is accused of grooming girls for Jeffrey Epstein, \u201csought to evade FBI detection by using former British military personnel as personal security and wrapping her cellphone in tin foil in an apparent anti-tracing attempt, federal prosecutors alleged. When the FBI moved on Maxwell at her estate in New Hampshire about two weeks ago, agents had to break down the door and found Maxwell hiding in a room in the interior of the home, according to a new court filing from the government opposing her release on bail,\u201d Shayna Jacobs reports. \u201cThe U.S. attorney\u2019s office for the Southern District of New York has maintained that Maxwell, who has citizenship in three countries including the United States, is a flight risk. She was tracked down at the secluded estate in Bradford, N.H., and arrested July 2.\u201d \u00a0Britain will bar Chinese tech giant Huawei from its 5G wireless networks in what is a major blow to the company and a win for the Trump administration, which has been pushing allies to shun the company.

Although\u00a0only\u00a04% of their time is spent on\u00a0e-commerce, it\u2019s enough to drive $1.5 trillion in\u00a0annual online sales. The\u00a0smaller Indian market, with online sales of $40 billion, will want to copy the\u00a0playbook. \u00a0The\u00a0most obvious super-app\u00a0candidate\u00a0is billionaire Mukesh Ambani\u2019s Jio Platforms Ltd., a four-year-old\u00a0startup with an equity\u00a0value of $65\u00a0billion, including\u00a0more than  $15 billion recently raised from investors including Facebook Inc., KKR & Co. and Silver Lake Partners. Before Jio eventually  seeks a listing on Nasdaq or the New York Stock Exchange, Ambani would probably want it ready as a carriage-content-and-commerce powerhouse for half-a-billion people.ADADJio\u2019s 4G telecom service already has roughly 400 million subscribers, though\u00a0they currently\u00a0don\u2019t even pay $2 a month. The\u00a0trick to a $100 billion-plus initial public offering\u00a0would lie in using\u00a0the partnership with Facebook to introduce features such as the WeChat mini-program via the popular\u00a0WhatsApp messaging service. It lets users\u00a0book hotels, order taxis, explore\u00a0augmented reality to try on\u00a0a new L\u2019Oreal beauty product, or\u00a0test-drive\u00a0a Tesla \u2014 without leaving WeChat.\u00a0When it comes to building product awareness and interest, these embedded mini-apps in China are now a fourth as effective\u00a0as regular online stores run by\u00a0JD.com Inc. and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., according to McKinsey & Co.

This\u00a0will probably hold true for India as well.\u00a0As for the actual commerce, JioMart, Ambani\u2019s new\u00a0e-commerce platform, would\u00a0take orders and \u2014\u00a0if the regulator permits it \u2014\u00a0accept payments via WhatsApp.\u00a0Staples could\u00a0be delivered\u00a0by traditional neighborhood stores, with Jio helping connect them to buyers.

Still, the\u00a0road to satisfied digital customers will be\u00a0long and bumpy because of India\u2019s creaky infrastructure. Keeping users\u00a0hooked with novel content will therefore be\u00a0crucial.\u00a0Facebook\u00a0is building a new version\u00a0of\u00a0Quest\u00a0virtual reality headsets; the Silicon Valley firm is\u00a0also acquiring\u00a0studios that make VR games. Jio, which wants its set-top box to support  online gaming, could find opportunities for\u00a0collaboration.ADADHowever, the\u00a0main entertainment fare\u00a0will still be cricket and Bollywood. Last year, Ambani promised\u00a0Jio First Day First Show\u00a0\u2014\u00a0movies streamed to\u00a0broadband customers on the day of their theater release. With Covid-19 shutting down cinemas,\u00a0producers in India need digital alternatives; audiences need their fix. \u00a0Although\u00a0Ambani appears to be\u00a0ahead, his won\u2019t be India\u2019s\u00a0only super-app. Amazon.com Inc. has pledged to invest $5.5 billion in the country, while Walmart Inc. has plowed in $16\u00a0billion to acquire\u00a0local e-commerce leader\u00a0Flipkart Online Services Pvt.

Subscribe today.arrow-rightIndia\u2019s government banned 59 Chinese mobile apps, including TikTok and WeChat,  week, seemingly in retaliation for the killing of at least 20 of its soldiers along the disputed border between the countries high in the Himalayas. The reason provided was national security; officials said in a statement that the programs were \u201cstealing and surreptitiously transmitting users\u2019 data\u201d to servers outside India. The initial announcement was more sweeping: The barred services were \u201cprejudicial to sovereignty and integrity of India, defence of India, security of state and public order.\u201dCyber sovereignty has long been a central component of the Chinese government\u2019s approach to the Web, an approach it has been advocating to the rest of the world. Every nation, the thinking goes, ought to exercise control over the flow of information within its borders \u2014 and into or out of them, too. Every country, including democratic states, has an interest in some restrictions on an otherwise open Internet: rules against illegal material such as child exploitation imagery, for example, or the prohibition of tools that pose cybersecurity risks. Yet many of the demands of authoritarian governments, justified in the name of techno-nationalism, are intended to constrict free expression and communication. These range from the wholesale blocking of global websites to insistence that data be stored locally.ADADViewed in this light, India\u2019s decision is both understandable and alarming. Answering China\u2019s provocations with economic rather than military measures is the responsible thing to do, and China set the stage for the splintering of the global Web when it erected its Great Firewall. Nor is it unreasonable for India to suspect that Chinese apps are transmitting data to that country\u2019s government \u2014 maybe not as a matter of course, but certainly if officials demand it. TikTok is under a national security review in the United States over precisely that concern. Yet going through a process to determine whether a specific risk exists for a specific company is different from cutting off access to dozens of services in one fell swoop as part of a physical turf war. What India has done turns its citizens\u2019 access to information and the outside world into a geopolitical game chip to be leveraged against another country.Almost one-third of TikTok\u2019s downloads came from India. This action will hurt China, in other words, but also more than 120 million Indians \u2014 not to mention the users of those 58 other apps. And though China\u2019s short-term interest may have been harmed, its long-term goal of a fractured Internet has been served. For those who live in countries inclined to ban Web services from abroad, this fracturing of the Internet isn\u2019t only a fracturing. It\u2019s a shrinking, too.Read more: The Post\u2019s View: TikTok and the long arm of the Chinese governmentThe Post\u2019s View: Could TikTok allow China to export repression?Barkha Dutt: The inside story of how India and China came to blows in the HimalayasBarkha Dutt: A deadly border clash should end India\u2019s delusions about ChinaMolly Roberts: Gen Z\u2019s strategy to ruin Trump\u2019s rally looks a little too familiar", "comment": "182 Comments", "topic": "The Post's View"}, {"cover": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/SADN4KWFIAI6VKBFQ4RAATSBKA.jpghttps://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/SADN4KWFIAI6VKBFQ4RAATSBKA.jpg", "title": "Trump gave up on fighting the virus.

BassettNatalia Linos", "content": "As daily rates of new coronavirus infections surpass 60,000 across the United States, repeatedly shattering single-day records, the Trump administration\u2019s narrative about the virus has shifted. What began as overconfidence intended to downplay epidemiologic data has now turned into fatalism, best captured in the recent Washington Post report that White House officials hope \u201cAmericans will grow numb to the escalating death toll and learn to accept tens of thousands of new cases a day.\u201d But what remains consistent is a failure by this administration to do the hard work needed to coordinate and orchestrate a federal response, to provide clear risk communication to the public \u2014 including, for example, the importance of mask-wearing \u2014 and to use emergency powers and flexible resources to support the necessary response to surging case counts. For a pandemic that spreads exponentially, a let-it-play-out approach that accepts mass deaths as inevitable is a disaster for this country and the world.What is going on? Part of it is a preoccupation with President Trump\u2019s ratings ahead of the November election. Public health experts, for instance, have raised alarm about political interference that removed the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from leadership in providing clear guidance for reopening and recovery based on data and evidence. Last week, the president tweeted that the CDC\u2019s guidelines for school reopening were \u201cvery tough and expensive.\u201d This assessment was followed by confusion: Vice President Pence said revised guidelines would be issued, and a day later, the CDC director, Robert Redfield, backtracked, saying they would remain the same with additional guidance provided.Support our journalism. Subscribe today.arrow-rightAnd as infection rates continue to rise, so has the White House\u2019s search for scapegoats. Managing the administration\u2019s public image appears to be the top priority, never mind that the virus is indifferent to these maneuvers. Trump\u2019s decision to direct full blame at China and the World Health Organization and withdraw from the WHO in the midst of a global pandemic is particularly worrisome. Reports that the administration is deliberating on restructuring the CDC and directing more blame for the crisis there are also troubling at a time when public health officials across the country are being threatened. And the further confirmation that National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease Director Anthony S. Fauci\u2019s input is unwanted, as the White House shares with reporters a lengthy list of \u201cmistakes\u201d made in his comments early in the outbreak, adds to a pattern of blaming and redirecting responsibility for the failed response.We can reopen schools in the fall \u2014 if we close bars and gyms nowRather than bolstering public health infrastructure, the administration\u2019s approach appears to be to blame, punish and weaken. After months of sacrifice in which Americans were asked to stay home and close businesses to reduce the virus\u2019s spread, the federal government has not ensured that anywhere can reopen safely. Instead, the Trump administration simply decided that it is now time to move on, and that not to do so amounts to taking the \u201ceasy way out.\u201d The result is pressure on schools and universities, without the government having done the necessary work to strengthen our public health systems.ADADTo be fair, the erosion of public health infrastructure has occurred across Republican and Democratic administrations, but this time, it seems to be politically motivated. And it raises the question of whether a similar calculus of blame avoidance is the reason for the administration\u2019s refusal to lead a coordinated national response. Rather than serving as a strong partner to local authorities, is it possible that the Trump White House is intentionally shifting responsibility, and therefore blame for any uptick in deaths, to governors? From the beginning, Trump has left states to fend for themselves, and he frequently blames governors \u2014 not the lack of a coordinated federal strategy \u2014 for the spread of the virus.An absent federal government means that states and local authorities need to address critical health-care shortages \u2014 such as in personal protective equipment and ventilators \u2014 on their own, incur tremendous costs in reopening schools safely, and most likely lay off a large number of government workers because there isn\u2019t significant direct aid coming to offset losses in tax and fee revenue. While Congress has enacted some relief laws, including the Cares Act in March, and it\u2019s been supplementing incomes through the Paycheck Protection Program and unemployment insurance, much greater investments are needed. Without an adequate response, individuals and communities that have the money to protect themselves will be able to do so, but the death rates will continue to climb in communities of color and among poorer Americans. Cuts in state budgets will also disproportionately harm those same communities. Already, covid-19 has demonstrated deep racial inequities. So far, excess covid-19 mortality has been borne especially by black, Latino and Native American communities. The decision to persuade the public that we must simply learn to live with thousands of infections each day disregards these inequities about who will be disproportionately harmed. In that way, it isn\u2019t just bad public health; it\u2019s also racist.Trump\u2019s encouragement of defiance of methods to reduce transmission, from rejecting masks to rushing to reopen without adequate safeguards, has already accelerated the spread of the virus. But as the pandemic sweeps into more rural areas, it is possible that the administration will need to switch tactics and narrative once again. If there is a belief in this White House that the dead won\u2019t be among \u201cour people,\u201d which one wishes was unthinkable, that ultimately will not hold up. The idea that rural and small-town white America is somehow culturally or biologically resistant will falter. Though inequality is racialized in the United States, the same circumstances that create the unfair odds of coronavirus infection \u2014 crowded housing, crowded workplaces, inadequate labor protections \u2014 also affect many white Americans.The coronavirus could hit the U.S. harder than other wealthy countriesWhen confronting lethal microbes, humans rely on our wits and capacity to collaborate, as Yale professor Frank Snowden has noted. In quick order after he took office nearly four years ago, Trump dispatched with preparedness. Now, actually faced with a pandemic, he has abandoned any input from scientists. Withdrawal from the WHO removes the United States from the main forum for international cooperation. A federal government that is witless and on its own makes inevitable the grim unfolding scenario.We hope it won\u2019t take the death toll reaching 200,000 before the administration acknowledges how disastrous the federal response has been and switches tactics.

Passengers would go on to their place of quarantine with the results made available within 24 hours.Hungary Has Biggest Infection Increase in a Month (4:19 p.m. HK)Hungary\u2019s official coronavirus cases rose by 16 in a day, the biggest increase in a month, according to data from the country\u2019s pandemic task force published on Tuesday.Total cases rose to 4,205, with 589 deaths, unchanged for a third day. Hungary has so far managed to avoid a flare up of the virus with active cases, which subtracts recoveries and deaths from total infections, steadily declining to 742 on Tuesday from over 1,100 a month ago.Europe Sees Deeper Economic Slump (4:00 p.m. HK)Europe\u2019s economy will suffer more than previously estimated this year and take longer to recover because of a slow easing of coronavirus restrictions, according to the bloc\u2019s executive arm.The European Commission forecasts a contraction of 8.7% in the euro area this year, a full percentage point deeper than previously predicted. Risks remain \u201cexceptionally high and mainly to the downside,\u201d the commission said on Tuesday.U.S. Bailouts for China\u2019s HNA (2:22 p.m. HK)HNA Group, the troubled conglomerate being taken over by the Chinese state, is among recipients of the billions of dollars in virus-relief loans handed out in the U.S. government\u2019s Paycheck Protection Program.Tokyo Finds 106 New Infections, NHK Says (2:16 p.m. HK)Tokyo found 106 cases of coronavirus on Tuesday, the sixth consecutive day new cases in the capital exceeded 100, NHK reported.

And Facebook is moving to steer the debate so the rules are written on its terms.\u00a0Support our journalism. Subscribe today.arrow-rightThe social network today released its latest white paper, a 29-page document calling current privacy practices and laws \u201cinsufficient.\u201d The company says the paper is intended to spark greater debate about how the tech industry can inform people about its use of their data \u2014 and move beyond convoluted privacy policies or notifications about cookies that pop up so frequently they make people\u2019s eyes glaze over.\u00a0\u201cI think we can all agree that obviously policies are probably not the best way of communicating about privacy,\u201d said Rob Sherman, Facebook\u2019s deputy chief privacy officer, told me in an interview.\u201cBut also there's little consensus on how to do that.\u201dThe company lays out in the paper some of the tensions it sees for businesses and regulators on privacy issues. On the one hand the company gets criticism that these policies are too long, Sherman says, but it's also trying to ensure it's making all the disclosures required to under a complex web of international laws and regulations.ADADThe paper calls for greater collaboration between regulators and companies to develop and test new ways for people to learn more about the use of their data by the giant social media platform, which has been criticized \u2013 especially surrounding Cambridge Analytica and the 2016 election \u2013 when third parties improperly obtained data of Facebook users without their knowledge.Facebook is trying to shape itself as more privacy friendly.The company was required to make major changes to its business in the year since it reached a historic $5 billion settlement with the Federal Trade Commission to end a privacy investigation. Now Facebook is hoping its forced education in improving privacy can be useful to policy advocates and regulators.\u00a0AD\u201cHopefully some of that is useful to policymakers as they're making decisions about how to regulate privacy,\u201d Sherman said. \u201cOur goal is not to try to write a law that would regulate us. There are other people that will do that. We want to certainly be a part of the discussion and give our perspective on what we think makes sense and how it would work in practice and in our environment.\u201dADGiven its spotty track record on privacy, the company is facing an uphill battle in rebuilding relationships with regulators and consumer advocates. But Sherman says Facebook has aggressively invested and hired privacy experts over the last year, adding every new product the company builds now goes through a comprehensive privacy review.\u00a0\u201cCulturally it\u2019s become very clear across Facebook that privacy is something that is essentially important for business,\u201d Sherman told me. \u201cIf people don\u2019t trust us to safeguard their data, they won\u2019t feel comfortable using our services.\u201d\u00a0ADFacebook's report arrives as countries around the world, including Australia, are cracking down on data collection. California began enforcing its new state privacy law earlier this month, which could reinvigorate the privacy debate in the United States.\u00a0ADThis isn't the first time that Facebook released a white paper. The company published one earlier this year on content moderation, another contentious issue in Washington.The coronavirus pandemic could create new privacy challenges.Facebook was planning to release the paper before the coronavirus pandemic intensified when privacy issues were a greater focus on the presidential campaign trail and on Capitol Hill. But now the debate is shifting, especially as data plays a critical role in the coronavirus response and people are spending more time using online services while staying at home.\u00a0ADOne recent bipartisan privacy proposal, which my colleague Tony Romm detailed, aimed to ensure new digital tools meant to combat the coronavirus don\u2019t come at the expense of user privacy.Sherman says the pandemic is testing some of the company's transparency and privacy work, especially as the platform seeks ways to use its data for the coronavirus response. The social network has had to communicate with users about some of its new covid-19 tools, such as providing aggregated data about its users to public health officials about the virus\u2019s spread. The company is also working with Carnegie Mellon researchers to gather covid-19 symptom data.\u00a0AD\u201cThere\u2019s also a really core responsibility that comes along with that, both to use data responsibly and also to communicate effectively with people about how their data is being used,\u201d Sherman said.\u00a0Our top tabsGoogle favors YouTube over other videos in search results \u2014 and that\u2019s no accident.\u00a0Engineers at Google made changes that intentionally drive users to YouTube, which it owns, over other streaming services, the Wall Street Journal reports.ADIn searches for the same video that appeared on different platforms, Google\u2019s homepage carousel showed YouTube results first 95 percent of the time, WSJ found. In comparison, a Facebook Watch version of the same videos showed up first just 5 percent of the time.Google spokeswoman Lara Levin denied Google search gives preference to YouTube or any other video service. \u00a0ADAllegations it prioritizes its own business over competitors could add to the heavy antitrust scrutiny the company is already under.Google\u2019s chief executive Sundar Pichai is set to testify later this month alongside the chief executives of Amazon, Facebook and Apple at a House Judiciary Committee hearing about competition in the tech industry.Apple and IBM joined the White House in a campaign to encourage Americans to retrain for new jobs.The \u201cFind Something New\u201d ad campaign also encourages employers to move away from degree-based requirements to focus on skills, Josh Wingrove and Jennifer Jacobs at Bloomberg report.\u00a0ADThe Ad Council is sponsoring the initiative, which builds off ongoing work by the White House American Workforce Policy Advisory Board, which counts Apple chief executive Tim Cook and IBM Chairman Ginni Rometty as members. Twenty private-sector organizations, including Home Depot and Lockheed Martin, backed the campaign.\u00a0AD\u201cNow, as a result of covid, people need to, unfortunately, in some cases learn a completely new skill, but that is also an opportunity to be put on a new trajectory,\u201d said Ivanka Trump, senior aide to the president, at a virtual roundtable about the initiative.\u201cWe believe that, with the right tools, people have the power to change their lives and the lives of their families for the better,\u201d Cook said during the webinar.\u00a0ADBut the campaign has already received criticism for being insensitive to the millions of workers who have lost their jobs during the pandemic, Hamza Shaban reports.\u00a0Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) called the ad campaign \u201cinsulting.\u201dOther tech companies have turned to reskilling programs to avoid layoffs. Verizon announced a pledge to prepare 500,000 lower-wage and minority workers for new jobs with job-skills training by 2030, CNN reports. The company has already retained about 20,000 of its workers for new careers to avoid pandemic layoffs.The tech industry scored a victory as the Trump administration rescinded controversial limits on international students.\u00a0Major tech companies supported a lawsuit from Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, which challenged the administration\u2019s proposal to bar international students from remaining in the United States if their colleges didn\u2019t offer in-person classes. The administration\u2019s reversal settles that lawsuit, Nick Anderson and Susan Svrluga report.ADADFacebook, Google, Microsoft and 16 other technology companies and trade associations backed the brief, which was filed by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, that alleged the policy would harm U.S. businesses.\u00a0Some celebrated the decision yesterday. TechNet, an industry trade group, praised the move:\u00a0Kent Walker, senior vice president of global affairs at Google, praised the decision on Twitter:Rant and raveAirbnb had a rough day on Twitter after a user flagged that the company was asking customers to send their favorite hosts \u201ckindness cards\u201d with an optional donation.\u00a0The stunt was the perfect storm of Internet ire toward gig companies and landlords:Others suggested that the billion-dollar company should handle its own goodwill toward hosts:Hill happeningsA Democrat is calling Apple and Google to require apps to disclose where they store data.Rep. Stephen F. Lynch (D-Mass.), chairman of the House Oversight Subcommittee on National Security, sent letters to Apple and Google saying the companies are responsible for making consumers aware of potential security risks posed by the apps.ADNeither company requires developers to disclose in which countries their data is stored.\u00a0Intelligence officials have warned that foreign applications could be compelled to share U.S. user data depending on local laws. Some lawmakers and officials have pointed to the concern in advocating for restrictions on TikTok and other Chinese apps. (TikTok says it does not store U.S. user data in China.)Lynch also asks the companies to provide details on any instances in which they removed an app for sharing personal data with a foreign government.\u00a0Workforce reportMassachusetts sued Uber and Lyft for allegedly misclassifying drivers as contractors.It is the second state after California to sue the companies over their worker status, Kate Conger and Daisuke Wakabayashi report. \u00a0Like in California, Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey is asking the court to rule that the drivers are employees under state law and force the court to prevent the companies from denying drivers employee benefits.\u201cThey have been playing this game for years,\u201d Healey said in a video announcing the lawsuit. \u00a0\u201cUber and Lyft set the rates. They alone set the rules. Drivers are employees.\u201dThe coronavirus pandemic, which has left many ride-share drivers with reduced work, has spurred growing demand for gig workers to provide their workers with benefits.\u201cNot only is it unfair and exploitative. It\u2019s illegal,\u201d she said.Uber will contest the action in court, spokesman Matt Kallman told the New York Times. Lyft spokewoman Julie Woods said the lawsuit could lead to the elimination of more than 50,000 jobs.More workforce news:Shipt workers to strike over shift to opaque pay structure (The Hill)Trump trackerTrump is taking credit for the U.K.\u2019s decision to ban Huawei from its 5G networks.The president\u2019s boast came after the United Kingdom reversed an earlier decision that would have allowed the Chinese firm to build less-sensitive parts of its 5G network.\u00a0\u201cI did this myself, for the most part,\u201d Trump said at a news conference. \u201cIt\u2019s a big security risk. I talked many countries out of using it.\u201dThe British government expects its 5G network to be totally Huawei-free by 2027 because it will be a lengthy and costly process for British companies to shed all their Huawei gear. The decision came after a U.S. ban on foreign firms selling computer chips made with U.S. equipment to Huawei.More Trump news:White House reportedly orders hospitals to bypass CDC during COVID-19 data collection (The Verge)TrendingMyspace Wasn't a Simpler Time, We Were Just Teenagers (Vice)Covid Babysitting: When Virtual Camps and Sitter Dates Get Messy (Wall Street Journal)DaybookThe House Budget Committee will hold a hearing on the need for federal investments in technology in light of the coronavirus pandemic today at 2 p.m.The Center for Democracy and Technology will host an event, \u201cA Shared Responsibility: Protecting Consumer Health Data Privacy in an Increasingly Connected World\u201d today at 4 p.m.The Center for Strategic and International Studies will host a discussion with former Google chairman and chief executive Eric Schmidt about technology, data and innovation policy on Friday at 4 p.m.The Senate Commerce subcommittee on manufacturing, trade, and consumer protection will hold a hearing on protecting Americans from coronavirus scams on July 21 at 2:30 p.m.Before you log offThis new Apple commercial is maybe a little too real.", "comment": "2 Comments", "topic": "PowerPost"}, {"cover": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/MEE2RWWFTQI6VKBFQ4RAATSBKA.jpghttps://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/MEE2RWWFTQI6VKBFQ4RAATSBKA.jpg", "title": "The Health 202: The race for a coronavirus vaccine isn't slowing, even as Trump undermines Fauci", "date": "Jul 15, 2020", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/the-health-202/2020/07/15/the-health-202-the-race-for-a-coronavirus-vaccine-isn-t-slowing-even-as-trump-undermines-fauci/5f0db81e602ff1080719b5e4/", "keyword": "China and the world order", "website": "the Washington Post", "author": "Paige Winfield Cunningham", "content": "with Paulina FiroziThe White House has been shutting out top infectious-disease expert Anthony Fauci.Support our journalism. Subscribe today.arrow-rightBut the public drama doesn\u2019t seem to be threatening the behind-the-scenes effort Fauci is overseeing to find a coronavirus vaccine.As head of the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Disease, Fauci is closely involved with vaccine development undertaken by biotech company Moderna. The company, one of two with grants from the U.S. government to speed up vaccine development, announced yesterday it is ready to start the final stage of clinical trials by the end of July.\u00a0\u201cNo matter how you slice this, this is good news,\u201d Fauci told the Associated Press.Moderna plans to test its vaccine on 30,000 people, many of them located in coronavirus hot spots around the world. While at least 21 vaccine candidates are currently in clinical trials, the company is the furthest along in testing its shots.There\u2019s no sign the Trump administration's public criticism of Fauci is slowing vaccine development down behind the scenes.The White House\u2019s recent treatment of Fauci generated a lot of buzz this week, especially after my colleagues Yasmeen Abutaleb, Josh Dawsey and Laurie McGinley published a story reporting that his relationship with the president has sharply deteriorated and the two haven\u2019t spoken since early June.During a Fox News interview last week with Sean Hannity, Trump said Fauci \u201cis a nice man, but he\u2019s made a lot of mistakes.\u201d When Greta Van Susteren asked him about Fauci\u2019s assessment that the country was not in a good place, Trump said flatly: \u201cI disagree with him.\u201dThe most pointed attack on Fauci by an administration official came in a USA Today op-ed out last night, in which Trump trade adviser Peter Navarro wrote that Fauci \u201chas been wrong about everything I have interacted with him on.\u201d Navarro criticized Fauci for opposing Trump\u2019s move in January to block flights from China and some early statements Fauci made downplaying the virus \u2013 even though many health experts said similar things at the time.ADADConservative economist and Trump ally Stephen Moore told the Daily Beast that he's working on a policy memo going after Fauci, both for past statements he made about the pandemic and his decades of work at NIAID. The memo is currently entitled \u201cDr. Wrong,\u201d Moore said.But Fauci remains on the executive committee of a public-private partnership launched in April to speed up development of vaccines and treatment options for covid-19 patients. He told me in an interview last month that he is still meeting twice a week with other coronavirus task force members, and texting and emailing with them more frequently than that.\u201cI think for many different reasons the president has taken that posture, but behind the scenes there is no implication on Fauci\u2019s reputation or his effectiveness,\u201d said Esther Krofah, executive director of FasterCures, a center of the Santa Monica, Calif.-based Milken Institute.ADAD\u201cFauci\u00a0is very much in the mix,\u201d she added. \u201cI don\u2019t suspect he will move out of any of those leadership discussions.\u201dFauci also has many defenders.Health professionals and politicians leaped to his defense this week. Some noted Fauci was merely echoing the best scientific knowledge available at the time, while others pointed to his storied career, which includes many years of leading HIV research.CNN reporter Andrew Kaczynski:Zeke Emanuel, a vice provost at the University of Pennsylvania:\u201cReports of a campaign to discredit and diminish the role of Dr. Fauci at this perilous moment are disturbing,\u201d said Thomas File, president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America.ADJudith Feinberg, chair of the HIV Medicine Association, also said Fauci\u2019s voice needs to be \u201camplified, not silenced, if we are going to get control of the covid-19 pandemic.\u201dADHoward Bauchner, editor of the Journal of the American Medical Association, called the attacks on Fauci \u201cunseemly and unfair.\u201dThey \u201creveal a lack of commitment to the health and well-being of all Americans, and ultimately will be counterproductive and potentially destructive,\u201d he wrote.Asked about the reports of the White House shutting out Fauci, Sen. Lindsay O. Graham (R-S.C.) told reporters yesterday that undermining Fauci \u201cis not going to be productive, quite frankly.\u201d\u201cHas he been right all the time? No. We don\u2019t have a Dr. Fauci problem. We need to be focusing on doing things that get us where we need to go,\u201d Graham said. \u201cSo I have all the respect in the world for Dr. Fauci.\u201dNone of this guarantees Fauci and others will be able to deliver on Trump's promised time-frame of early next year.While Moderna's trial hasn't yet hit any major glitches, there's no guarantee it will be able to get a shot licensed by the Food and Drug Administration by early 2021, as Trump has promised. Most vaccines takes years, not months, to develop. And when a vaccine is ready, there will be further challenges around widely distributing the shots.ADADThere are certainly some naysayers, including Merck CEO Kenneth Frazier. In an interview yesterday for Harvard Business School, Frazier said officials are doing a \u201cgrave disservice\u201d to the public by talking up the potential for vaccines quickly, noting the major obstacles to such quick development.\u201cWhat worries me the most is that the public is so hungry, is so desperate to go back to normalcy, that they are pushing us to move things faster and faster,\u201d Frazier said. \u201cUltimately, if you are going to use a vaccine in billions of people, you\u2019d better know what that vaccine does.\u201d\u00a0Ahh, oof and ouchAHH: Scientists are applying knowledge from their search for an HIV vaccine to the search for a coronavirus vaccine.Some of the efforts are led by the same researchers who have spent years looking for a cure for AIDS. \u201cThose decades of research on HIV have taught scientists an enormous amount about the immune system, honed vaccine technologies now being repurposed against the coronavirus and created a worldwide infrastructure of clinical trial networks that can be pivoted from HIV to the pathogen that causes the disease covid-19,\u201d Carolyn Y. Johnson and Lenny Bernstein report.\u00a0\u201cLaboratories, testing sites and recruitment networks that were rushed into action against the coronavirus exist because of the enormous amount of money spent on HIV,\" they add. \"Equipment and expertise are in place. Infection control has been upgraded. Regulators are engaged.\u201d\u00a0\u201cThe investment in HIV research has made the response to covid-19 possible,\u201d Dan H. Barouch, director of the Center for Virology and Vaccine Research at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, told Carolyn and Lenny.ADADGovernments and private firms have pledged billions of dollars in the search for a vaccine. There are 160 vaccines currently under development, including the 21 that are being evaluated in clinical settings.\u00a0Scientists are seeing some key differences between how HIV and the coronavirus work, making them hopeful a covid-19 vaccine will be successful.\u201cScience is gambling that one or more of those efforts will yield and deploy a coronavirus vaccine within 12 to 18 months,\" our colleagues write. \u201cResearchers are heartened by the key differences between the viruses. HIV integrates itself into the body\u2019s cells, which means a vaccine has to start working immediately to rout it. People\u2019s immune systems are not able to naturally defeat HIV, making a vaccine even more difficult to create. And it mutates much more quickly than the novel coronavirus.\u201dOOF: The federal stockpile of protective equipment is dwindling.That means states, hospitals and nursing homes in need of critical supplies \u2014 some of which have reported shortages \u2014 may not be able to rely on the federal government for help, NBC News\u2019s Jonathan Allen and Cyrus Farivar report.\u00a0\u201cFor example, the Strategic National Stockpile and the Federal Emergency Management Agency have fewer than 900,000 gloves in reserve after shipping 82.7 million of them \u2014 or just 30 percent of the amount requested by state, local and tribal governments \u2014 since the COVID-19 crisis began, according to figures compiled Sunday by Health and Human Services Department officials for senior leaders of the interagency coronavirus task force effort,\u201d they write.\u00a0ADADRear Adm. John Polowczyk, the chief supply chain official for the White House coronavirus task force, insisted the situation is \u201cjust not that dire\" \u2013 even as several states reinstitute lockdowns and others move to shut down bars as cases and deaths surge.\u201cI\u2019m not going to pretend to tell you that supply and demand are perfectly aligned again, because there is still some residual hunting and pecking for a few things,\u201d Polowczyk said. \u201cBut supply and demand back orders are trending typically down, and we're fundamentally in a volume place differently than we were in, say, March and then very early April.\"OUCH: A former employee at a Veterans Affairs hospital admitted to injecting elderly patients with lethal doses of insulin.\u00a0Reta Mays, who was a nursing assistant at the facility in West Virginia, admitted in federal court to the killing spree that occurred in 2017 and 2018, pleading guilty to second-degree murder in the deaths of seven veterans, and also to the intent to murder an eighth veteran who later died.\u00a0\u201cAfter a two-year investigation into a pattern of suspicious deaths that took the hospital almost a year to detect, Mays, who denied any wrongdoing in multiple interviews with investigators, told a federal judge she preyed on some of the country\u2019s most vulnerable service members,\u201d Lisa Rein and Molly Born report.\u00a0ADAD\u201cMays, a 46-year-old Army veteran hired by the Louis A. Johnson Medical Center in 2015 with no certification or license to care for patients, chose victims admitted to the hospital from July 2017 through June 2018 with heart conditions, strokes, cancer. A few had mild diabetes. But they were not about to die, court documents show.\u201d\u00a0Mays tended to the patients, taking their vital signs and glucose levels during late-night shifts. She injected the veterans in the middle of the night with insulin she was not authorized to administer.\u00a0\u201cThe hospital has come under fire for leaving its insulin supplies so easily accessible and for failing to detect the suspicious pattern of the deaths, issues that VA Inspector General Michael Missal said would be addressed in an upcoming report on its operations,\" our colleagues add.Trump chided Los Angeles schools and others for deciding not to reopen their doors to students in the fall.\u00a0\u201cI would tell parents and teachers that you should find yourself a new person, whoever\u2019s in charge of that decision,\u201d Trump said in an interview with CBS News when asked about his message to parents and teachers. \u201cBecause it\u2019s a terrible decision, because children and parents are dying from that trauma, too.\u201d\u201cMothers can\u2019t go to work, because all of a sudden they have to stay home and watch their child \u2014 and fathers,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening \u2014 you know, there\u2019s a tremendous strain on that whole side of the equation.\u201dAgency effortsCenters for Disease Control and Prevention Director Robert Redfield says the U.S. could get the spread \u201cunder control\u201d within a month or two if everyone wore face coverings.\u00a0\u201cLike herd immunity with vaccines, the more individuals wear cloth face coverings in public places where they may be close together, the more the entire community is protected,\u201d Redfield and a pair of colleagues wrote in an editorial published yesterday in the Journal of the American Medical Association.In a live webcast, Redfield added: \u201cIf we could get everybody to wear a mask right now, I really think in the next four, six, eight weeks, we could bring this epidemic under control.\u201d\u201cThe \u2018if,\u2019 of course, has been the problem. Because masking or refusing to mask has become a political statement, only 62% of Americans said in April that they did so (the CDC recommended the practice on April 3); in May, 76% said they did, according to another MMWR study,\u201d Stat News\u2019s Sharon Begley reports. \u201cThe CDC advice followed weeks of mixed and contradictory messaging, and even after it was issued, President Trump and other national leaders fell well short of endorsing face coverings.\u201dADADRedfield also warned the fall and winter would be \u201cone of the most difficult times that we have experienced in American public health.\u201d\u00a0\u201cRedfield has repeatedly warned that the co-occurrence of the coronavirus pandemic and the flu season in the fall and winter is likely to compound the public health crisis,\u201d Meryl Kornfield writes for The Post\u2019s live blog. Redfield urged Americans to get a flu shot to avoid overtaxing the health system.\u00a0\u201cKeeping the health-care system from being overstretched, I think, is really important, and the degree we are able to do that will define how well we get through the fall and winter,\u201d he added.A new report from the CDC says most Americans started covering their faces in public within days of the federal recommendation.\u00a0\u201cThe findings, based on two Internet surveys of about 500 adults each, suggest quick adoption of a measure that\u2019s become politicized and drawn vocal pushback in some communities,\u201d Hannah Knowles writes for The Post\u2019s live blog.\u00a0\u201cWhen the first survey cited by the CDC was conducted April 7 through 9, about 62 percent of people who said they left their home in the past week said they had used a cloth face covering.

Subscribe today.arrow-rightBut the public drama doesn\u2019t seem to be threatening the behind-the-scenes effort Fauci is overseeing to find a coronavirus vaccine.As head of the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Disease, Fauci is closely involved with vaccine development undertaken by biotech company Moderna. The company, one of two with grants from the U.S. government to speed up vaccine development, announced yesterday it is ready to start the final stage of clinical trials by the end of July.\u00a0\u201cNo matter how you slice this, this is good news,\u201d Fauci told the Associated Press.Moderna plans to test its vaccine on 30,000 people, many of them located in coronavirus hot spots around the world. While at least 21 vaccine candidates are currently in clinical trials, the company is the furthest along in testing its shots.There\u2019s no sign the Trump administration's public criticism of Fauci is slowing vaccine development down behind the scenes.The White House\u2019s recent treatment of Fauci generated a lot of buzz this week, especially after my colleagues Yasmeen Abutaleb, Josh Dawsey and Laurie McGinley published a story reporting that his relationship with the president has sharply deteriorated and the two haven\u2019t spoken since early June.During a Fox News interview last week with Sean Hannity, Trump said Fauci \u201cis a nice man, but he\u2019s made a lot of mistakes.\u201d When Greta Van Susteren asked him about Fauci\u2019s assessment that the country was not in a good place, Trump said flatly: \u201cI disagree with him.\u201dThe most pointed attack on Fauci by an administration official came in a USA Today op-ed out last night, in which Trump trade adviser Peter Navarro wrote that Fauci \u201chas been wrong about everything I have interacted with him on.\u201d Navarro criticized Fauci for opposing Trump\u2019s move in January to block flights from China and some early statements Fauci made downplaying the virus \u2013 even though many health experts said similar things at the time.ADADConservative economist and Trump ally Stephen Moore told the Daily Beast that he's working on a policy memo going after Fauci, both for past statements he made about the pandemic and his decades of work at NIAID. The memo is currently entitled \u201cDr. Wrong,\u201d Moore said.But Fauci remains on the executive committee of a public-private partnership launched in April to speed up development of vaccines and treatment options for covid-19 patients. He told me in an interview last month that he is still meeting twice a week with other coronavirus task force members, and texting and emailing with them more frequently than that.\u201cI think for many different reasons the president has taken that posture, but behind the scenes there is no implication on Fauci\u2019s reputation or his effectiveness,\u201d said Esther Krofah, executive director of FasterCures, a center of the Santa Monica, Calif.-based Milken Institute.ADAD\u201cFauci\u00a0is very much in the mix,\u201d she added. \u201cI don\u2019t suspect he will move out of any of those leadership discussions.\u201dFauci also has many defenders.Health professionals and politicians leaped to his defense this week. Some noted Fauci was merely echoing the best scientific knowledge available at the time, while others pointed to his storied career, which includes many years of leading HIV research.CNN reporter Andrew Kaczynski:Zeke Emanuel, a vice provost at the University of Pennsylvania:\u201cReports of a campaign to discredit and diminish the role of Dr. Fauci at this perilous moment are disturbing,\u201d said Thomas File, president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America.ADJudith Feinberg, chair of the HIV Medicine Association, also said Fauci\u2019s voice needs to be \u201camplified, not silenced, if we are going to get control of the covid-19 pandemic.\u201dADHoward Bauchner, editor of the Journal of the American Medical Association, called the attacks on Fauci \u201cunseemly and unfair.\u201dThey \u201creveal a lack of commitment to the health and well-being of all Americans, and ultimately will be counterproductive and potentially destructive,\u201d he wrote.Asked about the reports of the White House shutting out Fauci, Sen. Lindsay O. Graham (R-S.C.) told reporters yesterday that undermining Fauci \u201cis not going to be productive, quite frankly.\u201d\u201cHas he been right all the time? No. We don\u2019t have a Dr. Fauci problem. We need to be focusing on doing things that get us where we need to go,\u201d Graham said. \u201cSo I have all the respect in the world for Dr. Fauci.\u201dNone of this guarantees Fauci and others will be able to deliver on Trump's promised time-frame of early next year.While Moderna's trial hasn't yet hit any major glitches, there's no guarantee it will be able to get a shot licensed by the Food and Drug Administration by early 2021, as Trump has promised. Most vaccines takes years, not months, to develop. And when a vaccine is ready, there will be further challenges around widely distributing the shots.ADADThere are certainly some naysayers, including Merck CEO Kenneth Frazier. In an interview yesterday for Harvard Business School, Frazier said officials are doing a \u201cgrave disservice\u201d to the public by talking up the potential for vaccines quickly, noting the major obstacles to such quick development.\u201cWhat worries me the most is that the public is so hungry, is so desperate to go back to normalcy, that they are pushing us to move things faster and faster,\u201d Frazier said. \u201cUltimately, if you are going to use a vaccine in billions of people, you\u2019d better know what that vaccine does.\u201d\u00a0Ahh, oof and ouchAHH: Scientists are applying knowledge from their search for an HIV vaccine to the search for a coronavirus vaccine.Some of the efforts are led by the same researchers who have spent years looking for a cure for AIDS. \u201cThose decades of research on HIV have taught scientists an enormous amount about the immune system, honed vaccine technologies now being repurposed against the coronavirus and created a worldwide infrastructure of clinical trial networks that can be pivoted from HIV to the pathogen that causes the disease covid-19,\u201d Carolyn Y. Johnson and Lenny Bernstein report.\u00a0\u201cLaboratories, testing sites and recruitment networks that were rushed into action against the coronavirus exist because of the enormous amount of money spent on HIV,\" they add. \"Equipment and expertise are in place. Infection control has been upgraded. Regulators are engaged.\u201d\u00a0\u201cThe investment in HIV research has made the response to covid-19 possible,\u201d Dan H. Barouch, director of the Center for Virology and Vaccine Research at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, told Carolyn and Lenny.ADADGovernments and private firms have pledged billions of dollars in the search for a vaccine. There are 160 vaccines currently under development, including the 21 that are being evaluated in clinical settings.\u00a0Scientists are seeing some key differences between how HIV and the coronavirus work, making them hopeful a covid-19 vaccine will be successful.\u201cScience is gambling that one or more of those efforts will yield and deploy a coronavirus vaccine within 12 to 18 months,\" our colleagues write. \u201cResearchers are heartened by the key differences between the viruses. HIV integrates itself into the body\u2019s cells, which means a vaccine has to start working immediately to rout it. People\u2019s immune systems are not able to naturally defeat HIV, making a vaccine even more difficult to create. And it mutates much more quickly than the novel coronavirus.\u201dOOF: The federal stockpile of protective equipment is dwindling.That means states, hospitals and nursing homes in need of critical supplies \u2014 some of which have reported shortages \u2014 may not be able to rely on the federal government for help, NBC News\u2019s Jonathan Allen and Cyrus Farivar report.\u00a0\u201cFor example, the Strategic National Stockpile and the Federal Emergency Management Agency have fewer than 900,000 gloves in reserve after shipping 82.7 million of them \u2014 or just 30 percent of the amount requested by state, local and tribal governments \u2014 since the COVID-19 crisis began, according to figures compiled Sunday by Health and Human Services Department officials for senior leaders of the interagency coronavirus task force effort,\u201d they write.\u00a0ADADRear Adm. John Polowczyk, the chief supply chain official for the White House coronavirus task force, insisted the situation is \u201cjust not that dire\" \u2013 even as several states reinstitute lockdowns and others move to shut down bars as cases and deaths surge.\u201cI\u2019m not going to pretend to tell you that supply and demand are perfectly aligned again, because there is still some residual hunting and pecking for a few things,\u201d Polowczyk said. \u201cBut supply and demand back orders are trending typically down, and we're fundamentally in a volume place differently than we were in, say, March and then very early April.\"OUCH: A former employee at a Veterans Affairs hospital admitted to injecting elderly patients with lethal doses of insulin.\u00a0Reta Mays, who was a nursing assistant at the facility in West Virginia, admitted in federal court to the killing spree that occurred in 2017 and 2018, pleading guilty to second-degree murder in the deaths of seven veterans, and also to the intent to murder an eighth veteran who later died.\u00a0\u201cAfter a two-year investigation into a pattern of suspicious deaths that took the hospital almost a year to detect, Mays, who denied any wrongdoing in multiple interviews with investigators, told a federal judge she preyed on some of the country\u2019s most vulnerable service members,\u201d Lisa Rein and Molly Born report.\u00a0ADAD\u201cMays, a 46-year-old Army veteran hired by the Louis A. Johnson Medical Center in 2015 with no certification or license to care for patients, chose victims admitted to the hospital from July 2017 through June 2018 with heart conditions, strokes, cancer. A few had mild diabetes. But they were not about to die, court documents show.\u201d\u00a0Mays tended to the patients, taking their vital signs and glucose levels during late-night shifts. She injected the veterans in the middle of the night with insulin she was not authorized to administer.\u00a0\u201cThe hospital has come under fire for leaving its insulin supplies so easily accessible and for failing to detect the suspicious pattern of the deaths, issues that VA Inspector General Michael Missal said would be addressed in an upcoming report on its operations,\" our colleagues add.Trump chided Los Angeles schools and others for deciding not to reopen their doors to students in the fall.\u00a0\u201cI would tell parents and teachers that you should find yourself a new person, whoever\u2019s in charge of that decision,\u201d Trump said in an interview with CBS News when asked about his message to parents and teachers. \u201cBecause it\u2019s a terrible decision, because children and parents are dying from that trauma, too.\u201d\u201cMothers can\u2019t go to work, because all of a sudden they have to stay home and watch their child \u2014 and fathers,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening \u2014 you know, there\u2019s a tremendous strain on that whole side of the equation.\u201dAgency effortsCenters for Disease Control and Prevention Director Robert Redfield says the U.S. could get the spread \u201cunder control\u201d within a month or two if everyone wore face coverings.\u00a0\u201cLike herd immunity with vaccines, the more individuals wear cloth face coverings in public places where they may be close together, the more the entire community is protected,\u201d Redfield and a pair of colleagues wrote in an editorial published yesterday in the Journal of the American Medical Association.In a live webcast, Redfield added: \u201cIf we could get everybody to wear a mask right now, I really think in the next four, six, eight weeks, we could bring this epidemic under control.\u201d\u201cThe \u2018if,\u2019 of course, has been the problem. Because masking or refusing to mask has become a political statement, only 62% of Americans said in April that they did so (the CDC recommended the practice on April 3); in May, 76% said they did, according to another MMWR study,\u201d Stat News\u2019s Sharon Begley reports. \u201cThe CDC advice followed weeks of mixed and contradictory messaging, and even after it was issued, President Trump and other national leaders fell well short of endorsing face coverings.\u201dADADRedfield also warned the fall and winter would be \u201cone of the most difficult times that we have experienced in American public health.\u201d\u00a0\u201cRedfield has repeatedly warned that the co-occurrence of the coronavirus pandemic and the flu season in the fall and winter is likely to compound the public health crisis,\u201d Meryl Kornfield writes for The Post\u2019s live blog. Redfield urged Americans to get a flu shot to avoid overtaxing the health system.\u00a0\u201cKeeping the health-care system from being overstretched, I think, is really important, and the degree we are able to do that will define how well we get through the fall and winter,\u201d he added.A new report from the CDC says most Americans started covering their faces in public within days of the federal recommendation.\u00a0\u201cThe findings, based on two Internet surveys of about 500 adults each, suggest quick adoption of a measure that\u2019s become politicized and drawn vocal pushback in some communities,\u201d Hannah Knowles writes for The Post\u2019s live blog.\u00a0\u201cWhen the first survey cited by the CDC was conducted April 7 through 9, about 62 percent of people who said they left their home in the past week said they had used a cloth face covering. A month later, face covering use increased and was \u2018primarily associated\u2019 with three demographic groups, the CDC report states. Usage jumped from about 54 percent to 75 percent among non-Hispanic white people; from about 37 percent to 79 percent among people older than 65; and from about 44 percent to 79 percent among residents of the Midwest.\u201d\u00a0The ongoing debate about reopening schoolsCoronavirus latestHere are a few more stories to catch up on this morningAround the world:\u00a0The surge in coronavirus cases around the world is being led by poorer nations, including areas in Latin America, the Middle East, South Asia and Africa. \u201cAnd then there\u2019s the United States, which leads the world in new cases and, as with many nations that possess far fewer resources, has shown no sign of being able to regain control,\u201d Griff Witte, Mary Beth Sheridan, Joanna Slater and Liz Sly report.The fallout:Elective surgeries and procedures have been put on pause once again in many areas where coronavirus cases are seeing a resurgence.

Subscribe today.arrow-rightBeing barred from another country is not something that Americans are familiar with. For centuries, we have been the ones demonizing foreigners as carriers of infectious disease. And we have been the ones banning immigrants in the name of protecting Americans\u2019 public health. But with coronavirus cases surging in our communities, we must face the hard truth that we are no longer welcome in many places around the world.This isn\u2019t the way it was supposed to be. Foreigners bring disease to the United States, our politicians have long told us. So if we keep out immigrants, we keep out disease, too. It\u2019s like protecting our borders with those disinfectant wipes that claim to kill 99.9 percent of germs, viruses and bacteria. President Trump clearly believes this. He has repeatedly credited his administration\u2019s Jan. 31 travel ban prohibiting any non-U.S. resident coming from China for saving \u201cmillions of U.S. lives.\u201d In February and March, the president justified his preexisting plan for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border \u201cto keep the infection and those carrying the infection from entering our country.\u201dTrump has spread more hatred of immigrants than any American in historyIt\u2019s easy to see why Trump might think this way. After all, our history of tying foreigners to disease has deep roots. In 1793, Germans were blamed for bringing yellow fever, often called the \u201cGerman flu,\u201d into the country. In Philadelphia, they were quarantined in a \u201cpesthouse\u201d on Province Island. In 1832 and 1849, the Irish were tied to cholera outbreaks in New York City. San Francisco public health officials claimed that Chinese immigrants brought numerous dangerous diseases such as smallpox, bubonic plague and leprosy into the country. Tuberculosis was known as a \u201cJewish disease.\u201d Newspapers identified Italian immigrants as the source of the polio epidemic that raged along the East Coast during the summer of 1916. Mexicans were described as living in \u201cfilth, disease, [and] squalor\u201d and were charged with bringing typhus, plague and smallpox into the United States.ADADPublic health, xenophobia and racism worked together to form a toxic brew throughout U.S. history. In the late 19th century, we began our long practice of banning immigrants on medical grounds. The 1891 Immigration Act allowed the U.S. government to deny entry to any foreigner \u201csuffering from a loathsome or a dangerous contagious disease,\u201d such as trachoma, favus, venereal disease, parasitic infection or tuberculosis. By 1903, the U.S. Public Health Service included a new category of excludable diseases and conditions that rendered the immigrant \u201clikely to become a public charge\u201d unable to support themselves.Some of these \u201cdefects\u201d included pregnancy, \u201cpoor physique,\u201d \u201cnervous affections,\u201d deformities, varicose veins and poor eyesight. Over the years, more diseases and conditions were added to the government\u2019s no-entry list. Most were chronic, mental or moral conditions, such as \u201cfeeblemindedness\u201d and \u201cconstitutional psychopathic inferiority,\u201d a coded reference to those engaged in allegedly perverse or degenerate sexual activity or behavior.These expanded lists meant the United States was able to ban more and more immigrants, especially those considered to be racially undesirable and inferior such as Asians, southern and eastern Europeans, and Mexicans. By 1915, 69 percent of immigrants blocked from entry had been shut out on medical grounds. In the 1920s, discriminatory national-origins quotas were put in place to further restrict immigration from southern, eastern and central Europe and exclude Asians. The U.S. Border Patrol was established.Trump\u2019s xenophobia is an American tradition \u2014 but it doesn\u2019t have to beU.S. lawmakers continued to associate foreigners with dangerous germs, behavior and ideas throughout the 20th century. In 1987, AIDS was added to the list of excludable diseases. Individuals seeking refugee status were tested for HIV, and asylum seekers wishing to stay longer than one year in the United States had to submit to an HIV test. As a disease category, HIV was particularly associated with groups considered sexually deviant (gay people) and racially undesirable (Haitians and Africans). This association led to racist immigration policies such as the quarantining of HIV-positive Haitian immigrants at the U.S. Marine base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, in the 1990s. In 1993, President Bill Clinton signed the National Institutes of Health Revitalization Act, which listed HIV infection as a \u201ccommunicable disease of public health significance\u201d and banned HIV-positive visiting tourists and foreigners seeking to live in this country. The ban on such foreigners would not be lifted until 2009.ADADThe link between xenophobia and disease remains strong today. Some, like Trump, blame China for the novel coronavirus and consistently use racist language like \u201cthe Chinese virus\u201d and \u201ckung flu\u201d to refer to it. Others, like Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), claim that the virus was manufactured in laboratories in Wuhan.Trump\u2019s White House is guilty of exactly what it accuses China of doingAs in the past, xenophobia is also driving new immigration policies. In just a few months, the Trump administration has put in place the most sweeping set of immigration restrictions in U.S. history. Not even during the flu pandemic of 1918 and 1919, the Great Depression or both world wars has the United States closed its borders to immigration in the way it is doing today. Immigration has ground to a halt. Refugee admissions have been suspended indefinitely. Asylum has summarily been ended at the U.S.-Mexico border. Restrictions ban the entry of almost every type of immigrant seeking to settle in the United States permanently, including those trying to reunite with families and skilled workers. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has just announced a rule requiring international students to leave the country if their school will be fully online this fall. Initially announced as temporary measures, some of these policies have already been extended indefinitely.Of course, the United States is far from alone in implementing travel bans, border closures and other restrictions on mobility during the pandemic \u2014 as the orders that the E.U. just lifted show. The Migration Policy Institute identified 130 countries that had put some kind of limits in place by March. Still, the United States was the first and only country also to justify immigration restrictions to protect the jobs of its workers, a policy that has received its fair share of criticism from business leaders. And it is now clear that the Trump administration is using the coronavirus pandemic to force through extreme policies that have long been part of its broader anti-immigrant agenda.Meanwhile, within our borders, the virus is spreading at an alarming and devastating rate, and it\u2019s not because of immigration. A lack of widespread testing and contact tracing combined with botched reopenings and some Americans\u2019 reluctance to wear masks have hampered efforts to control the infection. The United States has the highest number of confirmed coronavirus cases (nearly 3 million) in the world and is setting daily records for new infections.The E.U. is right to ban Americans.

Indeed, the only limitation was Trump\u2019s, and his staff\u2019s, imaginations.ADPrevious incumbents have used the \u201cRose Garden strategy\u201d \u2014 that is, using the trappings of the presidency to campaign for reelection \u2014 but Trump\u2019s reinterpretation of that approach was downright bizarre. After his attempt at a comeback rally in Tulsa turned into a disaster, and he canceled his New Hampshire rally because of a rainstorm on a perfectly dry evening, Trump seems to have decided to hold campaign rallies in the Rose Garden, with the White House press corps as captive audience.ADIn the same week Trump reached the milestone of 20,000 false or misleading statements, as documented by The Post\u2019s Fact Checker, the president seemed determined to recite them all in a single appearance. To call it stream-of-consciousness is too serene: Trump\u2019s brain was shooting the rapids, hitting rocks, tumbling down falls.He started with an announcement about Hong Kong; bounced to Biden\u2019s infrastructure plan; swerved to the pandemic; careened to the swine flu of 2009; lurched to Ukraine and Burisma (\u201cWhere is Hunter?\u201d); wobbled into the stock market; detoured to \u201cAOC\u201d (\u201ca young woman not talented in many ways\"), \u201cBernie\" and Nancy Pelosi; floated into Maine fisheries; listed into the \u201ctremendous fraud\u201d of mail-in voting (\u201ca mailman was indicted someplace\u201d); and took on water with a claim about \u201ccriminals pouring into our country\u201d \u2014 from Europe.ADEvery now and again, his thoughts would return to the paper in front of him, and he would read some other fantastic allegation against Biden, so absurd it seemed to surprise even Trump. \u201cOh, I didn\u2019t notice that,\u201d he said, reading an allegation that Biden has plans to rejoin the Paris climate agreement but make it \u201cworse than it was.\u201dAD\u201cWe did this very quickly,\u201d Trump explained at one point as he read through the imaginary Biden agenda.Who would have guessed?Trump\u2019s instability seemed to have been set off by Biden himself, who earlier Tuesday did the very opposite of what Trump did: He delivered a reasoned and measured speech about his infrastructure plans, hewing closely to the teleprompter and taking no questions, and eschewing liberal favorites from the Green New Deal. \u201cLook, these aren\u2019t pie-in-the-sky dreams,\u201d Biden said. \u201cThese are actionable policies.\u201dADConfronted with an opponent who is conspicuously reasonable, Trump has pretended he is running against somebody else. He has tried to brand Biden as senile and corrupt, and his allies have tried to brand the presumptive Democratic nominee a sexual predator and a pedophile.AD\u201cJoe Biden\u2019s entire career has been a gift to the Chinese Communist Party,\u201d Trump alleged.Biden \u201cnever did anything but make very bad decisions.\u201d\u201cLast Independence Day, Biden attacked the United States.\u201d\u201cBiden is pushing a platform that would demolish the U.S. economy.\u201d\u201cHe wants to kill American energy!\u201dHe has \u201cthe most extreme platform of any major party nominee by far in American history.\u201dAD\u201cIt\u2019s worse than Bernie\u2019s platform it\u2019s gone so far right,\u201d Trump said, mixing up his directions.Maybe some in the MAGA crowd will believe that. They\u2019ll also believe that \u201cthousands of people in New York died because of poor management\u201d by Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) and that Trump\u2019s decision to stop flights from China saved \u201c2 to 3 million lives\u201d (\u201ca number that we\u2019re actually working on\u201d).Asked whether his extraordinary Rose Garden tirade was a sign that he thinks he might lose, Trump\u2019s answer included references to his electoral college win in 2016 and the fact that \"we\u2019re making swabs [in] a beautiful big new factory.\u201dADBeautiful, that is, until Biden takes away all its windows.Sign up to receive my columns in your inbox as soon as they\u2019re published.Read more:The Post\u2019s View: With Trump\u2019s heedless approach to the pandemic, children will pay an even higher priceDavid Ignatius: Trump\u2019s \u2018law and order\u2019 is a code for maintaining personal powerMax Boot: The credibility gap between Mike Pompeo\u2019s pronouncements and Trump\u2019s realityDavid Von Drehle: Trump has killed satire", "comment": "6.5k Comments", "topic": "Opinions"}, {"cover": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/VIOB5ZF75YI6VCIINCRLT2XJ4A.jpghttps://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/VIOB5ZF75YI6VCIINCRLT2XJ4A.jpg", "title": "Melbourne Locked Down; Beijing Reaches Milestone: Virus Update", "date": "Jul 7, 2020", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/on-small-business/melbourne-locked-down-beijing-reaches-milestone-virus-update/2020/07/06/c0a31de8-bfee-11ea-8908-68a2b9eae9e0_story.html", "keyword": "China and the world order", "website": "the Washington Post", "author": "", "content": "The virus set records across the U.S., with Texas\u2019s daily cases, Arizona\u2019s deaths and California\u2019s hospitalizations hitting new highs.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s government is trying to persuade schools to return to normal, amid concerns that pupils are falling behind in their education and parents are unable to work effectively while educating their children.Botswana President Quarantines After Aide Tests Positive (7:18 a.m. NY))Botswana President Mokgweetsi Masisi started 14 days of quarantine after an \u201cofficial closely serving him\u201d tested positive for coronavirus, according to a statement emailed by the Office of the President.Airbnb Restricts Bookings for Some U.S. Guests Under 25 (7:12 a.m. NY)Airbnb Inc. will restrict guests under the age of 25 with less then three positive reviews from booking entire home listings that are close to where they live, the company said in a statement. The measure will support \u201csafe and responsible\u201d travel in the U.S. and follows a similar initiative in Canada that was implemented earlier this year.EU Seeks to Secure Remdesivir Doses (7:01 a.m. NY)The European Union is in negotiations with Gilead on the possibility of reserving a \u201csufficient number of doses\u201d of remdesivir for the bloc\u2019s member states, a European CommissionGerman Parliament Backs $246-Billion Debt Binge to Spur Growth (6:10 a.m. NY)Germany\u2019s lower house of parliament approved additional borrowing that will raise new debt this year to 218 billion euros ($246 billion) to fund spending to put the economy back on track.The Bundestag also backed the government\u2019s stimulus package designed to boost long-term competitiveness and help achieve climate targets, as the country seeks to emerge from its worst recession since World War II.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P.", "comment": "1 Comments", "topic": "On Small Business"}, {"cover": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/77JVNAGFEYI6VD76G4V6RWBCTA.jpghttps://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/77JVNAGFEYI6VD76G4V6RWBCTA.jpg", "title": "Canada\u2019s coronavirus performance hasn\u2019t been perfect.

Most Canadians don\u2019t.He has a point. Canada\u2019s response to the pandemic hasn\u2019t been perfect \u2014 Quebec and Ontario suffered substantial outbreaks, authorities enlisted soldiers to help in hard-hit long-term care facilities, and Mexico was so concerned about conditions on farms that it threatened to hold back its migrant workers.ADADStill, the country has fared far better than the United States. The close allies share similar connections to initial hot spots in China and Europe, and they confirmed their first cases within a week of each other in January. But the United States has since reported more than three times as many total infections per capita, and nearly twice as many deaths.Canadians have taken note. The two countries agreed to close their shared border to nonessential travel in March. Surveys here show that the closure, while economically painful, continues to enjoy wide public support.To keep coronavirus out, Canada\u2019s smallest province kept the rest of the country away. Now outsiders are returning.\u201cThere\u2019s no smugness,\u201d said Susy Hota, medical director of infection prevention and control at Toronto\u2019s University Health Network. \u201cWe look at what\u2019s happening to our neighbor in the south and all of us are just feeling really bad about it.\u201dADADAnalysts point to several reasons for the divergent outcomes.Canada has the natural advantage of geography: It has less than one-ninth the United States\u2019 population. Canadians aren\u2019t evenly distributed \u2014 two-thirds of them live within 62\u00a0miles of the U.S. border \u2014 but no city here is as densely populated as, say, New York City.\u201cWe have that geographic distribution between major centers,\u201d said Jason Kindrachuk, a virologist at the University of Manitoba. \u201cUndoubtedly, it has played a role.\u201dBut the country has also performed better at critical moments. In the early stages of the pandemic, Canada was able to ramp up testing more quickly than the United States, enabling it to better isolate the sick, trace contacts and limit spread.Efforts in the United States were hindered in part by a flawed test.Canada\u2019s early success in testing would not last. Several provinces have struggled to meet testing targets and clear backlogs, leaving officials flying blind when trying to identify outbreaks or to rapidly trace contacts.ADADZain Chagla, an infectious-diseases physician at St. Joseph\u2019s Healthcare Hamilton, said some hospitals have turned away patients with coronavirus symptoms for lack of tests. The United States now tests more people per capita than Canada.Canadian provinces allow locked-down households to pair up \u2014 threatening hurt feelings all aroundThe Canadian people have been less divided and more disciplined. Some provinces and territories could have locked down sooner, analysts say, but once measures were announced, they were strict, broadly uniform and widely followed.\u201cIt was completely unexpected,\u201d said Gary Kobinger, director of the Research Center on Infectious Diseases at Quebec\u2019s Laval University. \u201cI thought that people would not accept to stay home. .\u2009.\u2009. This also helped.\u201dSome provinces and territories, like some U.S. states, moved early to limit travel from other parts of the country and mandate quarantines. Michael Gardam, chief of staff at Toronto\u2019s Humber River Hospital, said provinces have mostly been \u201cappropriately cautious\u201d when easing restrictions, in contrast to those states that never imposed closures or stay-at-home orders or loosened controls prematurely.ADADResearchers at the University of Toronto studying reopenings found that restrictions in Yukon, a northern territory that had 11 coronavirus cases and no deaths, are more stringent than those in Texas, where hospitalizations are surging.Canada\u2019s Nunavut: A vast territory with few people \u2014 and no coronavirusGerald Evans, a professor of medicine at Queens University in Kingston, Ontario, said Canada\u2019s single-payer national health-care system also confers \u201cdistinct\u201d advantages, allowing people to seek care for covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, without fear of out-of-pocket costs.Analysts also point to differences in political leadership.Canadian officials have largely set aside partisan grievances for a \u201cTeam Canada\u201d effort. Alberta Premier Jason Kenney sent excess personal protective gear to provinces in need, including Quebec, led by frequent sparring partner Premier Fran\u00e7ois Legault.That contrasts with the response in the United States, where President Trump has at times seemed to condition federal aid on support for him, and governors have fought with each other and the federal government over critical supplies.ADADThough Canada\u2019s response has not been entirely devoid of politics, Canadian officials have consistently deferred to public health experts and scientists to drive policy decisions and have offered a generally consistent message.Asylum seekers risk their lives to help Canada fight covid-19. Trudeau could upgrade their status.\u201cThere\u2019s been a consensus .\u2009.\u2009. that covid-19 is a very serious health problem and many members of Parliament from all parties have been elevating the messages of health experts over the course of the crisis,\u201d said Eric Merkley, a political scientist at the University of Toronto. \u201cThat distinguishes us from the United States, where the Republican Party has elevated covid skeptics quite substantially.\u201dMerkley is the lead author of a paper that describes Canada\u2019s response as a \u201crare moment of cross-partisan consensus\u201d among political elites and the public.ADCanada\u2019s performance has included missteps. Before the country recorded its first case, officials assured the public that the health-care system was ready and the risk posed by the virus was \u201clow.\u201dADThey would repeat that message into early March. But as cases began to tick up in February, some infectious-disease experts worried that inertia had slowed the government\u2019s response. Some said Canada was too slow to close its borders, screen travelers and enforce quarantines. Some provinces dispatched their own public health workers to airports to screen travelers, encroaching on an area of federal jurisdiction.How the coronavirus spread through a Canadian nursing homeThere were worries about shortages of personal protective equipment. Government efforts to procure supplies ran into barriers. The problem has not been entirely rectified. Chagla said his hospital still faces shortages of N95 respirator masks.ADLong-term-care homes quickly emerged as hot spots. Roughly one-fifth of Canada\u2019s cases and more than 80\u00a0percent of its deaths have occurred in those facilities, according to government figures, despite repeated warnings about their vulnerabilities.Spiraling outbreaks in Ontario and Quebec were so severe that Ottawa agreed to send the Canadian military to help. Soldiers documented abuses including cockroach infestations, force feeding and \u201csignificant gross fecal contamination\u201d in patients\u2019 rooms.Canada had nearly two decades to prepare for a pandemic.ADIn 2003, the severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, killed 44 people in Toronto \u2014 the most deaths outside Asia.ADA commission that reviewed the province\u2019s response to the outbreak said the public health-care system was \u201cbroken, neglected, inadequate and dysfunctional.\u201d In the next outbreak, it advised against waiting for scientific certainty before implementing measures to reduce risk.Kobinger, who helped pioneer the Ebola vaccine, said the advice has not been followed, particularly with respect to guidance on masks. Canada recommended wearing masks many weeks after the United States, reversing an earlier position and confusing citizens, he said.Quebec, Canada\u2019s hardest-hit province, is also the most aggressive about reopeningGardam, who worked on the front lines of the 2003 outbreak, said he agreed at the outset of the coronavirus pandemic with the officials who said Canada had learned lessons from SARS \u2014 \u201conly to find that some of the issues we had during SARS just sort of came up again.\u201dADChagla said now is not the time to be complacent. As of Tuesday evening, Canada had reported more than 110,000 cases of coronavirus, 20th in the world, and 8,843 deaths, according to data kept by Johns Hopkins. A Canadian Senate committee reported this month that the country is ill-prepared to handle a second wave.\u201cI think the Canadian mentality sometimes is to compare yourself to the Americans,\u201d Chagla said. \u201cI think we certainly can, but we can also look and see how could we have improved ourselves.\u201d\n\nMigrant farmworkers die in Canada, and Mexico wants answersCanadian nurses who work in the United States are being made to pick a sideThe world\u2019s indigenous peoples, with tragic history of disease, implore outsiders to keep coronavirus away", "comment": "1.4k Comments", "topic": "The Americas"}, {"cover": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/G5RSHM3CEIZUZORGHGTJ5SHNZE.jpghttps://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/G5RSHM3CEIZUZORGHGTJ5SHNZE.jpg", "title": "Thamee got national acclaim for its Burmese food.

Subscribe today.arrow-rightQ: On Jan.\u200927 of this year, you tweeted a video to remember the victims of the Holocaust and included the voices of several other ambassadors to the U.N. Why did you do that?A: The issue of anti-Semitism is very important to me \u2014 it is a global issue. We should not be silent about it. That\u2019s why I dedicated a lot of effort to educate my colleagues at the U.N. about the danger of hate [and] anti-Semitism.Q: In this fight against anti-Semitism, how important is it to also fight the glorification of the Nazis or Nazi symbols?ADA: I think we have to fight anti-Semitism on all fronts. Today with social media it is a challenge, and we have debates with scholars and legal experts about what we can do regarding, hate crimes, how to deal with freedom of speech and where we draw the line. We cherish freedom of speech, but we cannot cherish freedom of hate.ADQ: Were you directly confronted with anti-Semitism during your time at the U.N.?A: I had difficult moments, both when you hear the voices coming from Iran or the hate crime in Pittsburgh here in the U.S.Q: You mentioned in interviews trips to Dubai and to other Arab countries. How is Israel\u2019s relationship with the Arab states at the moment?ADA: It\u2019s a very important and strategic relationship, beneficial for both sides. We share the common threat over the Iranian regime, which is threatening the entire region.We collaborate and can collaborate more. The issue is whether the Arab states actually recognize, publicly, the accomplishments and cooperation. I think it is about time to move to the next level and to see what we can do publicly, not only behind closed doors.Q: The United Arab Emirates\u2019 ambassador to the United States has spoken publicly about his country\u2019s relationship with Israel and said it\u2019s either \u201cannexation or normalization,\u201d stressing that your country\u2019s annexation plans would make it impossible to go ahead with a normalization process.ADADA: We welcome his involvement and input. It\u2019s important we do take it into consideration and to have a dialogue \u2014 weather it is with Arab or European countries, the U.S. or Russia, China \u2014 it is very important for us, and it is part of the process. But at the end of the day, the Israeli government will have to reach a decision about the issue of applying sovereignty.Q: Are you communicating with any Arab ambassadors over the annexation topic at the moment?A: We always have open channels of communication. We do agree most of the time on most issues. But even if there are issues we don\u2019t agree on, we still discuss them.Q: The Palestinians announced they have ended security cooperation with Israel.ADA: It is not the first time we hear an announcement similar to that one.And this security cooperation is not only beneficial to Israel but for the Palestinians themselves. In a few occasions, we shared information with them that helped prevent terrorist attacks not against Israeli but actually against the Palestinian Authority.ADQ: Is there any attempt at the moment to bring the Palestinians back to the table, to discuss and negotiate?A: We are open-minded. I have been approaching President [Mahmoud] Abbas when he came to the U.N. the last time. .\u2009.\u2009. We are willing to go back to the negotiating table. But it\u2019s difficult to find a good partner on the other side.ADQ: How do you see at the moment the threat coming from Hamas?A: I think Hamas is continuing to occupy Gaza. Instead of supporting the population, they are investing in tunnels and weapons, and that\u2019s unfortunate because it means that they\u2019re actually investing in the future conflict with Israel instead of investing in the future of the Palestinians.Q: Where do things stand with Iran? Do Western countries see eye to eye with Israel when it comes to the question of how to deal with Iran?ADA: We believe the Iranians are not only posing a threat to Israel but to the entire community of the world. In October we have the issue of the arm embargo, whether it will be extended or not. We encourage all countries to support the position of the U.S. and not allow Iran to continue and increase the involvement in supplying arms to different groups in the Middle East.ADQ: Has the Trump administration handled the threat you see coming from Iran in a way that was sufficient?A: We are grateful for the decision to pull out of the Iran deal, it was very important.And we appreciate the strong stance of President Trump and [Secretary of State Mike] Pompeo on this issue. We have stated many times, we will not allow Iran to achieve nuclear weapons, no matter what. We welcome the leadership of the U.S. on this issue.ADQ: There was an explosion in the nuclear facility in Iran. How important was this facility for Iran?A: We will not get into a specific incident. But overall, our policy is very clear about not allowing Iran to achieving the nuclear weapon.Q: What are your plans? What will you be doing next?A: I am concluding five years. It\u2019s a very long term. .\u2009.\u2009. I intend to stay involved in public service. I gained a lot of experience, knowledge and connections that I intend to use in order to support Israel.\n\n", "comment": "10 Comments", "topic": "National Security"}, {"cover": "", "title": "The Fight Over a Coronavirus Vaccine Will Get\u00a0Ugly", "date": "Jul 8, 2020", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/the-fight-over-a-coronavirus-vaccine-will-getugly/2020/07/08/1175e050-c0e1-11ea-8908-68a2b9eae9e0_story.html", "keyword": "China and the world order", "website": "the Washington Post", "author": "", "content": "For most people, a vaccine against the coronavirus can\u2019t come soon enough, as it will be the only tolerable way to achieve herd immunity.

Subscribe today.arrow-rightAnd yet, there\u2019s still a danger that humanity will fail in its quest to control Covid-19. The culprit wouldn\u2019t necessarily be the medical complexity, fiendish as it is, of engineering a vaccine. It could also be the ensuing politics surrounding inoculation. The fights will be intense, irrational and sometimes nasty.The first problem is that even after we become confident that a particular vaccine is effective and safe, there won\u2019t be enough for everyone. So we\u2019ll have to decide: Who should get the shots first? Who won\u2019t get any? These questions will come up between countries, and within them.ADADGiven the right leadership, the world would overcome these difficulties with dignity and wisdom. Forty years ago, for example, as the world shivered in a Cold War between the U.S. and the Soviet Union, humanity nonetheless managed to unite and eradicate smallpox.Today, however, the odds for health-care multilateralism are bad. A new Cold War is underway between the U.S. and China. And a \u201cMy Country First\u201d nationalism is infecting ever more countries, including several of those working on vaccines. \u00a0Rich nations will try to outbid poor ones in securing supplies of the vaccine. And someone like U.S. President Donald Trump may not necessarily \u201cshare\u201d a scarce vaccine invented and made in America with other countries. German officials were outraged earlier this year after reports \u2014\u00a0never confirmed \u2014\u00a0that Trump tried to buy CureVac, a German company working on a vaccine, in order to get exclusive access.ADADEthical problems of triage will also haunt domestic politics. Most people will agree that health-care workers on the front lines should get first dibs on jabs. But, after that, nothing is clear. Should pregnant women get priority? What about the elderly? They\u2019re in greatest danger of dying if infected, but they respond much less to vaccination than younger people do. So if herd immunity is the goal, inoculating the old may not make sense.On it goes, with increasingly charged decisions. What about \u201cessential workers,\u201d and who are they anyway? Migrant workers and prisoners live in cramped conditions. Should they jump the queue? Not least, in this time of Black Lives Matter, there\u2019s the question of whether ethnicity should in some cases confer priority. In the U.S., Black and Latino people are suffering disproportionately from Covid-19. Should\u00a0they get shots before Whites?If these dilemmas are political\u00a0dynamite, they may end up looking trivial next to what\u2019s sure to be the biggest showdown: the standoff between scientific rationality and conspiracy theories. Early in the pandemic, there were hopes that the balderdash of anti-vaxxers would become untenable and their movement would atrophy. Instead, it\u2019s booming.ADADHumans have always spun conspiracy theories, especially at times of calamity. The anxiety that comes with loss of control primes people to seek simple explanations with compelling story lines and an obvious culprit. Unsurprisingly, the Covid-19 epidemic has been accompanied all along by\u00a0an \u201cinfodemic.\u201dFor example, a\u00a0fake-news video called \u201cPlandemic,\u201d claiming that the new coronavirus was hype and that a vaccine would kill millions, was viewed more than 7 million times on YouTube before it was taken down. Demonstrators from Germany to the U.S.\u00a0have been spreading bizarre fantasies that Bill Gates, one of the world\u2019s great\u00a0philanthropists, conspired with \u201cBig Pharma\u201d to engineer SARS-CoV-2 so he could establish a global health dictatorship. He\u2019ll police this with microchips implanted under your skin. There\u2019s no end to this bilge available on the internet.None of this is funny. Conspiracy theories have already led to anti-vaxxers refusing to get shots against measles, thus compromising the already-achieved\u00a0herd immunity and causing new outbreaks of this deadly disease. The same could happen when a coronavirus vaccine\u00a0becomes available.\u00a0The threshold for herd immunity against Covid-19 is estimated at between 55% and 82% of a given population. But only about 50% of Americans\u00a0say they\u2019d\u00a0get vaccinated.ADADSo the time for corona statecraft\u00a0and education is now, before the vaccine arrives. Internationally, countries are likely to be most open to multilateral solutions\u00a0before it\u2019s clear which nation will first develop a vaccine. Domestically, the debate about who has priority has the best chance of staying scientific\u00a0before people are clamoring for jabs. Above all, educating people to distinguish facts from fake news is effective only before they become exposed to, and infected by, conspiracy theories. We have to win the struggle against disinformation this year, or lose the fight against Covid-19 in 2021.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Andreas Kluth is a columnist for Bloomberg Opinion.

But the durability of this much-needed recovery \u2014 and, with that, the sustainable recovery of the global economy \u2014\u00a0is unlikely to be firmly established without a few more iterations\u00a0in the historically tricky process of learning how best to live with Covid-19.Support our journalism. Subscribe today.arrow-rightThe surprisingly strong jobs report for June followed what many others and I felt had been the biggest data surprise ever witnessed by economists and Wall Street analysts \u2014 the previous month\u2019s report.The 4.8 million net new jobs in June were almost twice the 2.5 million in May. It\u2019s a record-setting outcome that came well ahead of the median consensus estimate of 3.1 million, itself subject to a wide variation of individual forecasts, falling essentially in a range of 900,000 to 5 million.ADADThe nearly 2 percentage point drop in the unemployment rate to 11.1 percent was noticeably better than the expected 12.5 percent. And with the Bureau of Labor Statistics indicating that the possible extent of misclassifications had been reduced to 1 percentage point, it pointed to an impressive 7 percentage point drop from the implied April high of some 10 percent.Signs of a strong labor market recovery went well beyond these widely cited headline numbers. Both labor force participation and the employment-to-population rates showed healthy increases, rising to 61.5% and 54.6% respectively. Moreover, every segment of the population experienced a decline in unemployment, including the one that missed out May\u2019s improvement, Black workers.Two other important data releases last week also pointed to a strong bounce in economic activity.ADADThe ISM index of factory activity for June rose by a stunning 9 percentage points to 52.6, beating the consensus estimate of 49.8, powered in part by the critical orders component. This jump in a widely followed supply-side indicator was accompanied by an equally notably rise in an important demand-side indicator: the surge to 98.1 in the consumer confidence index, up from last month\u2019s revised 85.9 and beating an expected 91.5.Such data warrant optimism about the resilience and agility of the U.S. economy in the face of the economic devastation wrought by the Covid-19 shock, let alone the pain and suffering associated with its debilitating and often-too-deadly health effects. They also come as a relief to more open economies around the world, including China and Europe, whose own data pointed to domestic economic improvement.But extrapolating all this good news forward is subject to five sobering qualifications.ADADFirst, the economy is still early in recovering back to pre-Covid-19\u00a0conditions. As impressive as the record two-month tally of more than 7 million new jobs is, it constitutes only a third of what is needed to fully reverse the March-April carnage in employment. The employment-population ratio remains well below its February level.Second, some other data flashed more yellow than green signals last week. This included continuing jobless claims, which rose to 19.3 million, above the expected\u00a019 million, as new claims amounted to a still worrisome 1.43 million. Other high-frequency indicators of economic activity also painted a concerning picture, include the national decline in retail traffic and the increasing number of states experiencing lower mobility.Third, indications are surfacing daily that layoffs are migrating up from small- and medium-sized firms to larger ones as a growing number of these companies talk about \u201cright sizing\u201d for the economy ahead. Airlines led the way last week, with announcements of additional layoffs by American and Air France-KLM, along with new bankruptcies for some Latin American carriers, but this sector is not an exception but rather a leading indicator.ADADFourth, the scale and scope of corporate bankruptcies are expanding beyond the list of usual suspects \u2014 companies that entered the Covid-19 shock with vulnerable balance sheets or whose business evaporated for a long time or both.\u00a0Finally, over the weekend a number of states, including some of the country\u2019s largest such as California and Texas, either halted or reversed more reopenings in response to record new Covid-19 infections and concerns about declining hospitalization capacity. But it was far from a generalized process with a particularly notable exception: Florida\u2019s state authorities resisted the re-closing process despite daily infections topping 11,000, beating the daily record of just more than 10,000 from the previous Tuesday.Together, this supports the view that, rather than constitute a smooth linear process, economic recovery is likely to be bumpy as companies, households and governments look to strike what is an inevitably uncertain and fluid balance between economic activity and public health.ADADOver the next three months or so, the U.S. economy is unfortunately likely to experience a notable moderation in what has been an impressive rebound before once again being in a position to pick up significant steam overall. And this may not be the end of this stop-go-slow-go cycle. But assuming Congress acts to maintain relief measures in a more-targeted and pro-work fashion, as well as initiate work on longer-term policies to bolster productivity and household economic security, these fluctuations should occur in a narrowing band as health and economic experts work\u00a0in concert to strike a sequentially improving balance overall.\u00a0This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Mohamed A.

But in the meantime, if a 15-year-old kid ran, I\u2019d vote for him,\u201d Frump told me in an interview, adding he doesn\u2019t like that Trump seems too willing to throw taxpayer dollars at problems instead of solving them. \u201cHe\u2019s not presidential stuff, and I thought he was because he thought a little differently, and I thought that\u2019s what we needed in the office.\u201dADADBut Frump \u2014 yes, his last name is just like \u201cTrump\u201d but with an \u201cF\u201d \u2014 doesn\u2019t know if he would go as far as to vote for Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee, who is much more liberal than Frump.\u201cI would be willing to bet that [Biden] would never make anybody mad like Trump does,\u201d Frump said. \u201cHe smiles at everything. He doesn\u2019t seem to think there\u2019s a problem anywhere, and he\u2019ll still be smiling when he\u2019s fighting it. That\u2019s a little too politics.\u201d\u00a0Warning signs: Sure, California will undoubtedly vote for the Democratic nominee no matter who Frump picks, but the retiree\u2019s concerns about the president\u2019s leadership and temperament are reflected in a series of national polls over the last several months revealing a major problem for President Trump\u2019s reelection campaign: He\u2019s losing the support of seniors, the country\u2019s most dedicated and reliable voters.\u00a0ADADTrump secured seniors by eight points in 2016 \u2014 and is now trailing Biden by five points on average in recent national polls, according to my colleagues Scott Clement and Emily Guskin.\u00a0Trump is also losing ground with white voters, including those without college degrees who were key to his 2016 victories in several states. \u201cAccording to new New York Times/Siena College polls, Trump is at least slightly behind Biden in six states that he won in 2016 and are pivotal to his reelection path \u2014 including Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, where he trails by double digits,\u201d my colleagues Ashley Parker, Robert Costa and Josh Dawsey reported this weekend.\u00a0Not so sunny: In Florida, where more than 20 percent of voters in 2016 were over the age of 65, Trump won the senior vote by a 17-point margin. A Quinnipiac poll in late April found 52 percent of Florida seniors supporting Biden to 42 percent for Trump, while a Fox News poll around the same time found Biden narrowly ahead. Democratic strategists say if Biden can win over roughly 10 percent of seniors who picked Trump in 2016, he could steal the state.\u00a0The Trump campaign has repeatedly brushed off suggestions it\u2019s struggling with seniors, even as Republicans across the country express alarm.\u00a0Trump recently tweeted a video showing a pro-Trump golf cart parade at The Villages, a heavily Republican Florida retirement community. Anti-Trump protesters lined the street, and the two sides screamed at one another in a stark visualization of the country's deep political divide. In the opening seconds, one man shouts at a woman wearing a \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d shirt and other protesters retort, \u2018White power! White power!\u201d Trump later deleted the video after prompting from advisers and Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.).The video is a reminder of how racism has long been central to Trump\u2019s campaign strategy, especially in galvanizing the support of older white conservative voters who are scared by the country\u2019s growing diversity and want to return to an earlier time, as Trump promises with his \u201cMake America Great Again\" slogan.Times they are a-changin: Back in May, I wrote an article about the senior vote in Florida, and I struggled to find wavering Trump voters like Frump who were unsure if they would vote for him again. I spoke with numerous Republicans or conservative-leaning independents who didn\u2019t vote for Trump in 2016 but couldn\u2019t bring themselves to vote for Hillary Clinton. Those voters are now likely to back Biden.Trump hasn\u2019t done much to win over these sorts of voters in recent months given the coronavirus pandemic and mass protests against racial injustice. In interviews with dozens of seniors across the country \u2014 mostly independents and former Republicans, but also some Republicans and Democrats \u2014 this is what worried them the most about the president:\u00a0ADADHis tweets: Every single person I interviewed, regardless of party, said Trump needs to stop tweeting, speak more purposefully and stop being so divisive. Several seniors noted they are around the president\u2019s age, 74, and would never act as he is acting. Many were particularly bothered by how Trump continues to fan the flames of racial tension in the country. A conservative retiree living in rural central Pennsylvania said he left the Republican Party in 2016 because it felt stuck in time when it comes to civil rights and the environment \u2014 and Trump has proven he made the right decision.\u00a0His coronavirus messaging: Most seniors said they were urged by their doctors \u2014 and, more often, their children and grandchildren \u2014 \u00a0not to leave the house during the pandemic unless necessary and to always wear a mask if they do. They listened and are frustrated Trump isn't conveying a similar message. One devout Trump supporter in Florida, who said only God could stop the pandemic, said she doesn\u2019t leave her house without a mask, as that would be like \u201cdriving with your eyes shut.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0His economic boosterism: When asked about reopening the economy during the pandemic, these seniors rarely talked about themselves \u2014 as most say they will continue to stay home until there\u2019s a vaccine. They instead shared their worries about grown children or grandchildren who have lost their jobs, had their pay slashed or are being rushed back to work in unsafe conditions. In Florida, seniors who worked part-time jobs say they\u2019ve struggled to receive unemployment benefits.\u00a0His bashing of mail-in voting: Most of these seniors said they plan to vote-by-mail this fall rather than possibly expose themselves to the virus by standing in line for hours to cast a ballot in person. Trump is firmly opposed to expanding ballot access through the mail, even though seniors \u2014 including those who support him \u2014 would benefit greatly. It\u2019s almost as if he\u2019s giving these voters an excuse to stay home.\u00a0Voting for Trump or against Trump: Several politically independent seniors spoke about this election and their options for this fall strictly in terms of Trump, rarely if ever mentioning Biden. They very much see 2020 as a referendum on the president, more so than an endorsement of Biden or his vision for the nation.\u00a0Peer pressure: One of the seniors I interviewed in May was a retiree living in northeastern Florida who did not want his name published because his golf buddies are Trump supporters, and he didn\u2019t want them to know his political leanings. After the article ran, he emailed me to say one of those buddies read the article and could tell it was him.\u201cHe needled me a bit in good humor,\u201d the email read, \u201cand when I expressed my shock that he would read The Washington Post, he said, \u2018I don't have the same views as most of these guys we play with!\u2019\"Outside the BeltwayABOUT (THE PRIMARIES) LAST NIGHT: Former Colorado Gov.

But in the meantime, if a 15-year-old kid ran, I\u2019d vote for him,\u201d Frump told me in an interview, adding he doesn\u2019t like that Trump seems too willing to throw taxpayer dollars at problems instead of solving them. \u201cHe\u2019s not presidential stuff, and I thought he was because he thought a little differently, and I thought that\u2019s what we needed in the office.\u201dADADBut Frump \u2014 yes, his last name is just like \u201cTrump\u201d but with an \u201cF\u201d \u2014 doesn\u2019t know if he would go as far as to vote for Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee, who is much more liberal than Frump.\u201cI would be willing to bet that [Biden] would never make anybody mad like Trump does,\u201d Frump said. \u201cHe smiles at everything. He doesn\u2019t seem to think there\u2019s a problem anywhere, and he\u2019ll still be smiling when he\u2019s fighting it. That\u2019s a little too politics.\u201d\u00a0Warning signs: Sure, California will undoubtedly vote for the Democratic nominee no matter who Frump picks, but the retiree\u2019s concerns about the president\u2019s leadership and temperament are reflected in a series of national polls over the last several months revealing a major problem for President Trump\u2019s reelection campaign: He\u2019s losing the support of seniors, the country\u2019s most dedicated and reliable voters.\u00a0ADADTrump secured seniors by eight points in 2016 \u2014 and is now trailing Biden by five points on average in recent national polls, according to my colleagues Scott Clement and Emily Guskin.\u00a0Trump is also losing ground with white voters, including those without college degrees who were key to his 2016 victories in several states. \u201cAccording to new New York Times/Siena College polls, Trump is at least slightly behind Biden in six states that he won in 2016 and are pivotal to his reelection path \u2014 including Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, where he trails by double digits,\u201d my colleagues Ashley Parker, Robert Costa and Josh Dawsey reported this weekend.\u00a0Not so sunny: In Florida, where more than 20 percent of voters in 2016 were over the age of 65, Trump won the senior vote by a 17-point margin. A Quinnipiac poll in late April found 52 percent of Florida seniors supporting Biden to 42 percent for Trump, while a Fox News poll around the same time found Biden narrowly ahead. Democratic strategists say if Biden can win over roughly 10 percent of seniors who picked Trump in 2016, he could steal the state.\u00a0The Trump campaign has repeatedly brushed off suggestions it\u2019s struggling with seniors, even as Republicans across the country express alarm.\u00a0Trump recently tweeted a video showing a pro-Trump golf cart parade at The Villages, a heavily Republican Florida retirement community. Anti-Trump protesters lined the street, and the two sides screamed at one another in a stark visualization of the country's deep political divide. In the opening seconds, one man shouts at a woman wearing a \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d shirt and other protesters retort, \u2018White power! White power!\u201d Trump later deleted the video after prompting from advisers and Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.).The video is a reminder of how racism has long been central to Trump\u2019s campaign strategy, especially in galvanizing the support of older white conservative voters who are scared by the country\u2019s growing diversity and want to return to an earlier time, as Trump promises with his \u201cMake America Great Again\" slogan.Times they are a-changin: Back in May, I wrote an article about the senior vote in Florida, and I struggled to find wavering Trump voters like Frump who were unsure if they would vote for him again. I spoke with numerous Republicans or conservative-leaning independents who didn\u2019t vote for Trump in 2016 but couldn\u2019t bring themselves to vote for Hillary Clinton. Those voters are now likely to back Biden.Trump hasn\u2019t done much to win over these sorts of voters in recent months given the coronavirus pandemic and mass protests against racial injustice. In interviews with dozens of seniors across the country \u2014 mostly independents and former Republicans, but also some Republicans and Democrats \u2014 this is what worried them the most about the president:\u00a0ADADHis tweets: Every single person I interviewed, regardless of party, said Trump needs to stop tweeting, speak more purposefully and stop being so divisive. Several seniors noted they are around the president\u2019s age, 74, and would never act as he is acting. Many were particularly bothered by how Trump continues to fan the flames of racial tension in the country. A conservative retiree living in rural central Pennsylvania said he left the Republican Party in 2016 because it felt stuck in time when it comes to civil rights and the environment \u2014 and Trump has proven he made the right decision.\u00a0His coronavirus messaging: Most seniors said they were urged by their doctors \u2014 and, more often, their children and grandchildren \u2014 \u00a0not to leave the house during the pandemic unless necessary and to always wear a mask if they do. They listened and are frustrated Trump isn't conveying a similar message. One devout Trump supporter in Florida, who said only God could stop the pandemic, said she doesn\u2019t leave her house without a mask, as that would be like \u201cdriving with your eyes shut.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0His economic boosterism: When asked about reopening the economy during the pandemic, these seniors rarely talked about themselves \u2014 as most say they will continue to stay home until there\u2019s a vaccine. They instead shared their worries about grown children or grandchildren who have lost their jobs, had their pay slashed or are being rushed back to work in unsafe conditions.

Mainstream media coverage observed that Trump\u2019s themes seemed \u201cdivisive\u201d and \u201cdark.\u201d Conservative media coverage was more laudatory, using terms like \u201cexcellent\u201d and phrases such as, \u201cOne of the best speeches of his presidency.\u201d Support our journalism. Subscribe today.arrow-rightIt will not surprise readers that the hard-working staff here at Spoiler Alerts was in the former camp. I watched it live and was unimpressed. Trump read the anodyne portions without much enthusiasm but talked with gusto about how a \u201cleft-wing cultural revolution is designed to overthrow the American Revolution.\u201d The Wall Street Journal\u2019s editorial board felt differently, saying \u201cit was only divisive if you haven\u2019t been paying attention to the divisions now being stoked on the political left across American institutions.\u201d ADADNow that I think about it, the Journal may be onto something \u2014 but not in the way it thinks.In his speech, Trump warned: \u201cIn our schools, our newsrooms, even our corporate boardrooms, there is a new far-left fascism that demands absolute allegiance. If you do not speak its language, perform its rituals, recite its mantras, and follow its commandments, then you will be censored, banished, blacklisted, persecuted and punished.\u201d He further asserted, \u201cTo make this possible, they are determined to tear down every statue, symbol and memory of our national heritage.\u201d Most of this is hyperbole. The Mississippi state legislature voting to remove the stars and bars from its state flag is not an example of tearing anything down, it\u2019s democracy in action. The same is true when the Boston Art Commission holds a debate and votes to remove a Lincoln statue.ADADA lot of what Trump is calling \u201ccancel culture\u201d is the effort to establish new norms, the debate over the proper contours of those norms and the ways in which social media is completely unhelpful to this enterprise.In the spirit of civil debate, however, let\u2019s stipulate that to the extent that it\u2019s a thing, cancel culture is a problem. There are concrete examples to point to of woke mobs overreacting to anodyne statements, with bad real-world consequences. On Tuesday, Harper\u2019s published an open letter signed by luminaries ranging from Noam Chomsky to John McWhorter that warned: \u201cThe democratic inclusion we want can be achieved only if we speak out against the intolerant climate that has set in on all sides. The free exchange of information and ideas, the lifeblood of a liberal society, is daily becoming more constricted.\u201dI wrote a book on the modern marketplace of ideas and share some of the concerns voiced in the letter.ADADThe question is how much of a thing it really is, and here we get at the crux of two problems. The first is that, as the Harper\u2019s letter noted, the Trumpist right has developed its own cancel culture, one that is much more brittle. Rolling Stone\u2019s Tim Miller interviewed multiple GOP consultants about why they still supported Trump. One explained, \u201cWoke culture has created no other lane for you but to support him on the one or two things that you like and then you have to countenance all the rest \u2026\u201d That is an absurd position to adopt.The second and bigger problem for Trump is that in the rank-ordering of threats to the Republic, woke mobs are at best a distant fifth behind: 1) a raging pandemic; 2) a possible economic depression; 3) capricious and arbitrary police forces; and 4) an immature president who is incapable of leadership \u2014 heck, incapable of saying the word \u201ctotalitarianism,\u201d much less understand the concept. The first three issues are way more important and way more salient to voters than whether a professor is worried about getting yelled at by students.Jamelle Bouie of the New York Times got at this in his column on Tuesday:ADADIt is one thing to run a backlash campaign, as Trump did four years ago, in a growing economy in which most people aren\u2019t acutely worried about their lives and futures. In that environment, where material needs are mostly met, voters can afford to either look past racial animus or embrace it as a kind of luxury political good. When conditions are on the decline, however, they want actual solutions, and the politics of resentment are, by themselves, a much harder sell.One can extend Bouie\u2019s argument further. Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign had the political advantage of focusing on external threats like economic competition for American workers, illegal immigration and narcotics trafficking. Those three are usually at the top of the queue in any poll asking Americans to rank foreign threats. Trump won the GOP primary in part because he exploited the gap between GOP voters and elites on these issues.In 2020, Trump is no longer stressing foreign threats on the campaign trail even though his administration does. Sure, he occasionally bashes China, but he also talks about his trade deal. He is trying to claim that the biggest threat to America comes from fellow Americans. And even his advisers know that does not sit well with voters.Presidents have agenda-setting power, and Trump talking about cancel culture makes the rest of us talk about it. But even if he wins this issue, he loses. Focusing on it exposes his inability to prioritize the real threats to the country.Trump\u2019s Mount Rushmore speech was not good. But even if it was good, it was, in the end, insignificant.", "comment": "75 Comments", "topic": "PostEverything"}, {"cover": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/TKM5WSV4MYI6VAFZIDWOTJYB3Q.jpghttps://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/TKM5WSV4MYI6VAFZIDWOTJYB3Q.jpg", "title": "As coronavirus cases skyrocket across Texas, hospitals grapple with patient influxes", "date": "Jul 2, 2020", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/as-coronavirus-cases-skyrocket-across-texas-hospitals-grapple-with-patient-influxes/2020/07/02/53a9f5fe-b9a9-11ea-80b9-40ece9a701dc_story.html", "keyword": "China and the world order", "website": "the Washington Post", "author": "Arelis R.

Subscribe today.arrow-right\u201cI didn\u2019t believe it,\u201d Johnston said.Now health-care workers across Texas are seeing those alarming predictions come true, with overwhelmed testing centers, lines at emergency rooms and crowded intensive care units, where it is difficult to maintain adequate numbers of specialized staff.Many hospitals in the state are dealing with a mounting  influx of coronavirus patients and, in some places, shortages of the drug known to be effective in those who are critically ill with covid-19, the disease caused by the virus, plus staffing shortages.ADCase numbers in Texas are three times as high as they were in April, and now the curve that the state flattened with its stay-at-home order is more of an upward arrow. The state saw record-high case counts over the past week, averaging nearly 6,300 a day. More than 175,000 Texans have tested positive for covid-19 and 2,525 have died.AD\u201cThis is actually what the model predicted for a pretty open society,\u201d Johnston said. \u201cIt goes up. It continues to go up,\u201d he said.Gov. Greg Abbott (R), who was among the first governors to reopen businesses on May\u00a01, again closed bars and limited restaurant capacity last week. Abbott prohibited municipalities from implementing mandates on mask wearing and social distancing, but on Friday he required all people in counties with more than 20 coronavirus cases to wear masks while in public.ADWith the virus showing no signs of abating, some hospitals have to look elsewhere for beds for coronavirus patients. Harris Health System, which serves many uninsured patients in Houston and Harris County, has been transferring patients to other hospitals for days. Some are being sent as far as Conroe and Galveston.AD\u201cWe\u2019re pretty full,\u201d said Harris Health spokesman Bryan McLeod. The system had transferred 33 patients in the previous 24\u00a0hours and was planning to relocate 15\u00a0more, he said.Ricardo Cigarroa, an internist and cardiologist at Laredo Medical Center, said Thursday that the hospital has run out of remdesivir, the antiviral medication used to treat seriously ill patients.ADThe drug \u201chelped tremendously,\u201d he said. \u201cFor all of our sick patients who were close to being intubated, and the ones who were already intubated, it was helpful.\u201dCigarroa said the hospital has asked the state for more of the drug. He was told another shipment is coming to Texas, but there are no guarantees that the hospital will receive more.The Department of Health and Human Services said in an email that it will distribute more of the drug in mid-July. Priority goes to the states with the highest proportion of cases.AD\u201cWe await further allocations,\u201d said Roberta Schwartz, executive vice president of Houston Methodist, where there were just 250\u00a0cases in the first surge. Today, the hospital has 520 coronavirus cases and is planning for 800 to 1,000.AD\u201cWe did not expect numbers to go beyond 600,\u201d said Schwartz, who said other hospitals in the Texas Medical Center system are facing similar crunches.Over the past four months, hospitals in Texas tried to control for everything in their power. Public health leaders warned about inadequacies with testing, contact tracing,  public policy and inconsistent messaging. But they could not control what might have prevented this moment: the behavior of individual Texans.The surge of cases \u2014 reflecting the activity of recent weeks, including Memorial Day gatherings \u2014 has awakened concerns about hospital capacity, particularly in intensive care units. Most Texas hospitals \u201care probably at about 75, encroaching on that 80\u00a0percent capacity level,\u201d said Serena Bumpus, director of practice for the Texas Nurses Association and a nurse in Austin. Hospitals can convert space in their buildings for additional covid-19 patient beds. The more urgent problem is whether Texas facilities can staff those new wards, she said \u2014 a problem that could worsen  if more health-care workers fall sick even as cases increase.ADAD\u201cYou\u2019ve got nurses who are bracing themselves \u2014  they are bracing for impact. They are scared,\u201d Bumpus said. \u201cWhen this is all said and done \u2014  will there be more layoffs? Will there be furloughs? Because we\u2019ve already experienced that without the surge.\u201dAlthough some hospitals are overwhelmed and expect the situation to worsen, many doctors across the state are cautiously optimistic because they are able to draw on lessons learned during the first six months of the pandemic. Texas had time to bolster its health-care infrastructure, placing some hospitals and doctors in a confident, if wary, position to fight back, experts said.\u201cThe good news is this is within our control,\u201d said James McDeavitt, dean of clinical affairs at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston who heads Baylor\u2019s Incident Command Center.ADADPat Herlihy recalled transforming one of Baylor St. Luke\u2019s Medical Center\u2019s units in Houston into one that could receive coronavirus patients when he received the advice he needed.Herlihy got a call from a doctor at New York-Presbyterian/Columbia University Medical Center who had seen the worst of the novel coronavirus as it swamped New York\u2019s health-care system with tragic consequences.The first three words out of the New York doctor\u2019s mouth stuck with Herlihy: \u201cPrepare. Prepare. Prepare.\u201dThe reopening of the state worried public health officials who believed it was too fast, prompting medical directors to plan for a possible wave of cases.Texas doctors including Herlihy communicated in real time with colleagues elsewhere, scoured social media, studied YouTube videos from around the world and reviewed articles for anything that could help them get ready. The state and municipalities had time to streamline supply chains for personal protective equipment (PPE) and scale up staff numbers. State officials used their robust emergency management apparatus to deliver ventilators, medicine and test kits.ADADAbbott restricted elective surgeries to help conserve PPE, and he ordered health-care institutions to reserve beds for covid-19 patients. Doctors in New York passed on what they had learned then and now.\u201cIt was very important to communicate in real time because we were learning in real time,\u201d said David Greenwald, director of clinical gastroenterology and endoscopy at Mount Sinai in New York.\u201cWe are hearing from people in Texas,\u201d he said. \u201cAll of that information that we created in March, we memorialized and we have been offering all those resources back out.\u201dHealth-care workers in Texas have been trying to stay abreast of a flood of information on phone calls, Zoom lectures, in published papers and through medical societies.AD\u201cIt\u2019s impossible, impossible,\u201d said Carol Wu, a radiologist at the MD Anderson Cancer Center, describing the tsunami of research coming not only from hard-hit U.S. cities such as New York, but also from China, other Asian countries and Europe.ADIn Texas, many coronavirus patients are significantly younger and a higher proportion are Hispanic, said David Lakey, a former Texas health commissioner. The severity of their illness is not as great as those hospitalized in New York three months earlier, he said.Sam Bagchi, chief clinical officer at Christus Health, which has 30 hospitals in Texas including in Corpus Christi and San Antonio, said watching patients in other places have poor outcomes while on ventilators pushed Christus to try therapies that would keep patients off breathing machines or avoid them for as long as possible. The system cut its coronavirus mortality rate by more than half by May\u00a031. Even the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which provides guidance on public health functions like contact tracing and infection prevention, seemed behind the learning curve, he said.\u201cBecause the CDC has been so challenged, and maybe even politicized, at times we\u2019ve had to look beyond the CDC,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve moved things faster.\u201dADAt St. Luke\u2019s in Houston, Herlihy and his team paid close attention to their staffing needs to determine the right ratio for the volume of patients. They monitored their health-care workers for burnout and fatigue. They set up protocols when patients showed signs of renal failure and cardiac arrest. Each new promising treatment option \u2014 from steroids to remdesivir to convalescent plasma \u2014 were used in intensive care units.Hospitals normally update their protocols after medical journals publish the results of randomized clinical trials and expert groups provide recommendations. But the coronavirus has not allowed a great deal of time for that. Each week, medical chiefs are changing the strategy for how best to take care of their covid-19 patients.Herlihy recently came across international reports of a fungal infection, aspergillosis, found in covid-19 patients and adjusted protocols to get ahead of any fatal consequences.\u201cWhen this thing first happened, there was a lot of fear because it was new,\u201d Herlihy said. \u201cThree months later, we feel more confident. It\u2019s not new, and we know what it does.\u201dSt. Luke\u2019s  is pushing past capacity, shifting beds and making space for more covid-19 patients. The virus is unpredictable, but Herlihy said he is grateful Texas had some time to draw from the experiences of his colleagues to feel secure.\u201cWe have the attitude that failure is not an option,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\n\nLaurie McGinley contributed to this report.", "comment": "751 Comments", "topic": "National"}, {"cover": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/SBKPXJV24UI6VF6BNTYRN77CNQ.jpghttps://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/SBKPXJV24UI6VF6BNTYRN77CNQ.jpg", "title": "Whatever Israel decides, a one-state reality looms", "date": "Jul 1, 2020", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2020/07/01/whatever-israel-decides-one-state-reality-looms/", "keyword": "China and the world order", "website": "the Washington Post", "author": "Ishaan Tharoor", "content": "Want smart analysis of the most important news in your inbox every weekday, along with other global reads, interesting ideas and opinions to know?

Subscribe today.arrow-rightThe Israeli leader is under pressure from settler groups and political parties further to his right to extend Israeli sovereignty over as much as 30 percent of the West Bank as soon as possible, before President Trump\u2019s potential departure from office. Through major policy concessions to Israel over the past three years, as well as its controversial blueprint for Middle East \u201cpeace\u201d unveiled in January, the White House has shown its willingness to move beyond the long-cherished U.S. goal of a \u201ctwo-state solution\u201d in favor of a new status quo more aligned with the interests of the Israeli right.ADAD\u201cApplying Israeli law to much of the West Bank would mean the irreversible end of the Palestinian statehood project, making [Netanyahu] the prime minister who not only buried the two-state solution but annexed choice West Bank real estate,\u201d wrote Aaron David Miller, a former U.S. diplomat and veteran of earlier rounds of Israel-Palestinian peace talks.The rest of the world \u2014 including many lawmakers and pundits in Washington \u2014 still clings to the vision of a viable, independent Palestinian state. Netanyahu\u2019s annexation plans were, of course, rejected by the Palestinian leadership, who suspended cooperation with Israel\u2019s security and civil agencies in protest. But they are also overwhelmingly opposed by the international community: E.U. officials have raised the prospect of sanctions; left-leaning Democrats in the United States now want to suspend or condition military aid to Israel based on its behavior; a host of Arab states engaged in a tacit rapprochement with Israel have warned that annexation would doom their budding friendship.The consensus view among analysts of Israeli politics is that Netanyahu will take a less aggressive approach, perhaps initially extending sovereignty over a small handful of settlement blocs. Announcing \u201csome form of annexation-lite,\u201d explained my colleague Steve Hendrix, would allow Netanyahu \u201cand President Trump \u2014 who both have seen booming economies collapse \u2014 to focus on other fronts.\u201dBut for Palestinians, there\u2019s no moving on. The Palestinian Authority, the entity created to help shepherd the two-state solution forward in concert with the Israelis and the international community, is in deep crisis. It\u2019s at odds with a right-wing Netanyahu government that shows little interest in meeting even baseline Palestinian demands; is facing bankruptcy; is mired in a dysfunctional intra-Palestinian standoff between mainstream factions and the Islamist group Hamas in Gaza; and has become increasingly unpopular among ordinary Palestinians, the majority of whom \u201cnow see the PA as a liability, not an asset,\u201d said Ghaith al-Omari, a former adviser to the Palestinian side in peace talks two decades ago.ADADIf Netanyahu presses ahead with annexation, prominent Palestinian officials fear a definitive end to their already enfeebled statehood project and a future shorn of equal rights of citizenship, where their lives and movements are forever curtailed by the imperatives of the Israeli security state. \u201cIt means that I, as a Palestinian, will not be able to do anything without their permission,\u201d Saeb Erekat, secretary general of the Palestine Liberation Organization, told my colleague Ruth Eglash. \u201cIt means they will control my movements, my planning, my borders and my access to everything. \u2026 They are trying to suffocate me, bury me, and they think I will stand for it?\u201dOthers contend that years of Israeli occupation, land grabs and settlement expansion in the West Bank and around East Jerusalem had already cemented this reality. \u201cContrary to the popular narrative, annexation will not kill the two-state solution \u2014 you cannot kill something that has long been dead,\u201d wrote Yousef Munayyer, a Palestinian American scholar. \u201cRather, annexation is dragging and displaying the two-state solution\u2019s corpse before the world.\u201d\u201cIf you ask Palestinians in the Jordan Valley how they feel about annexation, many will tell you that they thought we had already been annexed long ago,\u201d wrote Salem Barahmeh, executive director of the Palestine Institute for Public Diplomacy, based in the West Bank city of Ramallah. \u201cThis is why we cannot help but ridicule the world\u2019s growing, alarmist, and existential outcry as we approach July 1.\u201dIndeed, the alarm in Washington has been loudest among Israel\u2019s traditional defenders. They argue against annexation on pragmatic, policy terms, recognizing that the current status quo of ironclad Israeli control over Palestinian territory and relative global quiescence over an indefinite military occupation suits both Israeli and U.S. interests \u2014 more so, at least, than a unilateral move that will provoke a backlash from Palestinians and governments elsewhere.ADADBut critics on the Israeli left argue that the case against annexation ought to be one of morality, not tactics. \u201cDuring the era of slavery in the United States, and apartheid in South Africa, there were those who profited from the social order that was enshrined in law at the time,\u201d wrote Yehuda Shaul, one of the founders of Breaking the Silence, an organization of former Israeli soldiers who speak out against the abuses of the occupation.\u201cA fair person isn\u2019t interested in having the society in which he lives imitate their ways,\u201d he added. \u201cAnyone living in a country that was founded as a result of a U.N. resolution, one based on the right to self-determination, would have to betray himself to deny the native people who live alongside us that very same right.\u201dRead more: China\u2019s campaign of \u2018genocide\u2019 could bring the U.S. and E.U. closer togetherThe world\u2019s climate catastrophe worsens amid the pandemicLatin America\u2019s coronavirus crisis is only getting worse", "comment": "0 Comments", "topic": "Today's WorldView"}, {"cover": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/3BR7DXV6HEI6VPNPUEU7SIICN4.jpghttps://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/3BR7DXV6HEI6VPNPUEU7SIICN4.jpg", "title": "In Trump\u2019s new version of American carnage, the threat isn\u2019t immigrants or foreign nations.

If his 2016 campaign to put \u201cAmerica first\u201d was focused on building a wall to keep out immigrants and shedding alliances with nations he believed were exploiting the United States, the president is now aiming his rhetorical blasts at groups of liberal Americans who, he believes, constitute a direct threat to the standing of his conservative base.At Mount Rushmore, under the granite gaze of four U.S. presidents, Trump railed against \u201cangry mobs\u201d pursuing \u201cfar-left fascism\u201d and a \u201cleft-wing cultural revolution\u201d that has manifested in the assault on statues and monuments celebrating Confederate leaders and other U.S. historical figures, including some former presidents, amid the mass racial justice protests of recent weeks.ADAD\u201cTheir goal is not a better America; their goal is the end of America,\u201d the president declared.\u201cWe are now in the process of defeating the radical left \u2014 the Marxists, the anarchists, the agitators, the looters,\u201d Trump told guests Saturday during an Independence Day celebration on the South Lawn of the White House.In making the case that a radical and violent ideology underpins much of the social justice movement that propelled the nationwide demonstrations, Trump has dropped virtually all pretense that he supports millions of peaceful protesters who have called for broad reforms to address what they see as systemic racism and a culture of brutality in police departments.ADTrump made no mention Friday of the victims of police violence, including more than half a dozen black families he met with in the Oval Office last month before he signed an executive order to create national training certification guidelines for law enforcement agencies and establish a database to track police brutality cases.ADInstead, he warned of a \u201cgrowing danger\u201d to the values of the nation\u2019s founders \u2014  a \u201cmerciless campaign to wipe out our history, defame our heroes, erase our values, and indoctrinate our children.\u201dHe boasted of federal authorities apprehending hundreds of looters and vandals, even though the number is lower. He warned of \u201cviolent mayhem\u201d in streets of cities run by \u201cliberal Democrats.\u201d He celebrated the arrest of a \u201cringleader\u201d in the unsuccessful attempt from demonstrators to topple a statue of President Andrew Jackson, Trump\u2019s favorite past president, in Lafayette Square across from the White House. And he asserted that schoolchildren were being taught to \u201chate their own country.\u201dAD\u201cThis was a deeply divisive speech aimed at what Trump sees as real Americans versus anarchists,\u201d presidential historian Douglas Brinkley said. \u201cThat\u2019s not just bigotry to the outside world, but now he\u2019s really attacking millions of Americans as worthless, as socialists, as anarchists.\u201dADTrump\u2019s 2016 campaign was built around the core policy goals of restricting immigration \u2014  in the name of providing more jobs to Americans and reducing crime \u2014 and renegotiating global trade deals in the service of protecting American workers. In his inaugural address in January 2017, the president faulted Washington\u2019s political elite for enriching themselves at the expense of the public at large, ignoring blight and suffering caused by their policies that favored rampant globalization.\u201cThis American carnage stops right here and stops right now,\u201d Trump said.ADTrump exploited the nation\u2019s culture wars after taking office, lambasting African American athletes for kneeling during the national anthem in protest of police brutality and failing to clearly denounce a white supremacist march in Charlottesville that resulted in the death of a counterprotester.ADBut heading into 2020, the president who had promised to \u201cmake America great again\u201d was preparing to run for reelection on a message of economic renewal, touting record stock markets and historically low unemployment rates. He was pointing to the construction of 200 miles of new barrier walls along the U.S.-Mexico border and renegotiated trade deals with Canada, Mexico and China as evidence that he had made good on his 2016 promises.The Trump campaign began rolling out a new motto: \u201cKeep America Great.\u201dADHis mismanagement of the coronavirus pandemic upended those plans. Nearly 130,000 Americans have died of the virus and tens of millions have lost their jobs, and despite a six-week shutdown in wide swaths of the country, infection rates this past week spiked to a record high of more than 50,000 new cases per day.ADTrump\u2019s public approval ratings have tumbled over his response to the pandemic and the racial justice protests. Polls show former vice president Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, opening a sizable lead over Trump nationally and holding an advantage in key swing states.In an effort to halt his slide, Trump has sought to shift blame for scenes of violence and destruction at the protests onto leaders in Democrat-led cities and states, accusing them of losing control of their streets and failing to act with toughness.ADAt Mount Rushmore, Trump appeared to make an oblique reference to Biden after touting the legacies of George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln and Theodore Roosevelt, the presidents carved into the cliffs above him.\u201cNo movement that seeks to dismantle these treasured American legacies can possibly have a love of America at its heart,\u201d Trump said. \u201cNo person who remains quiet at the destruction of this resplendent heritage can possibly lead us to a better future.\u201dADIn a video message Saturday, Biden offered a more hopeful contrast to Trump by casting the racial justice protests of recent weeks as part of the nation\u2019s long-standing struggle \u201cbetween two parts of our character \u2014 the idea that all men and women, all people, are created equal, and the racism that has torn us apart.\u201dAD\u201cAmerican history is no fairy tale,\u201d added Biden, who cited George Floyd, the black man whose death at the hands of Minneapolis police in late May sparked the national outcry.Peter Wehner, who served as a speechwriter for president George W. Bush, said Trump faces an obvious difficulty as he seeks to fan public fears over renewed \u201cAmerican carnage\u201d given that he has been responsible for the stewardship of the country for more than three years.\u201cIt\u2019s an insight into him: He doesn\u2019t view his job in terms of governing. He just views it as a platform to vent and be angry,\u201d Wehner said. \u201cHe\u2019s not just appealing to the base, but he\u2019s appealing to the base of the base. The aperture of the campaign is constricting, not expanding \u2014 he\u2019s energizing a smaller and smaller group of angrier and angrier Americans. And to try to energize that base, he has to say more and more extreme things.\u201d\n\n", "comment": "0 Comments", "topic": "Politics"}]
