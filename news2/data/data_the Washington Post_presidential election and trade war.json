John Lewis but instead spoke of dark forces in the country and suggested that the United States not hold its next presidential election on time. In a country cleaved by political differences, paralyzed by a pernicious virus and suffering from a plunging economy, Thursday presented painful contrasts. It was a day of soaring tributes to the first Black lawmaker to lie in state in the U.S. Capitol Rotunda, offered from the pulpit of the mother church of the modern civil rights movement. And it was a day of pointed reminders that the nation is struggling, even after 244 years, to define itself, to decide what freedom and equality will mean.ADADNinety-six days before Americans select a path into an unknown and fearsome future, the nation\u2019s last four chief executives presented their visions of a country going through its toughest year in half a century.Barack Obama, George W. Bush and Bill Clinton put on masks and traveled to Atlanta\u2019s Ebenezer Baptist Church to say goodbye to a civil rights leader and Democratic House member who preached change, progress and hope. Donald Trump stayed home, spending the morning watching TV and tweeting, holding fast to his program of conflict, nostalgia and restoration.Not one of the three former presidents mentioned his absent successor, yet each seemed to have him very much in mind:AD\u201cJohn Lewis always looked outward, not inward,\u201d Bush said.Clinton said that Lewis \u201cwas here on a mission that was bigger than personal ambition.\u201dADAnd Obama said of Lewis that \u201che believed in us even when we don\u2019t believe in ourselves.\u201d A few minutes later, to hit that note even harder, Obama said the very same words, one more time.The former presidents deployed classic rhetoric \u2014 quotations from Scripture, powerful silences and sweet allusions to Lewis\u2019s grace and humility \u2014 to describe how he earned a respect,  and therefore a power, for which others shout in vain.Trump turned to a classic, too \u2014 to his own lifelong quest to put himself at center stage.ADIn the morning, after his own administration reported discouraging data showing that the economy had tanked in recent months, contracting by a third on an annualized basis because the country had failed to get a handle on the coronavirus, the president scrambled to change the subject. Sixteen minutes after the grim numbers were released, he tweeted for attention \u2014 all grievance, all provocation, all CAPS.AD\u201c2020 will be the most INACCURATE & FRAUDULENT Election in history,\u201d he proclaimed with his 13,087th tweet since he became president. \u201cDelay the Election until people can properly, securely and safely vote???\u201dA funeral for one of the last of the great leaders of the civil rights movement of the 1960s was no place for campaign speeches, yet Trump and his barely-camouflaged disdain for the protesters who have filled American streets in recent months was a clear subtext for many of the eulogies at Lewis\u2019s memorial service.ADObama, in particular, made the point directly: \u201cBull Connor may be gone. But today we witness with our own eyes police officers kneeling on the necks of Black Americans. George Wallace may be gone, but we can witness our federal government sending agents to use tear gas and batons against peaceful demonstrators.\u201dBefore a socially-distanced congregation of 50 of Lewis\u2019s House colleagues and some of his fellow civil rights pioneers, all masked against the virus, Obama, Clinton and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) called on Americans to honor Lewis\u2019s optimistic courage by \u201cnonviolently insisting on the truth,\u201d as Pelosi put it, and, above all, by voting.The scene in the church where the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. once was pastor was unusually universalist for a country so beset by division. Speakers paid tribute to Democrats and Republicans alike who had fought for civil rights. Obama praised both Bush and his father for signing extensions of the Voting Rights Act and hailed Lewis for sticking to his belief that he and his opponents shared a foundational belief in principles of equality and fairness.ADAD\u201cWe must all keep ourselves open to hearing the call of love,\u201d Bush said.Obama hit the same theme: \u201cIn all of us, there\u2019s a longing to do what\u2019s right.\u201d But sometimes, he added, that longing is \u201ctaught out of us. We start feeling as if, in fact, we can\u2019t afford to extend kindness and decency to people. And so often, that\u2019s encouraged in our culture.\u201dHe did not single out his successor in the White House, nor did he need to: Trump had been asked days earlier whether he would pay his respects to Lewis by visiting his casket in the Capitol Rotunda.\u201cNo, I won\u2019t be going, no,\u201d the president of the United States said, his lips tight.Trump has never been big on funerals. He showed up late and stood in the back at the service for one of the most important people in his life, his early mentor and attorney, Roy Cohn. At his own father\u2019s funeral, Trump spoke mainly of himself, listing his real estate projects and noting that Fred Trump had supported each one.ADADHe skipped the Capitol Rotunda honors for Sen. John McCain, the Republican leader and former prisoner of war in Vietnam, a national hero for whom Trump often expressed contempt.\u201cI gave him the kind of funeral that he wanted,\u201d Trump said after that service. \u201cI didn\u2019t get a thank you. That is okay. We sent him on the way, but I wasn\u2019t a fan of John McCain.\u201dTrump\u2019s speaking style might have seemed out of place at the Lewis funeral. But whether he stayed away because he knew he\u2019d be unwelcome or because he considered Lewis an enemy, Trump\u2019s absence was in character: He has always claimed to relish being on the other side, excluded by the establishment. Oppositional by nature, he was elected to be the great disrupter, and as president, he has often been at odds with his own government.ADBut although he was not in Atlanta, his deep, almost physical need to be the focus of attention, to lure the camera back to him, meant he was not about to sit quietly at the White House.ADTrump\u2019s suggestion that the November election be postponed because of the virus crisis seemed less than full-throated. He ended his tweet with question marks, a move he reserves for moments when he has perhaps gone too far, when his lunge for attention might backfire, or when, as in this case, his proposal might be illegal, on its face unconstitutional.Trump\u2019s gambit didn\u2019t win the usual plaudits. His dependable allies in Congress were not jumping off this particular cliff with their president. They could read the room, too.AD\u201cNever in the history of the country, through wars, depressions, and the Civil War have we ever not had a federally scheduled election on time,\u201d said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), \u201cand we\u2019ll find a way to do that again this November 3.\u201dTrump continued apace, tapping out tweets embracing a Long Island pizzeria owner who ticked off some of his customers by flying a Trump 2020 flag, and vowing to \u201cclear out .\u2009.\u2009. the Anarchists & Agitators in Portland.\u201dAs Obama spoke in Atlanta and on every major news channel, the president counterprogrammed by holding an unscheduled meeting in the Oval Office with the family of a soldier who was killed on an Army base in Texas. Spec. Vanessa Guillen\u2019s mother and sisters said Guillen was killed by a fellow soldier who had sexually harassed her. Trump called their story \u201cterrible\u201d and said he would \u201chelp\u201d with their funeral expenses.ADIn midafternoon, Trump paid tribute to Herman Cain, the former pizza chain executive and Republican presidential candidate whose death of covid-19 was announced Thursday. Cain had tested positive for the coronavirus days after attending \u2014 unmasked \u2014 a Trump campaign rally last month in Tulsa.But Trump remained silent about Lewis, and by day\u2019s end, he was back to tweeting about the election: \u201cWe are going to WIN the 2020 election, BIG!\u201dJohn Lewis \u201cplayed the long game,\u201d a member of his congressional staff said at the funeral. He expected people to live up to their ideals. He saw in this spring\u2019s protests a new chance to bend the arc of history.In a final note he left behind to be published on the day of his funeral, Lewis called on \u201cordinary people with extraordinary vision\u201d to \u201credeem the soul of America by getting in what I call good trouble, necessary trouble.\u201d He called the vote \u201cthe most powerful nonviolent change agent you have in a democratic society,\u201d and he admonished Americans to \u201cstudy and learn the lessons of history. .\u2009.\u2009. The truth does not change.\u201dADLate in the day, Trump appeared at a hastily scheduled coronavirus briefing, where he rejected any move to shut down businesses to curb the virus.Asked how, in light of covid-19 cases spreading among Major League Baseball players, he could assure parents that it is safe for their children to return to school, the president had only this to say: \u201cCan you assure anyone of anything?\u201dTrump slammed his predecessors\u2019 \u201ccrazy, horrible, disgraceful \u201d trade deals, complained that the November election would be \u201crigged\u201d and made kind comments about Cain.He did not mention Lewis.\n\n", "comment": "1.8k Comments", "topic": "Politics"}, {"cover": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/LY3HXWAMENCDHAUYXMB2LBZ72Q.jpghttps://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/LY3HXWAMENCDHAUYXMB2LBZ72Q.jpg", "title": "Anthony Fauci built a 40-year truce.

Duda, backed by Poland\u2019s ruling right-wing nationalist Law and Justice party, or PiS, claimed 51 percent of the vote. His challenger, centrist Warsaw Mayor Rafal Trzaskowski, received 49 percent. A few months ago, not many expected the race to be so close.

Jaroslaw Kaczynski, PiS\u2019s influential chairman, mused openly that the Warsaw mayor lacked a \u201cPolish soul.\u201d His allies embraced an aggressively anti-LGBT line \u2014 invoking the threat of a \u201crainbow plague\u201d \u2014 to mobilize older, pious Catholic voters to Duda\u2019s cause.International election monitors decried the deepening political divisions and unfair media environment in which the vote took place. \u201cThe political polarization as well as the lack of impartiality in the public media coverage detracted from a well-run election,\u201d said Thomas Boserup, an official for the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, in a statement. \u201cFollowing a campaign that was lacking in dialogue, it is especially important to emphasize that democracies are based on respect for diversity and the rights of all, not just the majority.\u201d Many experts aren\u2019t convinced that Duda and PiS are interested in extending a hand across the aisle. \u201cGiven how narrow Duda\u2019s victory was, the party is very likely to accelerate its attempts to take over the judiciary, destroy any remaining independent media and subjugate local governments that don\u2019t toe the party line,\u201d wrote Maciej Kisilowski, an associate professor of law and strategy at Central European University in Vienna. \u201cThese election results are a death blow to Poland\u2019s liberal democracy. To those fighting populism around the world, they should also be a cautionary tale.\u201d ADADPoland\u2019s election played out along a familiar template: Wealthy, urban, younger and better-educated voters opted for the liberal candidate, while Duda drew much of his support from the rural Polish hinterland. \u201cJust as in neighboring Hungary and in most of western Europe, the youthful cities are liberal,\u201d noted an editorial in the Guardian. \u201cBut to navigate a route back to power, Poland\u2019s opposition must find a way to win back the trust of communities that have come to associate greater economic security with the cultural conservatism and bigotry of PiS.\u201d To keep its grip on power, PiS may have to keep grinding the ax of division. \u201cPoland is an ethnically homogeneous country, monolingual and overwhelmingly Catholic,\u201d wrote Anne Applebaum in the Atlantic. \u201cNevertheless, Law and Justice propagandists have, over the past decade, successfully manufactured, cultivated, and promoted a tribal division that is every bit as powerful as those that are based on skin color or language.\u201d Not unlike Hungary under illiberal Prime Minister Viktor Orban, the powers that be in Poland may set about reshaping the political system so that the splintered opposition can\u2019t regain power. \u201cThe question is whether they can fulfill all of these plans with 49 percent of voters and the majority of people under age 50 dead set against them,\u201d Applebaum added. \u201cThis was an angry campaign, and some of the people who lost will remain angry. The government will have to keep the culture war going in order to drown them out.\u201d One check on Poland\u2019s democratic backsliding could be the censure of other Western powers. The European Union has already tried to rein in PiS\u2019s capture of Poland\u2019s judiciary, to limited effect. Duda and his allies, meanwhile, cast themselves as defenders of Polish sovereignty against E.U. overreach. \u201cIt will be very difficult for the PiS government and Duda to close the divisions within society that they themselves forced apart for electoral purposes,\u201d wrote Pawel Zerka and Piotr Buras of the European Council on Foreign Relations. \u201cIt will also be hard to convince the rest of Europe that the rights of minorities can be respected in Poland, or that Warsaw is a trustworthy partner.\u201d ADADJust days before the first round of the election, Duda appeared in Washington alongside President Trump, a fellow illiberal nationalist. But U.S. observers doubt the Polish government can count on even the Trump administration \u2014 never mind if Joe Biden wins the November election \u2014 to mitigate whatever E.U. blowback comes its way.\u201cTurning Poland in a hard-right political direction would weaken the country\u2019s standing in Europe and the United States alike,\u201d wrote Daniel Fried, who served as U.S. ambassador to Poland during the Clinton administration. \u201cWhile there are some hard-right elements in Poland who seek to ally themselves with the most strident nationalists around Trump, the United States is never going to be an alternative to the EU for Poland; Poland\u2019s trade ties are with Europe, especially Germany, and the EU remains a source of development funds that Poland still needs.\u201d Read more: Trump\u2019s two main foreign foes plan a major pactThe trouble with making Hagia Sophia a mosque againThe pandemic and the dawn of an \u2018Asian Century\u2019", "comment": "0 Comments", "topic": "Today's WorldView"}, {"cover": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/YAYIU7VQYMI6VGFVE6NGI6NB4Q.jpghttps://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/YAYIU7VQYMI6VGFVE6NGI6NB4Q.jpg", "title": "Biden is the wrong choice to lead the West through Cold  2.0", "date": "Jul 12, 2020", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/07/12/biden-is-wrong-choice-lead-west-through-cold-war-20/", "keyword": "presidential election and trade war", "website": "the Washington Post", "author": "Hugh Hewitt", "content": "If by some stroke of fortune former vice president Walter Mondale had defeated President Ronald Reagan in the 1984 election, would the Soviet Union still exist today, still hold Eastern Europe in its thrall?

Subscribe today.arrow-rightVeterans of the Reagan administration believe, along with many in the liberated countries now part of NATO, that Reagan was indispensable to victory in Cold War 1.0. We can also recall the savaging Reagan took for his alleged lack of intellect and his blunt approach to the Soviets.The central issue of the current campaign ought to be the nature and ambitions of the Chinese Communist Party \u2014 its reckless disregard for the world in the early stages of the coronavirus outbreak, its repression of Hong Kong, what may be genocidal treatment of the Uighurs and its plans to dominate not just the South China Sea but the international order for decades to come. The election of 2020, like that of 1984, ought to turn on which candidate is best equipped to deal with the country\u2019s most significant adversary. Today, that is the general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party, also the president-for-life of the People\u2019s Republic of China, Xi Jinping.ADADThe left has long liked to attack conservatives for a supposed lack of intelligence and sophistication, along with alleged warmongering and other crimes. One of my favorite novels, John Irving\u2019s \u201cA Prayer for Owen Meany,\u201d is marred by this twitch. It was published in March 1989, an unfortunate mere eight months before the fall of the Berlin Wall. It is full of the then-conventional contempt for Reagan that accompanied the nuclear freeze movement, that condemned Reagan\u2019s deployment of Pershing II and cruise missiles in Europe, his embrace of strategic nuclear defense \u2014 derided as \u201cStar Wars,\u201d first by Sen. Edward M. Kennedy and then everywhere on the left \u2014 and, of course, opposition to Reagan\u2019s support for the contra rebels of Nicaragua, which reached hyper-pitch as Iran-contra scandal unfolded.\u201cThe White House, that whole criminal mob, those arrogant goons who see themselves as justified to operate above the law \u2014 they disgrace democracy by claiming what they do, they do for democracy,\u201d Irving has his narrator rail. \u201cThey should be in jail,\u201d he huffs after labeling Reagan an \u201cold geezer\u201d and slamming him with the innuendo of Hollywood stupidity routinely traded in by anti-Reagan newspaper columnists in those days.Now it is Trump taking the slings and arrows of the left, only with far more velocity and fervor, given the evolution of media. That unrelenting chorus of hatred doesn\u2019t change the central question: Who best to deal with the CCP: Trump or former vice president Joe Biden? Trump has been accused of being both too hard and too soft on Xi, Biden of being simply absent or compromised.ADADThe CCP uses loans and debt collection around the world the way the Soviets supported Cuban troops in Africa in the 1980s. Its military buildup is vast and rapid. The CCP\u2019s relentless campaigns of espionage make the Soviets of John le Carr\u00e9 novels seem quaint. Who is better equipped by disposition and experience to deal with the Dragon the way that Reagan dealt with the Bear?Trump\u2019s record and approach here are broad and familiar, as are the praise and criticism of that record. How about Biden\u2019s? Former secretary of defense Robert Gates famously wrote in 2014 that Biden \u201cbeen wrong on nearly every major foreign policy and national security issue over the past four decades.\u201dGates was a guest recently on my radio show to discuss his new book, \u201cExercise of Power.\u201d I asked him about Biden and specifically that comment. \u201cYeah, I stand by that statement,\u201d Gates replied. \u201cI will say, Hugh, it related mainly to things that had happened in the Cold War,\u201d he added, and expanded on the theme:ADAD\u201cBiden voted against every single arms program, I think, that Ronald Reagan put up on the Hill. He voted for the Iraq war and so on. So I do have those policy differences with him. In the Obama administration, we did have a very deep disagreement on Afghanistan. And that was a big deal.\u201d Gates noted occasional agreement with Biden on matters, including President Barack Obama\u2019s policies on Libya and Egypt, but he added:\u201cI also think that the vice president had some issues with the military. And I wrote in \u2018Duty\u2019 [Gates\u2019s memoir] about how he would warn the president that he was being boxed in, that the military was trying to take away his options and so on. And he\u2019d kind of rail at the generals. And that bothered me some. So you know, there are puts and takes with any presidential candidate. He brings a decency and an integrity and so on to the race, but I did have these issues with him.\u201d ADADThose are the words of an individual trusted by presidents of both parties to be secretary of defense and whose long career of public service enjoys a rare bipartisan esteem.For those focused on the central issue \u2014 the existential threat to the country and indeed the West \u2014 the choice of Trump is obvious. Gates did not say so, but if past is prologue, Biden would be to the CCP as President Jimmy Carter was to the U. S. S. R.: naive and paralyzed.Read more:Robert C.

Trump has eschewed the traditional role of the president as consoler-in-chief upon the death of people who had publicly criticized him. He has shown little graciousness toward some Capitol Hill legends after they passed away, including Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Reps. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) and John Dingell (D-Mich.).It took 14 hours for Trump to tweet condolences after Lewis died on July 17 at the age of 80 from pancreatic cancer. In the interim, he posted dozens of tweets, including attacks on his opponent Joe Biden, his former national security adviser John Bolton and his niece Mary Trump. Then he golfed with Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.).

And to Joy, his wonderful wife who he loved so much, my warmest condolences!!!\u201dADThe president\u2019s messages about Lewis contained no exclamation marks, but the three broadcast networks preempted regularly scheduled programming to air live coverage of the memorials for the Democratic congressman from Georgia. The son of sharecroppers almost died at 25 when state troopers beat him viciously, cracking his skull, as he led 600 protesters in a march across the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Ala. During 17 terms in Congress, he championed voting rights.Pence visited the Capitol to pay tribute to his former House colleague. Former vice president Biden drove down from Delaware, with his wife, Jill, to honor Lewis. The Bidens placed their hands on the casket. Biden\u2019s potential vice-presidential picks Sens. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), and Reps. Karen Bass (D-Calif.) and Val Demings (D-Fla.), also came. Congressional Republicans were well represented, led by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.) and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (Calif.).ADLawmakers from both parties gave a standing ovation after a recording was played of Lewis calling for racial justice during a 2014 commencement speech at Emory University. \u201cSupreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor, members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper and congressional aides quietly streamed past the flag-draped casket, which was moved to the top of the East Front steps Monday evening for the public to pay tribute,\u201d Paul Kane, Felicia Sonmez, Meagan Flynn and Michael Brice-Saddler report. \u201cThe tributes at the Capitol came shortly after Lewis\u2019s body made its last visit to Washington\u2019s civil rights landmarks midday Monday, pausing at the Lincoln Memorial, where he was the youngest speaker at the 1963 March on Washington. The motorcade also stopped at the Martin Luther King Jr. memorial, and the newly minted Black Lives Matter Plaza outside the White House, where he made his last public appearance in early June.\u201dQuote of the day\u201cEven though the world around him gave him every cause for bitterness, he stubbornly treated everyone with respect and love,\u201d McConnell said of Lewis.White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany defended Trump\u2019s response to Lewis\u2019s death, noting that he signed a proclamation lowering the flag to half-staff to recognize his civil rights work. The U.S. Flag Code, however, already specifies that flags should be flown at half-staff \u201con the day of death and the following day for a Member of Congress.\u201dADADLewis is only the second black lawmaker in American history to lay in state in the Capitol. The other was Cummings, a close friend, who died in October. Trump also skipped Cummings\u2019s ceremony and funeral. (In addition to Graham, the president visited the Capitol in December 2018 when former president George H.W. Bush was lying in state.)Lewis and Cummings were both outspoken Trump critics. Lewis refused to attend Trump\u2019s inauguration in 2017 on the rationale that he was an illegitimate president because of Russian interference in the previous year\u2019s election. (There is no evidence that any votes were changed. Lewis had also refused to attend George W. Bush\u2019s inauguration in 2001.)Trump lashed out at the congressman, accusing him of being \u201call talk\u201d with \u201cno action or results,\u201d a tone-deaf critique that dominated multiple news cycles. Lewis and other African Americans in Congress later declined to attend the dedication of a civil rights museum in Mississippi because Trump was scheduled to come, as well.ADADLast August, a few months before Cummings died, Trump appeared to poke fun at the congressman after his Baltimore house was burglarized, tweeting: \u201cReally bad news! \u2026 Too bad!\u201d The president later denied he was being facetious after several Republicans had criticized the message, telling reporters on his way to golf at his club in New Jersey that he was not trying to be a \u201cwise guy.\u201d But it had followed days of Trump relentlessly ripping Cummings, who as chairman of the House Oversight Committee was scrutinizing his conduct and issuing subpoenas to his administration. Trump called the city Cummings represented \u201ca rodent infected mess,\u201d said residents are \u201cliving in hell,\u201d blamed Cummings for the city\u2019s problems and claimed that thousands of African Americans had thanked him for spotlighting the city\u2019s problems.Indeed, some of their friends might have been relieved that Trump stayed away from the memorial events. Bass, the chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, tweeted at Trump shortly after Lewis\u2019s death: \u201cWhile the nation mourns the passing of a national hero, please say nothing. Please don\u2019t comment on the life of Congressman Lewis.\u201dTrump skipped McCain\u2019s funeral at the request of the family of the 2008 GOP presidential nominee. The president had said during the 2016 campaign that the former prisoner of war in Vietnam was not a war hero because he got captured. Trump has continued to attack McCain since his death, especially for his decisive vote against the repeal of the Affordable Care Act.ADADOn the night Trump was impeached by the House in December, he suggested during a rally in Michigan that Dingell was \u201clooking up\u201d at the crowd from hell. The president then laced into Rep. Debbie Dingell (D-Mich.), his widow who now holds his seat. Dingell was the longest-serving member of the House in U.S. history and had died just months earlier. Trump did not attend his funeral.The \u201clooking up\u201d riff came the week before Christmas, and the congresswoman replied on Twitter: \u201cMy husband earned all his accolades after a lifetime of service. I\u2019m preparing for the first holiday season without the man I love. You brought me down in a way you can never imagine and your hurtful words just made my healing much harder.\u201dCoronavirus falloutTwitter penalized Donald Trump Jr. for posting hydroxychloroquine misinformation.\u201cThe platform ordered the president\u2019s son to delete the misleading tweet and said it would \u2018limit some account functionality for 12 hours,\u2019\u201d Katie Shepherd and Taylor Telford report. \u201cOn Monday evening, Facebook scrubbed from its site a viral video showing a group of doctors making misleading and false claims about the coronavirus pandemic after more than 14 million people had watched it. Hours later, President Trump tweeted out multiple clips of the same video to his 84.2 million followers. Trump shared the video \u2014 which claims that face masks and shutdowns are not needed to stop the spread of the virus \u2014 as he shared 14 tweets over a half-hour span defending the use of hydroxychloroquine, an antimalarial drug that the president has repeatedly promoted \u2026 Twitter soon followed Facebook and YouTube in removing the videos, deleting several of the tweets that Trump shared, and even adding a note to its trending topics warning about the potential risks of hydroxychloroquine use.\u201dThe GOP gave Trump money for the new FBI headquarters he wants a block from his hotel.\u201cUnder intense White House pressure, Senate Republicans agreed Monday to allocate $1.75 billion in their coronavirus relief bill toward the construction of a new D.C. headquarters for the FBI,\u201d Jonathan O'Connell, Seung Min Kim and Erica Werner report. \u201cBut top Senate Republicans immediately began distancing themselves from the provision after it was made public, saying they weren\u2019t sure why the White House repeatedly insisted on putting it in the bill. At a news conference Monday, [McConnell] initially denied that the FBI money was in the bill, but then was notified by reporters that the language was in fact included. \u2018You\u2019ll have to ask them why they insisted that be included,\u2019 he told reporters, referring to the White House. \u2026 Asked Monday what a new FBI building had to do with the novel coronavirus, Sen. Richard C. Shelby (R-Ala.), a key negotiator of the stimulus package, paused and said, \u2018Good question.\u2019 \u2026ADAD\u201cBefore Trump was elected, officials at his company raised concerns about a competing hotel possibly being built in place of the Hoover Building should the FBI relocate to the suburbs. \u2026 Concerns over Trump\u2019s financial interests, however, prompted the Justice Department\u2019s Inspector General Michael E. Horowitz to launch an investigation of the decision-making that led to the cancellation of the original plan. That investigation remains ongoing more than a year later, the inspector general\u2019s office said Monday. A spokeswoman declined to comment further.\u201dDemocrats were sharply critical of the White House demand. \u201cThey managed to have enough money for $2 billion for the FBI headquarters that benefits Trump hotel and they say they have no money for food assistance,\u201d said Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.). \u201cWhat the heck is going on?\u201d (I wrote Friday about how Trump\u2019s demand for this money in the coronavirus package is the latest example of how he doesn\u2019t have his eye on the ball as cascading crises buffet the country.)McConnell has said this bill will likely represent the last major legislative response by congressional Republicans to the coronavirus pandemic. \u201cSenate Republicans\u2019 legislation, titled the \u2018Heals Act,\u2019 is expected to kick off negotiations with congressional Democrats, who have already vowed to oppose many of the provisions in the Republican plan,\u201d Jeff Stein, Laura Meckler and Tony Romm report. \u201cHouse Democrats in May approved a $3 trillion coronavirus response package that sharply diverges from McConnell\u2019s bill in key ways, leaving the path toward a final compromise unclear on many key questions. \u2026 The legislation is also notable for what it leaves out, as the GOP opted against including new funding for state and local governments and hazard pay for essential front-line workers \u2026 McConnell\u2019s bill includes a five-year \u2018liability shield\u2019 aimed at preventing businesses, universities, schools and hospitals from being sued over coronavirus-related damages.\u201dADADThe Senate bill fails to extend the suspension of federal student loan payments beyond September, drawing the ire of consumer advocates who are urging Congress to offer more help to the 43 million Americans holding $1.6 trillion in education debt. (Danielle Douglas-Gabriel)But the GOP legislation does offer a 100 percent deduction on business meals through the end of 2020 to help high-end restaurants. Experts note that few businesses are paying for their employees to eat out during the pandemic. (I wrote in March about how Trump started pushing for this after he got a phone call from celebrity chef Wolfgang Puck.)Several GOP senators got other stuff they wanted to secure their support for the bill. \"McConnell and his team worked for days to try to put together a $1 trillion package that could unite Republicans in a way that would strengthen their negotiating power with Democrats, but there were signs Monday that Republicans remain split over how to proceed,\u201d Erica, Jeff and Seung Min report. \u201cNew parts of the legislation included a proposal from Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) aimed at bringing production lines back to the United States from China, legislation by Sen. John Cornyn (R-Tex.) that would increase incentives for advanced chip manufacturing, and a measure written by Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio) that would address intellectual property theft at federal funded research centers and universities.\u201dADADSen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.), who clashed last week with Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) over deficit spending, said last night that \u201cthere is significant resistance to yet another trillion dollars\u201d: \u201cThe answer to these challenges will not simply be shoveling cash out of Washington; the answer to these challenges will be getting people back to work. And as it stands now, I think it\u2019s likely that you\u2019ll see a number of Republicans in opposition to this bill and expressing serious concerns.\u201dPPP was intended to keep employees on the payroll. Workers at some big companies have yet to be rehired.\u201cIf the name of the Paycheck Protection Program didn\u2019t make its purpose clear, its key sponsors spelled it out. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) explained that the program \u2018was designed as an alternative for unemployment and to prevent unemployment,\u2019\u201d Peter Whoriskey reports. \u201cBut a closer look at three large companies that received millions from the $517 billion program shows that some companies have not retained most of their staff on the payrolls. \u2026 And the Omni Hotels & Resorts, owned by Texas billionaire Robert Rowling, were approved for multiple loans from the program \u2014 one for each of 15 hotels \u2014 totaling $30 million to $71 million. But seven remain closed, and at those, most workers are on unpaid furloughs, union officials said. The company also has declined union requests to continue to pay health insurance for furloughed workers, union officials said.\u201dTemp agencies were some of the biggest beneficiaries of PPP. Many have been able to turn the government loans into profits. (ProPublica)A Florida man was charged with fraud after receiving $3.9 million in loans from the Paycheck Protection Program to buy himself, among other things, a Lamborghini sports car, the Justice Department said.

Meanwhile, renters face more job losses and fear eviction,\u201d Heather Long reports. \u201cFor Realtor James Dietsche, there is only one way to describe the real estate market right now: \u2018It\u2019s insane.\u2019 A 1950s style three-bedroom home he listed in late June for $200,000 in a small town outside Harrisburg, Pa., received 26 offers the initial weekend it was for sale. Many buyers were young couples seeking a starter home and retirees looking to downsize. But bids also came from Philadelphia, New York City and the Washington, D.C., area. One person was willing to pay up to $50,000 above asking. Several were offering to buy it without inspections.\u201cWhile Dietsche\u2019s cellphone has been ringing with eager buyers, Tammy Steen\u2019s phone has been buzzing for a different reason. Her landlord keeps calling demanding the $700 rent she does not have. Steen, 52, was a hotel housekeeper at a Hampton Inn in Pensacola, Fla. Her temporary layoff now looks permanent. She has yet to receive unemployment aid despite applying in late March. She has applied to countless fast food, retail and maid jobs but has not been hired. She has started selling hot dogs on the side of the road to beachgoers, praying she does not become homeless.\"Two potential coronavirus vaccines are moving into the last phase of testing with 30,000-person trials.Anthony S.

As the virus and related lockdown orders have disrupted trade routes, closed markets and isolated millions from food and medicine, about 128,000 additional children under 5 will die over the outbreak\u2019s first year, their analysis shows,\u201d per Teo Armus. \u201cModeling food supplies in 118 countries, the experts found that measures to contain the virus \u2014 from social distancing and school closures to lockdowns and closed borders \u2014 have pushed communities already stricken with hunger and other woes over the edge. More than half of all deaths, they said, were in sub-Saharan Africa and in war-torn Yemen. Their study was accompanied by an urgent call to action from the heads of several U.N. agencies, including the World Health Organization and UNICEF, who urged global leaders to contribute at least $2.4 billion immediately to address hunger.\u201d (Read the Lancet article here.)Trump reportedly announced he would throw the first pitch at a Yankees game because he was jealous of Fauci.\u201cAn hour before Dr. Anthony S. Fauci threw the first pitch at the season opener between the New York Yankees and the Washington Nationals, President Trump stood on the briefing room stage at the White House and declared that he, too, had been invited to throw out his own opening pitch. Mr. Trump had not actually been invited on that day by the Yankees, according to one person with knowledge of Mr. Trump\u2019s schedule. His announcement surprised both Yankees officials and the White House staff,\u201d the New York Times reports. \u201cBut Mr. Trump had been so annoyed by Dr. Fauci\u2019s turn in the limelight, an official familiar with his reaction said, that he had directed his aides to call Yankees officials \u2026 After the president\u2019s announcement, White House aides scrambled to let the team know that he was actually booked on Aug. 15, although they have not said what he plans to do. Over the weekend, Mr. Trump officially canceled. \u2026\u201cDr. Fauci\u2019s broadcast appearances are generally controlled by the White House, but the appearance at Nationals Park did not have to go through the usual clearance process at the National Institutes of Health, which takes in his other news media and event requests. \u2026 Off the baseball field, Dr. Fauci\u2019s star turn has not gone over as well in the White House. \u2026 As the prominence of the coronavirus task force faded in recent weeks, Dr. Fauci was left out of a new group of White House officials that meets on the virus, led by Jared Kushner, the president\u2019s son-in-law\u2026\u201dThe Marlins\u2019 coronavirus outbreak won\u2019t derail MLB\u2019s just-opened season \u2014 at least not yet.\u201cFor now, the outbreak among members of the Miami Marlins \u2014 with 11 players and two coaches testing positive by Monday, according to an official familiar with the testing \u2014 has not brought down the entire MLB season, and MLB officials hoped the outbreak would be limited to the Marlins, allowing the season to go forward,\u201d Dave Sheinin reports. \"While MLB officials stressed the outbreak was limited to just one team, other teams, including the Cincinnati Reds and Atlanta Braves, have experienced multiple positive tests or symptomatic players in recent days. And if an outbreak spreads across one team, it increases the likelihood of the virus being transmitted to an opponent or \u2014 in the case of the Yankees, who were about to use the same visiting clubhouse at Philadelphia\u2019s Citizens Bank Park that the Marlins just vacated \u2014 potentially a third team as well.

The Department of Homeland Security is also considering a plan to send an additional 50 U.S. Customs and Border Protection personnel to the city,\u201d Devlin Barrett, Nick Miroff, Marissa J. Lang and David Fahrenthold report. \u201cThat may yet work as a campaign tactic, if it provides Trump a way to sell himself as a law-and-order candidate, the antidote to chaos that developed on his own watch. But as a policing tactic, it has failed to suppress the protests. The escalation has been followed by larger, better-equipped and more-aggressive crowds, and \u2014 as the new reinforcements showed \u2014 it exhausted federal resources before it exhausted the protesters. \u2026\u201cThere is growing concern among federal law enforcement officials that some individuals in the crowds outside the courthouse have gotten more aggressive in recent days, and that the number of federal agents on site may not be sufficient to handle them. Protesters have injured federal agents with large commercial-grade fireworks while others aimed lasers at their eyes, leading to several injuries, DHS officials said. Now officials and demonstrators in other cities that have experienced ongoing protests against police violence fear that federal agents will bring the same tactics to them. \u2026 Some federal law enforcement officials worry that agents in Portland may be losing control of the streets around the federal courthouse and losing the public debate over their handling of the unrest.\"\u201cA protest in Austin turned fatal on Saturday when a driver navigated his vehicle toward the marchers and fired at 28-year-old protester Garrett Foster, who had brought an assault rifle to a march, police said. The driver \u2014 fired upon by a third armed man at the scene \u2014 was not injured, officials said, and police released him while their investigation continued. On Sunday evening, other protesters remembered Foster, who had been a regular at past marches about police brutality. They said his death would inspire others to join the cause, chanting, \u2018He didn\u2019t die, he multiplied!\u2019 But some worry that the incident will lead to more guns at the protests, increasing the chances of violence.\u201dThe mayors of Portland and five other major U.S. cities asked Congress to make it illegal for the federal government to deploy militarized agents to cities that don\u2019t want them. \u201cThis administration\u2019s egregious use of federal force on cities over the objections of local authorities should never happen,\u201d the mayors of Portland, Seattle, Chicago, Kansas City, Albuquerque, New Mexico, and Washington wrote in their open letter.

DeMarco, an Iraq veteran who now serves as a major in the D.C. National Guard, also casts doubt on the claims by acting Park Police Chief Gregory Monahan that violence by protesters spurred Park Police to clear the area at that time with unusually aggressive tactics. DeMarco said that \u2018demonstrators were behaving peacefully\u2019 and that tear gas was deployed in an \u2018excessive use of force.\u2019 \u201cDeMarco backs up law enforcement officials who told The Washington Post they believed the clearing operation would happen after the 7 p.m. curfew that night \u2014 but it was dramatically accelerated after [Barr] and others appeared in the park around 6 p.m. Monahan has said the operation was conducted so that a fence might be erected around the park. DeMarco said the fencing materials did not arrive until 9 p.m. \u2014 hours after Barr told the Park Police to expand the perimeter -- and the fence wasn\u2019t built until later that night. \u2026 DeMarco is scheduled to testify Tuesday before the House Natural Resources Committee, which is investigating the government\u2019s actions \u2026 \u201cAs the federal and local police waded into the protesters, DeMarco said he saw smoke being used and that he was told by a Park Police officer it was \u2018stage smoke,\u2019 not tear gas. But DeMarco said, \u2018I could feel irritation in my eyes and nose, and based on my previous exposure to tear gas in my training at West Point and later in my Army training, I recognized that irritation as effects consistent with CS or \u2018tear gas.\u2019\u2019 He said he found spent tear gas canisters on the street later.\u201dCongress has battled airlines, banks, tobacco and baseball.

Dinner was served from buffet trays, and taken back to tables where dozens of party activists sat next to each other. When it was over, candidates walked around the room, shaking hands.\u201cKansans want to know who their candidate is, and they can\u2019t get it always from the TV commercials,\u201d Rep. Roger Marshall (R-Kan.), a medical doctor and candidate for U.S. Senate who spoke at the event, said of the lax coronavirus precautions. \u201cIt's hard. It's a conflicting message. In my heart, what is the right thing to do?\u201dADADMost of the country is still shut down by quarantine orders, to some extent. Just days ago, President Trump canceled the in-person part of the Republican convention over worries about the spread of the coronavirus. But the president's party nonetheless has taken steps toward traditional campaigning, with door-knocking and bustling campaign offices, as Democrats try to pursue a \u201csocially distanced,\u201d mostly virtual strategy.Over a few days in two states, Kansas and Michigan, the difference in how both parties have approached the pandemic was stark. Joe Biden's presidential campaign, which typically sets standards for the party's unified state campaigns, continued to organize supporters in Zoom meetings, training them for the new world of calling voters rather than meeting them in person and instructing them on how to vote safely and make sure absentee votes were counted.But in Michigan, the Trump campaign had restarted traditional door-to-door campaigning weeks ago, observing a few restrictions while rebooting its original voter contact plans, and keeping in tune with Gov. Gretchen Whitmer's mandatory mask order. In Kansas, where 92 of the state's 105 counties opted out of another Democratic governor's mask order, campaigning in those places looked no different from the way it had before a virus began shutting down normal life and economic activity.ADAD\u201cWhat they're doing is irresponsible, and they're putting peoples' lives and their own lives in jeopardy,\u201d said Vicki Hiatt, the chair of Kansas's Democratic Party. \u201cI get that it's an election year, and we've got to reach out to people. We know, through some research, that person-to-person contact with voters is our best way to get to them. But things are different now.\u201dDemocrats had also been critical of Republicans in Michigan, which has had nearly 90,000 cases of covid-19 and more than 6,000 related deaths. There, the president's party shut down in-person campaigning for weeks before its restart last month. Last Wednesday, at a canvass launch in suburban Macomb County, volunteers had to submit to a temperature check before entering the office; once inside, per the campaign's rules, they had to keep their distance, and wear masks.\u201cI have a mask on, and gloves,\u201d said Lisa McClain, a candidate for Congress who was helping out with the canvass. \u201cIf I'm at a house with a porch, I step off the porch. I keep my distance. I've seen everything from people not answering the door to saying: \u2018Come on in, have some coffee.\u2019 Of course I don't do that, but I don't live in fear. I'm still going out to talk to people.\u201dADADDemocrats have not resumed in-person campaigning, even with precautions, though they say they have adapted to the new conditions. Michigan Republicans say they have made 4 million voter contacts; Michigan Democratic Party Chair Lavora Barnes declined to say how many voters the party had reached, while emphasizing that they started making contacts in 2017. And the Progressive Turnout Project, an independent group that focuses on canvassing, has drawn criticism for returning to knocking on doors, after eight employees across its dozen targeted states tested positive for the coronavirus.Kansas, which has not been competitive in a presidential election for decades, is not one of those states. Its most competitive House races, in the 2nd and 3rd districts, are unfolding across counties that have adopted the mask orders.\u00a0But the GOP's Senate primary is taking place everywhere, with much of the vote likely to come from ruby-red rural counties that have returned to the lifestyle that has vanished in bigger cities and suburbs. On Sunday and Monday, at events across western Kansas's \u201cBig First\u201d congressional district, masks were optional, and Senate candidates Marshall and Kris Kobach frequently shook hands with voters. (I took my own mask off at stretches of these events, though I kept some distance from the people I interviewed, and avoided shaking hands.)ADAD\u201cIt is really tough for me to sort out here,\u201d Marshall said. \u201cIn rural areas, where the incidence is so low, Kansans don't like the mask, and they want to shake my hand. I\u2019ve tried really hard through this process, in Johnson County, or Wichita, the bigger cities \u2014 to wear the mask, to do the elbow bumps. It's tough. I think I've had three tests so far, just to try to protect other people because I know I'm meeting lots of people.\u201dNone of the counties that hosted Republican events on Sunday and Monday had been virus-free. Garden City is the heart of Finney County, where there had been 1,688 covid-19 cases and 10 reported deaths, according to CDC statistics. On Sunday, Kobach campaigned in Seward County, which had seen 1,160 cases and 4 reported deaths. In an interview, Kobach emphasized that those cases had been tied to meatpacking plants.\u201cMany individuals working in the meat plant are living in conditions with six, 10 people in a very small building,\u201d said Kobach, Kansas's former secretary of state. \u201cSo it's not just the plant, it's the place where they're living. If you look at the statistics, and I was just looking at them yesterday, Kansas's cases per capita are half the national average. And in Kansas, the vast majority of cases are in urban areas, not the rural parts of the state.\u201dADADIn interviews, Republican voters didn't question whether the coronavirus was real, or whether it could be deadly. At one event, at the chamber of commerce building in Larned, a dozen voters wore masks throughout.\u201cI believe in wearing masks, and I do wear them inside,\u201d said Jan Murphy, 82. \u201cIf I'm outside, and people are standing apart from each other, then that's different.\u201dKobach and Marshall, who lead in polls ahead of next week's primary, both said they mingle with voters but take precautions. \u201cI try to wash my hands 40, 50 times a day,\u201d Marshall said, noting that he had taken three coronavirus tests and never come up positive. Kobach said he had not taken a test, but had never experienced coronavirus symptoms. As long as incidences of the disease in rural areas were low, he and his campaign team would proceed carefully, but keep working in public, in person.ADAD\u201cIf I lived in New York City, I'd be wearing a mask all the time,\u201d Kobach said. \u201cObviously, things can change, but I anticipate that there'll be door-knocking and things like that. And even door knocking can be done in a socially distanced way. People can wear masks. They can drop off door hangers without making contact.\u201dStill, there were moments when rural, conservative voters' frustration with the pandemic, and the seemingly unending quarantines, burst into the open. At a town hall in Ness City, Kobach got a skeptical coronavirus question from Tatum Lee, 40, an advocate for accurate beef labeling who put the event together. Lee, who said in an interview that she was \u201cskeptical\u201d of mandatory vaccinations and some of the newer vaccines required for children, asked what Kobach thought about the idea of requiring a coronavirus vaccine if one became available.\u201cI am 100% against mandatory vaccines, be it for covid, or the flu, or anything else,\u201d Kobach said. \u201cIt's not only wrong to force people to put something in their body; it's unconstitutional to force people to put something in their body.\u201dADADEarlier, at a barbecue lunch in Bucklin, another voter asked Kobach whether \u201cthe virus will go away after the election.\u201d Laughter rippled through the room.\u201cWell, you know it goes away if you participate in a Black Lives Matter protest,\u201d Kobach joked. \u201cYou don't have to wear a mask! It just goes away! Yeah, something tells me there won't be as much coverage of it after the election.\u201d\u00a0Reading list\u201cOne question still dogs Trump: Why not try harder to solve the coronavirus crisis?\u201d by Ashley Parker and Philip RuckerThe politics that may have fatally compromised the anti-coronavirus fight.\u201cWhy Montana Is a test case for Democrats\u2019 winning the Senate,\u201d by Jonathan MartinADHow even the old frontier is seeing the same vote shifts as Midwest and southern suburbs.\u201cTrump keeps touting New Jersey fraud case to attack mail voting.

In many cases, election officials, seeking to avoid a messy fight, have purged the rolls and made the legal threat go away.\u00a0That may be changing in Pennsylvania. Months after Judicial Watch sued the state and three heavily Democratic counties, they've met resistance, and officials in one of those counties say that there won't be a purge before the election. Bucks County Solicitor Joe Khan said today that the relevant officials were simply too busy preparing for balloting under pandemic conditions, and that Judicial Watch's initial complaint had errors that had delayed action, anyway.\u201cThey\u2019re very much on notice that the facts they are putting in their complaints are flawed,\u201d Khan said. \u201cWe have people working around-the-clock making sure that everyone has a chance to vote.\u201dWhile Bucks County voted only narrowly for Hillary Clinton in 2016, it broke heavily for statewide Democratic candidates in 2018, and the area it's part of \u2014 the Philadelphia suburbs \u2014 has swung away from the GOP in local elections. (\"Purely coincidental,\u201d Khan said jokingly, about the timing of the Judicial Watch complaint.) In his initial response to the conservative group, Khan noted that the county had a process in place for removing non-voters, and that some of the information in the complaint was outdated. But Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton was surprised to hear that the county would not be scouring its rolls before November.\u201cThey're obligated to clean the rolls, irrespective of the lawsuit,\u201d Fitton said. \u201cThey've admitted their problems on the rolls, and they haven't cleaned them up, and they don't plan to do anything? That's disturbing.\u201d\u00a0Ad watchMitch McConnell, \u201cKentucky Jobs.\u201d The Senate majority leader has run several ads about the passage of coronavirus relief packages, and this one adds to the theme by blaming Democrats (who held out for more relief as part of the final deal) for not working faster. \u201cWhen we needed help quickly, Nancy Pelosi held that help hostage,\u201d one business owner says, with the sentiment finished by another Kentuckian: \u201cAnd Amy McGrath backs Nancy Pelosi and her left-wing agenda.\u201d What might be most interesting is who doesn't appear in the ad: Chuck Schumer or Joe Biden.\u00a0David Perdue, \u201cDrugs.\u201d The senator from Georgia, under fire for a digital ad that lengthened the nose of his Jewish opponent, has been running low-key straight-to-camera spots that emphasize the results he wants, while warning that Democrat Jon Ossoff wants \u201csocialism.\u201d Perdue here promises to end \u201csurprise billing\u201d and drive down drug costs, while warning that \u201csocialized medicine\u201d (which would end most billing altogether, and make most drugs free) would never pull that off.Kris Kobach, \u201cConservative Champion.\u201d The Senate primary contender in Kansas fell out of the president's favor, in some ways, after his 2018 defeat in the race for governor. But in mail and in this ad, Kobach reminds voters of his long relationship with the president; this footage from 2018 shows Trump calling Kobach \u201ca man who has been with me from the beginning.\u201d The president has made no endorsement in the race.Roger Marshall, \u201cFlames.\u201d Kobach's closest competitor in the Senate race has closed with an emphasis on the 2018 race, and a simple message: \u201cKris Kobach can't win.\u201d This ad goes further, blaming Kobach for mismanagement throughout the 2018 campaign, and insisting he weakened the party, just as he could weaken it in 2020. \n  \n  \n  You are reading The Trailer, the newsletter that brings the campaign trail to your inbox.  \n   \n   \n    \n   \n   \n  \n \nPoll watchNorth Carolina (NBC/Marist, 882 registered voters)Joe Biden: 51% (+2)\u00a0Donald Trump: 44% (-1)Four years ago, Marist struggled to survey key races accurately, stumbling over education demographics in ways that undercounted Trump voters. The process and standards changed in 2018, and the pollster still finds advantages for Democrats that can be explained by external events. Here, by a 29-point margin, voters say they credit the state for prompting the decision to cancel most of the public events for the Republican National Convention in Charlotte, rather than thanking the president for eventually scrapping it after moving to a new Jacksonville location. That cancellation was a risk for Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper, who was condemned by the president and Republicans; he leads in his own reelection bid by 20 points. While voters trust Trump more than Biden on the economy, they trust Biden on the pandemic by a 16-point margin.Candidate trackerJoe Biden made his fourth economic agenda speech on Tuesday afternoon, earmarking $30 billion of small business spending for black, Latino, and Native American businesses.\u201cNearly 18 million people are out of work. Black unemployment is at 15 percent. Latino employment is at 14.5 percent,\u201d Biden said, citing the pandemic-caused decline for voters whose gains the president had previously touted. \u201cOver 40 percent of black-owned businesses, 440,000 in total, reportedly, had to shut down. And, everything is worsened by the crisis of presidential leadership. A change of \u2018tone\u2019 over a few days does not change the facts of the last four years.\u201dBiden also took questions for the first time in a month, telling reporters that he had not been tested for the coronavirus and that he would announce a running mate \u201cin the first week of August\u201d \u2014 i.e., next week.The day before, Biden made his first public appearance with a crowd since the pandemic began, heading to the Capitol where the late congressman John Lewis was lying in state. President Trump, who had feuded with Lewis when the Georgia congressman refused to attend his inauguration, declined to attend. But in remarks outside the White House on Monday, the president continued saying that he would make broad use of executive powers before the election.\u201cThe DACA decision allowed me to do things that some people thought the president didn\u2019t have the right to do,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI was given that right.\u00a0 Drug prices will be coming down very, very substantially.\u00a0No other president has been allowed to do that.\u00a0 No other president has been able to do that.\u00a0No president has ever done what I\u2019ve done for prescription drug prices \u2014 and, by the way, for many other things, too.\u201d\u00a0Dems in disarrayAfter a relatively short primary, with Joe Biden's rivals dropping out just two months after the Iowa caucuses, Democrats have undergone the longest platform-writing exercise in party history. It started with a Biden-Sanders task force that recommended some changes to the nominee's agenda, continued with a platform draft introduced before negotiations began last week, and moved Biden's agenda to the left on health care, criminal justice reform, trade, and, in a few ways, foreign policy.But the estimated 1,076 delegates won by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) want more. A coalition of left-wing activists, which grew out of a similar group of delegates four years ago, is circulating a pledge: Vote against the platform unless it endorses Medicare-for-all. As of Thursday afternoon, 700 delegates had signed on.\u201cThe failing U.S. healthcare system, and what to do about it, was the most discussed topic during this past\u00a0year's presidential debates,\u201d said Alan Minsky, the executive director of Progressive Democrats of America, in a statement announcing the pledge total. \u201cAt the end of these, the exit polling was unequivocal. Democratic voters overwhelmingly want Medicare for All. That certainly sounds like something that should\u00a0be in the party platform.\u201dThere are not enough Sanders delegates to make this happen. While the senator from Vermont won nearly 200 delegates after suspending his campaign in April, he controls a bit more than a quarter of the 3,976 delegates who'll officially nominate Biden and vote the platform through. Sanders forces face the same proportionate lack of clout on the platform committee, which voted down a Medicare-for-all plank this week: 36 votes for, 125 votes against, and three abstentions. In 2016, every Sanders delegate and a rump of Hillary Clinton delegates could alter the platform; this year, it would take a mass exodus of Biden delegates to pass their amendments.The dispute isn't over whether Sanders won the primary, though; it's about whether Democratic voters who nominated Biden also supported Medicare-for-all. It's a surprisingly tricky question. Exit polling typically found that when Democratic voters were asked whether they'd support a \u201cgovernment plan for all instead of private insurance,\u201d they picked the government plan: 57 percent in Iowa, 58 percent in New Hampshire, 62 percent in Nevada, and 49 percent in South Carolina. (In that state, only 46 percent of voters picked \u201cprivate insurance.\u201d)The delegates go further, arguing that a majority of Americans want Medicare-for-all, and that the pandemic has proved its necessity. That's harder to prove. Their announcement on commitments to the Medicare-for-all pledge cited a three-month-old Harris Poll to argue that a majority of Americans backed the proposal. But that poll asked whether voters would \u201csupport or oppose providing Medicare to every American.\u201d And the Medicare-for-all fight that raged in the primary, often to the exasperation of the candidates, was specifically about Sanders's legislation, which would phase all Americans out of their current plans in four years, into a system where most private insurance was illegal; the language put forth by Sen. Kamala D. Harris would include Pete Buttigieg's \u201cMedicare for All who want it\u201d concept, which the left recoiled at during the primary.As the party's \u201cvirtual\u201d convention plans evolve, it's not clear how delegates could continue to fight on this. At a traditional convention, the platform would be voted through during regular business, in the main hall. Democrats have reduced the public-facing part of the convention to just eight hours split over four nights, time expected to be spent on a carefully shaped introduction of Biden, his running mate, and down-ballot candidates. Party rules allow 25 percent of delegates to file a minority report, but if automatic delegates \u2014 the party officials who get automatic, \u201csuperdelegate\u201d status \u2014 vote on the platform, the rebels won't come close. As Politico's Holly Otterbein first reported, Sanders, who has been careful not stoke anti-Biden sentiment on the left, plans to support the platform.\u201cThe senator appreciates that, amid a deadly pandemic which is creating a national health emergency, his delegates understand that now more than ever we must guarantee health care as a human right,\u201d Sanders spokesman Mike Casca said Monday, pointedly saying nothing about the vote against the platform.Countdown\u2026 seven days until primaries in Arizona, Kansas, Michigan, Missouri and Washington\u2026 nine days until primaries in Tennessee\u2026 11 days until primaries in Hawaii\u2026 14 days until primaries in Connecticut, Minnesota, Vermont and Wisconsin\u2026 20 days until the Democratic National Convention\u2026 30 days until the Republican National Convention\u2026 38 days until some absentee ballots start going out\u2026 98 days until the general election", "comment": "36 Comments", "topic": "Politics"}, {"cover": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/RETHQPGRUYI6VPNGTAG7BLUEU4.jpghttps://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/RETHQPGRUYI6VPNGTAG7BLUEU4.jpg", "title": "Pentagon plan will move troops from Germany to Italy, Belgium and back to U.S.", "date": "Jul 29, 2020", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/us-troop-withdrawal-germany/2020/07/29/f5d23982-d19f-11ea-af07-1d058ca137ae_story.html", "keyword": "presidential election and trade war", "website": "the Washington Post", "author": "Missy RyanKaren DeYoungLoveday Morris", "content": "The Trump administration will move about 12,000 troops in Germany to Italy, Belgium and back to the United States, the Pentagon said Wednesday, under a plan that defense leaders said was designed to strengthen deterrence against Russia but that President Trump has insisted would punish Berlin.Support our journalism.

Esper, unveiling the details of a long-awaited review of the U.S. military presence in Europe, said that about 5,600 of the troops would go to Italy and Belgium.  About 6,400 will be based in the United States and conduct some rotational deployments back to Europe, he said.The reduction, larger than previously expected, will reduce the number of U.S. troops stationed in Germany from 36,000 to 24,000, Esper told reporters at the Pentagon.AD\u201cAs anyone can see, the repositioning of our forces in Europe constitutes a major strategic and positive shift, wholly in line with the [national defense strategy], and consistent with other adjustments the U.S. has made within NATO in previous times,\u201d he said.ADTrump, however, has repeatedly criticized Germany for falling short on contributions to the NATO alliance, characterizing a \u201ctremendous delinquency\u201d as the reason for repositioning U.S. forces.While NATO nations share a target for spending 2 percent of their gross domestic product on defense, many member states do not meet that goal, including  Germany.

It is not clear whether the measure will appear in the final version of the bill.ADRepublican Sen. Mitt Romney (Utah) called the decision \u201ca gift to Russia\u201d that would harm U.S. interests. \u201cIt is a slap in the face at a friend and ally when we should instead be drawing closer in our mutual commitment to deter Russian and Chinese aggression,\u201d he said in a statement.ADSen. Jack Reed (R.I.), the top Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, described it as a \u201cself-inflicted wound\u201d that would do the opposite of what Esper said it would.\u201cThis is the type of move Secretary Mattis was able to stand up to in the past, but this administration seems to be unraveling under the strain of the pandemic,\u201d Reed said, referring to Jim Mattis, who  as Trump\u2019s first Pentagon chief  sought to block  presidential moves to buck traditional defense alliances.Former vice president Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, has sharply criticized Trump for his treatment of foreign allies and vowed, if elected, to strengthen NATO. His chief foreign policy adviser, Tony Blinken, told Reuters this week that a Biden administration would review the decision.ADADAt the Pentagon, Esper said the changes were one result of a lengthy review of the U.S. troop footprint, part of an attempt to modernize the military after two decades of insurgent wars and help compete against the advanced militaries of Russia and China.The reorganization in Europe would give commanders greater flexibility, bringing a squadron of F-16 fighter jets to Italy and moving two headquarters to Mons, Belgium, he said, while scrapping a plan to move 2,500 Air Force personnel from a base in Britain to Germany.Esper said that at least some of the forces returning to the United States, including 4,500 members of the 2nd Cavalry Regiment, would conduct rotational deployments to Poland, the Baltic states and the Black Sea region.ADIn addition to moving the headquarters of U.S. European Command to Belgium, Esper said the Pentagon may relocate the U.S. Africa Command, like EUCOM now located near the German city of Stuttgart.ADThe announced moves will cost an estimated \u201cseveral billion dollars,\u201d he said. Some troops will depart within weeks.In a statement, NATO Secretary General Jen Stoltenberg said Washington had \u201cconsulted closely\u201d with NATO nations.\u201cAs we face a more unpredictable world, we are stronger and safer when we stand together,\u201d he said.Esper said the  review of the U.S. military presence abroad had begun in the past year. He  had recently indicated that a first draft of the military\u2019s proposal would not be presented to him for review until September. But Trump, he acknowledged Wednesday, \u201caccelerated\u201d the European portion of the plan in the past month and announced he had approved a withdrawal from Germany.ADThat announcement came just weeks after military leaders discouraged Trump, who is eager to redeem his 2016 campaign pledge to downsize the U.S. military presence overseas before the November election, from ordering new withdrawals from Afghanistan and Syria.ADThe administration has threatened to withdraw troops from South Korea and Japan, which both host tens of thousands of U.S. personnel, amid stalled negotiations over U.S. demands for more compensation. The administration is also discussing future troop numbers with Iraq.The U.S. military\u2019s overseas presence is believed to be about 200,000, slightly more than when President Barack Obama left office.ADWednesday\u2019s announcement brought immediate objections from Germany, where officials have argued they have significantly boosted defense spending in recent years. In 2019, German defense spending increased by 10\u00a0percent, to $49.3 billion, the biggest increase among the world\u2019s 15 biggest military spenders, according to one analysis.However, that still amounts to only around 1.3 percent of GDP. Germany said in 2019 that it would reach its 2 percent NATO defense spending target by 2031, missing a 2024 deadline.ADGerman officials initially had been particularly rankled that they were not informed of the plans before they began to leak in the media, according to one U.S. official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations. \u201cWe are now at last talking to German officials about the issue,\u201d he said in the past week.German Defense Minister Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer has been in touch with U.S. colleagues regarding the plans, ministry spokesman Arne Collatz-Johannsen said. \u201cThe numbers have been communicated, but of course there are further details which have to be discussed,\u201d he said.Peter Beyer, the German government\u2019s transatlantic coordinator, said it was still possible the  plans will fall through.\u201cThere are many opponents in Washington, not only within the Democrats, but also with the Republicans and the Pentagon,\u201d he told German news agency DPA on Monday.Beyer  had sharp criticism for Washington's handling of the decision, saying it was \u201cunprecedented\u201d that the government found out about the move from a newspaper report.\n\n\n\n\n\nMorris reported from Berlin.

But some experts say Pyongyang will likely avoid serious talks with Washington before the U.S. presidential elections in November as there is a chance for a U.S. leadership change.ADKim said in his speech Monday his country has tried to become \u201ca nuclear state\u201d with \u201can absolute might\u201d to prevent another war and that it has now built such a deterrent, according to the Korean Central News Agency.AD\u201cNow, we\u2019ve changed to a country which can defend itself reliably and unwaveringly against high-intensity pressures and military threats and blackmailing by imperialistic reactionaries and hostile forces,\u201d Kim said.\u201cThere won\u2019t be any war on this land again and our national security and future will be guaranteed firmly and permanently because of our reliable, effective self-defensive nuclear deterrent,\u201d Kim said.Kim\u2019s speech followed recent remarks by both North Korean and U.S. officials suggesting they were reluctant to engage in a new round of diplomacy on the North\u2019s nuclear program anytime soon.ADU.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had said President Donald Trump would only want to engage with Kim if there were real prospects of progress.

We must not continue it. We must not return to it,\u201d Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Thursday. \u201cToday, China is increasingly authoritarian at home, and more aggressive in its hostility to freedom everywhere else. .\u2009.\u2009. If the free world doesn\u2019t change Communist China, Communist China will change us.\u201dPompeo\u2019s remarks at the Nixon Presidential Library and Museum in Yorba Linda, Calif., came nearly half a century after President Richard M. Nixon pursued an opening of diplomatic relations with Beijing, and were intended to delineate a sharp break in decades of U.S. policy that Trump aides have described as too lenient.The speech followed addresses from other top Trump aides \u2014 national security adviser Robert C. O\u2019Brien, Attorney General William P. Barr and FBI Director Christopher A. Wray \u2014 who delivered their own indictments of China this month in a coordinated effort to emphasize the administration\u2019s determination to confront Beijing on a wide array of issues.ADADYet the timing of the tougher strategy, coming less than four months before the presidential election, has alarmed Trump\u2019s critics. They questioned whether the president\u2019s eagerness to blame China for the pandemic \u2014 and paint Democratic rival Joe Biden as weak on Beijing \u2014 has led the administration to lash out without thinking through the consequences, an approach one Capitol Hill aide privately termed the \u201cburn it all down phase\u201d of its China policy.\u201cI am deeply concerned that the administration\u2019s approach is one that labors under the mistaken belief that just being confrontational is the same thing as being competitive,\u201d Sen. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.) told Stephen Biegun, Pompeo\u2019s top deputy, at a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing on China this week.Menendez agreed that the U.S. policy must get tougher and said he is working on a bill with fellow Democrats, but he added that \u201cbeing tough is the means, not the ends,\u201d and asked what the administration will do if Beijing follows through on threats to retaliate for the closure of the Houston consulate.ADADBiegun responded that U.S. policymakers have \u201cinvested quite a bit over the last three decades\u201d in trying to coax China into becoming a responsible international stakeholder, only to be betrayed.\u201cSometimes, wishful outcomes are hard to let go of, and many have not,\u201d he told lawmakers. \u201cThis administration has been equally criticized for moving too abruptly or too harshly or for precipitating a new Cold War, which is not our intention.\u201dInside the White House, there are signs that the emerging China strategy remains a work in progress. One White House ally said the series of speeches from Trump aides was prompted by concern among his political advisers that the president \u2014 while attacking Biden for being inconsistent on China \u2014 was himself facing criticism for having vacillated in his approach.ADAD\u201cSomebody pointed out, \u2018We look like we\u2019re flip-flopping ourselves,\u2019\u2009\u201d said this person, who is in semi-regular contact with Trump aides and spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss their private conversations. The person added that Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who has more-moderate views on China, declined a request to deliver his own address.And even as Trump has blamed China for failing to contain the virus, which originated in the city of Wuhan, he has continued to refrain from the kind of sweeping rhetoric used by some of his aides to denounce a string of Chinese offenses.During a Rose Garden news conference two weeks ago, Trump announced that he would sign an executive order to punish China for its imposition of a strict new national security law in Hong Kong. But he spent most of the hour-long event bashing Biden and touting his record in a stream-of-consciousness monologue that resembled a campaign speech.ADADAt a news conference this week, Trump suggested he remained willing to collaborate with Beijing if Chinese researchers are the first to develop an effective vaccine for the coronavirus. He was also relatively muted when asked if his administration would consider shutting down other Chinese compounds in the United States.\u201cIt\u2019s always possible,\u201d he replied.Though Trump came to office projecting a tougher edge on China, his pursuit of a bilateral trade deal \u2014 and his related unwillingness to personally criticize President Xi Jinping or forcefully confront Beijing on human rights \u2014 undercuts efforts within the administration to develop a comprehensive strategy.ADLast month, Trump\u2019s former national security adviser John Bolton asserted in a White House memoir that the president attempted to convince Xi that China\u2019s purchase of more U.S. goods would help Trump win reelection, and that the president told Xi in a private discussion that he was justified in building detention camps for \u00adUighur Muslims.ADBut trade talks have broken off amid the pandemic and Trump has not spoken with Xi since March, providing an opening for China hard-liners within the administration.In Grand Rapids, Mich., last week, Barr inveighed against Chinese surveillance and censorship, and faulted Google, Apple, Microsoft and Yahoo for collaborating with the Communist Party and becoming \u201cpawns of Chinese influence.\u201d Pompeo, who has lobbied U.S. allies to follow the administration\u2019s efforts to ban Chinese 5G telecom giant Huawei, has floated potentially banning Chinese-owned technology apps, including the popular TikTok, a social media platform.ADThe State Department issued a statement this month aligning the United States with an international tribunal\u2019s ruling four years ago that China\u2019s encroachment on disputed shipping lanes in the South China Sea was \u201cunlawful.\u201dADIn his remarks at the Nixon Library, attended by a handful of Chinese political dissidents, Pompeo accused Xi of being \u201ca true believer in a bankrupt totalitarian ideology\u201d that \u201cinforms his decades-long desire for global hegemony built on Chinese communism.\u201dMichael Pillsbury, a China analyst at the conservative Hudson Institute, said Trump, despite his long-standing concerns about China\u2019s unfair trade and intellectual property theft, had not fully endorsed an expansive indictment of the Chinese political system.AD\u201cThis is a new area for the president,\u201d said Pillsbury, who lauded the administration\u2019s \u201cdramatic reappraisal\u201d of the bilateral relationship in an op-ed Thursday.But Trump\u2019s critics faulted the administration for failing to promote an alternative U.S. leadership model abroad. During the Senate committee hearing this week, Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) said Trump\u2019s declared \u201cAmerica first\u201d policy had left all nations free to \u201cpursue their own interests\u201d rather than develop a coordinated response to Chinese aggression.ADAnd Sen. Tom Udall (D-N.M.) cited the administration\u2019s use of federal agents to employ tear gas and make arrests amid protests in Portland, Ore., and asked Biegun whether the United States was \u201cfacing more accusations of hypocrisy\u201d in criticizing China over its actions in Hong Kong.Biegun allowed that the United States is going through an \u201cuncomfortable moment,\u201d but he rejected the comparison and said the administration\u2019s effort to maintain order \u201cdoes not indict our democracy.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of this article misidentified the affiliation of Michael Pillsbury.

Just what is it that keeps investors coming back to gold?The SituationSupport our journalism. Subscribe today.arrow-rightGold surged to a record as the pandemic of 2020 unleashed a  torrent of forces that fueled demand for its\u00a0perceived safety from the turmoil. There were fears of more government-ordered lockdowns through the end of the year, along with a slide in the U.S. dollar against the euro and yen. Moves to cushion the economy from the pandemic\u2019s impact led to the vast creation of new money by central banks, sparking the same fears about an eventual resurgance\u00a0of inflation that drove gold to its last record in September 2011. Bullion had also briefly spiked after Donald Trump\u2019s upset victory in the U.S. presidential election in 2016. In between there were years of steady prices. That began to change in 2019, when slowing global economic growth and a trade war between the world\u2019s biggest economies dented the belief that riskier assets would continue climbing. Holdings in bullion-backed exchange-traded funds surged for four months during the pandemic, their longest streak since 2006, as retail investors piled in.\u00a0With interest rates and bond yields at historic lows, the opportunity cost of\u00a0owning gold has evaporated and investors are looking for havens that won\u2019t lose value.ADADThe BackgroundDiscarded as a monetary system when its peg to the dollar ended\u00a0in the 1970s, gold spiked to $850 in 1980 on a bout of inflation. Prices slumped in the following two decades as\u00a0central banks\u00a0around the world shrank their reserves and miners locked in prices for future production. The launch of the first gold ETF in 2003, which made it possible for retail and equity-market investors to directly access the metal via their stockbrokers, set off a wave of gold buying that lifted prices for almost a decade. Then the 2008 financial crisis sent prices steadily up as money was parked in havens on fear that bond-buying by central banks would lead to hyperinflation \u2014\u00a0it didn\u2019t. Even so, some investors never warmed to gold. Legendary business guru Warren Buffett expressed his disdain\u00a0for the metal because it has no inherent yield and isn\u2019t productive like, say, companies or farmland. He wrote in 2012 that investors in gold are motivated by their \u201cbelief that the ranks of the fearful will grow.\u201dThe ArgumentADADMore than perhaps any other investment, bullion acts as an echo chamber for anxieties about the global financial system and the ability of central bankers to keep economic growth going.\u00a0Gold bears say it is a relic of history and that there are better ways of hedging against uncertainty, including\u00a0financial instruments such as derivatives. Bulls say it offers them a simpler way to protect\u00a0against a wider range of risks. Demand for gold is supported by rising incomes in\u00a0China, India and other\u00a0Asian countries, where families\u00a0often buy it for dowries and there are fewer safe stores of wealth. In the West, some fans of gold, known as \u201cgold bugs,\u201d believe it should be restored to its place as the guarantor of government-issued currencies. Even one of Trump\u2019s nominees for the Federal Reserve was historically an advocate of returning to the gold standard. But ultimately, gold\u2019s reputation for withstanding the effects of inflation \u2014 at the cost of sacrificing returns \u2014 comes into its own when interest rates on bonds drop below the rate of general price increases. Compared with the trillions of dollars\u2019 worth of bonds around the world now delivering  negative returns, gold is shining once again.The Reference Shelf\u2022 Peter Bernstein explores the history of the metal in his book,\u00a0 \u201cThe Power of Gold.\u201dADAD\u2022 Comments from former U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S.

He\u2019d vanquished more than a dozen opponents, however messily, upending the party establishment and sending experienced politicians into retirement. That night was a celebration of his victory \u2014 one deliberately tailored to his ego. It was constrained as he wanted it to be constrained and excessive the way he wanted it to be excessive. A forest of American flags were perfectly aligned at the back of the stage under a massive screen that at one point said nothing more than exactly what Trump would have wanted it to: Trump.Support our journalism. Subscribe today.arrow-rightIn that moment, it seemed unlikely that Trump's campaign would end successfully. He trailed Hillary Clinton relatively narrowly, but history suggested that his insurgent campaign would founder as the election approached. Despite his assertively unapologetic primary campaign, it seemed fair to expect that the speech he gave on that evening would attempt to establish a general-election campaign aimed at broadening his base.ADADIt didn\u2019t. The speech Trump gave four years ago Tuesday was, like so many other parts of Trump\u2019s campaign, dark, angry, deceptive and aimed at riling up the people who already supported his candidacy. He offered a slew of projections and promises that, four years later, seem as bizarre and unlikely as they did then. Importantly, he detailed an approach to the job that seemed dissonant at the time but has been an undercurrent ever since.And, of course, he promised that he alone could fix the problems the nation faced. In November, voters will be asked to evaluate how he did.The speech began as one might expect. Trump formally accepted the nomination and then celebrated having received more primary votes than any previous Republican nominee. It was an accomplishment boosted both by high turnout, the relatively small number of prior candidates in the modern era and the expansion of the population of the United States. But it was a metric that could be parlayed into a victory lap, and so it was.ADADThose niceties complete, Trump offered a concise summary of his thesis.\u201cTogether, we will lead our party back to the White House, and we will lead our country back to safety, prosperity and peace,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will be a country of generosity and warmth. But we will also be a country of law and order.\u201dThere had been two events in the preceding several weeks that amplified that latter message. In mid-June, a man claiming loyalty to the Islamic State entered a gay nightclub in Orlando and killed more than 50 people. A few weeks later, a man in Dallas shot and killed five police officers as a Black Lives Matter protest was happening nearby.To Trump, these weren\u2019t isolated acts of violence. They were evidence of a deep-seated danger.AD\u201cOur convention occurs at a moment of crisis for our nation,\u201d Trump continued. \u201cThe attacks on our police, and the terrorism in our cities, threaten our very way of life. Any politician who does not grasp this danger is not fit to lead our country.\u201dADHe offered the country a promise.\u201cI have a message for all of you: The crime and violence that today afflicts our nation will soon \u2014 and I mean very soon \u2014 come to an end,\u201d he said. \u201cBeginning on January 20th, 2017, safety will be restored.\u201dTo many observers in the moment, it was a bit perplexing. Beyond the aforementioned incidents, it didn\u2019t seem as though there was any particularly chaotic situation in the country. But it served Trump\u2019s purposes to suggest that there was and that it demanded an immediate solution, so a speech that might have been expected to be an effort to embrace Democrats was instead largely a warning about what Democrats had wrought.ADThe pattern Trump used in elevating the issue of crime was the pattern he used over and over throughout the rest of his speech. Present and exaggerate a problem, often using cherry-picked statistics. Insist that he \u2014 and only he \u2014 could and would quickly bring it to an end. His infamous \u201cI alone can fix it\u201d comment that came later in the speech referred somewhat narrowly to what he presented as a thorough corruption in Washington. While the line has been regularly offered out of that context, as we did above, the sentiment it encapsulates was pervasive.ADIt\u2019s hard not to consider Trump\u2019s focus on crime and danger outside the context of the current moment. Trump\u2019s reelection campaign has produced ads warning that his presumptive 2020 opponent, former vice president Joe Biden, would preside over similarly dangerous times should he win in November. To make that point, Trump\u2019s campaign repeatedly highlights recent acts of violence \u2014 violence that, of course, has occurred under Trump.Four years ago, he isolated a few data points to suggest a country growing more dangerous. He noted increases in homicides in large cities, including Chicago and Washington, something he attributed to the Obama administration\u2019s \u201crollback of criminal enforcement.\u201d That violent crime had reached 40-year lows under President Barack Obama went unmentioned.ADIn his first two years in office, the only two for which data are complete, the violent crime rate didn\u2019t drop below the low point seen under Obama. It didn\u2019t even match that low.ADTrump also revisited the theme that probably earned him the nomination in the first place.\u201cThe number of new illegal immigrant families who have crossed the border so far this year already exceeds the entire total from 2015,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are being released by the tens of thousands into our communities with no regard for the impact on public safety or resources.\u201dHe then told a story about a young woman who was killed by an undocumented immigrant, something that would become a staple of his speeches as president.ADWhen Trump similarly focused on immigration during his speech announcing his candidacy the prior June, his announcement was viewed as a lark. So his accusations that immigrants from Mexico were criminals and rapists led to a private-sector blowback, with business partners cutting ties with the Trump Organization and its chief executive. That, though, elevated awareness of Trump\u2019s fiercely anti-immigrant campaign rhetoric, rhetoric that matched what conservative media outlets had been telling Republican voters but that Republican elected officials avoided both as a political calculation and, well, because it was largely false.ADTrump\u2019s speech at the convention was one of a few he has given over the past five years that deliberately tried to remain within the boundaries of accuracy, territory in which Trump isn\u2019t always comfortable. (\u201cI will present the facts plainly and honestly,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe cannot afford to be so politically correct anymore.\u201d) Doing so meant making a relatively unremarkable situation on the border seem alarming. The number of apprehensions at the border in 2015 was also near a 40-year low. But the number of families apprehended was higher, so Trump focused on that.After Trump took office, the number of families apprehended at the southern border first declined and then soared, pushing total apprehensions to levels not seen in decades. This was the catalyst for Trump\u2019s national-emergency declaration aimed at building a wall on the border, and thereby upholding a promise he made repeatedly in 2016, including during that speech. The number of family apprehensions soon declined (well before the wall was actually built), but the national emergency remains.ADTrump then turned his attention to the economy.ADUnder Obama, the Great Recession, which began in 2008, ended and the nation slowly began to regain steam. Again, though, Trump cherry-picked numbers, this time highlighting data points aimed at appealing to nonwhite listeners.\u201cNearly 4 in 10 African American children are living in poverty,\u201d Trump said, \u201cwhile 58 percent of African American youth are now not employed. Two million more Latinos are in poverty today than when President Obama took his oath of office less than eight years ago.\u201dThat figure about African American youth is misleading, as The Washington Post has repeatedly documented. It includes anyone who isn\u2019t working at all \u2014 including students or others not actually looking for jobs. In 2019, by comparison, 76 percent of black Americans younger than 20 were unemployed. By pegging the Hispanic poverty level to the day Obama took office, Trump\u2019s rhetoric benefited from the fact that poverty levels lagged the economic crisis, meaning that the number of people in poverty grew after the recession ended.ADADIn 2018, it\u2019s estimated that the rate of poverty among black children had fallen to about 30 percent. Where that figure stands in the current economic climate is unknown.Trump also criticized Obama for the trade deficit in goods (which grew under Trump) and for increasing the national debt to more than $19 trillion. (It\u2019s now more than $26 trillion.)\u201cAnd yet, what do we have to show for it?\u201d Trump asked. \u201cOur roads and bridges are falling apart, our airports are Third World condition, and 43 million Americans are on food stamps.\u201dThat latter figure fell to about 36 million last year. The promised infrastructure improvements, though, failed to materialize.After a brief riff on foreign policy, rattling off a number of Fox News-friendly accusations against Obama and Clinton (including a pointed mention of the 2012 attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya), he pivoted to his proposals.\u201cThe problems we face now \u2014 poverty and violence at home, war and destruction abroad \u2014 will last only as long as we continue relying on the same politicians who created them in the first place,\u201d Trump said. \u201cA change in leadership is required to get a change in outcomes. Tonight, I will share with you my plan of action for America.\u201cThe most important difference between our plan and that of our opponent is that our plan will put America first,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAmericanism, not globalism, will be our credo.\u201dThat included an overhaul of trade policy. Voters who supported Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) would \u201cjoin our movement,\u201d Trump predicted, \u201cbecause we will fix his biggest single issue: trade deals that strip our country of our jobs and strip us of our wealth as a country.\u201dSanders supporters overwhelmingly voted for Clinton. Beyond killing the Trans-Pacific Partnership, Trump\u2019s main trade achievement was replacing the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with the U.S.-Canada-Mexico Agreement \u2014 which is mostly just an update to NAFTA.Some of the most jarring comments from Trump\u2019s speech center on race.\u201cThe irresponsible rhetoric of our president, who has used the pulpit of the presidency to divide us by race and color, has made America a more dangerous environment for everyone than, frankly, I have ever seen and anybody in this room has ever watched or seen,\u201d Trump said.Obama\u2019s administration had \u201cfailed America\u2019s inner cities,\u201d he said, using his preferred shorthand for black Americans.\u201cIt\u2019s failed them on education,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt\u2019s failed them on jobs. It\u2019s failed them on crime. It\u2019s failed them on every single level.\u201d\u201cWhen I am president, I will work to ensure that all of our kids are treated equally, and protected equally,\u201d he insisted. \u201cEvery action I take, I will ask myself: Does this make life better for young Americans in Baltimore, in Chicago, in Detroit, in Ferguson, who have as much of a right to live out their dreams as any other child in America?\u201dThis is presumably part of the \u201cgenerosity and warmth\u201d Trump insisted would be part of his presidency. It can be judged as a promise on its own merits.Trump then switched to the issue of terrorism. He pledged to eradicate the Islamic State, the last territorial vestiges of which were eliminated in early 2019. He also pledged to stamp out \u201cIslamic terrorism\u201d more broadly, insisting that the United States would \u201cwin fast.\u201dTo that end, he reiterated his pledge to \u201csuspend immigration from any nation that has been compromised by terrorism until such time as proven vetting mechanisms have been put in place.\u201d\u201cWe don\u2019t want them in our country,\u201d he added off the cuff.As president, Trump did implement multiple versions of his travel ban, after moderating it to be less specifically about adherents of Islam.His speech then pivoted back to immigration, looping the acceptance of refugees from conflict-ridden areas such as Syria in with immigrants crossing into the United States illegally.\u201cWe are going to be considerate and compassionate to everyone,\u201d he said. \u201cBut my greatest compassion will be for our own struggling citizens.\u201d Another pattern: I will be nice, but, more important, I will be tough.He has been the latter, at least. As president, Trump sharply reduced refugee immigration into the country. He moved to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which offered those who\u2019d come to the United States illegally as children a way to remain here legally.Trump accused Clinton of supporting policies that offered economic advantages to immigrants over U.S.-born workers, bringing him back to the economy.\u201cI have made billions of dollars in business making deals \u2014 now I\u2019m going to make our country rich again,\u201d he said. He promised new trade deals (see above) as well as a battery of other proposals.But governing is trickier than orating. For example, Trump said he would \u201cbring our jobs back to Ohio and Pennsylvania and New York and Michigan and all of America.\u201d Because of the coronavirus pandemic, the number of people working in each of those states is lower than when Trump took office. In fact, it\u2019s lower than when Obama took office.At another point, he promised he would \u201cnever, ever sign bad trade deals.\u201d Trump has expressed frustration about the parameters of the preliminary trade deal he signed with China.On other economic points, Trump hit closer to the mark. He promised massive tax cuts, which he delivered \u2014 although his pledge that \u201cmiddle-income Americans will experience profound relief\u201d doesn\u2019t capture what happened, and his pledge to simplify filing was abandoned.\u201cWe will repeal and replace disastrous Obamacare,\u201d Trump said at another point. \u201cYou will be able to choose your own doctor again.\u201dAn effort to replace the Affordable Care Act, better known as Obamacare, failed in the summer of 2017. Congress did repeal the individual coverage mandate it included as part of the aforementioned tax law, but as recently as Sunday, Trump was still promising that his administration would soon reveal a full replacement to the law.He promised to help relieve student debt, which didn\u2019t happen. He promised to rebuild the military, which he often insists he did. He promised to provide veterans with the ability to choose their own doctor or hospital, something Obama had already done. He promised to get rid of the Johnson Amendment, which limits the ability of religious institutions to weigh in on politics. He says he did this, but he didn\u2019t.After more than an hour and after recognizing his family both present and departed, Trump reached his conclusion.\u201cHistory is watching us now,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s waiting to see if we will rise to the occasion, and if we will show the whole world that America is still free and independent and strong. I\u2019m asking for your support tonight so that I can be your champion in the White House.\u201dHe ended with the now-familiar refrain: \u201cWe will Make America Great Again!\u201dBut his actual conclusion, the moment in which he most fully summarized his feelings in the moment, came a bit before that, as he was winding up to the soaring rhetoric plugged into his teleprompter.\u201cRemember: All of the people telling you that you can\u2019t have the country you want are the same people that wouldn\u2019t stand\u201d \u2014 a brief stumble \u2014 \u201cI mean, they said Trump doesn\u2019t have a chance of being here tonight,\u201d Trump said, ad-libbing. \u201cNot a chance! The same people. Oh, we love defeating those people, don\u2019t we? Love it, love it, love it.\u201dThat was what Trump was there to celebrate. A few minutes later, he was onstage with wife Melania Trump and Mike and Karen Pence, and balloons were falling and people were shouting and clapping and hurrahing at the four of them and their families.It\u2019s hard to imagine that Trump has enjoyed any moment more in the four years since.", "comment": "0 Comments", "topic": "Politics"}, {"cover": "", "title": "Always rocky, China-US relations appear at a turning point", "date": "Jul 24, 2020", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/always-rocky-china-us-relations-appear-at-a-turning-point/2020/07/24/31180aa0-cd84-11ea-99b0-8426e26d203b_story.html", "keyword": "presidential election and trade war", "website": "the Washington Post", "author": "", "content": "BEIJING \u2014 Four decades after the U.S. established diplomatic ties with Communist China, the relationship between the two may have reached a turning point.Tensions have reached new heights on what has always been a rocky road, as the ambitions of a rising superpower increasingly clash with those of the established one.

It was China\u2019s first in the United States.ADSetting aside political differences, the U.S. and China promoted economic, social and cultural ties that were briefly interrupted a decade later by China\u2019s military crackdown on the 1989 pro-democracy demonstrations in Beijing\u2019s Tiananmen Square.ADEconomic links grew exponentially in the following years, with heavy investment by U.S. businesses in China and an accompanying Chinese trade surplus that has reached $350 billion annually.The relationship was punctuated by bouts of tension. The U.S. continues to support Taiwan militarily, and the Clinton administration sent an aircraft carrier through the Taiwan Strait in 1996 after China fired missiles toward the island.In 2001, a Chinese fighter jet and a U.S. Navy surveillance plane collided over the South China Sea, a vital shipping lane in the Asia-Pacific region. China detained the U.S. crew for days after its plane made an emergency landing at a Chinese base.ADADAs China has grown into the world\u2019s second-largest economy, behind only the U.S., it is increasingly viewed as a competitor, both economically and militarily, and a potential challenger to the Western-led democratic model that has dominated the post-World War II era.Election-year politics in the U.S. are fanning the flames, as President Donald Trump appears to be using friction with China to drum up support among his base. Whether or not he is reelected in November, underlying differences will remain.\u201cWe are looking at a structural change in the relationship, which will continue even if Trump does not get a second term,\u201d said Steve Tsang, director of the China Institute at London\u2019s School of Oriental and African Studies.ADMilitarily, American and Chinese warships often jockey for position in the South China Sea. Economically, the U.S. is leaning on its allies to exclude Chinese telecom leader Huawei from their mobile networks, raising the specter of cybersecurity. On human rights, the U.S. is imposing sanctions over Chinese policies in Hong Kong, Tibet and Xinjiang,ADTougher U.S. views on China have now been \u201cbaked into the system,\u201d Tsang said.Pompeo\u2019s speech was the latest in a series of sharp criticisms aimed at China by Cabinet-level U.S. officials, including Defense Secretary Mark Esper and Attorney General Bill Barr.Although Trump earlier played up what he called a warm relationship with Chinese leader Xi Jinping, communication between the sides has fallen to new lows.AD\u201cThe kind of engagement we have been pursuing has not brought the kind of change in China that President Nixon hoped to induce,\u201d Pompeo said. \u201cThe truth is that our policies \u2013 and those of other free nations \u2013 resurrected China\u2019s failing economy, only to see Beijing bite the international hands that fed it.\u201dChu Yin, a professor at the University of International Relations in Beijing, said Americans who advocated engagement are disappointed that China\u2019s economic growth and the emergence of a middle class has enhanced the legitimacy of the ruling Communist Party rather than sparking democratic change.ADTrump\u2019s domestic political strategy has added some explosive elements to the structural problems in the relationship, he said.AD\u201cChina will not take Pompeo\u2019s speech seriously. It is the last cry of a lame duck,\u201d Chu said. \u201cChina wants to have dialogue with a U.S. politician who is more commensurate with the status of a major country.\u201dHe declined to forecast the future, saying: \u201cLet us be more patient at this turbulent time.\u201dCopyright 2020 The Associated Press.

Subscribe today.arrow-rightFour years later, we\u2019re debating whether there\u2019s ever been a more powerful chief justice than John G. Roberts Jr., who has just completed a hugely consequential term in which he played the essential role. He was in the majority of every crucial decision and wrote many of them.\u201cIt is perhaps cliche by now to say the chief justice was the star of the term,\u201d said Washington lawyer Lisa S. Blatt, who appears frequently before the Supreme Court. \u00a0\u201cBut there is no other way to see the term: The chief took the bull by the horns and did what he wanted.\u201dWhat event reversed Roberts\u2019s fortunes? The election of Donald Trump in the fall of 2016. What might make Roberts\u2019s dominance short-lived? The reelection of Donald Trump in 2020.ADADIn fact, if you assumed the next two justices to leave the court would be its oldest, both liberals, the best-case scenario for a long Roberts reign would be the election of presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden. His replacements presumably would maintain the status quo.Being the Supreme Court\u2019s median justice \u2014 they hate being called the \u201cswing\u201d vote \u2014 requires more than smarts and savvy. It involves being in the right place at the right time \u2014 there must be four justices more consistently conservative and four justices more consistently liberal.Justice Sandra Day O\u2019Connor occupied that spot for years. After she left, and was replaced by someone more conservative, it was Justice Anthony M. Kennedy who took over the spotlight. And when Kennedy retired in 2018 and was replaced by someone more conservative, his protege Brett M. Kavanaugh, it was Roberts\u2019s turn in the middle.What was the Roberts court in name became the Roberts court in reality.But remember back to 2016. Justice Antonin Scalia died unexpectedly in February, seemingly giving President Barack Obama the chance to make his third Supreme Court nomination, after Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan. Obama\u2019s choice would have broken the court\u2019s stalemate of four conservative justices chosen by Republican presidents and four liberal ones picked by Democrats.ADADSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) gave conservatives at least a temporary reprieve. He said he would not allow the Senate to vote on a replacement and that the choice should be up to the next president. He made good on that promise, denying Obama\u2019s nominee, federal appeals court judge Merrick Garland, so much as a hearing.Still, few thought at the time the next president would be Trump. Most believed the next justice would be Garland or perhaps an even more liberal choice nominated by Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.A Democratic-appointed justice would have given the left a dominant role on the court for the first time in half a century. When the court split ideologically in such a makeup, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg \u2013 released this week from a hospital after a possible infection \u2013 would be the senior member in the majority, not the chief justice.ADADWe know how that turned out. Partly because he convinced evangelicals and other conservatives they could trust him on Supreme Court picks, Trump won three and half years ago. He chose Colorado federal appeals court judge Neil M. Gorsuch for the Scalia opening. And then Kavanaugh to replace Kennedy.The moves secured the court\u2019s conservative majority, and it put Roberts in the middle. \u00a0Roberts\u2019s alliances with the liberals this term made headlines: Together, they formed the five-justice majorities to stop the Trump administration from dismantling the Obama-era program protecting undocumented immigrants brought to the United States as children, and to cool the expectations of the antiabortion movement by striking down a restrictive Louisiana law.ADBut Roberts was also in the majority in all three cases that religious conservatives won this term. In fact, the court split 5-to-4 in 13 cases this term; Roberts and the other conservative justices made up the majority in nine of them.ADStill, Trump was not happy with his high-profile losses on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program and his claim he was untouchable by congressional investigators and a New York prosecutor. \u201cDo you get the impression that the Supreme Court doesn\u2019t like me?\u201d the president tweeted at one point.Trump emphasized the point last week during an interview with Fox News\u2019s Sean Hannity as a reason he should be reelected.AD\u201cWe need more judges and more justices,\u201d Trump said. \u201cYou see that now with the Supreme Court, more than ever. And the next president \u2014 I\u2019ve had two \u2014 and the next president is going to be able to pick two, or three, or one or whatever.\u201dRoberts is a savvy operator on the court no matter its makeup. Still, he remains in the central position so long as the justices a reelected Trump would replace are conservatives or the ones a President Biden would replace are liberals.ADThere\u2019s something to be said, of course, about reinforcing the status quo if either Trump or Biden are able to replace justices with like-minded successors. Gorsuch and Kavanaugh were roughly 30 years younger than the men they replaced and should have lengthy tenures on the court.ADConservative activists pushed the idea this spring that either Justice Clarence Thomas, 72, or Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr., 70, might be ready to leave, giving Trump the chance to name younger conservatives. McConnell has sworn to fill any opening that might arise.Anything can happen, but the term came and went without such announcements.On Election Day, the two oldest justices will be liberals: 87-year-old Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer, by then 82. Neither seems particularly eager to leave. \u00a0If Biden gets to replace either, he would be maintaining the status quo, albeit with a new generation. Roberts\u2019s place would seem to be secure.ADBut if Trump chooses a replacement for one of the liberals, it would shift the court\u2019s center of gravity considerably, and it would diminish Roberts\u2019s influence. As the most influential of five conservatives, the court moves to the right only as far and as quickly as the chief justice wants. The scenario changes if he were one of six.ADSo add this as another reason the coming presidential election will be so crucial.But keep something else in mind as well. Whether a president gets the chance to replace a Supreme Court justice is one of the least predictable events in American politics. And a justice\u2019s decision to leave usually is more about the justice than who\u2019s in the Oval Office.As Supreme Court wise man Walter E. Dellinger once said: \u00a0\u201cGenerally, it is God who decides whether presidents get Supreme Court appointments.\u201dThe coronavirusThe U.S. set a single-day record with more than 70,000 new coronavirus cases. Hospitals in the Sun Belt are strained.\u00a0\u201cIn California, doctors are \u00adshipping patients as many as 600 miles away because they can\u2019t be cared for locally. In Florida, nurses are pouring in from out of state to reinforce exhausted medical workers. And in Texas, mayors are demanding the right to shut down their cities to avoid overwhelming hospitals,\u201d Griff Witte and Rachel Weiner report. \u201cOfficials on Thursday said they are concerned that hospitals will soon hit a breaking point if the trajectory of ever-growing caseloads doesn\u2019t change. \u2018We can withstand a surge. We can withstand a disaster. But we can\u2019t withstand a disaster every single day,\u2019 said Jason Wilson, associate medical director of the emergency department at Tampa General Hospital \u2026 The peril was reflected in another grim set of data out of Florida on Thursday, with the state reporting a record number of deaths \u2014 156 \u2014 and adding nearly 14,000 new cases, its \u00adsecond-highest total to date. \u2026ADAD\u201cIn California, the worst effects were being felt in the southern part of the state, where hospitals have been inundated. In Imperial County, along the Mexican border, doctors have been so overwhelmed by the demand for care that they have begun sending patients as far away as Sacramento \u2014 a nine-hour drive to the north. \u2026 With medical staff in especially short supply, Defense Department teams began deploying to California hospitals this week to bolster the response. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R), meanwhile, requested that the Federal Emergency Management Agency send 1,500 nurses. Across Texas, mayors of some of the state\u2019s biggest cities \u2014 including Houston and Austin \u2014 are so worried about staffing needs at local hospitals that they have asked for the authority to reimpose stay-at-home orders.\"Nebraska, Utah and Oregon each shattered yesterday their previous single-day records of cases.\u00a0The total number of infections nationwide topped 3.5 million, with at least 135,000 deaths, per our tracker.\u00a0Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp\u2019s (R) administration went to court seeking to block Atlanta from enacting new restrictions and requiring residents to wear masks. A week ago, Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms (D) reverted to Phase 1 guidelines, pushing restaurants to close dining rooms and requiring masks. More than 100,000 Georgians have tested positive. (Atlanta Journal-Constitution)An outbreak shut down Florida\u2019s emergency operations center. An official said 13 people working there tested positive. (Isaac Stanley-Becker)Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) said \u201cthere is no shutdown coming\u201d as the state recorded 10,457 new cases. \"People are panicking, thinking I'm about to shut down Texas again,\" he said. \"The answer is no. That is not the goal. I've been abundantly clear.\" (Texas Tribune)The Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee has shrunk dramatically and has been rebranded under the slogan \u201cConvention Across America.\" While originally expected to draw 50,000 people, planners expect as few as 300 to show up \u2013 including media, security and DNC staff. Last evening, convention planners sent an email telling all members of Congress and delegates to stay away from the convention. All party business meetings will be conducted online. (NYT)Utah parents, in two meetings that featured few masks and little social distancing, protested a mandate by Gov. Gary Herbert (R) that would\u2019ve had their kids in masks and demanded in-person classes this fall. There are more than 30,000 confirmed cases in Utah, and the number is rising. (Salt Lake Tribune)Some teachers are saying they\u2019d rather quit than risk their health by going back to school. \u201cI love, love my job. But this? It\u2019s not worth my life,\u201d a Dallas-based teacher told BuzzFeed News. \u201cI\u2019m scared of getting sick and bringing it to my family. I\u2019m scared of dying. I think we all are, you know?\u201dPrivate schools are reopening even as the public schools in the same towns are not. In Honolulu, for example, public schools will remain closed but not the private Punahou, which has an on-staff epidemiologist. (NYT)Quote of the day\u201cWhen [Trump] says open, he means open in full, kids being able to attend each and every day in their school. The science should not stand in the way of this,\u201d said White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany on reopening schools. The U.S., she said, is an \u201coutlier\u201d among Western nations in terms of getting kids back to school. \"The science is on our side here and we encourage for localities and states to just simply follow the science, open our schools.\"\u00a0Americans\u2019 views of Trump\u2019s handling of the pandemic have deteriorated significantly, a new Post-ABC News poll found.\u201cThe Post-ABC poll shows 38 percent of Americans approve of his handling of the outbreak, down from 46 percent in May and 51 percent in March. Sixty percent disapprove, up from 53 percent in May and 45 percent in March,\u201d Scott Clement and Dan Balz report this morning. \u201cMore than half of the public\u201452 percent\u2014now disapproves \u2018strongly\u2019 of Trump\u2019s handling of the outbreak, roughly double the percentage who say they strongly approve of his efforts \u2026 A 63 percent majority say it is more important to try to control the spread of the virus even if it hurts the economy, up from 57 percent in May. \u2026 On the subject of masks, nearly 8 in 10 Americans say they are wearing one most or all of the time when they come close to others in public.\u201d\u00a0The disappearance of covid-19 data from the CDC\u2019s website spurred an outcry.\u00a0\u201cOn the eve of a new coronavirus reporting system this week, data disappeared from a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website as hospitals began filing information to a private contractor or their states instead. A day later, an outcry \u2014 including from other federal health officials \u2014 prompted the Trump administration to reinstate that dashboard and another daily CDC report on the pandemic,\u201d Lena Sun and Amy Goldstein report. \u201cAnd on Thursday, the nation\u2019s governors joined the chorus of objections over the abruptness of the change to the reporting protocols for hospitals, asking the administration to delay the shift for 30 days. In a statement, the National Governors Association said hospitals need the time to learn a new system, as they continue to deal with this pandemic. The governors also urged the administration to keep the information publicly available.\"A document prepared for the White House coronavirus task force suggests 18 states are in the \u2018red zone.\u2019\u00a0That means \u201cthey had more than 100 new cases per 100,000 population last week. Eleven states are in the \u2018red zone\u2019 for test positivity, meaning more than 10 percent of diagnostic test results came back positive,\u201d the Center for Public Integrity reports. \"The document has been shared within the federal government but does not appear to be posted publicly. Dr. Ashish Jha, director of the Harvard Global Health Institute, said he thought the information and recommendations were mostly good. \u2018The fact that it\u2019s not public makes no sense to me,\u2019 Jha said Thursday. \u2018Why are we hiding this information from the American people? This should be published and updated every day.\u2019\u201dThe White House warned that the next stimulus package \u201cmust\u201d include Trump\u2019s payroll tax cut proposal.\u201cTrump\u2019s renewed push for a payroll tax holiday comes as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) prepares to unveil legislation next week that he hopes will launch negotiations on the next major coronavirus bill. Key Republican senators have been cool to the idea of a payroll tax cut in the past, partly because it only helps workers who are actually employed. Congress has rebuffed Trump\u2019s previous demands for a payroll tax cut for individuals, instead approving a round of checks to individual Americans as part of the $2 trillion Cares Act in March,\u201d Erica Werner and Jeff Stein report. \u201cBut now, as Congress and the administration prepare to write what will probably be the last major coronavirus spending bill before the November election, Trump is again demanding a payroll tax cut. He and some allies view the policy as an effective way to stimulate the economy and quickly give workers a boost.\u201d \u00a0Russian cyberspies are trying to steal vaccine research, security officers in the U.S., Britain and Canada said.\u00a0\u201cThe hackers, who belong to a unit known variously as APT29, \u2018the Dukes\u2019 or \u2018Cozy Bear,\u2019 are targeting vaccine research and development organizations in the three countries, the officials said in a joint statement. The unit is one of the two Russian spy groups that penetrated the Democratic Party's computers in the lead-up to the 2016 presidential election,\u201d Ellen Nakashima, William Booth and Amanda Coletta report. \u201cOfficials did not divulge whether any of the Russian \u00adefforts have been successful, but, they said, the intention is clear. \u2018APT29 has a long history of targeting governmental, diplomatic, think tank, health-care and energy organizations for intelligence gain, so we encourage everyone to take this threat seriously and apply the mitigations issued in the advisory,\u2019 said Anne Neuberger, cybersecurity director for the U.S. National Security Agency. Moscow has denied the allegations.\"\u00a0Seema Verma, a top health official, violated federal contracting rules.\u00a0\u201cVerma, head of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services within the Department of Health and Human Services, brought in high-paid contractors from June 2017 to April 2019 to provide strategic communications advice to boost her personal profile,\u201d Yasmeen Abutaleb reports. \u201cThe inspector general\u2019s finding details how Verma leveraged personal and political relationships to award personal contracts for work that should have been done by government employees, adding that the agency \u2018paid some questionable costs.\u2019\u201d\u00a0ADFacing backlash, USA Today said an op-ed by White House trade adviser Peter Navarro attacking Anthony S.

Leaders in the region are monitoring the increasing caseload with an eye on avoiding spikes seen in other states,\u201d Julie Zauzmer and Dana Hedgpeth report. \u201cD.C. Health Director LaQuandra Nesbitt said three measurements in the city are cause for concern: the rate of transmission, a caseload that is not declining and a high prevalence of cases seemingly unconnected to one another, rather than traceable to one cluster of infections.\u201d \u00a0The D.C. health department will now announce July 31 whether schools will be allowed to reopen in the fall, or if they will need to go entirely virtual. (Perry Stein)The Nationals are exploring alternatives to Nationals Park because of D.C.\u2019s virus regulations. The main reason for the uncertainty is players, coaches and staff have to quarantine for 14 days if they are exposed to the novel coronavirus, per the city\u2019s health protocols. The District is unwilling to bend that requirement for the Nationals, Jesse Dougherty and Dave Sheinin report.The Washington teamFifteen former female Redskins employees said they were sexually harassed during their time at the club.\u201cA few months after Emily Applegate started working for the Washington Redskins in 2014, she settled into a daily routine: She would meet a female co-worker in the bathroom during their lunch breaks, she said, to commiserate and cry about the frequent sexual harassment and verbal abuse they endured,\u201d Will Hobson and Liz Clarke report. \u201cApplegate is one of 15 former female Redskins employees who told The Post they were sexually harassed during their time at the club. The other 14 women spoke on the condition of anonymity, citing a fear of litigation because some signed nondisclosure agreements with the team that threaten legal retribution if they speak negatively about the club. The team declined a request from The Post to release former female employees from these agreements so they could speak on the record without fear of legal reprisal. This story involved interviews with more than 40 current and former employees and a review of text messages and internal company documents.\u00a0\u201cTeam owner Daniel Snyder declined several requests for an interview. Over the past week, as The Post presented detailed allegations and findings to the club, three team employees accused of improper behavior abruptly departed, including Larry Michael, the club\u2019s longtime radio voice, and Alex Santos, the team\u2019s director of pro personnel. In a statement, the team said it had hired D.C. attorney Beth Wilkinson and her firm, Wilkinson Walsh, \u2018to conduct a thorough independent review of this entire matter and help the team set new employee standards for the future.\u2019 \u2026 The allegations raised by Applegate and others \u2014 running from 2006 to 2019 \u2014 span most of Snyder\u2019s tenure as owner and fall into two categories: unwelcome overtures or comments of a sexual nature, and exhortations to wear revealing clothing and flirt with clients to close sales deals. \u2026\u00a0\u201cNone of the women accused Snyder or former longtime team president Bruce Allen of inappropriate behavior with women, but they expressed skepticism that the men were unaware of the behavior they allege. \u2018I would assume Bruce [Allen] knew because he sat 30 feet away from me \u2026 and saw me sobbing at my desk several times every week,\u2019 Applegate said. Allen, who was fired at the end of last year, did not reply to interview requests. While Applegate and others did not accuse Snyder of acting improperly with women, they blamed him for an understaffed human resources department and what they viewed as a sophomoric culture of verbal abuse among top executives that they believed played a role in how those executives treated their employees.\u201d\u00a0Les Carpenter, who covers the team for The Post, drew five takeaways from the report, which comes as the team is in the midst of changing its historically problematic name. \u00a0The Trump presidencyRepublicans fear that the Trump campaign\u2019s shake-up won\u2019t counteract his self-sabotage.\u00a0\u201cNumerous Republicans and Trump allies said Thursday that the personnel overhaul \u2014 demoting Brad Parscale and replacing him with Bill Stepien as campaign manager \u2014 does little to address the main problem facing the struggling Trump campaign: the president himself and his chronically self-destructive behavior,\u201d Ashley Parker, Josh Dawsey and Robert Costa report. \u201cEven stalwarts are bewildered by what many view as his self-sabotaging actions, worried not only that he may lose in November but also that he will drag the rest of the party down with him. \u2026 Charlie Dent, a Republican former member of Congress from Pennsylvania, said Trump is out of step with members of his own party, especially those in tough reelection fights. \u2026 \u2018There\u2019s a total disconnect there between the president and those members in swing districts who need the president to be more measured and balanced \u2014 and, of course, he\u2019s totally incapable of that,\u2019 [he said]. Replacing the campaign manager, Dent continued, is hardly what most Republicans care about. \u2018It\u2019s all these other erratic and bizarre comments and behaviors that are causing the most heartburn for a lot of Republicans, by far\u2019 Dent said.\u201dMary Trump said she\u2019s heard her uncle Donald use the \u201cn-word\u201d and use anti-Semitic slurs.\u00a0The president\u2019s niece \u201cmade the allegation during an interview with MSNBC\u2019s Rachel Maddow,\u201d Colby Itkowitz reports. \u201cMaddow asked whether that was a generalization about her family\u2019s casual bigotry or if she\u2019d actually heard her uncle use racist language. \u2018Oh yeah, of course I did,\u2019 Mary Trump said. \u2018And I don\u2019t think that should surprise anybody given how virulently racist he is today.\u2019 \u2026 White House spokeswoman Sarah Matthews rebutted Mary Trump\u2019s allegation. \u2018This is a book of falsehoods, plain and simple,\u2019 Matthews said ... \u2018The President doesn\u2019t use those words.\u2019 \u2026 \u00a0In the Maddow interview, Mary Trump also slammed her uncle\u2019s response to the coronavirus, saying \u2018he is dividing us at the expense of people\u2019s lives.\u2019 She then gave a dire forecast for the country if Trump is reelected in November. \u2018I absolutely believe [it] would be the end of the American experiment,\u2019 she said.\u201d\u00a0Mary Trump\u2019s book is making big numbers.\u00a0It has sold a staggering 950,000 copies by the end of its first day on sale, Simon & Schuster said, marking a new record for the publisher.

Speaking as he unveiled the first report of the Commission on Unalienable Rights, Pompeo said the events roiling the United States are antithetical to the nation\u2019s ideals. Both Pompeo and the 60-page report \u2026 said property rights and religious freedom are the foremost unalienable rights,\u201d Carol Morello reports. \u201cPompeo had harsh criticism for the New York Times\u2019s 1619 Project, on the history of American slavery, saying its underlying message was that \u2018our country was founded for human bondage.\u2019 \u2026 He also criticized protesters who have yanked down statues across the country, many of them erected in honor of Confederate officers in the Civil War but also enslaving founders of the nation. \u2026 \u2018This is a dark vision of America\u2019s birth. I reject it. It is a disturbed reading of history. It is a slander on our great people. Nothing could be further from the truth!\u2019 [he said]. \u2026\u00a0\u201cControversy has swirled around the commission since its creation. Its 11 members are predominantly professors and scholars. They include three women, one African American, one Asian, a rabbi and the president of a Muslim liberal arts college. Seven members are white men. \u2026 Some human rights groups immediately criticized Pompeo\u2019s remarks and the report. \u2026 Rob Berschinski, vice president of policy for Human Rights First, said Pompeo is trying to recast American foreign policy in line with his personal religious and political views.\u201dIn Portland, Department of Homeland Security officers cracked down on protesters.\u00a0\u201cFederal officers responded to one late-night demonstrations downtown by using gas, smoke and impact munitions to press protesters away from two federal buildings. The confrontation between federal officers and protesters came hours after interim DHS Secretary Chad Wolf arrived in Portland to meet with federal law enforcement officials,\u201d Oregon Live reports. \u201cWolf had issued a statement condemning the actions of some protesters during the seven weeks of demonstrations in Portland and referring to them as \u2018lawless anarchists.\u2019 Wolf said local and state elected leaders are failing to address the protests, which have continued for 50 straight nights since late May. \u2026 Oregon Gov. Kate Brown and Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler were among the elected leaders who called on federal officers to leave Portland. Both said they had no plans to meet with Wolf while he was in the city and Wheeler said he would decline if asked. Brown called the deployment of federal officers \u2018blatant abuse of power by the federal government.\u2019 \u2018This political theater from President Trump has nothing to do with public safety,\u2019 she said.\u201d\u00a0George Floyd\u2019s killing has already prompted some police departments to ban neck holds.\u00a0\u201cAt least 26 of the nation\u2019s 65 largest police departments have banned or strengthened restrictions on the use of neck restraints since [Floyd\u2019s death], a Post analysis shows,\u201d Ted Mellnik, Kevin Schaul and Kimberly Kindy report. \u201cA Post survey of the 65 largest U.S. police departments found 40 prohibit chokeholds in their use-of-force policies, while 38 prohibit carotid holds in those policies. These formal rules list the tactics and techniques officers may or may not use on suspects under various scenarios and can be critical tools in holding officers accountable. The survey examined the policies of the largest U.S. police departments by population served. Together, these departments serve almost 64 million Americans \u2014 about 20 percent of the nation\u2019s population.\u201dThe FBI is investigating Wednesday\u2019s Twitter hack.\u201cThe FBI will lead a federal inquiry into the hack, it said in a statement Thursday. Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo (D) directed New York state to start a probe of the incident, saying the hack is \u2018deeply troubling\u2019 particularly in light of the approaching elections,\u2019\u201d Rachel Lerman reports. \u201cA law enforcement official \u2026 said that the hackers do not seem to have been working for a foreign government and that the breach seemed all about getting money. \u2018This was not a hack of Biden\u2019s campaign,\u2019 the official said. \u2018Or of Elon Musk.

Subscribe today.arrow-rightFour years later, we\u2019re debating whether there\u2019s ever been a more powerful chief justice than John G. Roberts Jr., who has just completed a hugely consequential term in which he played the essential role. He was in the majority of every crucial decision and wrote many of them.\u201cIt is perhaps cliche by now to say the chief justice was the star of the term,\u201d said Washington lawyer Lisa S. Blatt, who appears frequently before the Supreme Court. \u00a0\u201cBut there is no other way to see the term: The chief took the bull by the horns and did what he wanted.\u201dWhat event reversed Roberts\u2019s fortunes? The election of Donald Trump in the fall of 2016. What might make Roberts\u2019s dominance short-lived? The reelection of Donald Trump in 2020.ADADIn fact, if you assumed the next two justices to leave the court would be its oldest, both liberals, the best-case scenario for a long Roberts reign would be the election of presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden. His replacements presumably would maintain the status quo.Being the Supreme Court\u2019s median justice \u2014 they hate being called the \u201cswing\u201d vote \u2014 requires more than smarts and savvy. It involves being in the right place at the right time \u2014 there must be four justices more consistently conservative and four justices more consistently liberal.Justice Sandra Day O\u2019Connor occupied that spot for years. After she left, and was replaced by someone more conservative, it was Justice Anthony M. Kennedy who took over the spotlight. And when Kennedy retired in 2018 and was replaced by someone more conservative, his protege Brett M. Kavanaugh, it was Roberts\u2019s turn in the middle.What was the Roberts court in name became the Roberts court in reality.But remember back to 2016. Justice Antonin Scalia died unexpectedly in February, seemingly giving President Barack Obama the chance to make his third Supreme Court nomination, after Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan. Obama\u2019s choice would have broken the court\u2019s stalemate of four conservative justices chosen by Republican presidents and four liberal ones picked by Democrats.ADADSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) gave conservatives at least a temporary reprieve. He said he would not allow the Senate to vote on a replacement and that the choice should be up to the next president. He made good on that promise, denying Obama\u2019s nominee, federal appeals court judge Merrick Garland, so much as a hearing.Still, few thought at the time the next president would be Trump. Most believed the next justice would be Garland or perhaps an even more liberal choice nominated by Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.A Democratic-appointed justice would have given the left a dominant role on the court for the first time in half a century. When the court split ideologically in such a makeup, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg \u2013 released this week from a hospital after a possible infection \u2013 would be the senior member in the majority, not the chief justice.ADADWe know how that turned out. Partly because he convinced evangelicals and other conservatives they could trust him on Supreme Court picks, Trump won three and half years ago. He chose Colorado federal appeals court judge Neil M. Gorsuch for the Scalia opening. And then Kavanaugh to replace Kennedy.The moves secured the court\u2019s conservative majority, and it put Roberts in the middle. \u00a0Roberts\u2019s alliances with the liberals this term made headlines: Together, they formed the five-justice majorities to stop the Trump administration from dismantling the Obama-era program protecting undocumented immigrants brought to the United States as children, and to cool the expectations of the antiabortion movement by striking down a restrictive Louisiana law.ADBut Roberts was also in the majority in all three cases that religious conservatives won this term. In fact, the court split 5-to-4 in 13 cases this term; Roberts and the other conservative justices made up the majority in nine of them.ADStill, Trump was not happy with his high-profile losses on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program and his claim he was untouchable by congressional investigators and a New York prosecutor. \u201cDo you get the impression that the Supreme Court doesn\u2019t like me?\u201d the president tweeted at one point.Trump emphasized the point last week during an interview with Fox News\u2019s Sean Hannity as a reason he should be reelected.AD\u201cWe need more judges and more justices,\u201d Trump said. \u201cYou see that now with the Supreme Court, more than ever. And the next president \u2014 I\u2019ve had two \u2014 and the next president is going to be able to pick two, or three, or one or whatever.\u201dRoberts is a savvy operator on the court no matter its makeup. Still, he remains in the central position so long as the justices a reelected Trump would replace are conservatives or the ones a President Biden would replace are liberals.ADThere\u2019s something to be said, of course, about reinforcing the status quo if either Trump or Biden are able to replace justices with like-minded successors. Gorsuch and Kavanaugh were roughly 30 years younger than the men they replaced and should have lengthy tenures on the court.ADConservative activists pushed the idea this spring that either Justice Clarence Thomas, 72, or Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr., 70, might be ready to leave, giving Trump the chance to name younger conservatives. McConnell has sworn to fill any opening that might arise.Anything can happen, but the term came and went without such announcements.On Election Day, the two oldest justices will be liberals: 87-year-old Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer, by then 82. Neither seems particularly eager to leave. \u00a0If Biden gets to replace either, he would be maintaining the status quo, albeit with a new generation. Roberts\u2019s place would seem to be secure.ADBut if Trump chooses a replacement for one of the liberals, it would shift the court\u2019s center of gravity considerably, and it would diminish Roberts\u2019s influence. As the most influential of five conservatives, the court moves to the right only as far and as quickly as the chief justice wants. The scenario changes if he were one of six.ADSo add this as another reason the coming presidential election will be so crucial.But keep something else in mind as well. Whether a president gets the chance to replace a Supreme Court justice is one of the least predictable events in American politics. And a justice\u2019s decision to leave usually is more about the justice than who\u2019s in the Oval Office.As Supreme Court wise man Walter E. Dellinger once said: \u00a0\u201cGenerally, it is God who decides whether presidents get Supreme Court appointments.\u201dThe coronavirusThe U.S. set a single-day record with more than 70,000 new coronavirus cases. Hospitals in the Sun Belt are strained.\u00a0\u201cIn California, doctors are \u00adshipping patients as many as 600 miles away because they can\u2019t be cared for locally. In Florida, nurses are pouring in from out of state to reinforce exhausted medical workers. And in Texas, mayors are demanding the right to shut down their cities to avoid overwhelming hospitals,\u201d Griff Witte and Rachel Weiner report. \u201cOfficials on Thursday said they are concerned that hospitals will soon hit a breaking point if the trajectory of ever-growing caseloads doesn\u2019t change. \u2018We can withstand a surge. We can withstand a disaster. But we can\u2019t withstand a disaster every single day,\u2019 said Jason Wilson, associate medical director of the emergency department at Tampa General Hospital \u2026 The peril was reflected in another grim set of data out of Florida on Thursday, with the state reporting a record number of deaths \u2014 156 \u2014 and adding nearly 14,000 new cases, its \u00adsecond-highest total to date. \u2026ADAD\u201cIn California, the worst effects were being felt in the southern part of the state, where hospitals have been inundated. In Imperial County, along the Mexican border, doctors have been so overwhelmed by the demand for care that they have begun sending patients as far away as Sacramento \u2014 a nine-hour drive to the north. \u2026 With medical staff in especially short supply, Defense Department teams began deploying to California hospitals this week to bolster the response. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R), meanwhile, requested that the Federal Emergency Management Agency send 1,500 nurses. Across Texas, mayors of some of the state\u2019s biggest cities \u2014 including Houston and Austin \u2014 are so worried about staffing needs at local hospitals that they have asked for the authority to reimpose stay-at-home orders.\"Nebraska, Utah and Oregon each shattered yesterday their previous single-day records of cases.\u00a0The total number of infections nationwide topped 3.5 million, with at least 135,000 deaths, per our tracker.\u00a0Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp\u2019s (R) administration went to court seeking to block Atlanta from enacting new restrictions and requiring residents to wear masks. A week ago, Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms (D) reverted to Phase 1 guidelines, pushing restaurants to close dining rooms and requiring masks. More than 100,000 Georgians have tested positive. (Atlanta Journal-Constitution)An outbreak shut down Florida\u2019s emergency operations center. An official said 13 people working there tested positive. (Isaac Stanley-Becker)Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) said \u201cthere is no shutdown coming\u201d as the state recorded 10,457 new cases. \"People are panicking, thinking I'm about to shut down Texas again,\" he said. \"The answer is no. That is not the goal. I've been abundantly clear.\" (Texas Tribune)The Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee has shrunk dramatically and has been rebranded under the slogan \u201cConvention Across America.\" While originally expected to draw 50,000 people, planners expect as few as 300 to show up \u2013 including media, security and DNC staff. Last evening, convention planners sent an email telling all members of Congress and delegates to stay away from the convention. All party business meetings will be conducted online. (NYT)Utah parents, in two meetings that featured few masks and little social distancing, protested a mandate by Gov. Gary Herbert (R) that would\u2019ve had their kids in masks and demanded in-person classes this fall. There are more than 30,000 confirmed cases in Utah, and the number is rising. (Salt Lake Tribune)Some teachers are saying they\u2019d rather quit than risk their health by going back to school. \u201cI love, love my job. But this? It\u2019s not worth my life,\u201d a Dallas-based teacher told BuzzFeed News. \u201cI\u2019m scared of getting sick and bringing it to my family. I\u2019m scared of dying. I think we all are, you know?\u201dPrivate schools are reopening even as the public schools in the same towns are not. In Honolulu, for example, public schools will remain closed but not the private Punahou, which has an on-staff epidemiologist. (NYT)Quote of the day\u201cWhen [Trump] says open, he means open in full, kids being able to attend each and every day in their school. The science should not stand in the way of this,\u201d said White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany on reopening schools. The U.S., she said, is an \u201coutlier\u201d among Western nations in terms of getting kids back to school. \"The science is on our side here and we encourage for localities and states to just simply follow the science, open our schools.\"\u00a0Americans\u2019 views of Trump\u2019s handling of the pandemic have deteriorated significantly, a new Post-ABC News poll found.\u201cThe Post-ABC poll shows 38 percent of Americans approve of his handling of the outbreak, down from 46 percent in May and 51 percent in March. Sixty percent disapprove, up from 53 percent in May and 45 percent in March,\u201d Scott Clement and Dan Balz report this morning. \u201cMore than half of the public\u201452 percent\u2014now disapproves \u2018strongly\u2019 of Trump\u2019s handling of the outbreak, roughly double the percentage who say they strongly approve of his efforts \u2026 A 63 percent majority say it is more important to try to control the spread of the virus even if it hurts the economy, up from 57 percent in May. \u2026 On the subject of masks, nearly 8 in 10 Americans say they are wearing one most or all of the time when they come close to others in public.\u201d\u00a0The disappearance of covid-19 data from the CDC\u2019s website spurred an outcry.\u00a0\u201cOn the eve of a new coronavirus reporting system this week, data disappeared from a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website as hospitals began filing information to a private contractor or their states instead. A day later, an outcry \u2014 including from other federal health officials \u2014 prompted the Trump administration to reinstate that dashboard and another daily CDC report on the pandemic,\u201d Lena Sun and Amy Goldstein report. \u201cAnd on Thursday, the nation\u2019s governors joined the chorus of objections over the abruptness of the change to the reporting protocols for hospitals, asking the administration to delay the shift for 30 days. In a statement, the National Governors Association said hospitals need the time to learn a new system, as they continue to deal with this pandemic. The governors also urged the administration to keep the information publicly available.\"A document prepared for the White House coronavirus task force suggests 18 states are in the \u2018red zone.\u2019\u00a0That means \u201cthey had more than 100 new cases per 100,000 population last week. Eleven states are in the \u2018red zone\u2019 for test positivity, meaning more than 10 percent of diagnostic test results came back positive,\u201d the Center for Public Integrity reports. \"The document has been shared within the federal government but does not appear to be posted publicly. Dr. Ashish Jha, director of the Harvard Global Health Institute, said he thought the information and recommendations were mostly good. \u2018The fact that it\u2019s not public makes no sense to me,\u2019 Jha said Thursday. \u2018Why are we hiding this information from the American people? This should be published and updated every day.\u2019\u201dThe White House warned that the next stimulus package \u201cmust\u201d include Trump\u2019s payroll tax cut proposal.\u201cTrump\u2019s renewed push for a payroll tax holiday comes as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) prepares to unveil legislation next week that he hopes will launch negotiations on the next major coronavirus bill. Key Republican senators have been cool to the idea of a payroll tax cut in the past, partly because it only helps workers who are actually employed. Congress has rebuffed Trump\u2019s previous demands for a payroll tax cut for individuals, instead approving a round of checks to individual Americans as part of the $2 trillion Cares Act in March,\u201d Erica Werner and Jeff Stein report. \u201cBut now, as Congress and the administration prepare to write what will probably be the last major coronavirus spending bill before the November election, Trump is again demanding a payroll tax cut. He and some allies view the policy as an effective way to stimulate the economy and quickly give workers a boost.\u201d \u00a0Russian cyberspies are trying to steal vaccine research, security officers in the U.S., Britain and Canada said.\u00a0\u201cThe hackers, who belong to a unit known variously as APT29, \u2018the Dukes\u2019 or \u2018Cozy Bear,\u2019 are targeting vaccine research and development organizations in the three countries, the officials said in a joint statement. The unit is one of the two Russian spy groups that penetrated the Democratic Party's computers in the lead-up to the 2016 presidential election,\u201d Ellen Nakashima, William Booth and Amanda Coletta report. \u201cOfficials did not divulge whether any of the Russian \u00adefforts have been successful, but, they said, the intention is clear. \u2018APT29 has a long history of targeting governmental, diplomatic, think tank, health-care and energy organizations for intelligence gain, so we encourage everyone to take this threat seriously and apply the mitigations issued in the advisory,\u2019 said Anne Neuberger, cybersecurity director for the U.S. National Security Agency.

Leaders in the region are monitoring the increasing caseload with an eye on avoiding spikes seen in other states,\u201d Julie Zauzmer and Dana Hedgpeth report. \u201cD.C. Health Director LaQuandra Nesbitt said three measurements in the city are cause for concern: the rate of transmission, a caseload that is not declining and a high prevalence of cases seemingly unconnected to one another, rather than traceable to one cluster of infections.\u201d \u00a0The D.C. health department will now announce July 31 whether schools will be allowed to reopen in the fall, or if they will need to go entirely virtual. (Perry Stein)The Nationals are exploring alternatives to Nationals Park because of D.C.\u2019s virus regulations. The main reason for the uncertainty is players, coaches and staff have to quarantine for 14 days if they are exposed to the novel coronavirus, per the city\u2019s health protocols. The District is unwilling to bend that requirement for the Nationals, Jesse Dougherty and Dave Sheinin report.The Washington teamFifteen former female Redskins employees said they were sexually harassed during their time at the club.\u201cA few months after Emily Applegate started working for the Washington Redskins in 2014, she settled into a daily routine: She would meet a female co-worker in the bathroom during their lunch breaks, she said, to commiserate and cry about the frequent sexual harassment and verbal abuse they endured,\u201d Will Hobson and Liz Clarke report. \u201cApplegate is one of 15 former female Redskins employees who told The Post they were sexually harassed during their time at the club. The other 14 women spoke on the condition of anonymity, citing a fear of litigation because some signed nondisclosure agreements with the team that threaten legal retribution if they speak negatively about the club. The team declined a request from The Post to release former female employees from these agreements so they could speak on the record without fear of legal reprisal. This story involved interviews with more than 40 current and former employees and a review of text messages and internal company documents.\u00a0\u201cTeam owner Daniel Snyder declined several requests for an interview. Over the past week, as The Post presented detailed allegations and findings to the club, three team employees accused of improper behavior abruptly departed, including Larry Michael, the club\u2019s longtime radio voice, and Alex Santos, the team\u2019s director of pro personnel. In a statement, the team said it had hired D.C. attorney Beth Wilkinson and her firm, Wilkinson Walsh, \u2018to conduct a thorough independent review of this entire matter and help the team set new employee standards for the future.\u2019 \u2026 The allegations raised by Applegate and others \u2014 running from 2006 to 2019 \u2014 span most of Snyder\u2019s tenure as owner and fall into two categories: unwelcome overtures or comments of a sexual nature, and exhortations to wear revealing clothing and flirt with clients to close sales deals. \u2026\u00a0\u201cNone of the women accused Snyder or former longtime team president Bruce Allen of inappropriate behavior with women, but they expressed skepticism that the men were unaware of the behavior they allege. \u2018I would assume Bruce [Allen] knew because he sat 30 feet away from me \u2026 and saw me sobbing at my desk several times every week,\u2019 Applegate said. Allen, who was fired at the end of last year, did not reply to interview requests. While Applegate and others did not accuse Snyder of acting improperly with women, they blamed him for an understaffed human resources department and what they viewed as a sophomoric culture of verbal abuse among top executives that they believed played a role in how those executives treated their employees.\u201d\u00a0Les Carpenter, who covers the team for The Post, drew five takeaways from the report, which comes as the team is in the midst of changing its historically problematic name. \u00a0The Trump presidencyRepublicans fear that the Trump campaign\u2019s shake-up won\u2019t counteract his self-sabotage.\u00a0\u201cNumerous Republicans and Trump allies said Thursday that the personnel overhaul \u2014 demoting Brad Parscale and replacing him with Bill Stepien as campaign manager \u2014 does little to address the main problem facing the struggling Trump campaign: the president himself and his chronically self-destructive behavior,\u201d Ashley Parker, Josh Dawsey and Robert Costa report. \u201cEven stalwarts are bewildered by what many view as his self-sabotaging actions, worried not only that he may lose in November but also that he will drag the rest of the party down with him. \u2026 Charlie Dent, a Republican former member of Congress from Pennsylvania, said Trump is out of step with members of his own party, especially those in tough reelection fights. \u2026 \u2018There\u2019s a total disconnect there between the president and those members in swing districts who need the president to be more measured and balanced \u2014 and, of course, he\u2019s totally incapable of that,\u2019 [he said]. Replacing the campaign manager, Dent continued, is hardly what most Republicans care about. \u2018It\u2019s all these other erratic and bizarre comments and behaviors that are causing the most heartburn for a lot of Republicans, by far\u2019 Dent said.\u201dMary Trump said she\u2019s heard her uncle Donald use the \u201cn-word\u201d and use anti-Semitic slurs.\u00a0The president\u2019s niece \u201cmade the allegation during an interview with MSNBC\u2019s Rachel Maddow,\u201d Colby Itkowitz reports. \u201cMaddow asked whether that was a generalization about her family\u2019s casual bigotry or if she\u2019d actually heard her uncle use racist language. \u2018Oh yeah, of course I did,\u2019 Mary Trump said. \u2018And I don\u2019t think that should surprise anybody given how virulently racist he is today.\u2019 \u2026 White House spokeswoman Sarah Matthews rebutted Mary Trump\u2019s allegation. \u2018This is a book of falsehoods, plain and simple,\u2019 Matthews said ... \u2018The President doesn\u2019t use those words.\u2019 \u2026 \u00a0In the Maddow interview, Mary Trump also slammed her uncle\u2019s response to the coronavirus, saying \u2018he is dividing us at the expense of people\u2019s lives.\u2019 She then gave a dire forecast for the country if Trump is reelected in November. \u2018I absolutely believe [it] would be the end of the American experiment,\u2019 she said.\u201d\u00a0Mary Trump\u2019s book is making big numbers.\u00a0It has sold a staggering 950,000 copies by the end of its first day on sale, Simon & Schuster said, marking a new record for the publisher. (CNN) \u00a0The Supreme Court dealt a blow to felons in Florida seeking to regain their right to vote.\u00a0The court declined to \u201coverturn a federal appeals court\u2019s decision that blocked some Florida felons\u2019 eligibility to participate in elections \u2014 a major blow to efforts to restore voting rights to as many as 1.4 million people in the battleground state,\u201d Amy Gardner and Lori Rozsa report. \u201cThree liberal justices noted their dissent, with Justice Sonia Sotomayor writing that the court\u2019s order \u2018prevents thousands of otherwise eligible voters from participating in Florida\u2019s primary election simply because they are poor.\u2019\u201d\u00a0Mike Pompeo said protesters and the mainstream media are attacking the American way of life.\u00a0The secretary of state said \u201cthe American way of life and its founding principles are \u2018under attack,\u2019 focusing his criticism on voices in the mainstream news media and protesters who have torn down statues of historical figures. Speaking as he unveiled the first report of the Commission on Unalienable Rights, Pompeo said the events roiling the United States are antithetical to the nation\u2019s ideals. Both Pompeo and the 60-page report \u2026 said property rights and religious freedom are the foremost unalienable rights,\u201d Carol Morello reports. \u201cPompeo had harsh criticism for the New York Times\u2019s 1619 Project, on the history of American slavery, saying its underlying message was that \u2018our country was founded for human bondage.\u2019 \u2026 He also criticized protesters who have yanked down statues across the country, many of them erected in honor of Confederate officers in the Civil War but also enslaving founders of the nation. \u2026 \u2018This is a dark vision of America\u2019s birth. I reject it. It is a disturbed reading of history. It is a slander on our great people. Nothing could be further from the truth!\u2019 [he said]. \u2026\u00a0\u201cControversy has swirled around the commission since its creation. Its 11 members are predominantly professors and scholars. They include three women, one African American, one Asian, a rabbi and the president of a Muslim liberal arts college. Seven members are white men. \u2026 Some human rights groups immediately criticized Pompeo\u2019s remarks and the report. \u2026 Rob Berschinski, vice president of policy for Human Rights First, said Pompeo is trying to recast American foreign policy in line with his personal religious and political views.\u201dIn Portland, Department of Homeland Security officers cracked down on protesters.\u00a0\u201cFederal officers responded to one late-night demonstrations downtown by using gas, smoke and impact munitions to press protesters away from two federal buildings. The confrontation between federal officers and protesters came hours after interim DHS Secretary Chad Wolf arrived in Portland to meet with federal law enforcement officials,\u201d Oregon Live reports. \u201cWolf had issued a statement condemning the actions of some protesters during the seven weeks of demonstrations in Portland and referring to them as \u2018lawless anarchists.\u2019 Wolf said local and state elected leaders are failing to address the protests, which have continued for 50 straight nights since late May. \u2026 Oregon Gov. Kate Brown and Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler were among the elected leaders who called on federal officers to leave Portland. Both said they had no plans to meet with Wolf while he was in the city and Wheeler said he would decline if asked. Brown called the deployment of federal officers \u2018blatant abuse of power by the federal government.\u2019 \u2018This political theater from President Trump has nothing to do with public safety,\u2019 she said.\u201d\u00a0George Floyd\u2019s killing has already prompted some police departments to ban neck holds.\u00a0\u201cAt least 26 of the nation\u2019s 65 largest police departments have banned or strengthened restrictions on the use of neck restraints since [Floyd\u2019s death], a Post analysis shows,\u201d Ted Mellnik, Kevin Schaul and Kimberly Kindy report. \u201cA Post survey of the 65 largest U.S. police departments found 40 prohibit chokeholds in their use-of-force policies, while 38 prohibit carotid holds in those policies.

The survey examined the policies of the largest U.S. police departments by population served. Together, these departments serve almost 64 million Americans \u2014 about 20 percent of the nation\u2019s population.\u201dThe FBI is investigating Wednesday\u2019s Twitter hack.\u201cThe FBI will lead a federal inquiry into the hack, it said in a statement Thursday. Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo (D) directed New York state to start a probe of the incident, saying the hack is \u2018deeply troubling\u2019 particularly in light of the approaching elections,\u2019\u201d Rachel Lerman reports. \u201cA law enforcement official \u2026 said that the hackers do not seem to have been working for a foreign government and that the breach seemed all about getting money. \u2018This was not a hack of Biden\u2019s campaign,\u2019 the official said. \u2018Or of Elon Musk.

Subscribe today.arrow-rightThe 80-page document, produced by a 15-person panel of Democratic leaders including allies of Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), was released Tuesday to party members in advance of a July 27 meeting of the full Platform Committee, a body of about 180 delegates who will have an opportunity to make amendments and then forward the document for ratification by the full Democratic convention next month.The draft recognizes in broad strokes the shift the party has undergone since 2016, with far more emphasis on issues such as climate change and police brutality, and a new proposal for a national commission to study slavery reparations and the lasting effects of other forms of institutionalized racism.ADAD\u201cWe must acknowledge that there can be no realization of the American Dream without grappling with the lasting effects of slavery, and facing up to the centuries-long campaign of violence, fear, and trauma wrought upon Black Americans,\u201d the draft reads.[Biden unveils plan for elder care, child care, universal preschool]In a nod to the protests against police brutality, the document supports \u201clowering the intent standard for federally prosecuting law enforcement officials for civil rights violations\u201d and \u201creining in the doctrine of qualified immunity,\u201d which protects police officers from civil litigation.Fiercely debated and rarely read, national party platforms are traditionally adopted every four years by both major political parties to help guide down-ballot candidates and aid voters in their quest for a preferred presidential candidate. They aspire to be consensus documents, but many party members regularly disagree with the particulars.ADADRepublicans, hoping to avoid intraparty squabbles, have abandoned the task of crafting a platform this year, leaving in place the dated 2016 document. President Trump is expected instead to release a short statement of intent in the place of a more formal document.Democrats have opted  for a more traditional process, although voting by the Platform Committee and the full convention will now take place remotely largely through email ballots.The drafting committee was chaired by Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms (D), who was joined by longtime party stalwarts including Richard Trumka, the president of the AFL-CIO, and Sen. Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.). The document also reflects the cooperative work of the Biden and Sanders campaigns, which produced a 110-page policy document earlier this month to guide the party.ADADPlatform drafters held three public hearings last month, listening to 50 public speakers, and reviewing thousands of videos, emails and messages providing comments on what should be included in the platform, according to party officials.[Trump calls for a \u2018new and updated\u2019 GOP platform after party moves to keep its 2016 document]\u201cRepairing the damage Donald Trump has done to this country begins with electing Joe Biden this fall and implementing what will be without a doubt the boldest platform in our party\u2019s history,\u201d Bottoms said in a statement. \u201cProgress is rarely easy, but together we can move our country forward and resign Donald Trump to the dustbin of history.\u201dADThe draft sticks with the broad policy priorities of Biden, who is expected to be nominated next month at a largely virtual convention in Milwaukee. But it also makes a point of casting the Democratic Party as accepting of views he does not hold and has said he will not promote.AD\u201cWe are proud our party welcomes advocates who want to build on and strengthen the Affordable Care Act and those who support a Medicare-for-all approach,\u201d the draft reads, \u201call are critical to ensuring that health care is a human right.\u201dOn matters of international trade, Democrats offer particular focus on taking a tougher stand on China. \u201cUnlike President Trump, we will stand up to efforts from China and other state actors to steal America\u2019s intellectual property and will demand China and other countries cease and desist from conducting cyberespionage against our companies,\u201d the draft reads.ADIn an apparent nod to opposition from some building trades unions, the draft platform does not address the question of fracking or oil drilling directly. Biden has proposed a ban on new public leases for natural gas fracking, attracting criticism from Republicans in swing states such as Wisconsin and Pennsylvania.AD\u201cThe Democratic Party platform does not call for banning fracking \u2014 consistent with Joe Biden\u2019s long-standing position,\u201d Biden campaign spokesman Andrew Bates said. Most fracking is conducted on private land, which would be untouched by Biden\u2019s position.The draft also embraces some technologies for slowing climate change, like nuclear and carbon capture and storage, which are opposed by some activists and environmentalists.ADOn the question of military spending, the document does not shy away from the threatened attacks from Trump, who has boasted of increases in defense spending and warned that Democrats would weaken the military.\u201cWe can maintain a strong defense and protect our safety and security for less,\u201d the draft reads. \u201cIt\u2019s past time to rebalance our investments, improve the efficiency and competitiveness of our defense industrial base, conduct rigorous annual audits of the Pentagon, and end waste and fraud.\u201dADIt also embraces Biden\u2019s promise to end  what have been called \u201cforever wars\u201d in places like Afghanistan, while ending U.S. support for the Saudi-led war in Yemen. It calls for rejoining the Paris climate accord and reentering the Iran nuclear agreement.\u201cDemocrats believe the United States should not impose regime change on other countries and reject that as the goal of U.S. policy toward Iran,\u201d the document states.\n\nAnnie Linskey, Matt Viser and Sean Sullivan contributed to this report.", "comment": "220 Comments", "topic": "Politics"}, {"cover": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/YKNN5OWKIMI6VGNQQQTOE3JAHM.jpghttps://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/YKNN5OWKIMI6VGNQQQTOE3JAHM.jpg", "title": "Power Up: Unemployment benefits a key sticking point in coronavirus relief negotiations as deadline looms", "date": "Jul 20, 2020", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/07/20/power-up-unemployment-benefits-key-sticking-point-coronavirus-relief-negotiations-deadline-looms/", "keyword": "presidential election and trade war", "website": "the Washington Post", "author": "Jacqueline Alemany", "content": "with Brent D.

Subscribe today.arrow-rightThe PoliciesCLOCK IS TICKING: More than 30 million Americans are about to lose enhanced unemployment benefits if Congress doesn't act to extend them in the next coronavirus relief package.\u00a0The benefits are poised to be a key point of contention as Democrats insist the extra $600-per-week is a crucial lifeline given that the June unemployment rate, even down to 11.1 percent from its April peak, remains worse than at any other point in recent history \u2014 and Republicans seek to limit the overall cost of the relief package.\u00a0ADIt was controversial from the time it was passed in March, since the size of the unemployment benefit is equal to or greater than the minimum wage in most states. Key Trump administration officials and Republican lawmakers have called the supercharged unemployment benefit \u2014 Federal Pandemic Unemployment Assistance \u2014 a disincentive for people to return to work.\u00a0ADSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is expected to introduce a $1 trillion stimulus bill this week that would include a limited unemployment benefit: \u201cWe made a mistake when we overpaid on unemployment insurance where now it\u2019s hard for people to come back to work because they\u2019re making more on unemployment than they can working,\u201d House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) said on \u201cSunday Morning Futures.\u201d \u201cSo we\u2019ve got to straighten that out as we move forward.\u201d\u00a0The White House also appears to be against extending the benefit at the current level: \u201cFrom numerous conversations with people at the White House \u2014 they do understand redoing this $600-per-week benefit would be really bad for the economy and really bad in the fall, when you need the recovery,\u201d Stephen Moore, a conservative analyst and White House ally, told our colleagues Jeff Stein, Andrew Van Dam and Eli Rosenberg last week. \u201cThe stakes are really enormous here.\u201dBut advisers acknowledge the optics of ending the benefit are charged: \u201cSome people are asking me, \u2018Why are you getting rid of unemployment benefits when you still have a lot of unemployment?\u2019 The answer is, \u2018We\u2019re not,\u2019 \u201d Larry Kudlow, the director of the National Economic Council, told Fox Business on Friday. \u201cWe\u2019re not getting rid of unemployment benefits. Now, a couple of things \u2014 we are looking at various ways to cap total unemployment benefits \u2014 federal and state and local. We\u2019re looking at various ways to do that.\u201dKudlow has said President Trump favors a more limited measure that \u201cwill not be as large and will create an incentive to work.\u201dTalks are happening today: McConnell and McCarthy are expected to discuss the relief efforts with Trump and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. The unemployment benefits are set to end as soon as this week.Possible compromises: \u201cWith a substantial number of conservative Republicans wary of spending too much additional federal money, GOP lawmakers have discussed proposing the federal benefit be cut from an additional $600 per week to between $200 per week and $400 per week,\u201d Jeff Stein and Erica Werner report. \u201cThe lower number is viewed as the likelier outcome in their bill, although aides cautioned negotiations are fluid and details remain in flux.\u201d\u00a0ADRemember: \u201cHouse Democrats passed a bill in May that would extend the $600-per-week threshold through January 2021. That bill would increase spending by roughly $3 trillion, and Trump threatened to veto it.\u201dBut Trump has demands of his own: A payroll tax cut \u2014 which has so far during coronavirus relief negotiations earned few fans in Congress \u2014 and liability protections for businesses, which McConnell has called for but Democrats oppose.\u00a0AD\u201cI would consider not signing it if we don\u2019t have a payroll tax cut,\u201d Trump said on \u201cFox News Sunday,\u201d insisting that \u201ca lot of Republicans like it.\u201dAnother idea discussed by congressional Republicans to lower the price tag of the relief bill: To \u201celiminate or curb the amount of additional federal unemployment benefits allocated to people who earned above a certain income threshold before losing their jobs,\u201d our colleagues write. \u201cExactly what that number could be remains unclear. Republicans are exploring similar measures to target another round of $1,200 stimulus payments for those toward the bottom of the income distribution, although it\u2019s unclear how that would combine with Trump\u2019s insistence on a payroll tax cut.\u201d\u00a0Big picture: \u201cIf the White House and Senate GOP priorities make it into the bill, the legislation would effectively cut taxes for people who have jobs while cutting benefits for the unemployed,\u201d according to our colleagues Jeff and Erica.\u00a0Democrats insist that the benefits are necessary to keep workers and families above the poverty line, especially as the number of workers who permanently lost their jobs is rising.\u00a0ADBy the numbers: \u201cNearly 17.4 million workers were continually claiming unemployment insurance for the week ended July 4, the Labor Department said. Another 14.3 million people were claiming Pandemic Unemployment Assistance, the program newly created for self-employed or gig workers who are out of work at the moment, bringing the total number of people on all programs to 32 million unemployed,\u201d our colleague Eli Rosenberg reported on Friday.\u00a0Millions of Americans are struggling, as historic demand for another program attests to: \u201cMore than six million people enrolled in food stamps in the first three months of the pandemic, an unprecedented expansion that is likely to continue as more jobless people deplete their savings and billions in unemployment aid expires this month,\u201d the New York Times's Jason DeParle reports.More trouble coming: The surge of infections have caused some states to close back up again, which adds to concerns from financial institutions that the worst economic pain may be yet to come \u2014 and companies predictions that even deeper job losses may hit in the fall.\u00a0ADLos Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti (D) said his city is \u201con the brink\u201d of another stay-home order. Miami Mayor Francis Suarez (R) said last week that he may soon have to order another shutdown of nonessential businesses in his city. Meanwhile, Texas has already ordered bars to shutter for a second time.In corporate America, fears are growing that contingency plans may need to account for years instead of just months. \u201cThe pandemic has a grip on the economy, and it doesn\u2019t seem likely to loosen until vaccines are widely available,\u201d Citigroup Chief Executive Michael Corbat told the Wall Street Journal's Ben Eisen and David Benoit.\u201cThere are signs that job losses are reaching deeper into the economy as well,\u201d Eli reports. \u201cAmerican Airlines warned that 25,000 employees \u2014 about 29 percent of its staff \u2014 could be furloughed in the fall. General Motors said it would furlough about a third of its workers, 1,250 people, from its Wentzville Assembly plant in Ohio.\u201dMeanwhile, Wall Street continues to record modest gains, an odd juxtaposition that continues to perplex some market watchers.Some economists predict that without an extension of the enhanced unemployment, the economy would shrink by the end of the year.\u00a0\u201cFull expiration would mean an economy that is 2% smaller by the end of 2020, and with 1.7 million fewer jobs, than if the FPUC were extended,\u201d Ernie Tedeschi, a former economist at the U.S. Treasury under President Obama, tweeted.\u00a0\u201cEven a partial compromise \u2014 $300 per week for the rest of the year \u2014 would still be an economy 1% smaller by year-end with 800,000 fewer jobs \u2026 And those are just aggregate figures,\u201d Tedeschi continued. \u201cAt the individual level, workers would be devastated if the FPUC expired. Almost overnight, their incomes would be cut in half. In states like Arizona, Louisiana, and Mississippi, the typical worker would lose 75% of her benefits.\u201d\u00a0Election year politics have complicated negotiations within the Republican Party. McConnell must balance \u201ccompeting demands from [Trump] and Republican senators, including some who are up for reelection in states hit hard by the virus and are coming under withering attacks by Democratic challengers over the pandemic,\u201d Seung Min Kim, Rachael Bade and Erica Werner report.\u00a0ADFor instance, endangered Republican Sen. Cory Gardner \u2014 in a tough race against former Colorado governor John Hickenlooper (D) \u2014 says he backs extending the enhanced unemployment benefit, though he's open to it being less than $600 per week. \u201cWe have to \u2014 together \u2014 get through this by making sure that people are able to get back to work, that businesses are able to survive, that individuals know that they\u2019re going to be okay,\u201d Gardner told our colleagues.\u00a0ADGardner also \u201csaid he is also open to Democrats\u2019 demands for more aid for states and localities, although he didn\u2019t specify how much. McConnell\u2019s proposal, as of now, is not expected to include new money for state and local aid, but rather flexibility for how cities, states and towns use their existing aid.\u201dThere are other controversial cuts to the relief bill the Trump administration is vying for that has even angered GOP senators. The administration is currently \u201ctrying to block billions of dollars for states to conduct testing and contact tracing in the upcoming coronavirus relief bill, people involved in the talks said Saturday,\u201d Jeff and Erica write this weekend.\u00a0\u201cThe administration is also trying to block billions of dollars that GOP senators want to allocate for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and billions more for the Pentagon and State Department to address the pandemic at home and abroad, the people said \u2026 [S]ome lawmakers are trying to push back and ensure that the money stays in the bill.\u201d\u00a0AD \n  \n  \n  You are reading the Power Up newsletter. \n  Not a regular subscriber? \n   \n   \n    \n   \n   \n  \n \nOn The HillDEMS PUSH EXPANDING VOTING RIGHTS AFTER JOHN LEWIS'S DEATH: \u201cDemocratic lawmakers said that they don\u2019t want tweets or condolences to honor civil rights icon \u2026 They want policymakers to get to work to honor the Georgia congressman\u2019s legacy,\u201d Cat Zakrzewski and Haisten Willis report.ADLawmakers focused on two areas: Restoring key protections of the Voting Rights Act and renaming the bridge named after former Confederate general and Ku Klux Klan leader Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Ala., where state troopers and local law enforcement violently beat Lewis and 57 other people during a peaceful march for voting rights in 1965.\u00a0\u201cIt should be the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Act of 2020,\u201d House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn said on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s the way to do it. Words may be powerful, but deeds are lasting.\u201d\u00a0ADFor context: Congress has been unable to agree on how to amend the landmark law after the Supreme Court struck down a major section of it in 2013, saying it was no longer needed, a 5-4 decision that Lewis, President Obama and other top Democrats widely panned. The House passed legislation restoring those protections last December, but only one Republican lawmaker voted in favor of the bill.\u00a0As for the bridge: Efforts to rename the bridge have previously been unsuccessful, including a 2015 bill in the Alabama state legislature \u2014 though Lewis was not the suggested replacement at the time.\u00a0Rep. Terri Swell (D-Ala.), whose district includes Selma, told the New York Times, \u201cWhile I personally can think of no better name than that of John Lewis, I ultimately believe the Selma community should decide who it is named after.\"\u00a0REMEMBERING A CIVIL RIGHTS ICON: Funeral arrangements and memorial services are still being planned: Some lawmakers want to see Lewis lie in state, which would just be the second time in American history a black person would be honored in such a way. But the pandemic is complicating those efforts as the U.S. Capitol remains closed to the public, the Times's Luke Broadwater reports.\u00a0AD\u201cJohn Lewis, a civil rights leader who preached nonviolence while enduring beatings and jailings during seminal front-line confrontations of the 1960s and later spent more than three decades in Congress defending the crucial gains he had helped achieve for people of color, has died. He was 80,\u201d Laurence I. Barrett writes in Lewis's Post obit.Congress's moral compass: \u201cLewis harnessed his own history, beaten by state troopers in Selma, Ala., as he and other peaceful protesters tried to march across the Edmund Pettus Bridge, and turned it into a moral calling on Capitol Hill. Every year, he led dozens of members of Congress to a weekend pilgrimage to Selma that served as an educational retreat to learn of the civil rights struggle and culminated with a soul-replenishing trip with Lewis across the bridge where he had nearly died in 1965,\u201d Paul Kane writes of the congressman's nearly 34 years in the House.\u00a0ADIn photos: Our colleagues put together a poignant gallery of images throughout Lewis's life.In his own words: the Associated Press compiled some of Lewis's most powerful quotes.And on his own legacy: \u201cMy philosophy is very simple, when you see something that is not right, not fair, not just, say something, do something. Get in trouble, good trouble, necessary trouble,\u201d Lewis says in the aptly named and recently released \u201cGood Trouble,\u201d \u00a0a documentary about his life which is available for rent on a number of streaming platforms.His last public appearance: He accompanied D.C.

Bowser to view the then-newly renamed Black Lives Matter Plaza leading up to the White House.\u00a0ADThe scene there after his death: \u201cNearly six weeks after the civil rights icon stepped foot onto Black Lives Matter Plaza in what would become his last public appearance, the area blossomed into a memorial of music, reflection and gratitude for Lewis on Saturday in the wake of his death,\u201d Emily Davies reports.At The White HouseMORE FROM TRUMP'S INTERVIEW: \u201c[Trump] said that the rising number of U.S. deaths from the coronavirus \u2018is what it is,\u2019 defended his fumbled management of the pandemic with a barrage of dubious and false claims, and revealed his lack of understanding about the fundamental science of how the virus spreads and infects people,\u201d Philip Rucker and Felicia Sonmez report.Some other highlights:\u00a0Trump refused to say whether he would accept the election's results: \u201cI have to see. Look, you \u2014 I have to see,\u201d the president said to repeated questions on the topic.ADHe promised to release a new health care plan in two weeks: \u201cWe're signing a health care plan within two weeks,\u201d the president said. \u201cA full and complete health care plan that the Supreme Court decision on DACA gave me the right to do. So we're going to solve \u2014 we're going to sign an immigration plan, a health care plan, and various other plans. And nobody will have done what I'm doing in the next four weeks.\u201d (Republicans famously could not agree on a plan to repeal and replace Obamacare in 2017.ADAnd Trump continued to threaten to veto funding for the military over the issue of renaming bases named after Confederate generals: \u201cFort Bragg is a big deal. We won two World Wars, nobody even knows General Bragg. We won two World Wars. Go to that community where Fort Bragg is, in a great state, I love that state, go to the community, say how do you like the idea of renaming Fort Bragg, and then what are we going to name it?\u201d Trump said.He then added this: \u201cWe're going to name it after the Reverend Al Sharpton? What are you going to name it Chris, tell me what you're going to name it?\u201dWallace pushed back on the idea that the cognitive test Trump \u2013 some of which claimed was \u201cvery hard\u201d \u2013 was truly that difficult: \u201cIt's not the hard - it's not the hardest test,\u201d Wallace told the president. \u201cThey have a picture and is says, \u2018what\u2019s that' and it's an elephant.\u201d\u00a0ALLIES ARE STARTING TO BREAK RANKS: \u201cOnce-reticent Republican governors are now issuing orders on mask-wearing and business restrictions that run counter to Trump\u2019s demands. Some of those governors have been holding late-night phone calls among themselves to trade ideas and grievances; they have sought out partners in the administration other than the president, including Vice President Pence, who, despite echoing Trump in public, is seen by governors as far more attentive to the continuing disaster,\u201d the Times's Alexander Burns, Jonathan Martin and Maggie Haberman report.Ouch: \u201cThe president got bored with it,\u201d David Carney, an adviser to Texas governor Greg Abbott (R) said of Trump's response \u00a0to the pandemic. He noted that Abbott, a Republican, directs his requests to Pence, with whom he speaks two to three times a week.The CampaignBIDEN URGED TO THROW OUT VEEP PLAYBOOK: \u201cAs Biden enters the final stretch of a decidedly unconventional search process \u2014 he has promised to pick a woman, and is vetting several African American contenders who would make history amid a growing racial justice movement \u2014 the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee is facing growing pressure to break from an old playbook that has resulted in white men being tapped all but two times in the country\u2019s history,\u201d Vanessa Williams and Sean Sullivan report.Key quote: \u201cHopefully the political class will have evolved sufficiently to understand that some of the rules that they set out are no longer applicable,\u201d Carol Moseley Braun (D-Ill.), who in 1992 became the first black woman elected to the Senate, told our colleagues. \u201cThe fact of the matter is we\u2019ve never had black women in a lot of these positions so how can you go to say experience in it is the prerequisite? Otherwise, what you get is that old circular firing squad and you wind up never getting anybody.\u201dFor context: \u201cOnly two black women have ever been elected to the Senate and none have ever won a governorship \u2026 Since Shirley Chisholm (D-N.Y.) became the first black woman elected to Congress in 1968, 47 black women have served in Congress.

Subscribe today.arrow-rightBut the last thing the Fultons expected was to find themselves angrily marching out of the event after being there for only 20 minutes.The cause of their sudden exit? West declaring onstage that famed abolitionist Harriet Tubman, who has been called \u201cthe Moses of her people,\u201d \u201cnever actually freed the slaves.\u201d\u201cShe just had the slaves go work for other white people,\u201d West said. Loud groans and unintelligible murmuring immediately erupted from the large crowd of several hundred people who had gathered at the Exquis Event Center. \u201cCome on, man,\u201d a voice shouted out.ADADMeanwhile, the Fulton sisters, who are black, decided they had seen enough. In a now-viral video capturing West\u2019s comment, Toni Fulton made her exasperation with the Grammy Award-winning artist clear in a single statement. \u201cYo, we leavin\u2019 right now,\u201d she could be heard saying in the background of the short clip as it abruptly cut off.\u201cWe\u2019re young, black women and there weren\u2019t a lot of us in the room,\u201d Fulton, 30, told The Washington Post. \u201cWe know better than to be in a space that we\u2019re not uplifted in. While he was saying a lot of crazy things that didn\u2019t directly offend us, that was offensive and it wasn\u2019t appropriate for us to be there anymore.\u201dWest, who is trying to get on the ballot in South Carolina, spoke for about an hour during Sunday\u2019s freewheeling campaign rally, bouncing between a variety of subjects ranging from abortion and religion to international trade. But his claim about Tubman swiftly became the most-talked-about moment from the event. Video clips circulated widely online, prompting critics and historians to share facts about Tubman\u2019s storied legacy and urge West, who faced intense backlash in 2018 for saying 400 years of African American enslavement sounded \u201clike a choice,\u201d to educate himself.ADADBy early Monday, \u201cKanye\u201d and Tubman\u2019s name were still top trending terms on Twitter as social media exploded with reactions to his remarks, which one prominent Tubman scholar decried as \u201ccompletely irrational\u201d in an interview with The Washington Post.\u201cThere\u2019s something about that little, petite, black woman, who did so much, that seems to bother him,\u201d said Kate Clifford Larson, author of the 2003 biography \u201cBound for the Promised Land: Harriet Tubman, Portrait of an American Hero.\u201d Larson noted that West has referenced the abolitionist critically in past years.\u201cShe put up with a lot of abuse her whole life,\u201d Larson said of Tubman. \u201cShe\u2019s getting the attention and accolades that she deserves. Why tear her down now? It\u2019s just ridiculous.\u201dADRepresentatives for West did not respond to requests for comment late Sunday.The renewed backlash over West\u2019s interpretation of history comes as he is attempting to collect the 10,000 signatures needed by noon Monday to appear on the South Carolina ballot, the Associated Press reported. West, 43, announced July 4 on Twitter that he was mounting a long-shot bid for the presidency, even though the deadline to get his name on ballots in several states had already passed. Still, West recently managed to qualify for the general election ballot in Oklahoma \u2014 and political experts have warned that it would be a mistake to ignore the hitmaker, citing the influence third-party candidates have had on past elections, The Post\u2019s Helena Andrews-Dyer reported.AD\u201cPeople want to dismiss the irrational,\u201d pollster Terrance Woodbury told Andrews-Dyer. \u201cIt sounded irrational five years [ago] that Donald Trump would be president. It\u2019s only crazy until someone pulls it off.\u201d\u2018I do not want to take Kanye West seriously. But I know that we have to.\u2019For Fulton, West\u2019s fledgling presidential run bears marked similarities to President Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign, and the Columbia, S.C., native told The Post on Sunday that she and her sister, both Democrats, felt the North Charleston rally \u201cjust seemed like a moment that we shouldn\u2019t miss.\u201dAD\u201cShe sent a text that said, \u2018Hey, do you want to see the circus?\u2019\u201d Fulton said.It didn\u2019t take Fulton long to determine that West\u2019s rally wouldn\u2019t be like any other standard campaign event. First, she said she noticed that the crowd was mostly young people and \u201csneakerheads,\u201d sporting their distinctive pricey footwear, while other attendees arrived wearing concert T-shirts.ADPerhaps, she thought, West would perform a few of his songs during his first official introduction as a presidential candidate. She anticipated that the event, albeit not a typical rally, would \u201cintroduce the world to the professional, presidential side of Kanye West.\u201dInstead, the rapper strode onstage a few minutes after 5 p.m. wearing a protective vest that had \u201cSECURITY\u201d emblazoned across the front. \u201c2020\u201d was shaved into his head.AD\u201cIn this Black Lives Matter spirit, to have a militarized outfit was, I don\u2019t know, read the room,\u201d said Fulton, noting the protests over racism and police brutality that have consumed the nation for weeks. \u201cIt was weird.\u201dAnd things only proceeded to get weirder, according to live-streamed footage of the event.Speaking without a microphone, West brought members of the crowd onstage, appearing to use their thoughts on current events to drive the conversation. He addressed his past support of Trump and his days of wearing a Make America Great Again hat, acknowledging that it was a \u201cvery, very hurtful moment\u201d for fans. West went on to argue that \u201cDemocrats ain\u2019t did s--- for blacks\u201d and disputed criticism that his candidacy would split black votes, calling the idea \u201cthe most racist thing that\u2019s ever been said out loud.\u201dADADThen, he appeared to abruptly shift gears to Tubman. Ignoring the crowd\u2019s audible reaction to his comments about Tubman\u2019s efforts to free enslaved people, West segued into criticizing economic equality.\u201cNational Basketball Association is not owned by any blacks. Universal Music is not owned by any blacks,\u201d he said. \u201cAny celebrity that you see talking is not the real power because the real power \u2026 you don\u2019t see them.\u201dBut at that point, Fulton and her sister were already headed for the door.\u201cWe just left,\u201d she said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want to be there any longer because it\u2019s a joke. That\u2019s what it felt like.\u201dShe described West\u2019s comments as an attempt to \u201ctotally take away everything that Harriet Tubman did\u201d for African Americans, adding, \u201cI don\u2019t even think I\u2019ve heard white people say that.\u201dADOn social media, the brief remark was met with similar criticism led by prominent black voices and historians.AD\u201cYou, Mr. West are a jerk and not worthy of uttering Tubman\u2019s name,\u201d Larson, the Tubman scholar, tweeted. \u201cYou have not freed anyone.\u201dCivil rights attorney Benjamin Crump wrote in a tweet addressed to West that \u201ca Black history textbook is in the mail.\u201d\u201cRead it, then learn to respect Harriet Tubman\u2019s legacy,\u201d Crump added.In a statement to The Post, Erica Armstrong Dunbar, a Rutgers University professor who specializes in African American women\u2019s history, echoed calls for West to become better educated.\u201cKanye West is in desperate need of a crash course in American History. His comments were erroneous and serve as a pathetic attempt to stimulate public attention,\u201d Dunbar said, calling Tubman a \u201chero.\u201dADRegarded as \u201cthe most well-known of all the Underground Railroad\u2019s \u2018conductors,\u2019\u201d Tubman made more than a dozen trips to the South over the course of a decade, escorting hundreds of enslaved people to freedom, according to PBS. During the Civil War, Tubman worked as a nurse and a scout for the Union, and became the first woman to lead an armed and successful military attack at the time, Dunbar told The Post. Later in her life, Tubman was also an advocate for women\u2019s suffrage.ADThere is now an ongoing effort to get Tubman on the $20 bill, in place of former president Andrew Jackson, who was an enslaver.\u201cTubman was one of the most important social justice activists in our nation\u2019s history and West\u2019s words will never erase this fact,\u201d Dunbar said. \u201cHe\u2019s a distraction and I suggest we move along and pay him no mind.\u201dHarriet Tubman is already appearing on $20 bills whether Trump officials like it or notBut though Brenda E. Stevenson, a professor of history and African American studies at the University of California at Los Angeles, agreed that West\u2019s comments were \u201cwoefully uninformed,\u201d she stressed that his influence should not be entirely discounted.\u201cHe\u2019s a celebrity and he has a great following of young people in particular,\u201d Stevenson told The Post. \u201cSome may be as uninformed as he is and believe that what he says is true, so that\u2019s what\u2019s disturbing to me.AD\u201cThis country has a real problem with knowing African American history,\u201d she continued. \u201cSo when you have someone who has a great following say something that really is not based in fact, then it really distorts the history even more.\u201dInstead, she urged people to do their own research.\u201cQuestion what you read on social media. Question it deeply,\u201d she said, \u201cAll the information is available to us, literally at our fingertips.

Subscribe today.arrow-rightNo, the Supreme Court didn't abolish Oklahoma today, and this is The Trailer.The last time Joe Biden appeared on a presidential ticket, the Democratic Party's platform contained no mention of marijuana. Its health-care language focused on the Affordable Care Act, suggesting that the fight for universal coverage was pretty much won. It promised to \u201cfight inequalities in our criminal justice system,\u201d without spelling out how, and urged that when the death penalty is used, it should \u201cnot be arbitrary.\u201dADBiden is happily inheriting a party that has moved to the left, without interruption, since he left the vice presidency. The report this week from his Unity Task Force, the product of a deal between the nominee and primary runner-up Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), found Biden's team inching a little further in that direction \u2014 cautious, careful with its wording, but dramatically different from the politics that defined much of Biden's career.AD\u201cI think the compromise that they came up with, if implemented, will make Biden the most progressive president since FDR,\u201d Sanders said in a Wednesday night interview with MSNBC's Chris Hayes.\u00a0Republicans quickly repurposed Sanders's answer to describe Biden as a catspaw for the country's resurgent socialist movements. \u201cThis is surrendering to the\u00a0socialists,\u201d House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) said in a Thursday interview on Fox News. The Republican National Committee highlighted sentences taken directly from some of Sanders's campaign white papers to accuse Biden of \u201cplagiarism,\u201d a charge that evoked his botched 1988 presidential campaign, if not quite describing a task force designed to merge platforms.ADBut the basic Republican critique was right. Biden, seen by voters as the most moderate of their two dozen or so options in the primary, has welcomed a shift away from the careful politics Democrats deployed, for decades, to mollify suburban voters. Under his proposals, millions of voters are offered a new government health-care plan, and millions more are offered federal housing and housing assistance. Tax cuts, emphasized for years to convince swing voters, aren't prioritized.AD\u201cIn 2008, one of the things we had to constantly fight in places like the I-4 corridor was taxes,\u201d said Steve Schale, an Obama-Biden campaign veteran who's now a strategist for the pro-Biden super PAC Unite the Country, referring to a vote-rich stretch of Florida cities and suburbs. \u201cI bet you we ran more ads about Barack Obama cutting middle-class taxes than anything. We had to win that fight. Our ad strategy was built around keeping that fight neutral.\u201dTough-on-crime politicking has been de-emphasized, too. The party's 2012 platform did not mention the \u201cwar on drugs.\u201d The 2016 platform, reshaped by Sanders delegates, condemned the drug war for the \u201cimprisonment of millions of Americans, disproportionately people of color.\u201d The task force's paper, with Biden's name at the top, pledges to \u201cend the failed \u2018War on Drugs\u2019 \u201d entirely.ADThat's still less than Sanders and his allies wanted, and skepticism of the task force, from the beginning, assumed that Biden would invite the left inside his tent to make it less relevant but not deliver. The task force does not recommend a right to strike for public workers, a right that the left wants but that is not favored by leadership of the biggest public-sector union. It recommends the legalization of medical marijuana but not the full legalization now favored by most voters. And criminal justice reform advocates noticed that the task force recommended only that qualified immunity, which protects police from lawsuits, be \u201creined in,\u201d not ended.\u00a0ADEven so, that's more than Biden needed to offer to the left and Sanders supporters, and more than most defeated candidates have gotten. While Sanders won just 29 percent of pledged delegates throughout the primaries, he appointed 40 percent of the task force, giving him more influence on a high-profile set of recommendations that will shape the party's platform than he was going to get on the platform itself. While Sanders's path was vanishing by early April, his decision to drop out gave Biden three months as the de facto nominee, instead of the drawn-out contest feared by Democrats. And polling by the New York Times and Siena has found just a handful of Sanders supporters, and no Warren supporters, frustrated enough by the primary to consider backing President Trump.Sanders's interest in the platform of a party he does not belong to has been one of the senator's great contradictions. In primary mode, he has excoriated the party's \u201cestablishment.\u201d When the 2016 and 2020 primaries were over, he focused intensely on changing the party's official positioning, even though nothing binds a party to govern on its platform.ADThe secrecy of the task forces prevented the sort of messy, televised fight that Democrats went through in 2016, when Sanders supporters in an Orlando hotel ballroom shouted \u201cshame!\u201d if a Sanders plank was voted down. It has given the left a tool to use in whatever form these platform discussions take.\u00a0ADWhile Medicare-for-all proponents made up a majority of the health-care task force, they did not try to put Biden on record for a policy he famously considers unworkable. They did successfully urge a major revision to his health-care plan, calling for poor people not eligible for Medicaid to be \u201cautomatically enrolled\u201d in a public health-care option \u2014 a change from Biden's proposal that new enrollees join through interactions with other government programs.None of this made it into Biden's Thursday economic speech near Scranton, Pa., the centerpiece of a days-long policy rollout that was delayed by a month of civil rights protests. That speech emphasized a \u201cbuy American\u201d proposal adopted in part from Elizabeth Warren's (D-Mass.) campaign, to the consternation of some Trump allies, who wanted the president to move first on a similar policy.ADBut the Republican response to the task force didn't spend much time on the details, either. It has become a frequent feature of this campaign: The Trump campaign incorrectly assigned a far-left position to Biden, making a position that he holds, one that's merely much further left than the Obama-Biden platform, sound more moderate. The task force's climate plan, shaped in part by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), moved Biden's date for a renewable energy economy up by 15 years. The Trump campaign, meanwhile, accuses Biden of wanting to \u201cban fossil fuel energy\u201d entirely, based on a garbled Biden comment about ending fossil fuel subsidies.ADWhile they criticized the \u201csocialism\u201d of the task force plan, conservatives did not spend much time picking through it. \u201cNow we know what he meant when he said to transform America,\u201d Fox News host Sean Hannity told viewers Wednesday night, referring to use of the word \u201ctransform\u201d in a Biden tweet last week. After arguing that Democrats would seize \u201cthe means of production,\u201d and after mocking a short clip of Biden tangled up in a sentence, Hannity focused instead on comments by Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, then brought on the president's first son to discuss whether \u201cJoe Biden knows where he is,\u201d moving past the details of what he would run on.Biden has shown a willingness to embrace many of the left's priorities. It's unclear what parts of that his opponents will choose to notice.Reading list\u201cLiberals want more from Biden than an anti-Trump message,\u201d by Sean SullivanADADThe ongoing demands from the base to their nominee.\u201cA time to bail,\u201d by Mickey KausA Trump-backing Democrat's worries about 2020.\u201cDespite risks, Trump invests big in attacks on Biden\u2019s age,\u201d by Steve PeoplesThe pros and (so far mostly) cons of the \u201cis he losing it?\u201d campaign.\u201cTrump who?

It could happen.Dems in disarrayIt has been 16 days since New York's primaries, the first held under pandemic rules that made absentee voting easier. And as Thursday began, the candidates in New York City's five boroughs were still waiting to find out the results of that vote.AD\u201cIt's ridiculous,\u201d said Suraj Patel, a challenger to Rep. Carolyn B. Maloney who used another, unprintable word to describe what it's been like not to know the result in one of the primary's closest races.So, what happened? Initially, and according to the law, New York City was going to start counting ballots a week after the primary. That was delayed for a not particularly surprising reason: Lots of people cast ballots. An estimated 379,614 Democratic voters returned absentee ballots, blowing past the record and tripling the absentee ballots cast in 2016, when the presidential race was more competitive \u2014 and before a change in voter registration laws that made it easier for New Yorkers to vote in party primaries.ADThe result: We may not know many results in New York until this weekend and may not know full results until August. Only decisive races outside the city, such as the big GOP victory in a special election for a western New York congressional seat, or races with clear landslides, such as Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's primary win, have been called.\u00a0ADSome Democrats who seem to be winning their congressional races, like Ritchie Torres and Jamaal Bowman, are stuck in limbo. And earlier this week, Rep. Eliot L. Engel, who has not conceded defeat to Bowman, filed a lawsuit asking for a \u201cmanual count of all paper ballots,\u201d raising questions about whether some votes cast for Bowman may have been illegitimate. While Bowman ended Election Day up by 10,000 votes, nearly 40,000 absentee ballots are left to count.\u201cThousands of voters who duly applied for their Absentee Ballots did not receive them in a timely manner that would have allowed them to cast their ballot in said primary election,\u201d Engel's attorneys wrote. \u201cUpon further information and belief, votes were also cast by absentee ballots by voters who also voted on the voting machines either during early voting or on June 23, 2020. The counting of such absentee ballots is not permitted and would constitute a voter improperly casting two ballots.\u201dBowman's campaign has decried the lawsuit, citing the \u201cclear, decisive lead\u201d of Election Day. \u201cJamaal is ready to represent the people of New York's 16th District \u2014 in fact, he has already been using this time to work with the community,\u201d Bowman's campaign manager Luke Hayes said in a statement. \u201cBut, because of this lawsuit, that important work is being put on hold so Jamaal can work with our legal team to make sure everything is squared away.\u201dStill, New York's primary, coming weeks after Pennsylvania's troubled primary, has exposed the problems big states are facing in transitioning to a pandemic-ready system. States that have replaced in-person voting with absentee voting have systems set up for voters to learn when and why their ballots have been rejected, for reasons that can vary from weather damage to a sloppy signature. New York doesn't have such a process, and the Democratic-run state has just a few weeks to decide whether to create one, adding another layer (albeit a protective one) to the convoluted election system.The votes from Tuesday's primary in New Jersey, which was not as beset by problems as New York's, are also being counted. There was one significant upset, as first-time candidate Amy Kennedy rolled past Brigid Callahan Harrison, a major defeat for the south Jersey Democratic machine. While at least 42 percent of precincts remained uncounted as of Thursday afternoon, Kennedy had 62 percent of the vote in a multicandidate race, and Harrison had conceded. Kennedy will face Rep. Jeff Van Drew, a former Democrat who switched to the GOP and easily won his own primary.Delaware's presidential primary wrapped up quickly, with just three of 435 precincts outstanding after Election Day. Joe Biden, who represented the state in the Senate for 36 years, won 89 percent of the vote on a relatively high turnout. With most ballots counted, 90,976 Democrats had taken part in what, by this week, was a beauty contest; Biden will take all 21 available delegates. That was close to the 93,630 votes cast in 2016, when the race between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders remained competitive, and not far off the 96,374 votes cast in 2008, when the contest between Clinton and Barack Obama took place on Super Tuesday.Republican turnout was lower. Just 32,589 votes were counted after 99 percent of precincts reported. The president had 28,689 of those votes, with the rest going to California businessman Roque de la Fuente, who has made a hobby out of appearing on ballots. That was a decline of more than 50 percent since 2016, when 69,892 Republicans voted in a primary that three candidates, including Trump, were still competing in, and it was far off the 2008 result, when 50,239 Republicans turned out and most voted for John McCain.Ad watchNRSC, \u201cDeath Tax.\u201d National Republicans have worked quickly to define Theresa Greenfield, a Democrat who has never held office, and tarnish her preferred image as a farmer who became a small-business owner.

While the ad focuses on Suber's racist social media comments, it does not mention that Kobach cut ties after those comments were aired publicly. \n  \n  \n  You are reading The Trailer, the newsletter that brings the campaign trail to your inbox.  \n   \n   \n    \n   \n   \n  \n \nPoll watchHow do you interpret the slogan \u201cdefund the police?\u201d (Monmouth, 867 adults)Get rid of police: 18%Change the way police operate: 77%It has been one month since \u201cDefund the Police\u201d was painted by Washington, D.C., activists, next to the city-approved street art that read \u201cBlack Lives Matter.\u201d It's been a few weeks since the Trump campaign began running TV ads that portray a dark future in which a defunded police department, consisting of a voice mail and not much else, tells a caller to dial a number for the crime being committed and wait five days. But this is the first question asking voters to define \u201cdefunding\u201d and finds that the least popular iteration of the idea \u2014 literally ending policing \u2014 is not the way most voters view it. Just 27 percent of self-described conservatives think activists want to \u201cget rid of police,\u201d as do just 16 percent of white voters with college degrees. If that holds, it's a serious blow to the Trump campaign's theory that suburban voters can be turned back from Biden if they believe that he will abolish police departments, a position he does not hold.Candidate trackerThe biggest news affecting President Trump this week was largely out of his control: the Supreme Court's 7-to-2 decision allowing Manhattan District Attorney Cy Vance to subpoena the president's tax returns.\u201cA 3 year, $45,000,000 Mueller HOAX, failed,\u201d Trump tweeted after the decision came down. \u201cInvestigated everything\u2026 won all against the Federal Government and the Democrats send everything to politically corrupt New York, which is falling apart with everyone leaving, to give it a second, third and fourth try. Now the Supreme Court gives a delay ruling that they would never have given for another President. This is about PROSECUTORIAL MISCONDUCT.\u201dThe repercussions from that case, and a separate case led by House Democrats, are complicated; The Post's Robert Barnes has the details. But while it's unlikely that the president's tax documents will be resolved before November, the court has rekindled interest in one of the president's least popular positions. Polling has consistently found that less than 40 percent of voters believe Trump should conceal his tax returns.\u00a0In 2016, Trump repeatedly said he would release the returns at some point before the election. While he never did so, it was a prima facie admission of a political problem: Voters were uncomfortable with secrecy around a candidate's finances. Trump was able to fight voter concerns such as \u201chonesty\u201d and \u201ccorruption\u201d to a draw with Hillary Clinton, raising questions about donations to her family's foundation and demanding transparency about paid speeches she gave. (In the end, a hack of John Podesta's email would make those speeches public and give Trump something to work with.)\u00a0Joe Biden, who holds a large lead over Trump on the \u201chonesty\u201d question, is less exposed. He responded to the decision with a link to a 2019 video he made asking Trump to release the returns, then otherwise remained focused on the rollout of his economic plan.The court's decision dominated the president's other moves this week, though there is still speculation over whether one of the two conservatives justices who ruled in his favor, Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas, will retire before the election. On Wednesday, the president focused on the passage of the USMCA trade deal, welcoming Mexican President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador to the White House for the sort of event that might get lost in the news cycle but live on in campaign advertising.\u201cIn the United States, the extraordinary contributions of Mexican Americans are felt in every industry, every community, and every facet of our nation,\u201d the president said from the Oval Office. \u201cFrom art, to commerce, to science, to medicine, the Mexican people are incredible.\u00a0They upheld our highest values: God, family, and country.\u00a0They launch small businesses, propel industries, and they serve heroically in police departments and in our great military.\u201d\u00a0The Inevitable Kanye West ExplainerAs of this moment, five days after Kanye West tweeted that he was \u201crunning for president,\u201d Kanye West is not running for president. He has filed no paperwork with the Federal Election Commission. And his sole interview about the \u201ccampaign,\u201d with Forbes editor Randall Lane, did not offer many clues to a possible governing agenda.\u201cI don\u2019t know if I would use the word \u2018policy\u2019 for the way I would approach things,\u201d West explained. \u201cI don\u2019t have a policy when I went to Nike and designed Yeezy and went to Louis and designed a Louis Vuitton at the same time.\u201dWest's quasi-declaration may be a stunt, and West himself, according to the last poll taken since he announced his support of President Trump, is more popular with Republicans than Democrats. Still, the rumination of a Grammy-winning hip-hop artist is as good a reason as any to explain how bizarre presidential ballot access laws are now and how the coronavirus pandemic has, perhaps surprisingly, made them easier to follow.The rules governing third-party and independent candidates vary wildly from state to state. It is already too late for West, or any other independent, to petition for ballot access in five states: Indiana, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Carolina and Texas. Before the pandemic, that was a longer list. Several big states, like Colorado and Illinois, have delayed their deadlines or lowered the signature requirements for access. And confusing laws like Nevada's (the deadline is in August, but petitions need to start circulating tomorrow) and New Hampshire's (the deadline passed June 12) are being attacked in court.West would need only to do what he's already doing \u2014 nothing \u2014 for some ballot access laws to get relaxed. According to Richard Winger, the editor of the indispensable Ballot Access News, there are ongoing cases, brought by current third-party candidates, that could relax rules from Alaska to California to Georgia. In the District of Columbia, independent presidential candidates must file 5,000 signatures, while independents seeking other offices need to file only 250, language that seems ripe for a challenge.\u201cThere's an awful lot of lawsuits,\u201d Winger said, \u201cand we're not done with them.\u201dWest, who told Forbes that he would create a new Birthday Party if he ran for president, could still try to access ballots in states that offer a total of 467 electoral votes. In three states \u2014 Colorado, Louisiana and Oklahoma \u2014 he could make the ballot by paying filing fees, totaling $36,500. In Nevada, he'd have to start getting signatures tomorrow. But the clock doesn't run out for independent candidates to file until Sept. 4, when the filing period closes in Arizona, Kentucky, Mississippi and Rhode Island. (There'd be fewer options for West if he insisted on running with a Birthday Party, and not, in some states, as an independent; in Alabama, California, Kansas, South Carolina and West's adopted state of Wyoming, the deadline for new political parties has passed.)Under current laws, which could be changed by judges, getting a new candidate on these ballots would require a certain number of signatures to be gathered, then submitted, then found to be valid by the states \u2014 with the exception of Vermont, which waived its signature requirement. Getting on Tennessee's ballot takes just 275 valid signatures, while getting onto Florida's takes 132,781. The rest of the states that haven't locked down their ballot lines yet have requirements somewhere between those numbers, and some, such as New Jersey, have begun to allow electronic signatures in lieu of pandemic-unfriendly in-person signatures.All of that is doable, though it will get harder every day. West told Forbes that he would take 30 days to decide on a run. If the clock started with West's July 4 tweet, the decision would need to come by Aug. 3. By then, under current state laws, ballot access will have closed in Arkansas, Illinois, Kansas, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, Nebraska, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Vermont, Washington and West Virginia. A new candidate could still, in theory, get on enough ballots to be eligible for 272 electoral votes. But a candidate who declared Aug. 3 would have just 24 hours to get 2,000 valid signatures and make the ballot in Wisconsin.\u00a0None of it matters if this is, as speculated, a stunt. West would not have to file any paperwork with the FEC until he collected at least $5,000 for a campaign. The same day that he tweeted about his 2020 ambitions, a former child star turned bitcoin influencer named Brock Pierce actually announced a campaign and began exploring ballot access options.\u201cHe's really taking it seriously,\u201d Winger said of Pierce. \u201cYou should write about him instead of Kanye West.\u201d\u00a0Countdown\u2026 two days until the Louisiana primary\u2026 three days until the Puerto Rico primary\u2026 five days until runoffs in Alabama and Texas and the primary in Maine\u2026 39 days until the Democratic National Convention\u2026 49 days until the Republican National Convention\u2026 57 days until some absentee ballots start going out\u2026 117 days until the general election", "comment": "452 Comments", "topic": "Politics"}, {"cover": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/OUYSZJGCF4I6VCIINCRLT2XJ4A.jpghttps://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/OUYSZJGCF4I6VCIINCRLT2XJ4A.jpg", "title": "Joe Biden has shifted left", "date": "Jul 9, 2020", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/joe-biden-has-shifted-left/2020/07/09/bd0b4e11-4aa5-4eaa-b16e-2b91d3a3abec_story.html", "keyword": "presidential election and trade war", "website": "the Washington Post", "author": "David Weigel", "content": "In this edition: What the left got out of the Biden-Sanders task force, why votes still aren't counted in New York, and why, yes, a certain rapper still has time to run for president, if he's not joking.Support our journalism. Subscribe today.arrow-rightNo, the Supreme Court didn't abolish Oklahoma today, and this is The Trailer.The last time Joe Biden appeared on a presidential ticket, the Democratic Party's platform contained no mention of marijuana. Its health-care language focused on the Affordable Care Act, suggesting that the fight for universal coverage was pretty much won. It promised to \u201cfight inequalities in our criminal justice system,\u201d without spelling out how, and urged that when the death penalty is used, it should \u201cnot be arbitrary.\u201dADBiden is happily inheriting a party that has moved to the left, without interruption, since he left the vice presidency. The report this week from his Unity Task Force, the product of a deal between the nominee and primary runner-up Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), found Biden's team inching a little further in that direction \u2014 cautious, careful with its wording, but dramatically different from the politics that defined much of Biden's career.AD\u201cI think the compromise that they came up with, if implemented, will make Biden the most progressive president since FDR,\u201d Sanders said in a Wednesday night interview with MSNBC's Chris Hayes.\u00a0Republicans quickly repurposed Sanders's answer to describe Biden as a catspaw for the country's resurgent socialist movements. \u201cThis is surrendering to the\u00a0socialists,\u201d House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) said in a Thursday interview on Fox News. The Republican National Committee highlighted sentences taken directly from some of Sanders's campaign white papers to accuse Biden of \u201cplagiarism,\u201d a charge that evoked his botched 1988 presidential campaign, if not quite describing a task force designed to merge platforms.ADBut the basic Republican critique was right. Biden, seen by voters as the most moderate of their two dozen or so options in the primary, has welcomed a shift away from the careful politics Democrats deployed, for decades, to mollify suburban voters. Under his proposals, millions of voters are offered a new government health-care plan, and millions more are offered federal housing and housing assistance. Tax cuts, emphasized for years to convince swing voters, aren't prioritized.AD\u201cIn 2008, one of the things we had to constantly fight in places like the I-4 corridor was taxes,\u201d said Steve Schale, an Obama-Biden campaign veteran who's now a strategist for the pro-Biden super PAC Unite the Country, referring to a vote-rich stretch of Florida cities and suburbs. \u201cI bet you we ran more ads about Barack Obama cutting middle-class taxes than anything. We had to win that fight. Our ad strategy was built around keeping that fight neutral.\u201dTough-on-crime politicking has been de-emphasized, too. The party's 2012 platform did not mention the \u201cwar on drugs.\u201d The 2016 platform, reshaped by Sanders delegates, condemned the drug war for the \u201cimprisonment of millions of Americans, disproportionately people of color.\u201d The task force's paper, with Biden's name at the top, pledges to \u201cend the failed \u2018War on Drugs\u2019 \u201d entirely.ADThat's still less than Sanders and his allies wanted, and skepticism of the task force, from the beginning, assumed that Biden would invite the left inside his tent to make it less relevant but not deliver. The task force does not recommend a right to strike for public workers, a right that the left wants but that is not favored by leadership of the biggest public-sector union. It recommends the legalization of medical marijuana but not the full legalization now favored by most voters. And criminal justice reform advocates noticed that the task force recommended only that qualified immunity, which protects police from lawsuits, be \u201creined in,\u201d not ended.\u00a0ADEven so, that's more than Biden needed to offer to the left and Sanders supporters, and more than most defeated candidates have gotten. While Sanders won just 29 percent of pledged delegates throughout the primaries, he appointed 40 percent of the task force, giving him more influence on a high-profile set of recommendations that will shape the party's platform than he was going to get on the platform itself. While Sanders's path was vanishing by early April, his decision to drop out gave Biden three months as the de facto nominee, instead of the drawn-out contest feared by Democrats. And polling by the New York Times and Siena has found just a handful of Sanders supporters, and no Warren supporters, frustrated enough by the primary to consider backing President Trump.Sanders's interest in the platform of a party he does not belong to has been one of the senator's great contradictions. In primary mode, he has excoriated the party's \u201cestablishment.\u201d When the 2016 and 2020 primaries were over, he focused intensely on changing the party's official positioning, even though nothing binds a party to govern on its platform.ADThe secrecy of the task forces prevented the sort of messy, televised fight that Democrats went through in 2016, when Sanders supporters in an Orlando hotel ballroom shouted \u201cshame!\u201d if a Sanders plank was voted down. It has given the left a tool to use in whatever form these platform discussions take.\u00a0ADWhile Medicare-for-all proponents made up a majority of the health-care task force, they did not try to put Biden on record for a policy he famously considers unworkable. They did successfully urge a major revision to his health-care plan, calling for poor people not eligible for Medicaid to be \u201cautomatically enrolled\u201d in a public health-care option \u2014 a change from Biden's proposal that new enrollees join through interactions with other government programs.None of this made it into Biden's Thursday economic speech near Scranton, Pa., the centerpiece of a days-long policy rollout that was delayed by a month of civil rights protests. That speech emphasized a \u201cbuy American\u201d proposal adopted in part from Elizabeth Warren's (D-Mass.) campaign, to the consternation of some Trump allies, who wanted the president to move first on a similar policy.ADBut the Republican response to the task force didn't spend much time on the details, either. It has become a frequent feature of this campaign: The Trump campaign incorrectly assigned a far-left position to Biden, making a position that he holds, one that's merely much further left than the Obama-Biden platform, sound more moderate. The task force's climate plan, shaped in part by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), moved Biden's date for a renewable energy economy up by 15 years. The Trump campaign, meanwhile, accuses Biden of wanting to \u201cban fossil fuel energy\u201d entirely, based on a garbled Biden comment about ending fossil fuel subsidies.ADWhile they criticized the \u201csocialism\u201d of the task force plan, conservatives did not spend much time picking through it. \u201cNow we know what he meant when he said to transform America,\u201d Fox News host Sean Hannity told viewers Wednesday night, referring to use of the word \u201ctransform\u201d in a Biden tweet last week. After arguing that Democrats would seize \u201cthe means of production,\u201d and after mocking a short clip of Biden tangled up in a sentence, Hannity focused instead on comments by Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, then brought on the president's first son to discuss whether \u201cJoe Biden knows where he is,\u201d moving past the details of what he would run on.Biden has shown a willingness to embrace many of the left's priorities. It's unclear what parts of that his opponents will choose to notice.Reading list\u201cLiberals want more from Biden than an anti-Trump message,\u201d by Sean SullivanADADThe ongoing demands from the base to their nominee.\u201cA time to bail,\u201d by Mickey KausA Trump-backing Democrat's worries about 2020.\u201cDespite risks, Trump invests big in attacks on Biden\u2019s age,\u201d by Steve PeoplesThe pros and (so far mostly) cons of the \u201cis he losing it?\u201d campaign.\u201cTrump who?

It could happen.Dems in disarrayIt has been 16 days since New York's primaries, the first held under pandemic rules that made absentee voting easier. And as Thursday began, the candidates in New York City's five boroughs were still waiting to find out the results of that vote.AD\u201cIt's ridiculous,\u201d said Suraj Patel, a challenger to Rep. Carolyn B. Maloney who used another, unprintable word to describe what it's been like not to know the result in one of the primary's closest races.So, what happened? Initially, and according to the law, New York City was going to start counting ballots a week after the primary. That was delayed for a not particularly surprising reason: Lots of people cast ballots. An estimated 379,614 Democratic voters returned absentee ballots, blowing past the record and tripling the absentee ballots cast in 2016, when the presidential race was more competitive \u2014 and before a change in voter registration laws that made it easier for New Yorkers to vote in party primaries.ADThe result: We may not know many results in New York until this weekend and may not know full results until August. Only decisive races outside the city, such as the big GOP victory in a special election for a western New York congressional seat, or races with clear landslides, such as Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's primary win, have been called.\u00a0ADSome Democrats who seem to be winning their congressional races, like Ritchie Torres and Jamaal Bowman, are stuck in limbo. And earlier this week, Rep. Eliot L. Engel, who has not conceded defeat to Bowman, filed a lawsuit asking for a \u201cmanual count of all paper ballots,\u201d raising questions about whether some votes cast for Bowman may have been illegitimate. While Bowman ended Election Day up by 10,000 votes, nearly 40,000 absentee ballots are left to count.\u201cThousands of voters who duly applied for their Absentee Ballots did not receive them in a timely manner that would have allowed them to cast their ballot in said primary election,\u201d Engel's attorneys wrote. \u201cUpon further information and belief, votes were also cast by absentee ballots by voters who also voted on the voting machines either during early voting or on June 23, 2020. The counting of such absentee ballots is not permitted and would constitute a voter improperly casting two ballots.\u201dBowman's campaign has decried the lawsuit, citing the \u201cclear, decisive lead\u201d of Election Day. \u201cJamaal is ready to represent the people of New York's 16th District \u2014 in fact, he has already been using this time to work with the community,\u201d Bowman's campaign manager Luke Hayes said in a statement. \u201cBut, because of this lawsuit, that important work is being put on hold so Jamaal can work with our legal team to make sure everything is squared away.\u201dStill, New York's primary, coming weeks after Pennsylvania's troubled primary, has exposed the problems big states are facing in transitioning to a pandemic-ready system. States that have replaced in-person voting with absentee voting have systems set up for voters to learn when and why their ballots have been rejected, for reasons that can vary from weather damage to a sloppy signature. New York doesn't have such a process, and the Democratic-run state has just a few weeks to decide whether to create one, adding another layer (albeit a protective one) to the convoluted election system.The votes from Tuesday's primary in New Jersey, which was not as beset by problems as New York's, are also being counted. There was one significant upset, as first-time candidate Amy Kennedy rolled past Brigid Callahan Harrison, a major defeat for the south Jersey Democratic machine. While at least 42 percent of precincts remained uncounted as of Thursday afternoon, Kennedy had 62 percent of the vote in a multicandidate race, and Harrison had conceded. Kennedy will face Rep. Jeff Van Drew, a former Democrat who switched to the GOP and easily won his own primary.Delaware's presidential primary wrapped up quickly, with just three of 435 precincts outstanding after Election Day. Joe Biden, who represented the state in the Senate for 36 years, won 89 percent of the vote on a relatively high turnout. With most ballots counted, 90,976 Democrats had taken part in what, by this week, was a beauty contest; Biden will take all 21 available delegates. That was close to the 93,630 votes cast in 2016, when the race between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders remained competitive, and not far off the 96,374 votes cast in 2008, when the contest between Clinton and Barack Obama took place on Super Tuesday.Republican turnout was lower. Just 32,589 votes were counted after 99 percent of precincts reported. The president had 28,689 of those votes, with the rest going to California businessman Roque de la Fuente, who has made a hobby out of appearing on ballots. That was a decline of more than 50 percent since 2016, when 69,892 Republicans voted in a primary that three candidates, including Trump, were still competing in, and it was far off the 2008 result, when 50,239 Republicans turned out and most voted for John McCain.Ad watchNRSC, \u201cDeath Tax.\u201d National Republicans have worked quickly to define Theresa Greenfield, a Democrat who has never held office, and tarnish her preferred image as a farmer who became a small-business owner.

He responded to the decision with a link to a 2019 video he made asking Trump to release the returns, then otherwise remained focused on the rollout of his economic plan.The court's decision dominated the president's other moves this week, though there is still speculation over whether one of the two conservatives justices who ruled in his favor, Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas, will retire before the election. On Wednesday, the president focused on the passage of the USMCA trade deal, welcoming Mexican President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador to the White House for the sort of event that might get lost in the news cycle but live on in campaign advertising.\u201cIn the United States, the extraordinary contributions of Mexican Americans are felt in every industry, every community, and every facet of our nation,\u201d the president said from the Oval Office. \u201cFrom art, to commerce, to science, to medicine, the Mexican people are incredible.\u00a0They upheld our highest values: God, family, and country.\u00a0They launch small businesses, propel industries, and they serve heroically in police departments and in our great military.\u201d\u00a0The Inevitable Kanye West ExplainerAs of this moment, five days after Kanye West tweeted that he was \u201crunning for president,\u201d Kanye West is not running for president. He has filed no paperwork with the Federal Election Commission. And his sole interview about the \u201ccampaign,\u201d with Forbes editor Randall Lane, did not offer many clues to a possible governing agenda.\u201cI don\u2019t know if I would use the word \u2018policy\u2019 for the way I would approach things,\u201d West explained. \u201cI don\u2019t have a policy when I went to Nike and designed Yeezy and went to Louis and designed a Louis Vuitton at the same time.\u201dWest's quasi-declaration may be a stunt, and West himself, according to the last poll taken since he announced his support of President Trump, is more popular with Republicans than Democrats. Still, the rumination of a Grammy-winning hip-hop artist is as good a reason as any to explain how bizarre presidential ballot access laws are now and how the coronavirus pandemic has, perhaps surprisingly, made them easier to follow.The rules governing third-party and independent candidates vary wildly from state to state. It is already too late for West, or any other independent, to petition for ballot access in five states: Indiana, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Carolina and Texas. Before the pandemic, that was a longer list. Several big states, like Colorado and Illinois, have delayed their deadlines or lowered the signature requirements for access. And confusing laws like Nevada's (the deadline is in August, but petitions need to start circulating tomorrow) and New Hampshire's (the deadline passed June 12) are being attacked in court.West would need only to do what he's already doing \u2014 nothing \u2014 for some ballot access laws to get relaxed. According to Richard Winger, the editor of the indispensable Ballot Access News, there are ongoing cases, brought by current third-party candidates, that could relax rules from Alaska to California to Georgia. In the District of Columbia, independent presidential candidates must file 5,000 signatures, while independents seeking other offices need to file only 250, language that seems ripe for a challenge.\u201cThere's an awful lot of lawsuits,\u201d Winger said, \u201cand we're not done with them.\u201dWest, who told Forbes that he would create a new Birthday Party if he ran for president, could still try to access ballots in states that offer a total of 467 electoral votes. In three states \u2014 Colorado, Louisiana and Oklahoma \u2014 he could make the ballot by paying filing fees, totaling $36,500. In Nevada, he'd have to start getting signatures tomorrow. But the clock doesn't run out for independent candidates to file until Sept. 4, when the filing period closes in Arizona, Kentucky, Mississippi and Rhode Island. (There'd be fewer options for West if he insisted on running with a Birthday Party, and not, in some states, as an independent; in Alabama, California, Kansas, South Carolina and West's adopted state of Wyoming, the deadline for new political parties has passed.)Under current laws, which could be changed by judges, getting a new candidate on these ballots would require a certain number of signatures to be gathered, then submitted, then found to be valid by the states \u2014 with the exception of Vermont, which waived its signature requirement. Getting on Tennessee's ballot takes just 275 valid signatures, while getting onto Florida's takes 132,781. The rest of the states that haven't locked down their ballot lines yet have requirements somewhere between those numbers, and some, such as New Jersey, have begun to allow electronic signatures in lieu of pandemic-unfriendly in-person signatures.All of that is doable, though it will get harder every day. West told Forbes that he would take 30 days to decide on a run. If the clock started with West's July 4 tweet, the decision would need to come by Aug. 3. By then, under current state laws, ballot access will have closed in Arkansas, Illinois, Kansas, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, Nebraska, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Vermont, Washington and West Virginia. A new candidate could still, in theory, get on enough ballots to be eligible for 272 electoral votes. But a candidate who declared Aug. 3 would have just 24 hours to get 2,000 valid signatures and make the ballot in Wisconsin.\u00a0None of it matters if this is, as speculated, a stunt. West would not have to file any paperwork with the FEC until he collected at least $5,000 for a campaign. The same day that he tweeted about his 2020 ambitions, a former child star turned bitcoin influencer named Brock Pierce actually announced a campaign and began exploring ballot access options.\u201cHe's really taking it seriously,\u201d Winger said of Pierce. \u201cYou should write about him instead of Kanye West.\u201d\u00a0Countdown\u2026 two days until the Louisiana primary\u2026 three days until the Puerto Rico primary\u2026 five days until runoffs in Alabama and Texas and the primary in Maine\u2026 39 days until the Democratic National Convention\u2026 49 days until the Republican National Convention\u2026 57 days until some absentee ballots start going out\u2026 117 days until the general election", "comment": "452 Comments", "topic": "Politics"}, {"cover": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/DAU4VQBLBAI6VP76AIGIRM7REA.jpghttps://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/DAU4VQBLBAI6VP76AIGIRM7REA.jpg", "title": "Never Trumpers are Democrats in Republican clothing", "date": "Jul 13, 2020", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/07/13/never-trumpers-are-democrats-republican-clothing/", "keyword": "presidential election and trade war", "website": "the Washington Post", "author": "Henry Olsen", "content": "The Lincoln Project has quickly established itself as the political arm of the \u201cNever Trump\u201d Republicans.

Subscribe today.arrow-rightThe year\u2019s Senate races offer a fresh indication of their real motives. The project\u2019s newest television ad names 15 Republican senators whom voters should oppose, including 13 up for reelection. Their sin? Backing Trump on matters such as impeachment. The fact that nearly all Republican voters both approve of Trump\u2019s job performance and opposed impeachment doesn\u2019t seem to matter to those who claim to represent true Republican values.Nor does what these senators vote for in the Senate seem to matter, either. These men and women have voted to confirm hundreds of conservative judges, once known as a core Republican value. They voted for a standard Republican supply-side tax cut, another core GOP belief. Apparently voting for Republican ideas and backing a Republican president no longer qualifies one as a good Republican in the Lincoln Project\u2019s eyes.Sign up for The Odds newsletter for election updates from data columnist David BylerJohn Weaver, a veteran campaign strategist for moderate Republicans, made the project\u2019s true aims even clearer this weekend. In a Post article, Weaver said, \u201cOur task won\u2019t be finished when Joe Biden takes the oath of office.\u201d He said the project would seek to derail Sens. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) and others of their \u201cilk\u201d from getting the next GOP presidential nomination. The only thing these men are guilty of is questioning the pre-Trump Republican economic orthodoxy on matters such as trade, regulation of the Internet and immigration. Apparently that\u2019s also beyond the pale for a group that bears the name of a president who believed in a protective tariff all of his career.ADADThe Lincoln Project is thus a U.S. version of a phenomenon seen worldwide: centrist conservatives who no longer feel at home in a party whose voters want a more nationalist and populist agenda. This was seen in Britain in the Brexit debate, where many important party figures broke ranks to oppose Brexit and urged Conservative voters to oppose the Conservative Party in last year\u2019s election. A milder version appeared in Australia in 2018, when urban centrist Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull was ousted by his party caucus for not being sufficiently mindful of conservative values on the economy and climate change. Many centrist, educated voters abandoned Turnbull\u2019s Liberal Party in the 2019 election in favor of the center-left Labor Party or centrist independents.But what Weaver and his buddies don\u2019t seem to understand is that they, like their Anglosphere counterparts, are a small minority within the center-right electorate. The Tories who rebelled from their party lost badly in 2019 to Brexit-backing Boris Johnson, who attracted voters in blue-collar, historically Labour seats. Turnbull\u2019s successor, Prime Minister Scott Morrison, won despite trailing in nearly every pre-election poll by offsetting the flight of some educated conservatives with blue-collar, former Labor voters in small-town and rural Australia.Weaver himself has tried to move the party to the center in the past two presidential campaigns, as chief strategist for former Utah governor Jon Huntsman in 2012 and then-Ohio Gov. John Kasich in 2016. Each did well among educated moderates but crashed and burned among the 70 percent of Republican voters who are conservatives. Never Trump thus reveals its real names: Never Learn and Never Listen.ADADIndeed, the Lincoln Project itself is misnamed. It should be called the Doughface Project. \u201cDoughface\u201d was a pejorative term applied to Northern Democrats who supported Southern stances on the question of slavery in the territories before the Civil War, such as Lincoln\u2019s strongest opponent, Sen. Stephen Douglas (D-Ill.). The Lincoln Project\u2019s leaders clearly align with Democratic values on questions such as trade, immigration and the Internet, and are willing to, at best, overlook Democratic values on matters such as taxes, climate change and religious liberty. Democratic principles in Republican clothing: That\u2019s a modern doughface in a nutshell.The Lincoln Project has no future if its objective is to remake the post-Trump Republican Party in its image. Republican voters didn\u2019t want what they were selling before Trump, and they certainly won\u2019t want it afterward. Worldwide, center-right voters are seeking populist-tinged conservatism, and so the initiative\u2019s only effective purpose will be to elect Democrats this fall and in the future. There\u2019s a name for people who want to do that: Democrats.Read more:Henry Olsen: This year\u2019s Senate races spell disaster for the Republican PartyPaul Waldman: The Never Trumpers might finally be on to somethingJennifer Rubin: NeverTrump becomes NeverRepublicanJennifer Rubin: Understanding the mysterious group of Never TrumpersMax Boot: Conservatives have a \u2018cancel culture\u2019 of their own", "comment": "3.6k Comments", "topic": "Opinions"}, {"cover": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/TZ4KCRV7PAI6VCIINCRLT2XJ4A.jpghttps://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/TZ4KCRV7PAI6VCIINCRLT2XJ4A.jpg", "title": "The Trailer: Who's afraid of Joe Biden?", "date": "Jul 7, 2020", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/paloma/the-trailer/2020/07/07/the-trailer-who-s-afraid-of-joe-biden/5f00a17d602ff1080719519b/", "keyword": "presidential election and trade war", "website": "the Washington Post", "author": "David Weigel", "content": "In this edition: Why nobody's afraid of Joe Biden, what's happening in today's Delaware and New Jersey primaries, and how Mount Rushmore entered the veepstakes.Welcome to the only thrice-weekly campaign newsletter that did not take a PPP grant.

Martha McSally's ads\u00a0warn\u00a0that Joe Biden \u201cvoted to send our jobs to China\u201d and would create \u201cgovernment-controlled health insurance.\u201d In Montana, an ad for Republican Sen. Steve Daines warns that Gov. Steve Bullock, his opponent in November, would \u201chelp Biden and Pelosi pass government-controlled health care\u201d if he joined the Senate.\u00a0And in Georgia and Oklahoma, ads run during last month\u2019s primaries tied Biden to antifa and attacked Carly Fiorina for endorsing him.ADThese commercials, which run a total of three minutes, represent something rare this year: attacks by down-ballot candidates on Democratic nominee for president. According to Ad Analytics, which tracks TV buys, no other commercials by Republican candidates for House or Senate have bothered with Biden, focusing more frequently on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) or Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York.ADFour months after Super Tuesday, four months before the general election, Biden has not become the focus of Republican or conservative attacks at the level of recent Democratic nominees. That\u2019s not for a lack of trying by President Trump\u2019s campaign, which has spent tens of millions of dollars attacking Biden. But the early summer period that\u2019s typically used to define a presidential challenger has left Biden largely undamaged, with Democrats down the ballot happily associating themselves with him.\u201cHillary Clinton had 30 years of hard negatives against her, and Nancy Pelosi was a leader on liberal issues like Obamacare,\u201d said Matt Gorman, a Republican strategist whose stints at the National Republican Congressional Committee produced countless attacks on Pelosi. \u201cThey were in the spotlight in a way that a vice president operating in Barack Obama\u2019s shadow just wasn\u2019t. And Biden has been adept at not always taking the bait on stuff like \u2018defund the police\u2019 or the Green New Deal. He just doesn\u2019t come off as polarizing.\u201dADBiden\u2019s image, and the troubles that Republicans might have in muddying it, was one of the major arguments for his candidacy. That didn\u2019t always inspire Democratic primary voters. In the run-up to Iowa\u2019s caucuses, former Iowa first lady Christie Vilsack urged voters to \u201cthink about the people in the middle\u201d and pick Biden to appeal to them, even if they were more in agreement with another candidate.ADThat argument didn\u2019t sell in Iowa or New Hampshire, but it clicked in South Carolina and quickly got Biden the nomination. The months since then have been a study in Republican frustration, with Biden\u2019s personal favorable rating holding steady in the high 40s and no particular personal attack on Biden breaking through with focus groups.\u201cYou can try to paint him as a radical, but it\u2019s not going to work,\u201d Vilsack\u2019s husband, former agriculture secretary Tom Vilsack, said in an interview. \u201cThere may be a lot of reasons, both in terms of race and in terms of gender, that made Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton susceptible to that kind of stuff. Joe Biden is a white guy.\u201dADThat\u2019s one theory for why Biden, despite two previous runs for president, has simply not churned up much voter anger. No recent Democratic nominee has entered the summer of a presidential election without a clear effort to portray them as dangerous. By this point in 2016, the conservative publisher Regnery was selling eight books about Hillary Clinton; by this point in 2012, it was selling 13 books about Barack Obama.ADThe publisher is offering just one book about this year\u2019s nominee, the upcoming \u201cThe Biden Deception,\u201d\u00a0which asks whether Biden is a \u201ccrypto-socialist.\u201d That\u2019s it, and no other books critical of Biden, specifically, are being published right now. Dinesh D\u2019Souza, who produced election-year books and documentaries about both Obama and Clinton, is now selling \u201cThe United States of Socialism,\u201d in which Biden appears only a few times as a \u201csocialist lite,\u201d with more attention paid to the business dealings of Biden\u2019s son Hunter and brother Jimmy than to Biden\u2019s own record. Peter Schweizer, whose \u201cClinton Cash\u201d and related 2016 articles provided ammo for the Trump campaign, dealt briefly with Biden in a book about \u201cAmerica's progressive elite.\u201d\u00a0David Freddoso, a conservative journalist who published\u00a0\u201cThe Case Against Barack Obama\u201d\u00a0for Regnery in August 2008, watched it hit the New York Times bestseller list, then published two more takedowns of the 44th president. He doubted that there would be as much interest in a similar Biden book.AD\u201cThere was a real hunger for knowledge about Obama in 2008,\u201d Freddoso said. \u201cHe was intriguing and unknown. People perceived him as something different, and as someone with a future. Biden can't pretend to be any of those things. He's also running against an incumbent who is everyone's center of attention. If your goal is to generate interest and sell books, you're probably better off this time writing about Trump.\u201dADThere has been digging into Biden\u2019s record, but none of it has stirred conservative passions. The Republican National Committee briefly campaigned for the release of Biden\u2019s Senate papers, which are being held by the University of Delaware until after his career in \u201cpublic life\u201d is over. But it has not mentioned that issue since May 12, a night-and-day difference with the demands Clinton faced for her emails or that Obama faced for his birth and college records.\u00a0The conservative group Judicial Watch has sued for those papers and sued for Hunter Biden\u2019s business records, but neither effort has gotten much attention. In a recent, seven-minute segment with Judicial Watch\u2019s Tom Fitton, Fox Business host Lou Dobbs repeatedly pivoted to other stories, asking Fitton about the Supreme Court\u2019s electoral college ruling and the president\u2019s July 3 speech at Mount Rushmore.AD\u201cI want to take up the Biden issue, and I\u2019m talking about the Hunter Biden issue, with 10 percent ownership in that private equity, Chinese, private equity firm,\u201d Dobbs said. \u201cBut I want to get a sense, from you, as to the president taking on, for the first time, corporate America and its role in this left-wing fascism that is being bred in this country.\u201dADRepublican attacks on Biden have adjusted to the candidate's outrage-deficient image. In its own advertising, the Trump campaign portrays Biden as \u201cweak\u201d and \u201cdeclining,\u201d arguing that he would not truly be running the country if he won the election. In a Fourth of July tweet, sometime Trump adviser Newt Gingrich wrote that he was not \u201cafraid of Joe Biden\u201d but afraid of the Democrats his win would empower.\u00a0\u201cPrecisely because Biden is weak he would be dominated by Pelosi and Schumer,\u201d Gingrich wrote. In a column three days later, former New Hampshire senator Judd Gregg went further, arguing without evidence that \u201cthe socialist/progressive wing of the Democratic Party\u201d would engineer a \u201ccoup\u201d if Biden won, installing a new left-wing president that the country had never gotten to vet.AD\u201cWithin a few months of assuming the presidency, Biden may find himself being the next statue toppled as the socialist/progressive movement moves closer to power,\u201d Gregg wrote. \u201cReplacing him with his vice president could be deemed necessary to the cause.\u201dADAt the start of the year, Republicans hoped to be running against of those other Democrats. Ahead of the South Carolina primary, as Biden reeled, Republicans prepared to mourn him: a Democrat they could do business with, defeated by his party's radical left.\u201cI\u2019d say he\u2019s probably the most likely one to have a chance at beating Donald Trump,\u201d former House speaker Paul D. Ryan told CNBC in February. \u201cBut I don\u2019t see Joe getting the nomination, I just don\u2019t see him getting there. I think it\u2019s going be one of these progressives, which I think will be much easier to beat.\u201dADFive months later, the Democratic nominee has given Republicans little to work with, and even his critics inside the party are delighted. At his June 30 news conference in Wilmington, Biden distanced himself from protesters who've torn down, or called for the removal, of statues celebrating America's founders. In lieu of a gaffe, Republicans accused him of being too meek to condemn those protesters.AD\u201cDems support the riots. The vandals. The anarchists,\u201d Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas tweeted. \u201cThat\u2019s their base. And they\u2019re terrified to offend them.\u201dThat inspired a response from Ocasio-Cortez, who had endorsed Bernie Sanders for president, and once said that in another country, she and Biden would belong to different political parties.AD\u201cYes, that is precisely why the party nominated...

Yes, Joe Biden has secured enough delegates to win the nomination on the first ballot. Yes, his Democratic rivals have endorsed him. But three states and Puerto Rico, all of which had delayed their primaries due to the coronavirus pandemic, are finally picking delegates this week. And former Bernie Sanders campaign staffers are still encouraging supporters to back him and increase his clout at the DNC.Two of those states vote today, Delaware and New Jersey. (Louisiana votes this weekend.) In the former vice president's adopted home state, he's favored to win all 21 delegates, thanks both to his local strength and to the state's demographics.\u00a0Black voters regularly make up a third of the Democratic electorate in Delaware, and the state's biggest population center, New Castle County, contains the kind of suburbs that rallied behind Biden when the primary was still competitive. Combine that with Sanders's weakness in the Maryland counties that border rural Delaware, and Elizabeth Warren's presence on the ballot, and it may be a stretch for Sanders to hit the 15 percent of the vote needed to secure a delegate. The most interesting aspect of the election may be that Delaware used it to experiment with online, secured voting, though it halted that after concerns were raised by voters.There are 126 delegates at stake in New Jersey, the biggest prize still left on the calendar; like Delaware, it wasn't friendly territory for Sanders four years ago. (He won 37 percent of the vote there, compared with 39 percent in the First State.) Like Texas, New Jersey assigns some of its delegates statewide and the rest to winners in state legislative districts. Sanders won just one of those districts, in red and rural northwest New Jersey, four years ago, and he ran strongly around college campuses. Unlike Delawareans, New Jersey voters will have just two candidates on their ballots, but they'll have an \u201cuncommitted\u201d option, too, and the choice of a no-name protest vote has probably cost Sanders delegates in other states, such as Kentucky.Delaware won't hold the rest of its statewide elections until September, but New Jersey's congressional primaries will end tomorrow, and four of them are worth watching. The bitterest race is in the 2nd District, which Rep. Jeff Van Drew won as a Democrat two years ago, only to switch parties when polling found his vote against impeachment potentially costing him the seat in a primary. (Van Drew has since flipped on a multitude of issues, co-sponsoring statehood for D.C. before voting against it.) He faces an intraparty challenge from Bob Patterson, who ran in a different seat on the other side of the state four years ago and has spent only around $200,000 on this race.Five Democrats are fighting for the right to face Van Drew. The strongest fundraiser has been Amy Kennedy, the wife of former Rhode Island congressman Patrick Kennedy, making her first run for office. Local Democratic support had gone to Brigid Callahan Harrison, a Montclair State University political scientist; Kennedy has tried to jujitsu that against Harrison, portraying herself as an anti-machine candidate, even though her husband had tried to win south Jersey Democratic boss George Norcross over to her campaign. Will Cunningham, a former Hill staffer who ran unsuccessfully in the 2018 primary, has struggled to break through, with liberal groups such as the Working Families Party sticking with Kennedy, seeking to avoid the 2018 vote split that helped Van Drew win in the first place. Two other Democrats are on the ballot but have done little campaigning.Democrats flipped three other New Jersey House seats two years ago, all of them heading for very different November races. In the 3rd District, either venture capitalist David Richter or county politician Kate Gibbs will win the right to face Rep. Andy Kim. In the 7th District, state Sen. Tom Kean, the son of the state's most popular living Republican governor, is already one of the party's strongest recruits; he's expected to beat two gadfly candidates and face Rep. Tom Malinowski. (There are no primaries in the 11th District, where Rep. Mikie Sherrill already knows her GOP opponent, former Hill aide Rosemary Becchi.)The rest of Tuesday's contrast are Democratic family feuds, with left-wing candidates working to best incumbents who've outspent them and, in the past, rolled past opposition easily. In the 5th District, which moderate Rep. Josh Gottheimer is the first Democrat to represent, city councilor Arati Kreibich has run from the left, arguing that constituents can do better than a congressman who frequently votes against party leadership and with Republicans. But since getting organized after the 2016 election, insurgent Democrats have struggled to beat incumbents in swing seats; the 5th District has been moving toward the party but was carried by the president four years ago by a single point.The 8th District is one of the safest Democratic seats in New Jersey and a test for whether the kind of campaign that elected Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in New York can win across the river. Hector Oseguera is the first serious challenger to Rep. Albio Sires, who won the seat 14 years ago and has made few waves in Congress. Oseguera won an early victory when he secured the \u201cA\u201d line on the ballot, the first one voters see in the booth; the district's Democratic leaders countered that by making sure Joe Biden led the \u201cB\u201d line, the one Sires would appear under. While Oseguera has spent just $42,183 on the race, Sires, who does not face credible Republican challengers, spent and raised less than $400,000, a pittance in a safe seat. (New York Rep.

But it does a monthly check of the president's approval rating, and after finding a rise in the start of the year, it has found voters drifting away since the start of the coronavirus pandemic. The headlines focused on Trump's 38 percent approval rating \u2014 well below the number incumbent presidents have been elected with \u2014 but it's the withering of swing-vote support that tells the story. Just one demographic group, white voters without college degrees, supports the president with a clear majority. Meanwhile, while 48 percent of white voters with degrees backed Trump four years ago, per exit polling, just 33 percent of them approve of his performance now.Candidate trackerJoe Biden's do-no-harm campaigning continued through and past the holiday weekend, with no public events, some fundraising and the aforementioned video celebrating the Fourth of July.

Subscribe today.arrow-rightIn one of his most far-reaching plans since emerging as the presumptive Democratic nominee, Biden called for the federal government to spend $400 billion over four years on materials and services made in the United States, as well as $300 billion on U.S.-based research and development involving electric cars, artificial intelligence and similar technologies.He also advocated a 100-day \u201csupply chain review\u201d that could require federal agencies to buy only medical supplies and other goods manufactured in the United States. And he urged an end to loopholes that let procurement officers and federal contractors get around  existing \u201cBuy American\u201d clauses.ADAD\u201cWhen we spend taxpayers\u2019 money \u2014 when the federal government spends taxpayers\u2019 money \u2014 we should use it to buy American products and support American jobs,\u201d Biden said in a speech at a metal works plant in Dunmore in Pennsylvania, a crucial battleground state.The announcement marked an effort by Biden to begin laying out his agenda in more detail after months in which his central message was Trump\u2019s failures. It also amounted to a recognition that while Trump trails in the polls, many voters support his handling of the economy.The president has been arguing for months that the economy will regain its momentum when business, restaurants and other operations are allowed to reopen. Some Trump allies were frustrated Thursday that Biden offered his plan before the president announced a similar \u201cBuy American\u201d proposal that officials say has been held up for months amid internal White House objections.ADAD\u201cThey are essentially trying to steal the Trump program of 2016 and steal that playbook,\u201d Trump\u2019s former chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon said on his radio program. \u201cFor some reason, the White House and the campaign have been caught flat-footed. Biden has very smart people around him, particularly on the economic side.\u201dBiden\u2019s pitch underscores a striking shift in both parties away from globalization and free trade and toward protecting American workers and revitalizing struggling domestic industries. Those trends have been accelerated by the coronavirus pandemic, which has wreaked havoc on the economy.Biden said Thursday that his plan would restore the jobs lost this year and create 5 million new ones. It amounted to the most forceful case he has made for reducing dependence on foreign countries to supply the United States with essential goods.ADADBiden repeatedly castigated Trump and sounded populist notes that were reminiscent of his more liberal primary challengers. He stressed the need to protect workers and Main Street rather than the \u201cwealthy investor class\u201d and \u201cbankers and CEOs.\u201d He declared that \u201cenough is enough,\u201d saying it is \u201ctime to reverse the priorities in this country. It\u2019s time to help small businesses, middle-class folks, manage their way through the pandemic.\u201dTrump\u2019s rise in 2016 was built heavily on promises of bringing back American jobs, as well as blaming immigrants for hurting American workers. As president, he has stoked a trade war with China and imposed tariffs that flew in the face of his party\u2019s orthodoxy.Vice President Pence was also in Pennsylvania on Thursday, touting Trump\u2019s economic performance in a talk to business leaders in the borough of Malvern near Philadelphia. While 22 million jobs have been lost during the pandemic, the country has regained 7 million of them, Pence said.ADADWe see \u201cthis country coming back because of the solid foundation that was put in place\u201d by the Trump administration, Pence said, including lower taxes, less regulation, more U.S.-produced energy and better trade agreements. He called it \u201cthe great American comeback.\u201dStill, Trump\u2019s efforts to revive domestic manufacturing produced uneven results even before the pandemic. There were fewer manufacturing workers in Wisconsin this January than there were at any point under the Bush administration, for example.Biden, who once supported the North American Free Trade Agreement and Trans-Pacific Partnership, has in contrast focused his current campaign on prioritizing American industries, following the lead of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), the democratic socialist who was his top rival for the Democratic nomination, and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who released a  \u201cPlan For Economic Patriotism\u201d during the primary and has undergone vetting by Biden\u2019s campaign to be his running mate.ADADBiden and Warren\u2019s teams consulted closely on the new plan, according to two people with knowledge of the situation, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe private talks.The plan won some praise Thursday from liberal leaders. \u201cAll in all, on the right track,\u201d Columbia University economics professor Jeffrey Sachs wrote in an email to The Post. Sachs supported Sanders for president and now backs Biden.Biden\u2019s new platform focuses heavily on using the power of the federal government to promote a U.S. domestic manufacturing base. The $400 billion procurement initiative would be spread over four years to spur demand for American products and services, as would the $300 billion investment in research and breakthrough technologies. Half of the $300 billion would go to clean-energy initiatives and were previously announced.ADADBefore Biden spoke Thursday, he toured the metal works plant with Sen. Robert P. Casey Jr. (D-Pa.) and plant owner Robert McGregor.\u201cHow are you, man?\u201d Biden asked a worker. \u201cI keep distance,\u201d the worker said. Biden wore a mask throughout the tour.Later he delivered his remarks outside at a covered loading dock. It started raining, and Biden invited attendees to seek shelter under the covering as the water loudly pelted the steel roof. Some workers took him up on his offer.Circles were placed in front of Biden\u2019s lectern to encourage listeners to stay within them and maintain social distancing. Reporters had their temperatures taken and were asked coronavirus screening questions as they entered.ADBiden broadened his argument against Trump beyond the economy, criticizing his defense of Confederate symbols, which has been the subject of ongoing debate in the presidential race. Trump is \u201cdetermined to drive us apart to keep his base in place,\u201d the former vice president said.ADHolding a significant lead in the polls, Biden is seeking to close off any possible openings for Trump to make the contest more competitive. He said he plans to unveil proposals next week on infrastructure and clean energy, the second part of what he bills as the \u201cBuild Back Better\u201d plan. The other two components are caregiving and education, and racial equality.Both campaigns are gearing up for an escalating clash over the economy, a normally dominant theme in presidential elections. Trump argues that he built a booming economy before the coronavirus outbreak and could do it again. Biden blames Trump for his erratic reaction to the pandemic and frequent flouting of public health advice, which he says fueled the alarming rate of infections and badly damaged the economy as a result.ADOn the Republican side, White House advisers and allies worried about Biden\u2019s \u201cBuy American\u201d push, with Bannon saying on his radio program that the Democrat\u2019s rollout could help him in such states as Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, which Trump narrowly won in major 2016 upsets.ADTrump aides said the president remains the obvious person to reignite the economy as he has done before.\u201cPresident Trump\u2019s policies of lower taxes, deregulation, reciprocal trade and energy independence built a booming economy once, and they will do so again under his leadership,\u201d said Judd Deere, a White House spokesman.White House officials led by senior Trump adviser Peter Navarro have drafted an executive order requiring federal agencies to buy medical supplies and pharmaceuticals produced in the United States.That executive order has languished for months, however, amid objections by some of Trump\u2019s other senior advisers, including Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Trump\u2019s son-in-law Jared Kushner, who have warned that it could lead China to limit the supply of personal protective equipment, or PPE, that it is sending to the United States.Some analysts said  the executive order could now be signed swiftly, but it remained unclear Thursday when or whether that would happen.When it comes to Biden\u2019s plan, the Democrat\u2019s campaign says he will finance the ongoing costs of his economic agenda by reversing some of Trump\u2019s tax cuts for corporations and imposing \u201ccommon-sense tax reforms that finally make sure the wealthiest Americans pay their fair share.\u201d The campaign declined to provide a more detailed accounting of how it would pay for the $700 billion in spending it  proposed Thursday.A senior Biden campaign official said more specific details would be released once the full plan is out, speaking on the condition of anonymity because the campaign did not authorize the person to speak on the record. Those details would include a stimulus package, which Biden believes will be needed, and continuing costs, the official said.Biden often touts his central role in the Obama administration, but he has been less eager to tout the administration\u2019s championing of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), which proved controversial with the party\u2019s union base. Labor leaders said it did too little to require America\u2019s partners improve their environmental and labor standards.Trump highlighted the shortcomings of the TPP and other trade deals in his 2016 campaign and rejected it upon taking office. Biden has said he wants to renegotiate the agreement, which includes several Asian countries and which supporters say could serve as a bulwark against China\u2019s influence. Thursday\u2019s plan calls for using tax dollars to \u201cstand up to the Chinese government\u2019s abuses, insist on fair trade, and extend opportunity to all Americans.\u201d\u201cTrade negotiations over big trade deals is something that in sequence will follow a dramatic set of domestic investments,\u201d said the senior Biden campaign official. In addition to closing loopholes around existing \u201cBuy American\u201d clauses, Biden is pushing for a crackdown on false advertising of \u201cBuy American\u201d goods.Since the end of the Obama administration, many Democrats have backed off the TPP and focused instead on directly promoting domestic production. Bipartisan momentum has grown in recent weeks for tax incentives for companies to onshore their supply chains, in part because of the gaps in U.S. medical supply production exposed by the pandemic.The nation is facing a new shortage of personal protective equipment, including of N95 masks and medical gowns, as cases rise. But bringing supply chains back to the United States could prove difficult, and the Trump administration has struggled to do so.A Biden administration, like the Trump White House, would face the prospect of foreign retaliation for any promotion of American companies. \u201cBuy American\u201d provisions are also likely to face objections from U.S. firms that would see their costs increase if forced to buy more expensive supplies. Senior Biden officials said Wednesday that their plans were carefully vetted and do not run afoul of World Trade Organization rules.\u201cIncentivizing companies to raise their costs by \u2018Buying American\u2019 is not going to fix almost two decades of low productivity growth \u2014 it\u2019s going to take us in the opposite direction,\u201d said Adam Ozimek, chief economist at Upwork. \u201cThis will just create higher costs for American businesses and consumers.\u201d\n\n\n\n", "comment": "2.4k Comments", "topic": "Politics"}, {"cover": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/HJGX7WGATMI6VCIINCRLT2XJ4A.jpghttps://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/HJGX7WGATMI6VCIINCRLT2XJ4A.jpg", "title": "Who\u2019s afraid of Joe Biden?", "date": "Jul 7, 2020", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/whos-afraid-of-joe-biden/2020/07/07/081b15d8-8e6d-4730-a1b6-83de59842a7b_story.html", "keyword": "presidential election and trade war", "website": "the Washington Post", "author": "David Weigel", "content": "In this edition: Why nobody's afraid of Joe Biden, what's happening in today's Delaware and New Jersey primaries, and how Mount Rushmore entered the veepstakes.Welcome to the only thrice-weekly campaign newsletter that did not take a PPP grant.

According to Ad Analytics, which tracks TV buys, no other commercials by Republican candidates for House or Senate have bothered with Biden, focusing more frequently on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) or Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York.ADFour months after Super Tuesday, four months before the general election, Biden has not become the focus of Republican or conservative attacks at the level of recent Democratic nominees. That\u2019s not for a lack of trying by President Trump\u2019s campaign, which has spent tens of millions of dollars attacking Biden. But the early summer period that\u2019s typically used to define a presidential challenger has left Biden largely undamaged, with Democrats down the ballot happily associating themselves with him.\u201cHillary Clinton had 30 years of hard negatives against her, and Nancy Pelosi was a leader on liberal issues like Obamacare,\u201d said Matt Gorman, a Republican strategist whose stints at the National Republican Congressional Committee produced countless attacks on Pelosi. \u201cThey were in the spotlight in a way that a vice president operating in Barack Obama\u2019s shadow just wasn\u2019t. And Biden has been adept at not always taking the bait on stuff like \u2018defund the police\u2019 or the Green New Deal. He just doesn\u2019t come off as polarizing.\u201dADBiden\u2019s image, and the troubles that Republicans might have in muddying it, was one of the major arguments for his candidacy. That didn\u2019t always inspire Democratic primary voters. In the run-up to Iowa\u2019s caucuses, former Iowa first lady Christie Vilsack urged voters to \u201cthink about the people in the middle\u201d and pick Biden to appeal to them, even if they were more in agreement with another candidate.ADThat argument didn\u2019t sell in Iowa or New Hampshire, but it clicked in South Carolina and quickly got Biden the nomination. The months since then have been a study in Republican frustration, with Biden\u2019s personal favorable rating holding steady in the high 40s and no particular personal attack on Biden breaking through with focus groups.\u201cYou can try to paint him as a radical, but it\u2019s not going to work,\u201d Vilsack\u2019s husband, former agriculture secretary Tom Vilsack, said in an interview. \u201cThere may be a lot of reasons, both in terms of race and in terms of gender, that made Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton susceptible to that kind of stuff. Joe Biden is a white guy.\u201dADThat\u2019s one theory for why Biden, despite two previous runs for president, has simply not churned up much voter anger. No recent Democratic nominee has entered the summer of a presidential election without a clear effort to portray them as dangerous. By this point in 2016, the conservative publisher Regnery was selling eight books about Hillary Clinton; by this point in 2012, it was selling 13 books about Barack Obama.ADThe publisher is offering just one book about this year\u2019s nominee, the upcoming \u201cThe Biden Deception,\u201d\u00a0which asks whether Biden is a \u201ccrypto-socialist.\u201d That\u2019s it, and no other books critical of Biden, specifically, are being published right now. Dinesh D\u2019Souza, who produced election-year books and documentaries about both Obama and Clinton, is now selling \u201cThe United States of Socialism,\u201d in which Biden appears only a few times as a \u201csocialist lite,\u201d with more attention paid to the business dealings of Biden\u2019s son Hunter and brother Jimmy than to Biden\u2019s own record. Peter Schweizer, whose \u201cClinton Cash\u201d and related 2016 articles provided ammo for the Trump campaign, dealt briefly with Biden in a book about \u201cAmerica's progressive elite.\u201d\u00a0David Freddoso, a conservative journalist who published\u00a0\u201cThe Case Against Barack Obama\u201d\u00a0for Regnery in August 2008, watched it hit the New York Times bestseller list, then published two more takedowns of the 44th president. He doubted that there would be as much interest in a similar Biden book.AD\u201cThere was a real hunger for knowledge about Obama in 2008,\u201d Freddoso said. \u201cHe was intriguing and unknown. People perceived him as something different, and as someone with a future. Biden can't pretend to be any of those things. He's also running against an incumbent who is everyone's center of attention. If your goal is to generate interest and sell books, you're probably better off this time writing about Trump.\u201dADThere has been digging into Biden\u2019s record, but none of it has stirred conservative passions. The Republican National Committee briefly campaigned for the release of Biden\u2019s Senate papers, which are being held by the University of Delaware until after his career in \u201cpublic life\u201d is over. But it has not mentioned that issue since May 12, a night-and-day difference with the demands Clinton faced for her emails or that Obama faced for his birth and college records.\u00a0The conservative group Judicial Watch has sued for those papers and sued for Hunter Biden\u2019s business records, but neither effort has gotten much attention. In a recent, seven-minute segment with Judicial Watch\u2019s Tom Fitton, Fox Business host Lou Dobbs repeatedly pivoted to other stories, asking Fitton about the Supreme Court\u2019s electoral college ruling and the president\u2019s July 3 speech at Mount Rushmore.AD\u201cI want to take up the Biden issue, and I\u2019m talking about the Hunter Biden issue, with 10 percent ownership in that private equity, Chinese, private equity firm,\u201d Dobbs said. \u201cBut I want to get a sense, from you, as to the president taking on, for the first time, corporate America and its role in this left-wing fascism that is being bred in this country.\u201dADRepublican attacks on Biden have adjusted to the candidate's outrage-deficient image. In its own advertising, the Trump campaign portrays Biden as \u201cweak\u201d and \u201cdeclining,\u201d arguing that he would not truly be running the country if he won the election. In a Fourth of July tweet, sometime Trump adviser Newt Gingrich wrote that he was not \u201cafraid of Joe Biden\u201d but afraid of the Democrats his win would empower.\u00a0\u201cPrecisely because Biden is weak he would be dominated by Pelosi and Schumer,\u201d Gingrich wrote. In a column three days later, former New Hampshire senator Judd Gregg went further, arguing without evidence that \u201cthe socialist/progressive wing of the Democratic Party\u201d would engineer a \u201ccoup\u201d if Biden won, installing a new left-wing president that the country had never gotten to vet.AD\u201cWithin a few months of assuming the presidency, Biden may find himself being the next statue toppled as the socialist/progressive movement moves closer to power,\u201d Gregg wrote. \u201cReplacing him with his vice president could be deemed necessary to the cause.\u201dADAt the start of the year, Republicans hoped to be running against of those other Democrats. Ahead of the South Carolina primary, as Biden reeled, Republicans prepared to mourn him: a Democrat they could do business with, defeated by his party's radical left.\u201cI\u2019d say he\u2019s probably the most likely one to have a chance at beating Donald Trump,\u201d former House speaker Paul D. Ryan told CNBC in February. \u201cBut I don\u2019t see Joe getting the nomination, I just don\u2019t see him getting there. I think it\u2019s going be one of these progressives, which I think will be much easier to beat.\u201dADFive months later, the Democratic nominee has given Republicans little to work with, and even his critics inside the party are delighted. At his June 30 news conference in Wilmington, Biden distanced himself from protesters who've torn down, or called for the removal, of statues celebrating America's founders. In lieu of a gaffe, Republicans accused him of being too meek to condemn those protesters.AD\u201cDems support the riots. The vandals. The anarchists,\u201d Sen.

Wootson Jr.A guide to racial politics in an older conservative stronghold.In the statesThe Democratic presidential primary is not over. Yes, Joe Biden has secured enough delegates to win the nomination on the first ballot. Yes, his Democratic rivals have endorsed him. But three states and Puerto Rico, all of which had delayed their primaries due to the coronavirus pandemic, are finally picking delegates this week. And former Bernie Sanders campaign staffers are still encouraging supporters to back him and increase his clout at the DNC.Two of those states vote today, Delaware and New Jersey. (Louisiana votes this weekend.) In the former vice president's adopted home state, he's favored to win all 21 delegates, thanks both to his local strength and to the state's demographics.\u00a0Black voters regularly make up a third of the Democratic electorate in Delaware, and the state's biggest population center, New Castle County, contains the kind of suburbs that rallied behind Biden when the primary was still competitive. Combine that with Sanders's weakness in the Maryland counties that border rural Delaware, and Elizabeth Warren's presence on the ballot, and it may be a stretch for Sanders to hit the 15 percent of the vote needed to secure a delegate. The most interesting aspect of the election may be that Delaware used it to experiment with online, secured voting, though it halted that after concerns were raised by voters.There are 126 delegates at stake in New Jersey, the biggest prize still left on the calendar; like Delaware, it wasn't friendly territory for Sanders four years ago. (He won 37 percent of the vote there, compared with 39 percent in the First State.) Like Texas, New Jersey assigns some of its delegates statewide and the rest to winners in state legislative districts. Sanders won just one of those districts, in red and rural northwest New Jersey, four years ago, and he ran strongly around college campuses. Unlike Delawareans, New Jersey voters will have just two candidates on their ballots, but they'll have an \u201cuncommitted\u201d option, too, and the choice of a no-name protest vote has probably cost Sanders delegates in other states, such as Kentucky.Delaware won't hold the rest of its statewide elections until September, but New Jersey's congressional primaries will end tomorrow, and four of them are worth watching. The bitterest race is in the 2nd District, which Rep. Jeff Van Drew won as a Democrat two years ago, only to switch parties when polling found his vote against impeachment potentially costing him the seat in a primary. (Van Drew has since flipped on a multitude of issues, co-sponsoring statehood for D.C. before voting against it.) He faces an intraparty challenge from Bob Patterson, who ran in a different seat on the other side of the state four years ago and has spent only around $200,000 on this race.Five Democrats are fighting for the right to face Van Drew. The strongest fundraiser has been Amy Kennedy, the wife of former Rhode Island congressman Patrick Kennedy, making her first run for office. Local Democratic support had gone to Brigid Callahan Harrison, a Montclair State University political scientist; Kennedy has tried to jujitsu that against Harrison, portraying herself as an anti-machine candidate, even though her husband had tried to win south Jersey Democratic boss George Norcross over to her campaign. Will Cunningham, a former Hill staffer who ran unsuccessfully in the 2018 primary, has struggled to break through, with liberal groups such as the Working Families Party sticking with Kennedy, seeking to avoid the 2018 vote split that helped Van Drew win in the first place. Two other Democrats are on the ballot but have done little campaigning.Democrats flipped three other New Jersey House seats two years ago, all of them heading for very different November races. In the 3rd District, either venture capitalist David Richter or county politician Kate Gibbs will win the right to face Rep. Andy Kim. In the 7th District, state Sen. Tom Kean, the son of the state's most popular living Republican governor, is already one of the party's strongest recruits; he's expected to beat two gadfly candidates and face Rep. Tom Malinowski. (There are no primaries in the 11th District, where Rep. Mikie Sherrill already knows her GOP opponent, former Hill aide Rosemary Becchi.)The rest of Tuesday's contrast are Democratic family feuds, with left-wing candidates working to best incumbents who've outspent them and, in the past, rolled past opposition easily. In the 5th District, which moderate Rep. Josh Gottheimer is the first Democrat to represent, city councilor Arati Kreibich has run from the left, arguing that constituents can do better than a congressman who frequently votes against party leadership and with Republicans. But since getting organized after the 2016 election, insurgent Democrats have struggled to beat incumbents in swing seats; the 5th District has been moving toward the party but was carried by the president four years ago by a single point.The 8th District is one of the safest Democratic seats in New Jersey and a test for whether the kind of campaign that elected Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in New York can win across the river. Hector Oseguera is the first serious challenger to Rep. Albio Sires, who won the seat 14 years ago and has made few waves in Congress. Oseguera won an early victory when he secured the \u201cA\u201d line on the ballot, the first one voters see in the booth; the district's Democratic leaders countered that by making sure Joe Biden led the \u201cB\u201d line, the one Sires would appear under. While Oseguera has spent just $42,183 on the race, Sires, who does not face credible Republican challengers, spent and raised less than $400,000, a pittance in a safe seat. (New York Rep. Eliot Engel spent nearly $1.4 million on his primary against challenger Jamaal Bowman, which has yet to be called.)Ad watchBrigid Callahan Harrison, \u201cCory Booker.\u201d The Democrat who has locked up the most institutional support in today's key House primary has made the most of it, here using the state's best-known (and widely liked) Democratic figure to encourage voters to turn in ballots. \u201cThere's a reason firefighters, grocery store workers, and laborers support Brigid Harrison,\u201d Booker says; a reflection of coronavirus-era politics, with grocery workers mentioned in the same breath as jobs more commonly mentioned in ads.Amy Kennedy, \u201cMatters.\u201d The well-funded quasi-outsider's closing ad looks like the sort that Democrats have been running everywhere, from a loose focus on \u201caffordable\u201d health care to rebuilding after the pandemic.

But it does a monthly check of the president's approval rating, and after finding a rise in the start of the year, it has found voters drifting away since the start of the coronavirus pandemic. The headlines focused on Trump's 38 percent approval rating \u2014 well below the number incumbent presidents have been elected with \u2014 but it's the withering of swing-vote support that tells the story. Just one demographic group, white voters without college degrees, supports the president with a clear majority. Meanwhile, while 48 percent of white voters with degrees backed Trump four years ago, per exit polling, just 33 percent of them approve of his performance now.Candidate trackerJoe Biden's do-no-harm campaigning continued through and past the holiday weekend, with no public events, some fundraising and the aforementioned video celebrating the Fourth of July.

Tammy Duckworth of Illinois has only recently been mentioned as a top vice presidential option for Joe Biden; over 36 hours, she became the most talked-about candidate. On Sunday, Duckworth appeared on CNN's \u201cState of the Union\u201d to discuss the president's Mount Rushmore speech and fell into some of the culture war traps that Biden had avoided.\u201cHe spent all his time talking about dead traitors,\u201d Duckworth said. \u201cRemember that the president at Mount Rushmore was standing on ground that was stolen from Native Americans who had actually been given that land during a treaty.\u201d When asked by CNN's Dana Bash whether statues of George Washington should be taken down, Duckworth said \u201cwe should listen to everybody\u201d and \u201clisten to the argument there.\u201dThat led to a full day of rebukes, capped with a Fox News monologue by Tucker Carlson that accused the \u201cunimpressive\u201d senator of not loving America.

Doug Jones (D-Ala.). The result culminated four months of Trump imploring Alabama\u2019s voters to reject Sessions, the man who the president once said he leaned on for advice in forming his \u201cAmerica First\u201d agenda.Running for his old Senate seat \u2014 which he abandoned in early 2017 to become Trump\u2019s attorney general \u2014 Sessions endured one brutal insult after another from the president. Trump\u2019s endorsement of Tuberville in the race has always seemed to have more to do with Trump\u2019s anger at Sessions over his recusing himself from the Russia investigation while attorney general than with any particular support for the former Auburn University football coach.Track the results in the Sessions-Tuberville runoff\u201cI will tell you, I got to know Jeff Sessions very well,\u201d Trump told Tuberville supporters on a conference call Monday night, \u201cI made a mistake when I put him in as the attorney general.

His victory was declared quickly \u2014  a final humiliation for Sessions, who was once so untouchable that Alabama Democrats didn\u2019t field an opponent against him in his 2014 reelection.ADRather than fight Trump, who remains very popular among Alabama Republicans, Sessions spent the final months of the campaign pledging his loyalty to a president who constantly demeans him. He told voters that he was, in fact, the real pro-Trump candidate because he had spent so much time working on the immigration and trade policies that are the centerpiece of the president\u2019s agenda.ADEmerging from casting his own ballot Tuesday morning, Sessions made one final, almost sad, assertion that he would be a Trump purist if he won his old seat back, noting that several staunch conservatives had overcome the president\u2019s endorsement of other candidates in recent weeks.\u201cIn all three, the candidate who actually won was a stronger supporter of the Trump agenda,\u201d Sessions told reporters.ADIn one Senate race, in a state that gave rise to the nativist underpinnings of Trumpism, the president made clear the real central tenet of his ideology: loyalty.Fealty to the president takes precedence over every other ideological standard.A onetime Alabama favorite son hopes to win back his Senate seat. Trump stands in the way.Take last weekend.On Friday night, Trump went to bed after commuting the federal prison sentence of his longtime friend and adviser Roger Stone, who had been convicted of lying to Congress to shield Trump from investigators examining Russian interference in the 2016 election. Stone never yielded, never gave the FBI anything on Trump, and the president wiped out Stone\u2019s sentence days before he was to go to prison.ADADTrump started his Saturday by excoriating Sessions for the perceived offense of not doing enough to stop or undermine the Russia investigation. \u201cJeff Sessions is a disaster who has let us all down. We don\u2019t want him back,\u201d Trump tweeted at 8:36 a.m. Saturday.The FBI investigation, begun in July 2016, started well before Sessions set foot in the Justice Department and well before he took the advice of career prosecutors to recuse himself from the investigation, given his prominent role on the Trump campaign and because he had met with the Russian ambassador in the run-up to the election.The president argues that the recusal led to the appointment of a special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, to conduct an investigation that haunted much of his first three years in office.ADDefenders of the former attorney general say privately that with the investigation already underway, it would have continued even if Sessions had not recused himself and that it just would have been run inside the corridors of the main Justice Department.ADSessions is not the first high-level adviser to face Trump\u2019s public wrath, and there probably will be others, but none has faced such an utter and continued humiliation as Sessions, the rare banished sidekick who tried to restart a life in public service.Several members of Trump\u2019s first Cabinet and early inner circle have found themselves on the receiving end of a sharp-tongued tweet or public insult from a president who has faced record turnover among his top aides.ADTrump called Rex Tillerson, his first secretary of state, \u201cdumb as a rock\u201d after he left the administration. He blasted his first defense secretary, Jim Mattis, as \u201cour Country\u2019s most overrated General,\u201d after Mattis spoke out and called Trump a threat to democracy.Trump accused his former chief of staff, John Kelly, of being in \u201cway over his head\u201d and going out \u201cwith a whimper.\u201dAD\u201cLike so many X\u2019s, he misses the action & just can\u2019t keep his mouth shut,\u201d Trump wrote on Twitter in February.White House aides including Omarosa Manigault Newman, Stephen K. Bannon, Anthony Scaramucci and former national security adviser John Bolton, and former White House counsel Donald McGahn also have faced withering public attacks from the president.ADTrump has described Washington as a \u201cswamp\u201d that is \u201cvicious, horrible, ugly and evil, much worse than I thought\u201d and has publicly lamented the lack of loyalty he has perceived in the nation\u2019s capital.Those considered insufficiently loyal include several Republican lawmakers, whom Trump also has targeted with public insults. Trump recently attacked Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) and Sen. Patrick J. Toomey (R-Pa.) as \u201cRINO\u2019s\u201d \u2014 shorthand for Republicans in name only \u2014 after both men voiced concerns about the president\u2019s commutation of Stone\u2019s sentence.ADBut unlike the other outcasts, Sessions was so central to the president\u2019s political origination that he seemed destined to remain at center stage throughout the Trump show. He was careful to praise, not cross, Trump since being fired, unlike many of the other former officials Trump has publicly trashed.By the summer of 2015, as most Republicans dismissed Trump\u2019s chances of winning the Republican presidential nomination, Sessions became a senior adviser to the real estate heir. Their views on immigration and trade, out of step with traditional GOP orthodoxy, meshed.As Trump railed against immigrants, Sessions drew closer. The Alabamian\u2019s top advisers in the Senate went to work on the campaign. Among them was Stephen Miller, who is now Trump\u2019s top domestic policy aide.The Sessions-led Justice Department formed the early legal opinions for controversial moves such as trying to deny U.S. entry to citizens of several majority-Muslim nations.ADBut then he recused himself from the Russia case, setting in motion Mueller\u2019s appointment. That was a perceived sin from which he could never recover in Trump\u2019s eyes.Sessions\u2019s defenders say he tried to inoculate the integrity of the Justice Department from the most politically sensitive investigation in the nation.Instead, liberal activists bemoaned the complicated conclusions in the Mueller report, which never explicitly accused senior Trump officials of a crime, and conservatives heard over and over from Trump that the investigation was a \u201cwitch hunt.\u201dAnd Sessions left himself wounded for his own political future. Trump fired him Nov. 7, 2018, and Sessions entered the race for the nomination to take on Sen. Doug Jones (D) \u2014 who won the seat in a December 2017 special election after the GOP nominee, Roy Moore, was accused of pursuing romantic interests with teenage girls while he was a lawyer in his 30s.Alabama Republicans, hoping to reclaim a seat they fumbled away three years ago, made the race a priority years ago. Tuberville, Rep. Bradley Byrne (R-Ala.) and Moore jumped into the race in early 2019, but then Sessions made a late entry.A onetime Alabama favorite son hopes to win back his Senate seat. Trump stands in the way.Trump, under the encouragement of the state\u2019s senior Republican, Sen. Richard C. Shelby, stayed out of the initial ballot, but a week after Sessions and Tuberville advanced to the runoff, the president threw his support behind the former football coach.Tuberville will enter the contest with Jones functionally broke.GOP strategists think Jones, who had raised more than $15 million by March 30 and has been spending on largely positive ads, will immediately launch a sharp negative attack on Tuberville, who will be scrambling to raise money for the general election.Republicans will be heavily reliant on two outside conservative groups, the Club for Growth and One Nation, which have booked about $5\u00a0million worth of advertising.The ads, strategists said, are expected to focus heavily on Jones\u2019s voting record, including his support for convicting and removing Trump from office during the impeachment trial  this year and his October 2018 vote against the confirmation of now-Supreme Court Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh.They hope this will buy enough time for the Tuberville to reload a campaign war chest and take over the line of attack later in the summer in a race Republicans are confident they will win.\n\n\n\n", "comment": "1.9k Comments", "topic": "Politics"}, {"cover": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/UGCT4YEBAUI6TNMF4NVRNJJRVI.jpghttps://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/UGCT4YEBAUI6TNMF4NVRNJJRVI.jpg", "title": "Can Taiwan survive a second Trump term?", "date": "Jul 14, 2020", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/07/14/can-taiwan-survive-second-trump-term/", "keyword": "presidential election and trade war", "website": "the Washington Post", "author": "Frida Ghitis", "content": "As Beijing has steadily tightened its grip on Hong Kong, no one has watched with more alarm than the people of Taiwan.

Officially, the administration has a firm stand on China. The National Defense Strategy of 2018 repeatedly refers to Beijing\u2019s militaristic and predatory behavior as a challenge that the United States needs to counteract.ADThe president, however, has a long track record of lavishing praise on Xi \u2014 a \u201cfriend of mine\u201d and an \u201cincredible guy\u201d \u2014 and paying little attention to matters other than trade. His attacks on China\u2019s role in the novel coronavirus pandemic look more like blame-shifting than sincere concern about Chinese authoritarianism.The United States committed itself to protecting Taiwan when it recognized the People\u2019s Republic of China and withdrew recognition of Taiwan. The Taiwan Relations Act (TRA) of 1979 (for which then-Sen. Joe Biden voted) aimed to ensure that Taiwan\u2019s future is determined by peaceful means. Anything else, the TRA said, would be deemed \u201ca threat to the peace and security of the Western Pacific area and of grave concern to the United States.\u201d The United States vowed to \u201cmaintain the capacity\u201d to \u201cresist any resort to force or other forms of coercion\u201d of Taiwan.ADThat has been U.S. policy for four decades.

In his recent memoir, former national security adviser John Bolton recounts Xi\u2019s repeated efforts to convince Trump that Taiwan belongs to China, and that the relationship between the United States and China would suffer if the United States ignored that. Trump appeared to acquiesce.ADAs Bolton recalls, Trump would \u201cpoint to the tip of one of his Sharpies and say, \u2018This is Taiwan,\u2019 then point to the Resolute desk and say, 'This is China.\u2019\u201dWould China make a move against Taiwan? Until recently, Beijing would have been deterred by international opinion and the prospect of pushback from the United States.ADBut lately, Beijing has become increasingly willing to flout international views. The imposition of a new security law in Hong Kong disregards Beijing\u2019s commitment to the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d principle it made in 1997, when Britain handed over the territory and China promised that Hong Kong would remain free until 2047.ADHong Kong is only one place where Beijing has shown a willingness to flex its muscle. In Xinjiang province, it has built concentration camps \u2014 it calls them reeducation camps \u2014 where it holds more than a million ethnic Uighurs, a Muslim minority, despite the world\u2019s protestations. It\u2019s the largest imprisonment of a religious minority since the Holocaust.According to Bolton, during one of their meetings, Xi told Trump about the camps. The interpreter said Trump\u2019s response was that building camps was the right thing to do. On the day that tidbit became public, Trump signed a bill aiming to punish China for abusing Uighurs.ADThere\u2019s little reason to expect Trump would stand up for Taiwan out of a sense of loyalty or moral outrage.ADBeyond its frontiers, China has been pushing against India\u2019s border, expanding control of international waters in the South China Sea, buzzing Taiwan with fighter jets and generally seeking to expand its influence through diplomacy, finances, and intimidation.If China decided to make a military play for Taiwan, Trump, who talks a hawkish game but doesn\u2019t always walk it, might be persuaded to stand up to China. But from what we have seen, his instinct would cry out against U.S. involvement for a small ally, especially if it would spoil relations with a powerful trading partner.As for Biden, he is hardly a hawk. There are no guarantees for Taiwan regardless of the election\u2019s outcome, which is why Taipei is rushing to bolster its military capabilities. But Biden is committed to the status quo in Taiwan; he has spoken out forcefully against Xi\u2019s treatment of Uighurs and in support of Taiwan\u2019s \u201cthriving democracy.\u201d He intends to return U.S. foreign policy to the pre-Trump track of safeguarding U.S. alliances and valuing democracy. That stance alone would give Beijing pause before acting against Taiwan.ADADAll considered, Biden looks like a safer bet than Trump for the survival of Taiwan\u2019s independence from the increasingly aggressive regime in Beijing.Read more:John Pomfret: The Hong Kong security law could be China\u2019s blueprint to deal with the \u2018Taiwan problem\u2019Josh Rogin: The pandemic shows why Taiwan is a far better partner than the People\u2019s RepublicArthur Tam: Hong Kong and Taiwan are cultural powerhouses.

Then the killing of George Floyd, a Black American, by a White Minneapolis police officer in May sparked renewed focus on the global debate about the causes of the world\u2019s searing inequalities, why they\u2019ve been tolerated for so long and what can be done to reduce them.Support our journalism.

What did the pandemic reveal?Densely populated poor and minority areas emerged as coronavirus hot spots and suffered disproportionate deaths in hard-hit countries including the U.S., the U.K. and Brazil. While the well-off hibernated in home offices and vacation properties, the essential workers who stock grocery store shelves and staff nursing homes continued to risk their lives on the front lines. Low-wage workers were hit disproportionately hard by job cuts. In the U.S., where unemployment reached the highest since the Great Depression era, pictures of snaking lines at food banks went viral. This all served as a backdrop to Floyd\u2019s death, which touched off the biggest civil rights movement in the U.S. since the 1960s and protests around the world.ADAD2. How did the world respond?Rich countries mobilized trillions of dollars of pandemic relief for their citizens, while poorer countries in Latin America and Africa struggled to cobble together aid. Governments stepped in to shore up safety nets and health systems. European companies flocked to government programs that kept millions of workers on the payroll for several months. The U.S. government stepped in to provide more robust benefits than ever before, including stimulus checks for households and previously unheard-of provisions such as tax credits for paid sick leave and unemployment insurance for gig workers. Vigorous debates erupted about how rescue funds were being channeled and whether they might \u2014 as was widely perceived after the 2008 financial crisis \u2014 bail out Wall Street at the expense of Main Street.3. Will the crisis widen inequality?ADADIt\u2019s looking that way. The World Bank warned that the pandemic could reverse years of progress for the poor in less-developed nations such as India and Nigeria, with as many as 100 million more people expected to fall into extreme poverty. Almost 40% of U.S. job losses were falling on those making less than $40,000, according to Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, who warned that long-term joblessness could be a drag the economy. What\u2019s more, when Black Americans \u2014 who are twice as likely to live in poverty \u2014 lost jobs they regained them more slowly than Whites. The dichotomy even jarred the investor class in June as the U.S. stock market, aided by the Fed\u2019s relief efforts, surged higher during the same weeks that the Black Lives Matter protests convulsed the nation.4. What exactly is meant by inequality?The term has evolved into a catchall for various related ills including poverty, wage stagnation, class division and social disorder. Over the last few years, populist leaders have won office in Italy, Mexico, the U.S. and elsewhere by, in part, tapping into anxieties among people who see the economy as stacked against them. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the elite club of 37 mostly rich countries, says inequality within its member nations is at the highest level in 50 years. The richest 1% earn, on average, nine times the income of the poorest 10%. The world\u2019s billionaires have more than twice the wealth of the rest of humanity combined, a 2019 Oxfam report found.ADAD5. Could the pandemic change things?Catastrophic events such as the pandemic have historically been a catalyst for reshuffling the economic order. During the Great Depression, with the New Deal, American workers gained a safety net. After World War II they won leverage with employers and higher pay.6. Isn\u2019t inequality just part of capitalism?Yes. Capitalism\u2019s profit motive provides incentives for people to act and take risks, which inevitably produces winners and losers. But French economist Thomas Piketty, who ignited academic study with his 2013 book \u201cCapital in the Twenty-First Century,\u201d sees discussions about reviving the post-pandemic economy as an opportunity to \u201cchange the dominant ideology in terms of how you deal with inequality and how you regulate the economy.\u201dADThe Search for SolutionsADTax the rich (more)\u2022 In the U.S., the Democratic Party, pulled to the left by its invigorated progressive wing, is percolating with proposals to tax the assets, income, inheritances or financial transactions of the affluent. Former Vice President Joe Biden, the party\u2019s presumptive nominee to run against President Donald Trump in the Nov. 3 election, wants to restore the top tax rate to 39.6%, its level before Trump\u2019s 2017 tax cuts dropped it to 37%. Biden also would double the levy on capital gains to 39.6% for taxpayers earning more than $1 million annually. There\u2019s also a global consensus around the need to shutter tax havens. Meanwhile, the pandemic has accelerated plans in several countries to raise revenue through a new \u201cdigital tax\u201d on the local sales of rich U.S. companies such as Facebook, Google and Netflix.ADCount headsAD\u2022 Efforts to hire, retain and promote minorities have largely failed to get more underrepresented groups into the highest-paying jobs. Quotas \u2014 or preset numerical targets \u2014 have a proven track record in Norway and California for getting more women on corporate boards, though the idea raises hackles even with metrics-obsessed executives. Still, with many companies reframing their thinking on inequality, several rolled out hiring targets or tied executive pay to hitting diversity goals. German sportswear brand Adidas AG promised that at least 30% of new U.S. hires would be Black or Latino. BlackRock Inc. committed to increasing its Black workforce 30% by 2024 and doubling the portion of senior leaders from its current 3% share. There are also calls to force more companies to disclose data on the racial and gender makeup of their workforce.Pay for past wrongsAD\u2022 Global protests against racism have renewed calls to pay reparations to correct legacy wrongdoings. In the U.K., centuries-old institutions have acknowledged their connections to Britain\u2019s slave trade, with insurer Lloyd\u2019s of London pledging in June to donate an unspecified amount to charities promoting opportunities for Black and minority groups. Proposals to compensate African Americans for the shackles of slavery reach into the trillions of dollars. Interim steps might include federally funded trust funds for Black children that could be tapped in adulthood to pay for education, start a business or purchase a home. In a 2019 Gallup poll, only 29% of Americans supported the idea of paying the descendants of slaves, but that number was up from 14% in 2002.ADReconsider the role of central banks\u2022 In the U.S. and elsewhere, central bankers face questions about how their policies might be disproportionately helping the rich. Even in the strong pre-pandemic economy, minorities struggled to make meaningful progress toward closing gaps in employment, earnings and wealth. Central bankers are considering whether a more relaxed approach to inflation could help narrow labor-market disparities. While Fed officials stress that monetary policy has a limited ability to target things like Black unemployment, they\u2019re pressing lawmakers more openly for government spending and other steps to help ease inequality.ADLighten the load on poorer countries\u2022 More than 100 nations staring down the humanitarian and economic shocks of the pandemic have asked the International Monetary Fund for help. Global leaders backed a moratorium on foreign debt payments for some of the world\u2019s poorest countries to the end of the year; some $730 billion was scheduled to come due this year. Countries including Angola and Pakistan have requested relief. China said it would help African nations facing \u201cthe greatest strain.\u201d Ultimately there may need to be a broad program to help poorer countries restructure their loans, similar to the Brady Plan of the late 1980s.ADStrengthen unions and boost wagesAD\u2022 The plight of essential workers during the pandemic drew attention to the lack of labor protections and low pay for those who keep society running. Some front-line workers in the U.S. began organizing and agitating for more rights, with walk-outs at Amazon, grocery delivery service Instacart and meat processor Perdue Farms. One possible answer is stronger unions. Many countries are seeing a push for employers to pay a \u201cliving wage\u201d that lifts workers out of poverty. Economists are also studying how a higher concentration of big companies in some industries has eroded the bargaining power of workers, and how breakups of dominant firms might help address that.Provide a universal basic income\u2022 With automation raising fears about how robots might eliminate jobs, politicians and business leaders have floated the idea of a stipend for every citizen, also known as universal basic income. Former U.S. presidential candidate and entrepreneur Andrew Yang made it the central pillar of his platform, calling for a $1,000-a-month \u201cfreedom dividend\u201d for every American adult. Cities around the world that have experimented with the idea have had modest success. Finland ended a two-year trial run in 2018 with little fanfare, but preliminary findings showed that the monthly payments improved well-being for participants. The mayor of Stockton, California, which began giving 125 residents $500 a month in February 2019, is trying to expand the idea with a movement called Mayors for a Guaranteed Income.ADReform capitalism\u2022 So-called stakeholder capitalism demands that companies balance the interests of shareholders with those of employees, customers and society. In August 2019, Business Roundtable, an association of U.S. chief executive officers, endorsed the idea. In Europe, company goals have traditionally been closer to that view, with Germany requiring 50% employee representation on large corporations\u2019 supervisory boards, which make strategic decisions. Another model is Scandinavia, which uses high taxes to offset inequality. Governments can also expand targeted programs to address areas where the capitalist system falls short of societal needs, such as building affordable housing.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P.", "comment": "0 Comments", "topic": "Business"}, {"cover": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/TAKR6GF4DAI6VF6BNTYRN77CNQ.jpghttps://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/TAKR6GF4DAI6VF6BNTYRN77CNQ.jpg", "title": "Power Up: Trump is touting an enthusiasm gap with Biden.

It's not uncommon for candidates to start the day in one state, attend an event in another, campaign some more in a third, and then overnight somewhere else entirely. Then they do it again the next day.\u00a0Now, of course, the novel coronavirus pandemic has changed all that.\u00a0ADAnd, in some very tangible ways, that has been a boon for presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden, who polls show has gotten a significant bump while he's stayed out of the spotlight and in the \u201cbasement,\u201d as critics like to say, ceding the rest of the house to President Trump.\u00a0ADIt's not you, it's me: Democratic voters appear highly motivated headed into November. But not necessarily to rally around Biden as much as to oust Trump.New polling data shows Biden is, to many of these voters, in some ways beside the point.We\u2019ve all seen the slew of recent polling showing Biden with significant leads in key battleground states, including Arizona, Florida, Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and North Carolina. (The typical caveats apply: poll numbers can and will change.)\u00a0ADDigging into the cross tabs of a recent New York Times/Siena College battleground state poll \u2014 taken early to mid-June \u2014 we also find the dramatic extent to which both Trump and Biden voters are motivated by \u2026 Trump.\u00a0When the president\u2019s supporters in Florida and Arizona were asked, \u201cIs your vote more of a vote for Donald Trump or a vote against Joe Biden?\u201d about 80 percent said it was an affirmative vote for Trump.When Biden voters in those two states were asked the same question, more than 60 percent in each state said their vote was more \u201ca vote against Donald Trump\u201d while about 35 said their vote was more \u201ca vote for Joe Biden.\u201dThe trends were similar in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and Michigan, key swing states Trump won in 2016, where a majority of Biden supporters said their choice of the Democrat represented more of a vote against Trump.It's not just Democrats:Polls show independent voters supporting Biden are particularly motivated by Trump, with 78 percent of independents in Florida saying their vote for Biden is more a vote against the president, and around 70 percent of independents saying the same in the key states of Arizona, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.Biden leads Trump among independents by around 20 percentage points in Arizona, Florida, North Carolina and Pennsylvania; and by 7 and 9 percentage points in Wisconsin and Michigan, respectively.An enthusiasm gap: Trump and his campaign aides are fretting about the recent string of bad news. They've tried to parry it by arguing Republicans are far more enthusiastic about the president than Democrats are about the former vice president. \u00a0\u201cPresident Trump has historic support within his own party,\u201d the campaign said in a memo sent to reporters last week.\u00a0AD\u201cAnd when it comes to the most important factor, enthusiasm, President Trump is dominating. The unprecedented enthusiasm behind the president\u2019s reelection efforts stands in stark contrast to the flat, almost nonexistent enthusiasm for Biden,\u201d campaign manager Brad Parscale wrote in a Post op-ed today.\u00a0This is the dreaded \u201centhusiasm gap\u201d about which strategists often like to talk.\u00a0But Trump campaign advisers may have turned this dynamic upside down to show a stronger picture than exists for the president.ADRepublicans are enthusiastic about voting for Trump, but it's also clear Democrats \u00a0\u2014 even those for whom Biden was their second or third choice as the party's nominee \u2014 are pretty excited about voting against the president.It's perhaps that dynamic on which the strategists should be focusing.Base politics: Meanwhile, the president\u2019s public remarks on the George Floyd protests and the pandemic \u2014 which he has repeatedly called the \u201cKung flu\u201d \u2014 have been highly inflammatory, signaling Trump is doubling down on the culture wars that animated his first presidential campaign \u00a0Those instincts might help shore up support among his base but they also turn up the sense of urgency among those who do not like what they see and hear.\u00a0\u00a0Already, the 2018 midterms showed that white, college-educated women had significant reservations about the president.\u00a0With the United States undergoing a dramatic transformation in public consensus around race and structural racism, Trump's highly divisive message garners negative headlines. But it does little to expand his political coalition.\u00a0ADADKey quote: \u201cThe President\u2019s message is the same as it was in 2016. The country has changed, but his messaging has not,\u201d said Whit Ayres, a prominent Republican pollster.Trump weighed in yesterday in a tweet by contending painting \u201cBlack Lives Matters\u201d on Fifth Avenue in New York \u2014 proposed by mayor Bill de Blasio (D) \u2014 would be \u201ca symbol of hate\u201d despite widespread support for the peaceful protests against racism and police violence.The day before, the president dug in on his defense of Confederate iconography, warning in a tweet he would veto a defense bill renaming Fort Bragg and other military bases named after confederate military leaders.Laying low: Meanwhile, Biden's camp has appeared perfectly content allowing the campaign to unfold without much attention falling on the former\u00a0vice president, who in the past has been prone to misspeaking \u2014 even as this has especially irked organizers and voters of color who would like to hear him speak more\u00a0forcefully\u00a0about efforts to defund police departments (something he doesn't support). \u00a0The strategy, as my colleague Michael Scherer wrote earlier this week in an excellent piece, has reinforced the\u00a0frame of the 2020 election as a referendum on Trump himself.\u00a0\u201cThe contrast extends to their public travel,\u201d Michael wrote. \u201cOver the last 10 days, Trump logged about 4,000 miles on Air Force One to hold events in three states, including two rallies that attracted thousands of people.\u201d\u201cBiden\u00a0held\u00a0two remote local television interviews and a couple of virtual events and took a one-hour drive from his home to the courtyard of a Lancaster, Pa., recreation center, where he met with five citizens to talk about health care before giving a speech on the topic that received scant national attention.\u201d\u00a0And the former vice president has acknowledged the extent to which his low visibility is helping him.AD\u201cThe more that Donald Trump is out the worse he does. I think it is wonderful that he goes out,\u201d Biden quipped at a virtual event over the weekend. \u201cI\u2019m being a bit facetious because it is dangerous what he is doing at his rallies. But look at it: His numbers have dropped through the floor.\u201dADThe big question remaining is whether the broad coalition of voters Biden needs to win will demand more specificity and a higher profile on key issues from him in the months ahead. \n  \n  \n  You are reading the Power Up newsletter. \n  Not a regular subscriber? \n   \n   \n    \n   \n   \n  \n \nAt the PentagonCLINT LORANCE GOT A PARDON, BUT HIS UNIT CAN'T SHED HIS PAST: \u201cLorance had been in charge of his platoon for only three days when he ordered his men to kill three Afghans stopped on a dirt road. A second-degree murder conviction and pardon followed. Today, Lorance is hailed as a hero by [Trump]. His troops have suffered a very different fate,\u201d our colleague Greg Jaffe reports this morning in a special report on \u201cThe Cursed Platoon\u201d Lorance left behind.ADWhile in command, Lorance averaged a war crime a day, a military jury found: \u201cOn his last day before he was dismissed, he ordered his troops to open fire on three Afghan men standing by a motorcycle on the side of the road who he said posed a threat,\u201d our colleague writes. \u201cHis actions led to a 19-year prison sentence.\u201dADBut now Lorance has a book deal and has joined Trump onstage at a rally: \u201cFor the men of 1st platoon, part of the 82nd Airborne Division, the costs of the war and the fallout from the case have been profound and sometimes deadly,\u201d our colleague writes.Since returning home in 2013, five of the platoon\u2019s three dozen soldiers have died: \u201cAt least four others have been hospitalized following suicide attempts or struggles with drugs or alcohol. The last fatality came a few weeks before Lorance was pardoned when James O. Twist, 27, a Michigan state trooper and father of three, died of suicide.\u201dOutside the BeltwayCORONAVIRUS CASES ARE CLIMBING: For the first time since the pandemic began, U.S. cases topped 50,000 a day at a huge 52,780. The awful new numbers come as Americans plan to celebrate July Fourth weekend, and many states and governors are urging them to stay away from celebrations outside their homes while rolling back reopening plans in key states.ADCalifornia, Texas, Arizona, North Carolina and Georgia all broke their previous records for cases in a single day.\u00a0States that reopened first are the ones with the most cases.Yet Trump said this to Fox Business yesterday: \u201cI think we\u2019re going to be very good with the coronavirus,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI think that, at some point, that\u2019s going to sort of disappear, I hope.\u201d He added he was \u201call for mask\u201d and would himself wear one \u2014 something he's steadfastly declined to do publicly \u2014 \u201cin a tight situation with people.\u201dICYMI, Vanilla Ice plans to hold a 2,500 concert this weekend in Austin, Texas. Yep.Tulsa rally is still reverberating throughout Trump campaign: \u201cIn the past two weeks, the campaign has contended with waves of fallout from the rally, where the president put on a pugilistic performance before an arena that was only partly filled,\u201d Josh Dawsey and Carol D. Leonnig report.ADThe fallout began before the event even started: \u201cIt was just hours before [Trump] was set to take the stage for his rally in Tulsa last month when the news broke: Six staff at the site had just tested positive for the coronavirus,\u201d our colleagues write. \u201cThe president, who was en route from Washington, was livid that the news was public, according to people familiar with his reaction.\u201dSome top aides like campaign manager Brad Parscale have self-quarantined: The hope had been the rally would signal a return to normal for the campaign. \u201cBut some advisers now see the rally as ill-advised, an event that created a cascade of problems that have challenged the campaign and its staff. Campaign officials had previously said they were planning more large rallies, but the Tulsa event has led to increased concerns and debates on how \u2014 and whether \u2014 they can be pulled off. \u201dAt The White HouseNO RESPONSE TO RUSSIAN BOUNTIES PLANNED: \u201cThe White House is not planning an immediate response to intelligence reports of Russian bounties given to Taliban-linked militants to kill U.S. and coalition forces in Afghanistan because [Trump] does not believe the reports are true or \u2018actionable,\u2019 according to two senior administration officials,\u201d Ellen Nakashima, Josh Dawsey, Karen DeYoung and Shane Harris report.ADADThe debate inside the White House: \u201cOne administration official said there is an internal White House dispute about how much information to declassify to support the president\u2019s skepticism of the intelligence. Some of Trump\u2019s own senior intelligence officials viewed the information as credible enough to warn the Pentagon and allies so they could ensure they had measures in place to protect their forces in Afghanistan, and to begin developing options for responding to the Russian operation, national security adviser Robert C. O\u2019Brien said.\u201dRussia appears to be increasingly emboldened: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t require a top-secret clearance and access to the government\u2019s most classified information to see that the list of Russian aggressions in recent weeks rivals some of the worst days of the Cold War,\u201d the New York Times's David E. Sanger and Eric Schmitt report.A recap of what's happened: \u201cThere have been new cyberattacks on Americans working from home to exploit vulnerabilities in their corporate systems and continued concern about new playbooks for Russian actors seeking to influence the November election. Off the coast of Alaska, Russian jets have been testing American air defenses, sending U.S. warplanes scrambling to intercept them.\u201dBut for now there's no response: \u201cYet missing from all this is a strategy for pushing back \u2014 old-fashioned deterrence, to pluck a phrase from the depths of the Cold War \u2014 that could be employed from Afghanistan to Ukraine, from the deserts of Libya to the vulnerable voter registration rolls in battleground states.\u201d\u00a0ViralTHREE GRAPHICS TO UNDERSTAND COVID:THE NEW HIGH: \u201cNewly reported cases across the United States on Wednesday catapulted to a new high \u2014 52,788 in all \u2014 as individual states continued to topple their own grim records. Hospitalizations and deaths also continued to surge in some areas amid scattered reopening efforts,\u201d Michael Brice-Saddler and Jacqueline Dupree report.ADThe surge has been led by states that reopened first as infections rose 50 percent in June: \u201cStates that took an aggressive approach to reopening led the country in infection spikes \u2014 along with California, the nation\u2019s most populous state, where leaders have been more cautious. California reported 110 new deaths, more than any other state,\u201d Anne Gearan, Derek Hawkins and Siobh\u00e1n O'Grady report.The pandemic is exacerbating an existing health crisis: \u201cNationwide, federal and local officials are reporting alarming spikes in drug overdoses \u2014 a hidden epidemic within the pandemic. Emerging evidence suggests that the continued isolation, economic devastation and disruptions to the drug trade in recent months are fueling the surge,\u201d William Wan and Heather Long report.The grim reality: \u201cData obtained by The Washington Post from a real-time tracker of drug-related emergency calls and interviews with coroners suggest that overdoses have not just increased since the pandemic began but are accelerating as it persists.\u201d\u00a0This level of global economic devastation hasn't been seen since WWII: \u201cThe global economy is suffering its deepest recession since World War II, according to the World Bank, with most countries experiencing downturns at one time since 1870. It\u2019s the fourth deepest recession in the last 150 years, twice as deep as the Great Recession of the late 2000s,\u201d Anthony Faiola reports.Poverty is projected to skyrocket: \u201cUp to 100 million people globally are poised to fall into extreme poverty, the first increase since the Asian and Latin America financial crises of the 1990s, and the biggest increase since the World Bank began tracking the number in 1990.\u201d\u00a0In the MediaWHAT ELSE YOU NEED TO KNOW:Biden continues to outraise Trump: \u201cAs the presidential campaigns gear up in earnest for the general election, supporters are contributing in massive amounts to support the two presumptive candidates, with [Biden] outraising [Trump] by $10 million in June, according to new figures,\u201d Michelle Ye Hee Lee and Annie Linskey report. \u201cThat means Biden outraised Trump for the second month in a row.\u201dThe president is set to host a private high-dollar fundraiser in Florida next week: \u201cThe invitation does not name the owner of the home hosting the $580,600-per-couple event. Campaign manager Brad Parscale, RNC chairwoman Ronna McDaniel and other senior RNC fundraisers are listed as hosts of the event,\u201d Josh Dawsey and Michelle Ye Hee Lee report.Mary Trump's book is back on: \u201cA New York court lifted a temporary restraining order against the publication of a book by President Trump\u2019s niece, enabling publisher Simon & Schuster to continue printing and distributing the explosive insider account by Mary L.

Having resulted in at least one American death, and maybe more, these Russian bounties reportedly produced the desired outcome. While deeply disturbing, this effort by Putin is not surprising: It follows a clear pattern of ignoring international norms, rules and laws \u2014 and daring the United States to do anything about it. Putin sees the United States as his central enemy. He fears our democratic values; believes that we actively promote these values to undermine autocrats, including himself; and loathes the liberal international order, which, in his view, serves American hegemony and weakens Russia. This latest act is designed to keep the United States bogged down in Afghanistan.More alarming is President Trump's response: Nothing. This, too, follows a pattern of fealty before Putin, as the president has consistently praised Putin, dismissed Russia's meddling in the 2016 election, never criticized Russian annexation of Crimea, and uttered not a word about violations of human rights and growing autocracy in Russia. Trump's embrace of Putin, despite the clear costs to U.S. national security, has tightened. But this latest moment of indifference \u2014 silence about the killing of American soldiers \u2014 marks a new low.Support our journalism. Subscribe today.arrow-rightWe now know what to expect of Putin, whose litany of belligerent acts is long and increasingly audacious. In 2008, he invaded the republic of Georgia and then recognized its territories of Abkhazia and South Ossetia as independent states, an obvious and violent attack on international law. In 2014, he violated Ukrainian sovereignty by annexing Crimea, defying one of the most sacred rules of the international order since the end of World War II. After the annexation, Putin armed (and at times supported with his own soldiers) separatist movements in eastern Ukraine, resulting in more than 13,000 deaths and roughly 2 million displaced citizens; these rebels also used a Russian rocket to shoot down Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17 over Ukraine, killing all 298 people on board. In 2015, Putin deployed the Russian air force to Syria to prop up a ruthless dictator; his pilots committed war crimes when bombing Syrian civilians indiscriminately, according to the United Nations.The smear that killed the U.S.-Russia \u2018reset\u2019In 2016, Putin violated American sovereignty, trying in several ways to influence the outcome of our presidential election. The same year, Russian intelligence agents allegedly sought to orchestrate a coup in Montenegro just as the country was preparing to join NATO. In 2018, Putin attempted to assassinate an apostate intelligence officer, Sergei Skripal, in Britain, using a toxin easily traced back to Russia. Then in 2019, his agents allegedly killed Zelimkhan Khangoshvili,  a Chechen Georgian citizen, in Berlin, where he had sought asylum after previous attempts on his life. And now in 2020, American intelligence officials revealed that Putin has offered Taliban fighters bounties to kill U.S. soldiers in Afghanistan.ADADTragically, Trump's feeble response to these atrocities has followed an equally consistent pattern. His administration has tried to implement appropriate policy responses to contain and punish the Putin regime \u2014 measures Trump himself has sought to weaken. The administration rightly provided lethal military assistance to Ukraine. But Trump undermined the benefits of that policy by asking his friend and lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, to try to condition receipt of this military aid on nonexistent dirt that Ukraine's government might dig up on former vice president Joe Biden. The administration rightly provided new resources and soldiers for NATO. But Trump has weakened NATO unity and readiness by berating allied leaders, German Chancellor Angela Merkel in particular, and constantly treating the alliance as a protection racket. Trump reportedly participated in no interagency process before deciding alone to cut the number of U.S. soldiers in Germany. And he ordered substantial reductions in American forces in Syria, another present for Putin, without even telling his defense secretary, Jim Mattis. (Putin won the added benefit of Mattis's resignation in 2018 over the matter.)In return for all of these gifts to Putin, Trump has received nothing. The president's exuberant fidelity to the Russian autocrat has produced no positive outcomes for U.S. national interests \u2014 no new arms-control treaty, no help in dealing with worsening relations with Iran, no assistance in fighting the Taliban, no withdrawal of Russian forces from Ukraine, no freeing from a Moscow jail of wrongly imprisoned American Paul Whelan and no amazing trade deals.Putin wanted to interrogate me. Trump called it \u2018an incredible offer.\u2019 Why?Meanwhile, Trump has consistently tried to befriend Putin, even when it was considered politically unwise to do so and when nearly his entire administration opposed this approach. Most shockingly, Trump stood next to Putin during a news conference after their summit in Helsinki in the summer of 2018 and told the world that he agreed with the Russian president, and disagreed with his own intelligence community and the Muller investigation, in believing that Russia did not interfere in the 2016 presidential election. Even on small issues of little relevance to American national interests, Trump has sided with Putin's propaganda, including defending\u00a0the Soviet Union's 1979 invasion of Afghanistan and suggesting that Montenegro might trigger World War III.ADADEqually disturbing, Trump's alibi for his lack of a response to the apparent Russian-ordered contract killing of American soldiers in Afghanistan is incompetence. The Washington Post Fact Checker staff has documented more than 19,000 falsehoods uttered by Trump as of June. But for the sake of argument, let's assume that Trump was not orally briefed about this intelligence. That in itself is a damning indictment of the president and his national security team. National security adviser Robert O'Brien receives the Presidential Daily Brief, as do other senior national security officials. Why did none of them tell Trump about this intelligence since the White House learned of it last year, especially before he called Putin a half-dozen times, invited him back to the Group of Seven or announced American troop reductions in Germany? During my five years in the Obama administration, the president reviewed relevant intelligence before calling any head of state or undertaking any major foreign policy decision. That process does not appear to be functioning in the Trump administration.There is still much to learn about this latest instance of Russian belligerence. National Security Council spokesman John Ullyot said that \"the veracity of the allegations continue to be evaluated,\" and the White House press secretary claimed that the intelligence community was not unified about this finding. But officials have also told reporters that the matter appeared in the Presidential Daily Brief months ago, on Feb. 27. In my three years of working at the National Security Council in the Obama administration, only the most serious intelligence findings appeared in that most precious of intelligence products. Hopefully, Congress will use its oversight powers to get to the bottom of this.The Clinton campaign warned you about Russia. But nobody listened to us.But even if Trump just learned about the bounties, he has still not said what he will do about them. Instead, he has denounced the reporting on this intelligence as \"Just another HOAX,\" again defending Putin instead of siding with U.S. intelligence officials and our soldiers. It's no wonder Putin thought he could order the killing of American soldiers and face no serious consequences.ADADTrump isn't going to change the way he acts toward Russia; he's too invested in his personalized approach to diplomacy and his shambolic decision-making process. But imagine what four more years of this might mean for our troops abroad, our allies or our national security generally. It's not hard to picture Trump traveling to Moscow to watch the annual May 9 military parade and celebrating the end of the Great Patriotic War with his friend Putin; or lifting sanctions on Russia and abandoning Ukraine; or trying to pull the United States out of NATO. Trump's weak response to the bounty revelations is a warning of worse things to come.\nTwitter: @McFaul\nRead more from Outlook:The \u2018collusion\u2019 narrative is doing the Russians\u2019 dirty work for themTrump Jr.\u2019s Russia meeting sure sounds like a Russian intelligence operationWhat it\u2019s like to be expelled from Russia with your toddler and dogFollow our updates on Facebook and ", "comment": "3.8k Comments", "topic": "Outlook"}, {"cover": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/A3LZKWF4VYI6VF6BNTYRN77CNQ.jpghttps://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/A3LZKWF4VYI6VF6BNTYRN77CNQ.jpg", "title": "The one thing that matters in Republican primaries", "date": "Jul 2, 2020", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/the-one-thing-that-matters-in-republican-primaries/2020/07/02/61241196-42ee-4d4c-a986-671bb272cc6a_story.html", "keyword": "presidential election and trade war", "website": "the Washington Post", "author": "David Weigel", "content": "In this edition: Why Republicans didn't fret about a QAnon-curious candidate's win in Colorado, how Trump-friendly media hunts for Biden gaffes, and what changed after Tuesday's primaries.I'm glad that, finally, those of us who live in cities will get to hear some fireworks this weekend, and this is The Trailer.

He spent 10 years in Congress without a hint of scandal. He helped bring the Bureau of Land Management to Colorado\u2019s western slope, the sort of economic coup that usually secures reelection. And he got an endorsement from the president, branding him a \u201cgreat supporter of the #MAGA Agenda!\u201dADBut Tipton\u2019s congressional career is over, after his defeat Tuesday by gun rights activist and gun-themed restaurant owner Lauren Boebert. The first-time candidate, who spent less than $120,000 on her race, unseated Tipton on the premise that the co-chair of President Trump\u2019s Colorado campaign was not sufficiently pro-Trump and not doing enough to win the cultural war against the president.AD\u201cIf AOC can be one person and direct the narrative for an entire nation, then doggone, so can I,\u201d she told the Denver Post last year, referring to Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.). \u201cI am ready to stand up and change that narrative back to good.\u201dBoebert's win was the latest proof, if more was needed, of just how strongly the president has redefined the Republican Party and its priorities. While distraught ex-Republicans run ads against him, and while rumors swirl about how endangered senators will separate their campaigns from his, loyalty to the president is, more than ever, the determinant of whether a Republican can win a primary.\u00a0ADBoebert's well-known flirtation with the QAnon conspiracy theory, in which Trump is secretly at war against a murderous \u201cdeep state,\u201d did not hurt her campaign or even draw a rebuke from national Republicans. Even as the president's poll numbers slip, there is no way for a Republican candidate to be too close to the president. Footage and quotes from Republicans who criticized Trump before his presidency, even when they criticized him from the right, is the most combustible material any campaign can use against them. And because so many Republicans criticized the future president at so many moments, there's plenty of it to go around.\u00a0ADLoyalty to Trump has shaped this primary season \u2015 there are still three months to go \u2014 more than any other issue. According to data provided by Advertising Analytics, the president has been featured in 339 ads run by Republicans or affiliated PACs in this year\u2019s primaries. Just five Republican ads have mentioned Democratic nominee Joe Biden, largely as an afterthought, or a stand-in for the left-wing forces that want to defeat the president. In this week's Oklahoma primaries, for example, the Club for Growth's PAC blistered state legislator Stephanie Bice because she had endorsed Carly Fiorina for president in 2016.\u201cThe candidate Bice backed called for President Trump to be impeached,\u201d the ad says. \u201cAnd now the candidate Bice backed says she's going to vote for Joe Biden, not Donald Trump.\u201d Commercials like that helped to force an August runoff, with Bice, who outspent a field of less-experienced candidates, taking just 25 percent of Tuesday's vote \u2014 even as her own ads accused the D.C.-based Club for Growth of attacking her \u201cbecause Bice stands with President Trump.\u201dADIn an interview, Club for Growth President David McIntosh explained that no issue moved Republican votes like support for the president. The group's polling, he said, found a 15- to 20-point bump for candidates who were endorsed by Trump and found that having opposed the president was \u201cone of the top three negatives\u201d in any race. (Three Republicans have lost renomination despite endorsements from Trump, though all lost to more conservative candidates.) The group's endorsements were based on candidates' records on taxes and spending, and the ads got into that. But the hook, frequently, was the president \u2014 an irony for an organization that had spent millions in 2016 to stop Trump in the primary.AD\u201cIn my old district, there was a guy who led in the polls because he'd been elected countywide prosecutor, Carl Brizzi,\u201d said McIntosh, a former Indiana congressman. \u201cHe was claiming to be pro-Trump, but there were these video documents of him on a radio show just trashing Trump. When we ran that ad, it completely flipped the numbers.\u201d Brizzi wound up with less than 6 percent of the vote, as a pro-Trump state legislator triumphed.Trump loyalty has been a defining Republican issue for most of this presidency. Before it was used against former attorney general Jeff Sessions in this year's U.S. Senate primary in Alabama, it was deployed in the 2017 race for his open seat. Rep. Mo Brooks, who like Tipton came into office during the 2010 tea party wave, was pilloried for criticizing Trump during the 2016 primary. Like many of the Republicans subjected to this treatment, Brooks had opposed Trump from the right \u2014 he supported Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas \u2014 only to see his skepticism that Trump was a reliable conservative turned into faithlessness toward a Republican president.ADThat pattern has continued into this year. In Alabama, where several House primaries will be decided by runoffs this month, Republican Jerry Carl has attacked rival Bill Hightower over a retweet of conservative columnist Quin Hillyer in which Hillyer said he was \u201cdisgusted\u201d with both parties' 2016 nominees. \u201cHightower is trying to disguise his disgust for President Trump,\u201d one ad warns. In recent New Mexico and Kentucky primaries, candidates volleyed back and forth accusing each other of being critical of the president, splattering the screen with old Facebook posts or retweets.ADActual \u201cNever Trump\u201d Republicans are hard to find in this year's primaries; most Trump-related ads focus on the candidate's own unshakable support for the president. In Oklahoma, Rep. Markwayne Mullin fended off gadfly challengers by emphasizing how he fought \u201cPelosi's impeachment sham.\u201d In South Carolina, a PAC accused state Rep. Nancy Mace of \u201cabandoning Trump before the showdown with Crooked Hillary,\u201d a reference to criticism of Trump in 2016; Mace fought back with a Trump endorsement and multiple promises to \u201chelp President Trump take care of our veterans.\u201d (She won her primary.)\u00a0When viewed together, the pro-Trump ads and messaging have a theme bigger than support for the president. It's that the president is under siege, that even some in his party do not defend him strongly enough, and that other Republicans do not understand why it's so important to do so.ADThe sudden popularity of the QAnon theory is in sync with that messaging. As with many conspiracy theories, its adherents hold a range of opinions. Some \u201c9/11 truthers\u201d believed that the government was covering up something up about the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attack; some believed that no planes actually struck the World Trade Center or the Pentagon. Similarly, the supporters of whoever is posting on message boards as \u201cQ,\u201d claiming to be a government operative with details of how Trump will arrest his enemies, range from people who believe that bureaucrats are working to undermine the president to people who believe that coronavirus stay-at-home restrictions were biding time for government agents to free \u201cmole children\u201d from underground tunnels.ADTen Republican candidates have, so far, advanced to runoffs or won their nominations while expressing some support for QAnon theories. (None responded to interview requests this week.) They have generally, Boebert included, kept their endorsements of the theories as generic as possible. In a May interview with online host Ann Vandersteel, Boebert talked about QAnon only when prompted and dealt with none of the theory's specifics.\u201cThat's more my mom's thing; she's a little fringe,\u201d Boebert said. \u201cEverything that I\u2019ve heard of Q, I hope that this is real, because it only means that America is getting stronger and better, and people are returning to conservative values. And that's what I am for.\u201dADThat was enough for Democrats to attack Boebert, the first nominee to speak positively about the conspiracy theory and win a nomination in a Republican-friendly district. Georgia's Q-curious Marjorie Taylor Greene was denounced by the party, after a Politico investigation found her making a series of racist statements. She faces a runoff election Aug. 11. But Republicans stood by Boebert, accusing Democrats of peddling \u201ctheir radical conspiracy theories and pushing their radical cancel culture,\u201d without tackling the substance of the attack.ADThe mention of \u201ccancel culture,\u201d a pejorative term for demands that offensive or outdated thoughts be removed from public life, captured Boebert's place in the movement and the reason for that QAnon interview.\u00a0Boebert did not win because of one online interview. She became well known in the district for being on the conservatives' side of culture wars. She opened a restaurant with gun-themed food where waiters and diners were encouraged to carry firearms. She confronted Beto O'Rourke, during the waning days of his presidential campaign, over his idea of mandatory gun buybacks. And she opened her restaurant during the state's stay-at-home orders, putting the restaurant's license at risk and making her one of the biggest news stories on the western slope.AD\u201cI don't see anyone else taking these people on,\u201d Boebert explained in that same interview with Vandersteel. \u201cWe want someone who is going to disrupt the narrative and bring attention to what matters to us.\u201dADAnu Narayanswamy contributed reporting.Reading list\u201cTrump supporters hope to use conservative anger at Chief Justice Roberts to energize troubled campaign,\u201d by Robert CostaHow some losses in the courts are being spun for partisan consumption.\u201cA warning for Democrats: Handling the economy is Trump's last remaining bright spot,\u201d by Peter HambyWhat a super PAC's focus group says about the race.\u201cTrump set to headline high-dollar fundraising dinner at a private Florida home next week,\u201d by Josh Dawsey and Michelle Ye Hee LeeADThe race for cash continues as the White House looks past the pandemic.\u201cTrolling Trump, the Lincoln Project also peddles militarism,\u201d by Jeet HeerA left-wing worry about Joe Biden's new Republican support.\u201cIn wake of Trump\u2019s Tulsa rally, his campaign is still contending with the fallout,\u201d by Josh Dawsey and Carol D.

After nearly three months of goading by Republicans, who pointed out Biden's avoidance of media questions, the Democratic candidate didn't make anything easily construed as a gaffe.But the reaction to Biden's Wilmington, Del., event from the Trump campaign and Fox News provided a lesson in epistemic closure, and how in Trump-friendly media, Biden is constantly on the verge of collapse. In the 24 hours after the news conference, a voter who learned about it from the Trump campaign and Fox News might think Biden gave a dangerously incoherent performance and that the media covered it up \u2014 though the event was carried live on TV.\u201cIt was pretty hard to watch, the digressions, the stammering, the confusion all on display,\u201d Fox News's Sean Hannity told viewers Tuesday night.Fox's prime time programming covered the Biden event as a debacle, focusing on moments when the Democratic nominee paused or restarted a sentence, which happened a few times over the course of an hour.\u00a0As in most other media, the most talked-about question was the one asked by Fox News reporter Doug McKelway: \u201cHave you been tested for some degree of cognitive decline?\u201d On Fox, the question hardly needed an answer; conservative TV anchor Raymond Arroyo told Fox's Laura Ingraham that \u201cpeople who watched this, and I spoke to Democrats and Republicans, they felt really bad watching Biden.\u201dThe Trump campaign got three short videos out of the news conference. One compiled moments when Biden paused, draining the color from the clips and labeling them part of a \u201csilent movie.\u201d Another played Marvin Gaye's \u201cLet's Get It On\u201d over clips of reporters asking questions about the campaign or the president. And another focused on Biden's remarks about the \u201clist\u201d of reporters there to insist that Biden's \u201chandlers are afraid of him going off script.\u201dThat theme continued all day Wednesday. Rudolph W. Giuliani, who is 18 months younger than Biden, told reporters at the White House that the media was covering up the decline in what he mistakenly called Biden's \u201cinterview.\u201d\u201cHe took long pauses in answering questions, and he had a teleprompter,\u201d Giuliani said. \u201cHe's having trouble reading, not just thinking.\u201dThe president's middle son, Eric, had taken another direction, saying on Fox News that the shame of the news conference was that Biden did not get the same sort of questions that his opponent did.\u201cMy father's getting shouted at by crazy Jim Acosta every single day,\u201d Trump said. \u201cHe's literally getting lambasted by these people, and you see these little softballs, where Joe Biden's going through this list.\u201dThe president himself cohered both arguments into one tweet, falsely accusing Biden of colluding with reporters on the questions and answers. \u201cHe read the answers from a teleprompter,\u201d Trump tweeted. But while Biden read from a short speech on the teleprompter, and while he had a list identifying which reporters were in the room, he had no heads up on the questions, and no script for the answers.Portraying Biden as a \u201cdeclining,\u201d incoherent bumbler is central to the Trump reelection message. When Biden doesn't stumble memorably, the president's reelection machine is ready for that, too, making a supercut of moments when he searched for words. The looming question: whether this technique would work for an event, such as debates or a convention speech, likely to be viewed in real time by millions of people.Ad watchJoe Biden, \u201cCacerolazo.\u201d A spot designed exclusively for the Miami media market, this drew outrage from some of the online left, with accusations that the Democrat was running against Black Lives Matter. But protesters appear in the ad in the context of being suppressed by police, on orders of the president. The thrust of the ad is that Trump is behaving like an authoritarian thug, with Spanish-speaking viewers in Miami prodded to compare him to Cuba's Castros and Venezuela's Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.Mitch McConnell, \u201cDefeat the Mob.\u201d One of two new McConnell spots that focus on the protests that unfolded across the country last month, this features the Senate majority leader speaking straight to the camera, unloading on how \u201cthe mobs have come for our founders and our heroes.\u201d There's a mention of Seattle's anarchic free zone, which was shut down as the ad began running, and even a mention of the Lenin statue that stands in that city. \u201cWhen the dust settles, it is never the mobs or the looters who we honor,\u201d McConnell says.CFG Action, \u201cGame Time.\u201d The Club for Growth is helping former Auburn University football coach Tommy Tuberville in his Senate primary runoff with former attorney general Jeff Sessions. Like much recent Club output, the focus is on Trump, and specifically on how Tuberville will be an ally of the president while Sessions recused himself from the Russia probe. \u201cAlabama wants winners, not recusers,\u201d says a narrator.Doug Jones, \u201cFor Each Other.\u201d The senator waiting for either Tuberville or Sessions at the end of their primary continues to run ads that offer no red meat whatsoever, portraying him as an ideology-free politician who is concerned about public safety during the pandemic. \u201cIn Alabama, we do this for each other,\u201d Jones says, pulling on a mask after emphasizing that the end of the pandemic would allow businesses to reopen. \n  \n  \n  You are reading The Trailer, the newsletter that brings the campaign trail to your inbox.  \n   \n   \n    \n   \n   \n  \n \nPoll watchWhat's the likelihood you might vote for this candidate? (Monmouth, 733 registered voters)Donald TrumpCertain: 34%Not at all: 50%Joe BidenCertain: 40%Not at all: 39%This monthly poll has found Biden with a lead all year, growing every month, though the 12-point lead this time isn't very different from the previous, 11-point Biden lead. But Monmouth is finding an intensity gap that cuts against the main argument being made by Trump allies recently: that the president, unlike Biden, has an enthusiastic support base. While more support for Trump is positive (for him) and more support for Biden is negative (against Trump), far more voters are considering Biden, and slightly more Biden voters are firm in their support. When Monmouth gave voters a generic third-party option, Biden's lead stayed at 12 points. When the Green and Libertarian nominees were added, by name, Biden's lead stretched slightly to 13 points, and Trump's support fell to 39 percent.Money watchFor the second month running, Joe Biden and his coordinated campaign out-fundraised the president and the Republican National Committee. Biden and the DNC announced Wednesday that they'd raised $141 million in the month of June; Trumpworld had announced, a few hours earlier, a $131 million haul. On Twitter, a giddy Biden campaign spent the evening mocking Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale, who'd celebrated the smaller GOP number by tweeting that Americans were \u201cvoting with their wallets.\u201dBiden's campaign did not reveal its cash on hand, which was almost certainly lower than the Trump campaign's. Even after spending $100 million in June, an period that saw the president's disappointing return to the campaign trail and a series of anti-Biden ad buys, the president's reelection effort had $295 million left to spend. As of May 31, the last date we have information for, Biden had a bit more than $82 million in the bank.Something we don't yet know, and won't until the FEC publishes full candidate filings, is whether Biden's under-the-radar campaign is slowing down his burn rate. The president held two big in-person fundraisers last month, and the aforementioned Tulsa rally; Biden's travel and rental expenses never got much bigger than a flight and a high school gym. While the Biden campaign made a $15 million ad buy in June, the Trump campaign spent a bit more. And the most vital aspect of the Trump campaign's cash advantage has been its years-long volunteer training program, something Biden has no choice but to catch up to.Still, Biden has quickly evolved from a laggard fundraiser with a high burn rate to a candidate who can break Democratic Party fundraising records. According to the campaign, 2.6 million of its June donors had not given before. Even without the use of Bernie Sanders's donor list, the Democratic nominee is now outmatching Trump. That's no guarantee of victory, and not long ago, Mitt Romney repeatedly outraised President Barack Obama on his way to losing the 2012 election. But if you were watching fundraising numbers before, and noticed that the combined totals for Democrats outpaced donations to Trump, you can see how Biden consolidated a free-spending donor base.In the statesTuesday's elections produced a new Republican star in Colorado, but they also ended one of the Democrats' most divisive primaries and expanded Medicaid in a deep red state that had resisted the policy for a decade.In Colorado, former governor John Hickenlooper easily defeated former state House speaker Andrew Romanoff, after a stretch of bad news that raised questions about Hickenlooper's electability. Ballots were sent to voters the very day that Hickenlooper blew off a state ethics commission meeting; ballots were being returned by the time Hickenlooper paid back $2,750 for travel gifts uncovered by a Republican group.It was not enough to help Romanoff, who has now lost his third election in 10 years. Romanoff, who had moved to the left since his days as a legislator, defeated Hickenlooper at the party's activist-heavy convention and argued that the ethics fine made him less electable against Sen. Cory Gardner. But at best, the scandal reduced Hickenlooper's expected landslide to a slightly smaller landslide. By Thursday, after 96 percent of ballots had been counted, Hickenlooper led by 18 points and had carried all but one county \u2014 rural Saguache, where fewer than 2,000 votes were cast.When the count is over, more than 1 million ballots are likely to have been cast in the primary. While only recently have independents been allowed to vote in Colorado's Democratic contests, that's going to set a record. In 2010, when only Democrats could vote in the primary, Romanoff lost a challenge to Sen. Michael F. Bennet in a race where just 338,186 votes were cast. This week, Romanoff got tens of thousands of more votes than that, only to lose so decisively that he endorsed Hickenlooper within an hour of polls closing.Turnout was markedly higher for both parties across all races compared with 2018. More than 200,000 votes were cast in the Democratic and Republican primaries for the aforementioned 3rd District, with Republican turnout slightly edging out Democrats. (Republicans had no statewide race to turn out for.) Dianne Mitsch Bush, the former state legislator who lost the district's 2018 race for Democrats, easily defeated a more moderate but less-known candidate.In Oklahoma, pro-Medicaid-expansion campaigners overcame the challenges of a summer election, picked by state leaders because turnout would have been higher in November, and passed State Question 802 by just one point, a margin of fewer than 7,000 votes. By all evidence, the negative campaigning made a dent. Early votes broke by a 3-to-1 margin in favor of the measure, but Election Day and later absentee votes broke against it.What moved numbers? The campaign by the Oklahoma Council of Public Affairs, which deluged the state with ads, labeled the measure a \u201ctakeover\u201d that would empower left-wing Democrats to run Oklahomans' health care. Its ads targeted four well-known Democratic Party figures: Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Nancy Pelosi and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. (Tellingly, the ads did not bother with Joe Biden.) That moved partisan Republican support, though not enough to sink the measure, in a state where the president won 65 percent of the vote.Down the ballot, Republicans set up an August runoff between state Sen. Stephanie Bice and previously unsuccessful candidate Terry Neese. The winner will face Democratic Rep. Kendra Horn in one of several 2020 races where a seat once held by a male Republican will be held, no matter the result, by a woman. In a small irony, ads against Bice focused on her support for 2016 presidential candidate Carly Fiorina, who has become a critic of the president. Neese served as Fiorina's co-chair in Oklahoma.In Utah, while the GOP gubernatorial primary was too close to call, former NFL player Burgess Owens fended off three rivals to win the nomination in 4th Congressional District. He's the second black Republican to win the nomination in the seat, which was held for two terms by Mia Love. And he was helped by frequent appearances on Fox News, which gave him more earned media than state legislator Kim Coleman, who was backed by Sen. Mike Lee. Owens will face Rep. Ben McAdams, who narrowly beat Love in 2018, but he ended the primary with just over $110,000 cash on hand, to $2.2 million for McAdams.Candidate trackerThe final campaign day before the holiday weekend was dominated by the June jobs numbers, which found 4.5 million people returning to the workforce despite a slowdown at the end of the month. While the raw unemployment number, 11.1 percent, remained high, President Trump quickly scheduled a news conference to celebrate\u201cToday's announcement proves that our economy is roaring back,\u201d Trump said, adding that better news might come right when it would matter most for him politically. \u201cThe good thing is the numbers will be coming out right before the election.\u201dBut previous jobs numbers haven't done much to change the trajectory of the race. Last month, when the jobs report found 2.5 million people heading back to work, the president announced the start of the \u201cgreat American comeback,\u201d and made it the focus of his campaign. In the time since, his support has dipped slightly in an average of polls.Joe Biden responded later in the day, saying that the last weeks of June gave cause to worry about employment trends, as coronavirus infections rose and more businesses closed up.\u201cQuit hoping for the best, Mr. President,\u201d Biden said. \u201cQuit claiming victory with almost 15 million Americans still out of work because of this crisis. Quit ignoring the reality of this pandemic and the horrifying loss of American life.\u201d\u00a0Countdown\u2026 five days until primaries in Delaware and New Jersey\u2026 nine days until the Louisiana primary\u2026 12 days until runoffs in Alabama and Texas\u2026 46 days until the Democratic National Convention\u2026 54 days until the Republican National Convention\u2026 64 days until North Carolina begins sending out absentee ballots\u2026 124 days until the general election", "comment": "111 Comments", "topic": "Politics"}, {"cover": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/LXPGUEV3J4I6VF6BNTYRN77CNQ.jpghttps://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/LXPGUEV3J4I6VF6BNTYRN77CNQ.jpg", "title": "The Trailer: The one thing that matters in Republican primaries", "date": "Jul 2, 2020", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/paloma/the-trailer/2020/07/02/the-trailer-the-one-thing-that-matters-in-republican-primaries/5efcd3ea602ff108071936bc/", "keyword": "presidential election and trade war", "website": "the Washington Post", "author": "David Weigel", "content": "In this edition: Why Republicans didn't fret about a QAnon-curious candidate's win in Colorado, how Trump-friendly media hunts for Biden gaffes, and what changed after Tuesday's primaries.I'm glad that, finally, those of us who live in cities will get to hear some fireworks this weekend, and this is The Trailer.

He spent 10 years in Congress without a hint of scandal. He helped bring the Bureau of Land Management to Colorado\u2019s western slope, the sort of economic coup that usually secures reelection. And he got an endorsement from the president, branding him a \u201cgreat supporter of the #MAGA Agenda!\u201dADBut Tipton\u2019s congressional career is over, after his defeat Tuesday by gun rights activist and gun-themed restaurant owner Lauren Boebert. The first-time candidate, who spent less than $120,000 on her race, unseated Tipton on the premise that the co-chair of President Trump\u2019s Colorado campaign was not sufficiently pro-Trump and not doing enough to win the cultural war against the president.AD\u201cIf AOC can be one person and direct the narrative for an entire nation, then doggone, so can I,\u201d she told the Denver Post last year, referring to Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.). \u201cI am ready to stand up and change that narrative back to good.\u201dBoebert's win was the latest proof, if more was needed, of just how strongly the president has redefined the Republican Party and its priorities. While distraught ex-Republicans run ads against him, and while rumors swirl about how endangered senators will separate their campaigns from his, loyalty to the president is, more than ever, the determinant of whether a Republican can win a primary.\u00a0ADBoebert's well-known flirtation with the QAnon conspiracy theory, in which Trump is secretly at war against a murderous \u201cdeep state,\u201d did not hurt her campaign or even draw a rebuke from national Republicans. Even as the president's poll numbers slip, there is no way for a Republican candidate to be too close to the president. Footage and quotes from Republicans who criticized Trump before his presidency, even when they criticized him from the right, is the most combustible material any campaign can use against them. And because so many Republicans criticized the future president at so many moments, there's plenty of it to go around.\u00a0ADLoyalty to Trump has shaped this primary season \u2015 there are still three months to go \u2014 more than any other issue. According to data provided by Advertising Analytics, the president has been featured in 339 ads run by Republicans or affiliated PACs in this year\u2019s primaries. Just five Republican ads have mentioned Democratic nominee Joe Biden, largely as an afterthought, or a stand-in for the left-wing forces that want to defeat the president. In this week's Oklahoma primaries, for example, the Club for Growth's PAC blistered state legislator Stephanie Bice because she had endorsed Carly Fiorina for president in 2016.\u201cThe candidate Bice backed called for President Trump to be impeached,\u201d the ad says. \u201cAnd now the candidate Bice backed says she's going to vote for Joe Biden, not Donald Trump.\u201d Commercials like that helped to force an August runoff, with Bice, who outspent a field of less-experienced candidates, taking just 25 percent of Tuesday's vote \u2014 even as her own ads accused the D.C.-based Club for Growth of attacking her \u201cbecause Bice stands with President Trump.\u201dADIn an interview, Club for Growth President David McIntosh explained that no issue moved Republican votes like support for the president. The group's polling, he said, found a 15- to 20-point bump for candidates who were endorsed by Trump and found that having opposed the president was \u201cone of the top three negatives\u201d in any race. (Three Republicans have lost renomination despite endorsements from Trump, though all lost to more conservative candidates.) The group's endorsements were based on candidates' records on taxes and spending, and the ads got into that. But the hook, frequently, was the president \u2014 an irony for an organization that had spent millions in 2016 to stop Trump in the primary.AD\u201cIn my old district, there was a guy who led in the polls because he'd been elected countywide prosecutor, Carl Brizzi,\u201d said McIntosh, a former Indiana congressman. \u201cHe was claiming to be pro-Trump, but there were these video documents of him on a radio show just trashing Trump. When we ran that ad, it completely flipped the numbers.\u201d Brizzi wound up with less than 6 percent of the vote, as a pro-Trump state legislator triumphed.Trump loyalty has been a defining Republican issue for most of this presidency. Before it was used against former attorney general Jeff Sessions in this year's U.S. Senate primary in Alabama, it was deployed in the 2017 race for his open seat. Rep. Mo Brooks, who like Tipton came into office during the 2010 tea party wave, was pilloried for criticizing Trump during the 2016 primary. Like many of the Republicans subjected to this treatment, Brooks had opposed Trump from the right \u2014 he supported Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas \u2014 only to see his skepticism that Trump was a reliable conservative turned into faithlessness toward a Republican president.ADThat pattern has continued into this year. In Alabama, where several House primaries will be decided by runoffs this month, Republican Jerry Carl has attacked rival Bill Hightower over a retweet of conservative columnist Quin Hillyer in which Hillyer said he was \u201cdisgusted\u201d with both parties' 2016 nominees. \u201cHightower is trying to disguise his disgust for President Trump,\u201d one ad warns. In recent New Mexico and Kentucky primaries, candidates volleyed back and forth accusing each other of being critical of the president, splattering the screen with old Facebook posts or retweets.ADActual \u201cNever Trump\u201d Republicans are hard to find in this year's primaries; most Trump-related ads focus on the candidate's own unshakable support for the president. In Oklahoma, Rep. Markwayne Mullin fended off gadfly challengers by emphasizing how he fought \u201cPelosi's impeachment sham.\u201d In South Carolina, a PAC accused state Rep. Nancy Mace of \u201cabandoning Trump before the showdown with Crooked Hillary,\u201d a reference to criticism of Trump in 2016; Mace fought back with a Trump endorsement and multiple promises to \u201chelp President Trump take care of our veterans.\u201d (She won her primary.)\u00a0When viewed together, the pro-Trump ads and messaging have a theme bigger than support for the president. It's that the president is under siege, that even some in his party do not defend him strongly enough, and that other Republicans do not understand why it's so important to do so.ADThe sudden popularity of the QAnon theory is in sync with that messaging. As with many conspiracy theories, its adherents hold a range of opinions. Some \u201c9/11 truthers\u201d believed that the government was covering up something up about the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attack; some believed that no planes actually struck the World Trade Center or the Pentagon. Similarly, the supporters of whoever is posting on message boards as \u201cQ,\u201d claiming to be a government operative with details of how Trump will arrest his enemies, range from people who believe that bureaucrats are working to undermine the president to people who believe that coronavirus stay-at-home restrictions were biding time for government agents to free \u201cmole children\u201d from underground tunnels.ADTen Republican candidates have, so far, advanced to runoffs or won their nominations while expressing some support for QAnon theories. (None responded to interview requests this week.) They have generally, Boebert included, kept their endorsements of the theories as generic as possible. In a May interview with online host Ann Vandersteel, Boebert talked about QAnon only when prompted and dealt with none of the theory's specifics.\u201cThat's more my mom's thing; she's a little fringe,\u201d Boebert said. \u201cEverything that I\u2019ve heard of Q, I hope that this is real, because it only means that America is getting stronger and better, and people are returning to conservative values. And that's what I am for.\u201dADThat was enough for Democrats to attack Boebert, the first nominee to speak positively about the conspiracy theory and win a nomination in a Republican-friendly district. Georgia's Q-curious Marjorie Taylor Greene was denounced by the party, after a Politico investigation found her making a series of racist statements. She faces a runoff election Aug. 11. But Republicans stood by Boebert, accusing Democrats of peddling \u201ctheir radical conspiracy theories and pushing their radical cancel culture,\u201d without tackling the substance of the attack.ADThe mention of \u201ccancel culture,\u201d a pejorative term for demands that offensive or outdated thoughts be removed from public life, captured Boebert's place in the movement and the reason for that QAnon interview.\u00a0Boebert did not win because of one online interview. She became well known in the district for being on the conservatives' side of culture wars. She opened a restaurant with gun-themed food where waiters and diners were encouraged to carry firearms. She confronted Beto O'Rourke, during the waning days of his presidential campaign, over his idea of mandatory gun buybacks. And she opened her restaurant during the state's stay-at-home orders, putting the restaurant's license at risk and making her one of the biggest news stories on the western slope.AD\u201cI don't see anyone else taking these people on,\u201d Boebert explained in that same interview with Vandersteel. \u201cWe want someone who is going to disrupt the narrative and bring attention to what matters to us.\u201dADAnu Narayanswamy contributed reporting.Reading list\u201cTrump supporters hope to use conservative anger at Chief Justice Roberts to energize troubled campaign,\u201d by Robert CostaHow some losses in the courts are being spun for partisan consumption.\u201cA warning for Democrats: Handling the economy is Trump's last remaining bright spot,\u201d by Peter HambyWhat a super PAC's focus group says about the race.\u201cTrump set to headline high-dollar fundraising dinner at a private Florida home next week,\u201d by Josh Dawsey and Michelle Ye Hee LeeADThe race for cash continues as the White House looks past the pandemic.\u201cTrolling Trump, the Lincoln Project also peddles militarism,\u201d by Jeet HeerA left-wing worry about Joe Biden's new Republican support.\u201cIn wake of Trump\u2019s Tulsa rally, his campaign is still contending with the fallout,\u201d by Josh Dawsey and Carol D.

After nearly three months of goading by Republicans, who pointed out Biden's avoidance of media questions, the Democratic candidate didn't make anything easily construed as a gaffe.But the reaction to Biden's Wilmington, Del., event from the Trump campaign and Fox News provided a lesson in epistemic closure, and how in Trump-friendly media, Biden is constantly on the verge of collapse. In the 24 hours after the news conference, a voter who learned about it from the Trump campaign and Fox News might think Biden gave a dangerously incoherent performance and that the media covered it up \u2014 though the event was carried live on TV.\u201cIt was pretty hard to watch, the digressions, the stammering, the confusion all on display,\u201d Fox News's Sean Hannity told viewers Tuesday night.Fox's prime time programming covered the Biden event as a debacle, focusing on moments when the Democratic nominee paused or restarted a sentence, which happened a few times over the course of an hour.\u00a0As in most other media, the most talked-about question was the one asked by Fox News reporter Doug McKelway: \u201cHave you been tested for some degree of cognitive decline?\u201d On Fox, the question hardly needed an answer; conservative TV anchor Raymond Arroyo told Fox's Laura Ingraham that \u201cpeople who watched this, and I spoke to Democrats and Republicans, they felt really bad watching Biden.\u201dThe Trump campaign got three short videos out of the news conference. One compiled moments when Biden paused, draining the color from the clips and labeling them part of a \u201csilent movie.\u201d Another played Marvin Gaye's \u201cLet's Get It On\u201d over clips of reporters asking questions about the campaign or the president. And another focused on Biden's remarks about the \u201clist\u201d of reporters there to insist that Biden's \u201chandlers are afraid of him going off script.\u201dThat theme continued all day Wednesday. Rudolph W. Giuliani, who is 18 months younger than Biden, told reporters at the White House that the media was covering up the decline in what he mistakenly called Biden's \u201cinterview.\u201d\u201cHe took long pauses in answering questions, and he had a teleprompter,\u201d Giuliani said. \u201cHe's having trouble reading, not just thinking.\u201dThe president's middle son, Eric, had taken another direction, saying on Fox News that the shame of the news conference was that Biden did not get the same sort of questions that his opponent did.\u201cMy father's getting shouted at by crazy Jim Acosta every single day,\u201d Trump said. \u201cHe's literally getting lambasted by these people, and you see these little softballs, where Joe Biden's going through this list.\u201dThe president himself cohered both arguments into one tweet, falsely accusing Biden of colluding with reporters on the questions and answers. \u201cHe read the answers from a teleprompter,\u201d Trump tweeted. But while Biden read from a short speech on the teleprompter, and while he had a list identifying which reporters were in the room, he had no heads up on the questions, and no script for the answers.Portraying Biden as a \u201cdeclining,\u201d incoherent bumbler is central to the Trump reelection message. When Biden doesn't stumble memorably, the president's reelection machine is ready for that, too, making a supercut of moments when he searched for words. The looming question: whether this technique would work for an event, such as debates or a convention speech, likely to be viewed in real time by millions of people.Ad watchJoe Biden, \u201cCacerolazo.\u201d A spot designed exclusively for the Miami media market, this drew outrage from some of the online left, with accusations that the Democrat was running against Black Lives Matter. But protesters appear in the ad in the context of being suppressed by police, on orders of the president. The thrust of the ad is that Trump is behaving like an authoritarian thug, with Spanish-speaking viewers in Miami prodded to compare him to Cuba's Castros and Venezuela's Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.Mitch McConnell, \u201cDefeat the Mob.\u201d One of two new McConnell spots that focus on the protests that unfolded across the country last month, this features the Senate majority leader speaking straight to the camera, unloading on how \u201cthe mobs have come for our founders and our heroes.\u201d There's a mention of Seattle's anarchic free zone, which was shut down as the ad began running, and even a mention of the Lenin statue that stands in that city. \u201cWhen the dust settles, it is never the mobs or the looters who we honor,\u201d McConnell says.CFG Action, \u201cGame Time.\u201d The Club for Growth is helping former Auburn University football coach Tommy Tuberville in his Senate primary runoff with former attorney general Jeff Sessions. Like much recent Club output, the focus is on Trump, and specifically on how Tuberville will be an ally of the president while Sessions recused himself from the Russia probe. \u201cAlabama wants winners, not recusers,\u201d says a narrator.Doug Jones, \u201cFor Each Other.\u201d The senator waiting for either Tuberville or Sessions at the end of their primary continues to run ads that offer no red meat whatsoever, portraying him as an ideology-free politician who is concerned about public safety during the pandemic. \u201cIn Alabama, we do this for each other,\u201d Jones says, pulling on a mask after emphasizing that the end of the pandemic would allow businesses to reopen. \n  \n  \n  You are reading The Trailer, the newsletter that brings the campaign trail to your inbox.  \n   \n   \n    \n   \n   \n  \n \nPoll watchWhat's the likelihood you might vote for this candidate? (Monmouth, 733 registered voters)Donald TrumpCertain: 34%Not at all: 50%Joe BidenCertain: 40%Not at all: 39%This monthly poll has found Biden with a lead all year, growing every month, though the 12-point lead this time isn't very different from the previous, 11-point Biden lead. But Monmouth is finding an intensity gap that cuts against the main argument being made by Trump allies recently: that the president, unlike Biden, has an enthusiastic support base. While more support for Trump is positive (for him) and more support for Biden is negative (against Trump), far more voters are considering Biden, and slightly more Biden voters are firm in their support. When Monmouth gave voters a generic third-party option, Biden's lead stayed at 12 points. When the Green and Libertarian nominees were added, by name, Biden's lead stretched slightly to 13 points, and Trump's support fell to 39 percent.Money watchFor the second month running, Joe Biden and his coordinated campaign out-fundraised the president and the Republican National Committee. Biden and the DNC announced Wednesday that they'd raised $141 million in the month of June; Trumpworld had announced, a few hours earlier, a $131 million haul. On Twitter, a giddy Biden campaign spent the evening mocking Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale, who'd celebrated the smaller GOP number by tweeting that Americans were \u201cvoting with their wallets.\u201dBiden's campaign did not reveal its cash on hand, which was almost certainly lower than the Trump campaign's. Even after spending $100 million in June, an period that saw the president's disappointing return to the campaign trail and a series of anti-Biden ad buys, the president's reelection effort had $295 million left to spend. As of May 31, the last date we have information for, Biden had a bit more than $82 million in the bank.Something we don't yet know, and won't until the FEC publishes full candidate filings, is whether Biden's under-the-radar campaign is slowing down his burn rate. The president held two big in-person fundraisers last month, and the aforementioned Tulsa rally; Biden's travel and rental expenses never got much bigger than a flight and a high school gym. While the Biden campaign made a $15 million ad buy in June, the Trump campaign spent a bit more. And the most vital aspect of the Trump campaign's cash advantage has been its years-long volunteer training program, something Biden has no choice but to catch up to.Still, Biden has quickly evolved from a laggard fundraiser with a high burn rate to a candidate who can break Democratic Party fundraising records. According to the campaign, 2.6 million of its June donors had not given before. Even without the use of Bernie Sanders's donor list, the Democratic nominee is now outmatching Trump. That's no guarantee of victory, and not long ago, Mitt Romney repeatedly outraised President Barack Obama on his way to losing the 2012 election. But if you were watching fundraising numbers before, and noticed that the combined totals for Democrats outpaced donations to Trump, you can see how Biden consolidated a free-spending donor base.In the statesTuesday's elections produced a new Republican star in Colorado, but they also ended one of the Democrats' most divisive primaries and expanded Medicaid in a deep red state that had resisted the policy for a decade.In Colorado, former governor John Hickenlooper easily defeated former state House speaker Andrew Romanoff, after a stretch of bad news that raised questions about Hickenlooper's electability. Ballots were sent to voters the very day that Hickenlooper blew off a state ethics commission meeting; ballots were being returned by the time Hickenlooper paid back $2,750 for travel gifts uncovered by a Republican group.It was not enough to help Romanoff, who has now lost his third election in 10 years. Romanoff, who had moved to the left since his days as a legislator, defeated Hickenlooper at the party's activist-heavy convention and argued that the ethics fine made him less electable against Sen. Cory Gardner. But at best, the scandal reduced Hickenlooper's expected landslide to a slightly smaller landslide. By Thursday, after 96 percent of ballots had been counted, Hickenlooper led by 18 points and had carried all but one county \u2014 rural Saguache, where fewer than 2,000 votes were cast.When the count is over, more than 1 million ballots are likely to have been cast in the primary. While only recently have independents been allowed to vote in Colorado's Democratic contests, that's going to set a record. In 2010, when only Democrats could vote in the primary, Romanoff lost a challenge to Sen. Michael F. Bennet in a race where just 338,186 votes were cast. This week, Romanoff got tens of thousands of more votes than that, only to lose so decisively that he endorsed Hickenlooper within an hour of polls closing.Turnout was markedly higher for both parties across all races compared with 2018. More than 200,000 votes were cast in the Democratic and Republican primaries for the aforementioned 3rd District, with Republican turnout slightly edging out Democrats. (Republicans had no statewide race to turn out for.) Dianne Mitsch Bush, the former state legislator who lost the district's 2018 race for Democrats, easily defeated a more moderate but less-known candidate.In Oklahoma, pro-Medicaid-expansion campaigners overcame the challenges of a summer election, picked by state leaders because turnout would have been higher in November, and passed State Question 802 by just one point, a margin of fewer than 7,000 votes. By all evidence, the negative campaigning made a dent. Early votes broke by a 3-to-1 margin in favor of the measure, but Election Day and later absentee votes broke against it.What moved numbers? The campaign by the Oklahoma Council of Public Affairs, which deluged the state with ads, labeled the measure a \u201ctakeover\u201d that would empower left-wing Democrats to run Oklahomans' health care. Its ads targeted four well-known Democratic Party figures: Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Nancy Pelosi and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. (Tellingly, the ads did not bother with Joe Biden.) That moved partisan Republican support, though not enough to sink the measure, in a state where the president won 65 percent of the vote.Down the ballot, Republicans set up an August runoff between state Sen. Stephanie Bice and previously unsuccessful candidate Terry Neese. The winner will face Democratic Rep. Kendra Horn in one of several 2020 races where a seat once held by a male Republican will be held, no matter the result, by a woman. In a small irony, ads against Bice focused on her support for 2016 presidential candidate Carly Fiorina, who has become a critic of the president. Neese served as Fiorina's co-chair in Oklahoma.In Utah, while the GOP gubernatorial primary was too close to call, former NFL player Burgess Owens fended off three rivals to win the nomination in 4th Congressional District. He's the second black Republican to win the nomination in the seat, which was held for two terms by Mia Love. And he was helped by frequent appearances on Fox News, which gave him more earned media than state legislator Kim Coleman, who was backed by Sen. Mike Lee. Owens will face Rep. Ben McAdams, who narrowly beat Love in 2018, but he ended the primary with just over $110,000 cash on hand, to $2.2 million for McAdams.Candidate trackerThe final campaign day before the holiday weekend was dominated by the June jobs numbers, which found 4.5 million people returning to the workforce despite a slowdown at the end of the month.

Subscribe today.arrow-rightThe CampaignWHY \u2018LESS IS MORE\u2019 FOR BIDEN:\u00a0The final four months of a presidential campaign typically unfold at a frenetic pace. It's not uncommon for candidates to start the day in one state, attend an event in another, campaign some more in a third, and then overnight somewhere else entirely. Then they do it again the next day.\u00a0Now, of course, the novel coronavirus pandemic has changed all that.\u00a0ADAnd, in some very tangible ways, that has been a boon for presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden, who polls show has gotten a significant bump while he's stayed out of the spotlight and in the \u201cbasement,\u201d as critics like to say, ceding the rest of the house to President Trump.\u00a0ADIt's not you, it's me: Democratic voters appear highly motivated headed into November. But not necessarily to rally around Biden as much as to oust Trump.New polling data shows Biden is, to many of these voters, in some ways beside the point.We\u2019ve all seen the slew of recent polling showing Biden with significant leads in key battleground states, including Arizona, Florida, Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and North Carolina. (The typical caveats apply: poll numbers can and will change.)\u00a0ADDigging into the cross tabs of a recent New York Times/Siena College battleground state poll \u2014 taken early to mid-June \u2014 we also find the dramatic extent to which both Trump and Biden voters are motivated by \u2026 Trump.\u00a0When the president\u2019s supporters in Florida and Arizona were asked, \u201cIs your vote more of a vote for Donald Trump or a vote against Joe Biden?\u201d about 80 percent said it was an affirmative vote for Trump.When Biden voters in those two states were asked the same question, more than 60 percent in each state said their vote was more \u201ca vote against Donald Trump\u201d while about 35 said their vote was more \u201ca vote for Joe Biden.\u201dThe trends were similar in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and Michigan, key swing states Trump won in 2016, where a majority of Biden supporters said their choice of the Democrat represented more of a vote against Trump.It's not just Democrats:Polls show independent voters supporting Biden are particularly motivated by Trump, with 78 percent of independents in Florida saying their vote for Biden is more a vote against the president, and around 70 percent of independents saying the same in the key states of Arizona, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.Biden leads Trump among independents by around 20 percentage points in Arizona, Florida, North Carolina and Pennsylvania; and by 7 and 9 percentage points in Wisconsin and Michigan, respectively.An enthusiasm gap: Trump and his campaign aides are fretting about the recent string of bad news. They've tried to parry it by arguing Republicans are far more enthusiastic about the president than Democrats are about the former vice president. \u00a0\u201cPresident Trump has historic support within his own party,\u201d the campaign said in a memo sent to reporters last week.\u00a0AD\u201cAnd when it comes to the most important factor, enthusiasm, President Trump is dominating. The unprecedented enthusiasm behind the president\u2019s reelection efforts stands in stark contrast to the flat, almost nonexistent enthusiasm for Biden,\u201d campaign manager Brad Parscale wrote in a Post op-ed today.\u00a0This is the dreaded \u201centhusiasm gap\u201d about which strategists often like to talk.\u00a0But Trump campaign advisers may have turned this dynamic upside down to show a stronger picture than exists for the president.ADRepublicans are enthusiastic about voting for Trump, but it's also clear Democrats \u00a0\u2014 even those for whom Biden was their second or third choice as the party's nominee \u2014 are pretty excited about voting against the president.It's perhaps that dynamic on which the strategists should be focusing.Base politics: Meanwhile, the president\u2019s public remarks on the George Floyd protests and the pandemic \u2014 which he has repeatedly called the \u201cKung flu\u201d \u2014 have been highly inflammatory, signaling Trump is doubling down on the culture wars that animated his first presidential campaign \u00a0Those instincts might help shore up support among his base but they also turn up the sense of urgency among those who do not like what they see and hear.\u00a0\u00a0Already, the 2018 midterms showed that white, college-educated women had significant reservations about the president.\u00a0With the United States undergoing a dramatic transformation in public consensus around race and structural racism, Trump's highly divisive message garners negative headlines. But it does little to expand his political coalition.\u00a0ADADKey quote: \u201cThe President\u2019s message is the same as it was in 2016. The country has changed, but his messaging has not,\u201d said Whit Ayres, a prominent Republican pollster.Trump weighed in yesterday in a tweet by contending painting \u201cBlack Lives Matters\u201d on Fifth Avenue in New York \u2014 proposed by mayor Bill de Blasio (D) \u2014 would be \u201ca symbol of hate\u201d despite widespread support for the peaceful protests against racism and police violence.The day before, the president dug in on his defense of Confederate iconography, warning in a tweet he would veto a defense bill renaming Fort Bragg and other military bases named after confederate military leaders.Laying low: Meanwhile, Biden's camp has appeared perfectly content allowing the campaign to unfold without much attention falling on the former\u00a0vice president, who in the past has been prone to misspeaking \u2014 even as this has especially irked organizers and voters of color who would like to hear him speak more\u00a0forcefully\u00a0about efforts to defund police departments (something he doesn't support). \u00a0The strategy, as my colleague Michael Scherer wrote earlier this week in an excellent piece, has reinforced the\u00a0frame of the 2020 election as a referendum on Trump himself.\u00a0\u201cThe contrast extends to their public travel,\u201d Michael wrote. \u201cOver the last 10 days, Trump logged about 4,000 miles on Air Force One to hold events in three states, including two rallies that attracted thousands of people.\u201d\u201cBiden\u00a0held\u00a0two remote local television interviews and a couple of virtual events and took a one-hour drive from his home to the courtyard of a Lancaster, Pa., recreation center, where he met with five citizens to talk about health care before giving a speech on the topic that received scant national attention.\u201d\u00a0And the former vice president has acknowledged the extent to which his low visibility is helping him.AD\u201cThe more that Donald Trump is out the worse he does. I think it is wonderful that he goes out,\u201d Biden quipped at a virtual event over the weekend. \u201cI\u2019m being a bit facetious because it is dangerous what he is doing at his rallies. But look at it: His numbers have dropped through the floor.\u201dADThe big question remaining is whether the broad coalition of voters Biden needs to win will demand more specificity and a higher profile on key issues from him in the months ahead. \n  \n  \n  You are reading the Power Up newsletter. \n  Not a regular subscriber? \n   \n   \n    \n   \n   \n  \n \nAt the PentagonCLINT LORANCE GOT A PARDON, BUT HIS UNIT CAN'T SHED HIS PAST: \u201cLorance had been in charge of his platoon for only three days when he ordered his men to kill three Afghans stopped on a dirt road. A second-degree murder conviction and pardon followed. Today, Lorance is hailed as a hero by [Trump]. His troops have suffered a very different fate,\u201d our colleague Greg Jaffe reports this morning in a special report on \u201cThe Cursed Platoon\u201d Lorance left behind.ADWhile in command, Lorance averaged a war crime a day, a military jury found: \u201cOn his last day before he was dismissed, he ordered his troops to open fire on three Afghan men standing by a motorcycle on the side of the road who he said posed a threat,\u201d our colleague writes. \u201cHis actions led to a 19-year prison sentence.\u201dADBut now Lorance has a book deal and has joined Trump onstage at a rally: \u201cFor the men of 1st platoon, part of the 82nd Airborne Division, the costs of the war and the fallout from the case have been profound and sometimes deadly,\u201d our colleague writes.Since returning home in 2013, five of the platoon\u2019s three dozen soldiers have died: \u201cAt least four others have been hospitalized following suicide attempts or struggles with drugs or alcohol. The last fatality came a few weeks before Lorance was pardoned when James O. Twist, 27, a Michigan state trooper and father of three, died of suicide.\u201dOutside the BeltwayCORONAVIRUS CASES ARE CLIMBING: For the first time since the pandemic began, U.S. cases topped 50,000 a day at a huge 52,780. The awful new numbers come as Americans plan to celebrate July Fourth weekend, and many states and governors are urging them to stay away from celebrations outside their homes while rolling back reopening plans in key states.ADCalifornia, Texas, Arizona, North Carolina and Georgia all broke their previous records for cases in a single day.\u00a0States that reopened first are the ones with the most cases.Yet Trump said this to Fox Business yesterday: \u201cI think we\u2019re going to be very good with the coronavirus,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI think that, at some point, that\u2019s going to sort of disappear, I hope.\u201d He added he was \u201call for mask\u201d and would himself wear one \u2014 something he's steadfastly declined to do publicly \u2014 \u201cin a tight situation with people.\u201dICYMI, Vanilla Ice plans to hold a 2,500 concert this weekend in Austin, Texas. Yep.Tulsa rally is still reverberating throughout Trump campaign: \u201cIn the past two weeks, the campaign has contended with waves of fallout from the rally, where the president put on a pugilistic performance before an arena that was only partly filled,\u201d Josh Dawsey and Carol D. Leonnig report.ADThe fallout began before the event even started: \u201cIt was just hours before [Trump] was set to take the stage for his rally in Tulsa last month when the news broke: Six staff at the site had just tested positive for the coronavirus,\u201d our colleagues write. \u201cThe president, who was en route from Washington, was livid that the news was public, according to people familiar with his reaction.\u201dSome top aides like campaign manager Brad Parscale have self-quarantined: The hope had been the rally would signal a return to normal for the campaign. \u201cBut some advisers now see the rally as ill-advised, an event that created a cascade of problems that have challenged the campaign and its staff. Campaign officials had previously said they were planning more large rallies, but the Tulsa event has led to increased concerns and debates on how \u2014 and whether \u2014 they can be pulled off. \u201dAt The White HouseNO RESPONSE TO RUSSIAN BOUNTIES PLANNED: \u201cThe White House is not planning an immediate response to intelligence reports of Russian bounties given to Taliban-linked militants to kill U.S. and coalition forces in Afghanistan because [Trump] does not believe the reports are true or \u2018actionable,\u2019 according to two senior administration officials,\u201d Ellen Nakashima, Josh Dawsey, Karen DeYoung and Shane Harris report.ADADThe debate inside the White House: \u201cOne administration official said there is an internal White House dispute about how much information to declassify to support the president\u2019s skepticism of the intelligence. Some of Trump\u2019s own senior intelligence officials viewed the information as credible enough to warn the Pentagon and allies so they could ensure they had measures in place to protect their forces in Afghanistan, and to begin developing options for responding to the Russian operation, national security adviser Robert C. O\u2019Brien said.\u201dRussia appears to be increasingly emboldened: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t require a top-secret clearance and access to the government\u2019s most classified information to see that the list of Russian aggressions in recent weeks rivals some of the worst days of the Cold War,\u201d the New York Times's David E. Sanger and Eric Schmitt report.A recap of what's happened: \u201cThere have been new cyberattacks on Americans working from home to exploit vulnerabilities in their corporate systems and continued concern about new playbooks for Russian actors seeking to influence the November election. Off the coast of Alaska, Russian jets have been testing American air defenses, sending U.S. warplanes scrambling to intercept them.\u201dBut for now there's no response: \u201cYet missing from all this is a strategy for pushing back \u2014 old-fashioned deterrence, to pluck a phrase from the depths of the Cold War \u2014 that could be employed from Afghanistan to Ukraine, from the deserts of Libya to the vulnerable voter registration rolls in battleground states.\u201d\u00a0ViralTHREE GRAPHICS TO UNDERSTAND COVID:THE NEW HIGH: \u201cNewly reported cases across the United States on Wednesday catapulted to a new high \u2014 52,788 in all \u2014 as individual states continued to topple their own grim records. Hospitalizations and deaths also continued to surge in some areas amid scattered reopening efforts,\u201d Michael Brice-Saddler and Jacqueline Dupree report.ADThe surge has been led by states that reopened first as infections rose 50 percent in June: \u201cStates that took an aggressive approach to reopening led the country in infection spikes \u2014 along with California, the nation\u2019s most populous state, where leaders have been more cautious. California reported 110 new deaths, more than any other state,\u201d Anne Gearan, Derek Hawkins and Siobh\u00e1n O'Grady report.The pandemic is exacerbating an existing health crisis: \u201cNationwide, federal and local officials are reporting alarming spikes in drug overdoses \u2014 a hidden epidemic within the pandemic. Emerging evidence suggests that the continued isolation, economic devastation and disruptions to the drug trade in recent months are fueling the surge,\u201d William Wan and Heather Long report.The grim reality: \u201cData obtained by The Washington Post from a real-time tracker of drug-related emergency calls and interviews with coroners suggest that overdoses have not just increased since the pandemic began but are accelerating as it persists.\u201d\u00a0This level of global economic devastation hasn't been seen since WWII: \u201cThe global economy is suffering its deepest recession since World War II, according to the World Bank, with most countries experiencing downturns at one time since 1870. It\u2019s the fourth deepest recession in the last 150 years, twice as deep as the Great Recession of the late 2000s,\u201d Anthony Faiola reports.Poverty is projected to skyrocket: \u201cUp to 100 million people globally are poised to fall into extreme poverty, the first increase since the Asian and Latin America financial crises of the 1990s, and the biggest increase since the World Bank began tracking the number in 1990.\u201d\u00a0In the MediaWHAT ELSE YOU NEED TO KNOW:Biden continues to outraise Trump: \u201cAs the presidential campaigns gear up in earnest for the general election, supporters are contributing in massive amounts to support the two presumptive candidates, with [Biden] outraising [Trump] by $10 million in June, according to new figures,\u201d Michelle Ye Hee Lee and Annie Linskey report. \u201cThat means Biden outraised Trump for the second month in a row.\u201dThe president is set to host a private high-dollar fundraiser in Florida next week: \u201cThe invitation does not name the owner of the home hosting the $580,600-per-couple event. Campaign manager Brad Parscale, RNC chairwoman Ronna McDaniel and other senior RNC fundraisers are listed as hosts of the event,\u201d Josh Dawsey and Michelle Ye Hee Lee report.Mary Trump's book is back on: \u201cA New York court lifted a temporary restraining order against the publication of a book by President Trump\u2019s niece, enabling publisher Simon & Schuster to continue printing and distributing the explosive insider account by Mary L. Trump,\u201d Michael Kranish reports.\u00a0Capital fireworks will still go Fourth: \u201cFlyovers by the Air Force\u2019s Thunderbirds and the Navy\u2019s Blue Angels jet demonstration teams, plus a huge fireworks display, will highlight the Fourth of July festivities Saturday on the Mall, the Interior Department announced,\u201d Michael E.

Subscribe today.arrow-rightBack in Pennsylvania, the presumptive Democratic nominee will unveil more of his economic plan in a much-awaited speech later today. \u201cBiden plans to unveil a proposal to spend $700 billion on American products and research, challenging President Trump\u2019s \u2018America first\u2019 agenda with a competing brand of economic nationalism and setting the stage for an election-year showdown over the country\u2019s financial future,\u201d Sean Sullivan and Jeff Stein report this morning.\u00a0The Biden campaign says the plan will help bring back jobs lost amid the pandemic: The plan aims to \u201ccreate at least 5 million more with sweeping investments in domestic technology; reduce dependence on foreign countries to supply critical goods; and implement trade and tax policies that empower U.S. workers,\u201d per my colleagues. \u00a0The party's liberal flank has been nervous that talk of a New Dealer-in-chief is being lost amid his campaign's focus on President Trump's failures, Sean reports. \u201cI think it\u2019s dangerous to set as the main protagonist of your campaign somebody other than yourself,\u201d Maurice Mitchell, the national director of the Working Families Party, a liberal organization, told my colleague.ADADLiberals are especially wary since Biden's calls for transformation at the start of the general election were already a sea change for someone who spent most of his decades in the Senate in the middle of the road and reportedly grated liberal lawmakers with his dealmaking as former vice president.\u00a0The core of what Biden will say is unlikely to placate those concerns.\u00a0\u201cBiden will call for a moderate approach toward reviving the U.S. economy if elected president \u2026,\" Bloomberg News's Jennifer Epstein reports. The reason for that focus isn't all that surprising; the former veep's camp is hoping to attract more Republican and independent voters.\u00a0\u2018An incremental path\u2019: \u201cBiden wants to get to the same place that many to his left want to get to but he firmly believes that it will take an incremental path to get there and that you can\u2019t leapfrog the political reality that he has come to know in many decades in politics,\u201d Jared Bernstein, who is advising the campaign, told Bloomberg. Bernstein served as Biden\u2019s chief economic adviser in the vice president\u2019s office.A key focus is being placed on domestic manufacturing, after companies struggled to produce medical supplies during the pandemic. \u201c[Biden] is advocating a $400 billion procurement initiative to spur demand for American products and services, as well as a $300 billion investment in U.S. research and breakthrough technologies. Half of the $300 billion is in clean-energy initiatives that were previously announced, the campaign said,\u201d my colleagues write.ADADFor now, the pay-fors are still vague: The former vice president's campaign says \u201che will reverse some of Trump\u2019s tax cuts for corporations and impose \u2018common-sense tax reforms that finally make sure the wealthiest Americans pay their fair share.'\"\u00a0Liberals will see some similarities to other ideas floated in the primary, \u201cincluding a version of Elizabeth Warren\u2019s proposal to use the federal procurement process to buy American-made products, two people briefed on Biden\u2019s proposals said. But while Warren\u2019s proposal focused on clean energy, Biden\u2019s is broader and aimed at broadly stimulating the economy.\u201d\u00a0There are some concessions to the left.\u00a0Allies of Biden and his onetime rival Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) released 110 pages of joint policy recommendations, a sign of cooperation ahead of the Democratic National Convention and the writing of the party's nonbinding platform, the New York Times\u2019s Sydney Ember reports.\u00a0ADRep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) told NPR that the recommendations will make it easier to sell Biden's candidacy to Sanders supporters.\u00a0ADSanders praised Biden after the release: \u201cI think the compromise that they came up with, if implemented, will make Biden the most progressive president since FDR,\u201d Sanders told MSNBC's Chris Hayes.\u201cBiden is expected to adopt the recommendations, which were submitted by six policy task forces and cover a wide range of issues including health care, criminal justice, education and climate change,\u201d per the Times.\u201cRecommendations included a proposal from the economy task force for an executive order to prohibit government contracts with companies that pay less than a $15 minimum wage or that do not remain neutral in unionization efforts; a goal from the climate change task force to eliminate carbon emissions from power plants by 2035; and the creation of an environmental justice fund that will invest in federal agencies to eliminate the disproportionate burden of pollution and environmental hazards that communities of color bear.\u201dRepublicans say the policy recommendations are a sign Biden is lurching to the left.\u00a0\"The fact Joe Biden has embraced Bernie Sanders\u2019 radical agenda verbatim is proof that while Bernie may not be the one leading the Democrat Party, Biden is more than happy to be his champion in its lurch to the left,\" RNC spokesman Steve Guest tweeted. \u00a0ADAnd Trump has long tried to whip traders into a frenzy by forecasting economic ruin if Biden ousts him.\u00a0But Wall Street, so far, seem to be more tempered. Markets are continuing to hit record highs even as an avalanche of national and state polling favors Biden. \u201cThat's because investors are betting a President Biden would moderate his policy proposals \u2014 including raising taxes on the rich and corporations \u2014 to fit the weak economy he would inherit. They're also expecting the negatives, like higher regulation, would be offset by positives like fewer tariffs,\u201d CNN Business's Matt Egan reports.ADOne analyst even predicts a Biden win could be a boon for stocks: \u201cThe consensus view is that a Democrat victory in November will be a negative for equities. However, we see this outcome as neutral to slightly positive,\u201d JPMorgan strategists led by Dubravko Lakos-Bujas wrote in a note to clients Monday, CNN reports.Remember: This is the same Wall Street where some traders were beginning to price in the prospects of a President Warren, but was largely silent during Sanders's primary boomlet.A blowout could send shares spiraling, but history says it won't last long. \u201cThere have been five times since World War II when a Democratic president was backed by a unified Democratic majority in Congress: 1948, 1960, 1976, 1992 and 2008. Markets reacted negatively, but only initially,\u201d CNN reports.\u00a0ADSome slumps later turned into gains: \u201cThe S&P 500 declined by an average 2.4 percent in November following those Democratic sweeps, according to Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research. By December of those years, the S&P 500 gained an average of 3.1 percent, advancing in every instance. Even more significant: The S&P 500 rallied an average of 10.4% in the subsequent calendar year as the shock wore off, gaining ground in all but one year, CFRA found.\u201dNote: The Finance 202 is taking a break tomorrow. Have a great weekend.\u00a0Trump trackerSCOTUS set to rule on whether Trump can shield his financial records.\u00a0The decision will be one of the last actions for the high court this term: \u201cThe court said Wednesday that opinions in all remaining cases would be issued [today]. The court in May held teleconferenced hearings \u2014 with the world listening in \u2014 on three cases with potential landmark constitutional consequences,\u201d Robert Barnes reports.AD\"All concern Trump\u2019s long-running legal fight to shield years of income tax returns from public view and keep his private financial records from the hands of Democratic-led House committees and Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. The court\u2019s decisions will carry major implications for the limits of presidential power and accountability, and could affect the fall election.ADA reminder of the lower court rulings: \u201cFederal judges in New York and Washington, D.C. \u2014 at the district court and appeals court levels \u2014 moved swiftly by court standards and repeatedly ruled against Trump and to uphold Congress\u2019s broad investigative powers. In Washington, a divided panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit in October rejected Trump\u2019s assertion that Congress\u2019s subpoena was an unconstitutional attempt to harass the president that lacked a \u2018legitimate legislative purpose.\u2019\u201dLatest on the federal responseBig banks aren't buying into the Fed's Main Street lending program.Overall, interest remains muted: \u201cMore than three months after the Fed announced a new effort to shore up the economy aimed at small and medium-size businesses, its $600 billion loan program has only one of the nation\u2019s largest banks signed on to deliver the loans to new customers,\u201d Rachel Siegel reports. \u201cOf the nation\u2019s largest banks, only Bank of America has registered.\u201dAD\u201cThe Fed\u2019s Main Street program has become a sort of litmus test for how effective the central bank\u2019s multifaceted response to the recession can be. Thousands of banks are eligible to sign up and have been able to register since mid-June. But last week, Fed Chair Jerome H. Powell said only about 300 had registered, including firms making loans solely to existing customers, for which there is no public list. Meanwhile, businesses eager for loans have said they\u2019re hard-pressed to find banks that will issue them.\u201dCoronavirus falloutFrom the U.S.:U.S. added a record 4.8 million jobs in June, but a spike in cases could spoil that momentum: \u201cTwo key federal measurements showed the precarious place the economy finds itself in \u2026 The unemployment rate in June was 11.1 percent, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said, down from a peak of 14.7 percent in April but still far above the 3.5 percent level notched in February. And another 1.4 million Americans applied for unemployment insurance for the first time last week and more than 19 million people are still receiving unemployment benefits, stubbornly high levels that show how many people are struggling to find or keep work,\u201d Eli Rosenberg and Heather Long report.Trump pressures schools to reopen: The president slammed \u201cthe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, pressuring it to loosen guidance and threatening to cut funding for schools that do not open. The CDC was already planning to issue new guidelines for schools in the coming days. But Vice President Pence explicitly tied the effort to Trump\u2019s ire,\u201d Laura Meckler reports.From the corporate front:Brooks Brothers files for bankruptcy: \u201cThe company expects to close 51 of its 250 North American stores and will halt production next month at its factories in Massachusetts, North Carolina and New York, which produce less than 7 percent of its finished goods. Remaining stores will reopen in compliance with local public health orders tied to the pandemic,\u201d Jacob Bogage and Abha Bhattarai report.Bed Bath & Beyond will close over 200 stores over the next two years: The company said \u201cits sales tumbled nearly 50 percent during its latest quarter, even as online sales surged more than 100 percent during April and May, with consumers stocking up on cleaning supplies and home decor,\u201d CNBC's Lauren Thomas reports.Retail workers are being drawn into the fight over masks: \u201cSome workers say they have been told they cannot refuse service to maskless customers, even if local laws require it. Others feel they\u2019ve been put in the awkward and sometimes dangerous position of confronting shoppers who refuse to wear the coverings,\u201d Abha Bhattarai reports.Trade fly-aroundAMLO and Trump tout the start of USMCA.The White House was hoping to highlight other news amid the pandemic: \u201c Trump marked the start of a three-nation regional trade deal in a Rose Garden ceremony with Mexican President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador that took on a celebratory tone discordant with the widespread economic damage of the pandemic,\u201d David Nakamura and David J. Lynch report.ADAD\u201cThe two populist-leaning presidents, from opposite ends of the political spectrum, signed a joint proclamation hailing the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, which took effect at the start of July, as the beginning of a new chapter in North America\u2019s economic partnership \u2026 Canada was not represented at the signing after Prime Minister Justin Trudeau reportedly turned down an invitation. But Trump, who said he spoke with Trudeau by phone, and L\u00f3pez Obrador lavished praise on one another and touted their unlikely partnership.\u201dMarket moversTesla's blistering rally could net Elon Musk nearly $2 billion.The car maker continues to hit records: Musk's payday is potentially worth $1.8 billion, \u201chis second jackpot from the electric car maker in about two months,\u201d Reuters's Noel Randewich reports.AD\u201cFueled by stronger-than-expected car deliveries, shares of Tesla have surged over 40% in the past seven sessions, elevating the company\u2019s market capitalization to $259 billion. More important for Musk\u2019s personal finances, Tesla\u2019s six-month average market capitalization has reached a record $138 billion.\u201dThe regulatorsICYMI: CFPB strips some of the consumer protections for payday loans.Consumer advocates slammed the move: \u201cThe CFPB announced \u2026 that it was rescinding mandatory underwriting provisions -- which essentially require lenders to confirm that borrowers can pay back the loan before issuing it -- framing the move as an effort to \u2018maintain consumer access to credit and competition in the marketplace,\u2019\u201d ABC News's Catherine Thorbecke reports.AD\"The payday loans industry has courted controversy for years, with many critics slamming the high interest rates and allegedly predatory practices lenders use on often-desperate customers that can lead to so-called \"debt traps.\" The industry has also faced criticism for allegedly targeting communities of color.

He wants schools to be fully open in the fall. He wants a Republican convention next month to be as normal as possible. So far, the public isn\u2019t buying.The president has the bully pulpit but the public is looking at what\u2019s happening around them.\u00a0About half of states are recording increases in the number of cases of covid-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. In some places, the increases have been dramatic. State and local leaders have been forced to reverse course on previous efforts to reopen businesses.Attitudes are shifting almost as dramatically as the spread of the disease.\u00a0Recent Gallup polling, reported by the organization\u2019s Jeffrey M. Jones, tells the story. More people now say the situation with the virus is getting worse than at any time during the pandemic and expectations about how long the disruption might last are shifting as well. The changes are not at the margins.ADADIn early June, 47 percent said the virus situation was getting a little or a lot better, while 30 percent said it was getting a little or a lot worse. (The rest said it was staying the same.) By the end of June, the numbers had flipped, with 23 percent saying the situation was a little or a lot better and 65 percent saying it was a little or a lot worse. In a month, there was a 35-point spike in the percentage of people saying things were getting worse.The previous high point of those saying things were getting worse was in early April, when 56 percent said that. Through most of the spring and early summer, the percentage saying things were getting worse hovered around 42 percent.As the disease spreads, Americans are recalibrating their expectations about the future. In the late June survey, 74 percent said they now expect disruption of their lives due to the disease to last until the end of this year or longer. That group is split evenly between those who expect things to return closer to normal by year\u2019s end and those who say it will be at least sometime in 2021 before that happens.ADADIn early June, 54 percent said they thought the disruptions would last to the end of the year or beyond. That means during the month of June, there was a 20-point jump in the direction of pessimism about the lasting effects of the pandemic.As with all such polling, there are significant partisan differences in the way people see things.While 90 percent of Democrats said things are getting worse, just 28 percent of Republicans held that view. Among independents, 63 percent said the situation is getting worse.But the trendlines all moved in unison toward more concern. In the week between June 21 and June 28, there was a 15-point rise among Democrats, an 18-point jump among independents and an 8-point increase among Republicans.ADMore people are worried about getting covid-19. Currently, 56 percent say they are worried, which is just 1 point below the peak of concern back in April and a rise of 9 points since early June.People are more cautious about going out in public. In one week, the percentage who said even healthy people with no symptoms should stay at home as much as possible rose 6 points, from 66 percent to 72 percent. That compares with 28 percent who said that healthy people should try to lead their lives as normally as possible.Trump\u2019s latest initiative is to encourage schools to open up this fall.\u00a0He pressed the idea on Tuesday and on Wednesday morning tweeted his displeasure with the guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, calling them \u201cvery tough and expensive.\u201d He said the CDC was asking schools to do \u201cvery impractical things,\u201d adding, \u201cI will be meeting with them!!!\u201d A few hours later, Vice President Pence said the CDC will soon reissue school guidance. Yet on Thursday morning, CDC Director Robert Redfield said on ABC's \u201cGood Morning America\u201d that the guidelines won't be revised, but \u201cwe are going to provide additional reference documents.\u201dADADThat continues a pattern of the president disagreeing with the scientists and institutions tasked with public health and attempting to jawbone them into taking a different position. But there is now a track record of what can happen when states and cities ignore guidelines.Some of the states that moved fastest to reopen their economies \u2014 \u00a0in many cases paying minimal attention to the government\u2019s guidelines on when and how to reopen \u2014 \u00a0have since seen enormous increases in coronavirus cases. Among them are Texas, Arizona and Florida.The issue of school reopening is enormously difficult. School administrators are weighing the health risks to students, their families and their communities of fully returning to schools this fall against the long-term damage to young people who could fall behind academically and in their social development if they are not back in the classroom. That is especially the case for elementary and secondary students without access to fast Internet, good computers and parents who can spend time helping with remote learning.ADADColleges and universities are weighing the same issues, as well as the economic costs to their institutions of lost tuition money if they aren\u2019t providing a learning environment attractive to students. On a cautionary note, there is some evidence there are clear risks of having thousands of young people gathered on campuses, studying and partying as they are likely to do.Trump prefers to be a cheerleader, painting rhetorically with a broad brush that pushes aside the complications that come with all these decisions. The reason is obvious. He wants to return to the pre-pandemic America, a country with a vibrant economy, which he sought as the foundation of his reelection campaign.Instead, reality continues to get in his way. Trump can say what he does, but people are drawing their own conclusions \u2014 about the state of the coronavirus crisis, the risks they face personally and how to continually adjust their behavior.ADADUntil the spread begins to decline widely, most Americans are likely to be cautious. They will not be looking to the president to make that judgment for them.Quote of the day\u201cA lot people thought once the alarm was sounded back in March surely the federal government would fix this, but that hasn\u2019t happened,\u201d said Deborah Burger, a California nurse and the president of National Nurses United. (William Wan)\u00a0More on the coronavirusHospitals across the Sun Belt are strained.\u00a0\u201cIn pandemic hotspot states such as Florida, Arizona, California and Texas, hospitals are adding new intensive care unit beds and special air-flow systems to treat the growing demand as virus hospitalizations set records almost daily. To cope with the wave of patients, hospitals are canceling elective surgeries to free up space for those sick with the virus. Medical staff warn they could become overwhelmed,\u201d Chelsea Janes, Isaac Stanley-Becker, Lenny Bernstein and Joshua Partlow report. \u201cThe United States passed the 3 million case mark on Wednesday, and more than 129,000 people have died. Florida is rushing some 100 new health-care workers to \u00adMiami-Dade County\u2019s public hospital network to handle the influx of coronavirus cases, including 75 nurses who will be ready to work in intensive care units. \u2026 Texas on Wednesday reported 98 deaths from covid-19, a one-day high that surpassed its earlier record reached on Tuesday, when Arizona and Mississippi also reached one-day highs. Arizona and Texas also hit new highs this week in seven-day rolling averages of deaths. \u2026 About 45 percent of the Texas Medical Center\u2019s 1,364 intensive care unit beds are now filled with coronavirus patients. \u2026 Hospitals are also feeling the strain in Los Angeles County, which is averaging around 2,300 new cases each day.\"The country is running short on masks, gowns and gloves. Again.\u00a0\u201cNurses say they are reusing N95 masks for days and even weeks at a time. Doctors say they can\u2019t reopen offices because they lack personal protective equipment. State officials say they have scoured U.S. and international suppliers for PPE and struggle to get orders filled. Experts worry the problem could worsen as coronavirus infections climb, straining medical systems,\u201d William Wan reports. \u201cIn interviews, White House officials said concerns over PPE shortages are overblown. They said U.S. manufacturing and stockpiles of protective equipment have improved dramatically and are adequate in most states. \u2026 Demand for protective equipment has soared, but unlike in March, when efforts focused on getting PPE for major hospitals \u2026 supplies now are desperately needed by primary care offices, nursing homes, prisons and psychiatric and disability facilities.\u201dTrump\u2019s Tulsa rally is \u201clikely\u201d the source of a virus surge.Tulsa City-County Health Department Director Bruce Dart said the rally \u201clikely contributed\u201d to a dramatic surge in new cases, the AP reports. \u201cTulsa County reported 261 confirmed new cases on Monday, a one-day record high, and another 206 cases on Tuesday. By comparison, during the week before the June 20 Trump rally, there were 76 cases on Monday and 96 on Tuesday. Although the health department\u2019s policy is to not publicly identify individual settings where people may have contracted the virus, Dart said those large gatherings \u2018more than likely\u2019 contributed to the spike.\u201d\u00a0ADADA rapidly growing number of Houston-area residents are dying at home, according to an NBC News and ProPublica investigation. A growing number of these at-home deaths have been linked to covid-19.A Texas GOP convention originally scheduled to be held next week in Houston has been canceled,\u00a0Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner (D) said. \"These are some very serious times,\" Turner said. \"Simply, the public health concerns outweighed anything else.\" (Texas Tribune)But, but, but: Trump is heading to Odessa, Tex., later this month for a fundraiser.\u00a0The invite to the event, shared by the Tribune\u2019s Patrick Svitek, doesn\u2019t specify where in the city the fundraiser will be held, but tickets range from $2,800 to $100,000.Disney World will reopen on Saturday, despite Florida\u2019s worsening outbreak. Disney says that instituting an aggressive cleaning schedule and slew of new health protocols while dramatically cutting down on the visitors allowed means that it can open safely. (Antonia Farzan)Bar crowds and large parties are driving new infections in Louisiana, officials said, leading New Orleans to re-tighten its regulations on indoor gatherings. (Katie Shepherd)A surge of cases linked to fraternity parties is threatening the reopening of U.C. Berkeley. The number of students testing positive has more than tripled in the past week, with 47 new cases reported. (Antonia Farzan)Three dozen people connected to the Mississippi state legislature have tested positive, including 26 lawmakers. (Katie Shepherd)At least 82 cases have been linked to a Missouri summer camp. Kanakuk, which operates several Christian sleepaway camps in the state, shut down its K-2 camp for teenagers by July 2, when 41 campers and employees tested positive. (Antonia Farzan)The daily influx of new cases increased slightly in the D.C. region, with hospitalizations rising in Virginia for the second consecutive day. (Dana Hedgpeth, Julie Zauzmer and Erin Cox)Trump wants schools to reopen. But school officials are pushing against it.\u00a0School officials across the country have concluded they cannot fully reopen while following new CDC guidance that recommends that students be kept six feet apart to prevent spreading the virus, because classrooms are too small to accommodate all students with the recommended distancing, Laura Meckler reports. \u201cThe administration is finding it nearly impossible to control the situation, with the president\u2019s views often at odds with those of his health advisers \u2026 On Wednesday, New York City schools, the nation\u2019s largest school system, announced a plan that will have most students in school two days a week and learning from home the other three. Many other systems have announced or are considering similar plans. \u2026. Trump \u2026 ended with a nebulous threat: \u2018May cut off funding if not open!\u2019 Trump has no power to cut federal funding already allocated to states and districts, but the vice president suggested the administration would seek to tie any future aid to opening of schools.\"Harvard and MIT sued the Trump administration to protect international students.\u00a0\u201cThe\u00a0lawsuit\u00a0represented a swift response to\u00a0an unexpected order issued this week by the federal government, as universities rush to protect the status of thousands of international students. It also marks a new battle line in the war between Trump and education leaders over how to safely reopen schools in the midst of his reelection bid,\u201d Susan Svrluga and Nick Anderson report. \u201cIn their lawsuit, the universities argue that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement\u2019s decision was designed to force universities to conduct in-person classes, part of an apparent political strategy from the Trump administration to pressure schools, from kindergarten to graduate school, to fully reopen this fall, even as virus cases soar. \u2026 The lawsuit cites remarks from acting deputy secretary of homeland security Ken Cuccinelli on Tuesday, in which he said the directive \u2018will \u2026 encourage schools to reopen.\u2019\u201d\u00a0Retail workers are caught in the latest culture war: Getting customers to wear face masks.\u00a0\u201cMixed messaging and politicization have turned a public health safeguard into a lightning-rod issue. As a result, workers have been berated, even assaulted, by aggressive anti-maskers,\u201d Abha Bhattarai reports. \u201cSome workers say they have been told they cannot refuse service to maskless customers, even if local laws require it. Others feel they\u2019ve been put in the awkward and sometimes dangerous position of confronting shoppers who refuse to wear the coverings. In recent weeks, retail workers have been punched in the face, suffered broken limbs and, in the case of\u00a0a security guard at a Family Dollar\u00a0store in Michigan, killed while trying to enforce mask requirements.\u201d\u00a0ADADThe head of the TSA ordered new covid-19 safety precautions after meeting with a whistleblower who said the agency wasn\u2019t doing enough.\u00a0\u201cThe new measures require officers to wear eye protection when they are in close contact with travelers and aren\u2019t protected by a plastic screen, the attorney said. Officers must also change their gloves or sanitize them after patting down passengers, handling identification documents or checking in luggage,\u201d Ian Duncan reports. \u00a0United Airlines warned that it may furlough 36,000 of its employees, almost half of its U.S. workforce. (WSJ)On some planes, some rows are kept empty even as passengers are crowded together.\u00a0On an American Airlines flight, \u201cJoy Gonzalez, an aviation engineer based in Seattle, found herself seated at a window with two older passengers beside her in the middle and aisle seats. In order to gain more social distance, she and the aisle passenger both moved to seats behind them where two rows were empty. But before takeoff, a flight attendant ordered them back to their assigned seats, telling them they had not paid for those exit row seats, which are more expensive,\u201d the Times reports. \u201cAirlines vowed to bring social distancing to the air \u2026 by reducing capacity and blocking many middle seats. Now as air travel builds, freeing up that kind of space is plainly at odds with the airlines\u2019 profit motive, and passengers are finding they may be confined to a cramped seat if they don\u2019t pay for a premium one.\u201d\u00a0ADThings you can no longer do in Japan's theme parks: scream.\u00a0\u201cPlease scream inside your heart,\u201d said two theme park executives in an informational video shown to guests in Japan, the WSJ reports. \u201cFrom Fujiyama to Tokyo DisneySea\u2019s Tower of Terror, Japan\u2019s campaign against the coronavirus is targeting thrill-seekers who might expel a burst of virus-carrying droplets with a mid-ride utterance. Enjoy the ride, say theme-park operators\u2014just don\u2019t let your voice show it.\u201d\u00a0Conservative lawmakers and groups who criticize increased government spending benefited from an aid program.\u00a0\u201cConservative members of Congress and advocacy groups that ardently criticize excessive government spending were among those accepting small-business pandemic relief funds from the Treasury this year, according to data released Monday. Americans for Tax Reform Foundation, led by firebrand anti-tax advocate Grover Norquist, took a loan between $150,000 and $350,000 from the Paycheck Protection Program. The Ayn Rand Institute and Citizens against Government Waste likewise accepted loans funded by the program,\u201d Tom Hamburger, Aaron Gregg and Anu Narayanswamy report. \u201cAmericans for Tax Reform Foundation is one of two related tax revision groups led by Norquist, who famously said: \u2018I don\u2019t want to abolish government. I simply want to reduce it to the size where I can drag it into the bathroom and drown it in the bathtub.\u2019\u201dAlmost one-third of U.S. households missed their July housing payments.\u00a0Thirty-two percent of households haven\u2019t made their full July payments yet, CNBC reports. That makes July the fourth month in a row that a \u201chistorically high\u201d number of households were unable to pay their housing bill on time and in full, up from 30 percent in June.\u00a0The Trump presidencyThe Supreme Court said employers can opt out of Obamacare\u2019s birth control mandate over religious objections.\u201cThe decision greatly expands the ability of employers to claim the exception, and the government estimates that between 70,000 and 126,000 women could lose access to cost-free birth control as a result,\u201d Robert Barnes reports. \u201cThe contraceptive case involves a long-running dispute over Obamacare, as the ACA is known, and a requirement that employers provide cost-free birth control for female employees. The law itself doesn\u2019t specify the rules, leaving it to federal agencies to determine how contraceptives fit into the mandate for cost-free \u2018preventive care and screenings.\u2019 The Obama administration required contraceptives and had narrower exceptions for churches and other houses of worship. \u2026 The Trump administration moved in 2018 to expand the types of organizations that could opt out to include religious groups and nonreligious employers with moral and religious objections. \u2026\u00a0\u201cThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the 3rd Circuit had put the Trump administration exemptions on hold, and said the agencies didn\u2019t have the broad authority to grant them. Justice Clarence Thomas, who wrote the majority opinion, said that was wrong. \u2026 Liberal Justices Elena Kagan and Stephen G. Breyer agreed with the court\u2019s conservatives that the administration had the right to create an exemption, but they said lower courts should examine whether the administration\u2019s rules were \u2018consistent with reasoned judgment.\u2019 Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg issued a blistering dissent, in which she said her colleagues had gone too far to appease religious conservatives.\u201dThe Court also gave religious organizations the ability to hire and fire without offending some anti-discrimination laws.\u201cIn a 7-to-2 decision, the court strengthened the \u2018ministerial exception\u2019 it found in 2012 that protects religious organizations from some employment lawsuits. It said two teachers at parochial schools who wanted to contest their firings in court were the kinds of employees who were covered by the exception and thus unable to sue. It indicated that those involved in almost any kind of religious instruction would be considered \u2018ministers\u2019 of the faith, no matter their official title or even if they practiced the faith themselves,\u201d Robert Barnes reports. \u201cJustices Sonia Sotomayor and Ginsburg dissented, saying the decision gave religious employers \u2018free rein to discriminate.\u2019 \u2026 Breyer and Kagan, usually part of the court\u2019s liberal bloc, voted with the majority.\u201dThe Supreme Court\u2019s decisions will conclude today with what could be a blockbuster decision on whether Trump may shield his private financial records and tax returns from congressional committees and a New York prosecutor.As the economy reels from the pandemic, Trump and Mexico\u2019s L\u00f3pez Obrador mark the start of a trade pact.\u00a0\u201cTrump marked the start of a three-nation regional trade deal in a Rose Garden ceremony with Mexican President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador,\u201d David Nakamura and David Lynch report. \u201cThe two populist-leaning presidents, from opposite ends of the political spectrum, signed a joint proclamation hailing the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement \u2026 Trump thanked his counterpart for responding to U.S. pressure to help curb a major spike in unauthorized immigration last year \u2026 L\u00f3pez Obrador responded that Trump has \u2018honored our position as an independent nation\u2019 and \u2018behaved with kindness and respect.\u2019 The positive comments from the two leaders on Wednesday were striking when compared with the tensions between the neighboring countries in recent years.\"The Russian ambassador said reports of a bounty program to kill U.S. soldiers are a \u201cdownright lie.\u201d\u201c\u2018No concrete evidence has been presented\u2019 of allegations that a Russian military intelligence unit offered to pay Taliban-linked militants to target American and other coalition forces, Anatoly Antonov said. Authors of the reports are \u2018trying to create an impression that our country is an enemy of the United States,\u2019\u201d Karen DeYoung reports. \u201cBut beyond Afghanistan, he said, overall U.S.-Russia relations are in a \u2018deplorable state,\u2019 which he attributed largely to U.S. withdrawal from multilateral arms control treaties and refusal to extend or seriously renegotiate the bilateral New START nuclear arms reduction treaty that expires in February. \u2026 While he characterized conversations between Putin and Trump, including five telephone calls in late March and April, as constructive, Antonov said that \u2018unfortunately, it is not always possible to implement in practice the constructive tone of the presidents\u2019 talks.\u2019\u201dThe FBI is investigating exiled Chinese businessman Guo Wengui, including his work with Steve Bannon.\u201cFBI national security agents in recent months have asked people who know both men for information on Mr. Guo\u2019s activities, including the source of funds of a media company linked to him that hired Mr. Bannon in 2018 as a consultant, the people said,\u201d the WSJ reports. \u201cThe probe has been under way for more than six months, and prosecutors from the U.S. Attorney\u2019s offices in Manhattan and Brooklyn have been involved, some of the people said. The purpose of the FBI\u2019s interests couldn\u2019t be determined. \u2026 Mr. Guo, a former property tycoon in China, in 2014 fled the country, where he is accused of wrongdoing including bribery, fraud, money laundering, kidnapping and rape\u2014allegations he has denied. He also has applied for asylum in the U.S.\u201dFacebook closed a network of accounts and pages affiliated with Roger Stone.\u201cFacebook took down a network of more than 100 pages and accounts on Wednesday it said was affiliated with felon and former Republican operative Roger Stone for \u2018coordinated inauthentic behavior,\u2019 taking the company\u2019s campaign against disinformation closer to the heart of the nation\u2019s political establishment,\u201d Craig Timberg and Isaac Stanley-Becker report. \u201cThe offending activity on Facebook and its subsidiary Instagram dated as far back as 2015 but was particularly active during the 2016 presidential election season, when Stone was advising Trump\u2019s presidential campaign, and in 2017, as federal investigators were scrutinizing his activities.\u201dDivided AmericaGeorge Floyd told police that he thought he would die because he couldn\u2019t breathe.\u00a0\u201cFloyd repeatedly begged police officers not to shoot him and complained of being claustrophobic as they tried to place him in a squad car in the minutes before he was killed on a South Minneapolis street corner in May, according to transcripts of police body camera footage from the scene released Wednesday,\u201d Holly Bailey reports. \u201cThe transcripts make clear that Floyd was trying to cooperate with police but was deathly afraid of them, at times telling them that he had had covid-19 and was worried that he was going to die because he couldn\u2019t breathe while in their custody. As one of the officers \u2014 Derek Chauvin \u2014 pressed a knee into his neck and held Floyd on the ground, he told Floyd that he must be okay because he was able to speak, saying that he was using up a lot of oxygen pleading for help. \u2018They going to kill me,\u2019 Floyd said as officers sat atop him in the street. \u2026 Floyd went lifeless minutes later and was pronounced dead.\u201cThe newly disclosed transcripts of audio from body cameras worn by J. Alexander Kueng and Thomas K. Lane, two of the four former Minneapolis police officers charged in Floyd\u2019s killing, were disclosed in court Wednesday as Lane\u2019s attorney sought to have charges against his client dismissed, arguing that there is not enough evidence that he committed a crime. Lane, according to the transcripts, appeared to ask Chauvin \u2014 the most senior officer at the scene \u2014 whether they should reposition Floyd. Chauvin, according to the transcripts, declined \u2026 Transcripts show that Lane approached the car and called on Floyd at least five times to show his hands, drawing his gun when he didn\u2019t. \u2018I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m sorry,\u2019 Floyd responded, according to a transcript of Lane\u2019s body camera. \u2026\u00a0\u201cAs Lane asked him to step out of the car, Floyd apologized several times and repeatedly asked the officer not to shoot him. \u2026 The transcripts show that Floyd continued to ask officers not to shoot him as he stepped from his vehicle, and suggest that he struggled with officers as they tried to handcuff him. \u2026 Lane asked [witness Shawanda Renee] Hill about Floyd\u2019s behavior \u2026 \u2018He\u2019s been shot before,\u2019 Hill said. \u2026 According to the transcript of footage from Kueng\u2019s body camera, the officer sat Floyd down on a sidewalk and explained that he was being detained for suspicion of passing fake U.S. currency.

He wants schools to be fully open in the fall. He wants a Republican convention next month to be as normal as possible. So far, the public isn\u2019t buying.The president has the bully pulpit but the public is looking at what\u2019s happening around them.\u00a0About half of states are recording increases in the number of cases of covid-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. In some places, the increases have been dramatic. State and local leaders have been forced to reverse course on previous efforts to reopen businesses.Attitudes are shifting almost as dramatically as the spread of the disease.\u00a0Recent Gallup polling, reported by the organization\u2019s Jeffrey M. Jones, tells the story. More people now say the situation with the virus is getting worse than at any time during the pandemic and expectations about how long the disruption might last are shifting as well. The changes are not at the margins.ADADIn early June, 47 percent said the virus situation was getting a little or a lot better, while 30 percent said it was getting a little or a lot worse. (The rest said it was staying the same.) By the end of June, the numbers had flipped, with 23 percent saying the situation was a little or a lot better and 65 percent saying it was a little or a lot worse. In a month, there was a 35-point spike in the percentage of people saying things were getting worse.The previous high point of those saying things were getting worse was in early April, when 56 percent said that. Through most of the spring and early summer, the percentage saying things were getting worse hovered around 42 percent.As the disease spreads, Americans are recalibrating their expectations about the future. In the late June survey, 74 percent said they now expect disruption of their lives due to the disease to last until the end of this year or longer. That group is split evenly between those who expect things to return closer to normal by year\u2019s end and those who say it will be at least sometime in 2021 before that happens.ADADIn early June, 54 percent said they thought the disruptions would last to the end of the year or beyond. That means during the month of June, there was a 20-point jump in the direction of pessimism about the lasting effects of the pandemic.As with all such polling, there are significant partisan differences in the way people see things.While 90 percent of Democrats said things are getting worse, just 28 percent of Republicans held that view. Among independents, 63 percent said the situation is getting worse.But the trendlines all moved in unison toward more concern. In the week between June 21 and June 28, there was a 15-point rise among Democrats, an 18-point jump among independents and an 8-point increase among Republicans.ADMore people are worried about getting covid-19. Currently, 56 percent say they are worried, which is just 1 point below the peak of concern back in April and a rise of 9 points since early June.People are more cautious about going out in public. In one week, the percentage who said even healthy people with no symptoms should stay at home as much as possible rose 6 points, from 66 percent to 72 percent. That compares with 28 percent who said that healthy people should try to lead their lives as normally as possible.Trump\u2019s latest initiative is to encourage schools to open up this fall.\u00a0He pressed the idea on Tuesday and on Wednesday morning tweeted his displeasure with the guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, calling them \u201cvery tough and expensive.\u201d He said the CDC was asking schools to do \u201cvery impractical things,\u201d adding, \u201cI will be meeting with them!!!\u201d A few hours later, Vice President Pence said the CDC will soon reissue school guidance. Yet on Thursday morning, CDC Director Robert Redfield said on ABC's \u201cGood Morning America\u201d that the guidelines won't be revised, but \u201cwe are going to provide additional reference documents.\u201dADADThat continues a pattern of the president disagreeing with the scientists and institutions tasked with public health and attempting to jawbone them into taking a different position. But there is now a track record of what can happen when states and cities ignore guidelines.Some of the states that moved fastest to reopen their economies \u2014 \u00a0in many cases paying minimal attention to the government\u2019s guidelines on when and how to reopen \u2014 \u00a0have since seen enormous increases in coronavirus cases. Among them are Texas, Arizona and Florida.The issue of school reopening is enormously difficult. School administrators are weighing the health risks to students, their families and their communities of fully returning to schools this fall against the long-term damage to young people who could fall behind academically and in their social development if they are not back in the classroom. That is especially the case for elementary and secondary students without access to fast Internet, good computers and parents who can spend time helping with remote learning.ADADColleges and universities are weighing the same issues, as well as the economic costs to their institutions of lost tuition money if they aren\u2019t providing a learning environment attractive to students. On a cautionary note, there is some evidence there are clear risks of having thousands of young people gathered on campuses, studying and partying as they are likely to do.Trump prefers to be a cheerleader, painting rhetorically with a broad brush that pushes aside the complications that come with all these decisions. The reason is obvious. He wants to return to the pre-pandemic America, a country with a vibrant economy, which he sought as the foundation of his reelection campaign.Instead, reality continues to get in his way. Trump can say what he does, but people are drawing their own conclusions \u2014 about the state of the coronavirus crisis, the risks they face personally and how to continually adjust their behavior.ADADUntil the spread begins to decline widely, most Americans are likely to be cautious. They will not be looking to the president to make that judgment for them.Quote of the day\u201cA lot people thought once the alarm was sounded back in March surely the federal government would fix this, but that hasn\u2019t happened,\u201d said Deborah Burger, a California nurse and the president of National Nurses United. (William Wan)\u00a0More on the coronavirusHospitals across the Sun Belt are strained.\u00a0\u201cIn pandemic hotspot states such as Florida, Arizona, California and Texas, hospitals are adding new intensive care unit beds and special air-flow systems to treat the growing demand as virus hospitalizations set records almost daily. To cope with the wave of patients, hospitals are canceling elective surgeries to free up space for those sick with the virus. Medical staff warn they could become overwhelmed,\u201d Chelsea Janes, Isaac Stanley-Becker, Lenny Bernstein and Joshua Partlow report. \u201cThe United States passed the 3 million case mark on Wednesday, and more than 129,000 people have died. Florida is rushing some 100 new health-care workers to \u00adMiami-Dade County\u2019s public hospital network to handle the influx of coronavirus cases, including 75 nurses who will be ready to work in intensive care units. \u2026 Texas on Wednesday reported 98 deaths from covid-19, a one-day high that surpassed its earlier record reached on Tuesday, when Arizona and Mississippi also reached one-day highs. Arizona and Texas also hit new highs this week in seven-day rolling averages of deaths. \u2026 About 45 percent of the Texas Medical Center\u2019s 1,364 intensive care unit beds are now filled with coronavirus patients. \u2026 Hospitals are also feeling the strain in Los Angeles County, which is averaging around 2,300 new cases each day.\"The country is running short on masks, gowns and gloves. Again.\u00a0\u201cNurses say they are reusing N95 masks for days and even weeks at a time. Doctors say they can\u2019t reopen offices because they lack personal protective equipment. State officials say they have scoured U.S. and international suppliers for PPE and struggle to get orders filled. Experts worry the problem could worsen as coronavirus infections climb, straining medical systems,\u201d William Wan reports. \u201cIn interviews, White House officials said concerns over PPE shortages are overblown. They said U.S. manufacturing and stockpiles of protective equipment have improved dramatically and are adequate in most states. \u2026 Demand for protective equipment has soared, but unlike in March, when efforts focused on getting PPE for major hospitals \u2026 supplies now are desperately needed by primary care offices, nursing homes, prisons and psychiatric and disability facilities.\u201dTrump\u2019s Tulsa rally is \u201clikely\u201d the source of a virus surge.Tulsa City-County Health Department Director Bruce Dart said the rally \u201clikely contributed\u201d to a dramatic surge in new cases, the AP reports. \u201cTulsa County reported 261 confirmed new cases on Monday, a one-day record high, and another 206 cases on Tuesday. By comparison, during the week before the June 20 Trump rally, there were 76 cases on Monday and 96 on Tuesday. Although the health department\u2019s policy is to not publicly identify individual settings where people may have contracted the virus, Dart said those large gatherings \u2018more than likely\u2019 contributed to the spike.\u201d\u00a0ADADA rapidly growing number of Houston-area residents are dying at home, according to an NBC News and ProPublica investigation. A growing number of these at-home deaths have been linked to covid-19.A Texas GOP convention originally scheduled to be held next week in Houston has been canceled,\u00a0Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner (D) said. \"These are some very serious times,\" Turner said. \"Simply, the public health concerns outweighed anything else.\" (Texas Tribune)But, but, but: Trump is heading to Odessa, Tex., later this month for a fundraiser.\u00a0The invite to the event, shared by the Tribune\u2019s Patrick Svitek, doesn\u2019t specify where in the city the fundraiser will be held, but tickets range from $2,800 to $100,000.Disney World will reopen on Saturday, despite Florida\u2019s worsening outbreak. Disney says that instituting an aggressive cleaning schedule and slew of new health protocols while dramatically cutting down on the visitors allowed means that it can open safely. (Antonia Farzan)Bar crowds and large parties are driving new infections in Louisiana, officials said, leading New Orleans to re-tighten its regulations on indoor gatherings.

The number of students testing positive has more than tripled in the past week, with 47 new cases reported. (Antonia Farzan)Three dozen people connected to the Mississippi state legislature have tested positive, including 26 lawmakers. (Katie Shepherd)At least 82 cases have been linked to a Missouri summer camp. Kanakuk, which operates several Christian sleepaway camps in the state, shut down its K-2 camp for teenagers by July 2, when 41 campers and employees tested positive. (Antonia Farzan)The daily influx of new cases increased slightly in the D.C. region, with hospitalizations rising in Virginia for the second consecutive day. (Dana Hedgpeth, Julie Zauzmer and Erin Cox)Trump wants schools to reopen. But school officials are pushing against it.\u00a0School officials across the country have concluded they cannot fully reopen while following new CDC guidance that recommends that students be kept six feet apart to prevent spreading the virus, because classrooms are too small to accommodate all students with the recommended distancing, Laura Meckler reports. \u201cThe administration is finding it nearly impossible to control the situation, with the president\u2019s views often at odds with those of his health advisers \u2026 On Wednesday, New York City schools, the nation\u2019s largest school system, announced a plan that will have most students in school two days a week and learning from home the other three. Many other systems have announced or are considering similar plans. \u2026. Trump \u2026 ended with a nebulous threat: \u2018May cut off funding if not open!\u2019 Trump has no power to cut federal funding already allocated to states and districts, but the vice president suggested the administration would seek to tie any future aid to opening of schools.\"Harvard and MIT sued the Trump administration to protect international students.\u00a0\u201cThe\u00a0lawsuit\u00a0represented a swift response to\u00a0an unexpected order issued this week by the federal government, as universities rush to protect the status of thousands of international students. It also marks a new battle line in the war between Trump and education leaders over how to safely reopen schools in the midst of his reelection bid,\u201d Susan Svrluga and Nick Anderson report. \u201cIn their lawsuit, the universities argue that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement\u2019s decision was designed to force universities to conduct in-person classes, part of an apparent political strategy from the Trump administration to pressure schools, from kindergarten to graduate school, to fully reopen this fall, even as virus cases soar. \u2026 The lawsuit cites remarks from acting deputy secretary of homeland security Ken Cuccinelli on Tuesday, in which he said the directive \u2018will \u2026 encourage schools to reopen.\u2019\u201d\u00a0Retail workers are caught in the latest culture war: Getting customers to wear face masks.\u00a0\u201cMixed messaging and politicization have turned a public health safeguard into a lightning-rod issue. As a result, workers have been berated, even assaulted, by aggressive anti-maskers,\u201d Abha Bhattarai reports. \u201cSome workers say they have been told they cannot refuse service to maskless customers, even if local laws require it. Others feel they\u2019ve been put in the awkward and sometimes dangerous position of confronting shoppers who refuse to wear the coverings. In recent weeks, retail workers have been punched in the face, suffered broken limbs and, in the case of\u00a0a security guard at a Family Dollar\u00a0store in Michigan, killed while trying to enforce mask requirements.\u201d\u00a0ADADThe head of the TSA ordered new covid-19 safety precautions after meeting with a whistleblower who said the agency wasn\u2019t doing enough.\u00a0\u201cThe new measures require officers to wear eye protection when they are in close contact with travelers and aren\u2019t protected by a plastic screen, the attorney said. Officers must also change their gloves or sanitize them after patting down passengers, handling identification documents or checking in luggage,\u201d Ian Duncan reports. \u00a0United Airlines warned that it may furlough 36,000 of its employees, almost half of its U.S. workforce. (WSJ)On some planes, some rows are kept empty even as passengers are crowded together.\u00a0On an American Airlines flight, \u201cJoy Gonzalez, an aviation engineer based in Seattle, found herself seated at a window with two older passengers beside her in the middle and aisle seats. In order to gain more social distance, she and the aisle passenger both moved to seats behind them where two rows were empty. But before takeoff, a flight attendant ordered them back to their assigned seats, telling them they had not paid for those exit row seats, which are more expensive,\u201d the Times reports. \u201cAirlines vowed to bring social distancing to the air \u2026 by reducing capacity and blocking many middle seats. Now as air travel builds, freeing up that kind of space is plainly at odds with the airlines\u2019 profit motive, and passengers are finding they may be confined to a cramped seat if they don\u2019t pay for a premium one.\u201d\u00a0ADThings you can no longer do in Japan's theme parks: scream.\u00a0\u201cPlease scream inside your heart,\u201d said two theme park executives in an informational video shown to guests in Japan, the WSJ reports. \u201cFrom Fujiyama to Tokyo DisneySea\u2019s Tower of Terror, Japan\u2019s campaign against the coronavirus is targeting thrill-seekers who might expel a burst of virus-carrying droplets with a mid-ride utterance. Enjoy the ride, say theme-park operators\u2014just don\u2019t let your voice show it.\u201d\u00a0Conservative lawmakers and groups who criticize increased government spending benefited from an aid program.\u00a0\u201cConservative members of Congress and advocacy groups that ardently criticize excessive government spending were among those accepting small-business pandemic relief funds from the Treasury this year, according to data released Monday. Americans for Tax Reform Foundation, led by firebrand anti-tax advocate Grover Norquist, took a loan between $150,000 and $350,000 from the Paycheck Protection Program. The Ayn Rand Institute and Citizens against Government Waste likewise accepted loans funded by the program,\u201d Tom Hamburger, Aaron Gregg and Anu Narayanswamy report. \u201cAmericans for Tax Reform Foundation is one of two related tax revision groups led by Norquist, who famously said: \u2018I don\u2019t want to abolish government. I simply want to reduce it to the size where I can drag it into the bathroom and drown it in the bathtub.\u2019\u201dAlmost one-third of U.S. households missed their July housing payments.\u00a0Thirty-two percent of households haven\u2019t made their full July payments yet, CNBC reports. That makes July the fourth month in a row that a \u201chistorically high\u201d number of households were unable to pay their housing bill on time and in full, up from 30 percent in June.\u00a0The Trump presidencyThe Supreme Court said employers can opt out of Obamacare\u2019s birth control mandate over religious objections.\u201cThe decision greatly expands the ability of employers to claim the exception, and the government estimates that between 70,000 and 126,000 women could lose access to cost-free birth control as a result,\u201d Robert Barnes reports. \u201cThe contraceptive case involves a long-running dispute over Obamacare, as the ACA is known, and a requirement that employers provide cost-free birth control for female employees. The law itself doesn\u2019t specify the rules, leaving it to federal agencies to determine how contraceptives fit into the mandate for cost-free \u2018preventive care and screenings.\u2019 The Obama administration required contraceptives and had narrower exceptions for churches and other houses of worship. \u2026 The Trump administration moved in 2018 to expand the types of organizations that could opt out to include religious groups and nonreligious employers with moral and religious objections. \u2026\u00a0\u201cThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the 3rd Circuit had put the Trump administration exemptions on hold, and said the agencies didn\u2019t have the broad authority to grant them. Justice Clarence Thomas, who wrote the majority opinion, said that was wrong. \u2026 Liberal Justices Elena Kagan and Stephen G. Breyer agreed with the court\u2019s conservatives that the administration had the right to create an exemption, but they said lower courts should examine whether the administration\u2019s rules were \u2018consistent with reasoned judgment.\u2019 Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg issued a blistering dissent, in which she said her colleagues had gone too far to appease religious conservatives.\u201dThe Court also gave religious organizations the ability to hire and fire without offending some anti-discrimination laws.\u201cIn a 7-to-2 decision, the court strengthened the \u2018ministerial exception\u2019 it found in 2012 that protects religious organizations from some employment lawsuits. It said two teachers at parochial schools who wanted to contest their firings in court were the kinds of employees who were covered by the exception and thus unable to sue. It indicated that those involved in almost any kind of religious instruction would be considered \u2018ministers\u2019 of the faith, no matter their official title or even if they practiced the faith themselves,\u201d Robert Barnes reports. \u201cJustices Sonia Sotomayor and Ginsburg dissented, saying the decision gave religious employers \u2018free rein to discriminate.\u2019 \u2026 Breyer and Kagan, usually part of the court\u2019s liberal bloc, voted with the majority.\u201dThe Supreme Court\u2019s decisions will conclude today with what could be a blockbuster decision on whether Trump may shield his private financial records and tax returns from congressional committees and a New York prosecutor.As the economy reels from the pandemic, Trump and Mexico\u2019s L\u00f3pez Obrador mark the start of a trade pact.\u00a0\u201cTrump marked the start of a three-nation regional trade deal in a Rose Garden ceremony with Mexican President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador,\u201d David Nakamura and David Lynch report. \u201cThe two populist-leaning presidents, from opposite ends of the political spectrum, signed a joint proclamation hailing the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement \u2026 Trump thanked his counterpart for responding to U.S. pressure to help curb a major spike in unauthorized immigration last year \u2026 L\u00f3pez Obrador responded that Trump has \u2018honored our position as an independent nation\u2019 and \u2018behaved with kindness and respect.\u2019 The positive comments from the two leaders on Wednesday were striking when compared with the tensions between the neighboring countries in recent years.\"The Russian ambassador said reports of a bounty program to kill U.S. soldiers are a \u201cdownright lie.\u201d\u201c\u2018No concrete evidence has been presented\u2019 of allegations that a Russian military intelligence unit offered to pay Taliban-linked militants to target American and other coalition forces, Anatoly Antonov said. Authors of the reports are \u2018trying to create an impression that our country is an enemy of the United States,\u2019\u201d Karen DeYoung reports. \u201cBut beyond Afghanistan, he said, overall U.S.-Russia relations are in a \u2018deplorable state,\u2019 which he attributed largely to U.S. withdrawal from multilateral arms control treaties and refusal to extend or seriously renegotiate the bilateral New START nuclear arms reduction treaty that expires in February. \u2026 While he characterized conversations between Putin and Trump, including five telephone calls in late March and April, as constructive, Antonov said that \u2018unfortunately, it is not always possible to implement in practice the constructive tone of the presidents\u2019 talks.\u2019\u201dThe FBI is investigating exiled Chinese businessman Guo Wengui, including his work with Steve Bannon.\u201cFBI national security agents in recent months have asked people who know both men for information on Mr. Guo\u2019s activities, including the source of funds of a media company linked to him that hired Mr. Bannon in 2018 as a consultant, the people said,\u201d the WSJ reports. \u201cThe probe has been under way for more than six months, and prosecutors from the U.S. Attorney\u2019s offices in Manhattan and Brooklyn have been involved, some of the people said. The purpose of the FBI\u2019s interests couldn\u2019t be determined. \u2026 Mr. Guo, a former property tycoon in China, in 2014 fled the country, where he is accused of wrongdoing including bribery, fraud, money laundering, kidnapping and rape\u2014allegations he has denied. He also has applied for asylum in the U.S.\u201dFacebook closed a network of accounts and pages affiliated with Roger Stone.\u201cFacebook took down a network of more than 100 pages and accounts on Wednesday it said was affiliated with felon and former Republican operative Roger Stone for \u2018coordinated inauthentic behavior,\u2019 taking the company\u2019s campaign against disinformation closer to the heart of the nation\u2019s political establishment,\u201d Craig Timberg and Isaac Stanley-Becker report. \u201cThe offending activity on Facebook and its subsidiary Instagram dated as far back as 2015 but was particularly active during the 2016 presidential election season, when Stone was advising Trump\u2019s presidential campaign, and in 2017, as federal investigators were scrutinizing his activities.\u201dDivided AmericaGeorge Floyd told police that he thought he would die because he couldn\u2019t breathe.\u00a0\u201cFloyd repeatedly begged police officers not to shoot him and complained of being claustrophobic as they tried to place him in a squad car in the minutes before he was killed on a South Minneapolis street corner in May, according to transcripts of police body camera footage from the scene released Wednesday,\u201d Holly Bailey reports. \u201cThe transcripts make clear that Floyd was trying to cooperate with police but was deathly afraid of them, at times telling them that he had had covid-19 and was worried that he was going to die because he couldn\u2019t breathe while in their custody. As one of the officers \u2014 Derek Chauvin \u2014 pressed a knee into his neck and held Floyd on the ground, he told Floyd that he must be okay because he was able to speak, saying that he was using up a lot of oxygen pleading for help. \u2018They going to kill me,\u2019 Floyd said as officers sat atop him in the street. \u2026 Floyd went lifeless minutes later and was pronounced dead.\u201cThe newly disclosed transcripts of audio from body cameras worn by J. Alexander Kueng and Thomas K. Lane, two of the four former Minneapolis police officers charged in Floyd\u2019s killing, were disclosed in court Wednesday as Lane\u2019s attorney sought to have charges against his client dismissed, arguing that there is not enough evidence that he committed a crime.

Thousands of banks are eligible to sign up and have been able to register since mid-June. But last week, Fed Chair Jerome H. Powell said only about 300 had registered, including firms making loans solely to existing customers, for which there is no public list. Meanwhile, businesses eager for loans have said they\u2019re hard-pressed to find banks that will issue them.\u201dCoronavirus falloutFrom the U.S.:U.S. added a record 4.8 million jobs in June, but a spike in cases could spoil that momentum: \u201cTwo key federal measurements showed the precarious place the economy finds itself in \u2026 The unemployment rate in June was 11.1 percent, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said, down from a peak of 14.7 percent in April but still far above the 3.5 percent level notched in February.

Subscribe today.arrow-rightNearly 3\u00bd years later, in the president\u2019s telling, the carnage is still underway but this time the enemy is closer to home \u2014 other Americans whose racial identity and cultural beliefs are toppling the nation\u2019s heritage and founding ideals.Trump\u2019s dark and divisive 42-minute speech at the foot of Mount Rushmore in South Dakota late Friday served as a clarion for his campaign reelection message at a time when the nation \u2014 already reeling with deep anxiety over the devastating public health and economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic \u2014 is also facing a cultural reckoning over the residue of its racially segregated past.ADADAs he has so often during his tenure, the president made clear that he will do little to try to heal or unify the country ahead of the November presidential election but rather aims to drive a deeper wedge into the country\u2019s fractures.For Trump, that has meant defining a new foil. If his 2016 campaign to put \u201cAmerica first\u201d was focused on building a wall to keep out immigrants and shedding alliances with nations he believed were exploiting the United States, the president is now aiming his rhetorical blasts at groups of liberal Americans who, he believes, constitute a direct threat to the standing of his conservative base.At Mount Rushmore, under the granite gaze of four U.S. presidents, Trump railed against \u201cangry mobs\u201d pursuing \u201cfar-left fascism\u201d and a \u201cleft-wing cultural revolution\u201d that has manifested in the assault on statues and monuments celebrating Confederate leaders and other U.S. historical figures, including some former presidents, amid the mass racial justice protests of recent weeks.ADAD\u201cTheir goal is not a better America; their goal is the end of America,\u201d the president declared.\u201cWe are now in the process of defeating the radical left \u2014 the Marxists, the anarchists, the agitators, the looters,\u201d Trump told guests Saturday during an Independence Day celebration on the South Lawn of the White House.In making the case that a radical and violent ideology underpins much of the social justice movement that propelled the nationwide demonstrations, Trump has dropped virtually all pretense that he supports millions of peaceful protesters who have called for broad reforms to address what they see as systemic racism and a culture of brutality in police departments.ADTrump made no mention Friday of the victims of police violence, including more than half a dozen black families he met with in the Oval Office last month before he signed an executive order to create national training certification guidelines for law enforcement agencies and establish a database to track police brutality cases.ADInstead, he warned of a \u201cgrowing danger\u201d to the values of the nation\u2019s founders \u2014  a \u201cmerciless campaign to wipe out our history, defame our heroes, erase our values, and indoctrinate our children.\u201dHe boasted of federal authorities apprehending hundreds of looters and vandals, even though the number is lower. He warned of \u201cviolent mayhem\u201d in streets of cities run by \u201cliberal Democrats.\u201d He celebrated the arrest of a \u201cringleader\u201d in the unsuccessful attempt from demonstrators to topple a statue of President Andrew Jackson, Trump\u2019s favorite past president, in Lafayette Square across from the White House. And he asserted that schoolchildren were being taught to \u201chate their own country.\u201dAD\u201cThis was a deeply divisive speech aimed at what Trump sees as real Americans versus anarchists,\u201d presidential historian Douglas Brinkley said. \u201cThat\u2019s not just bigotry to the outside world, but now he\u2019s really attacking millions of Americans as worthless, as socialists, as anarchists.\u201dADTrump\u2019s 2016 campaign was built around the core policy goals of restricting immigration \u2014  in the name of providing more jobs to Americans and reducing crime \u2014 and renegotiating global trade deals in the service of protecting American workers. In his inaugural address in January 2017, the president faulted Washington\u2019s political elite for enriching themselves at the expense of the public at large, ignoring blight and suffering caused by their policies that favored rampant globalization.\u201cThis American carnage stops right here and stops right now,\u201d Trump said.ADTrump exploited the nation\u2019s culture wars after taking office, lambasting African American athletes for kneeling during the national anthem in protest of police brutality and failing to clearly denounce a white supremacist march in Charlottesville that resulted in the death of a counterprotester.ADBut heading into 2020, the president who had promised to \u201cmake America great again\u201d was preparing to run for reelection on a message of economic renewal, touting record stock markets and historically low unemployment rates. He was pointing to the construction of 200 miles of new barrier walls along the U.S.-Mexico border and renegotiated trade deals with Canada, Mexico and China as evidence that he had made good on his 2016 promises.The Trump campaign began rolling out a new motto: \u201cKeep America Great.\u201dADHis mismanagement of the coronavirus pandemic upended those plans. Nearly 130,000 Americans have died of the virus and tens of millions have lost their jobs, and despite a six-week shutdown in wide swaths of the country, infection rates this past week spiked to a record high of more than 50,000 new cases per day.ADTrump\u2019s public approval ratings have tumbled over his response to the pandemic and the racial justice protests. Polls show former vice president Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, opening a sizable lead over Trump nationally and holding an advantage in key swing states.In an effort to halt his slide, Trump has sought to shift blame for scenes of violence and destruction at the protests onto leaders in Democrat-led cities and states, accusing them of losing control of their streets and failing to act with toughness.ADAt Mount Rushmore, Trump appeared to make an oblique reference to Biden after touting the legacies of George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln and Theodore Roosevelt, the presidents carved into the cliffs above him.\u201cNo movement that seeks to dismantle these treasured American legacies can possibly have a love of America at its heart,\u201d Trump said. \u201cNo person who remains quiet at the destruction of this resplendent heritage can possibly lead us to a better future.\u201dADIn a video message Saturday, Biden offered a more hopeful contrast to Trump by casting the racial justice protests of recent weeks as part of the nation\u2019s long-standing struggle \u201cbetween two parts of our character \u2014 the idea that all men and women, all people, are created equal, and the racism that has torn us apart.\u201dAD\u201cAmerican history is no fairy tale,\u201d added Biden, who cited George Floyd, the black man whose death at the hands of Minneapolis police in late May sparked the national outcry.Peter Wehner, who served as a speechwriter for president George W. Bush, said Trump faces an obvious difficulty as he seeks to fan public fears over renewed \u201cAmerican carnage\u201d given that he has been responsible for the stewardship of the country for more than three years.\u201cIt\u2019s an insight into him: He doesn\u2019t view his job in terms of governing. He just views it as a platform to vent and be angry,\u201d Wehner said. \u201cHe\u2019s not just appealing to the base, but he\u2019s appealing to the base of the base. The aperture of the campaign is constricting, not expanding \u2014 he\u2019s energizing a smaller and smaller group of angrier and angrier Americans. And to try to energize that base, he has to say more and more extreme things.\u201d\n\n", "comment": "4.5k Comments", "topic": "Politics"}, {"cover": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/L7OHNBGCD4I6VCIINCRLT2XJ4A.jpghttps://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/L7OHNBGCD4I6VCIINCRLT2XJ4A.jpg", "title": "Joe Biden just ate Trump\u2019s populist lunch", "date": "Jul 10, 2020", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/07/10/biden-just-ate-trumps-populist-lunch/", "keyword": "presidential election and trade war", "website": "the Washington Post", "author": "Jennifer Rubin", "content": "Had President Trump followed a truly populist economic program \u2014 forgoing tax cuts for the rich, passing an infrastructure bill, refraining from trying to take health care away from millions of Americans \u2014 he might have improved his standing with voters (before the coronavirus calamity) and boxed out Democrats who have always done best when pitching a bread-and-butter economic message to blue-collar voters.

The Biden plan includes \u201c$400 billion to purchase products and materials our country needs to modernize our infrastructure, to replenish our critical stockpiles, and to enhance our national security.\u201d The plan also promises to fight unfair trading practices; fund green energy jobs; invest $300 billion in research in new technologies (thereby \u201ccreating millions of good-paying union jobs\u201d); support a caregiving and education workforce (e.g., paid sick leave, child care); add more money for education; and secure the Affordable Care Act (e.g., lowering the cost of prescription drugs, stopping surprise medical bills and providing a public option to cover the millions of Americans without care). Finally, he vowed to present a complete agenda for rectifying racial inequality.Sign up for The Odds newsletter for election updates from data columnist David BylerIt remains to be seen whether he will have more success than previous presidents in boosting manufacturing, which is becoming a smaller sector of the economy and creates fewer jobs than during the 1950s and 1960s. Nevertheless, this is a robust, progressive agenda that throws in some nationalistic language (American jobs!) but is not overtly protectionist nor inward looking. (The most he would promise is that he would \u201cstand up to the Chinese government\u2019s abuses, insist on fair trade, and extend opportunity to all Americans.\u201d) However, it is far from the \u201csocialist\u201d moniker Trump wants to affix to him. There is no indictment of capitalism, no Medicare-for-all and no invocation of a \u201cGreen New Deal.\u201d This is precisely the sort of center-left agenda Biden is known for. Conspicuously absent is one measure that would greatly improve productivity and innovation: expansion and reform of legal immigration. At least for now, he is not going to give Trump a hook to claim he is an \u201copen borders\u201d extremist.Biden, whose staff consulted with Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), managed (apparently) to satisfy the left wing of his party without putting forth something that will scare the rest of the electorate. Generally, this is how every winning Democratic candidate since World War II has campaigned. It has been good politics to run on an active federal government working for the little guy \u2014 especially when your opponent has been rewarding the super-rich and corporations.Watch Opinions videos:Read more:Greg Sargent: Joe Biden flips the script on TrumpGeorge F.
