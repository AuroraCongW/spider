China says Tibet has been its territory for centuries.For China, the loss of its mission in Houston dims its view of America\u2019s South and, according to U.S. officials, removes the nerve center of a Chinese spying network.ADWhile the impact of the consulate closures has yet to be fully felt by either side, it will be.AD\u201cWe\u2019ll be flying blind if not with very dark glasses and so will they,\u201d said Beatrice Camp, a retired career diplomat who served as consul general at the U.S. consulate in Shanghai from 2008 to 2011.The closures of the consulates up the ante in the diplomatic confrontation, with the Trump administration turning up the heat on China in the midst of an already heated rivalry that has been exacerbated by the coronavirus pandemic and ahead of the November U.S. presidential election \u2014 and Beijing responding in kind.As President Donald Trump, under fire for his response to the pandemic, points to China as the culprit, neither side appears willing to back down. Although a calm of sorts has descended in recent days with no new actions or retaliation announced, U.S. officials say more is coming.AD\u201cIt\u2019s extremely aggressive, extremely belligerent and I don\u2019t know what the goal is or where this is supposed to take us,\u201d said Camp, noting that cooperation and exchanges in the fields of agriculture, energy, aviation, the environment and commercial and cultural exchanges will suffer.ADIn addition to serving as service centers for visa seekers and Chinese and American citizens in need of assistance in each city, the consulates provided a safe and secure headquarters for intelligence collection and political reporting.In Houston, U.S. officials said they removed the epicenter of a Chinese spying network that spanned more than 25 cities, collecting intelligence, trying to steal intellectual property and harassing the expatriate families of dissidents and others while trying to coerce them to return to China.ADLed by a consul general who had previously served in Australia, where China has been especially active in going after expatriates, the Houston consulate was \u201cparticularly aggressive and particularly successful,\u201d one U.S. official said.U.S. officials do not deny collecting intelligence from the consulate in Chengdu but insist that it functioned the same as any diplomatic mission run by the United States or other nations.ADA second U.S. official, who like the first was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity, said Chengdu was important for \u201cunderstanding and messaging the Chinese people and especially the people in that district, which includes Tibet.\u201dADBut the officials said that those efforts were hamstrung by Chinese regulations and that China enjoyed far greater access from its Houston consulate than U.S. diplomats did in Chengdu.The U.S. has had a consulate in Chengdu for 35 years, but its presence in southwest China predates that. During World War II, American planes airlifted supplies to Chinese troops in the area from bases in India and Burma, now called Myanmar, in a drive to hold back the Japanese advance.For many years, it was the lone foreign consulate in Chengdu, with other nations forced to locate diplomatic missions in Chonqqing, a mega-city that is home to major U.S. and other Western commercial interests. The Chengdu consulate had also overseen U.S. interests in the provinces of Yunnan and Guizhou.ADADChengdu is also a jumping-off point for visits to Tibet, access to which has long been restricted for foreigners, particularly since an uprising against Beijing\u2019s rule in 2008. China says Tibet has been its territory for seven centuries, but many Tibetans say they were effectively independent for most of that time.Tibet\u2019s Buddhist spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, fled to India in 1959 amid an uprising against Chinese rule, and Beijing has refused dialogue with his self-declared government in exile.China and India still contest the high-mountain border between the sides, and their forces engaged in clashes this summer that left 20 Indian troops dead. China has not disclosed its casualty count.ADPrior to the fighting, the U.S. ambassador to Beijing, Terry Branstad, visited Tibet last year and urged Beijing to undertake substantive dialogue with the Dalai Lama  and refrain from interfering in religious practices.ADAs the capital of Sichuan province, with a population of more than 81 million people, Chengdu looms large in China\u2019s economy, playing a major role in industries from aviation to pharmaceuticals and agricultural products.With the Houston consulate\u2019s closing, American citizens and Chinese seeking visas or wishing to manage business in the U.S. will have to travel to the embassy in Beijing or to consulates along the East Coast.

Subscribe today.arrow-rightChina immediately promised to retaliate for the \"unprecedented escalation,\" raising the specter of a tit-for-tat battle that could prompt Beijing to shutter at least one U.S. consulate soon and adopt more punitive measures later.One potential target is the U.S. Consulate in Wuhan, which closed after the coronavirus epidemic began spreading across the city in January. The diplomatic missions in Wuhan and Houston are considered \"sister\" consulates.ADThe acrimony between Washington and Beijing has been growing for months, but it was not immediately clear why the United States decided to order the Houston consulate closed now.ADThe consulate was notified of the order early Tuesday, according to a former senior U.S. official with knowledge of the situation. U.S. agents monitoring the consulate observed personnel going to a Home Depot to buy barrels, which they used to burn documents, the former official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the matter\u2019s sensitivity.\u201cThe Houston consulate is well known across the U.S. intelligence and law enforcement community for its malign activities,\u201d the official said.ADThe out-of-a-spy-novel confrontation  widens a conflict that already has spanned trade and technology, freedom of the press and religion, students and scientists, human rights principles and the race for a coronavirus vaccine.Analysts on both sides say bilateral relations are at their worst since before 1979, when the United States formally recognized the People\u2019s Republic of China.ADAfter the news broke, a phrase that Mao Zedong, who established the communist-run People\u2019s Republic of China, wrote in 1949 about the China-U.S. relationship began trending on the Chinese Internet: \u201cCast Away Illusions, Prepare for Struggle.\u201d\u201cAt this rate, I wouldn\u2019t even be surprised if Trump decides to sever diplomatic relations with China someday,\u201d said Chu Shulong, a professor in American politics and diplomacy at Tsinghua University, suggesting that this was part of President Trump\u2019s reelection strategy.ADJessica Chen Weiss, a Cornell University expert on China\u2019s foreign relations, said the move appeared calculated to drum up fears of China as an existential threat, rather than as an indictment of specific actions.\u201cClosing the consulate does not appear to be part of a coherent strategy to deter or compel China to alter its behavior,\u201d Weiss said. \u201cIt looks more like a \u2018shock and awe\u2019 strategy to distract U.S. voters from the Trump administration\u2019s disastrous response to the pandemic.\u201dADThe Trump administration ordered the consulate\u2019s closure \u201cto protect American intellectual property and Americans\u2019 private information,\u201d State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus said Wednesday.AD\u201cThe United States will not tolerate the PRC\u2019s violations of our sovereignty and intimidation of our people, just as we have not tolerated the PRC\u2019s unfair trade practices, theft of American jobs and other egregious behavior,\u201d she said, using the abbreviation for China\u2019s official name.In a separate statement, the State Department accused China of having engaged \u201cin massive illegal spying and influence operations,\u201d interfering in \u201cdomestic politics,\u201d coercing \u201cour business leaders\u201d and threatening \u201cfamilies of Chinese Americans residing in China, and more.\u201dThe Chinese Embassy in Washington condemned what it called \u201can outrageous and unjustified move which sabotages China-U.S. relations.\u201d The embassy said it has followed the rules laid out in the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations and accused the United States of unlawfully opening diplomatic pouches and searching the contents.ADAD\u201cBecause of the willful and reckless stigmatization and fanning up of hatred by the U.S. side, the Chinese Embassy in the U.S. has received threats to the safety and security of Chinese diplomatic missions and personnel more than once,\u201d it said in a statement.U.S. accuses China of sponsoring attempt to hack vaccine researchThe Chinese government is suspected of using the Houston consulate as a hub for aggressive intelligence operations that U.S. officials said had gone too far, and its closure can be read as a rebuke and a warning to Beijing, said a U.S. official, who like others spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive information.Another U.S. official said that the People\u2019s Liberation Army has been sending Chinese students to American universities, and that the Houston consulate is the epicenter of all the malign activities facilitated by China.ADADThe closure came one day after the Justice Department unsealed indictments against two Chinese hackers, accusing them of stealing intellectual property from U.S. firms researching the novel coronavirus and other sensitive information.The FBI is investigating clandestine Chinese activity in American research institutions, a law enforcement official said. Officers with the People\u2019s Liberation Army have come to the United States masquerading as doctors and medical researchers and embedding with universities, research facilities and pharmaceutical companies, the official said.On Monday, for example, federal authorities arrested a Chinese woman who had claimed to be a neurologist coming to California to conduct brain disease research at Stanford University. In reality, she is affiliated with the Chinese Air Force, according to the Justice Department.ADADLast month, U.S. authorities arrested a Chinese scientific researcher as he tried to fly out of Los Angeles. According to court documents, he said the head of his military university lab had ordered him to observe a lab at the University of California in San Francisco, and relay information so it could be replicated in China.The United States expects foreign governments to conduct intelligence activities within its borders, but espionage usually follows a set of unspoken rules.Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), the acting chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, called the consulate a \u201ccentral node of the Communist Party\u2019s vast network of spies\u201d and said that closing it \u201cneeded to happen.\u201dADAt a news conference in Copenhagen, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said European intellectual property had also been stolen, \u201ccosting hundreds of thousands of jobs \u2014  good jobs for hard-working people all across Europe and America stolen by the Chinese Communist Party.\u201dAD\u201cWe are setting out clear expectations for how the Chinese Communist Party is going to behave, and when they don\u2019t, we\u2019re going to take actions that protect the American people, protect our security, our national security, and also protect our economy and jobs,\u201d he added.The first sign of the American order came when Houston NBC affiliate KPRC2 aired video showing people in the courtyard of the consulate apparently burning documents after 8 p.m. local time Tuesday. The consulate\u2019s staff had been told it would be evicted from the building at 4 p.m. Friday, the Houston Chronicle reported.In Beijing, the Foreign Ministry responded angrily to the order. The U.S. government \u201cabruptly informed\u201d China on Tuesday that it had to immediately close its consulate in Houston, Wang Wenbin, a Foreign Ministry spokesman, told reporters Wednesday.AD\u201cThe U.S. has far more diplomatic missions and staff working in China. So if the U.S. is bent on going down this wrong path, we will resolutely respond,\u201d he said.In addition to its embassy in Beijing, the United States has consulates in Shenyang, Shanghai, Wuhan, Chengdu and Guangzhou.  Analysts expect the Chinese government to respond by ordering one of them closed. The Wuhan consulate, evacuated in January as the coronavirus began spreading in the city,  has not reopened, and the embassy and other consulates are operating with skeleton staffs, according to American officials.Wang said the order came amid American attacks on China\u2019s political system, harassment of Chinese diplomats and intimidation of Chinese students. He said the consulate had been getting prank phone calls and even received a bomb threat on Monday.The United States and China have battled for supremacy since the start of the Trump administration, centered on trade and technology. Both sides have expelled journalists this year and slapped sanctions on each other\u2019s officials.But the hostilities have become much more serious with Trump\u2019s efforts to blame the Chinese government for the coronavirus that emerged in Wuhan at the end of last year and retaliatory actions over journalists in the countries.The Foreign Ministry on Wednesday renewed its travel warning for Chinese students in the United States, advising them to be aware of arbitrary interrogations, the confiscation of personal belongings and possible detentions.Chu, the Tsinghua professor, agreed that there was potential for further tension.\u201cChina could always evict a U.S. consulate in retaliation, and that could go on and on,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nMorello, Nakashima and Harris reported from Washington.

Subscribe today.arrow-rightThe police force tweeted Wednesday that it had detained four people for allegedly advocating for Hong Kong\u2019s independence. All four \u201cclaimed to be students,\u201d the tweet said. Under the new law, the crime of secession carries a maximum sentence of life in prison. All four were denied bail.Li Kwai-Wah, a senior superintendent at the newly established national security department, said the four people arrested had said that \u201cthey want to establish a Hong Kong republic and that they will unreservedly fight for it.\u201d ADAD\u201cThey also said they want to unite all pro-independence groups in Hong Kong for this purpose,\u201d he added. They were arrested at locations across the city, unlike previous arrests under the national security law, which happened at a street protest on July 1.Police allege the young people made such comments on social media. Tech companies such as Facebook, Google and Twitter have already suspended processing data requests from Hong Kong authorities, worried about the implications of the new national security law and its potential to violate human rights.What is happening in Hong Kong?Police did not identify them, but Studentlocalism, a now-disbanded pro-independence group, said four of its former members were arrested. They include Tony Chung, a former convener of the group.ADStudentlocalism was disbanded on June 30, a day before the new law came into force.ADUnder the new measures, those convicted of crimes amounting to what Beijing described as \u201cseparatism,\u201d \u201csubversion,\u201d \u201cterrorism\u201d and \u201ccollusion with foreign forces\u201d could face life sentences. The law also allows for police to enter homes without a warrant, conduct surveillance on those suspected to have violated the law and seize their devices.Li, the senior superintendent, said DNA samples of those arrested may be taken.Opponents see the new law as a dangerous infringement on Hong Kong\u2019s relative autonomy from China. The city has operated under semiautonomous rule since 1997, when Britain handed the former colony back to China under the agreement that Beijing would preserve the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d framework until 2047.Ho-fung Hung, a professor of political economy at Johns Hopkins University, said that Hong Kong residents have feared a crackdown on free speech since the law was implemented. The arrests Wednesday are likely to amplify those concerns.ADAD\u201cIt seems [officials] are testing the waters and the world\u2019s reaction to it by picking some lesser-known people,\u201d he said, noting that some of Hong Kong\u2019s most prominent activists were not among those detained on Wednesday.

A mid-June survey conducted by the Hong Kong Public Opinion Research Institute (PORI) shows a majority of Hong Kongers firmly oppose the law, even before the full impact of the measure was clear.Support our journalism. Subscribe today.arrow-rightCritics call the NSL \u201cthe end of Hong Kong\u201d because it operates above the Basic Law (Hong Kong\u2019s mini-constitution), making it easier for Chinese and Hong Kong authorities to target political activities challenging Beijing\u2019s authority.What will this mean for Hong Kong\u2019s pro-democracy movement? Here\u2019s what you need to know.The NSL puts protesters at riskThe annual July 1 protest of the 1997 handover of Hong Kong, normally attended by a large crowd, had only a few thousand marchers this year. Police arrested 350 people, charging 10 with newly designated offenses such as displaying the Hong Kong independent flag. The new law also bans and criminalizes the protest movement\u2019s \u201cLiberate Hong Kong, Revolution of Our Time\u201d slogan, along with the \u201cGlory to Hong Kong\u201d anthem. Some protesters replaced vibrant protest art with blank placards to protest the \u201cwhite terror\u201d that has descended in the city.China\u2019s new national security law for Hong Kong will erode Hong Kong\u2019s autonomyThe new law also strengthens Beijing\u2019s hard and soft repression on communities vital to the sustainability of the movement. Local political groups such as Demosist\u014d (led by Joshua Wong) disbanded on June 30, on the eve of the law\u2019s promulgation. Fearful of repercussions from the Hong Kong government, many pro-democracy businesses that formed the \u201cyellow economy circle\u201d removed all protest-themed decorations from their storefronts and halted the sale of protest-related products.ADADLarge-scale mobilization in Hong Kong may become more difficult. Instead, protesters might begin to shift their focus toward the \u201c3Ds\u201d \u2014 decentralize, diversify and daily \u2014 as ways to continue their resistance against Beijing\u2019s crackdown. Decentralized and diversified tactics like nonobedience, volunteering in communities and withdrawing money from mainland banks, for instance, may leave people less vulnerable to police repression.Extraterritoriality sends shock wave beyond Hong KongChapter 3 of the law vaguely defines activities of collusion with foreign forces, which include \u201cincitement,\u201d \u201cassistance,\u201d \u201cabetment\u201d and \u201cprovision\u201d of financial supports to undermine Beijing. Article 38 also asserts extraterritorial jurisdiction, meaning the law can apply to anyone \u2014 even foreign nationals \u2014 for an offense committed anywhere.ADADMany Hong Kong activists suspect the law aims to undermine international pressure on Beijing, including from the U.S. Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act and Hong Kong Autonomy Act, which threaten economic sanctions on businesses and individuals that help restrict Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy.Capital flight, particularly from finance and banking entities in Hong Kong, probably will intensify as companies worry about the negative financial repercussions if they do not toe Beijing\u2019s line. Beijing has twisted the arms of international companies, including U.K.-based banks HSBC and Standard Chartered, to sign a petition backing the law.The law may also have dire implications for academic freedom and international collaboration. Hosting workshops and conferences in Hong Kong could put both foreign and local scholars and organizers at risk. Many Hong Kong scholars are already wary about making comments or publishing research that could upset the Chinese government.ADADTech companies, including Facebook, Google and WhatsApp, have said they will temporarily stop complying with requests for user data from the Hong Kong authorities, as this information could be used to surveil the populace and incriminate dissidents.Coronavirus emptied Hong Kong\u2019s streets, but the pro-democracy protests continuedSeveral countries have issued warnings against traveling to Hong Kong, citing risks of arbitrary detention on national security grounds. The U.K., U.S., Taiwan and Australian governments are easing immigration criteria allowing Hong Kongers to seek asylum and foreign citizenship. Some are considering terminating extradition agreements with Hong Kong to protect their own citizens.Where does this leave Hong Kong\u2019s legislative election?Hoping to repeat their landslide victory in last November\u2019s District Council elections, the pro-democracy camp launched the \u201c35+\u201d campaign to capture more than half of the Legislative Council or LegCo\u2019s 70 seats, with 35 seats directly elected by all eligible voters in geographical constituencies and 35 seats allocated by functional constituencies, which comprise only members of various business sectors. Occupy Central organizer Benny Tai and former legislator Au Nok-hin coordinated the pro-democracy primary on July 11 and 12 to select favored candidates in each district to be officially nominated for September\u2019s LegCo election.ADADThe city\u2019s pro-democracy opposition has never won a majority in LegCo elections. The electoral system \u2014 proportional representation with Hare quota \u2014 does not favor large parties, creating a fragmented partisan landscape where pro-democracy parties find themselves in bitter divisions competing in the geographic constituency voting. Meanwhile, the functional constituency serves to sustain the state-business alliance, giving political privileges to business sectors.Aside from this uneven playing field, the \u201c35+\u201d plan is facing extra political hurdles. Article 35 stipulates any resident convicted of security national offenses will be banned from running in local elections, while lawmakers and government officials will be immediately evicted from their posts if found guilty. Erick Tsang, the head of the Constitutional and Mainland Affairs Bureau, warned recently that organizing and participating in the primary may violate the law. PORI, a co-organizer of the primary, reports police raided its offices just a day before the primary.Despite the threats of the new law, more than 600,000 people voted in the primary, far exceeding the organizers\u2019 estimates. Many candidates with strong recognition in the movement have found themselves leading the poll in all five districts, signaling a changing of the guard within the pro-democracy camp.ADADIt is uncertain whether and when any (if not all) pro-democracy candidates face disqualification, but candidates will no doubt expect tight scrutiny of their speeches and stances on the national security law and other government policies.If the pro-democracy candidates fail to win a LegCo majority this fall, they will lose their veto power over major legislation.

As a Hoover Institution report released Thursday documents, researchers from Chinese institutions with the central mission of modernizing China\u2019s military have co-authored hundreds of scientific articles with American colleagues.Support our journalism. Subscribe today.arrow-rightAmong those partnering with American researchers are Chinese scientists involved in stealth technology and classified weapons studies, those employed by the PLA\u2019s General Arms Department and those engaged in work on high-tech naval systems. The report does not say whether any of the studies done with American partners were directly related to weapons development. Regardless, the report questions why so many academies that serve the advancement of China\u2019s military are intent on sending researchers to the United States.\u201cThese cases establish that U.S. scholars and research institutions have been contributing directly to the [People\u2019s Republic of China\u2019s] military modernization,\u201d the report concludes.ADADAuthored by historian Glenn Tiffert, U.S. government researcher Jeffrey Stoff and Kevin Gamache, an administrator who has led efforts to heighten security awareness at U.S. universities, the report is an example of how organizations controlled by the Chinese Communist Party have leveraged the openness of U.S. society to bolster China\u2019s military power.For decades, the U.S. government and U.S. society were generally sympathetic to China\u2019s rise based on the belief that, as China strengthened, it would embrace Western values. But that mood has shifted, given the wholesale rejection of a more pluralistic society by the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. The party continues to threaten democratic Taiwan with invasion and is engaged in a widespread crackdown on dissent, not just on mainland China, including in Xinjiang, but also in the Chinese territory of Hong Kong.The Hoover report, \u201cGlobal Engagement: Rethinking Risk in the Research Enterprise,\u201d identified 254 articles published in scientific and engineering publications between Jan. 1, 2013, and March 31, 2019. The articles were found by searching a Chinese database for scholarly articles called the China National Knowledge Infrastructure platform.ADADThe 254 articles were co-authored by U.S.-based researchers and counterparts from institutions that are known in China as the \u201cSeven Sons of National Defense\u201d: the Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, the Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin Engineering University, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics and Nanjing University of Science and Technology. The core mission of these institutions, the report says, \u201cis to support the PRC\u2019s defense research and industrial base and promote or execute military-civil fusion policies, which channel civilian research into military applications.\u201d Four of the seven institutions are on the U.S. Department of Commerce\u2019s Entity List for export control purposes, but U.S. universities still allow their scientists to collaborate with researchers from those Chinese institutions.The report does not say that American researchers broke U.S. laws when they participated in projects with their Chinese colleagues. It argues, however, that \u201cit is not in the U.S. national interest to collaborate and assist with the military development efforts of the PRC, a nation that the U.S. government increasingly views as a strategic competitor and military rival.\u201d So, \u201ceven if the relevant research is unclassified, considered basic or fundamental, and is ultimately published in open sources,\u201d the report asks, should U.S. institutions really be making these people better at what they do? Its answer is no.The report calls on U.S. universities and research institutions to acknowledge that there are \u201csystemic flaws\u201d in the way they have approached the challenges of foreign engagement. To remedy those flaws, it says, U.S. institutions need a new paradigm for risk management, one that understands that many threats to national security and economic competitiveness fall below the threshold of explicit illegality.ADADUnderlying the report is a belief that many U.S. universities and research institutions are talking out of both sides of their mouths when it comes to their engagement with China. On one hand, the institutions argue that U.S. society should be about independence and autonomy and that federal government should leave them alone to partner with whomever they see fit, especially in basic research. At the same time, such institutions contend that they are not equipped to make determinations about individual scholars. But U.S. institutions can\u2019t have it both ways. And in particular, the report says, they need to work harder to ensure that they are not actively involved in helping the People\u2019s Liberation Army.The report does not particularly criticize China for leveraging the openness of the U.S. system. The United States\u2019 pantry is wide open. If it\u2019s so easy to hide one\u2019s military background from incredulous American administrators, how can we blame researchers from China for walking in and helping themselves?Read more:ADADJohn Pomfret: To cool off U.S.-China tensions, let\u2019s start with a truce on media accessJosh Rogin: Trump\u2019s China hawks are loose and not wasting any timeCharles Dunst: Welcome to China\u2019s new interventionist foreign policyJosh Rogin: The coronavirus crisis shows the risks of scientific collaboration with ChinaDeborah Seligsohn: The U.S.-China collaboration on health collapsed under Trump.

That\u2019s similar to how Chinese mobile phone makers and other producers of technically sophisticated hardware have taken on their foreign rivals.ADThe official Xinhua News Agency said BeiDou is compatible with the three other systems but gave no details on how they would work together.For China, among the chief advantages of the system, whose construction began 30 years ago, is the ability to replace GPS for guiding its missiles, especially important now amid rising tensions with Washington.ADIt also stands to raise China\u2019s economic and political leverage over nations adopting the system, ensuring that they line up behind China\u2019s position on Taiwan, Tibet the South China Sea and other sensitive matters or risk losing their access.Key to China\u2019s success was the China Academy of Space Technology\u2019s development of rubidium atomic clocks that provide time and frequency standards for BDS satellites, Xinhua said.It said the system was proof that attempts by Washington to impose a \u201ctough hi-tech blockage\u201d and crackdown on Chinese companies such as Huawei had failed.AD\u201cIn spite of such measures, China\u2019s innovation capability has only grown stronger.

The president later said he had not been tested more than once on a given day.ADFollowing a tour of the facility, Trump likened the push for a vaccine to a wartime effort, predicted a quick economic rebound from the pandemic and repeated misleading statistics about the number of tests conducted in the United States.

Lufax, backed by Ping An Insurance Group Co., is going one step further, braving the U.S. Senate\u2019s new Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act and\u00a0targeting to  raise at least $3 billion in New York.Support our journalism. Subscribe today.arrow-rightBillion-dollar initial public offerings\u00a0are encouraging news for market sentiment. But we can\u2019t help but wonder: Is this really a good time to celebrate their success, when tension between the U.S. and China is escalating into a war for capital?At first glance, the timing couldn\u2019t be better. China\u2019s regulatory environment has become friendlier\u00a0as Beijing, pinched by the coronavirus, loosens its purse strings. Meanwhile, stock markets are rewarding tech companies that consumers use every day.\u00a0California-based PayPal Holdings Inc., for instance, has soared about 60% this year. In China,\u00a0Ant Group\u2019s ubiquitous mobile payment product, AliPay, fits the bill. Paper money is dirty in the Covid-19 era and no one wants to handle cash.ADADBut by listing this year, Ant and Lufax run the risk of exposing how volatile and unsteady China\u2019s financial regulations can be, potentially adding fuel to speculation that the nation\u2019s  Lehman moment is drawing nearer.\u00a0Beijing first vowed to clamp down on private-sector debt in late 2017, with the People\u2019s Bank of China\u00a0pointing fingers at rising risks in asset management and internet finance. It\u00a0followed with far-reaching rules for the\u00a0financial industry in April 2018.Since then, regulators have blown hot and cold\u00a0on practices in the online lending\u00a0industry, leading to significant uncertainty for loaning out money and the availability of consumer credit. Going public in 2020 means that Ant and Lufax will have to explain what happened to their business models in 2018 and 2019.Both behemoths took a hit. For most of 2017, consumer micro lending was a lucrative business for Ant, accounting for almost 20% of the group\u2019s income, Bernstein Research estimated.\u00a0But that cash cow\u2019s milk\u00a0turned sour\u00a0that December,\u00a0when Beijing suspended all unsecured online cash loans. Ant could no longer offer\u00a0asset-backed securities exceeding 2.3 times its total capital. Issuing such bonds had been\u00a0a capital-efficient way for Ant to pass its loan books on to funds.ADADThe change\u00a0was painful. In the fourth quarter of 2017,\u00a0Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., which\u00a0has a\u00a0one-third\u00a0equity stake,\u00a0received a payment of 193 million yuan ($27.6 million)\u00a0from Ant, down from 2 billion yuan in the three months ending in September.\u00a0Lufax, China\u2019s largest peer-to-peer lender, also saw seismic changes. Until late 2017, the country\u2019s\u00a0online financing business was driven by P2P, with total outstanding loans\u00a0peaking at\u00a01.1 trillion yuan. Regulatory tightening practically killed this model. Nowadays, facilitation \u2014\u00a0essentially matchmaking \u2014\u00a0is the norm, with banks accounting for about 45% of online consumption loans, according to CLSA Ltd. estimates. Last July, Lufax substantially scaled back its core P2P\u00a0business.These IPOs\u00a0will expose the true state of millions of consumer\u00a0balance sheets. Thanks in part to the rise of\u00a0companies like Ant and Lufax, Chinese\u00a0are no longer debt-free.\u00a0At the end of last year, household debt totaled more than\u00a060 trillion yuan, or 62% of gross domestic product. Their ability to repay\u00a0is worsening. Data from the central bank show\u00a0that while consumption loans drawn from financial institutions rose\u00a0over\u00a013% in June from a year earlier,\u00a0disposable incomes are shrinking, unemployment is rising, and the cash flows of borrowers\u00a0are looking smaller.Investors may find that\u00a0the picture\u00a0wasn\u2019t all rosy, even before Covid-19. For instance, Qudian Inc., a smaller\u00a0lender,\u00a0noted that its D1 delinquency rate, a real-time representation of its portfolio asset quality, rose to 13% at the end of last year\u00a0from 10% in the previous three months.\u00a0Sure, financial distress at Qudian\u2019s customers might appear\u00a0minor in the bigger picture,\u00a0but it could seem much\u00a0less idiosyncratic when\u00a0public offerings reveal such\u00a0details from Ant and Lufax. They\u00a0respectively account for 32% and 13% of online lending, according to CLSA. It\u2019s not clear why Beijing would want to let these two cats out of the bag.\u00a0ADADThe coronavirus\u00a0will muddy\u00a0the waters further, especially for those seeking to borrow online. Asset-backed securities\u00a0sponsored by banks did better than those by\u00a0finance companies, potentially reflecting\u00a0the less-prime nature of the latter\u2019s customers. A significant increase in delinquencies\u00a0may leave online\u00a0lenders short of capital. There will be lasting pain.Six-year-old Ant was once known as the\u00a0firm that threatened the stranglehold\u00a0of China\u2019s giant banks. One of its main offerings has been the systemically important\u00a0money-market fund, Yu\u2019e Bao, which has\u00a0more than 600 million Chinese investors.\u00a0Lufax\u00a0had\u00a044\u00a0million customers on its platform at the end of 2019, with 347 billion yuan of their\u00a0assets under management. Its\u00a0loan book stood at 462 billion yuan, up 23.3% from a year earlier.\u00a0If the two firms\u00a0had\u00a0waited a few more years, they wouldn\u2019t have to explain the awkward period\u00a0of 2018 and 2019.\u00a0By\u00a0allowing\u00a0early investors and company insiders to cash out\u00a0now, Ant and Lufax will lay bare the\u00a0ugly side of China\u2019s financial industry. Foreigners will be sifting through the prospectus of each offering, wondering what China\u2019s subprime consumers look like in the Covid-19 era \u2013 and for years to come.ADADThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Shuli Ren is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering Asian markets.

Subscribe today.arrow-rightAll this has many observers \u2014 even in the White House \u2014 speaking of a new \u201cCold War\u201d between the United States and China. Some even argue that this is desirable, presumably with the belief that our side will naturally emerge victorious.ADADYet the phrase is a misleading one. It assumes that the terms of the old Cold War between the Soviet Union and the United States, which we fought and won, are relevant, and that the tools used successfully then could be used again now.This conceptual error ignores the many differences between then and now. It is worth recalling that the Soviet Union was not our major trading partner, was not a major holder of our debt and was not tightly interconnected in the supply chains critical to our (and the world\u2019s) economy.The Cold War was fought and won pretty much exclusively on military and cultural terms. The economic side was relevant only because the Soviets' doomed model inhibited any real competition. We were neither competitors nor partners in the economic space. A new Cold War between the United States and China would be something else entirely. It is difficult to see how it could be fought effectively, not to mention successfully.ADADThis is by no means to question the need to respond to increasingly aggressive behavior by China. But the U.S. response must be coherent, disciplined and sophisticated. It must balance capabilities and objectives. Reverting to a Cold War mentality will drive us toward belligerent posturing that has little or no chance of changing Chinese behavior and could, on the contrary, provoke overreactions and dangerous miscalculations on both sides.Above all, we must create a deliberate strategy that is aimed at managing this great-power conflict rather than vanquishing a foe. This is very hard work, requiring patience, conviction and broad political support. It also requires the full participation of our allies, both in the region and elsewhere. We must undertake these efforts with the imperative of preventing a downward spiral toward armed conflict.Too often, U.S. policy toward China seems to be motivated by the urge to score points for short-term political benefit. Yet the Chinese are clearly pursuing their foreign policy goals according to a carefully calculated long-term strategy.ADADThat Chinese long game was defined first by Xi Jinping\u2019s successful internal campaign to secure the regime\u2019s survival, which has now positioned him at the head of an explicitly totalitarian state. Beijing\u2019s long-term strategy also includes an extremely ambitious foreign policy agenda, aimed first at shifting the center of the world economy to Eurasia through the Belt and Road Initiative.At the same time, China is pursuing increasingly aggressive territorial ambitions, including the clear intention to absorb Taiwan into the People\u2019s Republic. Our decades-long coherent management of this issue is increasingly challenged.China\u2019s strategy also aims to encircle the West technologically, dominating all the advanced systems of data collection and manipulation, including artificial intelligence, robotics, aerospace and quantum computing, always taking into account potential military applications. China has recognized, far earlier and far more clearly than any of the rest of us, that technology is the determining factor in the decisive battle of this moment in history. Beijing is working hard to create an overwhelming Chinese advantage in this battle. We must win this conflict with coherent strategies and, crucially, by cultivating the support of allies.ADADIn response to these and other challenges, the rest of the world, hopefully led once again by the United States, must respond with unity and long-range vision. Nearly spontaneous and seemingly unconnected irritations such as closing a consulate, imposing sanctions on a few officials, tweaking tariffs or sanctioning individual companies merely provoke countermeasures that will inhibit real management of this immense and complicated problem.Most importantly, policies by the United States and our allies must be aimed at expanding the diplomatic and political space to work these issues creatively and productively. This will take time. And it will also require the rebuilding of alliance cohesion and multilateral institutions capable of responding to China\u2019s long-term strategic vision with policies of comparable coherence and strength. As we know from the past, only the United States can forge those tools. Our allies and other like-minded nations are beginning to recognize the threats China poses to our common future. They will become increasingly receptive to enlightened leadership from the United States.Read more:ADADHugh Hewitt: Pompeo\u2019s speech opens a bold new chapter in U.S.-China relationsRichard Haass: What Mike Pompeo doesn\u2019t understand about China, Richard Nixon and U.S. foreign policyMax Boot: No one does more to hurt America and help China than TrumpThe Post\u2019s View: China has just broken its solemn promise to Hong KongEzra F.

Subscribe today.arrow-right\u200bBut perhaps the most worrisome element in the law is what is left unsaid. And that is that the legislation could serve as a blueprint for dealing with Taiwan. In fact, with the passage of the national security law on Hong Kong, China has arguably moved a step closer to preparing for war with the island democracy that sits 90 miles off its coast.Don\u2019t take my word for it. Listen to Li Su, the president of the Modern Think-Tank Forum and a prominent hard-liner in Beijing. Following the passage of the law, Li took to Chinese social media to hail the law as a critical step in \u201cliberating Taiwan.\u201d Li is part of an influential group of scholars in China who support an armed solution to what they call \u201cthe Taiwan problem.\u201dADADLi has given speeches in Taiwan warning people on the island of China\u2019s will to invade it. In April 2019, Taiwan\u2019s government barred him from returning to Taipei to give another speech because he had advocated the use of force. Li also led a delegation of Chinese academics to the United States in 2019 to hammer home China\u2019s intentions to take over the island. When I met with him then, I was taken aback by the clarity of his message: \u201cWe are going to fight a war to reunite with Taiwan,\u201d he told me. He also chillingly predicted how China would launch its current crackdown in Hong Kong.\u200bIn his lecture on Chinese social media, Li said he interpreted the Hong Kong security law as a \u201ctest case\u201d on which China will model its takeover of Taiwan. \u201cWe will learn how to control Taiwan by experimenting with this law on Hong Kong,\u201d he declared. \u201cFrom the experiment on Hong Kong, we will tell the people on Taiwan that after we forcibly unite with you, we will have a way to deal with you.\u201d Simply put, that would consist of rounding up \u201cyour independence activists, democracy activists, students who cause trouble and bring them to the mainland to be sentenced.\u201d After that, Li asked, \u201cwho would dare oppose us?\u201d At least 10 people have already been arrested in Hong Kong under the new law, and Chinese officials said they could be tried in mainland Chinese courts.\u200bFor years, China has used Hong Kong as a test case for its dealings with Taiwan. In 1997, China agreed with Britain to resume control over Britain\u2019s old colony of Hong Kong under a model that the Chinese government called \u201cone country, two systems.\u201d Under that model, China promised to maintain Hong Kong\u2019s freewheeling capitalist and more open political system for 50 years, an agreement that China is now accused of breaking. China subsequently proposed to Taiwan that it follow the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d model to unite with China. Today, a vast majority of Taiwanese, who live in one of Asia\u2019s most vibrant democracies, reject any idea of uniting with mainland China.ADAD\u200bChina claims Taiwan is part of China and has never abandoned the threat of force to take over the island. China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, reiterated that vow in a speech on Jan. 1, 2019, declaring that China would \u201cretain the option of taking all necessary measures\u201d to absorb the island. U.S. law requires that the U.S. government provide for Taiwan\u2019s defense but stops short of requiring that American soldiers die for Taiwan.There has been considerable speculation in China that Xi wants to solve \u201cthe Taiwan question\u201d sometime near July of next year, when the Chinese Communist Party will celebrate its centenary. Li said the promulgation of the security law last week basically confirmed that theory. \u201cSometime around 2021,\u201d Li predicted, \u201cwe are definitely going to liberate Taiwan.\u201d\u200bLi and other like-minded hard-liners played down the reaction of Western nations, which were generally united in their condemnation of the Hong Kong law. \u201cChina\u2019s enemies are a group of a dragons without a head,\u201d Li declared. \u201cThe U.S. is already a hooligan nation. How can a hooligan nation be a leader? America doesn\u2019t even qualify to be China\u2019s opponent. \u2026 What are they going to do, fight a war over Hong Kong?\u201dADADThe same question could be asked for Taiwan.Read more:The Post\u2019s View: China has just broken its solemn promise to Hong KongAnn Telnaes: The promise and reality of Hong Kong freedom, in cartoonsArthur Tam: Hong Kong and Taiwan are cultural powerhouses.

Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) is confident Congress will deliver another surge of funding to help states run safe and secure elections in November despite opposition from many Republicans and a barrage of attacks on mail voting by President Trump.Support our journalism. Subscribe today.arrow-rightThe main driver, she says, will be state and local election officials of both parties convincing lawmakers and the public the money is necessary to manage massive increases in voting by mail and to buy protective equipment and other resources to ensure in-person voting doesn\u2019t become a hotbed for spreading the coronavirus. \u00a0\u201cNo matter what party anyone belongs to, they understand we\u2019re going to have a cataclysmic change in how people are going to vote this fall,\u201d Klobuchar told me. \u201cThere are states that are changing from 3 percent to up to 60 percent vote by mail\u2026People have figured that out.\u201dADADThe last chance for any significant election funding boost before November\u2019s contest is approaching quickly: a massive coronavirus relief measure that lawmakers are struggling to pass before millions of Americans are hit with a drop in unemployment benefits.\u00a0Republicans didn\u2019t include any money for elections in their $1 trillion first draft of that bill. But Democrats are pushing hard to add funding in a compromise measure. And Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.), chairman of the Senate Rules Committee, which oversees election issues, has acknowledged states may need more help for elections. Klobuchar is the top Democrat on that committee and has been working with Blunt on funding plans. \u00a0If the money doesn\u2019t come through, Klobuchar said, she fears the sort of Election Day breakdowns that took place during primaries in Wisconsin, Georgia and the District of Columbia, where voters didn't receive mail ballots they requested, were stuck in long in-person voting lines and even risked contracting the coronavirus.\u00a0ADADIn Wisconsin, 71 people who voted in person on primary day or worked at polling places later tested positive for the virus, the state\u2019s health department said.\u00a0\u201cMy concern is that we\u2019re going to have Wisconsin on steroids,\u201d Klobuchar told me. \u201cYou\u2019ll have so many more people voting than you did in the primaries\u2026[and] you\u2019re going to have people that get sick from voting.\u201d\u00a0Klobuchar has led Senate Democrats in pushing for another $3.6 billion to protect elections during the pandemic.\u00a0She declined to say how much election money she believes will emerge from negotiations but it\u2019s unlikely to be nearly that high.\u00a0Republicans have repeatedly balked at Democratic efforts to increase federal spending to protect elections against digital threats from Russia and China and more recently to ensure safe voting during the pandemic. And during two other rounds of negotiations over cybersecurity money in the past two years, Republicans have always agreed to more funding at the last minute. In total they've delivered about $1.2 billion for election security and safety, including $400 million in the first coronavirus relief bill in March.\u00a0ADADIt's also unlikely the latest measure will include mandates that are in a Senate bill Klobuchar sponsored and a House-passed coronavirus relief bill that states must offer mail voting to all residents in future elections and provide early voting days.\u00a0Whatever money does reach states can be extremely useful before November, she said.Mail voting is expected to rise significantly across the country, especially in about half of states that allow all residents to vote by mail without an excuse and about a dozen more that are allowing no-excuse mail voting during the pandemic.\u00a0Time\u2019s running short for some of those states to buy some specialty equipment such as high-speed scanners and drop-off boxes for mail votes, according to a timeline prepared by the Election Reform Program at New York University's\u00a0Brennan Center\u00a0for\u00a0Justice.ADADBut there\u2019s still plenty of time for election officials to buy vital materials that are in much broader supply, she said. And the money could help reimburse states that have drained their limited funds preparing for the pandemic and are now short in other areas.\u00a0\u201cThere are a lot of things that are pretty fundamental,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can buy stamps in three months. You can buy envelopes. You can buy training for poll workers. You can buy [personal protective equipment] for poll workers.\u201d\u00a0Klobuchar also thinks Trump\u2019s persistent attacks on voting by mail are likely to backfire.\u00a0The president has claimed without evidence that voting by mail will lead to widespread fraud, despite having voted by mail himself this year.\u00a0ADBut that message is unlikely to resonate with the presidents\u2019 opponents who are likely to take advantage of mail voting in record numbers, Klobuchar said.\u00a0AD\u201cThey won\u2019t have an effect on Democrats and independent voters,\u201d she said. \u201cI suppose he might scare some of his own base from wanting to vote by mail. I don\u2019t understand what he\u2019s doing. Nor do [many] Republicans.\u201dIn fact, a\u00a0Washington Post analysis\u00a0found possible voter fraud cases in states that vote primarily by mail accounted for just 0.0025 percent of ballots in 2016 and 2018 \u00a0\u2014 or about one out of every 39,000.\u00a0And primary turnout suggests Trump\u2019s attacks on mail voting may already be dissuading Republicans from using the system.\u00a0ADTrump expanded his attacks yesterday, seemingly pointing to a New York primary contest that has been riddled with problems and delays to argue mail voting will cause confusion and chaos. \u00a0Voters returned about 403,000 mail ballots in that race compared with 23,000 in the 2016 primary and officials have struggled to process them.\u00a0Klobuchar, meanwhile, pointed to the same primary as evidence that states need more money to properly handle mail in ballots. New York has historically had a very low percentage of people voting by mail and lacks much of the infrastructure that helps mail voting go smoothly in states where it\u2019s more common.\u00a0AD\u201cWe have the facts on our side,\u201d she said.\u00a0The keysA national security review of TikTok will land on Trump\u2019s desk this week.\u00a0The inquiry focuses on whether Byte Dance, \u00a0the Chinese company that owns TikTok, might use it to aid Bejing's spying or to spread Chinese propaganda, Katy Stech Ferek at the Wall Street Journal reports. \u00a0Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) requested the review in October. The president recently threatened to ban TikTok over similar concerns.ADTikTok is trying to allay concerns by opening up its computer code for U.S. regulators and privacy experts to probe for anything improper, Tony Romm reports.All House members can\u00a0view classified intelligence warnings about \"disinformation\" targeting the 2020 election.\u00a0The House Intelligence Committee voted to share the classified information with the entire chamber after first pushing for an FBI briefing for all members, Jeremy Herb, Zachary Cohen and Manu Raju at CNN report. Committee Chairman Adam B.

After multiple delays, the company\u2019s launch was officially announced in December. The resulting firm, China Oil & Gas Pipeline Group Co., will aim to attract private investors to help expand the $70 billion network and diversify energy supply. Such an overhaul would radically reshape China\u2019s energy sector, although it still leaves control in a single pair of hands.Support our journalism. Subscribe today.arrow-right1. What\u2019s the point of a pipeline company?Almost all developed markets separate oil and gas production from transport to promote a level playing field and encourage new entrants into the market. An independent company also would be more likely, in theory, to decide on new routes based on national need rather than what serves an individual producer. More broadly, it\u2019s part of Xi\u2019s strategy to enhance national energy security by encouraging domestic exploration and multiple sources of supply by ensuring open access to pipeline transport.ADAD2. What does that have to do with smog?China has moved millions of homes and businesses from coal to cleaner-burning natural gas as part of Xi\u2019s pledge to protect the environment. But the transition has been hampered at times by a lack of infrastructure. Gas supplies still run short, especially in winter when demand peaks. China National Petroleum Corp., which operates about three-fourths of the gas network, caps supplies, so some cities turn to trucked-in LNG. Sometimes factories are forced to close to keep people from shivering at home.3. What\u2019s wrong with the current set-up?China imports about 70% of its crude and half its natural gas. Xi wants to produce more at home to enhance national energy security. He also wants more private capital to get involved in exploration, since the Big Three producers -- CNPC and its listed subsidiary PetroChina Co.; Sinopec, the listed unit of China Petrochemical Corp.; and China National Offshore Oil Corp. and its Cnooc Ltd. unit -- haven\u2019t moved fast enough to meet growing demand. Currently, pipeline access can be blocked or is prohibitively expensive for smaller private or foreign firms. Liberalizing the so-called mid-stream transportation -- out of the hands of the Big Three -- is seen as necessary to attract outside investors.ADAD4. How big is the network?As of 2015, China had 64,000 kilometers (about 40,000 miles) of pipelines carrying natural gas, 27,000 carrying crude and 21,000 carrying oil products, according to China\u2019s main economic planning agency. By 2025 its goal is to expand that to 163,000 kilometers for gas, 37,000 for crude and 40,000 for oil products. By comparison, the similarly sized U.S. had 1,984,321 kilometers of natural gas pipeline and 240,000 for petroleum products in 2013, according to the CIA World Factbook.5. How is the spinoff happening?In two deals announced July 23, PipeChina acquired pipelines, terminals and storage facilities from PetroChina and Sinopec for $56 billion in cash and equity. According to Morgan Stanley, PetroChina will own 29.9% of the pipeline firm, Sinopec 14% and Cnooc 3%. The State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of the State Council will take a majority 30% stake and will essentially control the company.ADAD6. Who benefits? Who loses?\u2022 PetroChina received about $38 billion in cash and equity, putting a price-to-book ratio of 1.2 on its assets, triggering a special gain that will likely result in an extraordinary dividend for shareholders, according to Bernstein. Over the longer term, though, PetroChina may see a dilution to earnings and free cash flow as it would be losing one of its most important assets, accounting for about 30% of its book value.\u2022 No. 2 Sinopec might see its stock price improve if the deal means it can spin off its retail business, which includes some crude and refined-oil products pipelines. Disposing of those assets would clear some of the uncertainties that can hold up an IPO.AD\u2022 Cnooc could benefit by being able to sell more of its offshore gas to inland customers, who right now are out of reach because they can\u2019t access the pipelines.\u2022 Gas distributors, such as ENN Energy Holdings Ltd. and China Gas Holdings Ltd., are expected to benefit from the opportunity to diversify gas supply sources.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P.", "comment": "6 Comments", "topic": "Energy"}, {"cover": "", "title": "Consulate closures an inflection point in -US relations", "date": "Jul 26, 2020", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/flag-lowered-as-us-departs-chengdu-consulate-in-china/2020/07/26/9c8cac5a-cfaa-11ea-826b-cc394d824e35_story.html", "keyword": "China and Security", "website": "the Washington Post", "author": "", "content": "CHENGDU, China \u2014 In the more than 40 years since China and the U.S. established formal diplomatic relations, accusations have been traded, tensions have risen and fallen and the two sides have come dangerously close to outright confrontation.Support our journalism.

China will make legitimate and necessary reactions,\u201d the statement said.China maintains consulates in San Francisco, Los Angeles, Chicago and New York in addition to its embassy in Washington.ADThe U.S. has four other consulates in China and an embassy in Beijing, keeping the sides in parity in terms of diplomatic missions.On Monday, pro-China protesters were escorted away from the shuttered consulate as workers covered over the building\u2019s exterior signs.\u201cLong live the Chinese people! Long live the Communist Party of China!\u201d one man shouted before a SWAT team escorted him away.ADAnother briefly flashed a shirt reading \u201cSLING OUT USA!\u201d in English before being taken away.Others expressed regret at the closure. An officer removed a bouquet of flowers that a woman had left at the curb across from the entrance to the consulate.Foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin told reporters at a daily briefing Monday that the shutdown was a \u201clegitimate and necessary response to the unreasonable act\u201d of the closure of the Houston consulate and the entry of U.S. authorities into it.AD\u201cWe urge the U.S. to immediately correct its mistakes and create necessary conditions for the relationship between the two countries to return to the normal track,\u201d Wang said.ADThe Chengdu consulate briefly came to prominence when the police chief of the nearby city of Chongqing fled there in 2012, precipitating the downfall of Chongqing\u2019s politically ambitious leader Bo Xilai in China\u2019s biggest political scandal in decades. It also played host to former Vice President Joe Biden during a visit when the current prospective Democratic Party presidential candidate was accompanied by China\u2019s now-leader Xi Jinping.Police closed off a two- to three-block area around the consulate on Monday morning, cutting off virtually any view of the property including the flag. A few vehicles were allowed through after police checks, and others could be seen moving in the distance.ADOfficers kept a close watch, even after re-opening the area in the afternoon, determined to prevent any sign of unrest.ADWorkers covered over the consulate signs on the wall outside shortly after the property was vacated. They included a bronze plaque near the entrance that a worker had tried to pry off the previous night, but without success.Moving activity on Sunday continued well beyond midnight, with flatbed trailers entering the complex and emerging later carrying large shipping containers.The impending closure of the consulate drew a steady stream of onlookers over the weekend as Chengdu, like Houston, found itself in the limelight of international politics.People stopped to take selfies and photos, some waving Chinese flags in a show of patriotism and others just capturing the moment. A man who tried to unfurl a large placard late Sunday that he called an open letter to the Chinese government was quickly escorted away.ADADThe U.S. alleged that the Houston consulate was a nest of Chinese spies who tried to steal data from facilities in Texas, including the Texas A&M medical system and the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston.

Flaherty teaches human rights and Chinese politics at Princeton University and Fordham Law School.Now that it has arrived, Beijing\u2019s much-feared national security law for Hong Kong heralds nothing less than imperialism with Chinese characteristics.Support our journalism. Subscribe today.arrow-rightImperialism need not always follow the classic British model of colonizing distant lands and peoples. No less typical in recent times is rule over groups with distinctive claims closer to home. But as China\u2019s officials used to point out to the British, imperialism goes hand in fist with repression. With the new national security law, Beijing ironically doubles down on a disastrous model pioneered by Britain itself.ADThe key to this approach is the law\u2019s adoption of a separate and draconian judicial system. In certain broad circumstances, an office of the mainland government in Hong Kong can now refer a case to mainland prosecutors and courts. Apparently, Hong Kong\u2019s own common law courts are not up to dealing with security threats. But the real reason is to better intimidate a restive population. A favorite of imperial regimes and permanent emergency states, this tactic aims for easy convictions, jettisons fundamental due process protections and sweeps up legitimate political opposition.ADThe mainland judicial system China has introduced into Hong Kong could hardly be worse. China has only grown more authoritarian under President Xi Jinping. Beijing lacks \u2014 and even condemns \u2014 the most basic forms of constitutional limits, separation of powers, an independent judiciary, and the idea that the rule of law should constrain either the government or the Chinese Communist Party. In the classic phrase, it is a system that prizes rule by law rather than rule of law.The results: the incarceration of more than 1 million Muslim Uighurs in Xinjiang; the crushing of dissent of any sort; incarceration, torture, trials with preordained results; and the brutal intimidation of lawyers who seek to defend those accused of amorphous laws.ADBut the true measure of the mainland\u2019s neo-imperialism lies in the details of the new law. As a start, the national security offenses of secession, subversion and terrorism are vague, overbroad and malleable. An axiom of criminal law in systems that respect rights is that offenses should be precisely drawn. When not, they are open to the discretion and abuse of those bringing the charges \u2014 and have already been used this way in the mainland.ADThe law\u2019s breadth gives lie to the idea that it will be used in only a \u201csmall minority\u201d of illegal activities, as some local Hong Kong officials have argued. The numbers will be purely under the control of Beijing and its local minions. Nor does the \u201cminority\u201d necessarily have to be that \u201csmall\u201d to effectively clamp down on all dissent. Beyond Hong Kong, the new law purports to extend to any person anywhere in the world who violates its provisions.No less troubling is the law\u2019s introduction of a security apparatus designed to be aggressive from top to bottom. Hong Kong will now have a national security committee headed by the Beijing-approved chief executive. That committee will oversee new special security units of the police and prosecutors. A new \u201cOffice for Safeguarding National Security\u201d of the mainland government will also be on hand should Beijing\u2019s imperial concerns not be addressed.ADWhich brings matters back to the last line of defense: an independent judiciary. The people of Hong Kong, accustomed to one of the best judicial systems in the world, now face prosecution and trial in one of the worst. Despite certain reforms, the problems with mainland judges remain legion: They are generally considered agents of the state and subservient to the party. This is a far cry from Hong Kong\u2019s common law-educated judges, nominated by an independent commission \u2014 and augmented, at least in Hong Kong\u2019s highest court, by a respected foreign common law jurist.ADThe list of dire effects of such a two-track system can go on, as could the list of international and domestic law violations that result. The new law violates Hong Kong\u2019s \u201cmini-constitution,\u201d the Basic Law, which guarantees an independent judiciary and the projection of fundamental rights. China is also obligated to uphold these principles under the Sino-British Joint Declaration, the treaty that handed Hong Kong back to China, and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which it has signed, and which applies in full to Hong Kong.Beijing\u2019s enhanced version of imperial security all but obliterates the high degree of autonomy for Hong Kong it pledged for 50 years. Yet there may be some solace: With sustained pressure from within and without, even the most repressive colonial systems can eventually fall victim to their own lawlessness.ADRead more:The Post\u2019s View: China\u2019s Hong Kong policy: One country, one brutal systemArthur Tam: Hong Kong and Taiwan are cultural powerhouses.

They also said the descriptions of Russia\u2019s actions are \u201cso generic as to be almost meaningless.\u201d\u00a0\u201cWe can trust the American people with knowing what to do with the information they receive and making those decisions for themselves. But they cannot do so if they\u2019re kept in the dark about what our adversaries are doing, and how they are doing it,\u201d the lawmakers said. \u201cWhen it comes to American elections, Americans must decide.\u201dADMore from Schumer:Republicans shot back that the Democrats were \u201cpoliticizing intelligence\u201d and hyping up the threat.\u00a0\u201cWe are confident that while the threat remains, we are far better prepared than four years ago,\u201d Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), acting chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said. \u201cThe intelligence community, law enforcement, election officials, and others involved in securing our elections are far better postured, and Congress dramatically better informed, than any of us were in 2016 \u2014 and our Democrat colleagues know it.\u201dADThey also accused Democrats of unfairly attacking Evanina, though the Democratic statement didn\u2019t criticize the intelligence leader personally.\u00a0\u201cWe believe the statement baselessly impugns his character and politicizes intelligence matters,\u201d the lawmakers said. \u201cTheir manufactured complaint undercuts Director Evanina\u2019s nonpartisan public outreach to increase Americans\u2019 awareness of foreign influence campaigns right at the beginning of his efforts.\u201d\u00a0State officials are also growing frustrated with limited information about election threats coming from the administration.\u00a0During a meeting of state election officials last week, Colorado Secretary of State Jena Griswold (D) criticized the Department of Homeland Security for not sharing enough information about foreign disinformation operations targeting elections. When DHS does share that information with state officials, it\u2019s often under conditions that bar them from sharing it with voters, she told me after the conference.\u00a0ADAD\u201cThe federal government has not led in a meaningful way on this,\u201d she said.\u00a0DHS\u2019s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency tries to get as much information about election threats to state officials and the public as it can, CISA Senior Adviser on Election Security Matt Masterson told me in an email. But he acknowledged intelligence community rules sometimes make transparency difficult.\u00a0\u201cWe agree\u00a0on the need for transparency regarding risks to elections, including about disinformation,\u201d he said. \u201cCISA routinely pushes timely and actionable information to our election partners, and we will continue to advocate on their behalf with our intelligence community colleagues in order to get more information downgraded and shared as broadly as possible.\u201dADThe comments reflect a long-standing conflict between intelligence agencies and other parts of the federal government that rely on information those agencies provide.\u00a0ADIn this case, it\u2019s in CISA\u2019s interest to broadly release information about Russian interference so it\u2019s easier to combat phony information and ensure elections run smoothly. But intelligence agencies are wary of making too much information public because they fear that would risk revealing their secret sources.That dearth of public information makes it more likely voters will fall prey to phony social media posts or information that's hacked and leaked by U.S. adversaries, Griswold warned. And it\u2019s tougher for Democrats to sound alarm bells when the federal government isn\u2019t backing them up because they risk being accused of making partisan attacks, she said. \u00a0AD\u201cThis needs to be done in a bipartisan way with state and federal buy in because, without that, people can say, \u2018You\u2019re a Democrat; it\u2019s not true,\u2019 \u201d she said.\u00a0The keysRepublicans are steering clear of online voting at their convention even as part of the proceedings go digital.\u00a0The Republican National Committee is planning to manage all its convention voting with just 336 delegates \u2014 six from each U.S. state and territory \u2014 who will all be at the physical convention space in Charlotte, a spokeswoman tells me.ADThose delegates will vote for themselves and cast ballots on behalf of other delegates who aren\u2019t physically present for the party\u2019s presidential and vice-presidential nominations. There\u2019s little drama about the outcome of that vote because President Trump\u2019s only challenger for the nomination, former Massachusetts governor Bill Weld, won only a single delegate before dropping out of the race.ADFor some other votes about convention business, the 336 delegates will be the only people authorized to vote, the spokeswoman said.Democrats, by contrast, are allowing delegates to cast votes by email during their virtual convention. That plan raises the risk of hackers manipulating some votes, cybersecurity experts warn. But the danger is far less than during an actual election because delegates don\u2019t cast their votes secretly and can verify they were recorded correctly.ADTrump had pushed for a full and raucous Republican convention in Jacksonville, Fla., but backed off as coronavirus infections surged in the state.\u00a0Zuckerberg plans to play on fears of Chinese tech at antitrust hearing.\u00a0The Facebook CEO will stress at a House Judiciary hearing that congressional moves that weaken U.S. companies such as Facebook could give Chinese firms an advantage, Sarah Frier at Bloomberg News reports.\u00a0ADThe argument could play well with China hawks who argue that Chinese companies pose a risk to democracies because they're limited by the country's strong censorship laws and could become tools of Beijing spying. Many\u00a0have pushed for the United States to invest in\u00a0American technology to better compete with Chinese alternatives.\u00a0The Facebook chief executive has made similar arguments in previous speeches, singling out the social media app TikTok. The White House is considering banning the Chinese-owned app over security concerns. Both the House and Senate have passed measures banning it at federal agencies.The Biden campaign is banning staffers from using TikTok on their phones.The order reaffirms guidance from the Democratic National Committee that campaign staff should not use the Chinese app, a campaign official confirmed.

Subscribe today.arrow-rightDickson Jun Wei Yeo, 39, a doctoral degree candidate at the National University of Singapore\u2019s Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy, pleaded guilty as charged in a one-count June 11 criminal information before U.S. District Judge Tanya S. Chutkan.In plea papers, Yeo admitted trying to cultivate relationships with Americans \u2014 including U.S. government and military officials with high-level security clearances \u2014 since 2015 while serving in academic posts at Singapore\u2019s top university and at George Washington University in D.C. According to court documents, Yeo identified those with \u201cnonpublic information\u201d of value to Chinese intelligence.ADAD\u201cYes, your honor, I am guilty,\u201d Yeo said during a hearing after striking a plea deal with U.S. prosecutors that includes deportation after prison. The charge carries a maximum 10-year term, although as a first offender, Yeo would likely receive far less time at sentencing Oct. 9. He remains in custody after being arrested in November upon return to a U.S. airport from overseas, court filings said.The case comes as the Justice Department has prioritized countering Chinese national security threats since 2018, including the alleged widespread theft of industry and government secrets. Yeo\u2019s case shows how Beijing can exploit non-Chinese nationals, the Internet and the openness of American society to directly target financially vulnerable officials in the federal government\u2019s backyard, acting U.S. attorney Michael R. Sherwin of the District said in announcing the plea with the Justice Department\u2019s national security division.According to court filings, Yeo initially began targeting other Asian countries, before focusing on the United States under orders from several contacts in Chinese intelligence services. Four contacts approached him after he gave a presentation in Beijing in 2015 on the political situation in Southeast Asia, court filings said.ADADAlthough Yeo refused to sign a contract with the People\u2019s Liberation Army, he worked with operatives to pay American targets to write reports for \u201cclients in Asia\u201d without revealing their work was going to the Chinese government, he said in a sworn statement of offense. At the operatives\u2019 direction, he admitted, he set up and posted job listings in 2018 for a fake consulting firm, Resolute Consulting of Singapore, the same name as a prominent U.S. public and government relations firm.Yeo received more than 400 r\u00e9sum\u00e9s \u2014 90 percent from U.S. military and government personnel with security clearances \u2014 and he forward some to his handlers, he told U.S. investigators, according to court documents.Yeo also mined a professional networking website \u2014 unnamed in court filings but confirmed as LinkedIn, a person familiar with the case said \u2014 to find individuals with promising r\u00e9sum\u00e9s and job descriptions for recruitment.ADADFBI Washington field office head Timothy R. Slater reminded U.S. citizens, \u201cespecially those holding security clearances, to be cautious when being approached by individuals on social media sites with implausible career opportunities.\u201dSpokesmen for the Chinese Embassy in Washington did not respond to a request for comment. A GWU spokeswoman confirmed that Yeo was a visiting scholar for six months in 2019 but had no employment or student relationship, nor did he receive any kind of funding from the university.Yeo used his time as a GWU fellow from January to July 2019 to network with individuals with lobbying firms and defense contractors at events and think tank talks, according to the statement of offense.ADUnder the direction of Chinese intelligence, he said, he was instructed to spot targets in sensitive positions who were dissatisfied with their work or having financial difficulties.ADJust as Yeo was recruited by intelligence contacts who claimed to represent China-based think tanks and offered money in exchange for political reports and information, his contacts tasked him to approach his American targets for \u201cscuttlebutt\u201d about international political, economic and diplomatic matters.Yeo admitted paying $1,000 or $2,000 to one such State Department employee to write about a sitting U.S. Cabinet member in 2018 or 2019.Yeo also recruited an American civilian with a high-level security clearance who worked on the U.S. Air Force\u2019s F-35B fighter program to write a report and discuss the implications of Japanese purchases, according to his plea. Yeo contacted him through LinkedIn, according to court records and the person familiar with the case, and the civilian confided to having money problems.ADADYeo paid at least $2,000 to a U.S. Army officer posted at the Pentagon who said he was traumatized by his military tours in Afghanistan to write a report about how the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan would impact China, according to plea papers. Yeo did not disclose that the work would be given to the Beijing government, filings said.Yeo traveled frequently to China to meet with operatives, his offense statement said, and he was told by one of them that authorities wanted to conceal his identity after he complained that he was regularly pulled out of the customs line and taken to a separate office for admission.Yeo returned to the United States in November, planning to ask the Army officer to provide classified information and to reveal he was working for the Chinese government, the plea statement said. Instead, he was stopped on arrival by law enforcement, questioned and eventually arrested.\n\nU.S. accuses China of sponsoring criminal hackers targeting coronavirus vaccine researchFBI director says China seeks to compromise U.S. firms researching coronavirusScrutiny of Chinese American scientists raises fears of ethnic profiling", "comment": "0 Comments", "topic": "Legal Issues"}, {"cover": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/LRMSRTGNHQI6VGNQQQTOE3JAHM.jpghttps://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/LRMSRTGNHQI6VGNQQQTOE3JAHM.jpg", "title": "The Cybersecurity 202: Drone vulnerabilities add to U.S.- spying tensions", "date": "Jul 24, 2020", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/07/24/cybersecurity-202-drone-vulnerabilities-add-us-china-spying-tensions/", "keyword": "China and Security", "website": "the Washington Post", "author": "Joseph Marks", "content": "with Tonya RileyResearchers are warning about cybersecurity vulnerabilities in an Android app that powers a popular Chinese-made drone they say could help the Chinese government scoop up reams of information.\u00a0Support our journalism.

The concerns have deepened during the coronavirus pandemic and are threatening to create a permanent fissure between Western and Chinese technology.ADThe vulnerability could allow DJI, the world\u2019s largest drone maker, or someone with access to its computer systems, to grab information from the microphones, cameras, contacts and even locations of hundreds of thousands of drone owners worldwide, the cybersecurity firms Grimm and Synacktiv found.\u00a0ADThe company is also able to send automatic updates to the apps without Google or the drone owner consenting or even necessarily knowing the app is being updated, researchers found. Theoretically that update function could be used to load the phones with malware that could send troves of data back to China, they said.\u00a0The feature is only present in Android apps used by consumer drone owners, not in the version used by companies and government agencies. It's also not present in the iPhone version of the app.\u00a0Yet the alarm comes as DJI is already under intense scrutiny by China hawks and some U.S. officials. The Pentagon banned the company\u2019s drones in 2017 over spying concerns and the Interior Department grounded its fleet of about 800 DJI drones in January. Lawmakers are seeking to ban them across the rest of the federal government and to root them out from state and local governments as well. DJI has said those bans are about politics, not security.The new reports don\u2019t include smoking-gun evidence against DJI.\u00a0There\u2019s no proof the app has been used to steal any information so far or to hand anything over to Beijing.\u00a0ADADA DJI spokesman told the New York Times the auto update feature is there to ensure drone hobbyists don\u2019t hack the system so they can break government rules about where they can fly drones and how high. \u201cIf a hacked version is detected, users are prompted to download the official version from our website,\u201d spokesman Brendan Schulman said.\u00a0DJI\u2019s ability to directly update the Android app may also be a workaround because of policies that block Google inside China, the Times\u2019s Paul Mozur, Julian E. Barnes and Aaron Krolik report.\u00a0But the absence of evidence of Chinese spying shouldn\u2019t be taken as proof it\u2019s not happening, U.S. officials warn.\u00a0Indeed, they frequently argue Chinese companies are effectively arms of the government and would be powerless to refuse an order from Beijing to turn over sensitive data.\u00a0ADAD\u201cEvery Chinese technology company is required by Chinese law to provide information they obtain, or information stored on their networks, to Chinese authorities if requested to do so,\u201d William R. Evanina, director of the National Counterintelligence and Security Center, told the Times. \u201cAll Americans should be concerned that their images, biometrics, locational and other data stored on Chinese apps must be turned over to China\u2019s state security apparatus.\u201dThat\u2019s effectively the same argument U.S. officials made to justify a slew of harsh restrictions against Huawei, including banning it from government computer networks and next-generation 5G phone and Internet systems. It also has proved somewhat effective in a U.S. diplomatic campaign urging allies to similarly restrict the company.\u00a0U.S. officials are ramping up their warnings about the threat of major cyberattacks from adversary nations.\u00a0ADADThe Department of Homeland Security and the National Security Agency issued a joint alert warning adversaries are eager to attack the Internet-connected components of critical industries such as energy plants and defense contractors.\u00a0\u201cAs we\u2019ve said many times, our adversaries are capable, imaginative and aim to disrupt essential services, so it is important that we make sure we are staying ahead of them.\" Bryan Ware, assistant director of DHS\u2019s cybersecurity division, said.\u00a0The keysThe Senate passed a major defense bill that includes $1 billion to help U.S. firms compete with Huawei.The Senate version of the defense policy bill also includes:ADMore federal money to help the United States compete with China's computer chip industry.An amendment requiring DHS to establish a cybersecurity state coordinator position in every state.Provisions recommended by the Cyberspace Solarium Commission requiring defense contractors to participate in cyberthreat intelligence-sharing programs and that give greater powers to DHS's cybersecurity division.A provision that gives DHS legal power to uncover the identities of companies being targeted by cyberattacks so it can warn them and recommend better protections.The bill did not include a provision that's in the House version and would have created a cyber director position at the White House. A provision from Sen. Mark R. Warner (D-Va.), which\u00a0would have required campaigns to report foreign efforts to interfere in a presidential election, was also dropped from the bill. President Trump has said he might listen if other nations offered him dirt on his opponents.ADThe House and Senate must now craft a compromise version of the annual bill before sending it to the president.\u00a0A victim of Twitter\u2019s monumental breach says it might have exposed his private messages with political dissidents.\u00a0Dutch Lawmaker Geert Wilders was among 130 people whose Twitter accounts were taken over by hackers. He was also among a smaller group informed by Twitter that hackers had accessed his direct messages, he told Toby Sterling at Reuters. The fiercely anti-Islamic politician said that his inbox contained private messages from dissidents in the Middle East who could be in danger if the messages were revealed.AD\u201cI do hope they will not be in danger if their identity would be exposed because of this hack,\u201d he said.The story highlights the damage hackers could cause with such an attack if they had broad access to prominent people's private messages. Other accounts the hackers compromised belonged to Joe Biden, Barack Obama, Bill Gates and Elon Musk.ADTwitter did not confirm that Wilders was among the 36 account owners whose messages hackers viewed but did say one of the accounts belonged to \u201can elected official in the Netherlands.\u201dTwitter CEO Jack Dorsey apologized for the hack on an earnings call yesterday,\u00a0Rachel Lerman reports.\u201cSecurity doesn\u2019t have an end point.

Nixon after touring the museum and library that honors the former president. Then, speaking to a few hundred socially distanced guests near Nixon\u2019s boyhood home, Pompeo announced a bold new chapter in the United States\u2019 relationship with the People\u2019s Republic of China.ADAlmost 50 years after Nixon dispatched his national security adviser, Henry Kissinger, on a secret mission to Beijing, Pompeo brought down the curtain on the blind hope that China would simply evolve into a western-style democracy.AD\u201cThis isn\u2019t about containment,\u201d Pompeo declared on Thursday. \u201cDon\u2019t buy that. It\u2019s about a complex new challenge that we\u2019ve never faced before. The U.S.S.R. was closed off from the free world. Communist China is already within our borders.\u201dThere was an urgency to Pompeo\u2019s message: \u201cSecuring our freedoms from the Chinese Communist Party is the mission of our time, and America is perfectly positioned to lead it because our founding principles give us that opportunity.\u201dADThe urgency comes because of the age of artificial intelligence in which we live. Click by click, app by app, TikTok by TikTok, the CCP races to achieve domination and to exploit its leverage. Its immense market of 1.4 billion consumers dazzles the eyes of free-market companies seeking customers.Pompeo warned bluntly that this is not just a mirage, but a trap. \u201cWe must admit a hard truth that should guide us in the years and decades to come, that if we want to have a free 21st century, and not the Chinese century of which Xi Jinping dreams, the old paradigm of blind engagement with China simply won\u2019t get it done.\u201dADPompeo then named companies that had their priorities backward. \u201cMarriott, American Airlines, Delta, United,\u201d Pompeo said, \u201call removed references to Taiwan from their corporate websites, so as not to anger Beijing.\u201dAD\u201cHollywood, not too far from here,\u201d Pompeo continued, \u201cthe epicenter of American creative freedom and self-appointed arbiters of social justice, self-censors even the most mildly unfavorable reference to China.\u201dAll of this must end, Pompeo demanded, and then called for an extended era of relentless, unsparing candor about the People\u2019s Republic of China in the hope of transforming that communist country. Pompeo repeated that the CCP remains a completely communist regime.Full disclosure: I am the president of the Richard Nixon Foundation and accompanied the secretary on his visit. That said, I believe it is fair to say that this was a speech that will be seen as pivotal by foreign policy historians for years to come.ADADIt is a speech that ought to be read by every American and especially by every American CEO. Leaders of both parties should applaud and embrace this commitment to candor.

Subscribe today.arrow-rightOvernight, Hong Kong\u2019s 7.5 million residents were put under the same speech restrictions as the mainland, with possible life imprisonment for those deemed guilty of subversion \u2014 a standard charge used to jail political dissidents and human rights activists in China. Still, tens of thousands braved arrest Wednesday to protest in defiance as Beijing dismantles their freedoms.Equally striking in China\u2019s move was the realpolitik logic underlying the new law: It signaled that China sees no need to abide by international agreements it made from a position of weakness in earlier years as a poorer nation. The law asserted extraterritorial jurisdiction over critics of Beijing anywhere in the world \u2014 potentially ensnaring those who set foot in Hong Kong.In a speech last week, U.S. national security adviser Robert O\u2019Brien called Washington\u2019s miscalculation of China\u2019s political trajectory the \u201cgreatest failure of American foreign policy since the 1930s.\u201d This week\u2019s passage of the Hong Kong security law is one of the clearest illustrations that Beijing is seeking to become a world power on its own terms instead of following the West\u2019s rule book.ADAD\u201cOf course we\u2019re not afraid,\u201d Zhang Xiaoming, executive director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, said of Washington\u2019s retaliatory sanctions. \u201cThe era when the Chinese cared what others thought and looked up to others is in the past, never to return.\u201dChina\u2019s new security law sends chill through Hong KongSpeaking at a news conference Wednesday, he called the law a \u201cbirthday present\u201d for Hong Kong \u2014 it took effect exactly 23 years after China regained the territory from Britain \u2014 and said it would serve as a \u201cguardian angel\u201d that would restore the protest-racked city\u2019s prosperity and stability.Hours later, thousands of residents filled the streets, shouting pro-democracy and independence slogans, scrawling graffiti and building barricades to hold back police. Malls, shops and restaurants closed and traffic snarled, reminiscent of the chaotic scenes the law was meant to eliminate.Hong Kong\u2019s venerable Foreign Correspondents\u2019 Club is a port in a stormBeijing, which under a 1984 Sino-British joint declaration had promised to preserve Hong Kong\u2019s freedoms until 2047, has been intent on projecting an appearance of rule of law throughout its imposition of the security measures. While the central government had threatened last year to deploy mainland troops into Hong Kong to crush sometimes-violent pro-democracy protests, it ultimately held back, relying on municipal police to handle the crisis.But now Beijing has codified broad new powers for itself in Hong Kong, which means that going forward, it can send in troops without a request from local officials, extradite residents to the mainland and conduct surveillance on political opponents in the city while asserting it is following the letter of the law.ADADAt the Wednesday news conference, Shen Chunyao, director of the legislative affairs commission for the National People\u2019s Congress standing committee, stressed that Beijing adhered to correct procedures in passing the law, despite bypassing Hong Kong\u2019s legislature and skipping the public comment period due to the issue\u2019s \u201csensitivity.\u201d\u201cOur nation\u2019s legislative process was strictly followed,\u201d he said, adding that the central government sought feedback quietly from Hong Kong officials and business executives during the law\u2019s drafting.No compromiseChina has made other geopolitical maneuvers in recent weeks as other nations remain preoccupied with the coronavirus pandemic and the United States reckons with a painful history of police violence and institutionalized racism. Twenty Indian troops were killed last month in border clashes with Chinese soldiers, the most serious conflict between the nuclear-armed neighbors in decades.ADADBeijing also said last month it will bring formal espionage charges against Canadians Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig, a year and a half after they were detained in what was widely seen as retribution for the arrest in Canada of Meng Wanzhou, chief financial officer of the Huawei technology conglomerate. Meng was detained by Canadian authorities at the request of the United States, which is seeking her extradition on fraud charges.The Hong Kong security law carries undertones of the Huawei incident, setting up an extradition mechanism for people in Hong Kong \u2014 a high-traffic flight-transfer hub \u2014 to the mainland. Indeed, it was a government proposal last year to allow extraditions to the mainland that kicked off months of clashes in Hong Kong between police and demonstrators.China enacts Hong Kong security law, escalating confrontation with U.S.Shen said that \u201ca very small number of cases where there is severe harm to national security\u201d would be handled by central authorities instead of Hong Kong authorities. In those cases, Beijing\u2019s top judges would designate a court to handle the case \u2014 a pathway for extradition to the mainland if they select a mainland court.ADADAddressing reporters Wednesday, Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam quoted Chinese leader Xi Jinping, arguing that her city had forgotten the principle of the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d framework \u2014 stressing the primacy of \u201cone country.\u201d\u201cWe have not done a good job in terms of educating our young people about our history and our country,\u201d she said. \u201cThat has led to risk and danger.\u201dHong Kong\u2019s secretary for security, speaking at the same news conference, added that the city\u2019s police would be primarily responsible for implementing the law.In London, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said his government would open a pathway to citizenship for some 3.3 million Hong Kong residents who hold or are eligible for British National (Overseas), or BNO, passports, a legacy of British colonial rule in Hong Kong.ADADThe \u201cbespoke immigration path,\u201d the U.K. government said, was a response to the new national security laws, which Britain believes constitutes a \u201cclear and serious breach of the Sino-British declaration,\u201d Johnson said.Foiling dissentAs they spoke, thousands descended on the Causeway Bay district to protest the crackdown. The area is always boisterous on July 1, the handover anniversary, and usually features peaceful marches and political booths lining the streets.This time, even before crowds could fully gather, police officers were stationed on almost every corner. Police hoisted a new purple flag \u2014 warning that those massing faced arrest for displaying \u201cflags or banners/chanting slogans\u201d that could violate the new law \u2014 before moving to clear the streets.ADOfficers fired a water cannon, deployed tear gas and pepper balls and blocked roads and subway exits. Officers fired pepper spray into crowds, including at reporters wearing clearly marked vests.ADStill, protesters at times managed to occupy roads and march through neighboring districts, shouting \u201cHong Kong independence, the only way out\u201d and other chants that now risk heavy jail sentences.Escalating Huawei feud, China indicts two Canadians in spying caseHong Kong police announced they had made their first arrests under the new security law. A man was found with a flag that said \u201cHong Kong independence\u201d in large lettering. (The flag had two tiny Chinese characters, which could be read to add \u201cno to\u201d before \u201cHong Kong independence.\u201d)ADPolice said calls for independence \u2014 a once-fringe idea that has gained traction in recent months \u2014 could amount to inciting others to commit secession, an act punishable under the security law.By evening, police had arrested about 370 people, including at least 10 suspected of violating the new law. Others were charged for illegal assembly, public disorder and possessing offensive weapons.AD\u201cThere are some saying that they will continue their fight, but it does not matter,\u201d Lam added in the news conference. \u201cBecause we have the law now, and we will strongly enforce it.\u201d\n\n\n\nChina\u2019s security law sends chill through Hong Kong, 23 years after handoverChina enacts Hong Kong security law, escalating confrontation with U.S.Escalating Huawei feud, China indicts two Canadians in spying case", "comment": "209 Comments", "topic": "Asia & Pacific"}, {"cover": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/OEVXSOGNMYI6VEPRFCWKJWBTUA.jpghttps://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/OEVXSOGNMYI6VEPRFCWKJWBTUA.jpg", "title": " tells U.S. to shut consulate in Chengdu, in retaliation for Houston closure", "date": "Jul 24, 2020", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/china-tells-us-to-shut-consulate-in-chengdu-in-retaliation-for-houston-order/2020/07/24/839108d0-cd62-11ea-99b0-8426e26d203b_story.html", "keyword": "China and Security", "website": "the Washington Post", "author": "Anna FifieldCarol MorelloEllen Nakashima", "content": "BEIJING \u2014 China on Friday ordered the United States to shut its consulate in Chengdu in response to the American closure of China\u2019s equivalent branch in Houston, another escalation in the dispute between the world\u2019s two largest economies.Support our journalism.

Nixon began overtures to the People\u2019s Republic of China, leading to the start of formal diplomatic relations in 1979.As if to signal an end to that era, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo delivered a speech at the Richard Nixon Presidential Library and Museum in Yorba Linda, Calif., on Thursday, in which he declared American engagement with China a dismal failure.\u201cThe old paradigm of blind engagement with China simply won\u2019t get it done. We must not continue it. We must not return to it,\u201d Pompeo said. \u201cToday, China is increasingly authoritarian at home, and more aggressive in its hostility to freedom everywhere else. .\u2009.\u2009. If the free world doesn\u2019t change Communist China, Communist China will change us.\u201dChina had vowed to retaliate after the United States on Tuesday ordered it to close its Houston consulate by Friday.ADADU.S. officials said the decision to move against the facility was made because while some degree of espionage is normal and expected, Houston was particularly active in facilitating the theft of scientific and technological material.\u201cThe sum total of the Houston consulate\u2019s activities went well over the line of what we are willing to accept,\u201d the Justice official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive issues. \u201cAnd unless we disrupted it, it threatened to become even more aggressive in Houston and in other Chinese consulates nationwide.\u201dPersonnel at the consulate recruited people for the Thousand Talents Program, which pays researchers overseas to aid China\u2019s modernization, in part by stealing intellectual property at companies and universities, the officials said. Consulate officials directed the researchers what information to collect, the official said.ADADThe official  noted that the FBI had arrested a network of Chinese who concealed their affiliation with the People\u2019s Liberation Army in applying for visas to conduct research in the United States. One of those arrested was holed up in the Chinese consulate in San Francisco until Thursday night and has a court appearance on Friday, the official said.Chinese consulates also are bases of operations for \u201cFox Hunt\u201d teams of agents sent from China to coerce economic fugitives or political rivals of President Xi Jinping to return to China, according to the official.Beijing has been implicated in the vast majority of counterintelligence investigations by U.S. law enforcement authorities.ADThe FBI has seen a 1,300 percent increase in cases of economic espionage related to China over the last decade, said a U.S. intelligence official. About 60 percent of the cases prosecuted involve China, the Justice official said. A senior intelligence official, also speaking on the condition of anonymity, said about 80 percent of the 2,000 active intelligence probes are tied to China. A new investigation into China\u2019s activities is opened every 10 hours on average, the official said.AD\u201cThe decision to close the consulate in Houston reflects our long-standing concerns, but also patient U.S. diplomacy,\u201d said a senior State Department official, who also spoke on the condition of anonymity. \u201cWe\u2019re positive, optimistic people. But there comes a time when you have to say, enough is enough.Some analysts thought that China would respond to the shutdown of its post in Houston by closing the U.S. Consulate in Wuhan, which has been empty since the novel coronavirus outbreak spread across the city in January and appears unlikely to reopen soon.ADInstead, Beijing took aim at the post in Chengdu, a southwestern city staffed by about 15 American diplomats that hosts political, economic and agricultural departments and the Chengdu American Center, and issues visas.The consul general in Chengdu is Jim Mullinax, a diplomat who has spent most of his career in Asia, serving in Indonesia, the Philippines, Indonesia, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Shanghai.ADMore than 13 million people were watching state broadcaster CCTV\u2019s live stream from outside the Chengdu mission at lunchtime Friday. Photos posted on Chinese social media showed a heavy police presence around the compound on Consulate Road, and crowds of people gathering to see what was happening.In announcing the mission\u2019s closure, China\u2019s Foreign Ministry in a statement blamed the Trump administration for bringing diplomacy into the countries\u2019 wider rivalry and described Beijing\u2019s response as legitimate and necessary.AD\u201cThe current situation between China and the United States is something China does not want to see, and the responsibility rests entirely with the United States,\u201d the ministry continued. \u201cWe once again urge the U.S. to immediately revoke the erroneous decision to create necessary conditions for the return of bilateral relations to normal.\u201dADThe closure will make it more difficult for U.S. officials to engage with ordinary Chinese citizens, which the State Department takes care to differentiate from the issues it has with the government. But U.S. officials said that was not a reason to stay silent.\u201cThis is about making things right,\u201d the senior State Department official said. \u201cForty years of broken glass needs be swept up and put back in order. And given the national security strategy of finally acknowledging that this really is a strategic competition, we\u2019re going to do that.\u201dThe U.S. Embassy in Beijing did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but later Friday it reissued travel guidance to Americans in China, warning them of arbitrary enforcement of local laws \u201cfor purposes other than maintaining law and order,\u201d potentially involving detention and the use of exit bans.The consulate\u2019s geographic area of responsibility covers Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou provinces, as well as Chongqing city and the Tibet Autonomous Region.ADADAs it looks for new ways to confront China, the Trump administration has taken aim at Beijing\u2019s restrictions on Tibet, which the Communist Party keeps under tight control. The administration this month said it was limiting visas for an unspecified number of Chinese officials because Beijing obstructs access to Tibet by American diplomats and other officials, journalists and tourists. Only once has the U.S. ambassador to China  been granted permission to travel to Tibet and view the situation firsthand, said the State Department official.Asked why Chengdu was chosen, Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said Friday that some of the personnel there had \u201cinterfered in China\u2019s internal affairs and harmed China\u2019s national security interests,\u201d an apparent reference to American officials\u2019 interest in Tibet.\n\n\n\n\n\nMorello and Nakashima reported from Washington.

If the free world doesn\u2019t change Communist China, Communist China will change us.\u201dPompeo\u2019s remarks at the Nixon Presidential Library and Museum in Yorba Linda, Calif., came nearly half a century after President Richard M. Nixon pursued an opening of diplomatic relations with Beijing, and were intended to delineate a sharp break in decades of U.S. policy that Trump aides have described as too lenient.The speech followed addresses from other top Trump aides \u2014 national security adviser Robert C. O\u2019Brien, Attorney General William P. Barr and FBI Director Christopher A. Wray \u2014 who delivered their own indictments of China this month in a coordinated effort to emphasize the administration\u2019s determination to confront Beijing on a wide array of issues.ADADYet the timing of the tougher strategy, coming less than four months before the presidential election, has alarmed Trump\u2019s critics. They questioned whether the president\u2019s eagerness to blame China for the pandemic \u2014 and paint Democratic rival Joe Biden as weak on Beijing \u2014 has led the administration to lash out without thinking through the consequences, an approach one Capitol Hill aide privately termed the \u201cburn it all down phase\u201d of its China policy.\u201cI am deeply concerned that the administration\u2019s approach is one that labors under the mistaken belief that just being confrontational is the same thing as being competitive,\u201d Sen. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.) told Stephen Biegun, Pompeo\u2019s top deputy, at a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing on China this week.Menendez agreed that the U.S. policy must get tougher and said he is working on a bill with fellow Democrats, but he added that \u201cbeing tough is the means, not the ends,\u201d and asked what the administration will do if Beijing follows through on threats to retaliate for the closure of the Houston consulate.ADADBiegun responded that U.S. policymakers have \u201cinvested quite a bit over the last three decades\u201d in trying to coax China into becoming a responsible international stakeholder, only to be betrayed.\u201cSometimes, wishful outcomes are hard to let go of, and many have not,\u201d he told lawmakers. \u201cThis administration has been equally criticized for moving too abruptly or too harshly or for precipitating a new Cold War, which is not our intention.\u201dInside the White House, there are signs that the emerging China strategy remains a work in progress. One White House ally said the series of speeches from Trump aides was prompted by concern among his political advisers that the president \u2014 while attacking Biden for being inconsistent on China \u2014 was himself facing criticism for having vacillated in his approach.ADAD\u201cSomebody pointed out, \u2018We look like we\u2019re flip-flopping ourselves,\u2019\u2009\u201d said this person, who is in semi-regular contact with Trump aides and spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss their private conversations. The person added that Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who has more-moderate views on China, declined a request to deliver his own address.And even as Trump has blamed China for failing to contain the virus, which originated in the city of Wuhan, he has continued to refrain from the kind of sweeping rhetoric used by some of his aides to denounce a string of Chinese offenses.During a Rose Garden news conference two weeks ago, Trump announced that he would sign an executive order to punish China for its imposition of a strict new national security law in Hong Kong. But he spent most of the hour-long event bashing Biden and touting his record in a stream-of-consciousness monologue that resembled a campaign speech.ADADAt a news conference this week, Trump suggested he remained willing to collaborate with Beijing if Chinese researchers are the first to develop an effective vaccine for the coronavirus. He was also relatively muted when asked if his administration would consider shutting down other Chinese compounds in the United States.\u201cIt\u2019s always possible,\u201d he replied.Though Trump came to office projecting a tougher edge on China, his pursuit of a bilateral trade deal \u2014 and his related unwillingness to personally criticize President Xi Jinping or forcefully confront Beijing on human rights \u2014 undercuts efforts within the administration to develop a comprehensive strategy.ADLast month, Trump\u2019s former national security adviser John Bolton asserted in a White House memoir that the president attempted to convince Xi that China\u2019s purchase of more U.S. goods would help Trump win reelection, and that the president told Xi in a private discussion that he was justified in building detention camps for \u00adUighur Muslims.ADBut trade talks have broken off amid the pandemic and Trump has not spoken with Xi since March, providing an opening for China hard-liners within the administration.In Grand Rapids, Mich., last week, Barr inveighed against Chinese surveillance and censorship, and faulted Google, Apple, Microsoft and Yahoo for collaborating with the Communist Party and becoming \u201cpawns of Chinese influence.\u201d Pompeo, who has lobbied U.S. allies to follow the administration\u2019s efforts to ban Chinese 5G telecom giant Huawei, has floated potentially banning Chinese-owned technology apps, including the popular TikTok, a social media platform.ADThe State Department issued a statement this month aligning the United States with an international tribunal\u2019s ruling four years ago that China\u2019s encroachment on disputed shipping lanes in the South China Sea was \u201cunlawful.\u201dADIn his remarks at the Nixon Library, attended by a handful of Chinese political dissidents, Pompeo accused Xi of being \u201ca true believer in a bankrupt totalitarian ideology\u201d that \u201cinforms his decades-long desire for global hegemony built on Chinese communism.\u201dMichael Pillsbury, a China analyst at the conservative Hudson Institute, said Trump, despite his long-standing concerns about China\u2019s unfair trade and intellectual property theft, had not fully endorsed an expansive indictment of the Chinese political system.AD\u201cThis is a new area for the president,\u201d said Pillsbury, who lauded the administration\u2019s \u201cdramatic reappraisal\u201d of the bilateral relationship in an op-ed Thursday.But Trump\u2019s critics faulted the administration for failing to promote an alternative U.S. leadership model abroad. During the Senate committee hearing this week, Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) said Trump\u2019s declared \u201cAmerica first\u201d policy had left all nations free to \u201cpursue their own interests\u201d rather than develop a coordinated response to Chinese aggression.ADAnd Sen. Tom Udall (D-N.M.) cited the administration\u2019s use of federal agents to employ tear gas and make arrests amid protests in Portland, Ore., and asked Biegun whether the United States was \u201cfacing more accusations of hypocrisy\u201d in criticizing China over its actions in Hong Kong.Biegun allowed that the United States is going through an \u201cuncomfortable moment,\u201d but he rejected the comparison and said the administration\u2019s effort to maintain order \u201cdoes not indict our democracy.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of this article misidentified the affiliation of Michael Pillsbury.

The United States is responsible for all this,\u201d Wang said. \u201cWe once again urge the United States to immediately retract its wrong decision and create necessary conditions for bringing the bilateral relationship back on track.\u201dWang said some consulate personnel \u201cinterfered in China\u2019s internal affairs and harmed China\u2019s security interests\u201d but gave no details. He said Beijing complained \u201cmany times\u201d to Washington about that.ADAlso Friday, the U.S. State Department sent out a notice warning Americans in China of a \u201cheightened risk of arbitrary detention.\u201dAD\u201cU.S. citizens may be subjected to prolonged interrogations and extended detention for reasons related to \u2018state security,\u2019\u201d the notice said.Americans may be detained or deported for \u201csending private electronic messages critical\u201d of the Chinese government, it said. The notice gave no indication of what prompted the warning.On Tuesday, the Trump administration ordered the Houston consulate closed within 72 hours. It alleged Chinese agents tried to steal data from facilities including the Texas A&M medical system.The ministry on Thursday rejected the allegations as \u201cmalicious slander.\u201d It warned the Houston consulate\u2019s closure was \u201cbreaking down the bridge of friendship\u201d between the two countries.ADThe United States has an embassy in Beijing and consulates in five other mainland cities \u2014 Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chengdu, Shenyang and Wuhan. It also has a consulate in Hong Kong, a Chinese territory.ADThe consulate in Chengdu is responsible for monitoring Tibet and other areas in the southwest inhabited by nonethnic Chinese minorities that are considered especially sensitive by Beijing.Asian stock markets, already uneasy about the uncertain pace of recovery from the coronavirus pandemic, fell Friday on the news of the closure.China\u2019s market benchmark, the Shanghai Composite Index, lost 3.9%. Hong Kong\u2019s main index declined 2.2%.\u201cAlongside the eviction of the Houston Chinese Consulate, the risk of the U.S.-China conflict escalating into a \u2018Cold War\u2019 is worrying,\u201d Hayaki Narita of Mizuho Bank said in a report.ADThe consulate in Chengdu was in the news in 2012 when Wang Lijun, the police chief of the major city of Chongqing, visited and told American officials his concerns about the death of a British business associate of the wife of Chongqing\u2019s Communist Party secretary, Bo Xilai.ADThat prompted the British Embassy to ask for a new investigation, which led to the arrest and conviction of Bo\u2019s wife. Bo was later dismissed and sentenced to prison.The consulate was surrounded by police while Wang was inside. He later emerged and was arrested and sentenced to 15 years on charges of corruption and defection. The U.S. government has refused to confirm whether Wang asked for asylum.ADIn March, American reporters for The New York Times, The Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal were expelled from China. That was in response to the Trump administration\u2019s decision to limit the number of U.S. visas for Chinese employees of state media.Operations of nine Chinese state media outlets in the United States have been required to register as \u201cforeign missions\u201d due to their ties with the ruling Communist Party. That doesn\u2019t affect their ability to conduct reporting but requires them to report their staff and real estate holdings as they would if they were embassies.ADAlso Thursday, the U.S. Justice Department said it believes the Chinese Consulate in San Francisco is harboring a Chinese researcher, Tang Juan, who is accused of lying about her background in the Communist Party\u2019s military wing on a visa application.ADThe department announced criminal charges of visa fraud against Tang and three other Chinese researchers. It said Tang lied on a visa application last October as she made plans to work at the University of California, Davis, and again during an FBI interview months later.U.S. authorities this week announced criminal charges against two Chinese computer hackers who are accused of targeting companies that are working on vaccines for the coronavirus.U.S. officials including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo have stepped up accusations of technology theft.

Subscribe today.arrow-rightThe State Department\u2019s abrupt order shutting down the Chinese Consulate in Houston this week is a case study in Mr. Trump\u2019s counterproductivity. It will inevitably lead to the permanent closure of a comparable U.S. mission in China \u2014 probably in Wuhan, where the covid-19 epidemic originated. That will reduce channels of communication and diminish U.S.\u2009understanding of China\u2019s domestic situation, while doing next to nothing to address the offensive activities of the Xi regime, from its crackdown in Hong Kong to its attempts to spy on Americans and steal U.S. technology.U.S. officials are describing the Houston consulate as a nest of espionage activities, though they have offered no evidence to back that up. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo portrayed the closure as sending a message: \u201cWe are setting out clear expectations for how the Chinese Communist Party is going to behave, and when they don\u2019t, we\u2019re going to take actions that protect the American people, protect our security, our national security, and also protect our economy and jobs.\u201dADADThat\u2019s good campaign rhetoric \u2014 but closing consulates won\u2019t accomplish those aims. Most Chinese hacking and spying is directed from China, not Houston. Many of the other measures Mr. Trump has taken, from imposing tariffs on U.S.-China trade to restricting student visas, have damaged the U.S.\u00a0economy and cost jobs without changing Chinese behavior.Mr. Trump\u2019s crusade \u2014 including racist references to the \u201cChinese virus\u201d and \u201ckung flu\u201d  \u2014 would be more plausible if it did not represent an abrupt, election-season U-turn. Until March, Mr. Trump was publicly praising Mr. Xi as a great leader, including in his response to the coronavirus. In private, Mr.\u2009Trump reportedly begged the Chinese ruler for help with his reelection campaign while approving of Mr. Xi\u2019s crackdowns in Hong Kong and on the Uighurs of Xinjiang province. In the trade deal he struck with Mr. Xi in January, Mr. Trump gave up demands for meaningful reforms in China\u2019s trade practices in pursuit of pre-election soybean purchases from Midwestern farmers.The president has since come to see greater electoral benefit in blaming Beijing for the spread of covid-19 while portraying opponent Joe Biden as a Chinese puppet. Some of the resulting flurry of measures are worthy, if long overdue: Under heavy pressure from Congress, the administration finally imposed sanctions on officials and companies involved in the Xinjiang and Hong Kong crackdowns.ADADYet this in no way represents a cogent strategy for countering Mr. Xi\u2019s ambition to spread China\u2019s model of dictatorship around the world and forcibly silence critics at home and abroad. That would require coordination with U.S. allies \u2014 such as Germany, South Korea and Japan, which Mr. Trump instead threatens with trade wars or the withdrawal of U.S.\u00a0troops. It would mean reviving the Trans-Pacific Partnership on trade. And it would require leaving open channels for diplomacy with Beijing to address issues such as North Korea\u2019s growing nuclear arsenal and global warming. Closing consulates will achieve none of that.Read more: Max Boot: No one does more to hurt America and help China than TrumpThe Post\u2019s View: What\u2019s happening in Xinjiang is genocideThe Post\u2019s View: China gutted Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy.

A year on, the move has proved a milestone but hardly a watershed. Even with Fitch Ratings Inc. also in China now, there\u2019s a long way to go in a market where the vast majority of bonds receive stellar ratings and defaults can come out of nowhere.Support our journalism. Subscribe today.arrow-right1. Are overseas companies shaking things up?Not just yet. The world\u2019s top credit risk raters face a long journey to establish a substantial presence. While S&P received approval to grade all domestic bonds, Fitch is permitted only to rate financial institutions, their securities and structured finance bonds. Moody\u2019s Corp., which has a joint venture with a local rating firm, has applied for a domestic credit rating agency license. The application has yet to be approved, according to a person familiar with the situation. Since its entry a little over a year ago, S&P has issued just 10 ratings (half were issuer credit ratings, the rest structured finance ratings). That\u2019s a drop in the ocean compared with 2,808 onshore ratings of debt products from 1,695 issuers in the first quarter of this year alone, according to the National Association of Financial Market Institutional Investors.ADAD2. What\u2019s holding them back?To some degree, the foreign firms\u2019 high standards. The majority of Chinese borrowers are rated investment grade by domestic firms. Given the multiple reasons to want high ratings -- regulatory approval for bond sales, lower borrowing costs, debt qualifying as collateral for certain loans -- there\u2019s limited incentive for local issuers to risk getting a lower rating from an overseas firm. Other challenges include cut-throat pricing by domestic raters and, in Fitch\u2019s case, those restrictions on the scope of its business.3. What\u2019s the issue with domestic raters?They\u2019re criticized for being overly generous and failing to differentiate between different credit qualities. About 96% of onshore ratings now are AA or above, according to Peter Eastham, managing director and head of analytics for S&P\u2019s China business. In comparison, 71.8% of U.S. corporate debt was investment grade at the start of 2019, according to an S&P report. Local rating firms have also been slow to spot companies in trouble such as Wintime Energy Co. and Kangmei Pharmaceutical Co., among the latest defaults since China\u2019s first in 2014. There\u2019s been wayward behavior, too. Dagong Global Credit Rating Co. was banned from grading bonds for a year in 2018 for charging borrowers high fees for consulting services and giving regulators fake information. A growing number of Chinese investors have looked beyond raters and started doing their own research and risk analysis.ADAD4. How differently do overseas raters see things?A look at the offshore market -- Chinese bonds sold outside the country -- illustrates the gulf. Among 15 property developers with top AAA ratings in the domestic market and that also carry offshore ratings, eight had a low rating from at least one of the international firms.5. Are overseas funds buying more Chinese bonds?International investors have been steadily increasing their bets in the world\u2019s second-largest bond market in recent years, but predominantly on safer debt issued by China\u2019s government and policy banks. Foreign holdings accounted for 0.61% of onshore corporate debt at the end of May, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That\u2019s up 0.12 percentage point from the same period last year. Other concerns for overseas funds include liquidity, hedging options, the convertibility of China\u2019s currency and capital controls.ADAD6. What is in it for China?Having more robust credit ratings is a pillar of its efforts to turn the bond market into a more effective fund-raising venue where risk is better priced, so as to take pressure off an overstretched banking system. Chinese officials have sought to encourage steady inflows of global funds into the domestic market, in part to help balance pressures on the yuan after an exodus of capital in 2015. The push for foreign investors is also part of the government\u2019s drive to modernize its financial markets and increase the yuan\u2019s global usage.7. So overseas raters need patience?Correct. The dominance of local firms and a financial culture that is less risk-averse, at least for now, means acceptance of more rigorous standards will need time. A big challenge is to change the mindset of investors and issuers who are used to dealing with local raters that tend to have sub-par practices. While competition may lead to consolidation in the industry, major domestic firms are expected to maintain their dominance for the foreseeable future.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P.", "comment": "0 Comments", "topic": "Business"}, {"cover": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/VJ3BDZWLMYI6VITSA7PPRLUYUY.jpghttps://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/VJ3BDZWLMYI6VITSA7PPRLUYUY.jpg", "title": "U.S. accuses  of sponsoring criminal hackers targeting coronavirus vaccine research", "date": "Jul 21, 2020", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/us-china-covid-19-vaccine-research/2020/07/21/8b6ca0c0-cb58-11ea-91f1-28aca4d833a0_story.html", "keyword": "China and Security", "website": "the Washington Post", "author": "Ellen NakashimaDevlin Barrett", "content": "U.S. officials accused China on Tuesday of sponsoring criminal hackers who are targeting biotech firms around the world working on coronavirus vaccines and treatments, as the FBI said the Chinese government was acting like \u201can organized criminal syndicate.\u201dSupport our journalism.

The indictment says the two men recently \u201cresearched vulnerabilities in the networks of biotech and other firms publicly known for work on covid-19 vaccines, treatments, and testing technology.\u201dThe indictment does not indicate whether the alleged hacks were successful in obtaining vaccine research.ADThe indictment does not name the companies allegedly hacked by the duo, but the list includes firms in California, Maryland, Washington state, Texas, Virginia and Massachusetts.ADThis year the alleged hackers also compromised a British artificial-intelligence firm, a Spanish defense contractor and an Australian solar energy engineering company, the indictment says.U.S., Britain and Canada say Russian cyberspies are trying to steal coronavirus vaccine researchThe FBI and the Department of Homeland Security warned in May that hackers linked to the Chinese government were targeting coronavirus vaccine research. And China is not the only government eyeing such information. Last week the United States, Britain and Canada issued an unusual joint statement advising that Russian hackers also were targeting firms and university labs developing vaccines to stave off the novel coronavirus.AD\u201cChina has now taken its place, alongside Russia, Iran and North Korea, in that shameful club of nations that provide a safe haven for cybercriminals in exchange for those criminals being \u2018on call\u2019 to work for the benefit of the state, here to feed the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s insatiable hunger for American and other non-Chinese companies\u2019 hard-earned intellectual property, including covid-19 research,\u201d said John C.

He called the accused hackers \u201ca prolific threat to U.S. and foreign networks.\u201dADThe Chinese government has routinely denied it conducts or sponsors hacks of foreign networks for purposes of economic espionage.The indictment is the latest salvo by the Trump administration, which has taken an increasingly aggressive stance against Chinese economic espionage and Beijing\u2019s push to replace the United States as the global leader in the high-tech economy.ADNews of the indictment came as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was in London meeting with British Prime Minister Boris Johnson to discuss the two allies\u2019 rising tensions with China. Just last week Britain delivered a significant win to Washington by announcing it was barring the Chinese technology giant Huawei from its nascent 5G wireless networks.Britain bars Huawei from 5G networks, part of a global shift away from the Chinese tech giantThe indictment is part of the Justice Department\u2019s China initiative, launched in 2018, prioritizing countering Chinese national security threats in line with the administration\u2019s national security strategy.ADAbout 80\u2009percent of all federal economic espionage prosecutions allege conduct that would benefit the Chinese state, and there is at least some nexus to China in about 60\u00a0percent of all federal cases of trade secret theft.ADThe intrusions targeted industries outlined in \u201cMade in China 2025\u201d \u2014 China\u2019s 10-year plan to become a leader in specific advanced-technology sectors, Demers noted. The thefts in this case covered eight of the 10 sectors, he said, including next-generation information technology, robotics and automated machine tools, aircraft components, clean-energy vehicles, biotechnology and advanced rail.The indictment outlined how stealing intellectual property from companies in these industries could help Chinese companies replicate the technology and beat their Western competitors.ADIn one case, Demers noted, Li and Dong allegedly stole testing mechanisms, manufacturing processes and supply-chain data from a Maryland technology firm that would reveal what products the firm was intending to bring to market, and would save a competitor time and money on research and development.ADIn another, he noted, Li and Dong allegedly stole source code from a Massachusetts medical device engineering company as it was seeking to protect such data from a Chinese firm with which it had partnered to produce device components.Demers added that he worried that \u201ceven the attempted hacking\u201d of vaccine information \u201ccan slow down\u201d the research because \u201cif you do have a breach .\u2009.\u2009. obviously people\u2019s attention needs to be focused on remediating that breach.\u201dThe defendants had studied at the University of Electronic Science and Technology in Chengdu, authorities charged. They stole hundreds of millions of dollars\u2019 worth of trade secrets and other valuable business information, and at least once threatened to post a victim\u2019s intellectual property on the Internet unless a ransom was paid, according to the indictment.ADADTheir work benefited the MSS, authorities charged in the indictment. In one case, they allegedly gave the spy agency the email and password of a Hong Kong activist. In another, an MSS officer allegedly gave the hackers malware to help them penetrate the computer of a Myanmar human rights group.To gain access to victim networks, the two men primarily exploited publicly known software vulnerabilities in popular Web server software, the indictment stated. In some cases, those vulnerabilities were newly announced, meaning that many users would not have installed patches to correct the vulnerability.The defendants used their initial access to place malicious programs, such as the \u201cChina Chopper,\u201d and credential-stealing software on networks, which allowed them to remotely control victims\u2019 computers, the indictment stated.ADADThe first sign of the defendants\u2019 efforts was detected on computers of the Energy Department\u2019s Hanford Site in eastern Washington state, officials said.Analysts said the indictment underlines that the issue is not cybertechnology, which is a means to an end, but the government or actor approving the hacking campaign.\u201cWe don\u2019t have a cyber problem \u2014 we have a China, Russia, Iran and North Korea problem,\u201d said Dmitri Alperovitch, chairman of Silverado Policy Accelerator, a public policy think tank, and co-founder of the cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike. \u201cThat\u2019s because even when we are not dealing with nation-state activity, we are dealing with these four states that are protecting or even paying cybercriminals operating within their borders.\u201d\n\n\n\n", "comment": "615 Comments", "topic": "National Security"}, {"cover": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/GEGC2HWHUAI6VKBFQ4RAATSBKA.jpghttps://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/GEGC2HWHUAI6VKBFQ4RAATSBKA.jpg", "title": "The Technology 202: The Twitter breach was worse than it looked.

The attackers were also able to view the personal information including the email addresses and phone\u00a0numbers of all targeted accounts, and potentially more information.\u00a0Even more striking: The hackers were able to download a wide swath of information \u2013 including an archive that contains direct messages, tweets and profile information \u2013 for eight accounts. None of these were verified users, the company said.\u00a0The findings underscore that the attackers' actions went beyond simply posting similar messages directing Twitter users to send money to cryptocurrency accounts, as Rachel Lerman, Joseph Marks and I detailed last week. However, a law enforcement official told Rachel that the attack does not appear to be politically motivated and was focused on the fraud scheme.\u00a0The revelations raise new questions about the security of personal data on Twitter.\u00a0The highly sensitive information the hackers had access to could be leveraged in far more sinister ways. If the attackers obtained direct messages, for instance, they could leak them to embarrass public figures or create chaos during a major event, or say, the presidential election.\u00a0ADADEven though the hackers were not able to obtain the direct messages of the public figures \u2013 who all have verified accounts \u2013 using the tool Twitter identified, they may have obtained them using other means during the heist. Twitter says its investigation remains ongoing, and it declined to comment beyond the blog post.\u00a0Another risk: Details such as phone numbers and email addresses for powerful individuals \u2013 such as former president Barack Obama or Washington Post owner and Amazon chief executive Jeff Bezos who were also targeted \u2013 could be leveraged to conduct other online scams.\u00a0The incident could increase pressure for Twitter to encrypt direct messages.\u00a0Sen. Ron Wyden is calling on Twitter to adopt tougher security measures to ensure the messaging feature isn't abused by hackers or employees. The Oregon Democrat said that Twitter chief executive Jack Dorsey told him during a 2018 meeting that Twitter was working on end-to-end encrypted direct messages, but that feature has never materialized.ADAD\u201cWhile it still isn't clear if the hackers behind [Wednesday's] incident gained access to Twitter direct messages, this is a vulnerability that has lasted for far too long, and one that is not present in other, competing platforms,\u201d Wyden said in a statement. \u201cIf hackers gained access to users' DMs, this breach could have a breathtaking impact, for years to come.\u201dThe social network\u2019s rocky record on data security is under new scrutiny.\u00a0Dorsey\u2019s own Twitter account was hacked less than a year ago. Other prominent brands have fallen victim to attacks, including many National Football League organizations earlier this year. And there has already been scrutiny of the broad access Twitter employees have to accounts, sparked by an incident several years ago when a departing employee deleted President Trump\u2019s account.\u00a0ADADNow the FBI will lead a federal inquiry into the hack, and Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo (D) directed New York state to start its own probe, as Rachel reported.\u00a0Washington lawmakers \u2014 including Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) and Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) \u2014 have also pressed Twitter for more details about the incident.\u00a0Twitter remains under an order with the Federal Trade Commission, due to previous privacy lapses. The FTC has declined to comment on the incident, but former agency officials say the recent hack could be grounds for it to open a fresh probe into Twitter.\u00a0Twitter has promised to be transparent about its investigation, and it said it was further securing its systems to prevent future attacks. It\u2019s also increasing security training for its employees, as the company\u2019s initial findings suggest some of its employees fell victim to a social engineering attack.\u00a0ADAD\u201cWe\u2019re embarrassed, we\u2019re disappointed, and more than anything, we\u2019re sorry,\u201d the company wrote in the blog post. \u00a0Early reports suggest a group of young people carried out the attack.\u00a0A new report from the New York Times indicates that the hack was the work of a group of young people, including one who still lives at home with his mom. The Times interviewed four people who participated in the breach, who said they got to know each other because of their interest in early or unusual screen names, especially with one character, such as @6.\u00a0A user named \u201cKirk\u201d claimed to work at Twitter and had access to powerful insider tools that allowed him to take control of almost any Twitter account. However other hackers involved in the incident do not believe Kirk actually worked for the company because of how much damage he was willing to inflict. Kirk's identity and motivation remain a mystery to even the people who worked with him.\u00a0Our top tabsThe Trump campaign is attacking TikTok for allegedly spying on users in new ads.The campaign has posted more than 100 versions of Facebook ads accusing the Chinese company of monitoring data copied by users' phones, Donie O'Sullivan at CNN reports.ADADThe ads directed Facebook users to sign a petition banning TikTok. From The New York Times's Taylor Lorenz:Facebook removed one of the ads with a checkbox graphic for violating its policy against graphics with nonexistent features.\u00a0\"We get that election rhetoric gets heated, which is why we don't accept political ads on our platform. What's more interesting is that Facebook is taking money for a political ad that attacks a competitor just as it's preparing to launch a TikTok copycat,\" a TikTok representative told CNN.TikTok's access to users' clipboards, which store copied data such as passwords, sparked security concerns last month. TikTok said it used the access to prevent spammy behavior but\u00a0discontinued the feature shortly after the backlash.ADThe White House's threat to ban the app, which is owned by China's ByteDance, is the latest step in Trump's push against the alleged security threats of Chinese technology. Trump has accused TikTok of sharing user data with the Chinese government. TikTok has repeatedly said the Chinese government has not asked it for data, and it would not comply if it did.\u00a0ADThe administration has also gone after other Chinese tech companies for alleged spying, including telecommunications firm Huawei. TikTok recently put on hold plans to build a headquarters in London following a similar clash between the United Kingdom and Huawei, the Guardian reports.This isn't the first time Trump has run ads against social media platforms. His campaign\u00a0ran an ad earlier this month slamming Snap and Twitter for allegedly censoring conservative voices.Disney is the latest company to slash advertising on Facebook.The company is one of Facebook's biggest clients, underscoring the rising tensions between the social network and advertisers over its handling of harmful or hateful content. Disney expressed concerns with Facebook's enforcement of policies for hate speech and other incendiary content, Suzanne Vranica at the Wall Street Journal reports.\u00a0ADADDisney spent $210 million on ads for its Disney Plus streaming in the first half of the year, making it Facebook's biggest advertising client. Last year it was Facebook's second-biggest advertising client.Disney also paused spending on Instagram for streaming service Hulu and is reevaluating spending in other divisions, Suzanne reports.Disney did not publicize the cuts or express participation in the ongoing organized boycott against Facebook by advertisers.\u00a0Facebook met with organizers of the boycott, known as the #StopHateForProfit campaign, earlier this month to discuss their concerns.\u00a0Increased reliance on foreign students has put tech companies at odds with the Trump administration.The number of foreign students hired by tech companies is nearly six times greater than a decade ago, Kira Tebbe reports for OneZero.\u00a0ADADThe top five tech companies were granted more than 30 percent of the 85,000 visas allotted for skilled foreign workers last year. For some companies, the ability to hire foreign workers has been key to rapid growth: The number of workers hired under the H1-B visa at Amazon grew from 523 in 2010 to 8,585 last year.But Trump's attacks on foreign workers have put that growth at risk. Last month major tech companies and industry groups blasted Trump's order to block H-1B visas until the end of the year. They argued that shutting out foreign talent would hurt U.S. innovation.Last week, 19 tech companies and industry groups including Google, Facebook and Microsoft signed an amicus brief in support of a lawsuit by Harvard and MIT to halt a policy that would have barred international students from staying in the United States if their universities didn't host physical classes. The administration reversed the policy, settling the lawsuit.Rant and raveA picture of Mark Zuckerberg surfing with a lot of sunscreen took Twitter by storm yesterday.Some users defended his skin protection:And he appeared to be using sunscreen that was safe for the coral reef.

Britain announced Monday it would end an extradition treaty with Hong Kong and extend an arms embargo to the territory, and last week reversed its position toward the Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei.Pompeo\u2019s January visit was far chillier. The top U.S. diplomat effectively accused the British government of jeopardizing a long-standing intelligence agreement by allowing Huawei, seen as close to the Chinese state, to be a part of Britain\u2019s 5G network.ADADBut much has changed in half a year. Britain, like the United States, has been one of the countries hit hardest by the coronavirus pandemic that began in China. It finds itself increasingly at odds with Beijing on several fronts, including not only Huawei and the new national security law that tightens Beijing\u2019s grip on Hong Kong but also growing public outrage about human rights violations.British leaders were a receptive audience for the secretary of state, who chastises the Chinese Communist Party almost daily and plans to give a speech Friday on \u201cCommunist China and the future of the free world.\u201dPompeo met privately with Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab and spoke to hawkish members of the governing Conservative Party at a roundtable hosted by the Henry Jackson Society, a London-based think tank that is critical of China.ADADHe was scheduled later to meet with Chris Patten, the last British governor of Hong Kong, and Nathan Law, a pro-democracy politician from Hong Kong.Pompeo and Raab spoke to reporters at Lancaster House, a dazzling neoclassical mansion in London\u2019s West End. When Raab was asked if the United States had pressured Britain to reject Huawei, Pompeo responded.\u201cI think the United Kingdom made a good decision,\u201d the secretary of state said. \u201cBut I think that decision was made not because the United States said that it was a good decision.\u201dRaab said he didn\u2019t \u201cthink there is any question of strong-arming.\u201d He and Pompeo \u201calways have constructive conversations,\u201d he said.Johnson, whose government hopes to secure a trade deal with the United States that could shape its post-European Union economic future, told reporters Monday that he did not want to be \u201ca knee-jerk Sinophobe on every issue, somebody who is automatically anti-China.\u201dADADBut the British leader also said there were real concerns about China, and his government had to respond. Britain announced the suspension of the extradition treaty and the extensions of the arms embargo Monday. The week before, Britain announced it would suspend new deployments of Huawei equipment to its high-speed 5G network, in line with long-standing U.S. requests that allies isolate the Chinese company.China has repeatedly reprimanded Britain for its actions. In a statement Tuesday, an unnamed spokesman for the Chinese Embassy in London warned Britain \u201cwill bear the consequences if it insists on going down the wrong road.\u201d\u201cChina has never interfered in UK\u2019s internal affairs,\u201d Liu Xiaoming, the Chinese ambassador to Britain, wrote on Twitter. \u201cThe UK should do the same to China. Otherwise it must bear the consequences.\u201dADADBut the moves enjoyed broad support among British politicians. Conservative Party lawmaker Tobias Ellwood, who met with Pompeo on Tuesday, told the House of Commons on Monday that Britain needed a \u201cstrategic overhaul of our foreign policy in relation to China.\u201dKeir Starmer, the leader of Britain\u2019s opposition Labour Party, who also met with Pompeo, said Britain needed to go further and impose sanctions on Chinese officials suspected of human rights abuses.At the Henry Jackson Society, Pompeo described success against China as a long game that would stretch beyond the Trump administration, according to a person in the room. That outlook is necessary, the person said, because China\u2019s President Xi Jinping sees China\u2019s rise as a multigenerational effort.

Subscribe today.arrow-rightThe Rabbit Chairman argues that the United States lost the war in Vietnam because many Americans mistakenly thought the North Vietnamese were old-fashioned communists. In fact, after they took power and were responsible for governing the country, they became nationalists.ADADU.S. officials are now attacking the Chinese Communist Party \u2014 and reportedly weighing a sweeping travel ban against members \u2014 without realizing its complexity and diversity. It is no longer the party that exemplifies the communist goals of Stalin or Mao. After Deng Xiaoping came to power in 1978, the party was transformed into an organization to represent the nation. The Party includes people who have been pro-American, including business people, scientists and intellectuals. But when Americans attack the Communist Party as a whole, members \u2014 particularly those who would like to see more democratic procedures \u2014 rally to support the Party and, by extension, the nation.In the half century since I became a professor of East Asian studies at Harvard, I have had the pleasure of teaching many Chinese students, some of whom stayed in the United States and others who returned to China. I have also come to know many Chinese students and faculty who studied at Harvard but were not my students. I have visited China at least once a year over the past four decades and have often met those students and scholars who returned home to China.Many were excellent students in the United States. They were open to new ideas and enjoyed the intellectual freedom. In the past several years, as U.S.-China relations have become more polarized, returnees have faced new constraints on their freedom in China. Many find creative ways to stretch their freedom while staying out of trouble. They want to be loyal to China while remaining friends of the United States. But when they read of Americans attacking China with accusations that are not true \u2014 such as saying that the coronavirus was purposely engineered in a Wuhan laboratory \u2014 this strengthens their patriotism and willingness to support the Chinese government against Washington.ADADMany returnees have advanced important policies, such as establishing rules that required payments to American firms for intellectual property or standards applied by institutions such as the United Nations. Former premier Zhu Rongji fought to gain membership in the World Trade Organization so that China would be forced to make internal changes that meshed with those of international organizations. China chose as the head of its new Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) someone who had served in both the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank and who wanted to make the AIIB one that followed world standards. The lawyer he hired to write the rules for the AIIB was an American woman, a graduate of Harvard and Harvard Law School. However, not only did American government officials refuse to join the AIIB, but they also urged our allies to do the same. Many Chinese concluded that the United States was not concerned with principles but only with retaining international power.Our Americans sent to China by the Fulbright program have done a marvelous job of establishing academic relationships and making important connections. Now the United States has said that it would be suspended. Americans who took part in the program and Chinese friends who responded positively now feel abandoned by the country that once sought their friendship.How would we feel if we were in the position of those tens of thousands of Chinese who had returned home and worked hard to prepare China for better adherence to international rules and who then read that prominent Americans claim that engagement had failed? I can tell you that many who had fought to respond to American requests and felt proud of their successes in adopting international standards \u2014 often against domestic resistance \u2014 feel as if their valiant efforts and successes are seen by prominent Americans as worthless. Many are members of the Communist Party. Americans ignorant of their sacrifices for international rules are pushing them toward anti-American nationalism.ADADIn recent years, U.S. policy and political rhetoric toward China have been dominated by officials with limited knowledge of developments in that country. It is not in the United States\u2019 interest to turn the Chinese into enemies. If we want to encourage them to work with us for our common interests, we need some fundamental rethinking of our policies. This in turn requires that high officials be willing to support our friends in China and learn more about its internal dynamics.Read more:Josh Rogin: Trump\u2019s China hawks are loose and not wasting any timeJohn Pomfret: The Trump administration\u2019s China policies are ironically bolstering BeijingMitt Romney: America is awakening to China.

A new trading venue launched last year in Shanghai is making it easier for them to access funding at home. The Nasdaq-style SSE STAR Market has relatively relaxed rules on listing and trading that have drawn the attention of big names including Jack Ma\u2019s Ant Group and Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. The result has been at times wild, demonstrating why authorities were so keen to build a testing ground before unleashing new rules on other exchanges.Support our journalism. Subscribe today.arrow-right1. What\u2019s the STAR Market?It\u2019s \u201cwhere the rising star companies cluster,\u201d according to its website. Part of the Shanghai Stock Exchange, it has a simplified system under which tech companies and startups face less red tape in getting the nod to sell shares. The changes are aimed at lowering the wait time for approval to three months, compared to perhaps years on China\u2019s other stock venues. The new board also removes limits on the pricing of initial public offerings and eliminates caps on first-day trading gains.ADAD2. What\u2019s the rationale?Market observers have been interpreting it as a gift to Shanghai from President Xi Jinping, who announced the plan in 2018, in line with his broader goal of boosting the city\u2019s status as a global financial center. It\u2019s also seen as an effort to stem the exodus of tech listings from the mainland especially as Hong Kong\u2019s bourse opens its doors wider to such companies and the sort of dual-class listings many of them prefer. It provides another way for the government to get investors on board with Xi\u2019s goal of championing Chinese leadership in the tech sector, and it may help insulate Chinese firms if a U.S. bill that would make it harder for some to list in New York becomes law.3. What\u2019s been the response?ADTrading started with 25 companies on July 22, 2019, and was so frenzied that stock prices rose by an average of 140% that day. A year later, more than 130 firms were listed with a combined market capitalization of 2.5 trillion yuan ($356 billion), mostly small- and mid-size companies. IPOs generally continue to do well; SMIC surged more than 200% during its debut in mid-July.AD4. Why so robust?The high valuations could be due to the herding behavior of Chinese retail (individual) investors, who tend to rush toward the next big theme, as well as to so-called unicorns for their relative scarcity. Most STAR board listings are in red-hot sectors including semiconductors and health care. It also shows what happens when IPOs have no caps on valuations and new stocks have no limits on price moves for the first five days. Meanwhile, a rising tide lifts all boats as central bank-fueled liquidity drove a broad market rally, with many retail investors diverting bank savings and fixed-income investments into equities.AD5. So how\u2019s the pipeline?Days after SMIC debuted, Ant Group, the parent of China\u2019s largest mobile payment company, announced plans to list simultaneously in Hong Kong and the STAR board. The company could seek a valuation of at least $200 billion. Geely Automobile Holdings Ltd. and Covid-19 vaccine maker CanSino Biologics Inc. also plan STAR listings. Some analysts think the huge number of tech startups in China will help keep demand for the new board strong. The Haidian district of Beijing has 148,600 tech firms and will have revenue of more than 2 trillion yuan ($281 billion) by 2020, according to Minsheng Securities Co.AD6. How had tech stocks been traded?ADMainly on the ChiNext in Shenzhen and the National Equities Exchange and Quotations, or NEEQ, in Beijing. The former has more than 760 members, most of them small technology firms with a track record of profitability at the time of listing. A good example of a ChiNext stock is Contemporary Amperex Technology Co., a major supplier of batteries to electric car manufacturers. The NEEQ sets its bar for listing much lower than the ChiNext does, with no requirement for profitability, for example. It is China\u2019s biggest over-the-counter market with more than 9,000 companies, but trading turnover is tiny. Retail investors must have at least 5 million yuan of securities assets to participate.7. And on the new exchange?Investors need less upfront, 500,000 yuan, and two years of trading experience to participate. To reap the benefits of a less rigorous IPO system without encouraging financial fraud, regulators asked sponsoring brokerages to invest in the companies and lock in their capital for a fixed period of time. While unprofitable firms are allowed to list, they must meet minimum requirements for market value, revenue, research and development or cash flow. Vice Premier Liu He has said the new venue should be an impetus for reform in China\u2019s capital markets.ADAD8. Why now?Rising share prices in China could boost consumer spending, which has been squeezed anew by the coronavirus pandemic, as well as make it easier for companies to raise funds and pay off debt. China is also reducing its reliance on the U.S. capital market for fund-raising amid tension between the two countries. The relaxed rules will soon be rolled out more widely, including to the ChiNext board, again testing the government\u2019s ability to manage the market. The nation has seen two of the world\u2019s biggest equity bubbles in the past 13 years.9. What happened to the last big thing, CDRs?Not much. A trial program in 2018 sought to lure Big Tech firms back with so-called Chinese depositary receipts, or CDRs, which would allow domestic investors to hold overseas-listed Chinese shares. But initial expressions of interest from the likes of Alibaba, JD.com and Xiaomi haven\u2019t translated into action. In April 2019, the government announced a waiver on some taxes for investors in CDRs to encourage participation.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P.", "comment": "0 Comments", "topic": "Business"}, {"cover": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/R6IFFXGKBYI6VITSA7PPRLUYUY.jpghttps://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/R6IFFXGKBYI6VITSA7PPRLUYUY.jpg", "title": "The Cybersecurity 202: Russia and  vaccine hacks don't violate rules of road for cyberspace,", "date": "Jul 20, 2020", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/07/20/cybersecurity-202-russia-china-vaccine-hacks-dont-violate-rules-road-cyberspace-experts-say/", "keyword": "China and Security", "website": "the Washington Post", "author": "Joseph Marks", "content": "with Tonya RileyLawmakers are pushing for stiff consequences against Russia and China for hacking Western research into coronavirus vaccines \u2013 calling it a \u201clife or death\u201d issue.\u00a0Support our journalism.

And some cybersecurity experts worry the push could undermine the effort to instill those global norms.\u00a0\u201cThere are a lot of things the Russian and Chinese intelligence services are doing that we should be absolutely outraged about. This is pretty low on my list of concerns,\u201d Dmitri Alperovitch, former chief technology officer at the cybersecurity company CrowdStrike, told me. Alperovich is now chairman at the Silverado Policy Accelerator, a nonprofit think tank.ADADOn the other hand, experts fear that the new hacking authorities President Trump granted the Central Intelligence Agency could be a slippery slope that ends up undermining the push to define acceptable and unacceptable behavior for nations online. The kind of broad authorization described in the Yahoo News report, they worry, could open the door to hacks that affect foreign elections or disrupt energy service or financial transactions\u00a0\u2014 just the sort of hacking the United States has traditionally condemned.\u00a0\u201cWhat it\u2019s really signaling is the long-standing U.S. policy on attempting to advocate for the establishment of international cyber norms\u2026 that\u2019s gone,\u201d Susan Hennessey, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and former NSA lawyer, said on the think tank's\u00a0Rational Security podcast. \u201cNow, instead, we have a U.S. policy\u2026that\u2019s about\u2026being authorized to do all the things we have been screaming about China and Iran and other countries doing for years.\u201d\u00a0The developments each underscore the difficulty of creating and abiding by hard-and-fast rules as cyberspace constantly changes. That has been particularly challenging during the Trump administration, when the White House has primarily focused on projecting strength in cyberspace and pledging to punch back against adversaries rather than working with allies on creating norms for good behavior.\u00a0Several top GOP lawmakers are taking their concerns about Chinese vaccine hacking straight to the president.\u00a0They\u2019re calling on Trump to sanction Chinese government hackers for stealing that research and other data in a letter this morning, saying it \u201cputs the very lives of our citizens at risk.\u201d The letter was signed by Reps. Michael McCaul (Texas), leading Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee; Greg Walden (Ore.), leading Republican on the Energy and Commerce Committee and Patrick McHenry (N.C.), leading Republican on the Financial Services Committee.\u00a0ADADHouse Intelligence Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) similarly called the Russian efforts a \u201clife and death\u201d issue and promised a rigorous congressional investigation. That statement came just hours after the efforts were revealed in a joint alert by officials in the United States, the United Kingdom and Canada. Russia has denied the claims.\u00a0Experts, meanwhile, are savaging Trump for the CIA move, saying it could erode years of efforts to impose rules in cyberspace.\u00a0Chris Finan, cybersecurity director on the National Security Council during the Obama administration who\u2019s now CEO of Manifold Technology:The 2018 authorization basically gave the CIA broad powers to conduct convert actions in cyberspace without first getting a go-ahead from the White House and specifically mentions Russia, China, Iran and North Korea as possible targets, Yahoo reports. Since it was approved, the agency has launched dozens of secret hacking operations, the article says.\u00a0The reactions reveal just how murky the rules can be in the shadowy world of cyberspace.\u00a0In the case of the vaccine hacks, there has been no evidence so far that China or Russia wants to do anything other than to steal information that will help their own scientists work faster on combating the novel coronavirus. Experts say that focus on promoting public health makes this kind of hacking far different from the economic espionage U.S. officials have traditionally pilloried China for and which centers on raiding American companies' intellectual property to benefit Chines companies\u2019 bottom lines.ADADBut that could change down the road. For instance, China might use the stolen information to help its companies get a leg up on U.S. competitors in the market for coronavirus treatments. Even worse, hackers could use the access they gained to U.S. research labs\u2019 computer networks to sabotage future work.\u201cThe biggest concern is doing something in a way that disrupts or a slows down a potential cure,\u201d said Chris Painter, who was the State Department\u2019s top cybersecurity diplomat during the Obama administration. \u201cIf they do things that are impeding the manufacture or research of a vaccine in any way, that would clearly cross a line.\u201dIn the case of the new CIA authorities, part of what the agency is reportedly doing is hacking and releasing information that might be embarrassing to U.S. opponents. The Yahoo article points to a handful of recent data leaks that might be connected to the CIA including information about an ostensibly independent Russian company that was working with Moscow's intelligence services and about the personal information of Iranian intelligence officers.\u00a0ADADThose operations could raise problems if they seemed aimed at affecting an election and could undermine U.S. efforts to insist that such hacks should be off the table. \u00a0\u201cI happen to think the Russians actually need some payback in the hacking and dumping department, but it should stay the heck away from anything that looks like an electoral intervention,\u201d Brookings Senior Fellow Benjamin Wittes said during the Rational Security podcast. \u201cYou want to be super cautious about anything that could look like an intervention into a foreign election because that is a norm that we want to strongly support.\u201d\u00a0Diplomatic efforts to impose global cyber rules have slowed since a burst of diplomatic activity between 2013 and 2017.\u00a0Since then officials have largely focused on the harder task of imposing consequences on nations that flout those rules.ADADThe Trump administration has also pivoted to focusing more on project strength in cyberspace. That's included retaliatory cyberstrikes against Russia during the 2018 midterm elections and against Iran for shooting down a U.S. surveillance drone. But they haven\u2019t prompted either nation to significantly reduce cyberattacks against the United States.\u201cWe have countries signing onto these norms\u2026but we haven\u2019t done a very good job at imposing consequences when those norms get violated,\u201d Painter told me. \u201cWe\u2019ve become a little better at trying to disrupt them. But we still don\u2019t see quick actions that change the calculus of people violating the norms. And if they get a benefit from violating them then they\u2019ll keep doing it.\u201d\u00a0The keysEarly evidence suggests a massive Twitter hack was not politically motivated.That attack compromised the accounts of former vice president Joe Biden, former president Barack Obama and a slew of business leaders but the hackers don\u2019t appear to have had a political ax to grind, a law enforcement official told Rachel Lerman. The FBI is leading a federal investigation into the hack.ADAD\u201cThis was not a hack of Biden\u2019s campaign,\u201d the official said. \u201cOr of Elon Musk. This was all about a fraud scheme and not about trying to turn the political winds in a certain direction.\u201dFour hackers identified as involved in the scam\u00a0told The New York Times their main goal was profiting off the accounts by using them in a bitcoin scam.\u00a0Twitter confirmed in a blog post that the attackers targeted 130 accounts and downloaded the data of eight accounts. None of the eight accounts were verified, meaning that hackers did not steal the data of high-profile targets including Biden, Twitter said. The company pinned the attack\u00a0on hackers who conned employees into giving up credentials that provided access to Twitter's internal systems.ADHackers were also able to view personal information including email addresses and phone numbers for the 130 accounts targeted. For the 45 accounts they took over, that could have included \"additional information,\" though Twitter didn't give specifics.ADTrump, citing mail-in voting, declined to say that he will accept the election results.The president claimed without evidence in a Fox News interview that mail-in voting could \u201crig\u201d the November results,\u00a0Felicia Sonmez reports.

Biden has received intelligence briefings that both Russia and China are actively engaged in trying to sow doubt about the election results,\u00a0Matt Viser reports.\u00a0Those foreign interference efforts, so far, fall far short of the interference operation Russia conducted in 2016, Chris Krebs, the top cybersecurity official at the Department of Homeland Security,\u00a0said Friday.\u201cCompared to where things were in 2016, we are not seeing that level of coordinated, determined cyber activity from adversaries,\u201d Krebs said during a virtual event hosted by the Brookings Institution. \u201cWe absolutely have better visibility across the networks, and we are just not seeing that same level of activity that we saw in 2016.\u201dThe Trump campaign is attacking TikTok and accusing it of spying on users.The campaign has posted more than 100 versions of Facebook ads accusing the Chinese company of monitoring data copied by users' phones, Donie O'Sullivan at CNN reports.The New York Times's Taylor Lorenz first spotted the ads, which all directed Facebook users to sign a petition banning TikTok.TikTok's access to users' clipboards, which store copied data such as passwords, sparked security concerns last month. TikTok said it used the access to prevent spammy behavior but\u00a0discontinued the feature shortly after the backlash.The White House's\u00a0call to ban the app, which is owned by China's ByteDance, is the latest step in\u00a0Trump's push against the alleged security threats of Chinese technology. Trump has accused TikTok of sharing user data with the Chinese government. TikTok has repeatedly denied the accusation.The administration has also gone after other Chinese tech companies for alleged spying, including telecommunications firm Huawei. TikTok recently put on hold plans to build a headquarters in London following a similar clash between the United Kingdom and Huawei,\u00a0the Guardian reports.Industry reportA federal judge greenlit Facebook's lawsuit against Israeli spyware company NSO Group.Facebook filed the suit last year after accusing NSO of helping its government clients hack into the phones of \u00a0about 1,400 WhatsApp users, including political and human rights activists.

Subscribe today.arrow-rightThe Chinese military has held a growing number of exercises that simulate an invasion of Taiwan, a self-ruled island about 80 miles off China\u2019s east coast that considers the United States its main military and diplomatic backer. The pace and scale of China\u2019s drills, as well as those of U.S. naval and air forces deployed to the region, have risen in recent months as relations between Beijing and Washington plummet on numerous fronts.Relations took another sharp turn Wednesday after the State Department said it ordered China to close its consulate in Houston.ADADDefense Secretary Mark T. Esper said this week the United States would sell more arms to Taiwan as part of a $10\u2009billion deal approved by Congress. He also said the U.S. military would reposition forces across Asia to prepare for a confrontation with China in flash points including self-ruled Taiwan, which China claims as its territory and has vowed for decades to take by force if necessary. Inside China, the government has faced growing calls from hawkish military pundits and nationalist commentators to grasp the current strategic window to seize Taiwan, an accomplishment that could rally the Chinese population and burnish leader Xi Jinping\u2019s political legacy.Taiwanese Foreign Minister Joseph Wu said Wednesday he was worried China has conducted an \u201cunprecedented\u201d number of sea and air drills around Taiwan in 2020, with the pace rising to nearly once every day since June. \u201cThe threat is on the rise,\u201d he said.Wu speculated that tensions in the Taiwan Strait \u2014 one of the most heavily militarized regions in the world \u2014 could continue to deteriorate as China grapples with a steep economic slowdown, the lingering fallout from covid-19 and devastating flooding across the Chinese heartland.ADADIn recent months, Wu said, China has tangled in quick succession with neighbors in the South China Sea, with India over border territory and with Western countries over Hong Kong, where the Chinese government passed a national security law that effectively cemented Communist Party control over the city\u2019s police and courts.\u201cA country will often use an exterior crisis to change the domestic focus,\u201d Wu told reporters Wednesday. \u201cIf we look at the contested issues around China\u2019s periphery, we see that for China, Taiwan would be an extremely convenient sacrificial lamb.\u201dAt the same time, Wu said, Taiwan should not provoke China through moves such as overly publicizing its support for Hong Kong protesters. \u201cWe need to be extremely cautious,\u201d he said. \u201cOther than having full military preparedness, we need to also be very careful to avoid letting Taiwan become an excuse for China to declare war or engage militarily.\u201dADADAlthough most analysts see a full-blown war between China and the United States as unlikely, Wu\u2019s comments added to the sense of unease in Asia, where a number of countries, most recently India, have complained about China\u2019s regional assertiveness and warned about the possibility of serious military clashes. A group of former senior Taiwanese officials said in a report this week that while they did not believe Beijing was edging toward an all-out invasion, Chinese forces could launch an operation to seize one of Taiwan\u2019s outlying islands.China, for its part, has accused the United States of stoking tensions by ramping up military activity in China\u2019s strategic backyard and building a coalition of countries in a Cold War-style effort to contain its rise. The U.S. Navy this month deployed two aircraft carriers to the South China Sea, days before Secretary of State Mike Pompeo declared China\u2019s claims in the sea \u2014 which cover about 90\u2009percent of the strategic waterway \u2014 to be \u201cunlawful.\u201dBeijing has also lashed out angrily at Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen, whom it accused of refusing to acknowledge a 1992 diplomatic formulation that accepted Taiwan and the Chinese mainland as part of \u201cone China.\u201dADADIn a major speech in January 2019, Xi offered an ultimatum to Taiwan to come to the table for unification talks or face annexation by force. But as a precondition for talks, China demanded that Tsai acknowledge the \u201cone China\u201d principle.Wu on Wednesday dismissed the likelihood of the Taiwanese administration entering a negotiation, saying it was \u201cabsolutely not going to go anywhere.\u201d\u201cIf China demands that Taiwan accept the precondition that Taiwan is part of China, then what\u2019s the point of negotiation if the conclusion is already reached?\u201d he said. \u201cTo talk about the prospects of dialogue I think is just hypothetical.\u201d\n\nChina vows to retaliate after U.S. orders closure of its consulate in Houston\nU.S. accuses China of sponsoring criminal hackers targeting coronavirus research\nAustralia suspends Hong Kong extradition treaty, invites migrants from city\n", "comment": "0 Comments", "topic": "Asia & Pacific"}, {"cover": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/2ELHBBJD6FDJTD23BWS4UZFG4A.jpghttps://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/2ELHBBJD6FDJTD23BWS4UZFG4A.jpg", "title": "Mark Cuban, Ted Cruz spar over BLM, coronavirus and ", "date": "Jul 21, 2020", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2020/07/21/mark-cuban-ted-cruz-spar-over-blm-coronavirus-china/", "keyword": "China and Security", "website": "the Washington Post", "author": "Des Bieler", "content": "Two of Texas\u2019s most prominent figures sparred Monday over Twitter, jabbing at each other over topics including protests during the national anthem, the Black Lives Matter movement, the novel coronavirus pandemic and the NBA\u2019s relationship with China.Support our journalism. Subscribe today.arrow-rightBy the end \u2014 at least for the time being \u2014 Texas Sen. Ted Cruz (R) was reiterating his assertion that Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban was loath to criticize China while declining to answer Cuban\u2019s question about why the senator seems reticent to criticize President Trump.The issue of the NBA and China first created a politically charged discussion in October after Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey posted, then deleted, a tweet that supported protesters in Hong Kong. Los Angeles Lakers star LeBron James, who criticized Morey after returning from a league-sponsored trip to China, garnered accusations of hypocrisy at the time for having outspoken views on social injustice in the United States while appearing to downplay human rights abuses in the NBA\u2019s most important foreign market.ADADMore recently, ESPN\u2019s top NBA reporter, Adrian Wojnarowski, was suspended after emailing a profanity to Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) after the latter criticized the league for allowing messages promoting issues of social justice, including BLM, on its jerseys this summer but not allowing messages supportive of law enforcement or critical of China\u2019s Communist Party.Cruz\u2019s back-and-forth with Cuban began after the Mavericks owner sent a dismissive tweet Sunday evening to a Dallas-area radio host who said he would be \u201cOUT\u201d on the team\u2019s return to play unless Cuban helped avert player protests during the national anthem. Cuban followed that up with another tweet in which he claimed the \u201cNational Anthem Police in this country are out of control.\u201dCruz then shared an image of Cuban\u2019s first tweet while telling his followers, \u201cReally??!? NBA is telling everyone who stands for the flag, who honors our cops and our veterans, to \u2018piss off\u2019? In Texas, no less? Good luck with that.\u201dCruz also took issue with Cuban\u2019s second tweet, but the fact that he used an image in his initial criticism rather than retweeting, tagging or replying directly to Cuban earned the scorn of the Mavericks owner.ADAD\u201cHave some balls for once,\u201d Cuban tweeted Monday morning, tagging Cruz\u2019s handle. \u201cSpeak to me. It\u2019s my tweet.\u201dCruz responded by sarcastically declaring that tweeting out his disbelief over Cuban\u2019s anthem stance \u201cto the world\u201d was indeed \u201cmeant somehow to keep it a secret,\u201d because Cuban is \u201cvery scary.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m a Rockets fan, but more than happy to cheer on the Mavericks (great team this year),\u201d Cruz tweeted at Cuban. \u201cIt\u2019s sad to see you telling so many Texans to \u2018piss off.\u2019 \u201dIt is unclear why Cruz twice suggested that Cuban had actually used the phrase \u201cpiss off\u201d when that was not the case, at least not in the tweets Cuban sent Sunday evening.Cuban, who said in 2017 that he was \u201cconsidering\u201d a run for president, was sharply critical of Cruz the year before when Cruz was still among a field of hopefuls for the Republican Party nomination.ADAD\u201cI think he is Joe McCarthy reincarnate,\u201d Cuban said then of Cruz. Calling Cruz an \u201cobstructionist,\u201d Cuban added, \u201cI just keep on waiting for him to say something to the effect [of], \u2018Are you or have you ever been a member of some party?\u2019 \u201dOn Monday, Cruz parroted Cuban\u2019s testicular verbiage while tweeting that he would \u201cwait\u201d for his sparring partner to \u201ctell us what you think about China.\u201dWhen an hour went by with no response, Cruz asked if Cuban would say \u201cFree Hong Kong\u201d or allow his players to put that on their jerseys. He also challenged Cuban to condemn what he described as the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s detention of Uighurs in \u201cconcentration camps\u201d and taunted Cuban as having nothing to say on China except praise for \u201cChairman Mao.\"ADApproximately an hour after that, Cuban replied by tweeting: \u201cI can say Black Lives Matter. I can say there is systemic racism in this country. I can say there is a Pandemic that you have done little to end.\u201dADCuban also pointed to a 2019 video that showed him suggesting ways he might use American stock exchanges to create \u201cleverage\u201d against China, as opposed to Trump\u2019s Twitter-oriented efforts to ramp up a trade war. In addition, Cuban cited a 2017 documentary he co-produced, \u201cThe China Hustle,\u201d that focuses on alleged securities fraud involving Chinese companies and U.S. investment firms.Cuban then asked Cruz why the latter takes \u201csuch pride in standing up to and speaking truth to the Chinese\u201d but has \u201cno ability to stand up to and speak the truth to [Trump].\u201dAs some observers of the exchange noted, Trump was accused in a book last month by former national security adviser John Bolton of not only failing to condemn Chinese President Xi Jinping for the detention camps but of actively encouraging his counterpart to continue what Trump saw as, in the words of Bolton, \u201cexactly the right thing to do.\u201dADADWith Bolton\u2019s claims making headlines, Trump signed a measure, the Uighur Human Rights Policy Act, that reportedly drew an unhappy response from Beijing. Cruz, along with three other U.S. officials, including Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), was sanctioned by China last week for his condemnation of human rights abuses in the Xin\u00adjiang region, where Uighurs make up the largest ethnic group.Cruz ignored the question about his treatment of Trump but did address some of Cuban\u2019s other assertions, tweeting: \u201cI agree Black Lives Matter. I agree there is a pandemic & we have taken extraordinary steps to defeat it.\u201d\u201cWhere did that pandemic originate?\u201d Cruz continued. \u201cWhy did Communist China COVER UP the Wuhan outbreak & arrest whistle-blowers? And why are you terrified to say ONE WORD about China?\u201dADADAt that point, it apparently was Cuban\u2019s turn to ignore a pointed question. He did, however, take note of chatter online among some conservative voices urging their followers to boycott Cuban\u2019s companies, which include investments he has made via the hit TV show \u201cShark Tank.\u201dCuban leaned into the effort to punish him financially by tweeting a link to his personal website, where he said boycott-minded activists could find the most authoritative list of his companies.Meanwhile, Cruz was busy expanding his adversaries for the day from an NBA team owner to \u201cthe lunatic left.\u201d\u201cGiven the assault on America from the violent mobs, from the America-hating crazy left,\u201d Cruz was shown saying in a video he retweeted Monday evening, \u201cnow\u2019s the time when we need to come together and stand as one.\u201dAnd that\u2019s more or less where Cruz and Cuban left things Monday.

Under such laws, Hong Kong authorities can ask Britain to extradite anyone accused of a crime in the city and vice versa.ADBut the new national security law Beijing imposed on Hong Kong this month drew increasing worries that those extradited from Britain could face draconian punishments. Canada and Australia have already suspended similar treaties this month.Residents of Hong Kong, which has been a part of China since 1997, enjoyed a relatively large amount of freedom of speech and other political liberties under Beijing\u2019s \u201cone country, two systems\u201d framework. But under the new laws, the city\u2019s 7.5 million population is under the same speech restrictions as the mainland.ADUnder these laws, anyone deemed guilty of subversion could potentially face life imprisonment.ADIn response, Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s government has said it would offer residency rights and a potential path to citizenship for as many as 3 million Hong Kong citizens. China condemned the move, with Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian telling Britain to \u201cstop interfering in Hong Kong\u2019s affairs and China\u2019s internal affairs.\"Britain had been particularly concerned about Articles 55 to 59 of the controversial national security law, Raab said Monday, as they allowed mainland China authority to assume jurisdiction in certain cases and try those cases in mainland courts.London and Beijing had increasingly warm ties only a few years ago, with many in Britain looking toward trade with China as a key part of the country\u2019s post-European Union economic future. But that has changed as concerns about Hong Kong and other issues grew.Britain announced last week that it would suspend new deployments of Huawei equipment in its fledgling high-speed 5G network, in line with requests from the United States, which said that the Chinese technology company was too close to the Chinese government and posed a national security threat.ADADThe move accompanied a growing concern among the general public about Chinese intentions, with polling data from this year suggesting many Britons wanted a harder line on the country after the novel coronavirus pandemic began.Liu\u2019s appearance on the BBC\u2019s \u201cAndrew Marr Show\u201d on Sunday prompted an angry response from some British public figures. The footage was later aired on China\u2019s state-run television station CGTN, though the sections about the Uighur video were not shown.Keir Starmer, the leader of Britain\u2019s opposition Labour Party, said Monday that suspending the extradition treaty was a \u201cstep in the right direction,\u201d but he added that Johnson\u2019s government should impose sanctions on Chinese officials involved in human rights abuses.\u201cSome of the actions of the [Chinese] government are deeply concerning and we can\u2019t turn a blind eye,\u201d Starmer said in a video posted to his Twitter account.Johnson said Monday that he did not want to become \u201ca knee-jerk Sinophobe on every issue, somebody who is automatically anti-China,\u201d but that his government had \u201cserious concerns\u201d about Hong Kong and Uighurs that could not be ignored.", "comment": "148 Comments", "topic": "Europe"}, {"cover": "", "title": "Kodak lands loan to bolster US-produced drug supply", "date": "Jul 28, 2020", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/kodak/2020/07/28/1636a4a4-d0ee-11ea-826b-cc394d824e35_story.html", "keyword": "China and Security", "website": "the Washington Post", "author": "", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Eastman Kodak will receive a federal loan of $765 million to help reduce reliance on other countries for ingredients in generic drugs, an agreement President Donald Trump hailed Tuesday as a breakthrough in bringing more pharmaceutical manufacturing to the United States.Support our journalism.

The shortage could cripple parts of its business.Support our journalism. Subscribe today.arrow-rightThe Huawei battle is the leading edge of a broad U.S. campaign against Chinese efforts to control key technology sectors, such as the 5G telecom market that Huawei dominates. U.S. and Chinese analysts have both warned in interviews that this technology conflict is leading to a decoupling of the global tech market that might leave both nations worse off.Washington is playing a stronger hand in this tech competition than some analysts have realized. U.S. companies still control the commanding heights, even after rapid Chinese advances. As a result, America\u2019s ability to constrain China, at least in the near term, is greater than generally appreciated.ADAD\u201cIn a decoupled world, we\u2019ll do better than the Chinese can,\u201d contended a senior Trump administration official in an interview Tuesday. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of defeatism around about the U.S. technology position. People don\u2019t understand the enormous technology advantage we have.\u201dThe administration\u2019s upbeat assessment of the strong U.S. position against Huawei is confirmed by details in the new British government report. The British explain that by expanding in May its \u201cEntity List\u201d designation of Huawei, the United States can now prevent sales not only of technology produced by U.S. companies, but also the transfer of systems produced by global companies that depend on U.S. technology or software.\u201cDesigning and building equipment largely independent of US technology or tools within a couple of years presents a truly Herculean task,\u201d argued an unclassified analysis released  July 14 by Britain\u2019s National Cyber Security center, a unit of its communications intelligence agency, known as GCHQ.ADADBecause Huawei depends on semiconductors and chips made by U.S. fabrication technology, \u201cour estimate is that Huawei\u2019s supply will be impacted within the next 3-12 months,\u201d the report noted. Even if Huawei rushed to build its own alternatives, that process would take several years, and the hardware and software would be unreliable.\u201cThe equipment will have been built with unknown and untested tools, created under extreme time pressures. It is highly likely that the quality issues .\u2009.\u2009. will increase significantly,\u201d the British report notes. \u201cIt will be extremely challenging to gain confidence in Huawei\u2019s post-sanction equipment, and it may be impossible.\u201dThe British findings are important, because the British government has been wary of the Trump administration\u2019s push against Huawei and had sought, until now, to preserve the option of keeping Huawei as a 5G supplier.ADADThe Huawei confrontation comes at a time when both Beijing and Washington are flexing their muscles in contested areas. The Chinese suspension of human rights laws in Hong Kong and U.S. reprisals are one example; another is both sides\u2019 assertion of naval power in the South China Sea.U.S. and British officials describe a similar set of challenges to replace a newly constrained and unreliable Huawei as a 5G supplier. In the short run, they hope to bolster alternative European telecom suppliers Nokia and Ericsson; in the medium term, they hope Asian companies such as South Korea\u2019s Samsung and Japan\u2019s Fujitsu and NEC will enter the 5G\u00a0market aggressively.Over the long run, both U.S. and British officials predict that Huawei\u2019s 5G technology will be disrupted by new software-driven systems, such as Open Radio Access Networks, or O-RAN. The senior administration official expressed confidence that the United States and its tech allies will prevail on this front, arguing, \u201cChina doesn\u2019t hold a candle to us in software development.\u201dADADAmerica and its allies also have vulnerabilities. Beijing signaled Monday that it might retaliate by imposing sanctions on Nokia and Ericsson, which depend on some Chinese components. Officials fear that China could try to \u201cliberate\u201d some of the technology Huawei needs by stealing intellectual property or even by seizing plants in Taiwan that fabricate U.S.-designed chips.Any military or covert effort to control the raw materials of this tech war could backfire for China, though. The fabrication plants in Taiwan might not survive intact. And Taiwanese scientists might flee to refuge in the United States, much as German scientists did after World War II.A battle in the tech sector is inherently dangerous, like wrestling over a ball made of glass. A Chinese diplomat in Europe recently offered a menacing warning: \u201cWe treat our friends with fine wine, but for our enemies we have shotguns.\u201dADADTough talk.

The document also reflects the cooperative work of the Biden and Sanders campaigns, which produced a 110-page policy document earlier this month to guide the party.ADADPlatform drafters held three public hearings last month, listening to 50 public speakers, and reviewing thousands of videos, emails and messages providing comments on what should be included in the platform, according to party officials.[Trump calls for a \u2018new and updated\u2019 GOP platform after party moves to keep its 2016 document]\u201cRepairing the damage Donald Trump has done to this country begins with electing Joe Biden this fall and implementing what will be without a doubt the boldest platform in our party\u2019s history,\u201d Bottoms said in a statement. \u201cProgress is rarely easy, but together we can move our country forward and resign Donald Trump to the dustbin of history.\u201dADThe draft sticks with the broad policy priorities of Biden, who is expected to be nominated next month at a largely virtual convention in Milwaukee. But it also makes a point of casting the Democratic Party as accepting of views he does not hold and has said he will not promote.AD\u201cWe are proud our party welcomes advocates who want to build on and strengthen the Affordable Care Act and those who support a Medicare-for-all approach,\u201d the draft reads, \u201call are critical to ensuring that health care is a human right.\u201dOn matters of international trade, Democrats offer particular focus on taking a tougher stand on China. \u201cUnlike President Trump, we will stand up to efforts from China and other state actors to steal America\u2019s intellectual property and will demand China and other countries cease and desist from conducting cyberespionage against our companies,\u201d the draft reads.ADIn an apparent nod to opposition from some building trades unions, the draft platform does not address the question of fracking or oil drilling directly. Biden has proposed a ban on new public leases for natural gas fracking, attracting criticism from Republicans in swing states such as Wisconsin and Pennsylvania.AD\u201cThe Democratic Party platform does not call for banning fracking \u2014 consistent with Joe Biden\u2019s long-standing position,\u201d Biden campaign spokesman Andrew Bates said. Most fracking is conducted on private land, which would be untouched by Biden\u2019s position.The draft also embraces some technologies for slowing climate change, like nuclear and carbon capture and storage, which are opposed by some activists and environmentalists.ADOn the question of military spending, the document does not shy away from the threatened attacks from Trump, who has boasted of increases in defense spending and warned that Democrats would weaken the military.\u201cWe can maintain a strong defense and protect our safety and security for less,\u201d the draft reads. \u201cIt\u2019s past time to rebalance our investments, improve the efficiency and competitiveness of our defense industrial base, conduct rigorous annual audits of the Pentagon, and end waste and fraud.\u201dADIt also embraces Biden\u2019s promise to end  what have been called \u201cforever wars\u201d in places like Afghanistan, while ending U.S. support for the Saudi-led war in Yemen. It calls for rejoining the Paris climate accord and reentering the Iran nuclear agreement.\u201cDemocrats believe the United States should not impose regime change on other countries and reject that as the goal of U.S. policy toward Iran,\u201d the document states.\n\nAnnie Linskey, Matt Viser and Sean Sullivan contributed to this report.", "comment": "220 Comments", "topic": "Politics"}, {"cover": "", "title": " Is Getting Closer to Its Lehman Moment", "date": "Jul 21, 2020", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/china-is-getting-closer-to-its-lehman-moment/2020/07/20/d98902ac-cadc-11ea-99b0-8426e26d203b_story.html", "keyword": "China and Security", "website": "the Washington Post", "author": "", "content": "Wall Street\u2019s movers and shakers are largely seen as part of the solution to the coronavirus-ravaged\u00a0economy.

In this crisis, they\u2019re no longer the problem.Support our journalism. Subscribe today.arrow-rightThe same\u00a0can\u2019t be said of China. Beijing has made martyrs of its\u00a0banks and insurers, asking them to lend to the needy, forgo profits and support the animal spirits of its trillion-dollar capital markets. But, along with brokers, they\u2019re\u00a0still a troubled bunch, far from being sturdy pillars of the\u00a0financial system. If\u00a0anything, Covid-19 has exacerbated credit risks. China\u2019s\u00a0Lehman moment, when isolated events cross the line into systemic effects,\u00a0is just lurking around the corner.Last Friday, regulators took\u00a0control of nine troubled firms, controlled by fallen billionaire Xiao Jianhua\u2019s empire\u00a0under Tomorrow Holding Co., totaling\u00a0more than\u00a01.2 trillion yuan ($171.5 billion) in total assets. It\u2019s\u00a0one of the largest seizures\u00a0in China\u2019s\u00a0recent history.\u00a0 Xiao was taken from\u00a0Hong Kong\u2019s Four Seasons hotel by Chinese authorities\u00a0three years ago\u00a0and has disappeared from the public eye since.That is unsurprising: Insurers have been problematic since at least 2017. A review then found that their\u00a0corporate governance scores were deteriorating. Companies like Huaxia Life Insurance Co., one of the seized firms, were selling policies that\u00a0flouted\u00a0rules and improperly disclosed\u00a0policyholders\u2019 information. The\u00a0insurance regulator\u00a0said\u00a0it was \u201cdetermined to weed out illegal and improper practices.\u201d It also found that companies were falsifying funding sources and\u00a0leveraging the same assets for multiple loans.The takeovers come a year\u00a0after\u00a0the seizure of Baoshang Bank Co.,\u00a0when we wrote\u00a0that counterparty\u00a0\u00a0and solvency risks had arrived \u2014\u00a0together. Regulators tried to say then that it was\u00a0a one-time solution. Yet, the most recent\u00a0events point to these issues\u00a0becoming acute, and spreading. At some point, the chain of lending and liquidity will be\u00a0disrupted.Beijing has once again shied away from letting the market price such likelihoods.\u00a0\u201cThe dilemma is fundamental,\u201d as analysts at Rhodium Group wrote after the Baoshang incident. Authorities can allow the market to digest failures, or\u00a0try to maintain \u201cstable\u201d production of ever-riskier\u00a0forms of credit.\u00a0They can\u2019t have both. By\u00a0effectively assuming counterparty risk, regulators are hurting\u00a0market\u00a0credibility at a time of rising\u00a0jitters\u00a0as financing channels are squeezed.To be fair, they didn\u2019t have much choice.\u00a0Heavily leveraged, a single-digit percentage drop in asset value\u00a0induced by Covid-19 could wipe out these firms\u2019 equity book value. Take Huaxia Life. Over the last decade, via aggressive selling of high-yield savings products, it\u00a0has become the fourth-largest insurer in China, with close to 600 billion yuan in total assets at the end of\u00a02019. Its assets-to-equity ratio\u00a0stood at a whopping 26 times.ADADIt\u2019s not hard to imagine large asset writedowns behind closed doors. As the impacts of Covid-19\u00a0distressed businesses in\u00a0the second quarter, the worst bond rout in a decade caused investors to nurse losses on even relatively safe wealth management products, not to mention riskier non-credit investments. In the first three months of the year,\u00a0data provided by CLSA Ltd. show that Huaxia Life\u2019s book value shrank by 23%\u00a0 quarter-on-quarter, due to\u00a0mark-to-market losses of\u00a0its investments. It\u2019s no wonder that the insurer is on regulators\u2019 radar, or that they\u2019re trying to send a message.Still, China\u2019s financial woes extend beyond a fugitive businessman\u2019s overly extended balance sheet. Since 1995, only 12 firms have been seized by the central bank or other agencies\u00a0\u2014\u00a0half of them\u00a0over the last year, excluding the ones last week. Some  large trust companies have fallen afoul of authorities, unable to pay back investors\u2019 principal and interest in recent months.Under\u00a0the latest takeovers, regulators will send teams to take the roles of shareholders, directors and management. Other financial firms, including some of China\u2019s largest insurers and securities houses, will end up as trustees. In theory, they\u2019ll\u00a0push to\u00a0shrink\u00a0the troubled businesses and monetize assets.ADADCall it what you want, but this is China\u2019s version of financial contagion. Just plugging holes will no longer cut it. How many firms can regulators try to salvage? How much capital will be injected? Can they find willing shareholders and white knights?\u00a0The answers to such questions won\u2019t come\u00a0without pain. According to CLSA, 11 insurers\u00a0with about 15% of the market and 2.4 trillion yuan in total assets\u00a0would be \u201cwalking a tightrope\u201d with\u00a0regulators. On average, if their asset value was 2% to 5% less\u00a0than what they showed in\u00a02019, their surplus capital \u2014 the\u00a0capital over the minimum regulatory red line \u2014\u00a0would have been wiped out. If Beijing ever needs to rescue them all,\u00a0the costs would be enormous.\u00a0If not, the insurers would have no choice but to dump assets, which could threaten the broader market.So far, Beijing hasn\u2019t successfully unwound troublesome financial empires. In the two years since the overextended buyer of New York\u2019s Waldorf Astoria, Anbang Insurance Group Co., was seized, attempts to dispose of its assets and find strategic investors have turned into a prolonged and painful process.\u00a0ADADIt may be time for Beijing to face its fears and let some companies fall off the cliff. In doing so, it may finally be able to save the ones that really matter.\u00a0This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Anjani Trivedi is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering industrial companies in Asia.

Now it may result in a powerful new blow to U.S. interests, in the form of an Iranian partnership with China that could rescue Iran\u2019s economy while giving Beijing a powerful new place in the region.Support our journalism. Subscribe today.arrow-rightAn agreement approved by Iranian President Hassan Rouhani last month could lead to billions of dollars in Chinese investments in Iran, in exchange for a steady and discounted stream of Iranian oil, according to the New York Times. The deal also envisages security cooperation, including joint military exercises and the sharing of weapons development and intelligence, according to an 18-page draft the Times obtained.It\u2019s not certain the pact will go forward: It has yet to be publicly unveiled and must be approved by the Iranian parliament, where it could encounter nationalist resistance. But if it does, it will not only rupture the wall of sanctions that the Trump administration has constructed in an attempt to strangle the Iranian economy; it will also mark a significant escalation of China\u2019s challenge to U.S.\u00a0global influence.ADADAs with the mounting U.S. conflict with Iran, that was not inevitable. The regime of Xi Jinping supported the pressure campaign against Iran conducted by the Obama administration as well as the nuclear accord it led to, which was meant to restrain Iran\u2019s uranium enrichment and other nuclear development for a decade or more. Even after Mr. Trump withdrew from the deal in 2018, Beijing at first generally adhered to the new U.S. sanctions, reducing oil purchases and other trade.Yet Mr. Trump\u2019s confrontational approach to China in recent months, including his refusal to continue work on a comprehensive trade deal, has given Mr. Xi little incentive to cooperate with Washington\u2019s geopolitical priorities. On the contrary, the Chinese leadership likely perceives a moment of critical U.S. weakness as Mr. Trump flounders amid a health and economic crisis and is moving to take advantage. It is expanding its presence in the South China Sea; it is crushing Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy.  Allying itself with the foremost U.S. adversary in the Middle East opens yet another front.Mr. Trump and his aides have directed plenty of bluster at China in recent weeks, and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo offered more when the prospective Iran-China accord came up at a news conference last week. Pointing to the possibility that China would sell arms to Iran under the deal, he said that was reason to extend a U.N. embargo on arms sales to Iran when it expires in October. Yet that can\u2019t happen without Beijing\u2019s agreement.ADADMr. Pompeo also threatened sanctions against Chinese companies that do business with Iran. Again, that might have been a substantial deterrent before Mr. Trump launched his reckless trade war. Now, China may perceive it has more to gain by shielding U.S. adversaries from \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d \u2014 and demonstrating U.S. impotence.Read more:Jason Rezaian: In deep trouble, Iran grabs a Chinese lifelineJason Rezaian: One thing the virus hasn\u2019t changed: Iran and the U.S. still hate each otherElisa Massimino and Alexandra Schmitt: Pompeo\u2019s new commission undermines universal human rights \u2014 just as plannedDana Milbank: Trump\u2019s ignorance is total \u2014 and you can quote his press secretary on thatJackson Diehl: How Netanyahu is already planning for a Biden presidency", "comment": "105 Comments", "topic": "The Post's View"}, {"cover": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/5DEG6EWG44I6VKBFQ4RAATSBKA.jpghttps://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/5DEG6EWG44I6VKBFQ4RAATSBKA.jpg", "title": "The Cybersecurity 202: Twitter breach is another warning shot for election ", "date": "Jul 16, 2020", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/the-cybersecurity-202/2020/07/16/the-cybersecurity-202-twitter-breach-is-another-warning-shot-for-election-security/5f0f7e14602ff1080719cbdc/", "keyword": "China and Security", "website": "the Washington Post", "author": "Joseph Marks", "content": "with Tonya RileyThis time, the massive Twitter hack yesterday was seemingly just a petty scam to raise bitcoin \u2014 at least based on what's known so far.

It took Twitter hours of work and an unprecedented shutdown of all verified accounts to halt the operation, as Rachel Lerman, Cat Zakrzewski and I report.U.S. adversaries that gained that sort of power could sow mass chaos on Election Day by tweeting out phony information about voter fraud or polling locations shut down by the coronavirus or terrorist attacks. And because the breach targeted Twitter controls, over which campaigns are powerless, they might have no power to stop the stream of phony tweets from flowing.ADADIf Twitter once again shut down verified accounts' ability to tweet while it investigated a breach, that would also cut off a key avenue for campaigns, government officials and law enforcement to correct misinformation.\u00a0Such an attack could be particularly disastrous during a close election if people don't vote because of the confusion.\u00a0\u201cRussia\u2019s most dangerous play is how do you inflict the maximum amount of chaos on Election Day,\u201d Clint Watts, a\u00a0distinguished research fellow\u00a0at the Foreign Policy Research Institute who tracks Russian influence operations, told me. \u201cThey want to further erode confidence in democracy, and this is emblematic of a way they can do that.\u201d\u00a0ADRachel Tobac, chief executive of SocialProof Security, called the breach very concerning. \u201cWe are extremely lucky that these attackers are monetarily motivated and not sowing mass chaos all over the world,\u201d she said.\u00a0ADOther prominent victims of the breach included the Uber and Apple corporate accounts, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, Tesla founder Elon Musk, musician Kanye West and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. (Bezos also owns The Washington Post.) Those accounts all posted tweets instructing people to send cryptocurrency to the same bitcoin address over the course of about 90 minutes.\u00a0The bitcoin wallet the tweets pointed to appeared to receive more than $115,000.\u00a0The breach underscores the vast array of avenues hackers could take to undermine the election.\u00a0It also provides a window into the long list of possible attacks the Biden and Trump campaigns need to be planning for as November approaches.\u00a0ADIn the case of an Election Day version of the Twitter breach, campaigns should be gaming out how to correct misinformation through traditional media and through other social media that isn\u2019t compromised, Mick Baccio, a security adviser at Splunk, told me. Baccio ran cybersecurity for former South Bend, Ind., mayor Pete Buttigieg\u2019s presidential primary campaign but left shortly before the Iowa caucuses.\u00a0AD\u201cYou have to plan for all these horrible scenarios and you have to have the principals in the room to figure out, \u2018What will you do if this happens? What\u2019s the incident response?\u2019\u201d he said.\u00a0Campaigns should also try to establish strong relationships in advance with the people they\u2019ll need in those situations, such as Twitter\u2019s cybersecurity executives, Baccio said.\u00a0AD\u201cYou have to know what\u2019s inside your scope and what\u2019s not and having contacts at those places is invaluable,\u201d he said.\u00a0This isn\u2019t the first time a Twitter hack has caused widespread confusion.\u00a0Watts compared the breach to a 2013 hack of the Associated Press\u2019s Twitter account that the Syrian Electronic Army claimed credit for. The hacking group, whose members are partisans of embattled Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, sent multiple tweets claiming \u00a0the White House had been bombed and that President Barack Obama was injured. They caused chaos online and briefly tanked the stock market, causing a temporary loss of $136 billion in the S&P 500.\u00a0ADADThat was just one Twitter account whose tweets were quickly refuted by other news agencies \u2014 including by reporters at the White House who could verify everything was fine. Things could be far more complicated if multiple accounts were tweeting false information that couldn\u2019t be so easily refuted.\u00a0More recently, Twitter founder Jack Dorsey\u2019s account was hacked and tweeted a string of obscenities, threats and racial slurs in 2019.\u00a0It\u2019s unclear how much information the hackers were able to cull from the Twitter accounts they compromised.\u00a0If they were able to access the accounts\u2019 direct messages, they might have stolen information they could leak later to embarrass the victims or to sow chaos during the 2020 election or another major event, Theresa Payton, chief executive of the cybersecurity company Fortalice Solutions and a former White House technology official, told me.ADADIt's also possible the hackers stole information from accounts that they didn't use as part of the bitcoin scam that they could later leak or sell to someone with political motivations. For example, President Trump has among the most closely watched Twitter accounts in the world but his account wasn't used in the scheme.\u00a0\u201cWe could be looking at the potential for a huge hacking and dumping campaign,\u201d Payton said.Twitter described the breach as a \u201ccoordinated social engineering attack\u201d aimed at its employees. It said it was \u201clooking into what other malicious activity they may have conducted or information they may have accessed.\u201dDorsey also promised to share more information as soon as the company completes its investigation.\u00a0It's also unclear how the hackers gained access to the Twitter accounts.\u00a0The company's brief accounting suggested the hackers conned Twitter employees into unwittingly giving up information that provided the access. But Vice's Joseph Cox spoke with people who claimed to be responsible for the breach who said they paid a Twitter employee for help gaining access.\u00a0ADADTwitter is also investigating whether an employee might have hijacked the accounts directly and then passed the access along to the hackers, Cox reports.\u00a0One prominent theory, outlined by Vice\u2019s Cox, is that hackers gained access to an internal panel that Twitter employees use to interact with user accounts and were using that access to post their bitcoin scheme to prominent accounts.\u00a0In many cases, the account owners or Twitter were able to quickly delete the scam tweets, suggesting that the hacker hadn\u2019t locked them out of the accounts entirely.\u00a0Chat roomThe Twitter hack also sent shock waves through the cybersecurity community. Google's Shane Huntley drew the lesson that even cybersecurity savvy folks can be conned by phishing attacks.\u00a0Electronic Frontier Foundation Cybersecurity Director Eva Galperin made an argument for more fully encrypting direct messages to protect them against being stolen.The hackers\u2019 seeming profit was pretty paltry, the Daily Beast\u2019s Adam Ranwsley noted:The keysTrump granted the CIA broad authorities to launch secret cyberattacks in 2018.The authorization allowed the agency to launch a wide range of hacks without White House approval and specifically named Russia, China, Iran and North Korea as likely targets, Zach Dorfman, Kim Zetter, Jenna McLaughlin and Sean D. Naylor report for Yahoo News.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0ADADThe agency has carried out at least a dozen covert hacking operations since then, including hacking and dumping files from Iran and Russia, former officials told Yahoo.The new authorities also allowed the agency to more easily conduct covert cyberoperations against banks, media organizations and charities suspected of working with adversary governments.\u00a0\u00a0The White House also expanded authorities for U.S. Cyber Command to launch offensive hacking operations in 2018. That helped enable operations against a Russian troll farm during the 2018 midterm elections and against an Iranian military unit in retaliation for shooting down a U.S. drone.The State Department will restrict U.S. visas of some Huawei employees, citing human rights abuses.Secretary of State Mike Pompeo accused the Huawei employees of providing \u201cmaterial support\u201d to the Chinese Communist Party at a news conference.ADThe action also applies to several other Chinese companies the United States has sanctioned for allegedly aiding human rights abuses. The move is the latest escalation in the United States\u2019 war against Huawei, which it has accused of aiding Chinese government spying.\u201cTelecommunications companies around the world should consider themselves on notice,\u201d Pompeo said.\u00a0\u201cIf they are doing business with Huawei, they are doing business with human rights abusers.\u201dPompeo also praised the United Kingdom\u2019s decision to phase out Huawei\u2019s equipment from its 5G telecom networks.\u00a0\u201cThis isn\u2019t about commercial interests, this is about protecting the information,\u201d Pompeo said. \u201cI think in fact the tide has turned there and you\u2019ll see this continue in [other] countries.\u201d\u00a0Pompeo is also sounding alarms about election interference.\u00a0The secretary of state said he\u2019s \u201cconfident\u201d foreign countries \u201cwould do their best to have an impact\u201d on the 2020 election, during a virtual event hosted by the Hill, Maggie Miller reports.\u201cForeign efforts to interfere in American elections is something we constantly must contend with, and we\u2019ll contend with that here,\u201d Pompeo said.Pompeo believes the U.S. government will be able to knock back those efforts, he stressed.\u201cWhether it\u2019s Chinese interference, Iranian interference, Russian interference, or North Korean interference, any country, or even nonstate actors who now have capabilities to try to meddle in our elections, know that this administration takes seriously its responsibility to make sure every American\u2019s vote is counted, counted properly, and that foreign influence is minimized,\u201d he said.Hill watchA group of bipartisan lawmakers stumped for a new national cyber director during a House Oversight Committee hearing.\u00a0The new position was a key recommendation of the Cyberspace Solarium Commission.

And because the breach targeted Twitter controls, over which campaigns are powerless, they might have no power to stop the stream of phony tweets from flowing.ADADIf Twitter once again shut down verified accounts' ability to tweet while it investigated a breach, that would also cut off a key avenue for campaigns, government officials and law enforcement to correct misinformation.\u00a0Such an attack could be particularly disastrous during a close election if people don't vote because of the confusion.\u00a0\u201cRussia\u2019s most dangerous play is how do you inflict the maximum amount of chaos on Election Day,\u201d Clint Watts, a\u00a0distinguished research fellow\u00a0at the Foreign Policy Research Institute who tracks Russian influence operations, told me. \u201cThey want to further erode confidence in democracy, and this is emblematic of a way they can do that.\u201d\u00a0ADRachel Tobac, chief executive of SocialProof Security, called the breach very concerning. \u201cWe are extremely lucky that these attackers are monetarily motivated and not sowing mass chaos all over the world,\u201d she said.\u00a0ADOther prominent victims of the breach included the Uber and Apple corporate accounts, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, Tesla founder Elon Musk, musician Kanye West and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. (Bezos also owns The Washington Post.) Those accounts all posted tweets instructing people to send cryptocurrency to the same bitcoin address over the course of about 90 minutes.\u00a0The bitcoin wallet the tweets pointed to appeared to receive more than $115,000.\u00a0The breach underscores the vast array of avenues hackers could take to undermine the election.\u00a0It also provides a window into the long list of possible attacks the Biden and Trump campaigns need to be planning for as November approaches.\u00a0ADIn the case of an Election Day version of the Twitter breach, campaigns should be gaming out how to correct misinformation through traditional media and through other social media that isn\u2019t compromised, Mick Baccio, a security adviser at Splunk, told me. Baccio ran cybersecurity for former South Bend, Ind., mayor Pete Buttigieg\u2019s presidential primary campaign but left shortly before the Iowa caucuses.\u00a0AD\u201cYou have to plan for all these horrible scenarios and you have to have the principals in the room to figure out, \u2018What will you do if this happens? What\u2019s the incident response?\u2019\u201d he said.\u00a0Campaigns should also try to establish strong relationships in advance with the people they\u2019ll need in those situations, such as Twitter\u2019s cybersecurity executives, Baccio said.\u00a0AD\u201cYou have to know what\u2019s inside your scope and what\u2019s not and having contacts at those places is invaluable,\u201d he said.\u00a0This isn\u2019t the first time a Twitter hack has caused widespread confusion.\u00a0Watts compared the breach to a 2013 hack of the Associated Press\u2019s Twitter account that the Syrian Electronic Army claimed credit for. The hacking group, whose members are partisans of embattled Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, sent multiple tweets claiming \u00a0the White House had been bombed and that President Barack Obama was injured. They caused chaos online and briefly tanked the stock market, causing a temporary loss of $136 billion in the S&P 500.\u00a0ADADThat was just one Twitter account whose tweets were quickly refuted by other news agencies \u2014 including by reporters at the White House who could verify everything was fine. Things could be far more complicated if multiple accounts were tweeting false information that couldn\u2019t be so easily refuted.\u00a0More recently, Twitter founder Jack Dorsey\u2019s account was hacked and tweeted a string of obscenities, threats and racial slurs in 2019.\u00a0It\u2019s unclear how much information the hackers were able to cull from the Twitter accounts they compromised.\u00a0If they were able to access the accounts\u2019 direct messages, they might have stolen information they could leak later to embarrass the victims or to sow chaos during the 2020 election or another major event, Theresa Payton, chief executive of the cybersecurity company Fortalice Solutions and a former White House technology official, told me.ADADIt's also possible the hackers stole information from accounts that they didn't use as part of the bitcoin scam that they could later leak or sell to someone with political motivations. For example, President Trump has among the most closely watched Twitter accounts in the world but his account wasn't used in the scheme.\u00a0\u201cWe could be looking at the potential for a huge hacking and dumping campaign,\u201d Payton said.Twitter described the breach as a \u201ccoordinated social engineering attack\u201d aimed at its employees. It said it was \u201clooking into what other malicious activity they may have conducted or information they may have accessed.\u201dDorsey also promised to share more information as soon as the company completes its investigation.\u00a0It's also unclear how the hackers gained access to the Twitter accounts.\u00a0The company's brief accounting suggested the hackers conned Twitter employees into unwittingly giving up information that provided the access. But Vice's Joseph Cox spoke with people who claimed to be responsible for the breach who said they paid a Twitter employee for help gaining access.\u00a0ADADTwitter is also investigating whether an employee might have hijacked the accounts directly and then passed the access along to the hackers, Cox reports.\u00a0One prominent theory, outlined by Vice\u2019s Cox, is that hackers gained access to an internal panel that Twitter employees use to interact with user accounts and were using that access to post their bitcoin scheme to prominent accounts.\u00a0In many cases, the account owners or Twitter were able to quickly delete the scam tweets, suggesting that the hacker hadn\u2019t locked them out of the accounts entirely.\u00a0Chat roomThe Twitter hack also sent shock waves through the cybersecurity community. Google's Shane Huntley drew the lesson that even cybersecurity savvy folks can be conned by phishing attacks.\u00a0Electronic Frontier Foundation Cybersecurity Director Eva Galperin made an argument for more fully encrypting direct messages to protect them against being stolen.The hackers\u2019 seeming profit was pretty paltry, the Daily Beast\u2019s Adam Ranwsley noted:The keysTrump granted the CIA broad authorities to launch secret cyberattacks in 2018.The authorization allowed the agency to launch a wide range of hacks without White House approval and specifically named Russia, China, Iran and North Korea as likely targets, Zach Dorfman, Kim Zetter, Jenna McLaughlin and Sean D. Naylor report for Yahoo News.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0ADADThe agency has carried out at least a dozen covert hacking operations since then, including hacking and dumping files from Iran and Russia, former officials told Yahoo.The new authorities also allowed the agency to more easily conduct covert cyberoperations against banks, media organizations and charities suspected of working with adversary governments.\u00a0\u00a0The White House also expanded authorities for U.S. Cyber Command to launch offensive hacking operations in 2018. That helped enable operations against a Russian troll farm during the 2018 midterm elections and against an Iranian military unit in retaliation for shooting down a U.S. drone.The State Department will restrict U.S. visas of some Huawei employees, citing human rights abuses.Secretary of State Mike Pompeo accused the Huawei employees of providing \u201cmaterial support\u201d to the Chinese Communist Party at a news conference.ADThe action also applies to several other Chinese companies the United States has sanctioned for allegedly aiding human rights abuses. The move is the latest escalation in the United States\u2019 war against Huawei, which it has accused of aiding Chinese government spying.\u201cTelecommunications companies around the world should consider themselves on notice,\u201d Pompeo said.\u00a0\u201cIf they are doing business with Huawei, they are doing business with human rights abusers.\u201dPompeo also praised the United Kingdom\u2019s decision to phase out Huawei\u2019s equipment from its 5G telecom networks.\u00a0\u201cThis isn\u2019t about commercial interests, this is about protecting the information,\u201d Pompeo said. \u201cI think in fact the tide has turned there and you\u2019ll see this continue in [other] countries.\u201d\u00a0Pompeo is also sounding alarms about election interference.\u00a0The secretary of state said he\u2019s \u201cconfident\u201d foreign countries \u201cwould do their best to have an impact\u201d on the 2020 election, during a virtual event hosted by the Hill, Maggie Miller reports.\u201cForeign efforts to interfere in American elections is something we constantly must contend with, and we\u2019ll contend with that here,\u201d Pompeo said.Pompeo believes the U.S. government will be able to knock back those efforts, he stressed.\u201cWhether it\u2019s Chinese interference, Iranian interference, Russian interference, or North Korean interference, any country, or even nonstate actors who now have capabilities to try to meddle in our elections, know that this administration takes seriously its responsibility to make sure every American\u2019s vote is counted, counted properly, and that foreign influence is minimized,\u201d he said.Hill watchA group of bipartisan lawmakers stumped for a new national cyber director during a House Oversight Committee hearing.\u00a0The new position was a key recommendation of the Cyberspace Solarium Commission. That recommendation has wide support among cybersecurity hawks in Congress, but the White House opposes it.

Subscribe today.arrow-rightIn a speech in Michigan, Barr accused U.S. companies of \u201ckowtowing\u201d to China for the sake of short-term profits and alleged that China\u2019s Communist Party has recently \u201cstepped up\u201d efforts to \u201ccoerce\u201d American business executives to push its agenda with U.S. lawmakers.\u201cHiding behind American voices allows the Chinese government to elevate its influence and put a \u2018friendly face\u2019 on pro-regime policies,\u201d Barr said in remarks at the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Museum.AD\u201cAmerica\u2019s corporate leaders might not think of themselves as lobbyists,\u201d he added. \u201cBut you should be alert to how you might be used, and how your efforts on behalf of a foreign company or government could implicate the Foreign Agents Registration Act,\u201d he said, referring to the law requiring agents or lobbyists for foreign entities to disclose themselves to the Justice Department.ADBarr\u2019s remarks are the latest sign of the Trump administration\u2019s increasingly strident stance on China. In recent days, President Trump has signed legislation to punish China for its crackdown on Hong Kong and to potentially sanction Chinese officials for their role in detaining Uighurs and other ethnic minorities in camps.California rejected Chinese company\u2019s push to help with coronavirus testing. Was that the right move?The State Department also has ratcheted up tension by calling China\u2019s maritime claims in the South China Sea \u201ccompletely unlawful\u201d and by announcing visa restrictions for certain employees of Chinese companies, including telecom giant Huawei.ADBarr described his speech Thursday as part of a string of recent remarks by administration officials, including national security adviser Robert C. O\u2019Brien and FBI Director Christopher A. Wray, aimed at prompting the \u201cAmerican people to reevaluate their relationship with China, so long as it continues to be ruled by the Communist Party.\u201dAD\u201cThe ultimate ambition of China\u2019s rulers isn\u2019t to trade with the United States. It is to raid the United States. If you are an American business leader, appeasing the PRC may bring short-term rewards. But in the end, the PRC\u2019s goal is to replace you,\u201d Barr said.The attorney general\u2019s warnings drew criticism from some economists, who said he at times exaggerated the threat China poses and downplayed benefits American industry has gained by trading with China, such as the large volume of automobile sales that have helped bolster U.S. carmakers.ADThe speech \u201cseems designed to show the world that the U.S. will interpret every action of multinational firms operating in China through a lens of bilateral hostility,\u201d said Mary Lovely, an economics professor at Syracuse University. Parts of the speech suggested that \u201cif you are not against them, you\u2019re against us,\u201d she added.3M will import masks from China for U.S. to resolve dispute with Trump administrationScott Kennedy, an expert on China trade at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said he agrees the United States needs to do more to counteract China\u2019s unfair or illegal trade tactics, such as intellectual property theft.AD\u201cBut the implication I get from his speech,\u201d Kennedy added, \u201cis he thinks competition is impossible to win, and the only solution is decoupling. And I think that\u2019s wrong for the American economy and would harm our national security.\u201dADDavid Laufman, a former senior official in the Justice Department\u2019s national security division, called the speech an \u201cextraordinary broadside\u201d against China.\u201cAnd coming from the attorney general, it underscores the prominent role that the Department of Justice is now playing in an increasingly aggressive whole-of-government campaign to counter nefarious Chinese activities directed at the U.S.,\u201d he said.Barr cited tech companies and Hollywood for particular criticism, saying they had censored movies and Internet content to appease Chinese officials. He steered clear of other industries, including the oil and gas sector, that have also earned big profits trading with China.ADAD\u201cFor example, Apple recently removed the news app Quartz from its app store in China, after the Chinese government complained about coverage of the Hong Kong democracy protests,\u201d Barr said. \u201cApple also removed apps for virtual private networks, which had allowed users to circumvent the Great Firewall, and eliminated pro-democracy songs from its Chinese music store.\u201dTrump\u2019s Huawei sanctions underscore U.S. dependency on China techBarr also criticized Apple for transferring some of its iCloud data to servers in China, \u201cdespite concerns that the move would give the CCP easier access to emails, text messages and other user information stored in the cloud.\u201dApple spokesman Fred Sainz referred to the company\u2019s past statements on the matters.AD\u201cEach country in which we do business has its own customs, culture and legal process. While our values and beliefs don\u2019t change from country to country, we are subject to each country\u2019s laws,\u201d Apple\u2019s past statements said.AD\u201cChina recently enacted laws requiring that cloud services offered to their citizens be operated by Chinese companies and that Chinese customers\u2019 data be stored in the country. While we advocated against iCloud being subject to these laws, we were ultimately unsuccessful. Our choice was to offer iCloud under the new laws or discontinue offering the service,\u201d the company said.Barr said he believed \u201cWalt Disney would be disheartened to see how the company he founded deals with the foreign dictatorships of our day.\u201dThe Chinese film business is doing the unthinkable: Thriving without HollywoodHe cited few examples, however, saying only that the company two decades ago had apologized for \u201cKundun,\u201d Martin Scorsese\u2019s favorable movie about the Dalai Lama, and that Disney had agreed to give Chinese government officials a role in the management of Shanghai Disney. \u201cOf the park\u2019s 11,000 full-time employees, 300 are active members of the Communist Party,\u201d Barr said.ADADA Disney spokesman didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.China\u2019s theatrical-movie business last year generated about $9 billion in box-office revenue, less than the $11 billion generated in the United States in 2019, but more than the next six international markets combined.To appease Chinese censors, studios allow for racy or anarchic scenes to be taken out of films and also generally steer clear of Chinese villains for any movies they hope to screen in the country.Movies with messages of chaos and anarchy, such as \u201cThe Joker,\u201d are not granted coveted distribution slots by the Chinese government, which closely guards the market and allows only several dozen Hollywood movies to be screened in China each year.ADDisney has by far the largest entertainment collaboration with the country. Shanghai Disney is majority-owned by a three-company group that is owned by the Shanghai government, and many of its movies land on the coveted distribution list.ADThe trade war has limited the access of some American movies, making it harder for them to get on approved lists.And China has been engaged in a massive push in the past several years to grow its domestic movie product \u2014 an effort that has met with success. The five highest-grossing movies at the Chinese box office last year were not Hollywood blockbusters but Chinese productions.Ellen Nakashima contributed to this report.

Subscribe today.arrow-rightTikTok\u2019s connection to China invites legitimate concerns about data mining. Though TikTok is mostly full of goofy lip-synching and perplexing meme-making, it collects far more than what its users post \u2014 from IP addresses to locations to browsing histories. This is true of most social media sites, and the surest guard against the practice would be a sensible federal privacy law. But most social media sites in the United States aren\u2019t under the thumb of an authoritarian regime. Certainly, allegations of a real-time information pipeline to the Politburo are far-fetched; no evidence exists to show that TikTok has given information to Chinese authorities so far. But the question isn\u2019t only what has happened; it\u2019s what could happen. President Xi Jinping\u2019s government does have the ability to demand data of domestic firms, leaving them little option but to comply.ADADThese worries would make it reasonable for the federal government to bar employees from downloading TikTok, as the military has already done. Whether it\u2019s reasonable to prevent everyday Americans is a more difficult question.

These questions are precisely those the ongoing national security review of TikTok should answer \u2014 as well as whether any threats could be addressed through a change in ownership structure.TikTok has been gesturing at such a change itself. The company has also tried to distance itself from China by pulling out of Hong Kong in response to Beijing\u2019s imposition of a sweeping security law on the formerly semi-autonomous region. Yet the White House has signaled that none of these steps will appease it. The point, it seems, really is retribution against another country rather than protection of this one. TikTok won\u2019t be the last app from abroad to raise security worries at home.

The National Defense Strategy of 2018 repeatedly refers to Beijing\u2019s militaristic and predatory behavior as a challenge that the United States needs to counteract.ADThe president, however, has a long track record of lavishing praise on Xi \u2014 a \u201cfriend of mine\u201d and an \u201cincredible guy\u201d \u2014 and paying little attention to matters other than trade. His attacks on China\u2019s role in the novel coronavirus pandemic look more like blame-shifting than sincere concern about Chinese authoritarianism.The United States committed itself to protecting Taiwan when it recognized the People\u2019s Republic of China and withdrew recognition of Taiwan. The Taiwan Relations Act (TRA) of 1979 (for which then-Sen. Joe Biden voted) aimed to ensure that Taiwan\u2019s future is determined by peaceful means. Anything else, the TRA said, would be deemed \u201ca threat to the peace and security of the Western Pacific area and of grave concern to the United States.\u201d The United States vowed to \u201cmaintain the capacity\u201d to \u201cresist any resort to force or other forms of coercion\u201d of Taiwan.ADThat has been U.S. policy for four decades. But Trump has struck a less-than-enthusiastic tone when it comes to protecting alliances, let alone defending allies.ADTrump\u2019s abandonment of Syria\u2019s Kurds, who had done most of the fighting and dying alongside the United States against the Islamic State, made the weakness of Washington\u2019s commitments under Trump chillingly clear.Trump is keenly aware that Taiwan is a mere speck when compared with the Chinese behemoth. In his recent memoir, former national security adviser John Bolton recounts Xi\u2019s repeated efforts to convince Trump that Taiwan belongs to China, and that the relationship between the United States and China would suffer if the United States ignored that. Trump appeared to acquiesce.ADAs Bolton recalls, Trump would \u201cpoint to the tip of one of his Sharpies and say, \u2018This is Taiwan,\u2019 then point to the Resolute desk and say, 'This is China.\u2019\u201dWould China make a move against Taiwan? Until recently, Beijing would have been deterred by international opinion and the prospect of pushback from the United States.ADBut lately, Beijing has become increasingly willing to flout international views. The imposition of a new security law in Hong Kong disregards Beijing\u2019s commitment to the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d principle it made in 1997, when Britain handed over the territory and China promised that Hong Kong would remain free until 2047.ADHong Kong is only one place where Beijing has shown a willingness to flex its muscle. In Xinjiang province, it has built concentration camps \u2014 it calls them reeducation camps \u2014 where it holds more than a million ethnic Uighurs, a Muslim minority, despite the world\u2019s protestations. It\u2019s the largest imprisonment of a religious minority since the Holocaust.According to Bolton, during one of their meetings, Xi told Trump about the camps. The interpreter said Trump\u2019s response was that building camps was the right thing to do. On the day that tidbit became public, Trump signed a bill aiming to punish China for abusing Uighurs.ADThere\u2019s little reason to expect Trump would stand up for Taiwan out of a sense of loyalty or moral outrage.ADBeyond its frontiers, China has been pushing against India\u2019s border, expanding control of international waters in the South China Sea, buzzing Taiwan with fighter jets and generally seeking to expand its influence through diplomacy, finances, and intimidation.If China decided to make a military play for Taiwan, Trump, who talks a hawkish game but doesn\u2019t always walk it, might be persuaded to stand up to China. But from what we have seen, his instinct would cry out against U.S. involvement for a small ally, especially if it would spoil relations with a powerful trading partner.As for Biden, he is hardly a hawk. There are no guarantees for Taiwan regardless of the election\u2019s outcome, which is why Taipei is rushing to bolster its military capabilities. But Biden is committed to the status quo in Taiwan; he has spoken out forcefully against Xi\u2019s treatment of Uighurs and in support of Taiwan\u2019s \u201cthriving democracy.\u201d He intends to return U.S. foreign policy to the pre-Trump track of safeguarding U.S. alliances and valuing democracy. That stance alone would give Beijing pause before acting against Taiwan.ADADAll considered, Biden looks like a safer bet than Trump for the survival of Taiwan\u2019s independence from the increasingly aggressive regime in Beijing.Read more:John Pomfret: The Hong Kong security law could be China\u2019s blueprint to deal with the \u2018Taiwan problem\u2019Josh Rogin: The pandemic shows why Taiwan is a far better partner than the People\u2019s RepublicArthur Tam: Hong Kong and Taiwan are cultural powerhouses.

How does the law affect the internet?Under the implementation guidance, police can ask technology and telecommunications companies -- be they platforms like Facebook Inc. or Twitter Inc., website hosts like GoDaddy Inc. or internet service providers -- to delete or restrict access to certain messages that authorities deem may endanger national security. The companies have limited options to resist those requests, such as when technology necessary for compliance isn\u2019t immediately available. Otherwise, should a company fail to cooperate immediately, the police may apply for a warrant \u201cto seize the relevant electronic device and take any action for removing that information.\u201dADAD2. What are the penalties?Non-compliance could result in a fine of HK$100,000 (around $13,000) and six months in prison for companies involved in publishing messages that are considered a threat. It\u2019s unclear exactly who at the company would be held liable. For individuals who post offending messages, the fine is the same but the jail term is one year. Separately, the rules state that for the purpose of assisting an investigation, Hong Kong\u2019s justice secretary or police may apply for a court order to require people to answer questions within a specified time period, or to furnish or produce the relevant information or material.3. How worrisome is it?ADA problem with the law is its ambiguity: It\u2019s unclear what types of actions will be considered violations. Since it took effect July 1, police for example have arrested a man for brandishing a Hong Kong independence flag and declared illegal a popular slogan chanted by pro-democracy protesters over months of rallies. For internet users, the concern is that their personal information -- including such things as their contact lists, private posts or messages -- could be shared with authorities, possibly implicating them under the law.AD4. What are the risks for Big Tech?The law presents the likes of Facebook and Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google with a stark dilemma: Bend to the law and risk becoming an accessory to a crackdown on freedoms in Hong Kong at a time when U.S.-China relations are increasingly strained, or simply refuse to comply and depart Hong Kong, much like Google did from China a decade ago for similar reasons. Some social media giants are already facing mounting criticism in their home markets for their role in hate speech and disinformation, and Facebook and others certainly won\u2019t want to expose their reputations to further harm. The law also poses a threat to tech company employees in Hong Kong and abroad, who face possible arrest and prosecution for perceived violations.AD5. Is this like the internet in China?Not really, or not yet anyway. Behind the Great Firewall, China\u2019s online population of 800 million gets a highly restricted internet, one that doesn\u2019t include access to Google, Facebook, YouTube or Western media such as the New York Times. There\u2019s little coverage of the 1989 student protests in Tiananmen Square, for example. Even Winnie the Pooh got temporarily banned when social media users compared him to President Xi Jinping. China is able to control such a vast ocean of content through the largest system of censorship in the world. It\u2019s a joint effort between government monitors and the technology and telecommunications companies compelled to enforce the state\u2019s rules. The stakes go beyond China, which is setting an example that other countries can imitate.AD6. What\u2019s the response been in Hong Kong?ADHours after Hong Kong announced the new powers, Facebook, Google, Twitter, Microsoft Corp. and Zoom Video Communications Inc. all suspended processing requests for data from the Hong Kong government while they review the law. TikTok, the viral video app from Chinese-owned ByteDance Ltd., went even further by withdrawing its service from the territory\u2019s mobile app stores \u201cin light of recent events.\u201d In the city, some people have already deleted their social media accounts. Virtual private networks, or VPNs, designed to disguise a user\u2019s digital footprints, also saw a big spike in downloads. The messaging service Signal, which deliberately collects no data on its users and encrypts their communications, became the most-downloaded app in Hong Kong after the law was imposed.7. Is Hong Kong going to lose Facebook and Google?ADMuch depends on the speed and aggressiveness with which the new law is applied. It\u2019s possible that Big Tech could decide that complying is simply not worth it in terms of political and legal risks to the company as well as to its customers and employees. If Beijing takes a slower approach to putting the law into action, U.S. firms might try to hang in there for as long as they can. \u201cWhile changes to how the internet operates in Hong Kong are likely to proceed slowly, some services could indeed be blocked at some point, particularly those that are perceived by the Chinese government to have facilitated protests,\u201d said Ian Betts, director of risk intelligence with consulting firm Hill & Associates.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P.", "comment": "0 Comments", "topic": "Business"}, {"cover": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/KOR2DHWFW4I6VD76G4V6RWBCTA.jpghttps://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/KOR2DHWFW4I6VD76G4V6RWBCTA.jpg", "title": " sanctions Lockheed Martin over Taiwan arms sales, but impact is minimal", "date": "Jul 14, 2020", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/china-sanctions-lockheed-martin-over-taiwan-arms-sales-but-impact-is-minimal/2020/07/14/3658b412-c5b7-11ea-a825-8722004e4150_story.html", "keyword": "China and Security", "website": "the Washington Post", "author": "Anna Fifield", "content": "BEIJING \u2014 China said Tuesday that it would impose unspecified sanctions on Lockheed Martin, the gargantuan American defense contractor, in retaliation for the Trump administration\u2019s decision to continue supplying arms to Taiwan.Support our journalism.

Since then, U.S. military manufacturers have been heavily constrained in what business they can do with China.Lockheed Martin does not appear to have much in the way of operations in China. The company generated 9.7 percent of its revenue in the Asia-Pacific region last year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, almost all of it with U.S. allies and partners such as Japan, South Korea and Singapore.ADADSome analysts have estimated that China represents 2 percent of the company\u2019s revenue.

Robert Menendez (D-N.J.) introduced, was passed unanimously by the Senate and the House. It required the U.S. government to compile a report about the extent of the Chinese crackdown in Xinjiang and provide potential individual targets for sanctions under the Global Magnitsky Act.More than a million people, most of them ethnic Uighurs, have been interned in huge detention camps across the northwestern region as part of a concerted effort by the officially atheist Communist Party to forcibly assimilate the mostly Muslim ethnic minorities into the majority Han culture.ADADThe Communist Party says the measures are needed to \u201cderadicalize\u201d people, but the United Nations and many Western nations have condemned the campaign as a gross violation of human rights.The Associated Press reported this month on draconian measures the Chinese government is taking to slash birthrates among Uighurs and other minorities, part of a drive to curb China\u2019s Muslim population.

But there\u2019s an opportunity here to do much\u00a0more. For\u00a0India to industrialize, rethinking\u00a0the housing situation will be as important as freeing the urban poor from\u00a0large medical bills and helping them build\u00a0retirement savings. If the country of 1.3 billion people\u00a0wants to be a factory to the world \u2014\u00a0the next China \u2014\u00a0it must start by\u00a0giving\u00a0workers low-cost\u00a0living quarters.ADADIndia is sitting on an inventory of more than 1.3 million unsold homes.\u00a0Mumbai-based property researcher Liases Foras\u00a0estimates that roughly half of these units could face delays and other execution risk; prices on nearly\u00a0nine out of 10 apartments may have to be cut\u00a0by\u00a05% to 15% to hook wary buyers. That\u2019s billions of dollars in lost revenue.It may not be possible to repurpose this stock\u00a0as worker accommodation. Nevertheless,\u00a0as losses on pricey condominiums\u00a0crystallize for struggling developers and\u00a0stretched\u00a0financiers, they can be made more bearable by\u00a0tax breaks, cheap government land and other fiscal support for\u00a0affordable rental housing \u2014 a new revenue stream. Assured\u00a0of a decent rental yield, investors will\u00a0be encouraged to finance\u00a0this new asset class. Institutional\u00a0capital will return to\u00a0depressed\u00a0real estate. Construction\u00a0will\u00a0absorb\u00a0surplus manpower and create\u00a0badly needed\u00a0wage income.\u00a0Cheap urban rents will bring India the\u00a0full benefit of labor mobility, which\u00a0isn\u2019t constrained by Chinese-style hukou, or city\u00a0registration requirements. Yet\u00a0the rapid\u00a0urbanization that turned\u00a0East Asia into an exporting\u00a0powerhouse and created a foundation\u00a0for mass\u00a0consumption\u00a0has eluded the country.\u00a0Young men migrate to cities for economic reasons, and return to their villages\u00a0in old age. Apart from cultural factors, availability and cost of housing is the\u00a0main\u00a0reason why women and children stay behind, making urbanization in India\u00a0both slow and rather \u201cmasculine,\u201d\u00a0as economist Chinmay\u00a0Tumbe, who has studied migration trends\u00a0since the 1870s, has put\u00a0it.ADADWhile the gender ratio of large cities is\u00a0no longer as skewed\u00a0as it was in the early 20th century \u2014\u00a0500 to 600\u00a0women for 1,000 men \u2014\u00a0it\u2019s\u00a0still a lopsided 868 in Delhi. For Surat, a major diamond-cutting\u00a0and textile center\u00a0on India\u2019s western coast, the ratio is even more unbalanced\u00a0at 756.\u00a0Surat is still an exception in that it has a lot of manufacturing. A peculiar facet of rural-urban migration in India, according to Tumbe, is that most of the workers end up in service-industry jobs.\u00a0Creaky infrastructure, infuriating red tape, occasionally overvalued currency\u00a0and lack of meaningful free-trade arrangements have held back\u00a0the share of manufacturing in the economy to\u00a016% \u2014 a modest rise from\u00a05% in 1901. Back then, British colonialists had kept India\u00a0under-industrialized so\u00a0they\u00a0could sell their wares in\u00a0a market that produced little of its own. Now, it\u2019s a small urban elite \u2014 whose own ancestors left\u00a0villages a long time ago \u2014\u00a0that\u2019s\u00a0keeping\u00a0new migrants employed as\u00a0chauffeurs,\u00a0housemaids, condominium security and ATM guards.The economy\u00a0is geared to satisfy the top\u00a0150 million earners,\u00a0as\u00a0Rathin Roy, until recently the director at the New Delhi-based National Institute of Public Finance and Policy, has\u00a0argued. This depresses the\u00a0wages\u00a0that would be generated by becoming good at making\u00a0what\u00a0the next 300 million want. In the absence of broad-based\u00a0income growth,\u00a0consumers\u00a0boosted spending\u00a0by borrowing. When\u00a0they eventually started to deleverage\u00a0last year, India\u00a0faced an acute demand funk,\u00a0even for  7-cent munchies.ADADSince then, Covid-19 hasn\u2019t been\u00a0the only wake-up call.\u00a0Rapidly deteriorating\u00a0U.S.-China relations portend\u00a0sweeping changes in global supply chains, but even in its own neighborhood, India isn\u2019t\u00a0competitive in\u00a0manufacturing. A\u00a0once-in-a-generation opportunity could slip out of its grasp.\u00a0At a furniture\u00a0store in Ho Chi Minh City\u00a0some years ago, I saw\u00a0colorful\u00a0satin-upholstered\u00a0sofas\u00a0whose\u00a0sides were drab\u00a0black polyester.\u00a0This, I was told,\u00a0was because the sides would take\u00a0dirt from\u00a0motorbike tires and must be easy\u00a0to\u00a0clean: A\u00a0Vietnamese\u00a0family would park the two-wheeler, its most precious possession,\u00a0next to the\u00a0living-room furniture\u00a0to keep it safe at night. Societies\u00a0that value and make things that workers themselves use lift\u00a0living standards and labor productivity.

But it's unclear how such a blunt method would be implemented under U.S. law, and such a move would likely raise censorship concerns and First Amendment challenges.Yet experts tell me the administration has a variety of tools at its disposal that could spell trouble for Generation Z\u2019s favorite social network, which is owned by China's ByteDance. And the White House has shown its willing to impose tough measures to limit other Chinese companies it views as a security threat, including Huawei.

Navarro said to expect \u201cstrong action\u201d against TikTok, as he called the company's new American chief executive Kevin Mayer a \u201cpuppet.\u201d He accused TikTok without evidence of sharing Americans\u2019 data with the Chinese Communist Party.\u00a0\u201cWhat the American people have to understand is all of the data that goes into those mobile apps that kids have so much fun with and seem so convenient, it goes right to servers in China, right to the Chinese military, the Chinese Communist Party, and the agencies which want to steal our intellectual property,\u201d Navarro said.ADTrump suggested in an interview last week that a TikTok ban is one of many options he's considering to punish China for its handling of the coronavirus. A senior administration official said the administration\u2019s concerns also include \u201cwell-documented censorship within Chinese-owned apps.\u201d\u00a0ADYet TikTok insists it has never shared user data with the Chinese government and wouldn\u2019t do so if asked.\u00a0\u201cProtecting the privacy of our users\u2019 data is a critical priority for TikTok,\u201d TikTok spokeswoman Ashley Nash-Hahn said in a statement. \u201cUser data is stored in the U.S. and Singapore, with minimal access across regions, and our American Chief Information Security Officer has decades of U.S. law enforcement and security experience.\u201d\u00a0ADThe Trump administration's rhetoric signals some action could be coming. Here's what experts say to watch:\u00a0Trump could target TikTok through a 2019 executive order aimed at Chinese companies. \u00a0\u00a0That order empowers the Commerce secretary to effectively ban any communications tool that is a national security threat to the United States by strictly applying the International Economic Emergency Powers Act. Once the government made a finding TikTok posed a national security threat under that law, Stewart Baker, who previously served as general counsel of the National Security Agency, \u00a0Americans would effectively be banned from doing business with the company.\u00a0ADAD\u201cAmericans can't work for it, Americans can't advertise on it, Americans can't put it in their app store,\u201d Baker said. \u201cYou can't give them a nickel or take a nickel.\u201dBaker said teenagers who already downloaded the app could continue using it. \u201cBut it wouldn\u2019t be maintained, there wouldn\u2019t be ads, there would be no American staff working for the company,\u201d he said. \u00a0Baker currently works for law firm Steptoe & Johnson, which counts TikTok rival Facebook as a client.\u00a0Baker added he was unaware of a time where this executive order has previously been used.\u00a0The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States could force changes at the company.\u00a0ADThe cross-government group that reviews foreign transactions involving American firms last year opened an investigation into the 2017 deal in which the Beijing-based ByteDance bought a popular karaoke app, Musical.ly, for up to $1 billion, my colleagues Drew Harwell and \u00a0Tony Romm reported. \u00a0Such a review can result in retroactively terminating deals, fines or corporate changes.ADThere is precedent for the U.S. government quashing deals involving social apps they say pose national security threats. Last year the U.S. government demanded the Chinese owners of Grindr,\u00a0 the gay dating app, give up their control of the company. They could push for a similar outcome with TikTok, said James Andrew Lewis, the senior vice president and director of the technology policy program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\u00a0Lewis said there may be a way to structure an agreement so that owner Bytedance maintains a stake as an investor but no operational control. \u201cAnd so that way they get the money and none of the headache,\u201d Lewis explained.ADAlready TikTok has been considering changes to its corporate structure as national security concerns mount.\u00a0\u201cAs we consider the best path forward, ByteDance is evaluating changes to the corporate structure of its TikTok business,\u201d Nash-Hahn said.\u00a0Digital rights advocates are criticizing the administration for not spelling out its plans.\u00a0The broad uncertainty about what the administration means when it says it would ban TikTok and how it would carry out such an order is vexing advocates for a free and open Internet.\u00a0AD\u201cThere is a point where it is just it ultimately is the responsibility of the government who is saying they're going to do a ban to explain what that ban is, what are the authorities that support that ban, how is it lawful and constitutional,\u201d said Kurt Opsahl, deputy executive director and general counsel at the Electronic Frontier Foundation. \u201cI think that would be something they really should do when they first mentioned a ban to avoid a little bit of this time period where they talk about something and then it's unclear what they mean by it. \u201dADUpdate: This article was updated to include Baker's current position with Steptoe & Johnson.\u00a0Our top tabsTech giants backed a lawsuit against a Trump administration rule that could force out international students.\u00a0Facebook, Google and Microsoft joined a brief filed by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce on Monday in support of a lawsuit brought against Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Ashley Gold reported for Axios. \u00a0ADThe tech companies are asking a federal judge to halt or slow the enforcement of the new guidance to prevent foreign students from staying in the United States if their academic institutions don\u2019t offer in-person classes.

But it's unclear how such a blunt method would be implemented under U.S. law, and such a move would likely raise censorship concerns and First Amendment challenges.Yet experts tell me the administration has a variety of tools at its disposal that could spell trouble for Generation Z\u2019s favorite social network, which is owned by China's ByteDance. And the White House has shown its willing to impose tough measures to limit other Chinese companies it views as a security threat, including Huawei. Trump's options range from leveraging a recent executive order expanding government\u2019s powers to protect communications networks to exerting pressure through a powerful national security review agency, experts tell me.\u00a0TikTok is now solidly at the center of the Trump administration\u2019s anti-China push.\u00a0The app known for viral dance videos has become a flash point as Trump ramps up his rhetoric against Beijing\u2019s handling of the coronavirus pandemic as the number of U.S. infections climbs. The attacks on TikTok could escalate as Election Day approaches and the president makes that criticism central to his reelection pitch.\u00a0ADAD\u201cJobs and China, that\u2019s what this campaign is about,\u201d White House trade adviser Peter Navarro said on Fox News Sunday.Trump officials are signaling a move is coming. Navarro said to expect \u201cstrong action\u201d against TikTok, as he called the company's new American chief executive Kevin Mayer a \u201cpuppet.\u201d He accused TikTok without evidence of sharing Americans\u2019 data with the Chinese Communist Party.\u00a0\u201cWhat the American people have to understand is all of the data that goes into those mobile apps that kids have so much fun with and seem so convenient, it goes right to servers in China, right to the Chinese military, the Chinese Communist Party, and the agencies which want to steal our intellectual property,\u201d Navarro said.ADTrump suggested in an interview last week that a TikTok ban is one of many options he's considering to punish China for its handling of the coronavirus. A senior administration official said the administration\u2019s concerns also include \u201cwell-documented censorship within Chinese-owned apps.\u201d\u00a0ADYet TikTok insists it has never shared user data with the Chinese government and wouldn\u2019t do so if asked.\u00a0\u201cProtecting the privacy of our users\u2019 data is a critical priority for TikTok,\u201d TikTok spokeswoman Ashley Nash-Hahn said in a statement. \u201cUser data is stored in the U.S. and Singapore, with minimal access across regions, and our American Chief Information Security Officer has decades of U.S. law enforcement and security experience.\u201d\u00a0ADThe Trump administration's rhetoric signals some action could be coming. Here's what experts say to watch:\u00a0Trump could target TikTok through a 2019 executive order aimed at Chinese companies. \u00a0\u00a0That order empowers the Commerce secretary to effectively ban any communications tool that is a national security threat to the United States by strictly applying the International Economic Emergency Powers Act. Once the government made a finding TikTok posed a national security threat under that law, Stewart Baker, who previously served as general counsel of the National Security Agency, \u00a0Americans would effectively be banned from doing business with the company.\u00a0ADAD\u201cAmericans can't work for it, Americans can't advertise on it, Americans can't put it in their app store,\u201d Baker said. \u201cYou can't give them a nickel or take a nickel.\u201dBaker said teenagers who already downloaded the app could continue using it. \u201cBut it wouldn\u2019t be maintained, there wouldn\u2019t be ads, there would be no American staff working for the company,\u201d he said. \u00a0Baker currently works for law firm Steptoe & Johnson, which counts TikTok rival Facebook as a client.\u00a0Baker added he was unaware of a time where this executive order has previously been used.\u00a0The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States could force changes at the company.\u00a0ADThe cross-government group that reviews foreign transactions involving American firms last year opened an investigation into the 2017 deal in which the Beijing-based ByteDance bought a popular karaoke app, Musical.ly, for up to $1 billion, my colleagues Drew Harwell and \u00a0Tony Romm reported. \u00a0Such a review can result in retroactively terminating deals, fines or corporate changes.ADThere is precedent for the U.S. government quashing deals involving social apps they say pose national security threats. Last year the U.S. government demanded the Chinese owners of Grindr,\u00a0 the gay dating app, give up their control of the company. They could push for a similar outcome with TikTok, said James Andrew Lewis, the senior vice president and director of the technology policy program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\u00a0Lewis said there may be a way to structure an agreement so that owner Bytedance maintains a stake as an investor but no operational control. \u201cAnd so that way they get the money and none of the headache,\u201d Lewis explained.ADAlready TikTok has been considering changes to its corporate structure as national security concerns mount.\u00a0\u201cAs we consider the best path forward, ByteDance is evaluating changes to the corporate structure of its TikTok business,\u201d Nash-Hahn said.\u00a0Digital rights advocates are criticizing the administration for not spelling out its plans.\u00a0The broad uncertainty about what the administration means when it says it would ban TikTok and how it would carry out such an order is vexing advocates for a free and open Internet.\u00a0AD\u201cThere is a point where it is just it ultimately is the responsibility of the government who is saying they're going to do a ban to explain what that ban is, what are the authorities that support that ban, how is it lawful and constitutional,\u201d said Kurt Opsahl, deputy executive director and general counsel at the Electronic Frontier Foundation. \u201cI think that would be something they really should do when they first mentioned a ban to avoid a little bit of this time period where they talk about something and then it's unclear what they mean by it. \u201dADUpdate: This article was updated to include Baker's current position with Steptoe & Johnson.\u00a0Our top tabsTech giants backed a lawsuit against a Trump administration rule that could force out international students.\u00a0Facebook, Google and Microsoft joined a brief filed by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce on Monday in support of a lawsuit brought against Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Ashley Gold reported for Axios. \u00a0ADThe tech companies are asking a federal judge to halt or slow the enforcement of the new guidance to prevent foreign students from staying in the United States if their academic institutions don\u2019t offer in-person classes. The parties argue the administration failed to properly consider the consequences of the move on the U.S. business community.\u00a0AD\u201cThese students contribute substantially to the U.S. economy when they are resident in the United States,\u201d the brief states. \u201cAnd without international students, American educational institutions face a sudden loss of critical mass \u2014 jeopardizing their ability to maintain their standards of excellence; produce research that helps keep U.S. businesses on the cutting edge of innovation; and provide the training that makes American students a strong talent pool for their future employers.\u201d\u00a0The 19 tech companies and trade associations backing the brief also include Spotify, Twitter, Salesforce and Dropbox. More than 200 colleges and universities are also backing the suit.The U.K. government will bar telecom companies from purchasing equipment made by Huawei.\u00a0The government will give the companies until 2027 to remove the Chinese company's technology from their 5G networks, the Wall Street Journal's Stephen Fidler and Max Colchester report.

The former is locked in a bitter, damaging trade war with the United States; the latter has seen its country\u2019s economy mauled by sanctions reimposed by the Trump administration after it broke from the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and world powers. But the tariffs and sanctions have yet to yield President Trump the acquiescence from both parties he seeks. And recent developments suggest these two putative American adversaries may be finding greater common cause.Support our journalism. Subscribe today.arrow-rightLast week, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif acknowledged in a parliamentary session that his government is, \u201cwith confidence and conviction,\u201d in negotiations with China over a 25-year strategic partnership that could involve about $400 billion in Chinese investment through various sectors of the Iranian economy. An outline of the accord\u2019s details surfaced in an 18-page leaked document online, whose provenance is unclear though it roughly aligns with mooted plans previously announced by the Iranian government. According to the New York Times, a version of the document dated in June that its reporters obtained is a draft of a pending agreement with China.ADADThe pact between the two countries would be far-reaching: It would increase intelligence sharing and security cooperation, including in possible missions in Syria and Iraq. It would also see Chinese companies expand their footprints in Iranian railroads, ports and telecommunications, while securing for Beijing a steady and discounted Iranian oil supply for the next quarter-century. China would develop free-trade zones in strategic locations in Iran, further binding the country into Beijing\u2019s sprawling Belt and Road global trade and development initiative.Even though it has been in the works since 2016, before Trump was elected, the timing of this potential agreement is conspicuous. It\u2019s a reminder of how unlikely it was that Trump could cajole Tehran to sit down for new negotiations after scrapping U.S. commitments to the nuclear deal, a diplomatic agreement that was years in the making and involved the efforts of major powers, including China. Now, with their economy in tatters, the Iranians are seeking a lifeline from Beijing. And Chinese officials, given their own tussle with Washington, seem willing to take the risk.\u201cAt a time when the United States is reeling from recession and the coronavirus, and increasingly isolated internationally, Beijing senses American weakness,\u201d wrote Times reporters Farnaz Fassihi and Steven Lee Myers. \u201cThe draft agreement with Iran shows that unlike most countries, China feels it is in a position to defy the United States, powerful enough to withstand American penalties, as it has in the trade war waged by President Trump.\u201dADADIt is unclear when an actual deal will get pushed through. When asked about it by reporters last week, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian offered a customarily anodyne response. \u201cChina and Iran enjoy traditional friendship, and the two sides have been in communication on the development of bilateral relations,\u201d he said. \u201cWe stand ready to work with Iran to steadily advance practical cooperation.\u201dChina is also playing a key role at the U.N. Security Council in blocking the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to extend an arms embargo on Iran that is set to expire later this year. Last month, China\u2019s ambassador to the United Nations, Zhang Jun, rebuffed U.S. attempts to use the terms of the nuclear deal to reimpose the weapons ban, scolding the Trump administration for not holding up its end of the bargain in the first place.Some analysts abroad saw hypocrisy in Tehran\u2019s courtship of Beijing. \u201cAn Iranian regime whose revolutionary identity is premised on countering U.S. imperialism and Islamophobia is about to ratify its total economic and strategic dependency on a Chinese government that keeps over 1 million Muslims in re-education camps,\u201d tweeted Karim Sadjadpour, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.Within Iran, the matter is hardly settled. It will require a vote in a parliament now dominated by hard-liners who are already furious with President Hassan Rouhani over both his handling of the coronavirus pandemic and the failure of the nuclear deal. Rouhani\u2019s signature diplomatic triumph has effectively turned to ash, with his country\u2019s economy asphyxiated by U.S. sanctions once more and the prospect of an opening to the West seemingly dashed.ADADBut Iran\u2019s turn toward countries like Russia and China has raised concerns about the inequitable price it may have to pay. Last month, former president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad warned in a speech of the country\u2019s current leadership discussing a monumental pact \u201caway from the eyes of the Iranian nation.\u201d Some critics, reported Radio Free Europe/Radio Free Liberty\u2019s Golnaz Esfandiari, likened the proposed deal to \u201cthe 1828 Treaty of Turkmenchay between Persia and tsarist Russia, under which the Persians ceded control of territory in the South Caucasus.\u201dZarif said there was \u201cnothing secret\u201d about the ongoing negotiations, and media outlets linked to the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps \u2014 an occasional political adversary of Rouhani and Zarif \u2014 seemed to back the diplomatic process. \u201cHowever, neither Zarif nor IRGC mouthpieces openly admitted why the Islamic Republic is compelled to orient itself toward China,\u201d wrote Ali Alfoneh, a senior fellow at the Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington. \u201cIn the face of the U.S. administration\u2019s \u2018maximum pressure\u2019 campaign, the Islamic Republic is turning toward China to secure its survival.\u201dRead more: The trouble with making Hagia Sophia a mosque againThe pandemic and the dawn of an \u2018Asian Century\u2019Trump hosts Mexico\u2019s president, an unlikely ally", "comment": "0 Comments", "topic": "Today's WorldView"}, {"cover": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/54JFAIGC64I6VNHWZM443CKA7M.jpghttps://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/54JFAIGC64I6VNHWZM443CKA7M.jpg", "title": "Humanitarian aid to Syrians threatened as Russia and  veto proposals at U.N.", "date": "Jul 10, 2020", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/humanitarian-aid-to-syrians-threatened-as-russia-and-china-veto-proposals-at-un/2020/07/10/96c87a0c-c2d4-11ea-b178-bb7b05b94af1_story.html", "keyword": "China and Security", "website": "the Washington Post", "author": "Karen DeYoungSarah Dadouch", "content": "International humanitarian assistance to millions of displaced and destitute Syrians was threatened with imminent shutdown after Russia and China on Friday vetoed a last-minute U.N.

Subscribe today.arrow-rightOne of the world\u2019s largest humanitarian operations, the cross-border shipments of food and medical supplies assist at least 3\u00a0million Syrians, the majority of them women and children. Most have fled from other parts of Syria into the country\u2019s northwest corner, the last major redoubt that has not fallen to the forces of President Bashar al-Assad, and his Russian and Iranian allies, during the nine-year civil war.The region\u2019s already dire circumstances worsened this week with confirmation of the first case of the novel coronavirus \u2014 a physician who entered Syria late last month to work in one of the remaining area hospitals.ADADAfter the 13-2 tally, the council immediately began closed-door consultations that extended into the night and appeared likely to continue early Saturday. Diplomats said that, despite the deadline, convoys that pass continuously across the Turkish border would likely continue for at least a day or two as negotiations were underway. But without a council mandate and a means to safely enter Syria, the many international aid agencies that operate there under the U.N. umbrella would have few if any options. The Friday vote came after three efforts to pass competing resolutions submitted by the West and Russia failed earlier in the week.\u201cWith their reckless brinkmanship, Moscow and Beijing are gambling with millions of Syrian lives,\u201d Kelly Craft, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, said in a statement after the vote. \u201cThey have deliberately stood in the way of this council\u2019s ability to get life-saving food and medicine into Syria. This heartlessness shouldn\u2019t surprise any of us, yet I am shocked each time my colleagues from both countries choose to blithely threaten the lives of millions.\u201dSyria\u2019s Assad confronting toughest challenges of the nine-year warIn its own statement, Russia\u2019s U.N. embassy blamed the stalemate on the refusal of the United States and others to lift sanctions against Assad\u2019s government and to recognize its sovereignty by \u00adfunneling all international aid through Damascus rather than directly to Syrians in need.ADADAfter a similarly contentious debate in December, Russia agreed that U.N. agencies could use two of what had been four border crossings.In the intervening months, conditions in the northwest have worsened, as Russian and Syrian aircraft bombarded the area, including hospitals, other medical facilities and schools. Large numbers of civilians, many of them already displaced by conflict elsewhere in the country, fled toward the closed Turkish border.Moscow and Damascus maintained that the attacks were against terrorist groups that have come to dominate the remaining Syrian opposition forces in the region. They include Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, the leading Islamist militant organization, designated a terrorist group by the United States and the United Nations.ADIn the wake of the bombardments, a newly released U.N. report said that HTS \u201cindiscriminately shelled densely populated civilian areas,\u201d pillaged civilian homes and \u201cdetained, tortured, and executed civilians expressing dissenting opinions. .\u2009.\u2009.AD\u201cWhat is clear from the military campaign is that pro-government forces and UN-designated terrorists flagrantly violated the laws of war and the rights of Syrian civilians,\u201d the report said.The United Nations provides coordination and logistics for the large-scale aid operation, with a wide range of governments and nongovernmental organizations providing money and supplies.As debate over the expiring aid resolution began early this month, Russia \u2014 backed by China \u2014 insisted that the aid crossings were no longer needed and that Damascus should be recognized as the legitimate recipient of humanitarian aid. The United States and others accuse the Assad government of siphoning off the majority of assistance it has received and have said they will provide it with no aid until it agrees to a U.N.-mandated political resolution to the war.ADADBargaining began with the introduction of a German-Belgian resolution that would allow both existing border crossings to remain open for the next 12 months. All but Russia and China voted for it.That was followed by a Russian proposal calling for one of the two crossings to remain open for six months, and agreement for the U.N. secretary general to report on the economic effect of sanctions on Syria. It received only four of the council\u2019s 15 votes, with Vietnam and South Africa joining Russia and China.Germany and Belgium countered with a new resolution, for two crossings for six months. Russia offered an amendment \u2014 one crossing for six months. The amendment was defeated, with support only from Moscow and Beijing. Vietnam and South Africa abstained.ADFriday\u2019s failed vote was on the last German-Belgian proposal.ADInternational aid agencies bemoaned the failure and warned of catastrophe with the appearance of the coronavirus, from which the region had largely been spared. Even if agreement is eventually reached to leave one crossing open, \u201cit will not be possible to scale up the covid-19 response,\u201d said Tue Jakobsen, who manages humanitarian operations in the region for CARE.Mustafa al-Eudo, deputy director of the Idlib Health Directorate, said the community there has been working for months to raise awareness and gather supplies for the possible arrival of the pandemic.So far, they have set up three hospitals and four isolation areas for the virus that \u201cwill help us in the first stage, to a certain extent,\u201d he said.

Subscribe today.arrow-rightThis enthusiasm has propelled a fast and furious surge in stocks. The tech-heavy ChiNext Index is up 46% this year, and sports an eye-popping valuation of 35 times 2021 earnings. That\u2019s\u00a0above the Nasdaq Composite Index\u2019s 27.5 times, which is already expensive and reason enough for the rally to fade.Investors are smart to play\u00a0in fields where the fiscal dollars are. But it\u2019s also a dangerous game. What\u2019s recurring income and what counts as extraordinary items? Once we remove government subsidies, the valuations of China\u2019s tech darlings become\u00a0even airier.\u00a0ADADHelicopter money can come in many forms. First and foremost, Beijing is a large client.\u00a0Even before the coronavirus,\u00a0the government was the biggest buyer of IT security, accounting for 27% of total spending last year, according to IDC. Meanwhile, the\u00a0latest policies, which require stringent security reviews, clearly favor local providers. Investors have picked up on this theme: Shenzhen-based Sangfor Technologies Inc., with a 25% and 22% market share in China\u2019s VPN and content security segments, has soared 89% this year to $12.6\u00a0billion in market value.\u00a0There are also regular cash handouts that lubricate companies\u2019 daily operations, and money for new industrial parks. Injecting capital outright, as well as fast-tracking\u00a0public-markets financing, are also on the table. Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp., China\u2019s largest chip foundry and its best shot at catching up to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.,  checks\u00a0all of the boxes. Its Hong Kong-listed shares have risen more than 200%, amassing a market cap of\u00a0$29\u00a0billion.Without the Beijing put, though, the income statements of many tech firms\u00a0would look drastically different. At SMIC, government funding, which appears in\u00a0\u201cother operating income,\u201d\u00a0rose 87% to $293 million in 2019. A further $59 million in the first quarter exceeded the foundry\u2019s $51 million bottom-line profit; in other words, without subsidies, SMIC would be in the red \u2014\u00a0and it wouldn\u2019t even have a price-to-earnings ratio to look at.\u00a0ADADThis phenomenon is pervasive. Of the 37 listed companies classified as \u201cintegrated circuit\u201d industries, subsidies accounted for a whopping 15% of operating profit last year, on a market-cap weighted basis, Bloomberg Opinion analysis shows.The stand-outs are memory-chip maker Gigadevice Semiconductor (Beijing)\u00a0Inc.\u00a0and Unigroup Guoxin Microelectronics Co., which designs chips used in smart cards. A similar picture emerges for software companies, such as Yonyou Network Technology Co., which aims\u00a0to become China\u2019s Salesforce.com\u00a0Inc., and Sangfor. All these stocks are big winners this year.\u00a0While it\u2019s great Beijing is tending its tech gardens right now, the question is whether and when it will pull the plug. Over the years, China\u2019s electric vehicle sector has had an  on-again, off-again relationship with subsidies, creating turbulence in stocks, as my colleague Anjani Trivedi has written. Will the government get tired of paying for an expensive tech build-out, too?\u00a0ADADAnother aspect worth considering is that, unlike previous endeavors, this new infrastructure spree\u00a0will rely more on local governments\u00a0than\u00a0national spending. Indeed, major areas including Beijing,\u00a0Shanghai and Jiangsu province have been rolling out ambitious investment blueprints lately. But, pinched by the virus outbreak, they have no money. Their funding gap will reach as much as 11.5 trillion yuan\u00a0($1.64 trillion) this year, according to the Ministry of Finance. The southwestern city of Chongqing, for instance, saw its fiscal revenue tumble by 16.8% in the first four months this year. Still,\u00a0it  vowed to become a strategic investor in Tsinghua Unigroup Co.,\u00a0which has the very expensive goal of becoming China\u2019s Samsung Electronics Co.

You declared that China did not want to see its relationship with the United States descend into a new Cold War. You declared that China was willing to \u201cactivate and open all the channels of dialogue\u201d with the United States. You also noted that \u201cslandering others does not clear one\u2019s own name, and finger-pointing cannot resolve any problems.\u201dSupport our journalism. Subscribe today.arrow-rightI \u2014 and I\u2019m sure many other China watchers in the United States \u2014 heartily agree and, to that end, permit me a modest proposal: let\u2019s stop the war that the United States and China are engaged in over the media.ADLet\u2019s agree that tit-for-tat expulsions and other limits imposed by either side have unnecessarily reduced the numbers of American correspondents in China and Chinese correspondents in the United States. This drop could damage the ability of people in both countries, including investors, diplomats, soldiers and average citizens, to understand one another. As you noted in your speech, \u201conly communication can dispel falsehoods.\u201dADWith that in mind, Foreign Minister Wang, isn\u2019t it time for a truce?One step would be to acknowledge that while no one wants to reprise the Cold War, some of the reciprocal arrangements worked out between Moscow and Washington are worth considering. Back in the day, the United States and the Soviet Union followed a strict quota system when it came to the media. Russia could send the same number of reporters to the United States as the United States could send to Russia. So, the Soviet newspaper Pravda got two slots in the United States, for example, while the New York Times got two in the U.S.S.R.ADObviously, today the media ecosystem is bigger and more complex than the one between Russia and the United States during the Cold War. The best guess of State Department officials is that there are currently about 150 reporters from China in the United States, even after the Trump administration moved in March to limit to 100 the number of Chinese nationals who could work for five of Beijing\u2019s state-run news organizations in the United States. And there are an estimated 80 American correspondents based in China, even after China responded to the Trump administration\u2019s move by expelling every American correspondent (save one) from the China bureaus of The Post, the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal.ADThe solution could be establishing a clear-cut quota system of, say, 150 reporters on each side. That would meet the Trump administration\u2019s goal of a more reciprocal relationship with Beijing, while also aligning with China\u2019s mission of maintaining its media operations in America. On the U.S. side, a nongovernmental organization (NGO) or a separate media-related organization could dole out the slots to interested parties so that the U.S. government is not involved.Chinese authorities could allocate their quota as they see fit. Visas should be issued on at least a yearly basis, with an added proviso to permit another quota of reporters \u2014 such as magazine writers and documentary crews, \u2014 on short-term visas to operate in the countries.ADBut Foreign Minister Wang, it\u2019s still an open question whether anyone in the Chinese government is really interested in halting the media war or establishing a balanced relationship with the United States when it comes to the media. I\u2019m told that State Department officials have indicated to their Chinese counterparts that the U.S. government is interested in discussing the media issue in detail but, so far, no Chinese agency, including your ministry, appears interested in engaging.ADMany of us in the media believe that the Chinese government fears U.S. reporters because their scoops \u2014 such as those probing the wealth of high-ranking Communist Party members \u2014 have rocked the foundations of party power. Tit-for-tat expulsions means the United States loses and maybe, Minister Wang, your government is comfortable with that.However, another view notes that the Chinese government has invested billions of dollars in a so-called Grand External Propaganda Campaign, according to a report published by the Hoover Institution, which involves ramping up China Global Television, Xinhua (now the biggest news agency in the world), China Daily and other outlets. The prospect of completely losing a foothold in the United States might animate Chinese officials to consider a deal.ADUltimately, Minister Wang, the issue of media access is a trade issue. How can Chinese companies expect to tap into U.S. financial markets, for example, if they don\u2019t allow American reporters to write from China about those Chinese companies? The recent scandal involving Luckin Coffee \u2014 which raised some $645 million on Wall Street in 2019 only to implode after it disclosed that it had fabricated most of its 2019 revenue \u2014 underscores the need for on-the-ground reporting in China.ADMore broadly, why should China Global Television be allowed to reach more than 30 million households in the United States, for example, if the New York Times\u2019s website remains blocked by censors in Beijing? If Chinese state-run and private companies can invest in or subsidize media properties in the United States, as they have done, why can\u2019t U.S. firms do the same in China?At the center of all this is the word \u201creciprocity.\u201d Chinese officials have told me that they define reciprocity to mean that Chinese government media outlets should be able to benefit from the openness of the American system while their U.S. counterparts must tolerate restrictions imposed by Beijing. That\u2019s reciprocal in Beijing\u2019s view. That\u2019s a perversion of the word.ADStill, that can be discussed in depth after we\u2019ve called a truce. And to get there, a simple quota system for media access is a good start.Read more:Fareed Zakaria: China has been bungling its post-coronavirus foreign policyJosh Rogin: Trump\u2019s China hawks are loose and not wasting any timeCharles Dunst: Welcome to China\u2019s new interventionist foreign policyJohn Pomfret: The Trump administration\u2019s China policies are ironically bolstering Beijing", "comment": "0 Comments", "topic": "Global Opinions"}, {"cover": "", "title": "\u2019s Tech Rally Starts Where Nasdaq\u2019s Ended", "date": "Jul 8, 2020", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/chinas-tech-rally-starts-where-nasdaqs-ended/2020/07/08/8ec649d0-c16f-11ea-8908-68a2b9eae9e0_story.html", "keyword": "China and Security", "website": "the Washington Post", "author": "", "content": "China is nothing if not ambitious. Facing a coronavirus-battered economy, Beijing is speeding up an infrastructure build-out to stimulate growth,  vowing to spend an estimated $1.4 trillion over five years on areas such as 5G, industrial automation\u00a0and cybersecurity.Support our journalism. Subscribe today.arrow-rightThis enthusiasm has propelled a fast and furious surge in stocks. The tech-heavy ChiNext Index is up 46% this year, and sports an eye-popping valuation of 35 times 2021 earnings. That\u2019s\u00a0above the Nasdaq Composite Index\u2019s 27.5 times, which is already expensive and reason enough for the rally to fade.Investors are smart to play\u00a0in fields where the fiscal dollars are. But it\u2019s also a dangerous game. What\u2019s recurring income and what counts as extraordinary items? Once we remove government subsidies, the valuations of China\u2019s tech darlings become\u00a0even airier.\u00a0ADADHelicopter money can come in many forms. First and foremost, Beijing is a large client.\u00a0Even before the coronavirus,\u00a0the government was the biggest buyer of IT security, accounting for 27% of total spending last year, according to IDC. Meanwhile, the\u00a0latest policies, which require stringent security reviews, clearly favor local providers. Investors have picked up on this theme: Shenzhen-based Sangfor Technologies Inc., with a 25% and 22% market share in China\u2019s VPN and content security segments, has soared 89% this year to $12.6\u00a0billion in market value.\u00a0There are also regular cash handouts that lubricate companies\u2019 daily operations, and money for new industrial parks. Injecting capital outright, as well as fast-tracking\u00a0public-markets financing, are also on the table. Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp., China\u2019s largest chip foundry and its best shot at catching up to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.,  checks\u00a0all of the boxes. Its Hong Kong-listed shares have risen more than 200%, amassing a market cap of\u00a0$29\u00a0billion.Without the Beijing put, though, the income statements of many tech firms\u00a0would look drastically different. At SMIC, government funding, which appears in\u00a0\u201cother operating income,\u201d\u00a0rose 87% to $293 million in 2019. A further $59 million in the first quarter exceeded the foundry\u2019s $51 million bottom-line profit; in other words, without subsidies, SMIC would be in the red \u2014\u00a0and it wouldn\u2019t even have a price-to-earnings ratio to look at.\u00a0ADADThis phenomenon is pervasive. Of the 37 listed companies classified as \u201cintegrated circuit\u201d industries, subsidies accounted for a whopping 15% of operating profit last year, on a market-cap weighted basis, Bloomberg Opinion analysis shows.The stand-outs are memory-chip maker Gigadevice Semiconductor (Beijing)\u00a0Inc.\u00a0and Unigroup Guoxin Microelectronics Co., which designs chips used in smart cards. A similar picture emerges for software companies, such as Yonyou Network Technology Co., which aims\u00a0to become China\u2019s Salesforce.com\u00a0Inc., and Sangfor. All these stocks are big winners this year.\u00a0While it\u2019s great Beijing is tending its tech gardens right now, the question is whether and when it will pull the plug. Over the years, China\u2019s electric vehicle sector has had an  on-again, off-again relationship with subsidies, creating turbulence in stocks, as my colleague Anjani Trivedi has written. Will the government get tired of paying for an expensive tech build-out, too?\u00a0ADADAnother aspect worth considering is that, unlike previous endeavors, this new infrastructure spree\u00a0will rely more on local governments\u00a0than\u00a0national spending. Indeed, major areas including Beijing,\u00a0Shanghai and Jiangsu province have been rolling out ambitious investment blueprints lately. But, pinched by the virus outbreak, they have no money. Their funding gap will reach as much as 11.5 trillion yuan\u00a0($1.64 trillion) this year, according to the Ministry of Finance. The southwestern city of Chongqing, for instance, saw its fiscal revenue tumble by 16.8% in the first four months this year. Still,\u00a0it  vowed to become a strategic investor in Tsinghua Unigroup Co.,\u00a0which has the very expensive goal of becoming China\u2019s Samsung Electronics Co. Will Chongqing be able to deliver?\u00a0Of course, extraordinary times call for extraordinary ways to look at stocks. Right now, investors have big grins on their faces when they do a word search for mentions of \u201cgovernment\u201d in company filings. China\u2019s tech carnival can\u2019t go on forever, though.

Schools are emerging as ideological battlegrounds as officials seek to transform freethinking students into patriots loyal to the motherland through punishment, coercion, surveillance and propaganda-style education.ADAD\"I feel like we have suddenly been put on the front line,\" said Chan, whose Chinese history syllabus officials have made compulsory for the first time. \"The government seems to have found that education is easier to blame for the current situation in Hong Kong, and easier to fix.\"A culture of self-censorship and government control that was already growing in schools intensified recently as Beijing introduced a security law aimed at eliminating dissent, according to nearly a dozen teachers and students who spoke to The Washington Post. The law, published June 30, compels Hong Kong's government to \"promote national security education\" and pinpoints campuses for \"supervision and regulation.\"This week, education authorities told schools to review their library collections and remove books that could violate the law. Titles including those by democracy activist Joshua Wong have already disappeared from public libraries.With Hong Kong security law, China writes broad international powers for itselfThe security law is so feared in Hong Kong, which was rocked by anti-government protests last year, that there has been no discussion of it in classrooms or among teachers and principals, teachers say. Instead, classroom debates on political issues \u2014 common until recently \u2014 have been replaced by silence on the most consequential changes since the city's 1997 handover to China.ADADMost teachers spoke on the condition of anonymity, fearing retribution over their political views.\"It is getting to the point where we are wondering if we should quit,\" said a 50-year-old who teaches history and liberal studies, the latter of which pro-Beijing lawmakers have blamed for radicalizing students. \"What is the point of teaching if all they want us to do is manipulate, brainwash and control our kids?\"'We are fighting a war'Leading Beijing's charge is Hong Kong's Education Bureau, which has issued new directives in recent weeks.When a law criminalizing mockery of China's national anthem took effect in June, Education Secretary Kevin Yeung said Hong Kong teachers should be ready to call the police on students who disrespect the song. He told a local radio station that \"Glory to Hong Kong,\" the democracy movement's unofficial anthem, should be banned in schools because it was \"propaganda.\" Officials required schools to display the Chinese and Hong Kong flags during celebrations and play China's anthem, \"March of the Volunteers.\"ADADIn May, the bureau ordered the local examinations body to remove a question on Sino-Japanese history, saying it was biased and would hurt the feelings of Chinese people. And for the next school year, teachers will have to undergo new training on professional \"roles, values and conduct.\"\"What the government is trying to say is that there are wrong teachers, wrong materials, wrong subjects and recently there are wrong examinations, and these are the reasons why the young people have been led to a wrong path,\" said Ip Kin-yuen, who represents the education sector in Hong Kong's legislature. \"Obviously, we do not agree.\"The Education Bureau did not respond to a request for comment and declined to make the secretary available for an interview.ADTeachers say they fear the bureau because it is responsible for registering teachers, including those in private and international schools. Several said the bureau has ordered schools to take action against them even when their principal or school board has found no wrongdoing. Some, including a liberal studies teacher and artist who posts pro-democracy sketches on his personal Instagram page, have been terminated.AD\"We teachers can't do anything about that,\" said Raymond Yeung, a 30-year-old liberal studies teacher who was partially blinded in one eye when he was hit by a tear-gas canister at a protest last year. He said the elite girls school where he taught had indicated it would not extend his contract after it canceled his subject as a compulsory course for some students.\"It has come to the point in our movement that we are fighting a war, and they will use whatever method they can to suppress us,\" Yeung said.History vanishesHistorical moments and topics of discussion are disappearing from official textbooks, teachers say. In liberal studies, textbooks formerly prompted discussion on whether civil disobedience is within the rule of law, citing the examples of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and Mahatma Gandhi. This was removed, according to teachers, after Hong Kongers protested in 2014 for universal suffrage.ADADSome schools have warned teachers against discussing China's 1989 massacre of students in Tiananmen Square. The Education Bureau's teaching materials discuss the Cultural Revolution and Mao Zedong's purges of intellectuals and other anti-communist elements in one paragraph.Topics that could veer into criticism of Hong Kong leaders and institutions have also been erased. Some teachers said they are skipping topics on the role of police. At Yeung's school, discussion of Lee Tung Street \u2014 an urban-renewal project championed by Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam that turned a street of wedding-card vendors into a sanitized strip of high-end shops \u2014 was removed.\"The devil's claw is gradually stretching into education,\" said one elementary school teacher. \"They are trying to control the independent thinking of the students, to influence the way they judge right from wrong.\"Prank calls and death threatsTeachers also described instances of doxing, threats and harassment. More than 40 teachers have received official warnings from the Education Bureau for social media posts perceived to be critical of the Hong Kong police and government since late last year, according to Ip.ADADIp said teachers are self-censoring, unsure \"who is complaining and who is digging out such things, in some cases, even from their private social media pages.\"Yeung, the 30-year-old teacher, said he received death threats, prank calls and pictures of dead bodies after reports emerged that he had been injured at a protest. Recently, men have started ringing his doorbell and running away. He has installed security cameras.\"They have been very effective,\" Yeung added. \"In one year, they've been able to scare so many teachers, and so many of us have been affected, but most are too afraid to speak up.\"Countries prepare to take in Hong Kong refugees fleeing China\u2019s crackdownA 24-year-old high school mathematics teacher, who was arrested and charged last July for nonviolent offenses related to the protests, said the Education Bureau sent letters to her principal asking whether the school had considered suspending her.ADADThe principal allowed her to continue. But after the teacher's personal information was posted on a doxing website, she received late-night calls from strangers who accused her of prostitution and of having sex with protesters. One person mailed a letter to her home containing nude photos, falsely claiming that they were of her students and that she had encouraged the behavior.She, too, has installed security cameras.Some educators have found ways to push back. One elementary school teacher, unsatisfied with class materials that used Mandarin and the simplified Chinese characters used in mainland China, created videos in Cantonese with subtitles in traditional characters used in Hong Kong. Others are writing textbooks or creating support groups with pro-democracy parents so they can teach children privately about events such as Tiananmen.\"You can try to stop students from singing songs and waving flags,\" said the 50-year-old history and liberal studies teacher, \"but at the end of the day, you can't control their minds.\"\n\nTiffany Liang contributed to this report.China enacts Hong Kong security law, escalating confrontation with U.S.U.S. blocks visas for Chinese officials responsible for \u2018eviscerating\u2019 Hong Kong freedomsHong Kong families, fearing a reign of terror, prepare to flee the city", "comment": "102 Comments", "topic": "Asia & Pacific"}, {"cover": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/VFQEN7F7U4I6VNHWZM443CKA7M.jpghttps://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/VFQEN7F7U4I6VNHWZM443CKA7M.jpg", "title": "Britain may further limit Huawei in 5G, a win for Washington and blow to ", "date": "Jul 6, 2020", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/huawei-5g-uk/2020/07/06/7477b862-bf8e-11ea-8908-68a2b9eae9e0_story.html", "keyword": "China and Security", "website": "the Washington Post", "author": "William Booth", "content": "LONDON \u2014 Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Monday signaled that his government may be shifting its stance on Huawei and moving to further limit the Chinese telecom giant's role in building Britain's fifth generation mobile phone network.Support our journalism.

The two countries have already been clashing over Beijing\u2019s \u00adcrackdown on political freedoms and a strict new security law for Hong Kong.ADSpeaking at a virtual news conference in London on Monday, China\u2019s ambassador to Britain, Liu Xiaoming, told Johnson, \u201cYou cannot have a golden era if you treat China as an enemy.\u201dIn January, Britain decided to limit Huawei\u2019s market share for the country\u2019s \u201cnoncore\u201d 5G network to 35\u00a0percent, while labeling the company a \u201chigh risk vendor\u201d and barring use of its equipment in \u201ccore\u201d parts of the network, including intelligence, military and nuclear sites.ADThe decision was far short of what Washington had been pushing for, as it battles China for dominance over 5G, but Britain noted there are few other providers of the tech that can match the Chinese price.Six months later, the calculations may  shift.On Saturday, the Telegraph newspaper \u2014 which has strong links to Johnson\u2019s Conservative Party \u2014 wrote that an upcoming report from Britain\u2019s National Cyber Security Center concluded the U.S. sanctions announced in May, which bar Huawei from using technology relying on American intellectual property, could undermine British confidence it its ability to oversee Huawei.ADThe Guardian subsequently reported that British officials were discussing proposals to stop installing new Huawei equipment in the 5G network in as little as six months, and to speed up the removal of technology that is already in place.ADIn his remarks Monday, the Chinese ambassador to Britain taunted Johnson\u2019s government for entertaining the Trump administration\u2019s arguments on Huawei.\u201cIt means you succumb to foreign pressure and you cannot make your own independent foreign policy,\u201d Liu said. \u201cI always say Britain can only be great when it can have its independent foreign policy.\u201dLiu warned, \u201cIf the U.K. chooses to pay a high price for poorer quality, or less quality, it is up to you.

China fears this could undercut Hong Kong\u2019s position as a global financial hub and lead to a brain drain.While tensions with China are high throughout much of Europe, Germany and France have not deviated from their plans to include Huawei in their 5G networks.ADIn June, German telecommunications company Deutsche Telekom announced it was making 5G available to millions of people in the country in cooperation with Huawei, but it added that it excludes Huawei technology from its most critical networks. Several other German telecommunications providers had previously also said they would cooperate with Huawei on their 5G plans, even though some members of Germany\u2019s coalition government remain critical of or outright opposed to Chinese involvement.ADFrench authorities have taken a middle path, urging operators who do not use Huawei not to and issuing time-limited certifications for those who already do to continue their contracts with the firm.\u201cWhat I can say is that there will not be a total ban,\u201d Guillaume Poupard, the director general of France\u2019s National Information Systems Security Agency, told France\u2019s Les Echos newspaper.ADPoupard added that telecom companies that already use Huawei would be allowed to continue doing so for periods that would vary between three and eight years.French firms such as SFR and Bouygues Telecom already use Huawei and are keen to rely on it as they move into 5G, and they have told French authorities they expect compensation if the government ultimately prohibits them from doing so.\n\nJames McAuley in Paris and Rick Noack in Berlin contributed to this report.", "comment": "51 Comments", "topic": "Europe"}, {"cover": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://d1i4t8bqe7zgj6.cloudfront.net/07-08-2020/t_2040c9d1030e45658743ba0dc5a0662c_name_20200708_hongkong_whynow_thumb_scaled.jpghttps://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://d1i4t8bqe7zgj6.cloudfront.net/07-08-2020/t_2040c9d1030e45658743ba0dc5a0662c_name_20200708_hongkong_whynow_thumb_scaled.jpg", "title": "Why  chose now to crack down on Hong Kong", "date": "Jul 8, 2020", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/why-china-chose-now-to-crack-down-on-hong-kong/2020/07/08/5222d6c7-0823-407c-b48d-23ca191c2a02_video.html", "keyword": "China and Security", "website": "the Washington Post", "author": "", "content": "", "comment": "", "topic": ""}, {"cover": "", "title": "Dear , Enjoy This Bull Market.

The theme? Self-reliance.Support our journalism. Subscribe today.arrow-rightTwo years ago, when the trade war first hit, China\u2019s $8.5 trillion stock market sank into one of its deepest bear episodes, as worries\u00a0about the economic damage of decoupling took root. This time, tension with the U.S. hasn\u2019t even made a dent. Rather, mainland\u00a0shares are on fire. The benchmark CSI 300 Index has rallied 14% this year, to trade at a five-year high. The S&P 500 Index, by comparison, is still in the red. Daily trading volume has exceeded 1 trillion yuan ($142\u00a0billion) for three consecutive trading days.\u00a0The latest frenzy began right after Beijing imposed its national security law on Hong Kong, despite U.S. opposition. Now,\u00a0 investors\u00a0have renewed their faith that China is finally recognizing the importance of self-sufficiency. Bullish sell-side analysts are tossing around buzz words like national champions, import substitutes\u00a0and capital market reforms; ultimately, these\u00a0boil down the idea that turning inward\u00a0is good for stocks.\u00a0ADADThere are many examples. Consider Shanghai-based Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp., a chip foundry that counts Huawei Technologies Co. as its largest client. Rather than languishing as  Huawei gets boxed out of U.S. technology, SMIC\u2019s Hong Kong-listed shares are up over 200% this year.On the financing front, SMIC is  behaving every bit like a national champion already. On May 15, the day Huawei got slapped with further sanctions, the state-owned China Integrated Circuit Industry Investment Fund, which held close to 20% of SMIC as of December 2019, said it would co-invest about $2.5 billion into one of its wafer plants. Meanwhile, securities regulators have fast-tracked the company\u2019s plans\u00a0to raise as much as $7.5 billion in Shanghai, the  largest mainland initial public offering\u00a0in a decade. Beijing is well aware that chip manufacturing is a capital-intensive business, and it must provide financial support as SMIC races to catch up on technology.\u00a0In the industrial space, global supply-chain disruption\u00a0is already benefiting Chinese players. For instance, Sany Heavy Industry Co., China\u2019s largest excavator maker, has seen its domestic market share jump to 27% from 8% in 2010, at the expense of foreign brands, data provided by HSBC Holdings Plc show. No surprise, Sany\u2019s stock is up 24% this year, while Caterpillar Inc., whose mainland market share shrank to 11% from\u00a014% in 2016, is down 13.5%. Jiangsu Hengli Hydraulic Co., a large manufacturer, tells a similar story. It\u2019s up\u00a055% this year.\u00a0ADADWashington\u2019s\u00a0 attempt to block mainland businesses\u2019 access to U.S. money\u00a0\u2014 from the delisting of Chinese American depositary receipts in New York, to\u00a0forbidding federal pension funds from investing in mainland companies \u2014 is only forcing Beijing to speed up its capital markets reform. Regulators are already\u00a0rewriting  equity financing rules, including\u00a0the launch of new registration-based IPOs,\u00a0and opening new funding venues for young startups. As a result, we can expect China\u2019s stock market to grow to 100% of its gross domestic product in the next five to 10 years, from 60% now, estimates CICC Research.When it comes to stock investing, China and the U.S. face the same set of problems. A slowing economy inevitably eats into corporate earnings growth, narrowing any justification for a further bull run.But President Donald Trump is giving China\u2019s stock market a second wind. Huawei may prefer chips made by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.\u00a0\u2014 after the U.S. sanctions, though, it may have no choice but hold its nose and buy domestic. Meanwhile, industry consolidation, which benefits domestic firms, is only accelerating now that Beijing is openly supporting its national champions. Trump is always looking at the stock market for validation. This time, he\u2019s looking at the wrong one.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Shuli Ren is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering Asian markets.

He rose through party ranks on the strength of his work suppressing grass-roots protests and spent years as an official propagandist.Countries prepare to take in Hong Kong refugees fleeing China\u2019s crackdownBeijing\u2019s moves in Hong Kong have drawn condemnation from Western nations, with the United States announcing that it would impose sanctions on Chinese officials responsible for the policies. Several governments have announced plans to accept Hong Kongers as refugees, including the United States, Britain, Australia and Taiwan.ADNathan Law, a prominent Hong Kong democracy activist who addressed a House Foreign Affairs Committee hearing this week, announced Thursday that he had fled the city for an undisclosed location.The appointment of Zheng just days after the law\u2019s passage reflects Beijing\u2019s resolve to implement the legislation swiftly despite the backlash.Zheng notably oversaw the Guangdong village of Wukan during its 2011 uprising. After months of clashes over an illegal land grab, villagers forced local officials and police out of Wukan, leading to police putting the village under siege.ADAs part of the truce to end the standoff, Wukan was allowed an unusual experiment in democracy, with residents allowed to elect a new committee of village representatives.Zheng\u2019s disdain for foreign media made headlines during the crisis, with a leaked video showing him saying in a meeting: \u201cForeign media can be trusted when pigs can climb trees.\u201dWith Hong Kong security law, China writes broad international powers for itselfHis appointment to the new Office for Safeguarding National Security suggested that Hong Kong security issues may have been managed from Guangdong in recent years, Sebastian Veg, a Paris-based professor of modern Chinese history at the School for Advanced Studies in Social Sciences, said on Twitter. Hong Kong\u2019s mini-constitution stipulates that the city should run its own affairs, apart from defense and foreign relations.ADADWhile Hong Kong and Guangdong province share cultural history, including the Cantonese language and historic trading links, their residents have long had testy relations with each other because of diverging politics.As anti-Beijing protests intensified last year in Hong Kong, Guangdong officials sought to ease tensions by pledging to increase investment in Hong Kong and provide jobs for the city\u2019s youth.But Guangdong also played a major role in Beijing\u2019s intimidation tactics against Hong Kong protesters last year. After Hong Kong police failed to quell sometimes-violent demonstrations week after week, mainland police and soldiers began performing anti-riot drills across the border in Shenzhen, a Guangdong metropolis.ADSimon Cheng, an employee of the British Consulate in Hong Kong, claimed last fall that he was abducted and tortured in Shenzhen for two weeks, as authorities interrogated him on whether the British government had contributed to fomenting the protests in Hong Kong. He announced on Twitter this week that he had been granted asylum in Britain.ADAlong with Zheng, two deputies were also announced Friday for the new security agency in Hong Kong. One, Li Jiangzhou, was already China\u2019s top public security ministry official stationed to Hong Kong. There is little public information available about the second deputy, Sun Qingye, though the state-run tabloid Global Times reported Friday that she was an official at the Ministry of State Security, Beijing\u2019s main intelligence agency.China enacts Hong Kong security law, escalating confrontation with U.S.Meanwhile, authorities signaled that they would wield the new restrictions on speech broadly.ADLate Thursday, Hong Kong\u2019s government said a protest slogan \u2014 \u201cLiberate Hong Kong, revolution of our times\u201d \u2014 would be illegal as it promoted Hong Kong independence and therefore constituted subversion, punishable by life imprisonment. The phrase is a mantra of the pro-democracy movement, etched on flags, walls and T-shirts.ADOn Friday, a 24-year-old motorcyclist became the first to be charged under the new law, after driving into riot police during a protest Wednesday while carrying a black \u201cLiberate Hong Kong\u201d flag. A video of the incident shows the rider falling off before he was surrounded and apprehended. He was charged with incitement to secession and terrorism.Earlier this week, Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam told the U.N.

Others are offering advice for how to prevail: enlist India as an ally, say, or perhaps befriend Russia. While China\u2019s foreign minister is warning that the United States is pushing \u201cto the brink of a new Cold War,\u201d a former Trump official has already announced \u201cthe start of a new Cold War.\u201dADADIt may be tempting to reach for the Cold War playbook. Two superpowers now stand off in geopolitical, military and ideological competition. They compete for allies and influence across multiple regions. Both wish to avoid the profound destructiveness of hot war, but neither is willing to acquiesce in the other\u2019s preferences. Competition stretches across multiple domains, simultaneously and indefinitely. This all sounds familiar.But looking backward to the Cold War obscures more than it illuminates about U.S.-China competition today. The Soviet Union and the West formed coherent blocs \u2014 in Europe, for instance, NATO stood on one side and the Warsaw Pact on the other. Nonaligned countries in key strategic regions were relatively few and far between. The name of the game was to contain the other\u2019s expansion while finding new allies where one could. Contested spaces saw proxy wars and battles for alignment, and little economic activity took place between blocs.Virtually none of these characteristics are present in today\u2019s world. China lacks anything representing an Eastern Bloc, and the United States\u2019 network of alliances is military but not economic; indeed, one of America\u2019s top trade partners is its greatest geopolitical rival. U.S. allies aren\u2019t ready to sign up for an all-out confrontation with Beijing, and nearly everyone wants some mixture of security and economic benefits from both the United States and China.ADADRather than a replay of the Cold War, a new kind of competition is emerging \u2014 one that eludes neat concepts such as containment and engagement that defined America\u2019s previous approach to great-power politics.As a result, cookie-cutter Cold War policies \u2014 such as a counter-China military alliance, a geographic containment strategy or all-out economic warfare \u2014 are as ill-suited as they are unlikely to succeed. Nor is the answer to fan fears of a looming Cold War and urge Washington to ease up on competition with China. Beijing\u2019s ambitions are increasingly global and at odds with the United States, and Washington needs an approach that factors in this new reality.That means preparing for a more differentiated competition with Beijing, one in which rivalry plays out issue by issue and countries balance an array of relationships with both capitals. Out with unified blocs, uncoupled economies and Fulda Gap-like standoffs; in with multiple strategies aimed at decreasing interdependence and competing effectively where necessary, and conserving energy and resources where not.ADADFrustrating even America\u2019s best grand strategists, the right approach for the United States will vary. Some issues will be containment-like: trying to stymie the export of China\u2019s high-tech authoritarianism, for instance. Some will be more defensive, primarily aiming to prevent China\u2019s dominance, as in the South China Sea.Others will require focusing on U.S. power at home separate and apart from China, such as boosting domestic innovation. In areas such as climate change and non-proliferation, cooperation with China may be possible and even necessary. In other arenas, Washington will simply have to take a deep breath and acknowledge where greater Chinese influence actually doesn\u2019t matter all that much to the United States.All the while, the competition for friends will rarely be one of strict strategic alignment, but rather an effort to build coalitions of the willing on different issues, such as responding to China\u2019s unfair trade practices, supporting Taiwan or dealing with repression in Xinjiang.ADADThis is where the China debate should now focus: not on top-down questions of how to wage or avoid a Cold War, but rather a bottom-up effort to renew American competitiveness, with more serious debates about specific issues and less nostalgia or neuralgia over past rivalries.In December 1989, George H.W. Bush and Mikhail Gorbachev met in Malta to declare the Cold War over. It still is. A new and different era of competition between the United States and China is dawning. Washington needs to update its mind-set as well.Read more:Fareed Zakaria: China has been bungling its post-coronavirus foreign policyJosh Rogin: Trump\u2019s China hawks are loose and not wasting any timeCharles Dunst: Welcome to China\u2019s new interventionist foreign policyJohn Pomfret: The Trump administration\u2019s China policies are ironically bolstering BeijingDavid Ignatius: We may be dramatically overestimating China\u2019s capabilities", "comment": "214 Comments", "topic": "Global Opinions"}, {"cover": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/7TSN3UF4JYI6VDHVTQNY274EYY.jpghttps://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/7TSN3UF4JYI6VDHVTQNY274EYY.jpg", "title": "Countries prepare to take in Hong Kong refugees fleeing \u2019s crackdown", "date": "Jul 2, 2020", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/countries-brace-for-influx-of-hong-kong-refugees-fleeing-chinas-crackdown/2020/07/02/8ee844a2-bc12-11ea-97c1-6cf116ffe26c_story.html", "keyword": "China and Security", "website": "the Washington Post", "author": "Gerry ShihShibani Mahtani", "content": "TAIPEI, Taiwan \u2014 A day after China began to enforce a sweeping national security law over Hong Kong, several governments were moving to offer the territory's residents the opportunity to resettle abroad as they grapple with the new reality of a city fundamentally transformed by the legislation.Support our journalism.

On its first day, the office received 180 inquiries from Hong Kong, many of them from people interested in an investment immigration program, said Chiu Chui-Cheng, deputy head of Taiwan\u2019s Mainland Affairs Council.China\u2019s security law sends chill through Hong Kong, 23 years after handoverThe immigration proposals amount to the first point of contention to arise immediately in the wake of the national security legislation\u2019s rollout, with foreign governments, particularly Washington, poised to make more moves in response.ADADAs early as this week, Congress could seek President Trump\u2019s signature on a \u201cHong Kong Autonomy\u201d bill that would enforce sanctions on banks that do business with certain Chinese government entities, dramatically raising the stakes in the fight over the city of roughly 7.5 million people.Lawmakers from both parties and chambers also launched \u201csafe harbor\u201d legislation that would require the State Department to designate as humanitarian refugees Hong Kongers who organized the protests or provided volunteer medical aid or media coverage at the events. Those people could arrive in the United States under the legislation and seek permanent residency or citizenship.Hong Kong police made 370 arrests Wednesday as thousands of people poured into the streets to protest the law, which took effect at midnight. Some radical protesters fought police, blocked traffic, vandalized stores and chanted independence slogans \u2014 actions newly defined by the law as terrorism and separatism.ADADPolice said they arrested 10 people on the first day under the new law, including a 15-year old girl who waved a pro-independence flag and a 24-year-old man who was accused of stabbing a police officer. Police said the man was escorted off a flight Thursday moments before it took off for London, where he presumably sought to flee.Under the new legislation, Chinese prosecutors could try suspects on the mainland \u2014 where the prosecution is virtually guaranteed to win in Communist Party-controlled courts \u2014 or before special Hong Kong tribunals without juries. Hong Kong\u2019s Bar Association said Wednesday it was \u201cgravely concerned\u201d by the contents of the new law \u2014 especially the extradition provisions \u2014 as well as by its passage, which came after the measures were drafted in secret in Beijing.China\u2019s Foreign Ministry responded angrily Thursday to Johnson\u2019s proposal to welcome Hong Kongers and warned Australia against moving down a \u201cwrong path.\u201d Britain had explicitly promised it would not offer such a deal to the city\u2019s inhabitants \u2014 and would recognize them solely as Chinese subjects \u2014 as part of the agreement to hand over the territory in 1997, said ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian.ADADThe offer would be a \u201cbreach of international law and basic norms governing international relations,\u201d Zhao said, while also warning that China could take \u201ccountermeasures.\u201dHong Kong families, fearing a reign of terror, prepare to flee the cityIt was not immediately clear whether China was threatening punitive visa measures against British citizens living in Hong Kong or considering a ban on Hong Kongers seeking to move to Britain. As rumors spread Thursday that outbound travel could be broadly restricted, the Hong Kong government issued a statement dismissing the speculation as \u201cfake news.\u201dBut British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab acknowledged in an interview with ITV that there was little his government could do if China moved to bar Hong Kongers from flying out.AD\u201cUltimately, we need to be honest that we wouldn\u2019t be able to force China to allow BNOs to come to the U.K.,\u201d Raab said, referring to the British National (Overseas) passport that roughly 350,000 Hong Kong residents obtained before 1997 when they were still colonial subjects.ADBritain\u2019s offer was striking, given that Johnson swept to power on a promise to take the country out of the European Union, gaining support from many anti-immigration voters. Yet historic ties with Hong Kong and the prospect of an influx of highly educated and entrepreneurial migrants make this a different political proposition for the government; polls show that British voters who support the proposal outnumber those opposed by roughly three to one.With Hong Kong security law, China writes broad international powers for itselfSteve Tsang, director of the SOAS China Institute in London, said it was not a difficult political position for Western governments to take despite the high tide of anti-immigration sentiment.AD\u201cNo country wants to have massive, sudden immigration,\u201d Tsang said. \u201cBut it speaks to how [Chinese President] Xi Jinping has turned world public opinion against China.\u201d ADTsang said he doubted that even 10 percent of the 3 million people qualified to move to Britain would consider doing so. And other than a few protest figures sought by security agencies, China would not bother with trying to bar ordinary Hong Kongers, especially malcontents, from leaving, he added. \u201cMost people in Hong Kong don\u2019t want to leave,\u201d Tsang said. \u201cIf you\u2019re willing to see your children be given patriotic education, if you\u2019re willing to stay at home and keep your mouth shut, if you\u2019re willing to not speak up against the Communist Party \u2014 and most Hong Kongers do not \u2014 you\u2019ll be okay. So we\u2019re talking maybe tens of thousands who would want to leave, but not substantially more.\u201dIn Hong Kong, thousands await trial for alleged offenses during the pro-democracy protests, including rioting, which carries a maximum sentence of 10 years under the new legislation.Pro-bono groups that facilitate departures of arrested protesters by sponsoring airfares or setting them up with jobs overseas say they have been inundated with requests.ADADA volunteer from one of these groups said arrested protesters are now concerned that judges will be under pressure to hand down the highest sentence possible, even if the national security law is not retroactive.\u201cThey feel very negative about their situation,\u201d he said, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of his work. \u201cSuddenly, it is like all the rules have changed.\u201dMost of these people, he added, were born after 1997, and therefore do not possess British National (Overseas) passports and will not be able to seek citizenship in Britain under Johnson\u2019s proposal.While Taiwan was a popular option for fleeing protesters last year, the volunteer said this group is looking farther afield to Europe and Australia, concerned that the Chinese Communist Party could still reach into Taiwan, a self-governed democracy that Beijing claims as its territory, and find ways to punish them there.ADAD\u201cEven when we ask for legal help, our lawyers say that they have never seen a law like this and cannot judge its implications,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, our advice is that if you are arrested under a serious charge, it is best to just leave if you can.\u201dMahtani reported from Hong Kong.With Hong Kong security law, China writes broad international powers for itselfChina\u2019s security law sends chill through Hong Kong, 23 years after handoverHong Kong families, fearing a reign of terror, prepare to flee the city", "comment": "285 Comments", "topic": "Asia & Pacific"}, {"cover": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/FJYEMKF2QII6VF6BNTYRN77CNQ.jpghttps://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/FJYEMKF2QII6VF6BNTYRN77CNQ.jpg", "title": " strangles its world city", "date": "Jul 3, 2020", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2020/07/03/china-strangles-hong-kong-global-city/", "keyword": "China and Security", "website": "the Washington Post", "author": "Ishaan Tharoor", "content": "Want smart analysis of the most important news in your inbox every weekday, along with other global reads, interesting ideas and opinions to know?

The world\u2019s urban centers \u2014 coastal entrepots teeming with merchant ships, oases at the heart of caravan routes, the fortified capitals of cosmopolitan empires \u2014 wax and wane through history. They can fall in both dramatic and imperceptible ways, laid low by the invader\u2019s ax and flame, but also by political upheaval oceans away or the steady toll of drought and climate change.Support our journalism. Subscribe today.arrow-rightWe may now be watching a famous world city go through such a demise, a loss of status that feels both sudden and long in the making.ADFor decades, Hong Kong styled itself as Asia\u2019s preeminent metropolis, a bustling former British colony at the center of the continent\u2019s trade and logistics networks and the main international gateway to the booming Chinese market. Expats waltzed into Hong Kong as if it was an analogue of London or New York City. Local Hong Kongers exercised civil liberties unthinkable on the other side of the border with the mainland.ADBut those freedoms seemed to come under constant threat since Britain handed over Hong Kong to China\u2019s authoritarian regime in 1997. Moves, large and small, by local authorities and their masters in Beijing to curtail Hong Kong\u2019s special liberties sparked repeated rounds of protests, including the wave of demonstrations that paralyzed the city last year. And then, in one fell swoop, China dropped the hammer.In what the Economist dubbed \u201cone of the biggest assaults on a liberal society since the Second World War,\u201d China implemented a sweeping, new national security law for Hong Kong on midnight Tuesday. \u201cOvernight, Hong Kong\u2019s 7.5 million residents were put under the same speech restrictions as the mainland, with possible life imprisonment for those deemed guilty of subversion \u2014 a standard charge used to jail political dissidents and human rights activists in China,\u201d my colleagues reported.To many observers, the law marks the definitive end to an era. It\u2019s the latest and perhaps most emphatic demonstration of the draconian grip of Chinese President Xi Jinping, who has shrunk the space for civil society throughout China, steadily squeezed political dissent in Hong Kong and erected a dystopia of mass detention camps for persecuted ethnic minorities in the far-western region of Xinjiang.ADAD\u201cHong Kong is a great world city, not a remote area like Xinjiang. But the government of Xi Jinping is now clearly determined to bring it into line,\u201d wrote the editorial board of the Financial Times. \u201cThe formula of \u2018one country, two systems\u2019 applied to Hong Kong since 1997 and sanctified in international agreements seems in effect to be over \u2014 a point underlined by the way the national security legislation was written and imposed from Beijing, without any participation by the Hong Kong government or legislature.\u201d Thousands of Hong Kongers still took to the streets in a show of defiance this week. Hundreds were arrested. The fear is that the breadth of the new law \u2014 which apparently also extends to people living outside of China\u2019s legal jurisdiction \u2014 could break the popular will to stand against Beijing.This week\u2019s events can be interpreted as \u201ca bloodless version\u201d of China\u2019s 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre, Steve Tsang, a historian of Hong Kong at London\u2019s School of Oriental and African Studies, told the Atlantic. \u201cPeople tend to focus on the killing [at Tiananmen], but the killing was an instrument,\u201d he said. \u201cThe objective was to intimidate and terrify the people so that people don\u2019t even think about [protesting] again.\u201dADADNot long ago, Hong Kong was seen as the city that would prefigure a more liberal, prosperous future for China. Now, its protesters are the canaries in the coal mine, left to voice the final cries of a society whose democratic aspirations are withering on the vine. Rather than seeing a metropolis of the future, analysts point to Hungary in 1956 or Prague in 1968.Chinese officials seem unmoved by the torrent of Western criticism and sanctions coming their way. \u201cThe era when the Chinese cared what others thought and looked up to others is in the past, never to return,\u201d Zhang Xiaoming, the executive director of China\u2019s Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, told reporters.Nor do they seem much bothered by the news this week that a host of foreign governments \u2014 including Australia, Taiwan, the United States and, most importantly, Britain \u2014 are considering fast-tracking permits for potentially millions of Hong Kong refugees seeking to quit their home city. That exodus may take place alongside a flight of Western capital and business \u2014 especially if the United States decides to scrap its special trade relationship with the territory, as President Trump has pledged to do.ADADHong Kong\u2019s diminishment may be worth the cost for Beijing, which can count on global business regardless and attract investors to gleaming megacities such as Shenzhen and Shanghai. But it may also serve the interests of the more radical set of Hong Kong\u2019s protesters, who see the impossible odds of confronting the leviathan in Beijing yet still want to intensify the showdown. \u201cIf we burn, you burn with us,\u201d a catchphrase from the Hunger Games series, has become a popular refrain.\u201cThe choice is between dying quietly without the world noticing, or dying with dignity with the world noticing, and at the same time creating the chance of causing some damage to the people who kill Hong Kong,\u201d Ho-Fung Hung, a professor of political economy at Johns Hopkins University, told Quartz.\u201cHong Kong\u2019s people have continually shown an ability to defy impossible odds and create beauty even in the harshest settings,\u201d wrote Jeffrey Wasserstrom, the author of \u201cVigil: Hong Kong on the Brink.\u201d But he laments the creeping nihilism of the times.\u201cI am filled with sadness,\u201d he wrote, \u201cand find it hard to see anything but darkness ahead for the city.\u201d Read more:Putin\u2019s term-limit win suggests stagnation, not strengthWhatever Israel decides, a one-state reality loomsChina\u2019s campaign of \u2018genocide\u2019 could bring the U.S. and E.U. closer together", "comment": "198 Comments", "topic": "Today's WorldView"}, {"cover": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/34WRM2F34UI6VDHVTQNY274EYY.jpghttps://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/34WRM2F34UI6VDHVTQNY274EYY.jpg", "title": " has just broken its solemn promise to Hong Kong", "date": "Jul 1, 2020", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/global-opinions/china-has-just-broken-its-solemn-promise-to-hong-kong/2020/07/01/fd857b0e-bbc8-11ea-80b9-40ece9a701dc_story.html", "keyword": "China and Security", "website": "the Washington Post", "author": "Editorial Board", "content": "HONG KONG as it has been known \u2014 a bastion of free speech and rule of law, an autonomous, glittering capital of capitalism \u2014 has been smothered.

Subscribe today.arrow-rightThe law was passed in secret by the Standing Committee of the National People\u2019s Congress in Beijing and signed by President Xi Jinping before people in Hong Kong had even seen the text. The law defines as punishable offenses: \u201csecession, subversion, organisation and perpetration of terrorist activities, and collusion with a foreign country or with external elements to endanger national security.\u201d These words are right out of China\u2019s dictatorial handbook, and can be used arbitrarily to stop anything the authorities dislike. One provision specifically allows for prosecution of anyone \u201cprovoking by unlawful means hatred among Hong Kong residents\u201d toward either the Beijing or Hong Kong governments. A few years ago, China plotted to nab booksellers from Hong Kong who sold gossip volumes about China\u2019s leaders. Now, anyone who hoists a placard that says \u201cDown with President Xi Jinping!\u201d might well draw a jail term.The law creates a division for investigating threats to national security \u2014 a secret police \u2014 and gives Beijing a strong hand in how it will work. One of the more remarkable provisions in the new law, Article 38, states that it covers offenses committed \u201coutside the Region by a person who is not a permanent resident of the Region.\u201d This suggests a long arm of the Chinese thought police, intent on punishing people outside Hong Kong who stir up criticism of the government. For all practical purposes, a critic might not be prosecuted abroad, but woe to those who set foot in Hong Kong.ADADChina has broken its promise to Britain on the handover of Hong Kong in 1997 to preserve the concept of \u201cone country, two systems\u201d for 50 years. Many hoped Hong Kong\u2019s system might rub off on China, but in the end, China\u2019s overwhelmed Hong Kong. This makes it even more imperative for the West to stand by the vibrant democracy of Taiwan.China seems unconcerned by recent protests and threats of sanctions from the United States, and no wonder, considering Mr. Trump\u2019s evident disinterest. A response worthy of consideration is legislation in Congress introduced by Rep. Tom Malinowski (D-N.J.) and Rep. Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.) that would open a pathway to enter the United States for Hong Kong entrepreneurs, scientists and academics. Britain is also considering a special five-year visa for as many as 2.9 million Hong Kong citizens with British national overseas status.These measures will help individuals escape China\u2019s persecution, but the flame of Hong Kong\u2019s democratic ideals has been abruptly extinguished.

So I was positively astonished Monday when I saw Patrick Collison, the CEO of payments firm Stripe, tweet that \u201cAs a US business (and tech) community I think we should be significantly clearer about our horror at, and opposition to, the atrocities being committed by the Chinese government against its own people.\u201dSupport our journalism. Subscribe today.arrow-rightOn first read, that sentiment might seem banal. Of course we should clearly oppose China\u2019s intensifying political repression. But it is easier to list American business leaders who have cravenly excused the inexcusable than to name those such as Collison, who have been brave enough to state the obvious. When it comes to China\u2019s human rights abuses, the position of the American business community is prone.China has just passed a national security law for Hong Kong that has essentially ended any hope of liberal democracy there. The Associated Press reports that the Chinese government has added forced abortion and mandatory birth control to the mass surveillance, concentration camps and family separations that it has already inflicted on its Uighur community. This is inching close to attempted genocide, and it is what inspired Collison\u2019s tweet.ADADThere\u2019s a legitimate argument that businesses should be loath to take political stands \u2014 don\u2019t they have enough to do, just making products and selling them? But that defense is hard to maintain as my inbox overflows with messages from companies that want to be sure I know about their latest initiatives to fight systemic racism and police brutality. These are worthy causes, but embracing politics looks more convenient than moral if your principles vanish at the first sign that they might cost you something. And that\u2019s particularly true since the U.S. business community is probably the group with the most power to actually change China\u2019s behavior.Ali Wyne of the Atlantic Council recently told me that corporate pressure would likely be a \u201cmore potent source of medium- to long-term pressure on China to change its human rights behavior than \u2026 political admonishments from the U.S. government.\u201d Condemning U.S. racism, however, is costless, while standing up to China risks corporate investments in cheap Chinese manufacturing, or companies\u2019 access to China\u2019s 1.4 billion consumers. So it takes a leader like Collison, who does only limited business with China, to say what has to be said.It is not an accident, Collison told me, that Stripe has limited investment in China. It was a deliberate choice, because of both the moral and economic costs of doing business within an unfree state. But most CEOs decided that the benefits \u2014 among them the vast labor pool and even vaster consumer market \u2014 outweighed those costs.ADADTen years ago, it was easy to believe that those moral costs would soon dissipate. Trade would expose China to liberal democratic ideas, and as they got richer, they would get more free. It\u2019s still possible that that happy vision will come true, but if so, that future seems a long way off.Instead, it seems that China, having read the same arguments about the liberalizing effect of trade, is cracking down to ensure that we don\u2019t export our democratic values. And so, we risk importing their despotic ones. Hollywood trims its major releases to meet the demands of Chinese government censors; airlines change their maps to erase Taiwan; U.S. business leaders, even its athletic stars, suddenly become tongue-tied about the value of freedom.\u201cIt must be possible,\u201d Collison tells me, \u201cto acknowledge the basic facts \u2014 for example, that concentration camps and forced sterilization programs are reprehensible evils. If it becomes de facto unacceptable to do so, as part of some kind of self-perpetuating silence, it really seems to me that that\u2019s a positive feedback loop that we should hurry to break.\u201dADADThat\u2019s not something that one leader can do alone; it\u2019s more likely to take all of them. \u201cChina does need U.S. markets and U.S. companies in aggregate. They can\u2019t ban everyone and there can be safety in numbers,\u201d Collison says. It\u2019s possible, of course, that the Chinese might decide to give up U.S. markets rather than liberalize, as they gave up Hong Kong\u2019s usefulness as a financial hub. But if we can make a difference, we should find out.Despite Collison\u2019s example, most CEOs probably won\u2019t take that risk on their own; they will be too afraid of being undercut by less scrupulous competitors who retain their access to China\u2019s markets and manufacturing prowess. So on this Fourth of July, it falls to the American public to take the same stand for liberty, equality and justice abroad that we recently have at home. We must force U.S. businesses to state, loudly and without equivocation, that all people have certain inalienable rights, even if they live in China, and that defending those rights is worth our lives, our sacred honor and, yes, even our fortunes.Read more:ADADGeorge F.

The new law mocks the rule of law, which requires sufficient specificity to give those subject to the law due notice of what is proscribed or prohibited. The new law stipulates four major offenses: separatism, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign governments. These will be defined post facto, in capricious enforcements against those whose speech is not chilled by the law\u2019s menacing vagueness. The \u201claw\u201d authorizing the committee to operate secretly was released at 11 p.m. Tuesday, probably to deter demonstrations on Wednesday, which was the anniversary of the 1997 handover.Modern technologies of communication enable the world to watch darkness descend on one of the world\u2019s most vibrant metropolises. Modern technologies of surveillance enable Beijing to refine a deep, penetrating oppression beyond what Winston Churchill could have imagined when he warned that Nazism\u2019s triumph would mean the world would \u201csink into the abyss of a new Dark Age made more sinister, and perhaps more protracted, by the lights of perverted science.\u201dADADChina\u2019s faux law, which echoes Stalin\u2019s use of randomness to intensify fear, serves two purposes: It smashes Hong Kong dissent \u2014 Leninism brooks no challenge to the party\u2019s supremacy. And it distracts attention from reports that Beijing is pioneering a sinister fusionism that melds Leninism and Stalinism with an ethno-nationalism reminiscent of fascism.The regime reportedly is employing forced abortions and sterilization to inflict what has been called \u201cdemographic genocide\u201d on Muslim Uighurs and other minorities. U.S. customs officials have seized some China-made beauty products perhaps made from human hair harvested in Xinjiang concentration camps. China\u2019s signatures on the U.N. Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide and on the Sino-British Joint Declaration guaranteeing Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy are equally constraining. Next year, President Joe Biden and a Democratic-controlled Congress should match Britain\u2019s generosity in welcoming refugees from Hong Kong\u2019s talented, freedom-loving citizenry.In diplomatic parlance, China is a \u201crevisionist\u201d power, aiming to revise the global order. In less antiseptic language, it is a piratical power whose crudeness, born of cultural condescension toward others, includes special contempt for an America distracted domestically by various hysterias, and choosing retreat abroad. President Biden\u2019s urgent foreign policy tasks will include revising the long-standing U.S. policy of \u201cstrategic ambiguity\u201d regarding Taiwan. Beijing is demonstrating in Hong Kong \u201cone country, two systems\u201d actually means one country, one simmering stew of Leninism and Stalinism flavored with fascism.ADADThe dictator Xi Jinping has repeatedly said that Taiwan\u2019s current status \u2014 nationhood in all but name \u2014 is intolerable and \u201cshould not be passed down generation after generation.\u201d A reelected President Trump, whose cramped notion of America\u2019s role in the world is confined to commercial bookkeeping, might swap Taiwan\u2019s freedom for increased Chinese purchases of U.S. soybeans. When at noon Jan. 20 the United States ends the policy of making America marginal again, Biden should adopt strategic clarity, informing Beijing that the U.S. legal obligation to sell Taiwan weaponry needed for self-defense entails a moral obligation to assist with that project.The Korean War, which brought Americans into combat against Chinese troops, began 70 years ago after Dean Acheson, President Harry S. Truman\u2019s secretary of state, gave a speech in which he left South Korea outside his definition of America\u2019s defense perimeter. Beijing has drawn a \u201cnine-dash line\u201d to demarcate extravagant claims to sovereignty over the South China Sea \u2014 claims incompatible with international law and disdainful of the legal rights of various nations in the region. The Biden administration should draw a line that places Taiwan within the sphere of regional nations whose self-defense implicates vital U.S. interests.Beijing should remember this: France\u2019s Committee of Public Safety was created in April 1793. Maximilien Robespierre, who prefigured Lenin, joined it on July 27. One year and a day later, devoured by forces he had fomented, he was guillotined in Paris\u2019s Place de la R\u00e9volution, now called Place de la Concorde. Beijing\u2019s totalitarians, who have murderous French precursors, may one day have a similarly disagreeable rendezvous with their handiwork.ADAD\n\nRead more from George F.

Subscribe today.arrow-rightThe action comes weeks after Iran sent five tankers and 1.5\u00a0million barrels of gasoline in a symbolic gesture of support to embattled Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro in defiance of the Trump administration.A U.S. judge in Washington signed a seizure warrant Thursday for Venezuela-bound shipments aboard four other tankers \u2014 the Bella, Bering, Pandi and Luna \u2014 whose deliveries were disrupted. Prosecutors estimated their cargo included 1.2 million barrels of gasoline worth nearly $50 million \u2014 the seizure of which would be a blow the U.S. government aimed at Iran\u2019s use of third-party shippers to avert economic penalties.ADADIn a civil forfeiture lawsuit and statement filed late Wednesday, U.S. officials in Washington cited a network of informants indicating the fuel was \u201ca source of influence\u201d for Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, which the United States has designated a terrorist organization. Prosecutors claimed the movements were arranged by Mahmoud Madanipour, an Iran-based man affiliated with the Revolutionary Guard.Madanipour purportedly acted on behalf of Mobin International Ltd., a firm associated with Guard Corps-connected bank accounts, prosecutors said. Madanipour and the firm also are associated with a United Arab Emirates trading company that the suit did not name that moved to conceal the shipments\u2019 Iranian origin, prosecutors and Homeland Security Investigations agents said.A text message between Madanipour and a co-conspirator noted difficulties in the voyage of the Liberian-flagged Bella and the Bering, after the United States threatened the Greek owners with possible sanctions, court filings state.ADAD\u201cThe co-conspirator texted, \u2018the ship owner doesn\u2019t want to go because of the American threat, but we want him to go, and we even agreed We will also buy the ship,\u2019\u2009\u201d prosecutors wrote in court filings.Read the civil forfeiture lawsuit hereRead the seizure warrant application hereU.S. authorities said any funds seized would be directed in part to a fund for U.S. victims of state-sponsored terrorism, according to a statement by the Justice Department\u2019s national security division, the U.S. attorney\u2019s office for the District of Columbia, Homeland Security Investigations and the FBI.Madanipour could not immediately be reached for comment, and UAE-based Mobin did not immediately respond to requests for comment.The Iranian mission to the United Nations said the seizure would be \u201cpiracy.\u201dAD\u201cAny attempt on the high seas to prevent Iran from engaging in lawful trade with any country it chooses will be an act of piracy, pure and simple,\u201d said Alireza Miryousefi, a spokesman for Tehran\u2019s office in New York. \u201cThis is a direct threat to international peace and security and in contravention of international law including the U.N. Charter.\u201dADThe U.S. move against the tankers is the latest action in a two-year \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d campaign of sanctions that have decimated Iran\u2019s economy. And it comes as the Trump administration is making a major push to get support for an extension of a United Nations arms embargo due to expire in October.Secretary of State Mike Pompeo pressed the U.S. case at the Security Council this week, where he called Iran \u201cthe world\u2019s most heinous terrorist regime\u201d and raised fears it could become a rogue arms provider to militant groups throughout the region.ADBrian Hook, the State Department\u2019s special envoy for Iran, has just completed meetings in the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Israel, where senior officials expressed concern that lifting the embargo could fuel a regional arms race, according to accounts provided by the office of the department\u2019s spokesman.ADHook also went to Vienna on Friday to meet with the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, a visit designed to highlight a U.S. demand that Iran provide the agency access to suspicious sites where the United States believes Tehran is safeguarding research on developing a nuclear bomb. Iran has repeatedly denied the accusation and called the intelligence behind the charges fabricated.U.S. officials have tightened sanctions on Iran\u2019s oil industry, a mainstay of its economy, saying the Revolutionary Guard and its major holdings have extensive interests in it and use the profits to support terrorism, proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and human rights abuses.ADU.S. sanctions officials assert one network led by the guard\u2019s elite Quds Force in spring 2019 alone used more than a dozen vessels to covertly transport nearly 14 million barrels of crude oil and other petroleum products, grossing more than $750 million.ADThis week\u2019s actions came almost exactly one year after British authorities  seized the Grace 1, an Iranian oil tanker, in Gibraltar, alleging it was carrying oil to Syria in violation of a European Union embargo. Soon after the July 4 incident, Iran detained a British-flagged tanker, the Stena Impero, in the Strait of Hormuz.Gibraltar ultimately released the Iranian ship in August, despite a last-minute request by the same U.S. attorney\u2019s office in Washington to permit the United States to seize the ship, its oil and $1 million, alleging U.S. sanctions violations.ADU.S. authorities in May charged two Iranian men and seized $12 million used to purchase a now-detained Liberian-flagged oil tanker, the Nautic, in what was then billed as the largest seizure of funds used to support the Quds Force. ADWashington also hit the five captains of the Iranian-flagged tankers that successfully delivered oil to Venezuela with sanctions.A State Department official said the sanctions have been effective in depriving Venezuela of its major source of revenue.\u201cThe global shipping community is moving out of doing business with Venezuela in the face of U.S. sanctions,\u201d said Elliott Abrams, the special envoy for Venezuela, in an emailed statement. \u201cThe most reputable firms, including the largest Greek shipping companies, have been cooperative and have shown that they value their reputations and their global businesses.\u201dADThe Wall Street Journal, which first reported the U.S. disruption of the other Venezuela-bound deliveries of Iranian oil products, has also reported that the Trump administration is preparing to add as many as 50 tankers to U.S. commercial blacklists for working with Maduro\u2019s government.ADWednesday\u2019s court filings state that Madanipour and Mobin International worked with the National Iranian Oil Co. and entities associated with it and the Guard Corps. Madanipour took steps to conceal the involvement of Iranian entities in previous shipments or potential deliveries to China and Malaysia, prosecutors asserted.For example, the filings state the UAE company, identified only as \u201cCompany 1,\u201d in January asked the owner of the Pandi to carry gasoline from Iran to the UAE but that Madanipour changed documents to show that Mobin International was responsible for the voyage. The UAE company then invoiced for $14.9 million an entity that the Guard Corps has publicly said was operating on its behalf and that ran the Grace 1 last year, the filings said.ADProsecutors said Mobin International in March 2019 described setting up a new Persian Gulf country joint venture \u201cto be secured of any risk of sanctions\u201d and \u201chandle all our transshipments of risky oil business.\u201dADAccording to the court filing, an associate in 2017 also asked Madanipour \u2014  allegedly on behalf of proposed Chinese buyers \u2014 whether Iranian oil could be provided through other countries with payments made through other countries to avoid U.S. sanctions. \u201cWe can get payment in Oman, UAE, Turkey, Italy and Germany,\u201d Madanipour replied, according to court documents.It was unclear whether the Bella, Bering, Pandi and Luna had been detained. Shipping tracking websites placed the first two Greek-owned vessels most recently in the Aegean Sea, and the other two in the Gulf of Oman.\n\n\n\nU.S. seizes millions, disrupts purchase of oil tanker in move targeting Iran\u2019s elite Quds ForceAs tankers head toward the Caribbean, growing Iran-Venezuela ties draw U.S. concernU.S. finds little support for extending arms embargo against IranLocal newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Like PostLocal on Facebook | ", "comment": "0 Comments", "topic": "Legal Issues"}, {"cover": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/AXIXLAWSJ4I6VATLZQ4U3ASOGU.jpghttps://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/AXIXLAWSJ4I6VATLZQ4U3ASOGU.jpg", "title": "Trump says he plans to bar TikTok from operating in the U.S.", "date": "Jul 31, 2020", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/07/31/tiktok-trump-divestiture/", "keyword": "China and Security", "website": "the Washington Post", "author": "Ellen NakashimaRachel LermanJeanne Whalen", "content": "President Trump said late Friday he plans to ban Chinese-owned TikTok from operating in the United States, the latest sign of the administration\u2019s increasingly strident stance on China and its tech companies.Support our journalism. Subscribe today.arrow-right\u201cAs far as TikTok is concerned, we\u2019re banning them from the United States,\u201d Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One.Earlier Friday, Trump was considering signing an order forcing China\u2019s ByteDance to sell off the U.S. portion of TikTok over national security concerns, according to people familiar with the talks, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss them publicly. One of the individuals confirmed Microsoft was in the lead to acquire the popular platform\u2019s U.S. service.While the order was expected to be signed Friday, people had warned that it could fall through since the president was also considering other approaches, including designating TikTok under an executive order that allows the president to exclude national security threats from U.S. networks.Late Friday, the president told reporters he was not in favor of a deal to let a U.S. company buy TikTok\u2019s U.S. operations. Trump said he could use emergency economic powers or an executive order to ban TikTok.ADAD\u201cWell, I have that authority. I can do it with an executive order or that,\u201d he said, referring to emergency economic powers.The order that would force a sale, which stems from a national security investigation, is fairly rare but has been used by Trump as recently as March, when the president ordered a Chinese company to sell its stake in a U.S. hotel-software company. Last year, the Trump administration used it to demand the Chinese owners of gay dating app Grindr give up control of the company.If Microsoft did acquire TikTok, it would make it a major rival to Facebook, Google\u2019s YouTube and other tech giants overnight, dramatically reshaping the U.S. social media landscape. ADThe prospect of a forced sale came amid growing concern among U.S. officials that the Chinese government could access users\u2019 private data, something that prompted Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to say earlier this month that the United States is \u201ccertainly looking at\u201d banning TikTok.ADBranches of the U.S. military, including the Army and Navy, have banned the app from government-issued phones. The Pentagon urged its employees last year to uninstall the app due to security concerns.On Friday, Trump reiterated that option. \u201cWe may be banning TikTok,\u201d Trump told reporters before leaving for Florida. \u201cWe may be doing some other things. There are a couple of options. But a lot of things are happening, so we\u2019ll see what happens. But we are looking at a lot of alternatives with respect to TikTok.\u201dADTikTok spokesperson Hilary McQuaide declined to comment on the expected order, but she said they are \u201cconfident in the long-term success of TikTok.\u201d Microsoft spokesman Frank Shaw declined to comment. Bloomberg News first reported the news on the divestiture.The other order the government could apply is the 2019 International Economic Emergency Powers Act, which effectively bans any communications tool that is a national security threat to the United States.ADIf Trump uses the \u201cfull force\u201d of the remedies under the executive order, said Stewart Baker, a former National Security Agency general counsel, \u201cNo American could work for them. The app store couldn\u2019t make them available. American advertisers couldn\u2019t pay them for ads. It would be economically devastating for them.\u201dADTikTok has continually insisted that it does not hand over information to the Chinese government. \u201cWe have never provided user data to the Chinese government, nor would we do so if asked,\u201d McQuaide said earlier this month.The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, an interagency body whose powers were strengthened by 2018 legislation, recommends to the president whether certain proposed takeovers should be rejected, and whether completed takeovers should be reversed, on national security grounds. CFIUS began investigating an acquisition by Beijing-based ByteDance after lawmakers asked the government to step in over national security concerns.ADByteDance bought karaoke app Musical.ly in 2017 and merged it with TikTok, launching the app to mass popularity in the United States.ADJames Andrew Lewis, vice president of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said foreign companies usually take the hint when they think a demand from the U.S. government will be coming.\u201cUsually everyone gets the message and takes action without waiting for formal government action,\u201d he said.TikTok says it will let U.S. skeptics see its code to defray privacy concernsBuying TikTok could reshape the Big Tech landscape, giving Microsoft a strong foothold in the U.S. consumer market with one of the world\u2019s fastest growing social media platforms. Unlike many of its competitors, Microsoft does not have a creative social media company to sow brand recognition with younger users, though the Redmond, Wash.-based company does own professional networking site LinkedIn.ADADWhile the acquisition could raise some antitrust eyebrows, regulators haven\u2019t typically blocked acquisitions of business lines that are dissimilar from what a company already does. Microsoft also has deep ties with the U.S. government, most recently winning the Pentagon\u2019s JEDI cloud computing contract. Microsoft as a buyer could help quell administration security concerns about TikTok data.Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg called out TikTok as a rival during a congressional antitrust hearing earlier this week, at which Microsoft was noticeably absent.TikTok has tried in recent months to convince U.S. users and regulators of its strong ties to the country. It emphasizes that it has hundreds of employees in the United States and even hired former Disney executive Kevin Mayer to be its new chief executive in May.ADADOn Wednesday, Mayer pledged the company will allow U.S. regulators and privacy experts to take a closer look under its digital hood, offering them the ability to \u201cexamine\u201d its underlying software code in response to claims it is handing off data to the Chinese government.The app, which lets users create and post short videos with music and other effects, has surged in popularity even more during the coronavirus pandemic as people search for at-home activities and distractions. Teens are especially active on TikTok, creating videos showcasing their dancing, pranks and cooking skills.This is the latest in a string of moves by the Trump administration to counter Chinese tech giants.ADTension has already come to a head over Chinese telecom giant Huawei, the world\u2019s largest provider of mobile network gear \u2014 a field from which U.S. companies are largely absent. The United States calls Huawei a security risk, which the company denies, and has undertaken an international lobbying campaign to persuade other countries not to buy from Huawei.ADThe Trump administration has also targeted other Chinese companies, restricting trade with more than a dozen it accuses of supplying surveillance gear in the western province of Xinjiang, where U.S. officials and human rights groups say China\u2019s ruling Communist Party is holding Muslims in mass detention camps.U.S. government investigating TikTok over national security concernsThe Trump administration has also previously used CFIUS to scrutinize, block or reverse Chinese acquisitions.In March, Trump ordered a Chinese company to divest all ownership of a U.S. hotel-software company, saying the Beijing investor could harm U.S. national security. A written order from the president\u2019s office suggested the administration was concerned about Chinese access to StayNTouch\u2019s hotel-guest data.The order, which followed a CFIUS review, instructed the Chinese company to immediately to refrain from accessing any of StayNTouch\u2019s hotel-guest data.ADThe Chinese company, Beijing Shiji Information Technology, acquired StayNTouch in 2018, saying the U.S. company\u2019s software was used in connection with 90,000 hotel rooms globally.After the order was issued, Beijing Shiji said it was \u201cnot a threat to U.S. security in any way.\u201d\u201cWe offered a range of significant proposals to mitigate any concerns the U.S. government might have, including further restricting access to guest data and appointing an independent monitor to ensure these protections. Unfortunately, those offers were rebuffed,\u201d the company said at the time.In 2018, after a CFIUS review, Trump ordered Singapore-based Broadcom to abandon its $117 billion bid for the U.S. semiconductor company Qualcomm, blocking what would have been one of the biggest technology deals in history.A full presidential order isn\u2019t always required to block or reverse a deal. Lawyers familiar with CFIUS reviews say the national security committee can tell a foreign company: sell the asset or the president will issue an order.That appears to be what happened last year, when the Trump administration forced a Chinese company to sell its majority stake in a U.S. health-care-data company, PatientsLikeMe.When Pompeo said earlier this month that TikTok might be banned, frantic users took to the app to bemoan its potential demise and urge followers to find them on other social media sites.TikTok users fear app shutdown as security concerns grow\u201cI really hope that this will not happen,\u201d one user said in a video. \u201cAll the videos, all the memories of you.

Trump\u2019s comments on Friday aboard Air Force One came after published reports that the administration is planning to order China\u2019s ByteDance to sell TikTok.ADAD\u201cAs far as TikTok is concerned, we\u2019re banning them from the United States,\u201d Trump told reporters Friday on Air Force One as he returned from Florida.Trump said he could use emergency economic powers or an executive order to enforce the action, insisting, \u201cI have that authority.\u201d He added, \u201cIt\u2019s going to be signed tomorrow.\u201dMicrosoft declined to comment.Reports by Bloomberg News and the Wall Street Journal citing anonymous sources said the administration could soon announce a decision ordering ByteDance to divest its ownership in TikTok.There have been reports of U.S. tech giants and financial firms being interested in buying or investing in TikTok as the Trump administration sets its sights on the app. The New York Times and Fox Business, citing an unidentified source, first reported Friday that Microsoft is  in talks to buy TikTok.ADADTikTok issued a statement Friday saying that, \u201cWhile we do not comment on rumors or speculation, we are confident in the long-term success of TikTok.\u201dOn Saturday it posted a short video from its U.S. General Manager Vanessa Pappas saying that \u201cWe\u2019re not planning on going anywhere.\u201dByteDance launched TikTok in 2017, then bought Musical.ly, a video service popular with teens in the U.S. and Europe, and combined the two. A twin service, Douyin, is available for Chinese users.TikTok\u2019s fun, goofy videos and ease of use has made it immensely popular, and U.S. tech giants like Facebook and Snapchat see it as a competitive threat. It has said it has tens of millions of U.S. users and hundreds of millions globally.ADBut its Chinese ownership has raised concerns about the censorship of videos, including those critical of the Chinese government, and the potential for sharing user data with Chinese officials.ADTikTok maintains it doesn\u2019t censor videos based on topics sensitive to China and it would not give the Chinese government access to U.S. user data even if asked. The company has hired a U.S. CEO, a former top Disney executive, in an attempt to distance itself from its Chinese ownership.U.S. national-security officials have been reviewing the Musical.ly acquisition in recent months, while U.S. armed forces have banned their employees from installing TikTok on government-issued phones. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said this month that the U.S. was considering banning TikTok.ADThese national-security worries parallel a broader U.S. security crackdown on Chinese companies, including telecom providers Huawei and ZTE. The Trump administration has ordered that the U.S. stop funding equipment from those providers in U.S. networks.  It has also tried to steer allies away from Huawei because of worries about the Chinese government\u2019s access to data, which the company has denied it has.ADThe Trump administration has stepped in before to block or dissolve deals on national-security concerns, including stopping Singapore\u2019s Broadcom from its $117 billion bid for U.S. chipmaker Qualcomm in 2018 in an effort to help retain U.S. leadership in the telecom space. It also told China\u2019s Beijing Kunlun Tech Co. to sell off its 2016 purchase of gay dating app Grindr.Other countries are also taking action against TikTok.  India this month banned dozens of Chinese apps, including TikTok, citing privacy concerns, amid tensions between the countries.ADThe U.S. government\u2019s poor track record in bolstering Americans\u2019 data privacy more broadly lessens its credibility in taking on Chinese-owned companies, according to Susan Ariel Aaronson, a professor at George Washington University and a data governance and national-security expert. The federal government has not passed broad privacy or data-security legislation despite efforts to do so last year, and the Justice Department has tried to undermine encryption - which makes sure only a sender and receiver can see content they exchange - for law-enforcement reasons. Tech companies have pushed back against that.AD\u201cI continue to be wary of forcing a sale of TikTok without data protection laws they could try to follow,\u201d Alex Stamos, the former chief security officer at Facebook who now studies internet security at Stanford University, tweeted on Friday. He added that Microsoft \u201chas one of the best child safety teams, which is a larger risk on TikTok right now.\u201dMicrosoft, which owns LinkedIn, is the No. 4 digital ad company in the U.S., after Google, Facebook and Amazon. Still, buying TikTok would be a significant change of direction from Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella\u2019s focus on workplace software that makes people more productive, said technology industry analyst Patrick Moorhead of Moor Insights & Strategy.ADUnlike Google or Facebook, which dominate the digital advertising industry, Microsoft hasn\u2019t been under the intense scrutiny of U.S. politicians and antitrust regulators lately over its market power. Moorhead said that might make it easier to swoop in and acquire TikTok, which poses a competitive threat to social networks like Facebook, Instagram, Google\u2019s YouTube and Snapchat.

Subscribe today.arrow-rightThe decision to put the Sept. 6 elections on hold \u2014 unprecedented in the city's political history since its handover from Britain to China in 1997 \u2014 was widely seen as another direct blow to Hong Kong's autonomy after Beijing imposed a new security law that sharply expanded powers to quash dissent in Hong Kong.It also closed off one of the few remaining forums for Hong Kong voters to express their voice. The legislative council races loomed as a potential slap against China and its stunning moves to curb Hong Kong's political freedoms after a waves of pro-democracy protests last year.ADADThe council elections were expected to bring a significant show of support for opponents of Beijing's increasing controls. In advance, Hong Kong officials disqualified a dozen pro-democracy candidates.Now, Hong Kong's chief executive, Carrie Lam, said the makeup of the 70-seat council will be decided by Beijing until new elections are held.\"This reflects that they \u2014 not us \u2014 are in fear, in fear of the people and of their voices,\" said Alvin Yeung, leader of the opposition Civic Party and one of the disqualified candidates.Lam said in a news conference that she was invoking emergency powers to postpone the vote, calling it the most \"difficult decision\" she has had to make since the onset of the virus here in January.AD\u201cWe have made the decision to postpone the election for one year,\u201d Lam said, after spending half an hour laying out her government\u2019s response to the pandemic and the potential health risks of holding the vote. Because of the pandemic, \u201cwe would not be able to meet the requirements of an open and fair election,\u201d she said.ADIn response to reporters\u2019 questions, she added: \u201cThere is absolutely no political agenda.\u201d The postponement, Lam said, was supported by Beijing since it is in the \u201cpublic interest.\u201dUnconvinced, opposition politicians and observers said the moves are designed to stack the political system with those loyal to the Chinese Communist Party and snuff out even moderate political opposition in Hong Kong.With virus flip-flops, Hong Kongers ponder whether their leaders are out to lunchA month ago, Beijing subverted Hong Kong\u2019s usual political processes to pass a new national security law that has outlawed broadly worded crimes such as secession, foreign interference and terrorism. Several people, including teenagers, have been arrested under that law, which has rewritten the legal underpinnings of the financial center and has had a broad chilling effect on speech.ADThe legislative council elections grew in significance as other ways of dissent were choked off. Only half of the 70\u00a0seats in Hong Kong\u2019s Legislative Council are directly elected, but given that the body has the power to enact and repeal laws, it is among the few avenues that residents have to express their political will.AD\u201cThey have basically redefined their definition of their enemies, and from one red line, we now have a few. Those red lines have become very thick,\u201d said the opposition leader Yeung.Pro-democracy candidates swept a majority of seats in local elections in November, a vote widely seen as an endorsement of their movement and a repudiation of the Beijing-allied elites.Over the past year, pro-democracy legislators have tried to stall or vote down bills, including Lam\u2019s proposal that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China and one that would criminalize mockery of the Chinese national anthem.Lam herself acknowledged that the elections were the \u201cbiggest\u201d in Hong Kong, with 4.4\u00a0million voters registered. Having so many people gathered, she said, poses a \u201cgreat risk,\u201d and registered voters who live in mainland China may not be able to travel into the city to cast their votes.ADADCountries such as Singapore and South Korea have held elections amid the covid-19 outbreak, which was severe in both places. In the 21 days since Singapore\u2019s election, the city-state, which has a population density similar to Hong Kong\u2019s, has not seen a jump in covid-19 cases, and daily community transmissions are in fact down to the single digits. Epidemiologists have noted that Hong Kong has begun to see gains in fighting this third wave of infections, and they predicted that daily cases, which have been a little over 100 in recent days, will likely drop in about four to six weeks.In Washington, White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said Friday that the election delay was \u201conly the most recent in a growing list of broken promises\u201d by Beijing on Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy.\u201cThis action undermines the democratic processes and freedoms that have underpinned Hong Kong\u2019s prosperity,\u201d McEnany said. On Thursday, President Trump proposed a delay to the November presidential election, claiming without evidence that widespread mail balloting would be a \u201ccatastrophic disaster.\u201d Republican leaders quickly said no such U.S. election delay was possible.ADADIn other fallout from Hong Kong\u2019s move, Germany joined Britain and other nations in suspending its extradition agreement with Hong Kong. A statement from Germany\u2019s foreign minister, Heiko Maas, called it a \u201cfurther infringement on the rights of Hong Kong\u2019s citizens.\u201dHong Kong police arrest four young people under Beijing\u2019s new security lawAnalysts have pointed out, too, that the Hong Kong government could have delayed the vote by a shorter period of several months and put in place a system such as postal or electronic voting. Other institutions of government, including courts that are currently prosecuting thousands of people arrested in pro-democracy protests last year, continue to be open as usual.\u201cDelaying it for a whole year is clearly overreach,\u201d said Antony Dapiran, a lawyer and writer on Hong Kong politics. \u201cIt gives them time to suppress the opposition for another year.\u201dADADSophie Richardson, China director at Human Rights Watch, said the move follows a pattern in which the pandemic has been used as cover to suppress political dissidents in mainland China. Hong Kong, she said, has long been a standout in the administration of elections, which are conducted in an open, orderly way.\u201cCovid has presented a remarkably convenient excuse, but also a very shallow one,\u201d Richardson said. \u201cBut what efforts have gone into considering alternatives to postponing the elections for a year?\u201dThe disqualified candidates included prominent activists such as Joshua Wong, political newcomers including a former journalist and organizers of pro-democracy protests. Reasons cited included opposition to government policies and an opinion piece written by Wong in The Washington Post. The candidates, officials said, could not be trusted to uphold the Basic Law, Hong Kong\u2019s mini-constitution.ADAD\u201cClearly, this is the largest electoral fraud in Hong Kong\u2019s history,\u201d Wong said in a tweet.The reasons cited by the government, Dapiran added, show that the national security law has in effect been much broader than expected, since it can now be used to disqualify anyone who does not explicitly support it.\u201cThey are using the law to essentially find any pretense to outlaw political opposition wholesale, and disqualify as many as they can,\u201d he said. \u201cIt now seems like any pretense of democracy has been taken away.\u201d\n\nTiffany Liang in Hong Kong and Loveday Morris in Berlin contributed to this report.With virus flip-flops, Hong Kongers ponder whether their leaders are out to lunchHong Kong was a pandemic poster child.

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said earlier this month that the U.S. was considering banning TikTok.These national-security worries parallel a broader U.S. security crackdown on Chinese companies, including telecom providers Huawei and ZTE. The Trump administration has ordered that the U.S. stop funding equipment from those providers in U.S. networks.  It has also tried to steer allies away from Huawei because of worries about the Chinese government\u2019s access to data, which the companies have denied it has.ADThe Trump administration has stepped in before to block or dissolve deals on national-security concerns, including stopping Singapore\u2019s Broadcom from its $117 billion bid for U.S. chipmaker Qualcomm in 2018 in an effort to help retain U.S. leadership in the telecom space. It also told China\u2019s Beijing Kunlun Tech Co. to sell off its 2016 purchase of gay dating app Grindr.ADOther countries are also taking action against TikTok.

Subscribe today.arrow-rightJuly 25The New York Times on political conventions and President Donald Trump canceling the Republican National Committee\u2019s nominating convention in Florida:President Trump announced on Thursday that, in deference to the pandemic, he was canceling the portion of the Republican National Committee\u2019s nominating convention scheduled to take place in Jacksonville, Fla., late next month.\u201cWe won\u2019t do a big, crowded convention, per se \u2014 it\u2019s not the right time for that,\u201d the president said during his daily coronavirus briefing, noting that he \u201cfelt it was wrong\u201d to have hordes of people heading into \u201ca hot spot.\u201d Mr. Trump added he\u2019d told his advisers, \u201cThere\u2019s nothing more important in our country than keeping our people safe.\u201dADBetter late than never.ADMr. Trump\u2019s coronation party originally was planned for Charlotte, N.C., which is where much of the convention\u2019s official business will still take place. In June, however, the president relocated all the flashy bits, including his acceptance speech, to Florida, after North Carolina officials refused to guarantee him the overcrowded, non-socially distanced spectacle he wanted.Florida, however, is now in the throes of a Covid-19 spike. The state reported on Thursday 10,249 new cases and 173 deaths, a record. Bringing thousands of conventiongoers into the mix would have been a recipe for more tragic outcomes.Instead of an arena full of cheering fans, Mr. Trump must content himself with \u201ctele-rallies,\u201d other virtual events and maybe some smaller gatherings. This is surely a bitter pill for the president, who draws energy from large, adoring crowds. But this moment of crisis also provides his party \u2014 both parties, for that matter \u2014 with an opportunity to reimagine and reshape their conventions into something more engaging and possibly more relevant to the American public.ADADThe convention of conventions is overdue for an overhaul. Why not make necessity the mother of reinvention?Much of what goes on at national conventions is not meant for consumption by the general public. Once upon a time, serious nominating business was conducted at these gatherings, but those days are gone. And for all the quadrennial chatter about the possibility of a brokered convention, the parties knock themselves out to avoid that kind of drama, even in cycles with ugly primaries.Nowadays, conventions are in large part extended reunions, awash in booze, food, music and elbow rubbing between elected officials, lobbyists, activists, operatives, celebrities, fund-raisers, journalists and other players. They are, in some ways, politics at its swampiest.ADThe parts produced for at-home viewers are dominated by speeches \u2014 many of them boring, vapid or even frightening, with an eye toward whipping up the party faithful. The lineups typically feature political stars, up-and-comers the party wants to spotlight (Barack Obama in 2004, Bill Clinton in 1988) and members of Congress. Former primary rivals often appear as a show of party unity, and members of the nominee\u2019s family are trotted out. Then there are the celebrities brought in for a dash of pizazz, like Meryl Streep, will.i.am and Katy Perry. (Such appearances don\u2019t always go over as planned, as when Clint Eastwood conducted a much-mocked chat with an empty chair at the 2012 Republican convention.)ADThere has got to be a better way.As it happens, Democrats have been working on this issue for some time, having realized several weeks ago that they needed to shift to a largely virtual gathering. The fine-tuning is still in progress, but some details are available. Airtime will be slashed and the speaking lineup shortened, Joe Solmonese, the chief executive of this year\u2019s convention, told the editorial board. \u201cWe want to be concise and respect people\u2019s time.\u201dADThe proceedings will also be more geographically dispersed. Delegates and public officials aren\u2019t gathering in the host city of Milwaukee. Joe Biden will deliver his speech from there, and his vice-presidential pick will be on site for part of the week. But many speakers will be scattered across battleground states and other meaningful locales, based on each evening\u2019s theme.AD\u201cWe\u2019re going to be very much grounded in the moment we\u2019re in,\u201d said Mr. Solmonese. \u201cSo when it comes time to talk about education and the tough decisions parents will make about their kids going back to school, we\u2019re going to go to the places those conversations are happening.\u201d The same holds for the public health responders dealing with Covid-19 and the small businesses fighting for survival, he said, noting that having to think beyond the convention location \u201ccreates an opportunity for us to go where we think there are important stories to be told.\u201dWith a nod to social distancing, the stage will feature a multiscreen Zoom layout on which political V.I.P.s and regular Americans will participate in a remote roll call vote. Dreamers and union members and activists will chime in from \u201ciconic or message-based locations in 57 states and territories across America,\u201d according to an internal party memo obtained by The Daily Beast. These will include the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Ala., the site of the Bloody Sunday civil rights clash in 1965.ADUsing resonant locations and nonfamous faces to spotlight important issues is a smart move. Message: This election is not about partisan games or insiders\u2019 egos. It is about the nation\u2019s collective future.ADAs for the themes conveyed, anything that focuses on comforting and healing the nation is likely to play well in these unsettling times \u2014 and speaks to Mr. Biden\u2019s particular brand. For nonincumbents, conventions are about introducing the nominee to voters. There will, of course, be gauzy videos telling Mr. Biden\u2019s life story. Cutting down on the speechifying and focusing on real people\u2019s stories is also less likely to put viewers to sleep.The Republicans and Mr. Trump are facing a slightly different challenge \u2014 with significantly less time to adapt. At this point, most Americans already have a clear view of the president. He will not be introducing himself to the nation so much as he will be attempting to rebrand himself.ADWith his polls numbers slipping, it\u2019s clear Mr. Trump needs a retool. For starters, he could drop the self-pitying talk about how unfair everyone has been to him and make a positive case for why he deserves to be re-elected. Central to this: He needs to articulate his vision and priorities for a second term. The president has been asked this question repeatedly of late, and he has consistently failed to offer a coherent answer. A (virtual) convention celebrating his renomination seems the obvious place to correct that.ADPageantry and celebrities have their place. Who doesn\u2019t love a good balloon drop? But this year, the entire nation is under enormous strain. Americans want to know that the presidential contenders understand and care about their problems \u2014 and, more than that, that they are focused intently on how to solve those problems.Online: https://www.nytimes.com/AD___July 28The Seattle Times on a judge ordering journalist to turn over unpublished content, including photos, to police:A King County judge\u2019s order that The Seattle Times and other media must turn over unpublished content to the police is a blow to independent journalism.The order imperils journalists documenting this summer\u2019s historic protests and sends the wrong message about the media as a check on government power.Journalists\u2019 unique role and responsibility is protected in Washington\u2019s shield law, passed by legislators in 2007. The law prohibits officials from forcing journalists to turn over unpublished information outside of specific and narrow circumstances. King County Superior Court Judge Nelson Lee\u2019s recent order that The Seattle Times and four other news outlets must hand unpublished protest video and photos to police investigators is a troubling interpretation of that law.ADADPolice want the journalists\u2019 images to help identify suspects who set fire to police cars and stole police firearms during a May 30 protest in downtown Seattle. Certainly, those involved in the crimes should be held accountable. But even the mistaken conflation of journalists with police investigators can directly impact news gatherers\u2019 ability to do their work.In volatile situations like recent protests, this misconception can \u2014 and has \u2014 led to physical violence.As the National Press Photographers Association and Press Freedom Defense Fund wrote in a joint statement about Lee\u2019s decision, \u201cIt is dangerous enough for visual journalists to be covering the COVID-19 pandemic and the protests over the death of George Floyd. The last thing visual journalists want is to be seen as an arm of law enforcement, aiding attempts to gather evidence.\u201dADAs Seattle Times assistant managing editor Danny Gawlowski wrote in a declaration submitted to the court, even before the court ruling, Times photo journalists have had to repeatedly explain their independence to protesters. During one early protest, a Times staff photographer was hit in the head by a rock and punched in the face.The U.S. Press Freedom Tracker has verified more than 585 incidents of journalists being assaulted, arrested or otherwise prevented from reporting during this summer\u2019s protests in dozens of cities.Independence from political and commercial influence is the backbone of responsible journalism. Journalists must report in the public interest, not in the service of government.Journalists are facing enormous challenges as they report this historic moment. The court\u2019s decision threatens to make a bad situation worse.Online: https://www.seattletimes.com/___July 28The Los Angeles Times on a new coronavirus relief package:At the moment, Congress has two tasks more important than any others: Providing the resources and leadership needed to defeat the COVID-19 pandemic, and helping the country climb out of the deep recession that the pandemic triggered. Sadly, the long-awaited coronavirus relief package that Senate Republicans released this week falls far short on both fronts.The need for a fourth major congressional effort became clear not long after states abandoned their stay-at-home orders, leading infection rates to skyrocket. The one thing lawmakers should have been able to agree on immediately is a major increase in funding for testing and contact tracing so that states could better identify where and how the disease was spreading. But in addition to being many days late, Senate Republicans are coming to the table many dollars short on this front. Its proposal includes $16 billion for testing, compared to the $75 billion recommended by a number of healthcare analysts and public health experts.There is nothing more important to people\u2019s lives and livelihoods than corralling the novel coronavirus. Now is not the time for parsimony.The GOP package\u2019s efforts to boost the economy are similarly halfhearted, starting with the proposal to renew the higher unemployment benefits that Congress authorized in March at a significantly lower level: an additional $200 per week instead of $600. The $200 would lapse at the end of September, after which the additional payment would raise unemployed workers\u2019 benefits to 70% of their previous wages (state benefits currently replace 40% to 50% of an idled worker\u2019s wages).The $600 add-on expires this week. Republicans balked at extending it because, they argued, it discouraged laid-off people from returning to work. The federal aid did allow most unemployment workers to make as much as or more than they\u2019d been paid in their last job, but it\u2019s far from clear that masses of Americans were turning down offers of work in defiance of state requirements. To the contrary, employment data from June showed that millions of laid-off Americans did take jobs, but also that there were far more unemployed people than there were jobs available. You can\u2019t take a job that doesn\u2019t exist.Also hugely problematic: It will take months to upgrade the antiquated unemployment systems in many states to make the change the Senate GOP has proposed, which makes it all but unachievable. The operational costs of those systems, by the way, are largely the federal government\u2019s responsibility.The extra benefits allowed millions of idled workers to pay their bills, boosting the consumer spending that is the lifeblood of the U.S. economy. The total was about $75 billion a month, economist Gus Faucher of PNC said, adding, \u201cIf you take that out of people\u2019s pockets, they\u2019re going to stop spending it.\u201dContinuing those extra benefits is a much more efficient way to pump money into the economy than cutting low- and middle-income families a check, as Congress did in March and the GOP proposes to do again.The package includes badly needed aid for schools but ignores the plight of state and local governments hard hit by the recession, setting the stage for more layoffs and cuts in vital government services. It also seeks to boost businesses through more federal loans for small businesses, an effort that, while good in concept, has been marred by poor targeting and execution.One other piece is a proposal to make businesses immune to COVID-19-related lawsuits until October 2024, retroactive to last December. It is strikingly one-sided, completely excusing companies and institutions from liability for negligent acts that spread the disease. They\u2019d even be shielded from liability for gross negligence if they made \u201creasonable\u201d efforts to comply with vague governmental guidelines.Any liability shield should either come with an alternate way for injured people to seek compensation from the government, as is the case with vaccines, or with specific standards that companies must meet for protecting their workers and customers from COVID-19. Besides, contrary to the proposal\u2019s ominous warnings, there\u2019s been no \u201ctidal wave\u201d of lawsuits from consumers; according to a complaint tracker by the Hunton Andrews Kurth law firm, consumers have filed fewer than a dozen COVID-19 related claims in the past month and a half, despite the broad move to reopen businesses.Some Republicans have balked at the idea of providing any further federal aid because of the record-setting deficit. Such fiscal responsibility would have been more welcome when the economy was growing and the GOP was cutting taxes and throwing money at the Pentagon. The human and economic problems caused by COVID-19 are enormous and ongoing, and they demand a commensurate response.Online: https://www.latimes.com/___July 28The Washington Post on aid packages for child care services and child caretakers:With schools shuttered and child-care options restricted, working parents across the country are shouldering unexpected child-care burdens. Many will not be able to return to work until they can find safe, affordable child care. At the same time, the child-care industry is collapsing under pandemic-inflicted financial pressure. Without swift action from Congress, child-care centers are at risk of permanent closures that could severely undermine the country\u2019s economic recovery.Unlike public schools, child-care centers are largely funded by parents\u2019 tuition payments. Even before the pandemic, most child-care centers were barely profitable. At the peak of the crisis, one-third of the child-care workforce lost their jobs, and about 60 percent of child-care programs temporarily closed. Now, those that survive are implementing virus prevention measures that reduce enrollment \u2014 and revenue \u2014 while increasing operating costs. Half the industry is at risk for permanent closure, which would mean millions of lost child-care slots, according to an estimate from the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank.Such losses would present many parents with terrible choices. In the absence of safe, affordable child care, should parents place their children in unlicensed or lower-quality facilities during a public health crisis, or spend more than they can reasonably afford on child care for those lucky enough to have a safe option nearby? For lower-income families, the lack of affordable child care could mean giving up work outside the home and sliding into poverty. Black and brown parents are more likely than white parents to experience job disruptions due to child care.Democrats and Republicans in Congress both have introduced measures that would help stabilize the industry. The Democratic-backed Child Care Is Essential Act would provide $50 billion in funding to child-care centers through the Child Care and Development Block Grant (CCDBG), which provides federal funding to states to subsidize child care for working families. The Republican-backed measure would fund child-care providers through the CCDBG for up to nine months. Experts estimate that the child-care industry needs $9.6 billion a month to stay afloat, much more than the $3.5 billion the industry received in spring\u2019s coronavirus legislation.To prevent mass closures of child-care providers, Congress must prioritize industry-wide relief. But even an emergency rescue would not address the underlying issues associated with the chronic underfunding of caregiving. Last week, former vice president Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, unveiled a proposal to invest $775 billion over 10 years in caregiving programs for small children, older Americans and those with disabilities. This ambitious proposal is a welcome and unprecedented acknowledgment that caregiving is central to a fully functioning economy. Though it is largely focused on bolstering America\u2019s caregiving infrastructure in the medium term, Mr. Biden\u2019s plan also mentions fiscal relief to keep child-care services running \u2014 a recognition that, without stabilization efforts now, there may not be an industry left to bolster.Online: https://www.washingtonpost.com/___July 28The Japan News on the relationship between the United States and China:The escalating confrontation between the United States and China, the world\u2019s two largest economies, could further destabilize the international situation. Both countries should realize their heavy responsibilities and stop the chain of retaliation.The United States has shut down the Chinese Consulate General in Houston, Texas, in the southwestern part of the country, on the ground that it was used as a \u201chub of Chinese spying.\u201dAs a countermeasure, China has closed the U.S. Consulate General in Chengdu, Sichuan Province, and claimed that some personnel at the consulate general were \u201cconducting activities not in line with their identities.\u201dThe role of a consulate general is to protect its own country\u2019s citizens, be aware of the situation in the country where it is located and engage in dialogue and exchange with the host country. However, taking advantage of a Vienna Convention article on the inviolability of foreign diplomatic missions, major powers often engage in intense intelligence-gathering activities.There are many cases in which a diplomat who is believed to be a spy is deported. However, it is unusual for a country to close a diplomatic mission of another country without specifying concrete illicit activities of that country. This can be regarded as a serious aspect of the confrontation between the United States and China.The practice of using the closure of diplomatic missions as a sanction must not spread to other countries and hamper legitimate diplomatic activities.The United States has made it clearer that it will step up pressure on China. Based on a ruling in 2016 by an international tribunal at The Hague, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said that China\u2019s claims of maritime interests in the South China Sea were \u201ccompletely illegal.\u201dIn his policy speech on China, Pompeo stated that engagement with China by past U.S. administrations that aimed to incorporate China into the international community had been a failure, and called for a change in the engagement policy. He also stressed the need for democratic countries to unite to contain China.It cannot be denied that the administration of Chinese President Xi Jinping has not listened to warnings from the international community, and has taken measures that ignored the rule of law, trade rules and human rights. It is pressing ahead with its militarization in the South China Sea, as well as breaking an international promise and depriving Hong Kong of its freedom and threatening the world order.It is understandable that the United States is trying to change China\u2019s behavior. The question is how and when.As opportunities for dialogue between the United States and China have been reduced due to the spread of the novel coronavirus, continued retaliatory battles could escalate tensions and develop into an unforeseen conflict. If the United States takes excessive hard-line measures, it will not be able to win the support of Japan and European countries.Suspicions still linger that U.S. President Donald Trump is showing a confrontational attitude toward China in order to strengthen his support for the presidential election in November. The Xi administration also is apparently being forced to take a hard-line attitude toward the United States to avoid domestic criticism of a \u201csoft attitude\u201d and maintain its prestige.Both the United States and China must regain their composure and find ways to settle the situation.Online: https://the-japan-news.com/___July 27The Wall Street Journal on weekend police brutality protests:Riots broke out again this weekend from coast to coast, with violence and vandalism damaging more of urban America. Democrats and their media allies insist these are largely peaceful protests, so it\u2019s worth examining what really happened.On Saturday in Seattle, protesters gathered outside the juvenile court and detention facility, set fire to portable trailers, and smashed the windows of nearby cars and businesses. An explosive device gashed an eight-inch hole in the side of the Seattle Police Department\u2019s East Precinct, and rioters threw fireworks, stones and other projectiles at law enforcement.\u201cIn all 59 officers were injured throughout the day with one of those being hospitalized,\u201d the police department reported, and \u201cinjuries ranged from abrasions and bruising to burns and a torn meniscus.\u201dSimilar scenes unfolded in Portland as rioters tried to tear down the fence surrounding the Hatfield Federal Courthouse. Demonstrators threw Molotov cocktails Friday night, and after midnight one federal officer took \u201ca direct hit from a commercial grade firework,\u201d another \u201cwas hit with a mortar firework,\u201d and a third \u201cwas struck in the head with a mortar firework,\u201d the Department of Homeland Security says. Peaceful?DHS says some 5,000 or 6,000 returned to the scene on Sunday, threw smoke bombs and launched \u201ca roughly 10-minute-long continuous firework attack against the courthouse.\u201d DHS says at least 20 federal officers sustained injuries in Portland.In Louisville, Ky., a black militia that calls itself the \u201cNot F\u2014 Around Coalition\u201d lived up to its name Saturday when a member discharged a gun and accidentally struck three compatriots, causing non-life-threatening injuries. In Oakland, Calif., rioters set fires downtown Saturday night, including at the Alameda County Superior Courthouse. In New York City, demonstrators defaced police vans with spray paint and tried to smash their windows, while others lit trash cans on fire. Demonstrators carried out more vandalism at a federal building in Atlanta and a Fraternal Order of Police lodge in Baltimore.This list isn\u2019t exhaustive, and it undermines the claim that the Trump Administration has deployed federal agents to suppress peaceful dissent. Federal officers protecting federal property are now the targets of demonstrators, not the instigators of violence. The real blame lies with progressive city leaders, who have all but promised violent protesters that they can act with impunity.Portland recently imposed sweeping restrictions on when police can use tear gas to disperse protesters. Seattle passed a similar ordinance banning tear gas, blast balls and other less-than-lethal weapons\u2014even after Police Chief Carmen Best warned that such restrictions leave officers with \u201cno ability to safely intercede to preserve property in the midst of a large, violent crowd\u201d and may \u201ccreate even more dangerous circumstances for our officers to intervene using what they have left\u2014riot shields and riot batons.\u201dFederal Judge James Robart issued an injunction against the Seattle ordinance last week after the federal government expressed similar concerns, but it\u2019s only temporary. Other Democratic-run cities have passed or are pursuing similar bans.The weekend\u2019s events were a deliberate assault on public and private property, law enforcement, and public order. Lawlessness begets lawlessness, and in recent weeks we\u2019ve seen reports of vigilantes and far-right activists joining the melee from Richmond to Philadelphia. Local officials are allowing this disorder to occur, and the more it is indulged the worse it is likely to get.Online: https://www.wsj.com/Copyright 2020 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Subscribe today.arrow-rightYet the vast fleet is in international waters, outside a maritime border around the Galapagos and also outside coastal waters off Ecuador, which controls the archipelago. That means the fleet, one of the biggest seen in years off South America\u2019s Pacific coast, is likely to fish with minimal monitoring until its holds are full.The Chinese fleet is \u201cvery close\u201d to the edge of the exclusive economic zone around the Galapagos, which extends 200 nautical miles (370 kilometers) from the archipelago, said its governor, Norman Wray. He said that, because of overfishing in recent years, \u201cwhat we\u2019re seeing is that each time fewer species return to the Galapagos.\u201dADADLuis Villanueva, an officer with the Pew Bertarelli Ocean Legacy Project, said Thursday that it was possible, though unproven, that long fishing lines from the Chinese vessels could be drifting into the exclusive economic zone. The fleet is a huge logistical undertaking, with storage and supply vessels that allow it to stay at sea for long periods.The fleet has drawn the attention of the United States, whose relationship with China is fraught on many fronts. The U.S. National Security Council tweeted that the U.S. stands with Ecuador \u201cagainst any aggression directed toward their economic and environmental sovereignty.\u201dChina maintains that it is a \u201cresponsible fishing nation\u201d with a \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy toward illegal fishing. The Chinese Embassy in Quito said in a July 23 statement that China respects Ecuador\u2019s measures to protect the environment and preserve marine resources.ADADChina had ascertained and confirmed with Ecuador\u2019s navy that all the Chinese fishing vessels are operating legally \u201cand don\u2019t represent any threat for anyone,\u201d the embassy said.Despite the Chinese statement, Ecuador has expressed concern through diplomatic channels and its navy is on alert for any incursion into Ecuadorian waters. In 2017, 20 crew members of a Chinese boat were jailed after Ecuador seized the vessel in the marine reserve of the Galapagos and discovered large numbers of sharks on board.Ecuador\u2019s foreign minister, Luis Gallegos, said the fishing fleet includes Liberian- and Panamanian-flagged boats, and that Ecuador seeks deeper coordination with Colombia, Panama, Peru and Chile on protecting the eastern tropical Pacific.ADChina\u2019s \u201cdistant-water\u201d fishing fleet is the biggest in the world and comprises a total of about 17,000 vessels, with about 1,000 of those registered in other countries, according to a June report by ODI, a London-based research group.ADThe fleet\u2019s \u201cvessel ownership is highly fragmented among many small companies\u201d and it is unclear whether the Chinese government has a clear picture of its complex control structure, the report said. It said other countries are involved in the world\u2019s overfishing crisis but that China is the most significant factor.The U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization said in June that about one-third of fish stocks are being fished at \u201cbiologically unsustainable levels.\u201dADLuis Su\u00e1rez, vice president and executive director of Conservation International in Ecuador, said there are suspicions, so far unconfirmed, that the Chinese fleet is being aided by South American associates because it is so far from home. For example, they could be selling it fuel, he said.Villanueva said fishing pressure around the Galapagos will only increase as climate change warms oceans and creates a more abundant catch around the archipelago in comparison to other regions.\u201cMore and more fleets will be interested in that area,\u201d he said.___Torchia reported from Mexico City.Copyright 2020 The Associated Press.

Subscribe today.arrow-rightAmbassador Liu Xiaoming\u2019s presentation stressed that China\u2019s actions in Xinjiang were meant to fight terrorism, and the grainy images he played for reporters included bloody scenes showing the aftermath of attacks.The videos were meant to counter a recent BBC interview in which presenter Andrew Marr had challenged the diplomat to explain drone footage that apparently showed Uighur prisoners being guarded and transferred to trains by Chinese authorities.ADLiu denied Uighurs were being mistreated and posted screen grabs that challenged, among other things, whether the prisoners were kneeling or sitting on the ground. He described \u201cso-called victims\u201d of human rights violations as being either separatists or \u201cactors trained by anti-China forces in the U.S. and other Western countries.\u201dAD\u201cThere are so many fallacies and lies that permeate Western media,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cIt can be called the lies of the century.\u201dThe rising tensions come as U.S. President Donald Trump and his administration push Washington and Beijing toward a new era of ever-growing confrontation.The U.S. government last week imposed trade sanctions on 11 companies it says are implicated in human rights abuses. The sanctions upped U.S. pressure on Beijing over Xinjiang, where the ruling Communist Party is accused of mass detentions, forced labor, forced birth control and other abuses against Muslim minorities.ADLiu added that disputes over human rights, the imposition of a new security law in Hong Kong and Britain\u2019s decision to ban Chinese tech giant Huawei from taking part in building a new high speed phone network had \u201cseriously poisoned the atmosphere\u201d of China\u2019s relations with Britain.\u2019\u2019AD\u201cChina and U.K. should have enough wisdom and capability to manage and deal with these differences, rather than allowing anti-China forces and Cold War warriors to kidnap (the) China-U.K. relationship,\u2019\u2019 he said.The United States has lobbied its allies to shun Huawei, because it says the Chinese government could use the company\u2019s technology to spy on Western nations. Huawei denies the allegations and argues that U.S. protectionism is behind the move.ADBritain in recent weeks also suspended an extradition treaty with Hong Kong and offered refuge for millions of eligible Hong Kongers who feel threatened by Beijing\u2019s tightening grip on the semi-autonomous city. Liu reiterated his previous comment that Britain should stop meddling in Hong Kong.\u201cChina respects U.K. sovereignty and has never interfered in the U.K.\u2019s internal affairs,\u2019\u2019 the ambassador said. \u201cIt is important the U.K. will do the same - namely, respect China\u2019s sovereignty and stop interfering in Hong Kong\u2019s affairs, which are China\u2019s internal affairs, so as to avoid further damage to the China-UK relationship.\u201dADLiu hammered the point that the U.K. and its people needed to think independently of the hawkish signals coming from the Trump administration. He said Britain was at a \u201ccritical historical juncture\u201d in how it wanted to treat China.AD\u201cIt\u2019s our hope that the U.K. would resist the pressure and coercion from a certain country and provide an open, fair, transparent and non-discriminatory environment for Chinese investment so as to bring back the confidence of Chinese businesses in the U.K,\u201d he said.Earlier this month, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo visited London and applauded British Prime Minister Boris Johnson for the decision to bar Huawei from 5G and other responses to the challenges raised by China. Pompeo said the U.S. supports \u201cthose sovereign choices, we think, \u2018Well done.\u2019\u201dIn another sign of fraying relations, U.K. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab condemned the Hong Kong government\u2019s decision to disqualify 12 pro-democracy nominees from a September legislative election. Authorities said they failed to uphold the city\u2019s mini-constitution and pledge allegiance to Hong Kong and Beijing.\u201cIt is clear they have been disqualified because of their political views, undermining the integrity of \u2018one country, two systems\u2019 and the rights and freedoms guaranteed in the joint declaration and Hong Kong\u2019s basic law,\u201d Raab said.Copyright 2020 The Associated Press.

Keeping kids in cohorts throughout the school day. Enforcing strict handwashing requirements; disinfecting classroom surfaces every day. Ensuring that ventilation systems for classrooms are in good working order. Keeping children and teachers six feet apart in classrooms and during outdoor activities. Barring any activities in which students face each other.\u201cIn the absence of robust and rapid diagnostic testing for schools, the major tools for disease mitigation are personal (social) distancing, mask usage, strict hand hygiene, fomite prevention on surfaces (enhanced cleaning measures), and proper room ventilation,\" says the guidance, submitted by Paul Robinson, the chapter\u2019s president.\u00a0(Read his full 11-page letter here.)At least 17 of 21 states flagged as \u201cred zones\u201d in the latest internal report compiled for the White House coronavirus task force are apparently not following recommendations by federal authorities to slow the spread.\u00a0\u201cThe report, which is sent regularly to state officials but is not released to the public, categorizes states as green, yellow or red based on their levels of new cases and rate of tests coming back positive,\u201d Hannah Knowles reports. \u201cA state is designated a red zone if it reports more than 100 new cases per 100,000 people or if more than 10 percent of its virus tests come back positive.\u201dADADRep.

This proposed group would also include older adults, residents of long-term-care facilities and people with underlying medical conditions. A federal advisory panel that provides vaccine recommendations to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention presented an overview of the priority groups last month and met again Wednesday to discuss the issue. \u2026 U.S. officials have said that if a vaccine is shown to be effective, the first doses could be available by the end of the year. \u2026\u00a0ADAD\u201cThe overview of proposed priority groups laid out by the federal advisory panel includes subsets within those that should get the highest consideration.

Subscribe today.arrow-rightThe reported hacking comes at a time when the Vatican and Beijing are looking into extending a controversial agreement on the process of appointing Catholic bishops in China. That provisional deal, signed two years ago, was aimed at healing a decades-long rift between the Holy See and China and eliminating a system in which some Chinese bishops pledged loyalty to the state, others to the pope.The cybersecurity firm, Recorded Future, attributed the Chinese attack to a state-sponsored group named RedDelta. It said the group\u2019s attack continued until \u201cat least\u201d July\u00a021.ADAD\u201cThe suspected intrusion into the Vatican would offer RedDelta insight into the negotiating position of the Holy See ahead of the deal\u2019s September 2020 renewal,\u201d said Recorded Future, which released a report Tuesday on its findings.The cyberattack \u2014 which began in May, according to the report \u2014 marks the latest apparent attempt by Chinese hackers to monitor the activities of religious groups. China, for instance, has waged hacking campaigns against the Uighur minority within its own borders. But in this case, according to the firm, China\u2019s target was the seat of the Roman Catholic Church.The hackers also targeted the church\u2019s diocese and a study mission in Hong Kong, purportedly as a way to monitor the Vatican\u2019s views on protests in Hong Kong and on a new Chinese security law that has  granted Beijing sweeping powers over the city.ADADThe firm\u2019s findings were first reported by the New York Times.A Vatican spokesman did not respond to a request for comment. The church\u2019s systems have appeared vulnerable at least once in the past; the Vatican\u2019s website was disabled in 2012 for several hours by the hacking group Anonymous. The group said at the time that the attack was a response to crimes committed by clerics in the church\u2019s sexual abuse scandal.The Chinese Embassy in Rome declined to comment.The apparent infiltration by RedDelta showed many of the technical hallmarks of previous Chinese-backed efforts, the report said. One way hackers made inroads was by using a \u201clure document\u201d \u2014 a digitized letter, on Vatican letterhead, with a message from high-ranking Cardinal Pietro Parolin. The letter was addressed to Monsignor Javier Corona Herrera, an official in the Holy See\u2019s Hong Kong mission. The report said it was unclear whether the document was fabricated or legitimate; either way, hackers weaponized it with malware.ADAD\u201cGiven that the letter was directly addressed to this individual, it is likely that he was the target of a spearphishing attempt,\u201d the report said, referring to an attack on a specific target aimed at stealing sensitive information.One former high-ranking Italian intelligence official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive matter, said China\u2019s reported hacking efforts seemed plausible.\u201cThey use phishing expeditions to hack everything that can be hacked,\u201d the former intelligence official said. \u201cIt is a way to exert influence and exercise power.\u201dRelations between China and the Holy See hinge on what happens in the coming months, as their historic \u2014 but provisional \u2014 two-year diplomatic deal comes up for renewal. When it was signed in 2018, Pope Francis said the agreement would help \u201cheal the wounds of the past.\u201dThe deal, negotiated in fits and starts over three decades, essentially tried to apply rules about how Catholic bishops in China would be selected. Previously, bishops were appointed by the Chinese state without papal approval, while others, operating underground, swore allegiance to the pope. This led to a de facto split in Catholicism in China.ADADAs part of the 2018 deal, the Vatican agreed to lift the excommunication orders for seven bishops appointed by China without papal approval. In turn, Francis was allowed to have final say on bishop appointments.China and the Vatican severed diplomatic ties in 1951. Catholicism is one of the five official religions tolerated in China, but its followers are a stark minority \u2014 an estimated 10 to 12\u00a0million people in the country of nearly 1.4\u00a0billion.The 2018 deal has come under heavy criticism, particularly from Catholics in Hong Kong, who accuse the church of compromising its values and overlooking rights abuses by the Chinese government. In a Washington Post op-ed published in December, Cardinal Joseph Zen, bishop emeritus of Hong Kong, said the Vatican was following a line with China of \u201cappeasement at any cost.\u201dThis month, Vatican-watchers noted that Francis, speaking at St. Peter\u2019s Square, skipped over a passage in which he had been set to address Hong Kong. The Vatican has not offered an explanation of why Francis, who generally sticks to his prepared remarks, this time veered away.

But the president, still trying to fashion himself as an outsider, offers little detail about how he\u2019d pull the levers of government in a second term.Support our journalism. Subscribe today.arrow-rightBiden, for his part, sounds every bit the Democratic standard-bearer as he frames the federal government as the collective force to combat the coronavirus, rebuild the economy and address centuries of institutional racism and systemic inequalities. A veteran of national politics, Biden also loves framing his deal-making past as proof he can do it again from the Oval Office.ADADIt leaves Americans with an unambiguous choice. A look at where the rivals stand on key issues:ECONOMY, TAXESDecades-low unemployment and a soaring stock market were Trump\u2019s calling cards before the pandemic. While the stock market has clawed much of its way back after cratering in the early weeks of the crisis, unemployment stood at 11.1% in June, higher than the nadir of the Great Recession. There were still about 14.7 million fewer jobs last month than there were prior to the pandemic in February.Trump has predicted that the U.S. economy will rebound in the third and fourth quarters of this year and is set to take off like a \u201crocket ship\u201d in the new year, a prediction that bakes in the assumption that a coronavirus vaccine or effective therapeutics have hit the market that allow life to get back to normal. He\u2019s still advocating for a payroll tax cut, though such a measure faces stiff bipartisan opposition. Winning a second term \u2014 and a mandate from voters \u2014 might be his best hope at getting it through.ADADBiden pitches sweeping federal action as necessary to avoid an extended recession or depression and to address long-standing wealth inequality that disproportionately affects nonwhite Americans. His biggest-ticket plans: a $2 trillion, four-year push intended to eliminate carbon pollution in the U.S. energy grid by 2035 and a new government health insurance plan open to all working-age Americans (with generous subsidies). He proposes new spending on education, infrastructure and small businesses, along with raising the national minimum wage to $15 an hour.Biden would cover some but not all of the new costs by rolling back much of the 2017 GOP tax overhaul. He wants a corporate income tax rate of 28% (lower than before but higher than now) and broad income and payroll tax hikes for individuals with more than $400,000 of annual taxable income. All that would generate an estimated $4 trillion or more over 10 years. Biden frames immigration as an economic matter, as well. He wants to expand legal immigration slots and offer a citizenship path for about 11 million residents who are in the country illegally but who, Biden notes, are already economic contributors as workers and consumers.EDUCATIONADADTrump has used his push for schools to fully reopen this fall amid the pandemic as an opportunity to spotlight his support for charter schools and school choice.Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, a longtime proponent of charter schools and school voucher programs, has suggested that families be allowed to take federal money allotted to school districts that don\u2019t open and spend it in private schools that do open. For most of Trump\u2019s first term, his administration has sought major increases to federal charter school grant aid. But Congress has responded with relatively small increases.With higher education, Trump has repeatedly complained that campuses are beset by \u201cradical left indoctrination.\u201d He recently threatened to defund universities, saying that he was having the Treasury Department reexamine tax-exempt status and federal funding of unspecified schools.ADADBiden wants the federal government to partner with states to make public higher education tuition-free for any student in a household earning up to $125,000 annually. The assistance would extend to everyone attending two-year schools, regardless of income. He also proposes sharply increasing aid for historically Black colleges. His overall education plans carry a 10-year price tag of about $850 billion.He calls for universal access to prekindergarten programs for 3- and 4-year-olds; tripling Title I spending for schools with higher concentrations of students from low-income households; more support for non-classroom positions like on-campus social workers; federal infrastructure spending for public school buildings; and covering schools\u2019 costs to comply with federal disability laws. Biden also opposes taxpayer money being routed to for-profit charter school businesses, and he\u2019s pledged that his secretary of education will have classroom teaching experience.HEALTH CAREADADAs a candidate for the White House, Trump promised that he would \u201cimmediately\u201d replace President Barack Obama\u2019s health care law with a plan of his own that would provide \u201cinsurance for everybody.\u201d In the last leg of his first term, Americans are still waiting for Trump to make his big reveal. Trump officials say the administration has made strides by championing transparency on hospital prices, pursuing a range of actions to curb prescription drug costs and expanding lower-cost health insurance alternatives for small businesses and individuals. But those incremental steps are far short from the sweeping changes Trump had promised.Biden wants a \u201cMedicare-like public option\u201d to compete alongside private insurance markets for working-age Americans, while increasing premium subsidies that many working-class and middle-class workers use already under the Affordable Care Act. Biden estimates that would cost about $750 billion over 10 years. That positions Biden between Trump, who wants to scrap the 2010 law, and progressives who want a single-payer system to replace private insurance altogether. Biden sees his approach as the next step toward universal coverage and one he could get through Congress.CORONAVIRUSADADAfter months of insisting that the worst days of the pandemic have passed, Trump recently acknowledged that the pandemic may \u201cget worse before it gets better\u201d as many states \u2014 including several critical to his path to 270 Electoral College votes \u2014 have seen a surge in the virus.Trump is again holding regular briefings to directly get his message out on the virus and other matters. Trump believes that a key to economic recovery from the virus is fully reopening schools -\u2014 though Americans are wary. Only about 1 in 10 Americans think day care centers, preschools or K-12 schools should open this fall without restrictions, according to a recent poll by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs.Trump also says he\u2019s \u201cpretty damn certain\u201d that vaccines and therapeutics for the virus are coming in the not-so-distant future \u2014 a game changer as Americans and the world seek a glide path to normalcy. Congress approved about $3 trillion in coronavirus relief in March and April, and Democrats, Republicans and the White House are negotiating another significant round of funding. The package, however, won\u2019t include a payroll tax cut \u2014 something that Trump badly wanted but that Senate Democrats and even some Senate Republicans balked at including.ADADBiden draws some of his sharpest contrasts with Trump on the pandemic, arguing that the presidency and federal government exist for such crises. Trump, by contrast, has largely shifted responsibility to governors. Biden endorses generous federal spending to help businesses and individuals, along with state and local governments, deal with the financial cliffs of the pandemic slowdown. He\u2019s promised aggressive use of the Defense Production Act, the wartime law a president can use to direct certain private-sector activity. Additionally, Biden promises to elevate the government\u2019s scientists and physicians to communicate a consistent message to the public, and he would have the U.S. rejoin the World Health Organization. He\u2019s also willing to use executive power for a national mask mandate, even if its enforcement is questionable.TRADETrump views the signing of two major trade deals \u2014 an updated pact with Mexico and Canada and Phase 1 of a China agreement \u2014 as signature achievements of his presidency. U.S. and China signed Phase 1 in January, less than two months before the coronavirus pandemic put an enormous strain on U.S.-Sino relations. Trump says Phase 1 led to China buying roughly $200 billion over two years in U.S. agricultural products, energy and other American products. In return, the U.S. canceled planned U.S. tariffs on Chinese-made smartphones, toys and laptop computers. The U.S. also cut in half, to 7.5%, the tariff rate levied on $120 billion in other China imports.ADADPhase 2 of the deal is expected to focus on some tougher issues between the countries, including Trump\u2019s wish to get China to stop subsidizing its state-owned enterprises. But for Trump, who has come to frequently refer to the coronavirus as the \u201cChina virus,\u201d it remains to be seen whether he will be able to effectively reengage Beijing on trade. Trump recently said he\u2019s \u201cnot interested\u201d in presently talking to China.Biden has joined a growing bipartisan embrace of \u201cfair trade\u201d abroad \u2014 a twist on decades of \u201cfree trade\u201d talk as Republican and Democratic administrations alike expanded international trade. Biden wants to juice U.S. manufacturing by directing $400 billion of federal government purchases to domestic firms (part of that for buying pandemic supplies) over a four-year term. He wants $300 billion in new support for U.S. technology firms\u2019 research and development. Biden says the new domestic spending must come before he enters into any new international trade deals. He pledges tough negotiations with China, the world\u2019s other economic superpower, on trade and intellectual property matters. China, like the U.S., is not yet a member of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the multilateral trade agreement that Biden advocated for when he was vice president.FOREIGN POLICYDuring his first term, Trump built his foreign policy around the mantra of \u201cAmerica First.\u201d Besides the trade deals, he counts as major achievements building more than 200 miles (320 kilometers) of his promised wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, cajoling more NATO members to fulfill their pledge to spend 2% of GDP on defense spending and reducing the U.S. military footprint in Afghanistan and other hot spots. He also announced his intended withdrawal from the Paris climate accord.Trump can officially withdraw the U.S. from the Paris agreement \u2014 it sets the goal of holding global warming below 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit \u2014 as an example of an agreement that \u201cdisadvantages the United States to the exclusive benefit of other countries.\u201d The deal, which was signed by Obama, stipulates that no nation can leave until four years after they signed on. For the U.S., that\u2019s Nov. 4 \u2014 one day after the U.S. election.The president has also made clear his desire to leave Afghanistan sooner than the timeline laid out in the Feb. 29 peace agreement with the Taliban, which set the path for U.S. troops to leave the country in 12 to 14 months if the insurgent group met certain conditions. There are currently about 8,600 U.S. troops in Afghanistan.Trump also counts his engagement with North Korea\u2019s Kim Jong Un as a monumental achievement. The president has not been able to prod Kim to give up the nation\u2019s nuclear program, but he has met the autocrat twice for face-to-face talks.Biden says he\u2019d begin \u201cthe day after the election\u201d rebuilding relationships with allies ruffled by Trump\u2019s approach. Biden\u2019s top priority is reestablishing the foundations of NATO, the post-World War II alliance of Western powers that Biden said is necessary to counter Russia\u2019s aggressive, expansionist aims in eastern Europe and Asia. Biden said he\u2019d immediately confront Russian President Vladimir Putin about his country\u2019s interference in U.S. elections. Biden pledges to \u201cend forever wars\u201d but clarifies that U.S. special forces \u2014 as opposed to large-scale ground missions \u2014 remain a vital part of world stability. Biden frames immigration and combating the climate crisis as national security matters. He calls for rebuilding a decimated U.S. diplomatic corps, rejoining the Paris climate accord and pushing China and other large economies to reduce carbon pollution. On immigration, Biden calls for expanding legal immigration opportunities while reversing Trump\u2019s cuts to foreign aid programs intended to promote world stability and reduce migration.Copyright 2020 The Associated Press.

They equip themselves with makeshift protective gear, donning bicycle helmets, gas masks and goggles while wielding umbrellas as shields. Some have repurposed household tools like leafblowers to help against tear gas and other projectiles fired into the crowds. Others assemble ramshackle barricades and shine laser pointers to disrupt the scopes of the heavily armed security forces. Authorities brand them vandals and \u201crioters.\u201d But the crackdowns that ensued only galvanized further dissent.Support our journalism. Subscribe today.arrow-rightThat\u2019s how the script read for months of unrest that gripped Hong Kong last year. But it has also been on view in recent weeks in the West Coast city of Portland, Ore., the site of an intensifying showdown between demonstrators and the Trump administration. Over the weekend, Black Lives Matter protesters marched in cities across the country, from Los Angeles to Omaha to Seattle. In some instances, they clashed with police and federal security forces, leading to arrests.ADADPortland, though, has become ground zero of a new phase in the United States\u2019 summer of discontent. The city, as my colleagues noted, has \u201ca long tradition of protest as a subculture of anarchism.\u201d Petty street skirmishes there between far-right and anti-fascist groups have inflamed American social media in recent years. Their reelection prospects narrowing, President Trump and his Republican allies have seized upon the disturbances in the Pacific Northwest as a parable for what the American left supposedly has in store for the rest of the country. As a result, Portland has become the first battleground in an apparent nationwide surge of federal agents deployed to big cities with the White House\u2019s prodding \u2014 and without local approval.Senior administration officials \u201csaid the White House had long wanted to amplify strife in cities, encouraging [Department of Homeland Security] officials to talk about arrests of violent criminals in sanctuary cities and repeatedly urging [Immigration and Customs Enforcement] to disclose more details of raids than some in the agency were comfortable doing,\u201d my colleagues reported. \u201c\u2018It was about getting viral online content,\u2019 one of the officials said.\u201dHere, too, there are echoes of what transpired in Hong Kong. The autocratic regime in Beijing has moved to radically curtail Hong Kong\u2019s special freedoms, justifying its implementation of a new national security law on grounds that it will pacify a troubled city. \u201cWe just want to put our house in order,\u201d Wang Huiyao, president of the Center for China and Globalization, a Beijing-based think tank, told the Financial Times. \u201cSome countries may not see the benefits of this for the time being but they will see sooner or later a more prosperous Hong Kong and more stable China, which is of benefit to the whole world.\u201dADADAnalysts also argue that Chinese President Xi Jinping may be keen to stir hard-line sentiment among ordinary Chinese by cracking down on the troublesome former British colony. \u201cTaking strong action on Hong Kong stoked mainland Chinese nationalism at a time of declining economic growth and rising domestic frustrations over public health and safety,\u201d observed Ryan Hass of Brookings.But, as in Hong Kong, the heavy-handedness of security forces in U.S. cities has hardly calmed dissent. The sight of federal agents, some in unmarked uniforms, detaining protesters in Portland only led to greater howls of protest and a daily showdown outside a major federal courthouse. \u201cThe scenes of militarized federal forces on the city\u2019s streets have stunned many Americans and unnerved former Homeland Security officials, but they have not quieted the protests,\u201d my colleagues reported. \u201cIn many ways, the agents and the barricades they have erected have re-energized the demonstrators and have converted the courthouse into a proxy for the Trump administration itself.\u201dYellow-clad \u201cmoms\u201d took to the front lines. The mayor of Portland joined the throngs and got tear-gassed as a result. \u201cThis is a democracy, not a dictatorship,\u201d Oregon Gov. Kate Brown (D) said in a statement. \u201cWe cannot have secret police abducting people in unmarked vehicles. I can\u2019t believe I have to say that to the President of the United States.\u201dOf course, the echoes can grow fainter. Protesters in the United States aren\u2019t arrayed against a single-party dictatorship bent on snuffing out their waning political autonomy. At the same time, some Republican politicians who have cast demonstrations in the United States as the work of troublemakers or rioters, using language jarringly similar to that of Beijing and its proxies, have made themselves champions of Hong Kong\u2019s pro-democracy movement.ADADBut as Trump raises the stakes in the nation\u2019s cities, critics warn of the dangerous precedents he is setting. \u201cWe are watching the perfect and perhaps inevitable combination of a domestic-security superagency and a President who rejects all mechanisms of accountability, including the Senate confirmation process,\u201d wrote the New Yorker\u2019s Masha Gessen.\u201cFor decades, conservative activists and leaders have warned that \u2018jackbooted thugs\u2019 from the federal government were going to come to take away Americans\u2019 civil rights with no due process and no recourse,\u201d observed the Atlantic\u2019s David A. Graham. \u201cNow they\u2019re here \u2014 but they\u2019re deployed by a staunchly right-wing president with strong conservative support.\u201dIn Portland, some black activists fear the city\u2019s overwhelmingly white protest movement is shifting the focus from their historic grievances in Oregon. \u201cWe cannot let teargas and rubber bullets define the moment that we\u2019re in now,\u201d E.D. Mondain\u00e9, president of the Portland branch of the NAACP, told the Guardian. \u201cWe must seize the moment and assure the world that this time racism will no longer live.\u201dADADThe protests, meanwhile, don\u2019t look like they\u2019re about to fade. \u201cWe\u2019re buying motorcycle armor so we can go out there,\u201d Mac Smiff, a 39-year-old artist, told my colleagues last week. \u201cThis is not Fallujah, this is Portland, Oregon, and it\u2019s like war games out here.\u201dRead more: The U.S. ramps up its confrontation with ChinaDid Europe have its \u2018Hamiltonian\u2019 moment?

Hong Kong has recorded 3,273 infections as of Friday, more than double the tally on July 1.The government has tightened social distancing restrictions, limiting public gatherings to two people, and banned dining-in at restaurants after 6 p.m.ADThe lead-up to the elections had been closely watched after a national security law that took effect in late June stipulated that candidates who violated the law would be barred from running.The new law was seen as Beijing\u2019s attempt to curb dissent in the city after months of pro-democracy and anti-government protests rocked Hong Kong last year over a controversial \u2014 but now withdrawn \u2014 extradition bill that would allow suspects to be sent to the mainland for trial.ADThe monthslong protests plunged Hong Kong into its largest ever political crisis, with clashes between protesters and police turning violent at times. Over 8,000 people have been arrested in connection to the protests since June 2019.Dissatisfaction with the Hong Kong government helped the pro-democracy bloc achieve a landslide victory in district council elections last November, a momentum that the opposition was hoping to ride to gain a majority in the legislature.ADIn Washington, White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said Friday the Trump administration strongly disapproved of Hong Kong\u2019s decision to postpone the election.\u201cWe condemn the Hong Kong government\u2019s decision to postpone for one year its legislative council elections and to disqualify opposition candidates,\u201d McEnany said. \u201cThis action undermines the democratic processes and freedoms that have underpinned Hong Kong\u2019s prosperity and this is only the most recent in a growing list of broken promises by Beijing which promised autonomy and freedoms to the Hong Kong people until 2047 in the Sino-British joint declaration.\u201dADChina\u2019s foreign ministry insisted that Hong Kong\u2019s legislative elections are an \u201cinternal affair.\u201d\u201cIt is the responsibility of the Hong Kong SAR government to ensure that the elections for the 7th Legislative Council are held in a safe, orderly, fair and just environment,\u201d ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said Friday. \u201cWe believe that the Hong Kong SAR government will proceed from the current anti-epidemic situation in Hong Kong and handle relevant matters in accordance with the law.\u201dADOn Thursday, 12 pro-democracy candidates including prominent pro-democracy activist Joshua Wong were disqualified from running for not complying with the city\u2019s mini-constitution or pledging allegiance to the local and national governments.AD\u201cBeyond any doubt, this is the most scandalous election ever in Hong Kong history,\u201d Wong said at a news conference Friday. \u201cI wish to emphasize that no reasonable man would think that this election ban is not politically driven.\u201d\u201cBeijing has staged multiple acts to prevent the opposition bloc from taking the majority in the Hong Kong legislature,\u201d he said.Germany, which currently holds the European Union\u2019s rotating 6-month presidency, said it was suspending its extradition agreement with Hong Kong to protest the decision to postpone the elections and disqualify the candidates.AD\u201cWe have repeatedly made clear our expectations that China will comply with its obligations under international law,\u201d German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said. \u201cThis includes protecting the freedoms and rights guaranteed in the Basic Law, and this includes the right to free and fair elections.\u201dADThe postponement also drew criticism from the New York-based group Human Rights Watch.\u201cPostponing the September elections for a year is a cynical move to contain a political emergency, not a public health one.

He said \u201ccommon sense\u201d guides his concern that U.S. adversaries might flood the election with phony ballots submitted by mail, even though election officials say safeguards such as bar codes and signature verification prevent this.\u00a0It was the first time a congressional committee scrutinized Barr's claims in person \u2013 and Democrats savaged him, contending that he and the president were spreading conspiracy theories and aiding U.S. enemies.\u00a0ADAD\u201cThe FBI and our intelligence services have repeatedly warned that [U.S.] adversaries are actively trying to sow mistrust of our election system and by repeating disinformation about mail-in voting, you and the president are helping them,\u201d said Rep. Mary Gay Scanlon (D-Pa.), vice chair of the committee.Barr did break from the president, however, when asked if he believed the election will be rigged. \u201cI have no reason to believe it will be,\u201d Barr said.\u00a0The mail-voting fight is playing out amid a broader partisan battle over how to run the general election.\u00a0Democrats have routinely pushed for a surge in funding to protect the elections from hacking by Russia and other adversaries and more recently to fund voting by mail, expanded early voting and safety measures to reduce the spread of the coronavirus at polling places. But they\u2019ve faced stiff opposition from Republicans including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.). Some $400 million was allocated in the first coronavirus relief bill passed in March, which many states insist is not nearly enough to make the changes needed to help voters cast their ballots safely in a pandemic.\u00a0ADADA $3 trillion coronavirus relief bill passed by the Democratic-controlled House committed another $3.6 billion for elections \u2013 while a $1 trillion bill released by Senate Republicans this week contained no money at all. Republicans have also balked at Democratic efforts to impose new mandates on states including that all voters who want to cast mail ballots in future elections can do so.\u00a0Complicating the argument: Barr acknowledged during the hearing that he has voted by mail himself.\u00a0But he insisted mail voting concerns don\u2019t apply when a smaller number of people who aren\u2019t able to make it to the polls in person vote that way.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ve made very clear I\u2019m not talking about accommodations to people who have to be out of state or have some particular inability to go and vote,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat I\u2019m talking about is the wholesale conversion of an election to by mail voting.\u201dADADThat explanation echoes President Trump, who has repeatedly attacked mail voting even though he also voted by mail this year.\u00a0But the explanation bears little resemblance to the way states actually run their mail-voting programs. Both Virginia, where Barr voted by mail, and Florida, where Trump voted by mail, have long allowed any resident to vote that way without providing any excuse. The only difference this year will be that many more residents will choose to vote by mail because they fear contracting the coronavirus if they vote in person.\u00a0There are no states that have announced plans to convert entirely to mail voting during the general election.

It also asks for internal department emails about responding to Congress. The committee says Pompeo had delivered more than 16,000 pages of records to the Senate but refused to send the same materials to the Democrat-led House.ADAD\u201cSecretary Pompeo has turned the State Department into an arm of the Trump campaign and he\u2019s not even trying to disguise it,\u201d Engel said in a statement announcing the subpoena, which demands the materials by next week.The subpoena represents another escalation in an election-year battle between Democrats and the GOP Senate committees investigating Hunter Biden. Democrats have criticized Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee Chair Ron Johnson, R-Wis., in particular for his probe of Hunter Biden and the gas company Burisma. They say Johnson\u2019s probe is amplifying Russian propaganda, an accusation he denies.There is no evidence of wrongdoing by the Bidens, and Hunter Biden has denied using his influence with his father to aid Burisma.ADHouse and Senate Democratic leaders sent a letter to FBI Director Christopher Wray last month, saying they are concerned that Congress appears to be the target of a \u201cconcerted foreign interference campaign\u201d to influence the 2020 presidential election. The letter, which did not mention Johnson or his committee by name, asked Wray for an all-members, classified briefing on the matter before the August recess.ADWray hasn\u2019t yet offered the requested briefing, but lawmakers did receive a classified briefing early Friday on general election security. Leaving that meeting, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said she is concerned \u201cthe American people should be better informed.\u201dThe president\u2019s efforts to have Ukraine investigate Hunter Biden\u2019s role as a board member for Burisma were at the heart of House Democrats\u2019 impeachment probe last year. Trump asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to investigate the Bidens on a July 2019 phone call that was later revealed by a whistleblower\u2019s complaint.ADThe House impeached Trump in December for pressuring the Ukrainian government to announce an investigation while withholding military aid to the country. The Senate acquitted him in February.The new efforts by Democrats come as the nation\u2019s intelligence agencies, congressional intelligence committees and Joe Biden have all warned of renewed election interference by Russia this year. Trump himself has been loath to discuss the subject or acknowledge that Russia tried to sow discord in the 2016 contest by hacking Democratic accounts and pushing out inflammatory content on social media.ADStill, his administration has warned that Russia and other countries will likely try again. In a statement last week, William Evanina, the government\u2019s chief counterintelligence official, said adversaries such as China, Russia and Iran are seeking to compromise U.S. private communications and infrastructure in campaigns. It also warned of disinformation campaigns on social media.ADDemocrats said the statement didn\u2019t go far enough, and have pushed for more information on the meddling to be public. They have also sought to bring attention to their apparent concerns about the Senate investigations while declining to talk in specifics because much of the information is classified.On Thursday, the House Intelligence Committee voted to make a classified attachment to the letter detailing their concerns about interference available for review by members of the House. In a transcript the committee released of that closed meeting, House Intelligence Committee Chair Adam Schiff said he has \u201cthe same concerns today\u201d as he did in 2016 that Russians were working to disrupt American elections.AD\u201cI believe today, as I did then, that any effort to interfere in elections must be deterred, disrupted, and exposed, because complacency will further erode the basic precept underlying our democracy, that Americans alone must decide American elections,\u201d Schiff said.ADAt the same meeting, Democrats asked the panel\u2019s top Republican, California Rep. Devin Nunes, whether he had received a package of information from Ukrainian lawmaker Andrii Derkach and whether he would share it with Democrats. Derkach is a member of Ukraine\u2019s parliament who has promoted unsubstantiated claims against the Bidens.Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney, D-N.Y., said \u201ccommittee staff is in possession of evidence that a package was received.\u201dAsked by Schiff if he would respond to Maloney\u2019s comment, Nunes said \u201cno.\u201dNunes said the Democrats\u2019 letter on election interference was a political exercise.He said the classified attachment \u201cfocuses entirely on Russia while ignoring potential election meddling by any other nations.\u201dCopyright 2020 The Associated Press.

He told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that threats from Russia against Americans in Afghanistan, Libya, Syria, Ukraine and elsewhere had been covered.Pompeo\u2019s testimony came a day after President Donald Trump told an interviewer he had not raised the bounty allegations in numerous phone calls with Russian President Vladimir Putin despite concerns about them from the intelligence community. Among the Russian officials, Pompeo said he has discussed threats generally with Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, as has the U.S. ambassador to Russia, John Sullivan.ADAD\u201cYes, I can assure you that each time I have spoken to Foreign Minister Lavrov, I have raised all of the issues that put any Americans at risk,\u201d Pompeo said in response to a question from the committee\u2019s top Democrat, Sen.

They have pointed to Trump\u2019s refusal to accept intelligence findings that Russia tried to help him win election in 2016, the president\u2019s willingness to praise Putin, and his efforts to condition vital military assistance to Ukraine on a political favor.Pompeo rejected those assertions.AD\u201cThis administration has acted to protect our interests and our friends,\u201d Pompeo said, adding that he and others would act to counter Russian attempts to meddle in the 2020 presidential election. \u201cWe\u2019re taking seriously the threats that the Russians will engage in disinformation campaigns.\u201dADPompeo said the administration is acting with sanctions and threats of such penalties to prevent Russia from completing the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which would carry natural gas to Europe, in particular Germany, and increase the continent\u2019s dependence on Moscow for fuel.\u201cWe want Europe to have real, secure, stable, safe energy resources that cannot be turned off in the event Russia wants to,\u201d he said.ADPompeo also took aim at China in his testimony, saying the administration was battling the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s efforts to expand its influence on multiple fronts.

Subscribe today.arrow-rightAfter more than three years of President Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d administration, that world is long gone.The average U.S. tariff on Chinese products is at its highest level in at least 40 years. The U.S. has abandoned the Obama administration\u2019s signature pact, the Trans-Pacific Partnership. And organized labor has muscled its way into greater prominence in shaping trade bargains.ADNavigating this landscape represents a challenge for Biden, who backed a 1994 trade deal with Mexico and subsequent legislation allowing China into the global trading system, both of which Trump and the Democratic left have long assailed. The president already is taking shots at his likely Democratic rival, accusing him in a television ad released this month of destroying millions of manufacturing jobs with \u201cdangerous and foolish\u201d trade deals.ADIt\u2019s easy to see how Biden, who promises to court U.S. allies and to emphasize climate change, would differ from Trump. But the Democratic candidate has sketched an approach to trade that also would depart from the corporation-friendly orthodoxy of the Clinton and Obama years.He told the United Steelworkers union he would insist on \u201cstrong rules of origin\u201d in any new trade deal, which would require more manufacturing in the U.S. while complicating corporate planning. He vowed to crack down on provisions of the tax code that encourage outsourcing, especially in the pharmaceutical industry. And he ruled out the establishment of special tribunals for corporations to dispute actions by U.S. trading partners, which critics have called a private justice system.ADBiden also says he will not complete any new trade deals before first making \u201cmajor investments\u201d in education, infrastructure and manufacturing. And he proposes spending $400 billion on a \u201cBuy America\u201d initiative designed to boost domestic production and build greater resilience into critical supply chains.ADIf pursued in office, the new stance could mark a turn after more than a quarter-century of pro-business tilt for the Democratic Party, some analysts said.\u201cI think we\u2019re in a new world in trade policy,\u201d said Beth Baltzan, a former trade lawyer on the House Ways and Means Committee\u2019s Democratic staff. \u201cPeople understand that a somewhat blind faith in free trade is producing undesirable results.\u201d Biden releases U.S.-centered economic plan, challenging Trump\u2019s \u2018America First\u2019 agendaThe dangers of an increasingly authoritarian China coupled with the coronavirus pandemic\u2019s disruptive effects is prompting a rethinking even among die-hard globalization supporters. The results can be seen in Biden\u2019s recent call for \u201cfundamental reforms that shift production of a range of critical products back to U.S. soil\u201d \u2014 a statement that Peter Navarro, the administration\u2019s most fervent proponent of economic nationalism, could endorse.ADADSupporters of protectionism say Biden could reorient the party\u2019s trade stance away from its reflexive tilt toward corporate priorities. Though harshly critical of Trump\u2019s approach to China, the likely Democratic candidate has promised no quick rollback of the tariffs on Chinese products that U.S. corporations have panned.\u201cThere\u2019s been an evolution among national Democrats on trade policy, and the centerline is not where it used to be,\u201d said Scott Paul, head of the Alliance for American Manufacturing, a union-industry group.To be sure, corporations are attempting to have influence over a potential Biden administration. Securities and investment firms alone have contributed more than $36 million to his campaign and outside groups supporting his candidacy, according to Open Secrets, a nonpartisan group. And many business leaders take solace from the fact that even if the former vice president can\u2019t revive the pro-globalization consensus, he will not continue Trump\u2019s capricious trade-policy-by-tweet.ADAD\u201cThey realize things probably won\u2019t go back to the old world,\u201d said Rufus Yerxa, president of the National Foreign Trade Council, an industry group. \u201cBut it will be a lot more stable than the present world.\u201d Still, as the Washington adage goes, personnel is policy. And many of Biden\u2019s key advisers are veterans of previous Democratic administrations that reduced trade barriers, promising that any jobs lost to low-wage countries would be more than offset by gains from additional exports.While Biden has pledged to name representatives from unions and environmental groups to trade enforcement positions, those who hope he will break decisively with his Democratic predecessors are not yet declaring victory.AD\u201cThe decisions,\u201d said Paul, \u201care made once you\u2019re in office.\u201d The struggle for influence between labor and capital has significant political ramifications.ADIn 2016, Trump barnstormed the industrial Midwest, arguing that the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement and the decision to allow China to join the global trading system in 2001 had eliminated millions of American jobs. That position helped him capture Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin on his way to the presidency.Trump also did better at the polls with union members than any Republican since Ronald Reagan, cutting in half the Democrat\u2019s 2012 margin among labor households. In office, the president has followed through on his campaign promises by raising tariffs on goods from China as well as on steel and aluminum.ADBiden has said he will \u201creview\u201d those levies on industrial metals and will use other tariffs \u201cto win, not just to fake toughness,\u201d according to his answers to a United Steelworkers candidate questionnaire.ADBoth parties supported the integration of low-wage developing countries into the global economy for decades before Trump took office. In the 1990s, President Bill Clinton drew the Democratic Party closer to Wall Street and corporate America in a bid to shed an anti-business image that previously hurt the party.Labor unions have generally opposed trade deals like NAFTA, fearing they opened the door to the exodus of good-paying factory jobs. NAFTA\u2019s labor provisions were tucked into a side letter rather than the treaty itself and did little to prevent that erosion, according to union critics.ADSome advocates of a trade policy that would place greater emphasis on labor and environmental concerns are not yet convinced that a Biden administration would mark a genuine break with the party\u2019s recent history.AD\u201cOur members, they\u2019re cautious on Biden. They look back on his record with TPP, in particular,\u201d said one veteran union official, who asked not to be identified to preserve relationships with the Biden campaign. \u201cThese things are very fresh in the minds of people.\u201d But during the George W. Bush administration, Biden voted against smaller trade deals with Chile, Singapore, Peru and several Central American nations. And some of the veteran Democratic operatives in Biden\u2019s camp have rethought the party\u2019s conventional wisdom.ADJake Sullivan, who served as Biden\u2019s national security adviser, has called for \u201ca different course\u201d on trade, explicitly challenging Obama\u2019s TPP and the conventional wisdom that more trade is always better for the U.S. economy.\u201cForeign policy experts must dispense with the notion that what\u2019s good for U.S.-based multinational corporations is necessarily good for the United States,\u201d wrote Sullivan, and co-author Jennifer Harris, who worked on economic issues for then-secretary of state Hillary Clinton, in a February article in Foreign Policy.ADThe Biden campaign did not respond to a request for comment.Some of the criticisms from the Democrats\u2019 left wing echo those of the Trump administration. Robert E. Lighthizer, the president\u2019s chief trade negotiator, has criticized the TPP for provisions that would have allowed China to establish factories in participating countries and export from there to the U.S. on a duty-free basis. And Trump has employed tariffs freely as a weapon to compel foreign nations to purchase additional American goods.\u201cHe gets credit for being willing to go where other people weren\u2019t willing to go,\u201d said Baltzan, a fellow with Open Markets. \u201cBut we need to remember these arguments started with Democrats.\u201d Biden has said he will renegotiate the 2016 TPP, which was intended to be a counterweight to Chinese influence in Asia. The original agreement included the investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS) system that the former vice president now rejects. Lighthizer, and some Democrats, have criticized the arrangement as an inducement for corporations to ship jobs to low-wage countries, even if their legal system is unreliable.The ISDS panels have long been a standard feature of trade agreements, but the system was largely eliminated in the new U.S.-Mexico-Canada agreement. Only a handful of industries, including energy and telecommunications, retained the ability to pursue claims against the Mexican government before an independent arbitrator rather than in the domestic courts.Some labor officials say the NAFTA replacement that Lighthizer negotiated should be a model for Biden to follow. The new U.S.-Mexico-Canada agreement contains rules of origin designed to steer more manufacturing to high-wage American plants. And it allows U.S. officials to block at the border goods that originate in Mexican factories that violate the deal\u2019s labor provisions.\u201cThe people surrounding Biden have learned a lot post-TPP,\u201d said Cathy Feingold, director of the AFL-CIO\u2019s international department. \u201cThere\u2019s a recognition that trade policy was tilted too much in favor of corporations.\u201d ", "comment": "137 Comments", "topic": "Economy"}, {"cover": "", "title": "5 French fighter jets delivered to India in military upgrade", "date": "Jul 29, 2020", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/5-french-fighter-jets-delivered-to-india-in-military-upgrade/2020/07/29/3c243d04-d18c-11ea-826b-cc394d824e35_story.html", "keyword": "China and Security", "website": "the Washington Post", "author": "", "content": "SRINAGAR, India \u2014 The first batch of five French-made Rafale fighter jets arrived at an Indian air force base on Wednesday, Indian officials said, as the country seeks to modernize its military amid security challenges with Pakistan and China.Support our journalism.

Subscribe today.arrow-rightThe stock market took a dive after the Commerce Department reported the economy shrank by 9.5 percent in the second quarter, the biggest recorded decline since the government began keeping track 70 years ago. The government also reported jobless claims climbing again last week by 1.4\u00a0million, another sign the recovery is fizzling. GDP shrank at an annual rate of 32.9 percent, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis.The dismal statistics  underscored the fragility of any  economic recovery, as many states are reversing their attempts to reopen for business and have imposed new restrictions.ADADAt an evening news briefing, President Trump  tried to swat away the raft of bad news about the economy and the disease, which he referred to as the \u201cChina virus\u201d and compared to a plague.\u201cIt\u2019s China\u2019s fault,\u201d he said flatly.Trump noted a resurgence of the disease in  states that appeared to have vanquished covid-19 early, largely due to draconian restrictions, and suggested the praise was premature.\u201cGovernors that were extremely popular are not so popular anymore,\u201d he said. \u201cThey were held up as models to follow, and then they got it.\u201dBut in deflecting any blame for the spread of the virus he once predicted would miraculously vanish in days and now has killed nearly  150,000 Americans, Trump offered several misrepresentations.ADFor example, he said children were \u201cimmune\u201d to the disease and should return to school this fall. In fact, immunologists have said that while children under the age of 10 are unlikely to transmit the novel coronavirus, children older than 10 can spread it as easily as adults.ADTrump also predicted a rapid economic recovery from the precipitous drop in employment and consumer spending caused by the pandemic.\u201cI think next year\u2019s going to be an excellent year, maybe one of our best years ever from an economic standpoint,\u201d Trump said.Jerome H. Powell, the chair of the Federal Reserve,  said any recovery depends on whether Americans are willing to embrace behavior that can beat back the virus.AD\u201cThe path of the economy is going to depend, to a very high extent, on the course of the virus and on the measures we take to keep it in check,\u201d he said Wednesday. \u201cSocial distancing measures and a fast reopening of the economy actually go together. They\u2019re not in competition with each other.\u201dTrump also used the coronavirus briefing to attack mail-in voting, hours after his Republican allies joined Democrats to rebuff his suggestion to delay the Nov. 3 election.  Trump said he wants the election decided quickly, rather than drag on until millions of mail-in ballots are counted and determined to be legitimate.AD\u201cI don\u2019t want to see that take place in a week, after Nov. 3, or a month,\u201d he said. \u201cOr frankly,  with litigation and everything else that could happen, it could take years. Years. Or you never even know who won the election.\u201dADTrump sounded more muted than combative, as the death toll continued to mount and experts warned of the potential of economic collapse.Nationwide, 1,400 people infected with the coronavirus died Wednesday, the highest number since May. Several states, including Florida and California, reported record highs for deaths in a single day. More than 4.4 million cases have been reported in the United States, and nearly 150,000 people have died, according to The Washington Post tracker.Among the deaths Thursday was well-known businessman turned politician Herman Cain, who sought the Republican nomination for president in 2012. He had attended a June 20 rally for President Trump in Tulsa, where he was photographed maskless in a crowd of others who were also without masks, but it was not determined whether that is where he contracted the virus.ADADAmid mostly glum news, optimism was in short supply. Even though new infections have leveled off in some of the hardest hit states in the South, they are creeping up elsewhere, threatening to  surge.The trends prompted both administration insiders and public health experts to urge governments to act more aggressively.Deborah Birx, the coordinator of the White House coronavirus task force, said states and localities should mandate wearing masks in public.During an appearance on Fox News, Birx said there remains a \u201cvery serious pandemic\u201d in Southern states. Despite signs of improvement, she added, the situation is deteriorating elsewhere.\u201cSo now we see the virus, probably because of vacations and other reasons of travel, moving up into Kentucky, Tennessee, southern Ohio, Missouri, Iowa, Kansas, Nebraska,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd, of course, we continue to have problems across the coast \u2014 Washington, Oregon, California, Idaho and Utah, and now increases in Colorado.\u201dADADBirx called for mandatory measures that Trump and many Americans have resisted, considering them alarmist and an infringement on their liberties.\u201cWe believe if the governors and mayors of every locality right now would mandate masks for their communities and [if] every American would wear a mask and socially distance and not congregate in large settings where you can\u2019t socially distance or wear a mask, that we can really get control of this virus and drive down cases as Arizona has done,\u201d Birx said.The Association of American Medical Colleges issued an ominous warning, along with a  \u201croad map\u201d of actions the country must take to avoid calamity.  AD\u201cIf the nation does not change its course \u2014 and soon \u2014 deaths in the United States could be well into the multiple hundreds of thousands,\u201d the organization said.ADThe Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security released a report Wednesday with 10 recommendations for action and another stark warning.\u201cUnlike many countries in the world, the United States is not currently on course to get control of this epidemic. It\u2019s time to reset,\u201d six scholars wrote.Despite the concerns over the rising death toll and economic impact, at least 17 of 21 states flagged as coronavirus \u201cred zones\u201d are not following all recommendations by the government\u2019s coronavirus task force.ADRep. James E. Clyburn (D-S.C.), the chairman of the House\u2019s Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis, which was formed to assess the Trump administration\u2019s response to the pandemic, wrote governors of several red-zone states urging them to heed experts\u2019 advice.The recent task force report \u201crecommends far stronger public health measures than the Trump Administration has called for in public \u2014 including requiring face masks, closing bars, and strictly limiting gatherings,\u201d Clyburn wrote in a letter to Birx and Vice President Pence. \u201cYet many states do not appear to be following these unpublished recommendations and are instead pursuing policies more consistent with the administration\u2019s contradictory public statements downplaying the seriousness of the threat.\u201dADOhio Gov. Mike DeWine (R) on Thursday asked the state\u2019s liquor control commission to cut off alcohol sales at 10 p.m. each night. Any alcohol purchased by that hour would have to be consumed by 11.Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers (D) said his residents  now must wear masks inside public buildings and businesses. The order \u201cstrongly recommends\u201d face coverings in other settings.Some Republican lawmakers in the state opposed the order, and court challenges to its constitutionality are expected. Elsewhere, some of the restrictions being imposed by local and state authorities are openly flouted.Alabama Republican Senate candidate Tommy Tuberville is fundraising and holding \u00adin-person meetings in Washington this week, defying orders from D.C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) that visitors from Alabama and other coronavirus hot spots quarantine for 14 days upon arrival.ADTuberville spent at least some of his time at the Trump International Hotel, according to a photo posted to Facebook by Rep. Bruce Westerman (R-Ark.) showing the two men in the hotel lobby on Tuesday night. Neither man was masked.Alabama\u2019s coronavirus cases are surging, with more than 25\u00a0percent of its total cases appearing in the past two weeks, according to state data.Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-Tex.) defiantly walked the halls of Congress maskless and wasn\u2019t practicing social distancing before he was told Wednesday he could not fly with Trump on Air Force One to Texas because he had tested positive for the virus.Even then, he returned to the Capitol, ignoring expert advice on how to avoid spreading covid-19 germs, and filmed a video questioning the effectiveness of masks. He even suggested he may have caught the disease from a mask.Gohmert\u2019s mask skepticism spurred House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) to order all lawmakers to wear a mask while appearing on the chamber floor.And earlier this week, the White House confirmed national security adviser Robert C. O\u2019Brien had tested positive for the coronavirus and was working from home after experiencing mild symptoms of the disease. In mid-July, O\u2019Brien was in Paris, where he was photographed with his counterparts in meetings in which they sat around a table close to one another without wearing masks. It was not clear when he was first infected, though.\n\n", "comment": "0 Comments", "topic": "Coronavirus"}, {"cover": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/33Q7M2X34II6THQCDVC4WPP2R4.jpghttps://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/33Q7M2X34II6THQCDVC4WPP2R4.jpg", "title": "The Cybersecurity 202: Chinese hackers could work for the government \u2014 or themselves", "date": "Jul 22, 2020", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/07/22/cybersecurity-202-chinese-hackers-could-work-government-or-themselves/", "keyword": "China and Security", "website": "the Washington Post", "author": "Joseph Marks", "content": "with Tonya RileyA U.S. indictment of Chinese hackers who tried to steal coronavirus vaccine research demonstrates the increasingly fuzzy line between state-sponsored hacking and mere criminality.Support our journalism. Subscribe today.arrow-rightThe hackers Li Xiaoyu and Dong Jiazhi stole data mostly for their own profit but also helped secure information for China\u2019s civilian spy agency, the Ministry of State Security (MSS), according to an indictment\u00a0 by the U.S. Justice Department. They also got help from an insider at the MSS, Ellen Nakashima and Devlin Barrett report.This marks the first time federal prosecutors have charged anyone in China with hacking for both the state and for personal enrichment.ADBut the move reflects a long-term trend in China, Russia, Iran and other U.S. adversary nations where criminal hackers frequently aid state intelligence services when asked, and government and military employees often moonlight by hacking for profit.\u00a0AD\u201cChina has now taken its place, alongside Russia, Iran and North Korea, in that shameful club of nations that provide a safe haven for cybercriminals in exchange for those criminals being \u2018on call\u2019 to work for the benefit of the state, here to feed the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s insatiable hunger for American and other non-Chinese companies\u2019 hard-earned intellectual property, including covid-19 research,\u201d said John C. Demers, head of the Justice Department\u2019s National Security Division.\u00a0Demers accused Chinese officials of being \u201cwilling to turn a blind eye to prolific criminal hackers operating within its borders.\" The indictments came the same day U.S. officials ordered China to close a consulate in Houston and amid a roiling conflict between the nations over intellectual property theft, the coronavirus and China's recent crackdown in Hong Kong.Enlisting criminals to do government hacking work has long been common in Russia.\u00a0That has resulted in a cadre of Russian cybercriminals who operate with relative impunity and often have strong links to the government. One prominent example was Roman Seleznev, the son of a high-ranking Russian parliamentarian who stole millions from Americans in credit card hacking schemes.\u00a0ADADSeleznev was sentenced to 27 years in U.S. prison in 2017 after he was arrested during a vacation in the Maldives and extradited to the United States.\u00a0It\u2019s long been common in China for military hackers to hack for profit during their off hours. But inviting criminals to help do state business is somewhat more novel.\u00a0\u201cThis is a system that\u2019s been used by Russia for years and it\u2019s being emulated by other adversaries,\u201d Tom Kellermann, head of cybersecurity strategy at the software company VMWare, told me.\u00a0He compared it to narcotics traffickers acting with impunity in Latin America.\u00a0\u201cThis is a protection racket we\u2019ve seen before,\u201d Kellermann said. \u201cRussia pioneered this [scenario] where cybercriminals understand that if they act like cyber militias, they\u2019ll be untouched and untouchable by Western law enforcement.\u201dADADWhile the systems function similarly in Russia and China, China probably retains greater control over the sort of cybercrime that happens inside its territory.\u201cRussia\u2019s essentially a haven where you can be a [cyber]criminal and if you work out a deal with the [state intelligence services] and do them favors, they leave you alone,\u201d Jim Lewis, a cybersecurity expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told me. \u201cIn China it\u2019s more complicated. They treat you more like a contractor.\u201dThe Chinese government also has an extensive system to monitor and censor Internet traffic \u2014 often called the \u201cgreat firewall of China\u201d \u2014 which gives officials much greater insight into what criminal hackers are doing and how they can best be pressed into service.Dong and Li\u2019s hacking targets displayed a mix of Chinese state targets and their own financial interests.\u00a0In addition to coronavirus research, the pair targeted high-tech manufacturing, pharmaceuticals and gaming software development companies. They also targeted human rights activists, Hong Kong protesters and the office of the Dalai Lama.ADADThe pair stole terabytes of trade secrets and other data from Western companies over more than a decade. The victim list includes companies in California, Maryland, Washington state, Texas, Virginia and Massachusetts, according to the indictment, which didn\u2019t share the companies\u2019 names.\u00a0More recently they \u201cresearched vulnerabilities in the networks of biotech and other firms publicly known for work on covid-19 vaccines, treatments, and testing technology.\u201d The Justice Department did not say whether they successfully stole any vaccine data.\u00a0The pair was also willing to resort to criminal shakedown techniques. In at least one case they threatened to release source code they\u2019d stolen unless the victim they filched it from paid them off with cryptocurrency, the indictment states.\u00a0ADADThey\u2019re facing 11 counts of conspiring to access computers without authorization, conspiring to steal trade secrets and aggravated identity theft, among other charges.\u00a0\u201cChina steals intellectual property and research which bolsters its economy, and then they use that illicit gain as a weapon to silence any country that would dare challenge their illegal actions,\u201d FBI Deputy Director David Bowdich said. \u201cThis type of economic coercion is not what we expect from a trusted world leader. It is what we expect from an organized criminal syndicate.\u201d\u00a0The porous border between government and criminal hackers also makes it far tougher to combat global cybercrime.\u00a0It's effectively guaranteed, for example, that China will never extradite Dong and Li, to the United States to face charges.\u00a0ADAD\u201cWhat would you call a game where one side plays by the rule and the other side says it won\u2019t? That\u2019s the game we\u2019re in,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cThe Chinese and Russians won\u2019t respect international law unless it\u2019s enforced.\u201dIt\u2019s also more difficult for countries to reliably agree about anything that\u2019s off limits for hacking because governments can claim not \u00a0to be responsible for what cybercriminals in their territory are doing.\u201cIt definitely makes it difficult to be optimistic that you\u2019re going to get to a set of cyber norms,\u201d Adam Segal, a cybersecurity and China expert at the Council on Foreign Relations, told me. \u201cEven if state representatives agree to them, they can just say, \u2018These are criminal hackers and we just can\u2019t rein them in.\u2019 \u201dThe keysWith four months to go, state and county election officials are still behind on basic cybersecurity.\u00a0Some local election officials are still sharing passwords among multiple people, storing lists of passwords in unencrypted formats where hackers can scoop them up and using default passwords that came with their computer programs, Matt Masterson, a top election security official at the Department of Homeland Security, said during a meeting of the National Association of Secretaries of State.ADADIt\u2019s also taking state and local election offices 30 to 60 days to patch known computer bugs, Masterson said. That lag time is a vast improvement from just two years ago but it still gives hackers far too many opportunities to use those bugs to break into election systems and steal or corrupt data, he said. In many cases, local election officials want to patch those bugs more quickly but don\u2019t have the necessary technology and cybersecurity staff to do it, he said.Election officials aren\u2019t doing much worse on cybersecurity than some other major industry sectors but the consequences could be particularly grave. \u201cThe difference is everyone's watching,\u201d Masterson said.\u00a0On the positive side, most of the big problems can be fixed before November if local election offices buckle down. \"There's still lots that can be done in the next several weeks\" before the election, Masterson said.\u00a0Facebook is taking flak for putting the same label on posts about voting by both President Trump and Joe Biden.\u00a0The president's Facebook post was an attack on mail voting, which the president claims without evidence, enables widespread cheating. \u201cMail-In Voting, unless changed by the courts, will lead to the most CORRUPT ELECTION in our Nation\u2019s History! #RIGGEDELECTION,\u201d Trump posted.\u00a0ADADBiden's post read, \u201cWe have to vote Donald Trump out this November,\u201d and solicited donations.The label links to the federal government's website about absentee voting. It's different from the one Facebook uses to flag content that's \u201cnewsworthy\u201d but may violate its policies, Rachel Lerman reports.\u00a0Biden spokesman Bill Russo slammed the company for implying the posts were equivalent.Facebook has pledged to remove posts that suppress voting in the days ahead of the election. But it's resisted calls to fact check the president's false and misleading claims, even as Twitter has proved more willing to do so.\u00a0Roger McNamee, author of \u201cZucked: Waking Up to the Facebook Catastrophe\":Twitter, which added fact-check labels to previous Trump tweets accusing mail-in ballots of being fraudulent, did not label a similar post, citing its policy not to take actions against \u201cbroad, nonspecific statements.\"\u00a0South Korea's coronavirus tracing app could have exposed the location of quarantined users.The app exposed the names and locations of people in quarantine. It also could have allowed hackers to tamper with data to mislead the app about a quarantined individual's location, the New York Times reports.Researcher\u00a0Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Rechtenstein also found that the app made it easy for hackers to steal user data. It kept receiving data from users after their quarantine ended, despite claims to the contrary.\u00a0South Korean officials fixed the app after the New York Times and Rechtenstein contacted them about the vulnerabilities. There's no evidence hackers actually penetrated the app, officials told The Times.The incident highlights the ongoing risks as governments rush to deploy technology to combat the pandemic. South Korean officials justified rushing out the app by saying it was necessary to protect citizens' health.\"We could not afford a time-consuming security check on the app that would delay its deployment,\" said Jung Chan-hyun, an official at the Ministry of the Interior and Safety\u2019s disaster response division.\u00a0Hill happeningsSenate Republicans gave Biden's warning about Russian election interference an icy reception.\u00a0They say his recent remarks are hyping up old news, Martin Matishak at Politico reports.\u00a0\"I think to sound an alarm is to be ignorant of everything that we\u2019ve done since 2016,\" said Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.), who chaired the Senate Intelligence Committee until recently.\u00a0Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), the acting chairman of that committee, agreed.\u201cIt\u2019s not new. It\u2019s something we\u2019re going to face for a long time, unfortunately,\u201d said Rubio. He said he did not know what incidents Biden was citing.The House passed a major defense bill with big cybersecurity reforms.Those include creating a new cyber czar at the White House and banning the Chinese app TikTok from government phones. The bill also grants subsidies to help U.S. companies compete with China for semiconductor productions. It's not clear if those provisions will make it into the Senate version of the bill, which is being debated now.The White House threatened to veto the bill over provisions that would rename some military bases named for Confederate leaders.

I wish I hadn\u2019t.\u201dFast forward three-and-a-half years. During an interview on Tuesday, Trump said he has never raised U.S. intelligence that Russian bounties have been offered to Taliban-linked militants to kill American troops in Afghanistan during any of his conversations with Vladimir Putin, including a call with the Russian president last week. Trump demurred when Axios\u2019s Jonathan Swan asked whether he believes the U.S. intelligence assessment that Russia was behind the deadly program. Instead, just as Brennan says he did at Trump Tower, the president pivoted to China.ADAD\u201cYou know, it\u2019s interesting,\u201d Trump said. \u201cNobody ever brings up China. They always bring up Russia, Russia, Russia. If we can do something with Russia in terms of nuclear proliferation, which is a very big problem, a much bigger problem than global warming in terms of the real world, that would be a great thing.\u201dThese Russian bounties are believed to have resulted in the deaths of several U.S. service members, according to intelligence gleaned from U.S. military interrogations of captured militants in recent months. \u201cIt never reached my desk,\u201d Trump claimed in the interview, a portion of which was posted this morning and will air in full on HBO next week. The Washington Post and other outlets reported last month on the apparent bounty program, but Trump\u2019s aides argued that the intelligence was inconclusive.Trump went on to engage in the whataboutism that has been a hallmark of his tenure. When his interviewer noted that the former commanding general of U.S. forces in Afghanistan has said publicly that Russia is supplying weapons to the Taliban, Trump replied that the United States supplied weapons to the Taliban when they were challenging the Russian occupation in the 1980s. \u201cWe did that too,\u201d he said. In a statement at odds with both history and the facts on the ground, Trump added: \u201cRussia doesn\u2019t want anything to do with Afghanistan.\u201dThe president\u2019s continuing unwillingness to challenge the Kremlin comes as anonymous U.S. government officials are sounding the alarm that Russian intelligence services are using a trio of English-language websites to spread disinformation about the novel coronavirus pandemic. The Associated Press reports that \u201ctwo Russians who have held senior roles in Moscow\u2019s military intelligence service known as the GRU have been identified as responsible for a disinformation effort meant to reach American and Western audiences,\u201d citing U.S. officials who are not authorized to speak publicly.ADAD\u201cBetween late May and early July, one of the [U.S.] officials said, the websites singled out Tuesday published about 150 articles about the pandemic response, including coverage aimed either at propping up Russia or denigrating the U.S.,\u201d per the AP. \u201cOfficials described the Russian disinformation as part of an ongoing and persistent effort to advance false narratives and cause confusion. They did not say whether the effort behind these particular websites was directly related to the November election, though some of the coverage appeared to denigrate Trump\u2019s Democratic challenger, Joe Biden, and called to mind Russian efforts in 2016 \u2026\u00a0\u201cThough U.S. officials have warned before about the spread of disinformation tied to the pandemic, they went further on Tuesday by singling out a particular information agency that is registered in Russia, InfoRos, and that operates a series of websites \u2014 InfoRos.ru, Infobrics.org and OneWorld.press \u2014 that have leveraged the pandemic to promote anti-Western objectives and to spread disinformation. Officials say the sites promote their narratives in a sophisticated but insidious effort that they liken to money laundering, where stories in well-written English \u2014 and often with pro-Russian sentiment \u2014 are cycled through other news sources to conceal their origin and enhance the legitimacy of the information. \u2026 A headline Tuesday on InfoRos.ru about the unrest roiling American cities read \u2018Chaos in the Blue Cities\u2019 \u2026 Another story carried the headline of \u2018Ukrainian Trap for Biden,\u2019 and claimed that \u2018Ukrainegate\u2019 \u2014 a reference to stories surrounding Biden\u2019s son Hunter\u2019s former ties to a Ukraine gas company \u2014 \u2018keeps unfolding with renewed vigor.\u2019\u201dBrennan\u2019s new memoir, \u201cUndaunted: My Fight Against America\u2019s Enemies, at Home and Abroad,\u201d is scheduled to be published on Oct. 6.\u00a0My colleague Shane Harris, who has reviewed portions of the book, reports this morning that when Brennan asked the CIA, where he had worked for nearly 30 years, to review his official records, the agency said no. Brennan learned that this break with decades of tradition resulted from a directive issued by Trump in August 2018 to prohibit anyone in the intelligence community from sharing classified information with him. A White House spokesman confirms that Trump issued the order, tailored at one of his most outspoken critics.ADAD\u201cIn January of this year, Brennan says, he wrote to the current CIA director, Gina Haspel, after learning about the president\u2019s order,\u201d Shane reports. \u201cBrennan says Haspel never responded to his letter or contacted him to discuss the situation, a silence he found \u2018very disappointing\u2019 given their years working together at the CIA. \u2018So much for my fervent hope that interactions with my successors would be unencumbered by Washington\u2019s partisan waters,\u2019 Brennan writes, in a dig at Haspel, who current and former officials say has made it her practice to stay on Trump\u2019s good side.\u201dIn the section of his book recounting the Jan. 6, 2017, briefing at Trump Tower, Brennan writes that Trump seemed more interested in challenging the intelligence assessment than in understanding the threat posed by Russia. \u201cTrump\u2019s alertness never faded during the briefing, but his demeanor as well as his questions strongly revealed that he was uninterested in finding out what the Russians had done or in holding them to account,\u201d Brennan writes. \u201cIt was also my clear impression that he was seeking most to learn what we knew and how we knew it. That deeply troubled me, as I worried about what he might do with the information he was being given.\u201dAttorney General Bill Barr said Tuesday that Americans \u201chave to assume\u201d Russia is trying to interfere in the looming election, though he offered no specifics. During an acrimonious House Judiciary Committee hearing, Rep. David Cicilline (D-R.I.) asked Barr whether it would be appropriate for the president \u201cto solicit or accept foreign assistance in an election.\u201d Barr answered that \u201cit depends what kind of assistance.\u201d Cicilline said he was referring \u201cany kind\u201d of assistance, to which Barr answered more definitively: \u201cNo, it\u2019s not appropriate.\u201d Rep. Cedric Richmond (D-La.) asked Barr if he believes the election will be \u201crigged.\u201d Trump has repeatedly suggested as much. \u201cI have no reason to think it will be,\u201d Barr said.ADADThe attorney general also defended his interventions in the criminal cases of Trump\u2019s friends and allies, including the president\u2019s longtime political adviser Roger Stone and former national security adviser Michael Flynn. Barr claimed he was unaware at the time that the Justice Department\u2019s Bureau of Prisons had decided Trump\u2019s ex-attorney Michael Cohen should go back to prison for refusing to agree not to talk to the media or write a book, which will accuse Trump of making racist and anti-Semitic comments.\u00a0Stone was convicted of tampering with a witness and lying to Congress about his efforts to learn of Democratic emails that had been hacked by the Russians during the 2016 campaign. Trump commuted Stone\u2019s sentence this month shortly before he was due to report to prison. Flynn twice pleaded guilty to lying to FBI agents to conceal conversations he had with the then-Russian ambassador during the transition. Barr has moved to dismiss the case against Flynn altogether. Cohen, who flipped on the president, pleaded guilty to lying to Congress about a Moscow real estate project that Trump and his company pursued as he ran for president in 2016. In his plea deal, he said he knowingly lied under oath to hew closely to Trump\u2019s public denials of his business interests in Russia.\u00a0\u201cThe president\u2019s friends don\u2019t deserve special breaks,\" Barr said during the hearing, \u201cbut they also don\u2019t deserve to be treated more harshly than other people.\u201dThe coronavirus contagionCoronavirus cases are on the rise in the Midwest as they ebb in the Sun Belt.\u201cAnthony S. Fauci, the nation\u2019s leading infectious-disease expert, warned that positive coronavirus tests were rising in Ohio, Indiana, Tennessee and Kentucky as the number of new cases is showing signs of leveling off in Florida, Texas, Arizona and California,\u201d Carol Morello reports:ADAD\u201cA few hours later, Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine (R) said Fauci\u2019s appraisal was correct as he announced limits on county fairs, barring grandstand events, rides and games. He noted that emergency visits are decreasing and new cases have plateaued, but hospitalizations are on the upswing. Stressing the highly infectious nature of the virus, DeWine told reporters at his televised briefing about a 40-minute car ride that four people recently took to an Ohio lake. One person had the virus but didn\u2019t know it. Within days, 10 people were sick, with two hospitalized and in intensive care, and three businesses had to be temporarily shuttered. \u2026 Ohio State University told season ticket holders that any football games at Ohio Stadium this year will be at 20 percent capacity, with no tailgating allowed. \u2026 DeWine, who put a mask mandate into effect two weeks ago, said two good friends contracted the disease, one of whom died.

Andy Beshear (D) on Monday announced that bars would be shut down for two weeks and that restaurants\u2019 indoor dining would be restricted to 25 percent capacity. He also recommended schools postpone in-person instruction until late August. In Virginia, Gov. Ralph Northam (D) announced new restrictions on restaurants and gatherings in the Hampton Roads area as new coronavirus cases rise. \u2026 Nationwide, the number of cases appears to have leveled off to a seven-day moving average of around 66,000 new cases daily. The slight decline registered Tuesday followed five weeks of steadily rising numbers. At least 4,315,000 coronavirus cases have been reported in the United States, with more than 54,000 added to the tally on Monday. More than 1,000 new fatalities were recorded Monday, raising the U.S. death toll to more than 145,000.\u201dEvidence is growing that young people who work outside the home, or who surged into bars and restaurants when states relaxed shutdowns, are infecting their more vulnerable elders, especially family members.

It was unclear, and may remain so, whether the Nationals were willing to go so far as to boycott the series had MLB insisted it go on. \u2026\u201cWith a total of 11 postponements so far, and with an already-compressed schedule that makes it difficult if not impossible to make them all up, it appears increasingly probable some teams could play fewer than 60 games \u2014 in which case MLB would probably determine division standings and playoff spots by winning percentage.

He ran a tree-trimming service and a business that built office cubicles. He was 37 and had never voted,\u201d Josh Partlow reports from Olympia, Wash. \u201cNow he has formed his own political party and is the leader of American Wolf, a roving band of civilians who have anointed themselves \u2018peacekeepers\u2019 amid months of tense protests over racism and policing. In the name of law and order, members of his informal group have shot paintballs at demonstrators and carry zip ties and bear spray as they look for antifascists. Diaz has done \u2018recon\u2019 in Minneapolis and Seattle\u2019s \u2018autonomous zone,\u2019 and drove his American Wolf mobile home to Mount Rushmore to celebrate Independence Day with President Trump.\u201cAmerica\u2019s summer of anxiety and rage has swept up men like Diaz, energizing conservatives who are deploying to the front lines of the culture war. Across the country, conservative armed civilians have surged into public view \u2014 marching on statehouses, challenging Black Lives Matter protests, chasing Internet rumors \u2014 and bringing the threat of lethal force to local politics. Their emergence has prompted congressional hearings on the surge in anti-government militias and domestic extremism and has alarmed researchers who track hate groups. Unlike the old image of militiamen as fringe elements motivated by a desire to overthrow the federal government, these groups often rally in defense of the president and see themselves as pro-government allies of local law enforcement.\u201dTrump is limiting DACA work permits, as his administration looks into ways to end the program.\u201cThe White House said Tuesday it will limit work permits for undocumented immigrants brought to the United States as children to one year instead of two, as administration officials reconsider whether to terminate an eight-year-old program that protects such immigrants from deportation,\u201d Maria Sacchetti reports. \u201cThe move comes more than a month after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled 5 to 4 that the Trump administration could not carry out its plans to end the Obama-era program known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, because it had not provided proper legal justification for terminating it. \u2026 Acting Department of Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf published a memo on Tuesday limiting the work permits and signaling that DACA \u2018presents serious policy concerns that may warrant its full rescission.\u2019 He said he would continue to bar new applications. \u2026 Approximately 640,000 people remain in the program, and many are health-care workers, teachers and emergency responders.\u201dHow would the armed forces respond if Trump pulled them into a disputed election?\u201cTrump\u2019s refusal to commit to accepting the results of the November election, paired with his penchant for plunging the military into the partisan fray, has prompted scholars and legal experts to ask a once-unthinkable question,\u201d Missy Ryan and Paul Sonne report. \u201cScholars cautioned that they are not suggesting that the military would proactively seek to influence the vote, but rather that Pentagon leaders could be forced in a disputed election to become involved in a way that would appear partisan, similar to what occurred in the nation\u2019s capital in the wake of protests in June. History suggests military involvement is unlikely, experts say. But since the first days of Trump\u2019s presidency, when he used the Pentagon\u2019s Hall of Heroes to sign a ban on travel from majority-Muslim nations, the president has repeatedly defied civil-military norms, treating troop events like campaign rallies and intervening in military justice cases.\u201dViral video shows NYPD officers forcing protester into unmarked van.\u201cWhen an unmarked Kia minivan screeched to a stop near protesters marching in Manhattan on Tuesday evening, the demonstrators\u2019 surprise swiftly gave way to alarm.

They say the cases highlight the difficulties they often face in trying to unravel these incidents, which are often clouded by claims of self-defense or lost or disoriented drivers. \u2026\u00a0\u201cSince the eruption of coast-to-coast protests after the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis on Memorial Day, dozens of motorists have been recorded driving their vehicles into marchers on city streets or highways. The encounters have produced terrifying videos of protesters leaping to safety or being rammed by vehicles, the latest sign of the nation\u2019s political and cultural division. Researcher Ari Weil, of the Chicago Project on Security and Threats (CPOST) at the University of Chicago, has documented 75 cases of drivers moving into protests between May 27 and July 7 \u2014 68 involving civilians and seven involving law enforcement. But prosecutors had filed charges in just 33 of those cases, with drivers accused of recklessness or felony assault and, in one case, facing a state hate-crime charge. \u2026 The incidents highlight just how dangerous some protests have become, including demonstrators now arming themselves to try to self-police their events.\u201dThe electionsJoe Biden said he will make a decision on his running mate by the end of next week.\u201cBiden said he was not sure whether he would be able to meet face-to-face with the women vying to be his running mate, considering coronavirus concerns,\u201d Annie Linskey and Sean Sullivan report. \u201c\u2018We\u2019ll see,\u2019 he said, speaking to reporters in Wilmington, Del., after giving an address on his new economic plan for racial equality.

Subscribe today.arrow-rightJuly 21The Washington Post on the recent hacking of several high-profile Twitter accounts:\u201cTough day for us at Twitter,\u201d company chief executive Jack Dorsey tweeted last Wednesday, after several high-profile accounts on his site were hacked. This was an understatement.The security breach the social media network experienced last week was alarming not only for what happened but also for what could have happened. Accounts from Warren Buffett to Kanye West to Joe Biden promised to double money sent to a Bitcoin address. \u201cI am giving back to my community due to covid-19!\u201d former president Barack Obama, another victim, appeared to declare.ADThe perpetrator made off with about $118,000. But imagine trusted accounts hijacked to share false news of a massive terror attack and unleash financial meltdown \u2014 or imagine them taken over on Election Day to give voters false information about polling places.ADThese worse-case scenarios point to the risks when public and even government figures carry out essential functions on a single private platform. The mishap should teach elected officials not to rely exclusively on Twitter or Facebook or anything else to communicate with constituents. But it should also teach platforms to adopt smarter cybersecurity practices.Twitter hasn\u2019t yet provided a full post-mortem, but a blog post from the company combined with reporting from multiple outlets offers a peek: A hacker lurking on a forum generally used for stealing and then selling credentials to accounts with coveted short-character screen names (often an individual letter or number such as @6 or @y) boasted that he had access to Twitter\u2019s internal controls.ADHe gained these through \u201csocial engineering\u201d \u2014 which could mean phishing of employees or bribery or even an insider-initiated attack. Once he had done so, he could bypass all the safeguards people are always being told are essential to responsible security.ADOf course, these safeguards are still essential. But companies such as Twitter must also take steps to ensure the integrity of their platforms, primarily when it comes to administrative tools employees use to touch the most sensitive information. Sites should require more sources of authentication for getting into those systems; a password alone shouldn\u2019t be enough.They should also scale back the number of workers who can use the systems, and institute robust monitoring programs that alert them when something suspicious is happening behind the scenes. And they ought to consider implementing special protection programs for sensitive accounts of the precise type that were compromised last week.ADThe FBI is investigating what happened, and lawmakers have asked for information. Twitter has promised a fuller explanation to the public of what went wrong. It should deliver that \u2014 along with an explanation of how it means to ensure things don\u2019t go wrong again.ADOnline: https://www.washingtonpost.com/___July 21The Dallas Morning News on the death of U.S. Congressman John Lewis:Right now, America needs heroes. And we have one for the ages in John Lewis.His life of sacrifice in the name of the larger principles of freedom and equality and his career of service to his country are emblems of the better America we hope to be and the better America we can become.ADIn remembering him, we should remember that the struggle for equality is an enduring human struggle, that it will not come cheaply nor easily, that the path can be dangerous and the pain very real, and that it will almost certainly never be over.We can remember too, though, that it can be rewarded \u2014 that things can get better \u2014 and that Lewis\u2019 sacrifice, along with those of the Freedom Riders and so many advocates for reform, bequeathed to us a better nation, where we more fully, if still imperfectly, embrace the individual dignity of each American and extend in law the protection of their basic human rights.ADLewis, who died at 80 Friday, had his skull cracked with a billy club as a young man to help bring us to this place where we are. And even as violence was done upon him, he rejected violence in return. The undeniable moral authority that he carried on the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Ala., in 1965 was the authority that finally mattered.ADIn considering his legacy, we must also consider the work that remains. Poverty, imprisonment and other legacies of slavery and codified racism still track our country. Lewis supported the marches in opposition of police violence against Black Americans and considered them an extension of his work as a young man.We also hope, as we memorialize his life and all he did as a protester, organizer and congressman, that we don\u2019t fail to recognize the truth that his work mattered because it made a real difference in our country and in improving the lives of Black Americans. The America that John Lewis died in is not the same America he was born into as the child of sharecroppers. It is not the same America that disenfranchised Black Americans as a matter of law denied them basic human rights.ADIt is an America that took his search for justice and equality seriously, that cared his body was beaten and his skull fractured, that rejected the forces of inequality, segregation and racism.ADThat better America is an America we must work toward every day. The struggle is renewed over and over in each of us as individuals and in all of us as a society.John Lewis has died. But in a good and ever better America, John Lewis will live forever.Online: https://www.dallasnews.com/___July 21The Wall Street Journal on charges brought against a Missouri couple for displaying guns at protesters during a demonstration outside their mansion:By now all America knows Mark and Patricia McCloskey from the video showing the St. Louis couple holding legal firearms as they defended themselves and their home from a crowd of protesters trespassing on their property. A politically motivated prosecutor on Monday charged the couple with unlawful use of a weapon.ADADThe felony count is because they pointed their weapons at protesters. Mr. McCloskey said he did so because he was \u201cscared for my life,\u201d and that of his wife. No shots were fired. Yet now prosecutor Kim Gardner is charging them on grounds they made the trespassers fear for their safety.The good news is that there\u2019s been plenty of official blowback. Missouri Gov. Mike Parson tweeted that \u201cWe will not allow law-abiding citizens to be targeted for exercising their constitutional rights.\u201d He has promised a pardon if they\u2019re convicted.Attorney General Eric Schmitt is working to get the case dismissed, noting that, in addition to the U.S. and Missouri constitutions, Missouri law recognizes the \u201ccastle doctrine.\u201d This allows residents to use force against intruders, including deadly force, based on self-defense and the notion that your home is your castle.ADADMs. Gardner contends that those who surrounded the McCloskeys were \u201cpeaceful, unarmed protesters,\u201d and the couple were therefore interfering in the crowd\u2019s First Amendment rights. It doesn\u2019t seem to have occurred to Ms. Gardner that the guns they carried may be a reason events didn\u2019t turn violent. \u201cI really thought it was Storming the Bastille, that we would be dead and the house would be burned and there was nothing we could do about it,\u201d Mr. McCloskey told KSDK in an interview.Even if the charges are dismissed, or the McCloskeys are pardoned after being convicted, again we have a public official responsible for upholding law and order wink at a mob while treating law-abiding citizens as criminals. If police cannot be counted on to deal with mobs, it\u2019s even more vital that law-abiding Americans are free to exercise their Second Amendment right to protect themselves.Online: https://www.wsj.com/AD___July 20The Los Angeles Times on President Donald Trump sending federal law enforcement officers to Portland, Oregon:The deployment of federal agents in Portland, Ore., over the objection of state and local officials, to shoot and gas protesters and to snatch people from the street to stuff them into unmarked vans is an unconscionable assault on democracy and a dangerous and needless ratcheting up of tension.President Trump\u2019s action in defiance of Oregon\u2019s governor and Portland\u2019s mayor has predictably given new life to nonstop protests that began after the May 25 death of George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody but at last had begun to peter out. The president has thus employed his wretched talent for exacerbating division and inflaming discord at precisely the time the nation needs a leader to calm overheated passions and fears.Presidents have broad power to deploy troops to quell lawlessness, but they generally exercise that power only when governors request assistance, or when the commander-in-chief himself determines that state authorities are failing to deal with the problem.They send in federal forces to protect people or to enforce the Constitution, as when President Eisenhower sent troops to Little Rock, Ark., in 1957 to enforce the right of Black students to enroll in a previously all-white high school and to make clear that the famous Supreme Court ruling in Brown vs. Board of Education would be enforced, that the doctrine of \u201cseparate but equal\u201d had been overturned, and that state segregationists could not defy the basic American principle that all people are equal under law.Trump, by contrast, directed federal agencies to use their muscle to protect statues, monuments and other federal properties, not people or the Constitution. And he said Monday that he plans to do this in more cities \u2014 evidently, because he thinks displaying force against the citizenry is going to help him in November.This has become part of his pattern. In the weeks before overreacting to the Portland protests, Trump used troops to clear his path for a photo op near the White House. He set forth his doctrine that \u201cwhen the looting starts, the shooting starts.\u201d He articulated his principle that states should \u201cdominate the streets,\u201d and if they didn\u2019t, that he would override their authority.It is a fact that some individuals have used the protests in Portland as an opportunity to destroy property and inject chaos into the demonstrations. It fell to Portland leaders to strike the proper balance. They could respond with force, and thus play into protesters\u2019 hands by presenting police engaged in precisely the kind of actions that were being protested; or they could monitor the situation, give protesters the room to make their case, tolerate some property losses and allow the demonstrations to die down on their own.They made their choices, and they may well have made some bad ones. Portland has been on edge for weeks. But Mayor Ted Wheeler is the person answerable to the city\u2019s people. He did not need, and did not seek, federal backup.Trump\u2019s insistence on federalizing the situation on his own undermines Portlanders\u2019 control of their own city, and exacerbates the violence far more than the protesters\u2019 actions did.The president has in effect equated people protesting police brutality with terrorists, and is treating them as such.In October, before Trump\u2019s impeachment, before the COVID-19 pandemic, before the death of Floyd and before the nationwide protests, the president signed an order creating a Commission on Law Enforcement and the Administration of Justice. As with so many steps Trump takes, this one appeared to be geared directly toward undoing an action of the Obama administration, in this case the creation of the 2015 President\u2019s Task Force on 21st Century Policing.The Obama task force delved into police brutality, racial disparities in arrests and prosecutions, and other challenges facing modern-day policing in the U.S. Its recommendations included enhancing civilian oversight, improving training and building trust and legitimacy. Many of its efforts were rolled back by the Trump administration.In launching Trump\u2019s commission, Atty. Gen. William Barr included as a central question something that apparently baffles him as well as the president: Why is there a \u201ccontinued lack of trust and respect for law enforcement\u201d in many communities?The answer is right under their noses. It is spread out on the street with George Floyd, it is shoved alongside protesters into unmarked federal police vans, it stands agog, with many of us, at actions to protect statues but shoot projectiles at people. The president won\u2019t look. He sees what he sees, with eyes that won\u2019t open.Online: https://www.latimes.com___July 18The South China Morning Post on tensions between the United States and China:The risk of military conflict in the South China Sea between China and the United States is high and tensions are rising. In the midst of the Covid-19 crisis, amid discord on a wide range of issues and shortly after both held naval exercises in the area at the same time, American Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has raised the stakes to even more worrying levels by ending his country\u2019s silence on territorial disputes in the contested waters.His siding with Southeast Asian nations over Beijing was to be expected, as was the foreign ministry\u2019s angry response, but weighing in on so sensitive a row is a further unnecessary provocation that puts the rivals and their allies on a dangerous course. With relations arguably at their worst and seemingly spiraling out of control, there is every need for a diplomatic solution, no matter how remote that may appear.Beijing has wasted no time in assuring Southeast Asian countries, with President Xi Jinping phoning the leaders of Singapore and Thailand and Foreign Minister Wang Yi contacting his Philippine counterpart. Washington\u2019s refraining from commenting on the South China Sea issue had made a peaceful agreement between China and its neighbors on the various sovereignty claims more possible. Increasingly frequent sailings of US warships through the contested waters were voiced in terms of ensuring freedom of navigation in the busy shipping lanes.But Pompeo discarded the US\u2019 position last week, describing Beijing\u2019s claims to parts of the resource-rich seas as \u201ccompletely unlawful\u201d, aligning for the first time with a 2016 tribunal ruling by the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, which has not been acceded to by the US. Neither side is blameless, but US President Donald Trump\u2019s administration has taken an increasingly antagonistic approach towards China on a widening range of issues. It has blamed Beijing for the coronavirus pandemic, an unproven claim that is in the way of cooperation to develop a vaccine.The Sino-US relationship is among the most important in the world and talks improve understanding. A meeting in Hawaii last month between China\u2019s top diplomat, Yang Jiechi, and Pompeo, was an opportunity to explain positions and visualise limits.Wang recently laid out a strategy in which he proposed Chinese and American think tanks draw up three lists detailing areas of cooperation and discord so that disputes could be managed and their impact on relations minimised. Restraint is a sensible course and also a form of diplomacy. Pursuing the alternative makes no sense when the world\u2019s most pressing agenda should be fighting the coronavirus on two challenging fronts, health and livelihoods. Dialogue, not confrontation, is urgently needed to avoid crossing red lines.Online: https://www.scmp.com/___July 18The New York Times on expanding internet access for Americans amid the coronavirus pandemic:When Autumn Lee, a pre-med junior at the University of New Mexico, needs to download lectures or class assignments, she hops in her car and drives 45 minutes to the McDonald\u2019s nearest to her town of Sanders, Ariz., to connect to reliable Wi-Fi from her car. After the university sent students home because of the coronavirus pandemic, Ms. Lee grew frustrated with what she said is expensive and data-restricted internet service in Sanders, an unincorporated village of fewer than 1,000 people in eastern Arizona. Relying on her smartphone data plan wasn\u2019t much of an alternative.\u201cIt took one or two hours to watch a 20-minute lecture,\u201d she said. \u201cI just got so frustrated, I figured there had to be another way.\u201d So she made the 40-mile trek several times each week \u2014 and she\u2019ll likely have to keep doing it now that the school has canceled nearly all in-person classes for the fall.Like Ms. Lee, many other Americans sheltering from Covid-19 are discovering the limitations of the country\u2019s cobbled-together broadband service. Schooling, jobs, government services, medical care and child care that once were performed in person have been turned over to the web, exposing a deep rift between the broadband haves and have-nots.Those rifts are poised to turn into chasms, as the global pandemic threatens another year of in-person schooling for American children. Large public-school districts like Los Angeles and Prince George\u2019s County in Maryland, as well as a variety of colleges and universities, from Hampton to Harvard to Scripps, have canceled in-school instruction at the start of the coming year.Gov. Gavin Newsom on Friday announced rules that would require the vast majority of schools in California to begin the year remotely, meaning millions of pupils will need a reliable internet connection throughout the day for instruction. Additional districts that are going online only at the start of the year include Nashville, Houston and Atlanta.Other districts will surely follow, as the raging contagion in their communities gives them little alternative. An adequate connection is no longer a matter of convenience; it is a necessity for anyone wishing to participate in civil society.Service is often unavailable or too expensive in rural communities and low-income neighborhoods. This has forced people into parking lots outside libraries, schools and coffee shops to find a reliable signal \u2014 while others are simply staying logged off. At the same time, there is pressure on small businesses that are still using pen and paper to modernize or face extinction.Yet, federal and local initiatives have failed to bring swift internet service to tens of millions of Americans. Like electricity, internet service has become a necessity for modern life.\u201cWhat Covid-19 has done is accelerate the pace of technological change,\u201d said Kathryn de Wit, manager of the Pew Charitable Trust\u2019s broadband research initiative. \u201cGetting online isn\u2019t an option anymore, and if you don\u2019t have that connection, you\u2019re pretty much cut off.\u201dEfforts to fix this inequity extend back at least as far as 2009, when Congress directed the Federal Communications Commission to develop a plan to get broadband service to nearly every American.Some 21 million still lack it, according to commissioners\u2019 estimates. Yet that might be an underestimate: One study puts it far higher, at around 42 million. The Pew Research Center said as many as one in four rural Americans lack high-speed internet service, because of either the cost or a lack of availability.Microsoft and others have disputed the F.C.C.\u2019s data, which relies on self-reporting from internet service providers \u2014 reporting that can indicate an entire census block has service even if service is provided to just one household within the area.Getting an accurate count of where broadband is needed is critical, because it helps federal programs like the Rural Digital Opportunity Fund determine where to spend to expand broadband\u2019s reach, meaning the Opportunity Fund\u2019s $20.4 billion in planned outlays over the next 10 years could still leave many Americans behind. Two of the F.C.C.\u2019s five commissioners dissented over parts of the funding, citing the faulty accounting.Two bills passed by the House last year would help improve how broadband\u2019s reach is counted. These bills are encouraging bipartisan steps toward addressing the problem.Also worthy of strong consideration is a bill introduced last month by Representative James Clyburn, Democrat of South Carolina. It was followed by a Senate version this month, that would devote $100 billion toward making broadband accessible in underserved areas. But Republicans have indicated that they are not likely to support it.In urban areas, the struggle to get reliable or affordable internet service disproportionately affects minorities.The cost of broadband makes it three times more likely that households without internet service can be found in urban, rather than rural, environments, according to John B. Horrigan of the Technology Policy Institute. Distance learning over Zoom may be a poor substitute for the real thing, but with school closings amid the coronavirus extending into the fall, students without home internet connections could slip further behind.To help bridge the gap, some school districts distributed Wi-Fi hot spots and laptops to needy students. Francine Hernandez drove to a Tucson, Ariz. parking lot with her 14-year-old daughter every day for nearly a month to access Wi-Fi beamed from yellow district school buses. She said the family had lost service after her husband lost his job, making this the best alternative.\u201cIt was the only way she could finish her homework,\u201d said Ms. Hernandez. She said she sat in the car with her daughter for three hours at a stretch until the buses left before lunch.Today, broadband is a patchwork of infrastructure and services offered primarily by major corporations like Verizon and AT&T. But swaths of the country have been left with no service, either because of a lack of perceived profits or a lack of the political will to extend fiber to harder-to-reach communities.Electrifying the entire country a century ago was made possible by a coordinated federal plan from the administration of Franklin D. Roosevelt The Rural Electrification Administration brought electricity to areas outside city centers through federal loans to small cooperatives formed to bring power lines and generators to their communities.While such a centralized effort may be unlikely today without the urgency of the New Deal, the coronavirus has demonstrated that it is time for the federal government to think more creatively and to act more swiftly to deploy broadband service.As service areas exist today, Geoff Wiggins cannot get broadband internet service extended to his house in Liberty Township, Ohio, near Columbus, even though he lives just a few houses in either direction from available service. He said a local provider told him he\u2019d have to pay more than $30,000 to get internet cable extended just to his driveway. So he has relied on wireless service from phone providers and weekend excursions to the parking lots of nearby businesses.Universal broadband will be costly, but shelter-in-place orders have demonstrated that it is even more costly to leave so many Americans behind. A House bill to accelerate deployment of the $20.4 billion overseen by the Rural Digital Opportunity Fund is a start, but the F.C.C. has estimated it could take $80 billion to reach nearly every American without broadband. House Democrats proposed in April that more than $80 billion be authorized over five years for broadband expansion.\u201cPeople are afraid of the price tag,\u201d said Mr. Clyburn, a co-sponsor of the bill along with Representative Fred Upton, Republican of Michigan. \u201cWe can\u2019t afford not to do it.\u201dPerhaps more daunting is the challenge of providing service that is speedy and at a price that even lower-income Americans can afford. One study found that poorer Americans can afford only $10 a month for internet service. But such service is typically at far slower speeds than what is available in more affluent neighborhoods, or for free at Starbucks.Private industry may have little desire to provide lower-tier broadband service when it can profit far more from higher-end services. The expansion of federal programs, like E-Rate, to allow schools to distribute broadband service directly to students could also help lower costs.But those solutions are not a fix to the broader problem. Drawing Wi-Fi from school buses and fast-food restaurants isn\u2019t a long-term solution.Online: https://www.nytimes.com/Copyright 2020 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

And so is concern that the government may not take the steps needed to support hiring and growth. With unemployment still at a high 11.1% and hiring potentially slowing in July, the economy is likely to weaken further without more government aid, economists say.

The price of gold has climbed nearly 27% this year, more than double the return of the largest U.S. bond funds and towering over the roughly 1% return of big U.S. stocks. The biggest reason for the surge is fear surrounding the pandemic. No one knows how many people the new virus will ultimately kill \u2014 or how much of the world\u2019s economy it will destroy.

The move, announced Monday, comes as stores are rethinking the Black Friday in-store door busters as they try to curb the spread of the coronavirus, which has seen a resurgence in a slew of states. Target opened for the first time on Thanksgiving in 2011, joining other stores in launching Black Friday sales a day early and creating a new tradition of shoppers heading out to the stores after their turkey feast. The bigger question still looms on how to handle Black Friday itself this year, which also draws huge crowds \u2014 and sales.AD___The S&P 500 climbed 23.78 points, or 0.7%to 3,239.41.

Economists across the ideological spectrum agree that inaction would both worsen and prolong the recession.Amid the cascading crises buffeting the country, one of the complications holding up the GOP\u2019s release of their counteroffer to the bill that House Democrats previously passed had nothing to do with the contagion: The White House is pushing to include language related to the location of the FBI's headquarters.This is just the latest example of President Trump appearing not to have his eye on the ball.The FBI building is catty-corner from the Trump International Hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue NW. \u201cTrump has expressed interest in the location of the FBI\u2019s headquarters for some time,\u201d Erica Werner, Seung Min Kim and Jeff Stein report. \u201cThe details were unclear, but the Trump administration previously scrapped a plan to move the FBI headquarters to the suburbs, instead seeking to rebuild a new FBI building in its current location.\u201d\u00a0ADADDuring his daily coronavirus news conference on Thursday evening, Trump defended his push to keep the FBI based where it is now and to give the agency a new state-of-the-art building. Left unsaid was that this could raise property values and help put more potential customers next to his personal business. But he also suggested that he will not demand that it happen in this must-pass legislation.\u00a0\u201cThis one is very old, and \u2026 it was never built to a very high standard,\u201d Trump said of the FBI building. \u201cFrankly, you have to be near the Justice Department. There's nothing better than the site. \u2026 They were looking at sites in Maryland and Virginia, in different places, but they would\u2019ve been too far away. So I am, I've been, encouraging them to build it.\u201d\u201cBecause FBI people like to work out a lot,\u201d Trump said, a new facility at the current site could include quarter-mile running tracks on the roof. \u201cYou can renovate the existing building \u2026 or you could take it down and build a great building for the FBI for 100 years and have it be incredible,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I think \u2026 the best idea would be to build a new building. \u2026 I know they're talking about it, whether or not they put it in this bill or someplace else, but the FBI needs a new building, and we'll get it done.\u201dADADRepublicans had hoped to unveil the text of a plan that they could agree to on Wednesday, but the process has proven contentious within the conference. \u201cSensing the potential economic calamity of pulling back these (unemployment) benefits for up to 30 million people all at once, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin suggested Congress consider a smaller bill to keep these benefits in place while other details are negotiated on Capitol Hill. But Democrats and Republicans roundly dismissed that idea immediately,\u201d per Erica, Seung Min and Jeff.\u00a0The GOP\u2019s new goal is to unveil a proposal on Monday. In a floor speech, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said what they eventually put out would include a new round of stimulus checks, aid for schools, money for testing, changes to unemployment assistance rules, more money for small businesses and legal protections to make it hard for people to sue their employers if they become sick after being called back to work. A new round of funding for the Paycheck Protection Program is also expected.The pandemic has outlasted the PPP.\u201cThe phone stopped ringing at the Nelsons\u2019 auto-body shop in Broomfield, Colo., in March,\u201d Eli Rosenberg reports. \u201cThe normal four-to-six-week wait for customers looking to have dents or bumps fixed on their cars disappeared, leaving the shop silent. Tammy Nelson and her husband, Scott, applied in April for a loan from \u2026 the federal government\u2019s chaotic $660 billion aid program meant to help businesses and their workers stay afloat. But the PPP loan had only delayed the inevitable \u2014 the phone didn\u2019t start ringing again amid the surging pandemic. Nelson laid off her five employees at the end of June, including herself and her husband.\u00a0 \u2026 \u2018It was just a Band-Aid on a bullet wound,\u2019 Nelson said of the PPP. \u2018All it really did was prolong the agony of having our workers file for unemployment. Whether it\u2019s April 15 or June 30, the end result is still the same.\u2019 \u2026ADAD\u201cAlthough there\u2019s no official tally on numbers of layoffs tied to companies whose PPP funding is expiring, the National Federation of Independent Business, a trade association for small businesses, found that 22 percent of PPP recipients surveyed have laid off or expect to lay off employees after using up their PPP loan \u2026 In recent weeks, layoffs have been reported at the Buffalo-based New Era Cap Co., which received $5 million to $10 million; Peoria Charter Coach, a bus travel company that laid of 132 workers \u2014 95 percent of its workforce \u2014 after using up the $1 million to $2 million PPP loan; at least a dozen museums including National September 11 Memorial and Museum and the Philadelphia Museum of Art; and Rosen Hotels & Resorts, a Florida-based hotel company that received a loan of between $2 million and $5 million. \u2026 The program\u2019s terms were originally slated to last eight weeks and was expanded to 24 weeks, although it was left up to companies whether to use the expansion.\u201dOf the 110 million Americans living in rental households, 20 percent are at risk of eviction by Sept. 30.That is according to an analysis by the Covid-19 Eviction Defense Project, a Colorado-based community group. \u201cAfrican American and Hispanic renters are expected to be hit hardest,\u201d Renae Merle reports. \u201cCongress passed a national moratorium that has shielded about one-third of renters from eviction since late March. The renters protected under this moratorium live in buildings or homes with a mortgage that has some form of government backing. That moratorium expires Friday, but renters still have a little time. Once the ban ends, landlords are required to give renters 30 days\u2019 notice before filing an eviction complaint in court. That means the eviction paperwork won\u2019t be filed until late August. Some renters are also covered by a patchwork of state and local eviction bans that don\u2019t end until August or September.\u201dADADHouse Democrats proposed $100 billion in rental assistance, but Senate Republicans have said they will not include this in their proposal.Princeton University\u2019s Eviction Lab maintains a Covid-19 Housing Policy Scorecard that includes some helpful information about local moratoriums.Ivanka Trump\u2019s Find Something New career campaign is more hype than help.The White House adviser\u2019s initiative has been a ballyhooed centerpiece of her dad\u2019s efforts to assist the unemployed. \u201cPeople who\u2019ve lost their jobs because of the coronavirus don\u2019t need a new website.

By comparison, the increase from 1 million cases to 2 million spanned 45 days from April 28 to June 11, and the leap to 3 million then took 27 days,\u201d Anne Gearan, Marisa Iati and Jacqueline Dupree report. \u201cThe rolling seven-day average of infections has doubled in less than a month, reaching more than 66,000 new cases per day Wednesday. The U.S. death toll now exceeds 141,000.\"The president retreated from his demands to hold a large in-person convention.\u201cTrump on Thursday abruptly canceled the Republican National Convention celebrations scheduled for next month in Jacksonville, Fla.,\u201d Michael Scherer, Josh Dawsey and Colby Itkowitz report.\u00a0\u201cTrump has for months instructed his advisers to find a way to stage a loud, boisterous and packed convention celebration, after North Carolina officials said they could not guarantee such an event in Charlotte. \u2026 The president\u2019s ambition, however, ran headlong into a massive spike in coronavirus cases in Florida, growing local opposition and enormous logistical hurdles. At one point, convention planners announced they would administer daily coronavirus tests to thousands of delegates, donors and members of the media to help reduce the viral risk. That plan was later scrapped to move large portions of the celebrations to an outdoor venue. \u2026ADAD\u201cTrump advisers have repeatedly argued to him in recent days that a more cautious approach is likely to boost his popularity. Canceling the convention, they said, would also show he is taking the virus seriously. \u2026 Some White House and campaign officials were fearful of the negative press if delegates and others were infected \u2026 They also came to the conclusion that they would probably have to use the National Guard to protect the convention from protests and allow for distancing in the crowd. The president, advisers said, was less than enthusiastic about an arena or stadium that appeared less than full.\u201d (Many GOP lawmakers have said they would not attend. During his news conference, Trump also walked back a little from his insistence that schools should open on time this fall.)\u201cA Quinnipiac University poll released Thursday found 62 percent of Florida voters opposed holding the convention. Sheriff Mike Williams announced this week that he did not have the resources to provide adequate security for the event. \u2026 The city council presented yet another obstacle to the Republican plans. Just minutes before Trump\u2019s announcement, the Republican Party of Duval County sent an email asking party members to \u2018call your councilmember and tell them to support\u2019 the convention.\u201dReminder: Trump has repeatedly mocked Democrats for signaling early that they would respect public health guidance to scale back on their convention festivities. Democrats will hold a four-day convention in August that will be anchored in Milwaukee, with simulcasts from satellite locations across the country and prerecorded video. But delegates and party officials have been urged to stay home, and the in-person crowd for major speeches, including Joe Biden\u2019s acceptance of the nomination, will be small.ADADEarlier this week, Trump boasted that his administration has met most governors' requests for supplies. That's not true. Officials in Oregon, Indiana, Georgia, New Hampshire, Alaska, Montana, Wyoming, North Carolina, Maryland, Michigan, Idaho, Utah and Washington told ABC News they are either still waiting for requests to be fulfilled, had identified orders that were never filled or have made requests they understand are still being processed.Trump is expected to sign three health-care executive orders today, including two that target the pharmaceutical industry on drug pricing. White House aides spent much of yesterday fielding calls from drug company executives expressing frustration with the orders, which come as the administration pushes the industry to develop and manufacture covid-19 vaccines.

The unusual admission, contained in a court filing, said the inaccuracies \u2018undermine a central argument\u2019 in the Trump administration\u2019s case for barring New Yorkers from the programs after the state passed a law enabling undocumented immigrants to get driver\u2019s licenses,\u201d the New York Times reports. \u201cFederal officials had previously insisted that New York was an outlier in the restrictions it placed on the access the immigration authorities have to State Department of Motor Vehicles records. \u2026 But in their filing on Thursday, the government lawyers acknowledged that several other states, Washington, D.C., and some U.S. territories also limited access to motor vehicle information and had not been subject to similar clampdowns.\u00a0\u201cAgainst that backdrop, the filing said, \u2018The acting secretary of homeland security has decided to restore New York residents\u2019 access to\u2019 what is officially known as the Trusted Traveler Program \u2018effective immediately.\u2019 \u2026 \u2018Defendants deeply regret the foregoing inaccurate or misleading statements and apologize to the court and plaintiffs for the need to make these corrections at this late stage in the litigation,\u2019 said Audrey Strauss, the acting United States attorney in Manhattan. \u2026\u00a0\u201cOn Feb. 4, Mr. Trump criticized New York in his State of the Union address for not letting the police detain undocumented immigrants until federal agents could pick them up for deportation proceedings \u2026 The next day, Chad F. Wolf, the acting homeland security secretary and a favorite of Mr. Trump\u2019s for his hard-line stance on enforcement matters, said on Fox News that New Yorkers would be barred from the travel programs because of the sanctuary policies. At the time, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo condemned the move, which had the potential to slow the travel routines of at least 175,000 New Yorkers, as \u2018a form of extortion.\u2019\u201dMichael Cohen will be allowed to go back home.A federal judge on Thursday ordered Trump's ex-lawyer to be released from prison to home confinement, saying the Justice Department's move to take him back into custody earlier this month was retaliation for writing a book about his former boss. \u201cU.S. District Judge Alvin Hellerstein said Cohen must be released by 2 p.m. Friday \u2026 He has been held in a solitary setting at the federal prison in Otisville, N.Y., since being rearrested July 9,\u201d Shayna Jacobs reports.\u00a0\u201cCohen and his lawyers alleged his detention stemmed from plans to write an unflattering tell-all about the president \u2026 that would cite examples of Trump making racist and anti-Semitic comments in private settings.\u201dThe feds are trying to block the release of a documentary with a rare look into Trump\u2019s immigration crackdown.\u00a0\u201cIn early 2017, as Immigration and Customs Enforcement prepared to carry out the hard-line agenda on which President Trump had campaigned, agency leaders jumped at the chance to let two filmmakers give a behind-the-scenes look at the process,\u201d the Times reports. \u201cSome of the contentious scenes include ICE officers lying to immigrants to gain access to their homes and mocking them after taking them into custody. One shows an officer illegally picking the lock to an apartment building during a raid. \u2026 Over the next two and a half years, the couple filmed a sweeping look at the federal immigration enforcement system, discovering many inherent contradictions. They followed Border Patrol tactical agents who took pride in rescuing migrants from deadly dehydration even as the agents acknowledged that their tactics were pushing the migrants further into harm\u2019s way.

Paul, president of the Alliance for American Manufacturing, wrote in the letter. \u201cWe urge you to immediately stop the egregious outsourcing of the public infrastructure in our nation\u2019s capital and reissue the pending request for bids with the inclusion of the federal Buy American laws.\u201dADADMetro said it is not violating the \u201cBuy America\u201d provision because it is not using federal money to build the 8000-series cars. Instead it is using funding from Maryland, Virginia and the District that is dedicated for capital projects. Federal funding the transit agency gets annually for capital expenses is being earmarked for other uses.Metro said that it was still early in its process to secure a contract to build the 8000 Series, which is expected to look similar to the current 7000-series rail cars but with technological advancements including phone chargers, digital maps and advertising.But the agency said it has its own contract clause requiring a builder to create an assembly plant and keep a percentage of the total contract\u2019s value not just in-country but inside of the Mid-Atlantic region.ADAD\u201cMetro is committed to ensuring that our local region sees direct economic benefits from the dedicated funding established to support the system\u2019s infrastructure needs,\u201d Metro spokesman Dan Stessel said.The Metro contract would require 8 percent of the project to be manufactured in the Mid-Atlantic region. By contrast, the federal \u201cBuy America\u201d provision requires that 70 percent remain domestic.Build a subway car factory in D.C. area? Metro asks bidders for big contract to consider it.Metro is ordering more than 250 rail cars for its 8000 series and has options to buy up to 800 as it phases out older-model cars and modernizes its fleet. The 8000 series will replace its 2000-series cars, which were built in 1982, as well as the 3000-series cars built in 1987.ADThe first shipment of 8000-series cars could arrive in 2024, Metro has said.The 8000-series cars will be Metro\u2019s eighth model since the rail system opened four decades ago. Currently, there are no U.S.-based manufacturers of subway cars, but Kawasaki Heavy Industries Rolling Stock Company of Japan built Metro\u2019s most recent model at a plant in Lincoln, Neb. Each of the cars is valued at $2 million and the 8000-series is expected to cost as much if not more.ADLate last year, after representatives from the China Railway Rolling Stock Corp. (CRRC) began pitching their services to Metro, Congress \u2014 led by the senators representing Maryland and Virginia \u2014 passed a law banning any transit agency from contracting with a company that is not sanctioned under U.S. trade requirements.Metro\u2019s next-generation rail cars will not be made in ChinaWhile Metro cannot directly contract with Chinese companies, the Alliance for American Manufacturing claims parts from CRRC or companies from other unsanctioned countries could end up in Metro rail cars without guard rails, such as the \u201cBuy America\u201d clause because a contracted foreign builder could theoretically use parts from anywhere.ADStessel said Metro\u2019s requirement that eight percent of the 8000-series contract be manufactured regionally belies the national impact the total contract will have. Local companies will be relying on domestic parts and services to do their work, he said.ADBut Paul said it\u2019s paltry compared to what \u201cBuy America\u201d would require.\u201cWhat Metro is doing that concerns us is that it looks like it\u2019s trying to evade \u2018Buy America\u2019 rules,\" he said in an interview. \u201cYes, it is using local dollars, but it\u2019s it\u2019s able to use local dollars because in part it gets federal dollars for other needs, other capital and operating needs. And so it strikes us as a pretty devious attempt to evade the federal procurement rules.\u201dADPaul said Metro is capable of devoting much more of its contract to domestic companies. He also said a lack of U.S.-based rail car builders is just an excuse when he says there is no shortage of manufacturers that would start or move operations within the United States to acquire a $1 billion project that would last several years.\u201cIf there wasn\u2019t any capacity to build rail cars in the United States, perhaps they have an argument,\u201d Paul said. \u201cThat\u2019s simply not the case. There are plenty of qualified rail car manufacturers in the United States who can meet or exceed Metro\u2019s needs, who can deliver a great product. And those dollars will be supporting American jobs, as well as an investment in the future of transit in the D.C. area.\u201dADThe possibility that fewer jobs could go to American workers did not sit well with U.S. Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton, (D-D.C.), who chairs the House Highways and Transit subcommittee. She wrote Metro a letter on April 7 saying Metro\u2019s decision to not use \u201cBuy America\u201d requirements for the 8000-series project undermines her lobbying efforts on the agency\u2019s behalf.AD\u201cThis decision sets a dangerous precedent for similar procurements throughout the country could send valuable work opportunities abroad, endangering American companies, workers and communities,\u201d Norton wrote. \u201cMetro has long benefitted from special congressional funding in support of its capital costs, and I have supported this funding throughout my tenure in Congress.\"In a reply to the letter, Metro General Manager Paul J. Wiedefeld wrote in June that Metro is using local dollars because it was \u201ca predictable source\u201d of funding for a lengthy \u201ccritical\u201d investment. Maryland, Virginia and the District dedicate money annually for Metro\u2019s capital needs while federal funding can be more vulnerable to politics.He said he was limited in his response because Metro continues to try and secure a contract for the rail cars.Stessel, the Metro spokesman, said Thursday that the agency has not yet picked a builder.", "comment": "39 Comments", "topic": "Gridlock"}, {"cover": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/TLRUY6WHNMI6VKBFQ4RAATSBKA.jpghttps://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/TLRUY6WHNMI6VKBFQ4RAATSBKA.jpg", "title": "Why we should invite Hong Kong businesses to move to the United States", "date": "Jul 23, 2020", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/07/23/why-we-should-invite-hong-kong-businesses-move-united-states/", "keyword": "China and Security", "website": "the Washington Post", "author": "", "content": "Jonathan Schanzer is senior vice president for research at Foundation for Defense of Democracies, where Eric Lorber is senior director for FDD\u2019s Center on Economic and Financial Power.

Subscribe today.arrow-rightIn a speech to U.S. governors in February, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo warned that China was actively working to exploit American vulnerabilities at all levels. Two can play at that game.In June, China imposed its draconian national security law on Hong Kong, extending the reach of the Communist Party\u2019s security apparatus throughout the territory. Now businesses want out. A survey this month by the American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong found that 76 percent of respondents were \u201csomewhat\u201d or \u201cextremely\u201d concerned about the new national security law, and 63 percent feared that it would harm Hong Kong\u2019s business prospects. Thirty-five percent of Hong Kongers polled said they were considering plans to relocate their capital, assets or business operations. As authorities use the law to crack down on the pro-democracy movement, these sentiments are likely to grow.ADADIt\u2019s a grim story. The resulting intellectual and capital flight from China will be significant. But the United States is in a position to offer a helping hand, and it should seize the opportunity. If that flight could be directed to America, even in part, the economic benefits could be enormous.American tech companies have already made a move that points to the troubles ahead for businesses in Hong Kong. Facebook, Google and Twitter have suspended processing government requests for user data in the territory, fearing that this information could be abused by Beijing. If China extends its \u201cGreat Firewall\u201d to Hong Kong, these companies may have no choice but to leave.The tech giants are not the only businesses likely to suffer. Hong Kong is a major banking hub and a territory where global business has flourished. Financial institutions have real reasons to be concerned about Beijing\u2019s invasiveness. Banks seeking to maintain solid reputations will also loathe the prospect of being lumped in with some of the less-than-transparent counterparts operating on the mainland.ADADThere are 56 banks incorporated in Hong Kong. The banks are divided into three tiers (licensed, restricted license and deposit). Some are domiciled in China. Others are based elsewhere and already have a presence in the United States.But for those seeking a new headquarters or a greater U.S. presence, Washington should consider offering generous tax incentives. States should also consider offering additional benefits, such as subsidized construction or low-interest loans. These practices are already in place as states compete for new Amazon facilities, for example, given the potential to increase local and regional economic growth. Pacific states, in particular, should consider such inducements, since the West Coast is a natural landing spot for financial institutions and bankers.The opportunities extend beyond banks, too. Data from the Hong Kong Companies Registry indicates that in May 2020, there were about 1.3 million local companies incorporated and registered in Hong Kong. Of those companies, 850 are public. Efforts should be made, at both the state and federal levels, to woo those that would benefit the U.S. economy.ADADThe United States should not stop at businesses. Many Hong Kong residents are highly educated, with deep expertise in financial markets and other important industries. Beyond the moral imperative of assisting freedom-loving citizens of a city now under an oppressive authoritarian regime, opening our shores to Hong Kong emigres is a win-win-win for the United States. It promotes the health of the U.S. economy by adding valuable new intellectual capital, undercuts China\u2019s ability to benefit from their talents and productivity, and supports the American values of democracy and freedom.Laying out a welcome mat for Hong Kongers and their businesses does not have to be hard. It\u2019s too late to include provisions in the newly signed Hong Kong Autonomy Act, which imposes new sanctions on those undermining the rights and freedoms of Hong Kong. But Congress should consider tweaks to current legislative efforts that offer protection to the people of Hong Kong, including relaxed visa restrictions to the United States. Relaxed business restrictions should be added to the mix.Admittedly, many Hong Kongers will wish to remain in the region. Likely options include Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam, Australia or other countries that operate free of Chinese control. Some may likewise choose to go to Britain, which has also taken steps to help them leave Hong Kong.ADADBut for Hong Kong\u2019s people and businesses alike, Washington should make it clear that America is still a land of opportunity. The net effect could be an enormous transfer of wealth and intellectual property from China to the United States, rather than the other way around.

Subscribe today.arrow-rightWill Beijing follow through on these threats \u2014 and does the Chinese government face any restraints in using economic coercion as a diplomatic tool? Here\u2019s what you need to know.Beijing has increasingly relied on economic coercion In recent years, Japan, South Korea, Norway and the Philippines have all become targets of Chinese economic retaliation during disputes over territorial claims, the deployment of theater missile defense systems and support for Chinese dissidents. Beijing has increasingly relied on economic means to deter or punish foreign governments or companies that cross Chinese interests on these sensitive issues.ADADWhen the Trump administration agreed to sell Patriot missiles to Taiwan this month, China\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced Beijing would impose sanctions on Lockheed Martin Corp. the U.S. primary contractor. China\u2019s state media suggests \u201cthe sanctions will likely feature the cutoff of material supply including rare earths\u201d \u2014 a group of 17 metallic elements essential to high-tech products, including weaponry and smartphones.China is the largest exporter of these minerals, and it isn\u2019t the first time Beijing has entertained the idea of weaponizing its monopoly. Many reports claimed that in the 2010 Senkaku/Diaoyudao Islands dispute, China imposed a similar embargo to coerce Japan to release the detained Chinese trawler captain. However, Japanese import data make it difficult to interpret these claims.Why does China care so much about the South China Sea? Here are 5 reasons.Beijing is pragmatic about its commercial cloutBut the Chinese government has also been selective in applying economic sanctions. Take the case of Australia, which endorsed an independent investigation in May into the origins of the new coronavirus. In retaliation, China adopted coercive measures, including a tariff on Australian barley exports, suspension of certain beef imports and threats to prevent its citizens from visiting Australia.ADADChina is the largest export market for Australian beef and purchases roughly half of Australia\u2019s barley exports, making these two products ideal targets. In contrast, China has not targeted Australian minerals \u2014 probably because Australian companies supply around 62 percent of China\u2019s iron ore imports, far more than Brazil, the second-most important supplier. Underscoring this mutual dependence is the fact that China\u2019s post-pandemic stimulus measures probably will include new construction projects \u2014 and greater demand for iron ore to produce steel.When China has strong leverage, indicated by the degree of market dependence, and ample substitutes for the boycotted goods, it often opts to use economic coercion. Having alternative options to satisfy domestic consumers is equally crucial. In the cases of beef and barley, China can look to Russia \u2014 China expects to import 10,000 tons of beef this year from two Russian companies.Beijing taps into grass-roots furyBesides state-directed sanctions, grass-roots anger can give the Chinese government flexibility to send a strong message via consumer boycotts. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian cited violation of \u201cinspection and quarantine requirements\u201d to explain the suspension of beef from four Australian companies \u2014 while China\u2019s ambassador to Australia threatened the \u201cChinese public could avoid Australian products and universities.\u201d How coronavirus changes the political outlook in China and the U.S.Similarly, during tensions with Japan in 2012 over the Diaoyu/Senkaku islands, Beijing encouraged consumer boycotts against Japanese goods while giving permission for street demonstrations in which angry protesters damaged Japanese-branded companies in China. Japanese-branded automobiles suffered significant market share losses in China. Given deep-rooted anti-Japanese sentiment in Chinese society, Gao Hong, a Chinese scholar, observed, \u201cJapan\u2019s provocation gave rise to the Chinese public\u2019s spontaneous boycott, and public opinion deserves respect.\u201d ADADIn 2020, despite rising anger and disaffection with the United States, grass-roots action against U.S. companies seems unlikely. China is more likely to rely on tit-for-tat state-led sanctions. Here\u2019s an example. The U.S. condemned the human rights situation in Xinjiang and a new U.S. law sanctioned four Chinese officials with responsibility for policy and security in the region. Beijing\u2019s response was to impose sanctions on four U.S. officials close to President Trump \u2014 all of whom have been critical of the situation in Xinjiang.In recent disputes over U.S. actions against Huawei and the protests in Hong Kong, Chinese social media put out sporadic calls to retaliate by boycotting Apple. However, systematic coercion from the Chinese government appears counterproductive, at least when it comes to Apple, which is a key manufacturing partner in China. A state-directed retaliation probably would risk accelerating Apple\u2019s move to \u201cdiversify their manufacturing base\u201d and shift production away from China.America weaponized the global financial system. Now other countries are fighting back.Weaponized interdependence can backfireBeijing takes a calculated risk in wielding economic coercion. Scholars like Daniel Drezner have long warned that the Chinese government cannot credibly threaten to exercise its financial influence \u2014 say, by slashing its holdings of U.S. Treasurys \u2014 without crippling China\u2019s own interests in the process. Such mutual dependency poses constraints on China\u2019s financial statecraft.ADADEfforts to \u201cweaponize interdependence\u201d can backfire by prompting countries to reduce their mutual dependence and accelerate the process of decoupling. Even when China\u2019s economic statecraft helps advance its immediate goal, such as various apologies by multinational companies, foreign businesses may resort to risk-management strategies, including diversification of manufacturing and markets.Weighing against Beijing\u2019s desire to use commerce as a weapon are concerns about stabilizing the economy and preserving foreign investment. In April, foreign direct investment in China increased 8.6 percent over 2019 levels to $10.14 billion, largely driven by increased investment from Southeast Asian nations. A month later, China\u2019s ambassador to the European Union emphasized China\u2019s sincere efforts for reaching a comprehensive E.U. investment agreement.Despite tensions at the national level, local governments in China still remain \u201cvery welcoming\u201d to U.S. and other foreign investors. The Ministry of Commerce also urged local authorities to better accommodate foreign companies in their efforts to restart operations amid the pandemic. With Beijing looking at foreign investment as part of China\u2019s pandemic economic recovery, China\u2019s economic retaliation measures may turn out to be more symbolic than powerful.The TMC newsletter has moved!

Subscribe today.arrow-rightComing this morning: Economists and markets are bracing for some of the worst GDP numbers since the Great Depression when the Commerce Department releases its estimate for how much the economy shrank between April and June, Rachel Siegel and Andrew Van Dam report.It comes as the U.S. death toll from the novel coronavirus hit nearly 150,000: \u201cExperts warn that \u00a0the GDP release shouldn\u2019t just be seen in the rear view mirror, but should stand as a cautionary tale of what\u2019s at stake if the recovery slips away,\u201d our colleagues write.At The White HouseTILTING AT MEDICINES: As the American death toll from the novel coronavirus continues rising, President Trump is stubbornly clinging to the unproven benefits of an anti-malarial drug that his own government and health advisers say shouldn't be used to treat the virus.ADADWith his attacks on masks seemingly behind him, Trump has latched onto hydroxycholorquine as the latest cudgel in the culture war fueling the politicization of the pandemic.\u201cI happen to be a believer in hydroxy.\u00a0I used it.\u00a0I had no problem.\u00a0I happen to be a believer.\u00a0Many, many people agree with me.\u00a0 A great test just came out from the Ford clinic in Michigan \u2014 very respected.\u00a0 We\u2019ll see how it is,\u201d Trump told reporters before his Marine One Departure for Texas yesterday.The comments came after Trump on Tuesday defended his praise of a controversial Houston doctor who believes the drug is a cure for covid-19, and touted the dangers of \u201cdemon sperm.\u201dThere is no solid scientific evidence hydroxychloroquine should be used to treat covid-19 and the Food and Drug Administration last month revoked an emergency use authorization for it.Why is this happening? \u201cI think it has turned into an argument within the broader culture war,\u201d a Trump campaign source told Power Up of Trump's obsession with the therapeutic, claiming the debate over the drug underlined \u201cthe politicization of approved medication, both from some in the media and people from the left.\u201dThis aide argued Trump's thinking about the unproven drug is similar to his views of \u201cRight to Try,\u201d a 2018 law championed by religious conservatives that gives terminally ill people the ability to seek access to experimental treatments. Vice President Pence signed a state Right to Try law as Indiana's governor and was a strong proponent of the federal legislationADAD\u201cThe way [Trump] has described [hydroxychloriquine] has always been in line with how he talks about Right to Try, legislation that has been almost universally praised,\u201d the source explained.\u00a0A senior administration official pushed back on the argument that Trump's unfounded attachment to the drug is simply a talking point for the president looking for a silver lining in the crisis. The official argued the anti-malarial only became a political battle \u201cbecause Trump wrapped his arms around it.\u201d\u00a0\u201cHis intention was to give America hope and wrap his hands around how to cure people,\u201d the official said. \u201cYou don\u2019t see him grabbing onto convalescent plasma, which has more doctors behind it \u2014 he\u2019s not getting close to that because he knows what will happen,\" the official argued, predicting the media and liberals would pan the therapy if Trump embraced it. \"It is indeed a political fight.\u201d\u00a0The FDA is \u201cnearing a decision to authorize emergency use of antibody-rich blood plasma from recovered Covid-19 patients for treating those infected with the coronavirus, people familiar with the matter said,\u201d the Wall Street Journal's Amy Dockser Marcus and Thomas Burton report.\u00a0However: \u201cPreliminary studies have found convalescent plasma is generally safe to use and appears to improve the survival of hospitalized patients.\u201dTeam science: Some of the president's top doctors and allies maintain that no matter what the president says, the scientific evidence shows hydroxychloroquine is not an effective treatment for coronovarius.\u00a0\u201cI'm very explicit and unambiguous when we say we've got to follow the science,\u201d Anthony S. Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases who Trump has sidelined as the pandemic worsens, said during an interview with NBC News's Andrea Mitchell. \u201cIf a study that's a good study comes out and shows efficacy and safety for hydroxychloroquine or any other drug that we do \u2014 if you do it in the right way you accept the scientific data. But right now today, the cumulative scientific data that has been put together and done over a number of different studies has shown no efficacy.\u201d\u00a0\u201cI think at this point, we can definitively say hydroxychloroquine doesn't work. I'm not sure what more we need to do,\u201d former FDA commissioner Scott Gottlieb, who served under Trump, told MSNBC's Stephanie Ruhle.\u00a0Not so fast: White House trade adviser Peter Navarro, a vocal proponent of hydroxchloroquine, told CNN yesterday the administration is \u201csitting on millions of doses\u201d of the drug. Citing a study from Detroit's Henry Ford Medical Center scientists have widely criticized as flawed, Navarro continues to champion the medicine.ADAD\"We're in the middle of a pandemic where over 1,000 Americans died today. 1,000 Americans died yesterday. And if you have a medicine that there's relatively little or no downside risk and possible upside; why would you not let the American people have it?\" Navarro said yesterday.\u00a0Navarro has continued to pressure the FDA to reverse course on its decision to rescind emergency authorization for hydroxychloroquine. Earlier this week, the administration tapped Eastman Kodak, the iconic photography company, to produce ingredients for generic drugs \u2013 including hydroxychloroquine. The company won a $765 million government loan under the Defense Production Act to \u201chelp expedite domestic production of drugs that can treat a variety of medical conditions and loosen the U.S. reliance on foreign sources,\u201d per the Wall Street Journal's Rachael Levy.\u00a0Some Republicans on Capitol Hill have also embraced hydroxychloroquine, including Texas Rep. Louie Gohmert (R) who confirmed yesterday that\u00a0 he tested positive for coronavirus. He told Fox New's Sean Hannity that he was taking the anti-malarial.\u201cMy doctor and I are all in,\u201d Gohmert said \u00a0Wednesday evening, adding that he would start taking the drug \u201cin the next day or two.\u201d\u201cI feel okay. I\u2019m a little tired,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if you know the symptoms of covid-19, I don\u2019t have any of them,\" he added.Hydroxychloroquine also became a flash point during yesterday's blockbuster hearing in the House with the nation's top tech CEOs. \u00a0ADADBoth parties delivered a tongue lashing to the heads of Facebook, Twitter, Google and Amazon (Jeff Bezos, Amazon's owner, also owns The Washington Post.) But Republican lawmakers repeatedly steered the conversation toward alleged anti-conservative bias on the tech platforms and questioned why companies are increasingly removing from their sites disinformation and conspiracy theories.Twitter and Google stoked the ire of conservatives \u2014 including Donald Trump Jr. and his dad, who amplified the information \u2014 \u00a0after removing a viral video showing doctors propagating unsubstantiated information about the novel coronavirus. Rep. Greg Steube (R-Fla.) pressed Google's Sundar Pichai on why YouTube, which is owned by Google, \u201cthinks it's appropriate to silence physicians\u201d who are providing \u201ctheir opinion on what can help and cure people\u201d afraid of or suffering from the coronavirus.\u00a0\u201cCongressman, we believe in freedom of expression and there's a lot of debate on YouTube about effective ways to deal with covid-19,\u201d Pichai responded. \u201cWe allow robust debate. But during a pandemic, we look to local health authorities \u2014 so for example, in the U.S., the CDC for guidelines around medical misinformation that could cause harm in the real world.\u201dAnd Rep. F. James Sensenbrenner Jr. (Wis.), the ranking Republican on the House Judiciary panel's antitrust subcommittee, asked Facebook head Mark Zuckerberg to explain why Donald Trump Jr.'s Twitter account was suspended for sharing a viral video promoting \u00a0hydroxychloroquine.\u00a0ADAD\u201cCongressman, first, to be clear, I think what you might be referring to happened on Twitter, so it\u2019s hard for me to speak to that,\u201d Zuckerberg said. \u201cStating that there's a proven cure for covid \u2014 when there is in fact none \u2014 might encourage somebody to take something which could have adverse effects \u2026 So we do take that down. \" \n  \n  \n  You are reading the Power Up newsletter. \n  Not a regular subscriber? \n   \n   \n    \n   \n   \n  \n \nThe PoliciesRELIEF PLAN TALKS STUCK: \u201cNegotiations on a new coronavirus relief bill hit an impasse on Capitol Hill, leaving no clear path forward even as millions of Americans face a sudden drop in unemployment benefits, and the economy teeters on the brink,\u201d Erica Werner, Jeff Stein, Seung Min Kim and Rachael Bade report.This means millions of Americans will almost certainly be affected: Twenty million jobless Americans will lose $600 weekly in enhanced unemployment benefits that Congress approved in March. A nationwide moratorium on evictions also expired last week.The two sides remain trillions apart: \u201cAfter a day of meetings, all parties declared their differences all but irreconcilable. Democrats shot down the idea of a short-term fix for unemployment insurance and the eviction moratorium, which [Trump] had announced earlier he would support,\u201d our colleagues write.ADADRepublicans continue to struggle to coalesce around their evolving plan: \u201c[Senate Majority Leader Mitch] McConnell said in his PBS interview that there are about 20 GOP senators who would prefer to take no additional action because of deficit concerns.\u201dThe blame game is fully underway: \u201cShe\u2019ll just refuse to legislate until the election and wish American families good luck dealing with the pandemic,\u201d McConnell said, blasting House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.). \"\u201cThis absurd, nasty insinuation by the Republican leader doesn\u2019t pass the laugh test,\u201d Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) retorted.On The HillTECH CEOS GET GRILLED: \u201cThe leaders of Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google took a brutal political lashing as Democrats and Republicans confronted the executives for wielding their market power to crush competitors and amass data, customers and sky-high profits,\u201d Tony Romm reports.ADLawmakers had the receipts: \u201cThe rare interrogation played out over the course of a nearly six-hour hearing, with lawmakers on the House\u2019s top antitrust subcommittee coming armed with millions of documents, hundreds of hours of interviews and in some cases the once-private messages of Silicon Valley\u2019s elite chiefs.\u201dWhat's coming next could hurt even more: \u201cOur founders would not bow before a king. Nor should we bow before the emperors of the online economy,\u201d said Rep. David N. Cicilline (D-R.I.). Cicilline\u00a0is next month expected to release a lengthy report of on panel's probe, including the millions of documents it has obtained.Key moments:ADDemocrats repeatedly confronted Zuckerberg with his own past emails: \u201cRep. Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.), the top lawmaker on the House Judiciary Committee, brought up a 2012 message in which Zuckerberg apparently said he sought to acquire Instagram, which at the time was a rival photo-sharing app, out of fear that it could \u2018meaningfully hurt us.\u2019 Later, Rep. Joe Neguse (D-Colo.) pointed to other Facebook communications that described the company\u2019s acquisition strategy generally as \u2018a land grab.\u2019\u201dADFrom the New York Times's Kara Swisher:Bezos was dragged over whether his company misled the panel: \u201cThe e-commerce giant previously told lawmakers it does not tap data from third-party sellers to boost sales of its own products. But Democratic Rep. Pramila Jayapal (Wash.) brought up public reports that indicated to the contrary, prompting Bezos \u2014 delivering his first-ever testimony to Congress \u2014 to offer a striking admission of potential fault.\u201dAD\u201cWhat I can tell you is we have a policy against using seller-specific data to aid our private label business,\u201d said Bezos, who also owns The Post. \u201cBut I can\u2019t guarantee you that policy has never been violated.\u201dRepublicans largely focused on unproven charges that some tech companies censor conservatives: The industry vehemently denies such accusations.Outside the BeltwayMOST FEDERAL AGENTS WILL LEAVE PORTLAND: \u201cThe governor of Oregon and the Trump administration announced an agreement aimed at de-escalating tensions outside the federal courthouse in Portland, where federal agents have clashed with demonstrators during nightly unrest,\u201d Mark Berman, Nick Miroff, Marissa J. Lang and David A. Fahrenthold report.But the timing remains unclear: \u201cAs part of the agreement, officials said, most Department of Homeland Security agents will leave the front lines around the courthouse and withdraw from Portland entirely if what they have deemed nightly rioting \u00adceases,\u201d our colleagues write.More details: \u201cGov. Kate Brown (D) said the agents would pull out of downtown Thursday and depart the city soon thereafter. But acting DHS secretary Chad Wolf said the withdrawal was still a question of if, not when. He said federal officials would pull back from Portland \u2018should circumstances on the ground significantly improve,\u2019 as state troopers move to protect the courthouse.\u201d\u00a0The PeopleMASKS ARE NOW MANDATORY ON THE HOUSE FLOOR: \u201c[Pelosi] announced that all lawmakers will now be required to wear a mask while appearing on the chamber floor, a decision spurred by the news that a Republican congressman who has spurned facial coverings had tested positive for the coronavirus,\u201d Paul Kane and Colby Itkowitz report.Gohmert, who was criticized previously for going maskless in the Capitol, gathered his staff in person to relay his diagnosis: The congressman told his aides he was positive after Politico broke the story. \u00a0An aide later told the publication's Jake Sherman to \u201cask how often were people berated for wearing masks,\u201d insisting that Gohmert requires staff to work physically in his Capitol office, something other lawmakers are not requiring during the pandemic.Gohmert denied to Hannity last night that aides in his office were pressured not to wear masks, saying \u201cthat's a lie.\"Yet he's spread dubious information: Gohmert claimed wearing a mask makes it more, not less, likely someone will get infected. (This claim has been widely debunked.)Where is Gohmert now? The Republican is among a dozen House members who sleep in their offices. But some of his colleagues voiced concern that continuing to do so would risk further spreading the virus. But his chief of staff told The Washington Examiner no one in his office had symptoms, and the congressman was driving back to Texas.In the MediaWHAT ELSE YOU NEED TO KNOW:President Obama is expected to eulogize John Lewis later today: \u201cA source with knowledge of President Barack Obama\u2019s plans says he is expected to speak at Rep. John Lewis\u2019 funeral \u2026,\u201d the Atlanta Journal-Constitution's Tia Mitchell reports. \u201cAnother news outlet in Atlanta also reported Obama would be attending [today's] service, with former president George Bush and President Bill Clinton.\u201dThe Post will have live coverage from Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta: A special report will begin at 10:30 a.m. Eastern with the funeral set to begin around 11 a.m..

Robert Menendez (N.J.), said the administration had \u201cabetted\u201d Russian President Vladimir Putin by withdrawing the troops from Germany. He also took aim at the central focus of Pompeo\u2019s tenure, Iran, noting that the country \u201cis much closer to a nuclear bomb than when you came into office,\u201d and criticized Pompeo\u2019s \u201cmaximum pressure campaign\u201d for failing to stop Iran\u2019s aggressive actions in the Middle East.ADADMenendez said that for all of Pompeo\u2019s \u201cbluster against China,\u201d it has not stopped Beijing\u2019s \u201cmarch in the South China Sea\u201d or its \u201csuppressing and oppressing its own people\u201d in Hong Kong.\u201cUnder your watch, the United States has faced setback after setback on the world stage, ceding leverage and influence to our stated adversaries,\u201d Menendez said.Pompeo flatly rejected that the administration had helped Putin in any way, saying no U.S. administration in history has been tougher on Russia and boasting that \u201c300 Russians who were in Syria\u201d are \u201cno longer on the planet,\u201d in reference to a 2018 skirmish in Syria that resulted in the United States\u2019 killing of dozens of Russian military contractors.AD\u201cThis administration has acted to protect our interests and our friends,\u201d Pompeo said in his testimony.ADOn the U.S. withdrawal in Germany, which President Trump has complained has not paid its fair share for its own defense, Pompeo noted that U.S. troops would be moved to other areas in Europe, including closer to Russia\u2019s border. U.S. forces will move to Italy, Belgium and back to the United States, according to the Pentagon.Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.) noted that Russia was the only country that \u201cpublicly supported\u201d the removal of troops. Pompeo responded that the U.S. troops would be \u201cfully available\u201d to be redeployed if needed, and noted the Kremlin was irritated that some troops would be moved closer to the Russian border.ADIn underscoring his knowledge of the issue, Pompeo said, \u201cI fought on the border of East Germany\u201d during his service in the Army during the Cold War. Shaheen shot back, noting that \u201cyour unit is coming back to the United States\u201d as a result of the policy change.ADMenendez asked Pompeo if he pressed Russian officials about allegations that Moscow offered bounties to the Afghan Taliban to kill U.S. and coalition soldiers there. Pompeo refused to say if he specifically brought up that allegation but said he broadly raises U.S. concerns with his Russian counterparts on a regular basis.This week, Trump told an Axios reporter that he did not raise the bounty issue in his discussions with Putin because he questioned the intelligence.ADPompeo also acknowledged that he recommended that the State Department\u2019s internal watchdog be fired. The inspector general, Steve Linick, was looking into allegations that Pompeo and his wife, Susan, inappropriately had staff and diplomatic security do personal chores for them, such as picking up takeout and other errands, and whether Pompeo improperly pushed through arms sales packages to Saudi Arabia over the objections of Congress.ADPompeo denied any knowledge of Linick\u2019s investigations, with the exception of the Saudi arms probe, but said that wasn\u2019t the motivation for his decision.Republicans broadly defended the Trump administration\u2019s record on foreign policy, with the exception of Sen. Mitt Romney (Utah), who criticized Trump\u2019s \u201cfawning praise\u201d of Chinese President Xi Jinping and the troop withdrawal in Germany. Romney said he had heard \u201cfrom the highest levels of the German government\u201d that the decision was seen as an insult to an important ally.Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) asked Pompeo about the appropriateness of Trump\u2019s suggestion on Twitter on Thursday that the U.S. presidential election in November should be delayed.

According to a Pew survey of respondents in 32 countries, 64 percent of people said they had no confidence in Trump as the United States\u2019 leader. Those grim views are particularly acute in Europe, where Trump\u2019s predecessor Barack Obama was far more popular. A December 2019 YouGov poll in Germany found that Trump was perceived as a greater threat than autocrats in Moscow, Beijing and Pyongyang.These polls were conducted before the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, which has all the more soured global attitudes toward Trump\u2019s America, site of the world\u2019s single largest death toll and a sprawling, calamitous swath of infections that seemingly has no end in sight.\u201cPeople are stunned about the effect of incapable leadership, or of polarizing leadership, of not being able to unify and get the forces aligned so you can address the problem [of the coronavirus],\u201d Thomas Kleine-Brockhoff, a vice president of the German Marshall Fund and director of its Berlin office, said to my colleague Dan Balz. \u201cAnd that, of course, results in a nosedive in how you view [the United States]. What you\u2019re seeing is a collapse of soft power of America.\u201dADADThe country with soft power to spare is Germany, which has managed the coronavirus with technocratic efficiency and a degree of unity wholly absent in the United States. \u201cIts response to the pandemic,\u201d wrote Ruchir Sharma, chief global strategist at Morgan Stanley, \u201chas highlighted pre-existing strengths: efficient government, low debt, a reputation for industrial excellence that protects its exports even as global trade falls, and a growing capacity to create domestic tech companies in a world dominated by the American and Chinese internet giants.\u201dPolitical leadership is, of course, vital. \u201cWhen you read the latest results in this report on how the world rates the leadership of major global powers, the leaders who presented the case for the most certainty did the best,\u201d wrote Mohamed Younis, Gallup\u2019s editor in chief. \u201cLongtime German chancellor Angela Merkel, loved or hated, has been one of the most predictable leaders in highly uncertain times in both Europe and the global order.\u201dThat\u2019s all the more true during the pandemic, which has seen Merkel\u2019s domestic popularity surge in the twilight of her political career. \u201cThe characteristics that distinguish her have come to the fore in the pandemic, which is measured, facts-based, evidence-based, consensus-oriented leadership,\u201d Constanze Stelzenm\u00fcller, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said to my colleague Loveday Morris.ADADUnlike Trump, she adroitly navigated Germany\u2019s complex federal system, sternly pushing for stricter measures and lockdowns than some local leaders would have contemplated. \u201cGermany wouldn\u2019t have weathered it so well had she not worked very hard at buying the scenery to get all the minister presidents in line,\u201d Stelzenm\u00fcller added.As a consequence, along with the lead role she played in securing a major E.U. budget deal last week, Merkel seems set to depart the political scene with a far rosier legacy than what her critics \u2014 including Trump \u2014 predicted. \u201cIt\u2019s probably a first that after 16 years or 15 years, a chancellor has a chance to ride into a glorious sunset and not into a thunderstorm,\u201d Stefan Kornelius, Merkel\u2019s authorized biographer, told Morris.The same cannot be said for Trump, whose flailing reelection campaign has collided with a public health disaster. \u201cPeople close to Trump, many speaking anonymously to share candid discussions and impressions, say the president\u2019s inability to wholly address the crisis is due to his almost pathological unwillingness to admit error; a positive feedback loop of overly rosy assessments and data from advisers and Fox News; and a penchant for magical thinking that prevented him from fully engaging with the pandemic,\u201d my colleagues Philip Rucker and Ashley Parker reported.ADAD\u201cThe irony is that if he\u2019d just performed with minimal competence and just mouthed words about national unity, he actually could be in a pretty strong position right now, where the economy is reopening, where jobs are coming back,\u201d Ben Rhodes, a deputy national security adviser to Obama, told them. \u201cAnd he just could not do it.\u201dBeyond the pandemic, though, experts see Trump as only the catalyst for a shifting global conversation about U.S. power in the world. \u201cI think the U.S. is seen from my perspective as being involved in its own internal reckoning \u2014 like the rest of the world doesn\u2019t really exist,\u201d Robin Niblett, director and chief executive of Chatham House, a think tank in London, said to Balz. \u201cIt\u2019s America trying to battle with historical and contemporary demons that as much as anything are a result of its own internal contradictions and tensions and strengths and weaknesses.\u201d He added that Trump represented, simply, a rude awakening.\u201cWho would ever take that seriously after this?\u201d Matt Duss, foreign policy adviser to Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), told the Nation, referring to the United States\u2019 handling of the pandemic. \u201cThis idea of America as this unparalleled and supremely competent global hegemon is over.\u201dRead more: The echoes of Hong Kong in PortlandThe U.S. ramps up its confrontation with ChinaDid Europe have its \u2018Hamiltonian\u2019 moment?

According to a Pew survey of respondents in 32 countries, 64 percent of people said they had no confidence in Trump as the United States\u2019 leader. Those grim views are particularly acute in Europe, where Trump\u2019s predecessor Barack Obama was far more popular. A December 2019 YouGov poll in Germany found that Trump was perceived as a greater threat than autocrats in Moscow, Beijing and Pyongyang.These polls were conducted before the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, which has all the more soured global attitudes toward Trump\u2019s America, site of the world\u2019s single largest death toll and a sprawling, calamitous swath of infections that seemingly has no end in sight.\u201cPeople are stunned about the effect of incapable leadership, or of polarizing leadership, of not being able to unify and get the forces aligned so you can address the problem [of the coronavirus],\u201d Thomas Kleine-Brockhoff, a vice president of the German Marshall Fund and director of its Berlin office, said to my colleague Dan Balz. \u201cAnd that, of course, results in a nosedive in how you view [the United States]. What you\u2019re seeing is a collapse of soft power of America.\u201dADADThe country with soft power to spare is Germany, which has managed the coronavirus with technocratic efficiency and a degree of unity wholly absent in the United States. \u201cIts response to the pandemic,\u201d wrote Ruchir Sharma, chief global strategist at Morgan Stanley, \u201chas highlighted pre-existing strengths: efficient government, low debt, a reputation for industrial excellence that protects its exports even as global trade falls, and a growing capacity to create domestic tech companies in a world dominated by the American and Chinese internet giants.\u201dPolitical leadership is, of course, vital. \u201cWhen you read the latest results in this report on how the world rates the leadership of major global powers, the leaders who presented the case for the most certainty did the best,\u201d wrote Mohamed Younis, Gallup\u2019s editor in chief. \u201cLongtime German chancellor Angela Merkel, loved or hated, has been one of the most predictable leaders in highly uncertain times in both Europe and the global order.\u201dThat\u2019s all the more true during the pandemic, which has seen Merkel\u2019s domestic popularity surge in the twilight of her political career. \u201cThe characteristics that distinguish her have come to the fore in the pandemic, which is measured, facts-based, evidence-based, consensus-oriented leadership,\u201d Constanze Stelzenm\u00fcller, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said to my colleague Loveday Morris.ADADUnlike Trump, she adroitly navigated Germany\u2019s complex federal system, sternly pushing for stricter measures and lockdowns than some local leaders would have contemplated. \u201cGermany wouldn\u2019t have weathered it so well had she not worked very hard at buying the scenery to get all the minister presidents in line,\u201d Stelzenm\u00fcller added.As a consequence, along with the lead role she played in securing a major E.U. budget deal last week, Merkel seems set to depart the political scene with a far rosier legacy than what her critics \u2014 including Trump \u2014 predicted. \u201cIt\u2019s probably a first that after 16 years or 15 years, a chancellor has a chance to ride into a glorious sunset and not into a thunderstorm,\u201d Stefan Kornelius, Merkel\u2019s authorized biographer, told Morris.The same cannot be said for Trump, whose flailing reelection campaign has collided with a public health disaster. \u201cPeople close to Trump, many speaking anonymously to share candid discussions and impressions, say the president\u2019s inability to wholly address the crisis is due to his almost pathological unwillingness to admit error; a positive feedback loop of overly rosy assessments and data from advisers and Fox News; and a penchant for magical thinking that prevented him from fully engaging with the pandemic,\u201d my colleagues Philip Rucker and Ashley Parker reported.ADAD\u201cThe irony is that if he\u2019d just performed with minimal competence and just mouthed words about national unity, he actually could be in a pretty strong position right now, where the economy is reopening, where jobs are coming back,\u201d Ben Rhodes, a deputy national security adviser to Obama, told them. \u201cAnd he just could not do it.\u201dBeyond the pandemic, though, experts see Trump as only the catalyst for a shifting global conversation about U.S. power in the world. \u201cI think the U.S. is seen from my perspective as being involved in its own internal reckoning \u2014 like the rest of the world doesn\u2019t really exist,\u201d Robin Niblett, director and chief executive of Chatham House, a think tank in London, said to Balz. \u201cIt\u2019s America trying to battle with historical and contemporary demons that as much as anything are a result of its own internal contradictions and tensions and strengths and weaknesses.\u201d He added that Trump represented, simply, a rude awakening.\u201cWho would ever take that seriously after this?\u201d Matt Duss, foreign policy adviser to Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), told the Nation, referring to the United States\u2019 handling of the pandemic. \u201cThis idea of America as this unparalleled and supremely competent global hegemon is over.\u201dRead more: The echoes of Hong Kong in PortlandThe U.S. ramps up its confrontation with ChinaDid Europe have its \u2018Hamiltonian\u2019 moment?

She got back results this weekend that showed Joe Biden leads there by 1 percentage point, 47 percent to 46 percent. More importantly for her job, as the operative in charge of safeguarding her party\u2019s House majority, Rep. Roger Williams (R) only led his challenger Julie Oliver by 2 points, 45 percent to 43 percent. Both findings are within the margin of error, but this is significant because that race is not on the DCCC\u2019s public list of targets.\u201cWe're constantly testing to figure out what the outer contours are of our battlefield right now,\u201d Guinn said in an interview, 100 days out from the election. \u201cWe're seeing really, really promising numbers in places that we thought were maybe on the outer edges of our battlefield.\u201dSupport our journalism. Subscribe today.arrow-rightWith public polls showing Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee, ahead nationally by double digits \u2013 and even leading Trump in red states such as Texas, Arizona and North Carolina \u2013 Democrats feel increasingly confident that they will be able to expand their majority in the House.Republicans would need a net gain of 20 seats to win back the House. Earlier in the election cycle, GOP operatives argued that this was doable because Democrats must defend 31 House seats in districts that Trump carried in 2016. Indeed, several first-term Democratic members who won in ruby-red areas during the 2018 midterms face difficult contests, and a few are expected to lose. But the national environment has helped shore up Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s hold on her gavel.ADADDemocrats say Trump\u2019s botched handling of the novel coronavirus pandemic and the national reckoning on race since George Floyd was killed on Memorial Day have helped to put new pick-up opportunities on the map, especially in suburban areas.\u201cWe took back the House going on offense in the suburbs. We started the cycle looking to shore up the districts that we won in 2018. And now we are looking very aggressively, further and further, into the suburbs,\u201d said Guinn. \u201cWhere Trump's numbers are faltering the most is in the suburbs, and that has a pretty direct correlation to where we are seeing increasing opportunity. A lot of the seats that we\u2019ve worked really hard to put in play are being impacted by Trump's numbers. The revolt of the suburbs is very real. Texas is a case study or a microcosm of it, but it\u2019s what we're seeing all across the country, including in Indianapolis, St. Louis and Phoenix.\u201dRep. Cheri Bustos (D-Ill.), the chair of the DCCC, credited early investments and preparation, including recruiting high-quality candidates, as much as the national environment, for positioning Democrats to gain seats. \u201cWe've always had a plan, no matter what Trump's numbers were or no matter who ended up being our nominee, but you capitalize on every opportunity that may present itself, and in this case, we're uniquely suited to put seats all over the country in play because of Trump\u2019s numbers going down,\u201d Bustos said in an interview. \u201cEarly on, we felt confident about being able to hang on to our majority. But growing our majority by any decent number, we thought that was going to be pretty hard. When you flip 40 seats in the previous cycle, you kind of think, well, what else is out there ?\u00a0ADAD\u201cThese seats are in play because we put them in play,\u201d she added. \u201cWe're in a position where we've got the right people, we\u2019ve got the right message and we will have the resources to make sure that people know that.\u201dGuinn and Bustos provided The Daily 202 a first look at a five-page memo outlining their view of the congressional battlefield, and I spoke with both by phone over the weekend. The memo includes some other internal polling numbers that show Democratic candidates either leading, tied or within the margin of error in 13 GOP-held districts from Michigan, Minnesota and Montana to Nebraska, New Jersey and New York. (Read the memo here.)The committee says it has already invested in 73 districts this year, with a staff of 325 spread across 20 states. The DCCC currently plans to target 47 GOP-held districts. The committee has named 30 candidates in those places to its Red to Blue program, which gives them access to more donors and extra assistance from the national party. Of them, 26 are women and 12 are members of minority groups. The DCCC said 24 of the 30 outraised their GOP rivals in the second quarter, and 14 had more cash on hand than their opponents.ADADGOP operatives involved in House races say the presidential race will definitely tighten, and many of the members who prevailed in 2018 now have records to attack that they did not two years ago. Republicans also note that, even if Trump does not recover, several Democratic incumbents are still running in places that the president could win by double digits, such as Reps. Kendra Horn in Oklahoma, Anthony Brindisi in New York, Xochitl Torres Small in New Mexico and Collin Peterson in Minnesota.\u00a0\u201cOver the next 100 days House Democrats are going to find voters want no part of their radical agenda that has focused on raising taxes, backing government-run health care and standing with dangerous criminals instead of law enforcement,\u201d said National Republican Congressional Committee spokesman Michael McAdams.The national climate has improved markedly for Democrats since the start of the year. At the beginning of March, during the brief moment when Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) looked like he might actually win the Democratic nomination, there was widespread establishment concern that he could cost the party seats in the suburbs of places like Houston. In December, many Democrats representing districts carried by Trump were nervous and anxious about voting to impeach the president.ADADAn NBC-Wall Street Journal poll conducted this month showed Democrats leading Republicans on the generic congressional ballot by four points, as Biden led by 11 points nationally.Democrats see several opportunities in Texas. The DCCC opened an office in the capital of Austin in April 2019. Six GOP incumbents are retiring, and winning open seats is usually easier than defeating a sitting member.For example, Democrats are targeting a suburban Houston district, which Trump won by eight points in 2016, that is being vacated by retiring GOP Rep. Pete Olson. Their nominee is Sri Preston Kulkarni, a former diplomat. Democrats also feel confident they will pick up the border district represented by retiring Republican Rep. Will Hurd, where Gina Ortiz Jones, who lost last time by less than one point in 2018, is running again. And they are targeting an open seat being vacated by GOP Rep. Kenny Marchant in the suburbs between Fort Worth and Dallas, as well as those held by Reps. Michael McCaul and John Carter, though both of those are more of a stretch. Democrats are also high on Wendy Davis, who ran for Texas governor in 2014 and is challenging GOP Rep. Chip Roy in the suburbs of San Antonio and Austin.ADADHouse Democratic operatives predict that health care will again be the top issue, which worked well for them in 2018. They believe Trump\u2019s support for a lawsuit led by the state of Texas to throw out the Affordable Care Act will work to their advantage. The Trump administration argued in a court filing last month that anyone who voted for the 2017 tax bill did so with the intention of getting rid of the ACA.\u00a0\u201cDemocrats have become the party of health care at a time where that is the number one issue, at a time we're in the middle of a pandemic and at a time where you've got the president of the United States talking about ingesting bleach,\u201d said Bustos. \u201cThere could not be a clearer contrast on the biggest, most important issue. House Republicans have been some of the most irresponsible voices during this crisis, and they will own that record.\u201dHouse Democrats have a massive fundraising advantage.\u00a0The\u00a0front-line Democrats raised more than $35 million in the second quarter and finished June with more than $126 million cash on hand. According to the DCCC, all the Republican candidates running against them raised about $18 million and had $25 million cash on hand. Bustos and Guinn said this fundraising advantage allows vulnerable first-termers like Brindisi and Reps. Max Rose in New York and Joe Cunningham in South Carolina to run commercials aimed at increasing their favorability before an onslaught of GOP attack ads can define them. The Democratic campaign committee also has $94 million on hand while the GOP has $61 million \u2014 a $33 million cash advantage.ADADSenior House Republicans have been pleading with the Republican National Committee and the Trump campaign to provide financial help as Democrats vastly outraise the GOP, but top campaign officials are so far declining to commit. \u201cHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) has been prodding the RNC to write a check to the National Republican Congressional Committee \u2014 a request he has made multiple times. McCarthy specifically has asked Jared Kushner, President Trump\u2019s son-in-law and senior adviser, to make a financial commitment to the House GOP,\u201d Rachael Bade, Josh Dawsey and Michelle Ye Hee Lee reported on Saturday. \u201cBut Kushner, who oversees such decisions and has a greater say than RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel, has refused thus far, the officials say. While the Trump campaign and the RNC have brought in record amounts of money, some Trump officials see donating to the House as a wasteful investment as the GOP\u2019s chances of reclaiming the majority sharply deteriorate. \u2026\u201cSome Republicans have speculated that Trump officials are trying to use the money as leverage to ensure Republicans stick with the president. Privately, GOP lawmakers on both sides of the Capitol have griped about Trump\u2019s handling of the pandemic and penchant for stirring up other controversies, including his recent defense of Confederate statues. By holding the money up, Trump officials can ensure loyalty, said these Republicans, who like others spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private talks.\u201dBustos and Guinn said adapting to run a campaign during a pandemic remains the biggest challenge facing candidates and committees. The national party has deployed \u201cMobilization Directors\u201d to more than 30 districts, earlier than originally planned, with an emphasis on getting volunteers to engage digitally. The DCCC launched a \u201cVirtual Action Center\u201d in May aimed at making it easier for grass-roots volunteers to engage in campaigns. By their count, more than 50,000 people have used the new portal to volunteer, including about 22,000 individual volunteers who signed up for 489 virtual campaign events last month alone.ADADBustos represents one of the 31 districts held by Democrats that Trump carried last time. Barack Obama carried her downstate Illinois district twice, but Trump won it by 0.7 percentage points. She does not think he will carry it again this time, and her seat is considered safe. \u201cI always talk to members or candidates about running your office or running your campaign like you're the mayor of the district, and what I mean by that is there's no issue too small,\u201d she said. \u201cThey all get that.\u201dCoronavirus falloutSenate Republicans will propose cutting weekly emergency unemployment benefits from $600 to $200.\u201cSenate Republicans want to reduce the $600 payment to $200 until states can implement a new approach that would pay workers 70 percent of the income they collected before they lost their jobs. The states are supposed to phase in the new formula within two months,\u201d Erica Werner, Jeff Stein and Seung Min Kim report. \u201cThe legislation is expected to include a new round of $1,200 checks to individual Americans, an extension of unemployment benefits at a reduced level, billions of dollars for schools with some of the money aimed at helping classrooms reopen, and a five-year liability shield for businesses, health care providers and others. The legislation also includes at least $100 billion more for the small-business Paycheck Protection Program and is expected to extend a limited moratorium on evictions. It does not contain any new money for state and local governments \u2013 a key Democratic demand \u2013 but instead gives state and local leaders additional flexibility in spending the $150 billion approved in the Cares Act in March.\u201dTrump\u2019s national security adviser tested positive.Robert C. O\u2019Brien is the highest-ranking Trump administration official known to have tested positive for the virus. \u201cHe has mild symptoms and has been self-isolating and working from a secure location off site,\u201d the White House said in a statement this morning. \u201cThere is no risk of exposure to the President or the Vice President. The work of the National Security Council continues uninterrupted.\u201d (John Wagner)Trump started to get more involved when he was told his supporters were suffering.\u201cPeople close to Trump, many speaking anonymously to share candid discussions and impressions, say the president\u2019s inability to wholly address the crisis is due to his almost pathological unwillingness to admit error; a positive feedback loop of overly rosy assessments and data from advisers and Fox News; and a penchant for magical thinking that prevented him from fully engaging with the pandemic,\u201d Ashley Parker and Phil Rucker report. \u201cIn the past couple of weeks, senior advisers began presenting Trump with maps and data showing spikes in coronavirus cases among \u2018our people\u2019 in Republican states, a senior administration official said. They also shared projections predicting that virus surges could soon hit politically important states in the Midwest \u2014 including Michigan, Minnesota and Wisconsin, the official said. This new approach seemed to resonate, as he hewed closely to pre-scripted remarks in a trio of coronavirus briefings last week. \u2026ADAD\u201cSome close to the president say that when Trump claims, as he did twice last week, that the virus will simply \u2018disappear,\u2019 there is a part of him that actually believes that assessment, making him more reluctant to take the practical steps required to combat the pandemic. \u2026 Trump also maintained such a sense of grievance \u2014 about how the virus was personally impacting him, his presidency and his reelection prospects \u2014 that aides recount spending valuable time listening to his gripes, rather than focusing on crafting a national strategy to combat the pandemic.\u201dChief correspondent Dan Balz: \u201cAmerica\u2019s global standing is at a low point. The pandemic made it worse. Under Trump, the United States retreats from collaborative leadership at a time of global crisis.\u201dEditorial page editor Fred Hiatt: \u201cIn just one month, Trump commits a whole new set of potentially impeachable offenses.\u201dSeven-day averages for new cases hit fresh highs in more than a dozen states.\u201cThe United States tallied just shy of 1,000 coronavirus-related daily deaths on Saturday after a four-day streak of four-digit death tolls, the worst accounting of human loss from the virus since late May,\u201d Meryl Kornfield and Marisa Iati report. \u201cThe country reported 59,737 new infections and 566 additional deaths as of Sunday evening, resulting in a seven-day average of infections that was slightly lower than Saturday\u2019s and an average of deaths that was a little bit higher. The world surpassed 16 million confirmed cases over the weekend and reached at least 641,000 coronavirus-related deaths. The United States accounts for about one-fourth of the reported infections and one-fifth of the death toll.\u201cAs of Sunday evening, the seven-day averages for new cases hit fresh highs in several states, including Alaska, Colorado, Hawaii, Louisiana, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Wisconsin and Wyoming. Nevada, Texas and South Carolina set records for their seven-day averages of daily deaths, and Mississippi and North Carolina tied their previous highs. \u2026 Florida\u2019s average number of deaths rose for the third straight day.

(Ozarks Independent)Coronavirus vaccine researchers face a challenge convincing blacks and Hispanics to join trials.\"A vaccine must work for everyone \u2014 young and old; black, brown and white. To prove that it does, many of the 30,000 volunteers for each trial must come from diverse communities. It\u2019s a scientific necessity, but also a moral imperative, as younger people of color die of coronavirus at twice the rate of white people, and black, Hispanic and Native Americans are hospitalized at four to five times the rate of white people in the same age groups. \u2018If this is a vaccine trial that enrolls a bunch of 20-somethings or white college graduates, it will not give us the information we need,\u2019 Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, said in an interview,\u201d Carolyn Johnson reports.\u00a0\u201cUnethical research abuses of black and brown communities, including the Tuskegee experiments that withheld syphilis treatments from African Americans and Guatemalan experiments that deliberately infected prisoners with sexually transmitted diseases, have become cultural touchstones for many people of color, sowing deep distrust of medical authorities. That mistrust \u2014 coupled with unequal access to health care, information barriers and racial bias \u2014 means they are underrepresented in research trials. \u2026 In normal times, it can take years of planning to create trials with representation from minority communities, a job that often comes down to human interaction and time. That task is all the more complicated now, with face-to-face interactions limited by the pandemic, community gatherings presenting a risk for virus spread and a rush to recruit.

Violators have been killed.\u201cArmed groups in this violence-fraught nation of 50 million are imposing new levels of control during the coronavirus outbreak, and enforcing some of the strictest lockdown measures in the world \u2014 with harsh penalties for violators. In the port city of Tumaco, a narco-trafficking hub in the Colombian southwest, guerrillas posted pamphlets declaring all curfew violators \u2018military targets.\u2019 In a warning to all, a medical transport responding to a call after curfew was torched in early May, its driver and patient killed,\u201d Megan Janetsky and Anthony Faiola report.\u00a0\u201cHuman rights groups, community leaders and government officials say a toxic slate of leftist guerrillas, right-wing paramilitaries and drug cartels are using the outbreak to consolidate control over parts of a country still reeling from the aftermath of five decades of armed conflict. The increasingly violent competition shows the power of the pandemic to deepen preexisting societal challenges and loosen the grip of government in fragile states.\"Sadly, this is a global trend: \u201cThe Taliban in Afghanistan, Comando Vermehlo in Rio and MS-13 in El Salvador, among others, have imposed their own curfews and, in some instances, distributed food, masks and disinfectant in areas they control. But the Colombian groups have distinguished themselves in the level of violence they\u2019re applying to enforcement.

On the other side, the words of \u2018We Shall Overcome\u2019 could be heard as family, hundreds of onlookers and several troopers greeted Lewis. A military honor guard moved the casket from the caisson to a hearse for the trip to Montgomery, where he will lie in state. \u2026\u201cThe ceremony came on the second of six days of tributes to the son of sharecroppers, fighter for civil rights and lawmaker widely hailed as the conscience of Congress.

The letter demands a briefing for all members of Congress. on the threats. \u00a0It was signed by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.), House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) and Sen. Mark Warner (Va.), top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee.The muscular statements just four months before Election Day draw a marked contrast with President Trump who has been largely silent about the threat of election interference. Instead, Trump\u2019s main election security concern has been states\u2019 efforts to increase mail voting during the coronavirus pandemic, which he baselessly claims will lead to widespread fraud.\u00a0Trump declined to say he\u2019d accept November\u2019s election results during a Fox News interview, alleging without evidence mail voting could \u201crig\u201d the outcome.The congressional Democrats\u2019 letter may have been aimed at a GOP investigation into Biden.\u00a0That probe, led by Senate Homeland Security Committee Chairman Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) and Judiciary Chairman Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), explores whether Biden\u2019s son Hunter\u2019s former role on the board of the Ukrainian energy company Burisma unduly influenced Obama administration policy.

Trump at the time seemed to embrace a conspiracy theory positing that Ukraine was responsible for the hacking campaign that undermined the 2016 contest rather than Russia as U.S. intelligence agencies and the Mueller report have confirmed.\u00a0Fiona Hill, a former member of Trump's National Security Council, warned Republicans at the time that claims Ukraine was involved in election interference could play into the hands of Russian President Vladimir Putin.The Democratic efforts come as time is running short to deliver a surge of election funding to states.\u00a0They say that money is necessary to protect states against foreign hacking and to ensure voters can safely cast ballots during the pandemic. But they\u2019ve faced stiff opposition from Republicans, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.).ADADThe last chance to secure the funding may be in the next coronavirus stimulus bill Congress is now crafting.\u00a0The House passed a bill more than two months ago to deliver $3.6 billion to help states ramp up voting by mail and other changes to make voting safer and more secure during the pandemic.

But people who use the technology in Android devices must turn on their location data for it to work.\u00a0ADADGovernments that have built apps using the technology worry that means Google can actually track users\u2019 locations despite claims the company would respect users\u2019 privacy,\u00a0Natasha Singer at the New York Times reports. The apps, which are being built by government health services, alert people when they've come into contact in the last 30 days with someone who reports testing positive for coronavirus.

Subscribe today.arrow-rightAs the Trump administration and Senate Republicans clash on the composition, price tag and timing of their plan, deadlines are fast approaching for several other programs that need funding to help prop up the pandemic-ravaged economy.A federal moratorium on evictions protecting about 12 million renters expires Friday. A program to help state and local governments is dwindling, leaving them to face laying off employees and contractors. And small businesses struggling to stay afloat have only until Aug. 8 to apply for forgivable loans through the Paycheck Protection Program.ADADLike most of the rest of the emergency spending package, there is little easy agreement emerging on these items among Republicans, much less between the GOP and Democrats. And the prospect of reaching consensus fast enough to pass a bill by the end of next week was remote enough Tuesday that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) laughed as he dismissed it to reporters, according to Erica Werner, Jeff Stein and Seung Min Kim.\u00a0The approaching fiscal cliffs \u201care all so significant,\u201d S&P Global chief U.S. economist Beth Ann Bovino tells me. Among other concerns, amid a sputtering economic rebound, another downturn could force more businesses to shut their doors, and \u201cthe impact on the on the economy is not necessarily going to be \u2018one and one equals two.\u2019 There could very well be a nonlinear impact this time around.\u201dLeading economists say after extending unemployment benefits, funding for state and local governments presents the most urgent need.In a survey of 33 top economists by FiveThirtyEight and the Initiative on Global Markets at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, 85 percent said the aid should be a top-three priority for policymakers crafting the relief package. And 36 percent said it should be the top priority. Via FiveThirtyEight:\u00a0Yet the proposal Senate Republicans are forging isn\u2019t set to include new relief for state and local governments. Instead, the lawmakers appear likely to give governors and local officials more flexibility in directing the $150 billion that has already been allocated.ADADState and local leaders say it's not nearly enough and are pushing Congress for $500 to $1 trillion in new help. House Democrats included $1 trillion for them in the relief package they passed in May. And Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.) has coauthored a bipartisan proposal to send $500 billion in new support to state and local governments. But many of his colleagues object, in part over concerns about the price tag.Governments beyond the Beltway are getting squeezed from two directions: The economic freeze has choked off tax revenue, just as they face higher costs to support those dislocated by the downturn and respond to the public health crisis itself. Unlike the federal government, nearly all are required to balance their budgets, meaning funding shortfalls will force spending cuts. And those could have a macroeconomic effect, considering the contribution local governments make to overall economic activity.\u201cCollectively, state and local governments outspend Washington on direct goods and services, employ more workers than the domestic manufacturing sector, and are responsible for about 11 percent of national GDP,\u201d Anshu Siripurapu and Jonathan Masters of the Council on Foreign Relations recently wrote.Housing advocates are raising alarms about the sunset of an eviction ban.\u201cThe moratorium covers renters who live in homes with federally backed mortgages, which the Urban Institute\u00a0estimates\u00a0to be 12.3 million households, or about 30 percent of all renters nationwide,\u201d Renae Merle reports. \u201cOnce the moratorium lapses, landlords can give their delinquent tenants 30 days\u2019 notice and then begin filing eviction paperwork in late August.\u201dSome 96 percent of renters made their June payments, roughly matching the same month last year, according to the National Multifamily House Council.ADADBut housing advocates worry that number could plummet if the weekly $600 payments in federal unemployment benefits dry up, delivering a gut-punch to millions of lower-income people who have lost their jobs. \u201cWe are looking at an eviction cliff, and once we fall over it, it will be hard to climb back,\u201d National Housing Conference president David Dworkin tells Renae.Providing more funding for the PPP presents a rare point of agreement.McConnell and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin both support extending the lending program for small businesses. McConnell wants to tweak its terms to \u201cmore closely target troubled businesses,\u201d the Wall Street Journal\u2019s Andrew Duehren reports. \u201cSen. Marco Rubio (R., Fla.), who leads the Senate Small Business Committee, said that effort will involve both repurposing leftover PPP funds and likely appropriating additional ones.\u201dADADBut little is fixed as Republicans spent Tuesday sparring over the proposal\u2019s basics. \u201cThe Republican and White House positions changed multiple times as the day went on,\u201d Erica, Jeff and Seung Min report.\u201cComplicating matters, other Republican lawmakers appeared mortified about the growing size of the spending bill, leading to bickering over which policies to remove and warning that miscalculations could allow Democrats to seize control of the White House and the Senate in November,\u201d they write.\u00a0\u201cThe whole process now appears likely to spill into August, something the White House and congressional Democrats had hoped to avoid, because it would mean more than 20 million Americans would lose emergency unemployment benefits when they expire at the end of this month. They have not mapped out a plan for what would happen to these people as the pandemic\u2019s turmoil continues to weigh on the U.S. economy.\u201dMarket moversDow pulls out 150-point gain.But tech stocks drag down Nasdaq: \u201cThe Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 closed higher on Tuesday as traders booked profits from the major tech names and added to positions in the more beaten-down value stocks,\u201d CNBC's Fred Imbert and Yun Li report.ADAD\u201cThe 30-stock Dow gained 159.53 points, or 0.6 percent, to close at 26,840.40.

But the virus\u2019 resurgence in much of the country could impede further gains. Last month\u2019s rise in consumer spending followed a seasonally adjusted 8.5% surge in May after spending had plunged the previous two months when the pandemic shuttered businesses, caused tens of millions of layoffs and sent the economy into a recession.___Trump, GOP soften on opposition to $600 jobless benefitADWASHINGTON \u2014 The White House and its GOP allies appear to be retreating from their opposition to a $600-per- week supplemental unemployment benefit that has propped up both the economy and family budgets but is expiring Friday. The idea is a prominent feature of top-level Washington talks that are set to continue Saturday on a major election-season COVID-19 response measure. The two sides took their case to the media Friday. White House chief of staff Mark Meadows accused Democrats of refusing to negotiate, while House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said a short-term extension only makes sense if agreement is near on the larger relief bill.AD___Tech giants lead gains as S&P 500 closes 4th winning monthADNEW YORK \u2014 Big Tech continues to steamroll through the pandemic, and strong gains for some of the market\u2019s most influential companies on Friday helped Wall Street close out its fourth straight winning month. The S&P 500 rose 0.8% following blowout profit reports from Apple and several other tech titans. The gains didn\u2019t come easily, though, and the stock market flipped up and down through the day amid worries about the economy and whether Congress can find agreement on more aid for it. Other markets continued to show caution, with the 10-year Treasury yield touching its lowest level since March and gold rising again.___Plug it in: Electric car charging station numbers are risingADDETROIT \u2014 As automakers introduce more models powered by electricity, there may not be enough public charging stations to handle the load.

Companies are struggling to raise the numbers now because they\u2019re investing before demand arrives. But the number of stations is rising.

It was the largest drop on record. Spain, which suffered a severe virus outbreak that devastated its tourism industry, was the hardest hit with a drop of 18.5%. Italy and Portugal were also hard hit but no country escaped. The decline in Europe compares with a 9.5% quarter on quarter decline for the United States. The outlook is for a long and uncertain climb back to pre-virus levels that could take until 2022 or longer.___3 charged in massive Twitter hack, Bitcoin scamADMIAMI \u2014 A British man, a Florida man and a Florida teen have been identified by authorities as the hackers who earlier this month took over Twitter accounts of prominent politicians, celebrities and technology moguls to scam people around globe out of more than $100,000 in Bitcoin. The 17-year-old boy was arrested Friday in Tampa. The adults face federal charges in California. The arrests came after hackers sent bogus tweets on July 15 from the accounts of Barack Obama, Joe Biden, Mike Bloomberg and a number of tech billionaires including Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates and Tesla CEO Elon Musk. The tweets offered to send $2,000 for every $1,000 sent to an anonymous Bitcoin address.AD___Trump says US \u2018may be banning\u2019 China-owned video app TikTokADNEW YORK \u2014 President Donald Trump says his administration is weighing action against TikTok, a popular Chinese-owned video app that has been a source of national-security and censorship concerns. Trump\u2019s comments came after published reports that the administration is planning to order China\u2019s ByteDance to sell TikTok. There were also reports Friday that software giant Microsoft is in talks to buy the app. TikTok said it does not comment on rumors or speculation. TikTok has said it has tens of millions of U.S. users and hundreds of millions globally. But its Chinese ownership has raised concerns about censorship of videos and the potential for sharing user data with Chinese officials.___The S&P 500 rose 24.90 points, or 0.8%, to 3,271.12.

Subscribe today.arrow-rightThe Democrats did not detail exactly what they want the administration to say. But the call comes as the nation\u2019s intelligence agencies, congressional intelligence committees and Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden have all warned of renewed interference this year. Trump himself has been loath to discuss the subject or acknowledge that Russia tried to sow discord in the 2016 contest by hacking Democratic accounts and pushing out inflammatory content on social media.The Democrats\u2019 letter Friday was in response to a statement earlier in the day by William Evanina, the government\u2019s chief counterintelligence official. The statement said adversaries such as China, Russia and Iran are seeking to compromise U.S. private communications and infrastructure in campaigns. It also warned of disinformation being pushed out on social media.ADADWithout giving specifics, the Democrats said Evanina\u2019s statement \u201cdoes not go nearly far enough in arming the American people with the knowledge they need about how foreign powers are seeking to influence our political process\u201d and falsely paints the three countries as equivalent in their efforts. The statement was from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., and Virginia Sen. Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence panel.\u201cWe can trust the American people with knowing what to do with the information they receive and making those decisions for themselves,\u201d the Democrats said. \u201cBut they cannot do so if they are kept in the dark about what our adversaries are doing, and how they are doing it. When it comes to American elections, Americans must decide.\u201dThe Democrats specifically criticized the line in Evanina\u2019s statement that said Russia has a persistent objective to weaken the U.S. and \u201cdenigrate what it sees as an anti-Russia \u2018establishment\u2019 in America.\u201d They said that line \u201comits much on a subject of immense importance\u201d and is \u201cso generic as to be almost meaningless.\u201dADADIn his statement, Evanina said it would be \u201cextraordinarily difficult\u201d for the adversaries to broadly disrupt the fall election or change vote tallies, but that \u201cwe continue to monitor malicious cyber actors trying to gain access to U.S. state and federal networks, including those responsible for managing elections.\u201dSpecifically, Evanina said, China is \u201cexpanding its influence efforts to shape the policy environment in the United States, pressure political figures it views as opposed to China\u2019s interests, and counter criticism of China.\u201d Iran is also spreading disinformation to undermine U.S. institutions, he said.It is unclear what information the Democrats want to be made public. On Monday, the same four Democrats wrote in a letter to FBI Director Christopher Wray that they are concerned that Congress appears to be the target of a \u201cconcerted foreign interference campaign\u201d to influence the 2020 presidential election. They asked Wray for an all-members, classified briefing on the matter before the August recess.ADADDemocrats, including members of the Senate intelligence panel, have voiced concerns that an ongoing Republican probe into Biden\u2019s son, Hunter Biden, and his work in Ukraine would amplify Russian disinformation. But they did not specifically mention the investigation,which is being led by Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Chairman Ron Johnson, R-Wis.The warnings from all sides come after bipartisan criticism of the way President Barack Obama\u2019s administration handled the 2016 interference as it was happening. A bipartisan congressional report released by the Senate intelligence committee earlier this year said the Obama administration was ill-prepared to handle and failed to respond effectively as officials feared getting caught up in a heavily politicized environment and undermining the election.Copyright 2020 The Associated Press.

A guide to the rumors and the real privacy risks.The report details how China has sought to \u201ccreate a new model of governance for the digital domain,\u201d through mass surveillance technology and controlling access to information and content. American social media platforms like Google, Twitter and Facebook are banned inside China.ADThe report also details how China has invested in technology that aids authoritarianism, such as facial recognition software and other surveillance technology. This technology is now being exported to countries around the world, such as Venezuela, Uzbekistan, Zimbabwe and others.ADThe report focuses also on how digital surveillance is expanding to include the collection of DNA samples, fingerprints, voice samples and blood types \u2014 in particular from those in the western Xinjiang region, where the Chinese Communist Party has embarked on a campaign to strip the minority of their language, culture and religion.This week, the U.S. Commerce Department added 11 companies to a trade blacklist over alleged violations in Xinjiang, bringing the number of Chinese companies on the list to just under 50. In a statement following the sanctions, Wilbur Ross, the secretary of commerce, said, \u201cBeijing actively promotes the reprehensible practice of forced labor and abusive DNA collection and analysis schemes to repress its citizens.\u201dAD\u201cThis action will ensure that our goods and technologies are not used in the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s despicable offensive against defenseless Muslim minority populations,\u201d Ross added.ADHuman rights advocates studying China\u2019s use of digital technologies to control its citizens have long argued that Western and other governments need to act against the Chinese government and  its actions. The coronavirus pandemic has also led to a huge amount of data collection in China as a response to the public health crisis, and surveillance technology has also been used to identify critics of the government\u2019s response.Most recently, Beijing passed new national security laws in Hong Kong, which could potentially see the extension of the Chinese surveillance state into one of the freest Internet landscapes in the world. Google, Twitter, Facebook and others \u2014 that under the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d framework could operate freely in Hong Kong and in some cases have employees there \u2014 have now paused their data requests from Hong Kong authorities. Some American tech companies there have now shelved plans for future investment, and others are contemplating pulling employees out.AD\u201cWhat the Chinese government is trying to achieve is unprecedented in human history,\u201d said Maya Wang, China senior researcher at Human Rights Watch. \u201cNo other government has had such an intrusive knowledge of such a large number of people over such a wide swath of land anywhere at any time in history \u2014 and they are wielding that power of data.\u201dADWang argues that while it is legitimate for other governments to be \u201cvery, very worried about the Chinese government and the pursuit of this kind of digital totalitarianism,\u201d the U.S. approach has been insufficient and amounts to a \u201cwhack-a-mole\u201d approach with companies like Huawei and TikTok. Some policies of the Trump administration, she added, appear to be rooted in an anti-China approach, rather than a holistic approach on how to deal with the privacy and security of its citizens.Menendez\u2019s report argues that the Trump administration has failed to adequately respond to the threat posed by China\u2019s approach to cyberspace, and that the U.S. government needs to rally the international community around the common goal of offering an alternative to the Chinese digital model.ADAmong the recommendations is that the United States should aggressively develop alternatives to Chinese 5G technology along with its allies, using federal funds, and create an industry consortium on 5G. The report also recommends that the United States should establish a fund to support organizations worldwide like NGOs and think tanks that are fighting to counter surveillance regimes.AD\u201cThere has been a sharp increase in bipartisan interest for Congress to recalibrate our nation\u2019s entire China policy,\u201d he said.\u201cAs more of my colleagues recognize the scope of the challenge that China presents to the United States and to the entire international order, it is my hope that this report will not only strengthen their sense of urgency to act but also inform the legislative process,\u201d he added.\n\n\u2018Police cloud\u2019: Chinese database tracks apps, car location and even electricity usage in Muslim regionMasks, cash and apps: How Hong Kong\u2019s protesters find ways to outwit the surveillance statePompeo says the U.S. is \u2018certainly looking at\u2019 banning TikTok and other Chinese apps", "comment": "0 Comments", "topic": "Asia & Pacific"}, {"cover": "", "title": "Asia Today: Australian outbreak attributed to sick workers", "date": "Jul 26, 2020", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/asia-today-australian-outbreak-attributed-to-sick-workers/2020/07/26/d286cba0-cfab-11ea-826b-cc394d824e35_story.html", "keyword": "China and Security", "website": "the Washington Post", "author": "", "content": "MELBOURNE, Australia \u2014 Australia\u2019s hard-hit Victoria state on Monday posted a new daily record of 532 new COVID-19 cases, and the government leader warned that a lockdown in the city of Melbourne will continue if infected people continue to go to work instead of staying home.Support our journalism.

There were more than 600 cases of COVID-19 cases among residents and staff at Melbourne aged care homes, Kidd said.ADIn other developments in the Asia-Pacific region:\u2014 As India recorded nearly 50,000 new cases of the coronavirus, Prime Minister Narendra Modi prepared to ramp up testing capacity in three major cities. The 49,931 cases reported on Monday brought India\u2019s nationwide tally to beyond 1.4 million. India has the world\u2019s third-highest confirmed caseload after the United States and Brazil. The 32,771 reported deaths from the disease in India, however, represent a far lower fatality rate than in the other two countries, in part because of limited testing. Modi\u2019s office says new high-volume test facilities in Noida, a suburb of New Delhi, and Mumbai and Kolkata, each capable of as many as 10,000 tests per day, will help authorities track the virus. India\u2019s chief medical research agency says the country tested about 515,000 samples for COVID-19 on Sunday.AD\u2014 Hong Kong will ban dining in at restaurants completely and make it mandatory to wear masks in all public places, as the city battles a worsening coronavirus outbreak that has infected over 1,000 people in the last two weeks. The tightened measures will be effective for at least one week starting Wednesday. They are an extension of a previous ban on eating at restaurants after 6 p.m., as well as a mandatory wearing of masks on public transport. A ban on public gatherings of more than four people has also been tightened, with gatherings limited to two people.AD\u2014 Vietnam has postponed its hosting of Asia\u2019s largest security forum, which includes North Korea, and an annual meeting of Southeast Asian foreign ministers by a month to September due to the pandemic. Two Southeast Asian diplomats said Monday that Vietnam, which leads the Association of Southeast Asian Nations this year, hopes to hold face-to-face meetings in mid-September instead of over video if the annual gatherings were to be held as originally scheduled later this week. The 10-nation bloc hosts the ASEAN Regional Forum, which brings together its top diplomats with counterparts from the United States, China, Japan, Russia, India, the two Koreas and other Asia Pacific countries to discuss the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and other security issues. Most of about 1,300 ASEAN meetings this year have shifted online due to the pandemic.\u2014 About 80,000 people, mostly local tourists, are being evacuated from the popular Vietnamese beach city of Da Nang after more than a dozen people there were confirmed to have COVID-19, the government said Monday. Vietnam reimposed a social distancing order in Da Nang on Sunday following the confirmation of four initial cases, the first known to be locally transmitted in the country in over three months. The Civil Aviation Administration said the country\u2019s four airlines have added extra flights and larger planes to transport the people out of the city in central Vietnam. \u201cIt will probably take four days to evacuate the 80,000 passengers,\u201d CAA director Dinh Viet Thang said in a statement. Those leaving Da Nang have been told to self-quarantine and report their health condition to local health agencies, the Ministry of Health said.AD\u2014 New Zealand health authorities say they will trace and test people who came into contact with a traveler from the country who tested positive for the coronavirus after arriving in South Korea last week. Health Minister Chris Hipkins says they\u2019ve also asked South Korean authorities to undertake a second test to make sure the passenger has the virus. It has been nearly three months since the last case of community transmission was found in New Zealand and any proof the passenger caught the virus while in New Zealand would come as a big shock to the nation of 5 million people. Health officials in New Zealand say their counterparts in South Korea suspect the traveler was infected while in transit in Singapore. \u201cWe have got our contact tracing system kicking into gear though,\u201d Hipkins said.AD\u2014 China on Monday reported 61 new cases of coronavirus, spread between its northeastern and northwestern regions. The Xinjiang region in the northwest reported 41 new cases, while Liaoning and Jilin provinces in the northeast saw a combined 16. Another four cases were brought by Chinese travelers from outside the country. China has reported 4,634 deaths among 83,891 cases of COVID-19.\u2014 South Korea reported 25 new cases, bringing its national caseload to 14,175 infections and 299 deaths. South Korea\u2019s Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said 16 of the new cases were tied to people arriving from abroad. The country in past days have reported dozens of cases among crew members of a Russia-flagged cargo ship docked in Busan and hundreds of South Korean construction workers airlifted from virus-ravaged Iraq. Eight of the nine local transmissions were from the Seoul metropolitan area.Copyright 2020 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Among adults supporting Biden, 77 percent say they are certain to vote, up from 67 percent in May.Democrat Hillary Clinton won the national popular vote four years ago but lost in the electoral college because of narrow defeats across the industrial Midwestern states of Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania. Operatives involved in the contest agree the race is tighter in these battlegrounds than nationally.ADADThough Biden finds himself in an undeniably enviable position for a challenger, Clinton also led Trump in every national poll four summers ago. Democratic nominees John Kerry and Michael Dukakis both led in polls conducted during the summers of 2004 and 1988, respectively, only to lose in the fall.Moreover, the advantages of incumbency are significant. It has been 28 years since a president lost his bid for a second term.The country remains deeply polarized. The political environment has proven volatile. What will happen 100-plus days from now is unpredictable. What if a Supreme Court vacancy unexpectedly opens? What if Biden flubs in the debates? What if he picks a running mate who struggles to withstand the spotlight of national scrutiny?ADOur poll finds a lot of interest in the election: 86 percent of registered voters say they are certain to vote in November, higher at this point in any of the past three elections.ADBut the novel coronavirus injects layers of uncertainty related to forecasting turnout, with open questions about how millions will cast their ballots and whether mail-in voting might deter some people from participating. The poll finds that 59 percent of Americans say they prefer to vote in person, compared to 38 percent who say they would rather vote by mail.\u00a0\u201cTrump has repeatedly attacked voting by mail as subject to fraud, and the new survey shows that slightly more Americans say they think mail-in voting is vulnerable to significant levels of fraud, with 49 percent agreeing with that statement compared with 43 percent who say there are adequate protections to prevent significant fraud,\u201d Dan Balz and Scott Clement report. \u201cBut those percentages are driven by Trump\u2019s own party, with 73 percent of Republicans saying mail-in voting is subject to significant levels of fraud and 66 percent of Democrats saying there are adequate levels of protection against such problems.\u201dADThere are two other caution flags for Biden, who failed in his first two bids for the presidency. Despite the myriad of deeply reported blunders in the president\u2019s response to the cascade of crises enveloping the country, Trump and Biden are tied at 45 percent when respondents were asked who they think is the stronger leader.ADTrump still retains a narrow advantage on the economy, with 47 percent saying they trust him more and 45 percent saying they trust Biden more. That is down from an eight-point edge in March.Notably, Biden has a 20-point lead on who is more trusted to deal with the coronavirus, a 25-point advantage on race relations and a nine-point advantage on crime and public safety.Perhaps the best dynamic for Biden right now, though, is that voters across the ideological spectrum see this year\u2019s election mainly as a referendum on Trump\u2019s performance in office, whether they love or hate him. The president\u2019s overall job approval rating has dropped to 39 percent, with 57 percent disapproving \u2013 and 48 percent of Americans strongly disapproving.The Biden campaign plans to step up outreach to disillusioned Republicans. The Associated Press reports that former Ohio governor John Kasich, a candidate for the GOP presidential nomination in 2016, is expected to speak at the Democratic National Convention on Biden\u2019s behalf next month.ADADTrump has struggled to define his challenger, prompting him to change up his messaging and even his campaign team in recent weeks. Last Wednesday, he demoted campaign manager Brad Parscale to a digital-focused role and put Bill Stepien in charge. Trump has largely shifted from trying to cast the former vice president as \u201cSleepy Joe,\u201d with declining mental capacity, to portraying him as a far-left agent of chaos and destruction. White House senior adviser Stephen Miller has circulated dozens of bullet-pointed attacks on Biden that are at odds with reality and deeply ingrained public perceptions of Biden.\u00a0\u201cThe author of many of Trump\u2019s most pugilistic public statements, Miller has raised concerns to other White House aides that the campaign\u2019s messaging has not been tough enough on Biden \u2026 and a cadre of White House officials have begun working on campaign issues through their private email accounts and text message chains\u201d Michael Scherer and Josh Dawsey report. \u201cIn the talking points he distributed, Biden\u2019s elevation to the White House was described as an event that would \u2018surrender America and its citizens to the violent left-wing mob,\u2019 \u2018import terrorists,\u2019 and \u2018allow left-wing fascists to destroy America.\u2019 \u2026 (Biden launched his campaign with a video quoting the Declaration of Independence and has condemned the removal of statues that do not commemorate the Confederacy.)\u201dIn a pre-taped interview for \u201cFox News Sunday,\u201d Trump claimed that Biden wants to defund the police. In fact, the Democratic candidate has said he disagrees with that idea and even proposed increasing funding to departments that meet certain standards. Trump promised to produce proof for his assertion, which the campaign also levels in attack ads. \u201cThe White House has never sent us evidence,\u201d anchor Chris Wallace said as he aired the interview, \u201cbecause there is none.\u201d\u00a0I\u2019m back from vacation.I had a lovely time hiking, biking, kayaking, sailing and reading in Acadia National Park.

Confronted by Wallace with a chart showing that the number of coronavirus cases last week more than doubled from the spring peak in April, Trump replied: \u2018If we didn\u2019t test, you wouldn\u2019t be able to show that chart. If we tested half as much, those numbers would be down.\u2019 By the president\u2019s logic, that assumes people contract the virus only if they test positive, ignoring the fact that many people are asymptomatic carriers and unknowingly spread the contagion without taking a test or being reported. Wallace later explained to Trump that the number of tests has increased by 37 percent but the number of cases has shot up by 194 percent. \u2026\u00a0\u201cTrump and his aides recently have sought to divert attention from the soaring number of coronavirus cases by focusing on the rate of deaths. In the Fox interview, Trump falsely asserted, \u2018I think we have one of the lowest mortality rates in the world.\u2019 \u2018It\u2019s not true, sir,\u2019 Wallace replied. \u2018We had 900 deaths on a single day just this week.\u2019 Trump shouted to aides hovering nearby: \u2018Can you please get the mortality rates?\u2019 White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany quickly presented Trump with data she said was from Deborah Birx, a physician and the White House coronavirus response coordinator, backing up his claim. \u2018Number one low mortality fatality rates,\u2019 Trump claimed. At that point, Fox interrupted the taped interview for Wallace to explain to his viewers that according to data from Johns Hopkins University, the United States ranked seventh among 20 countries in mortality rate, worse than Brazil and Russia. \u2026\u00a0\u201cThe president called Anthony S. Fauci, the nation\u2019s top infectious-disease expert, \u2018a little bit of an alarmist.\u2019 \u2026 Trump also challenged the assessment of Robert Redfield, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, who again warned last week that the pandemic could worsen this fall when flu season begins, reflecting widespread scientific consensus. \u2018I don\u2019t think he knows,\u2019 Trump said of Redfield.\" Trump reiterated that the virus will just disappear at some point. \u201cYou know why? Because I\u2019ve been right probably more than anybody else,\u201d he said.Quote of the day\u201cThe president got bored with it,\u201d said GOP strategist Dave Carney, a top adviser to Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R), about Trump and the contagion. (NYT)Endangered GOP senators are under pressure as the Senate considers a new relief package.\u201cAs the Senate returns this week for a three-week sprint before the August break, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) is facing competing demands from President Trump and Republican senators, including some who are up for reelection in states hit hard by the virus and are coming under withering attacks by Democratic challengers over the pandemic,\u201d Seung Min Kim, Rachael Bade and Erica Werner report. \u201cIn particular, the expiration of an additional $600-per-week in unemployment insurance by July 31 is adding pressure on vulnerable GOP senators as 20 million to 30 million people remain out of work. McConnell and many other Republicans adamantly oppose extending the enhanced benefit at its current level, saying it discourages some from returning to work because they make more money by staying home. \u2026\u00a0ADAD\u201c[Republican Sen. Cory] Gardner said his constituents are pressing him for more federal assistance and said he supports extending the enhanced unemployment benefit, although he is open to an amount less than the additional $600 per week. He said he is also open to Democrats\u2019 demands for more aid for states and localities \u2026 The first-term Republican senator, who is facing former Colorado governor John Hickenlooper (D) on Nov. 3, said he conveyed his request to McConnell in a call. \u2026 Another at-risk Republican senator, Susan Collins of Maine, told reporters in her state last week that she is seeking more state and local aid \u2026 and a fresh round of aid for small businesses and education funding to help schools reopen. \u2026\u201cMcConnell is expected to unveil a pandemic relief proposal as early as Tuesday with a target value of $1 trillion, although some Republicans speculate that the figure could be larger. Extra attention is likely to be paid to the demands of vulnerable Republican senators, GOP officials said. \u2026 Trump is insisting on a cut in payroll taxes, which fund Social Security, as part of the next package, although few Republicans are warm to the idea and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) has repeatedly expressed opposition. \u2026\"The prime red line for Senate leaders has been liability protections. McConnell has a plan that offers schools, charities, businesses and medical workers a legal shield from being held responsible in coronavirus-related lawsuits unless there was gross negligence or intentional misconduct, according to a draft viewed by The Washington Post. The proposal has been shared with White House officials, who are reviewing it.ADAD\u201cMeanwhile, the states that have had the most dramatic spike in cases include Arizona, Georgia and Texas, all of which have Senate races in varying levels of competitiveness and where Democratic opponents have made the pandemic a central theme in their campaigns. \u2026 In Arizona, where case numbers are surging dramatically, polls have shown GOP Sen. Martha McSally well behind Mark Kelly, her Democratic challenger. Kelly, a former astronaut, has begun targeting ads toward Native American communities in the state, arguing that the federal government is ignoring their needs in the pandemic. He is calling for extending the enhanced unemployment benefit; McSally has not taken a position on the issue, according to a spokeswoman.\u201dMcConnell\u2019s draft plan leaves out many priorities for Democrats. The Kentuckian and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) will meet with Trump today to discuss the package before it\u2019s unveiled. \u201cThe administration and Senate Republicans have been clashing on some issues \u2014 including whether to include billions of dollars for coronavirus testing, contact tracing and other health-care priorities the administration opposes \u2014 and they are trying to form a unified front before starting talks with Democrats,\u201d Erica and Jeff Stein report. \u201cThe House passed a wide-ranging $3 trillion bill in May called the Heroes Act that Democrats insist represents their unity position, but Trump threatened to veto it and McConnell ignored it.\u201dAmerica\u2019s mishandling of the pandemic has defied most experts\u2019 predictions.\u201cIsabelle Papadimitriou, 64, a respiratory therapist in Dallas, had been treating a surge of patients as the Texas economy reopened. She developed covid-19 symptoms June 27 and tested positive two days later. The disease was swift and brutal. She died the morning of the Fourth of July,\u201d Joel Achenbach, William Wan, Karin Brulliard and Chelsea Janes report.\u00a0\u201cThe holiday had always been her daughter\u2019s favorite. Fiana Tulip loved the family cookouts, the fireworks, the feeling of America united. Now, she wonders whether she\u2019ll ever be able to celebrate it again. In mourning, she\u2019s furious. Tulip, 40, had seen her country fail to control the novel coronavirus. \u2026 \u2018I feel like her death was a hundred percent preventable. I\u2019m angry at the Trump administration. I\u2019m angry with the state of our politics. I\u2019m angry at the people who even now refuse to wear masks,\u2019 she said. \u2026\u00a0ADAD\u201cIn October, not long before the novel coronavirus began sickening people in China, a comprehensive review ranked the pandemic preparedness of 195 countries. The project \u2026 assigned scores to countries as a way to warn them of the rising threat of infectious-disease outbreaks. With a score of 83.5 out of 100, the United States ranked No. 1. How did the nation get caught so flat-footed? By not really trying, said Beth Cameron, who helped lead the project for the Nuclear Threat Initiative. The federal government punted the coronavirus response to the states, counties and cities, said Cameron, who was senior director for global health security and biodefense on the White House National Security Council and helped write a pandemic response plan under President Barack Obama. The team Cameron led was disbanded after Donald Trump took office. \u2026\u00a0\u201cKristin Urquiza, 39, said she tried warning her father, Mark \u2014 a lifelong Republican \u2014 against going out and risking infection. In their home state of Arizona, as leaders including Gov. Doug Ducey (R) sprinted to reopen in May and June, Urquiza could tell she was losing the argument. \u2018When the president, the governor and people on cable news are all saying one thing, how do you compete with that?\u2019 she said. \u2018He would push back. \u2018I hear what you\u2019re saying, but why would the governor say it\u2019s safe to go out if it\u2019s not true?\u2019\u2019 Her father died of the virus June 30. In the obituary she wrote, she lashed out at government leaders. \u2018He was a huge supporter of Trump and [Ducey]. He believed what they said. And they betrayed him,\u2019 she said in an interview.\u201dArizona reported 147 coronavirus deaths on Sunday, a new daily record, and 2,742 new cases.

(Karla Adam)China is using forced labor from Uighur concentration camps to produce masks.\u201cUighurs are a largely Muslim ethnic minority primarily from the Xinjiang region of northwest China. The program sends Uighurs and other ethnic minorities into factory and service jobs. Now, their labor is part of the P.P.E. supply chain. According to China\u2019s National Medical Products Administration, only four companies in Xinjiang produced medical grade protective equipment before the pandemic. As of June 30, that number was 51.

But Chao has said she doesn\u2019t generally support the idea of writing new rules in response to the pandemic, saying they could prove difficult to undo once the crisis passes.Nonetheless, Chao has said she supports guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that passengers on public transportation should wear masks, a position her office reiterated Tuesday.

Willis wrote in his letter that every union he represents has had members fall ill and die.ADADIn the absence of a single set of rules from the federal government, airlines and airports have been setting their own standards for passengers and employees. In recent weeks, though, airlines have been toughening up their rules on masks and banning passengers who don\u2019t comply.Major transit agencies, too, require face coverings. In the Washington area, Metro officials told passengers to wear masks in May. New York requires masks on the subway and buses, as well as on ferries and in taxis.But enforcing rules has proved tricky. In Philadelphia, authorities had to dial back their policy after officers were shown on video dragging a man from a bus.ADIn the petition, Willis said the pandemic made it clear that the department had the power to issue a rule on an emergency basis, bypassing the need to take public comments, which might extend the process for months.ADA rule is needed, he wrote, because the federal government could help with enforcement and because guidelines and policies adopted by private companies have proved insufficient.\u201cNon-mandatory guidelines and a patchwork of mandates or additional guidelines from private companies, states, and other jurisdictions have failed to achieve the level of mask usage that is necessary,\u201d Willis wrote.Willis cited a case in China involving a person who began to feel ill during a bus ride but didn\u2019t put on a mask and infected five other passengers. In a second ride, the person did cover their face and no one else was infected.AD\u201cWhile anecdotal, this and a number of further epidemiological case studies point to the efficacy of wearing a mask to reduce transmission,\u201d he wrote.The battle over masks in a pandemic: An all-American storyThe Transportation Department\u2019s unwillingness to set hard rules has frustrated some Democratic lawmakers.ADAt a hearing in June, when Steve Dickson, the head of the Federal Aviation Administration, said new guidelines would be forthcoming, Sen.

The consulate closure is a major step that puts greater pressure on the already-tense relationship between the two countries.But this is not all about geopolitics \u2014 the escalating rift may also reflect election-year politics. Here\u2019s what you need to know.1. What just happened?The U.S. government has provided few details about why the Chinese consulate in Houston was directed to close.ADState Department spokesperson Morgan Ortagus said in a statement that \u201cThe United States will not tolerate the PRC\u2019s violations of our sovereignty and intimidation of our people, just as we have not tolerated the PRC\u2019s unfair trade practices, theft of American jobs, and other egregious behavior.\u201dADAssistant Secretary of State for East Asia and the Pacific David Stilwell described the Houston consulate as \u201cthe epicenter\u201d of China\u2019s military-backed industrial espionage efforts with \u201ca history of engaging in subversive behavior\u201d in the United States. Deputy Secretary of State Stephen Biegun cited China\u2019s \u201cabuse of the United States\u2019 academic freedom and welcoming posture toward international students\u201d as one reason the United States has \u201cwithdrawn our consent for the PRC to operate its consulate in Houston.\u201dBut the U.S. statements leave many questions unanswered, and do not suggest a coherent strategy to address real concerns about Chinese espionage and influence efforts. Late Wednesday, the New York Times reported on a seven-page document outlining investigations into activities at the Houston consulate. But if the consulate has been engaged in what the State Department calls \u201cmassive illegal spying and influence operations,\u201d why were these operations not detailed in a formal announcement by the Trump administration? Was the consulate previously warned to stop, and notified that this would be the punishment meted out if it did not desist?ADThe lack of clarity in the administration\u2019s messaging also makes it harder to assess what the consular closure is intended to accomplish. Is it aimed at stopping specific nefarious consular activities? Or is the messaging intentionally vague so the closure serves as general warning to Beijing? Consular closures do have precedent: The Trump administration ordered the Russian consulate in San Francisco to close in 2017, in part a reaction to Russia\u2019s call for the United States to downsize its diplomatic staff in Russia. The U.S. also closed the Russian consulate in Seattle in 2018, after the poisoning of a former Russian spy in the United Kingdom.ADBut in the absence of details, journalists and commentators have been left to speculate that the consulate\u2019s closure could be linked to everything from Chinese attempts to steal vaccine research or efforts to intimidate U.S. oil firms exploring in the South China Sea, fitting the Trump administration\u2019s consulate move into a larger narrative about spiraling U.S.-China tensions.How coronavirus changes the political outlook in China and the U.S.2. Don\u2019t forget about domestic politicsThere\u2019s another possibility: The Trump administration is using China as a boogeyman. As the pandemic set in, Republican campaign strategists determined that focusing on China \u2014 rather than the U.S. pandemic response \u2014 would help Trump and Republicans win in November.ADSpeeches by administration officials in recent weeks portray China as an existential threat to the United States \u2014 accompanied by policies to reduce ties and accelerate the process of \u201cdecoupling\u201d with China. Last week, the administration reportedly discussed a travel ban on all Communist Party members, and issued an executive order on Hong Kong that also announced the termination of the U.S. Fulbright exchange program to China.ADAnother possibility is that hawks within the administration are directing these moves, perhaps because they see a closing window of opportunity to accelerate the decoupling in U.S.-China relations before a prospective Biden \u201creset.\u201dEither way, the lack of careful messaging makes it seem like this onslaught may be the Trump administration\u2019s latest iteration of a get-tough on China play.3. But what are the costs?How will the Chinese government react to what Beijing has already called an unprecedented political provocation? So far, China has responded in kind to each of the Trump administration's actions. Many Chinese commentators expect the Chinese government to close a U.S. consulate in retaliation.The \u2018new Cold War\u2019 with China is way overblown. Here\u2019s why.In this case, at a time when U.S. journalists have already been kicked out of China due to tit-for-tat restrictions on the media, the United States has far less insight into China\u2019s authoritarian system than China does into the United States\u2019 democratic system. As a result, a tit-for-tat closure of consulates may hurt the United States\u2019 \u201ceyes and ears\u201d more than China\u2019s \u2014 and do little to address Chinese intellectual property theft.ADADWhat\u2019s lost in such closures? Research has shown the value of face-to-face diplomacy for gathering information, maintaining networks, sending credible signals and assessing the intentions of adversaries. Fewer on-the-ground contacts and channels reduce the ways China and the United States can communicate and defuse friction \u2014 or worse, a crisis.A more assertive Beijing raises new questions for U.S.-China relations4. What does this mean for U.S.-China relations?Shuttering consulates and burning documents amid accusations of espionage has a Cold War feel. But as Joshua Shifrinson wrote here at TMC last year, there are many reasons the United States and China are not destined for a \u201cnew Cold War\u201d \u2014 even if the Trump administration\u2019s actions appear to be moving the two countries in that direction. Among other reasons, the Chinese Communist Party maintains a nationalist fixation on achieving its security, regional dominance and a global order that is safe for autocracy, rather than embarking on an ideological crusade to remake other countries in its image.ADADAs David Edelstein wrote at TMC about rising U.S.-China tensions in 2018, \u201cIt is easier to appreciate the rising tension between Washington and Beijing than it is to identify what exactly they are competing over.\u201d This remains true even after two more years of \u201crising tensions.\u201dOne concern is that even if this is election-year politics \u2014 something China is familiar with when dealing with the United States \u2014 it may be difficult for the next U.S. administration to repair or reset relations, including salvaging the forms of engagement that still have value.In the midst of a pandemic, a major confrontation with China would appear far down the list of U.S. priorities.

We do not want this content on our platforms.\"Facebook posted revenue of $18.7 billion in second quarter ending June 30, an 11 percent increase over the same period a year ago \u2014 a solid showing despite advertisers pulling back due to the pandemic and a boycott of the social network that includes Disney, Verizon and more than a thousand other companies.ADADZuckerberg said people also \u201cwrongly assume\u201d that the company\u2019s business is dependent on a few large advertisers, but small businesses represent Facebook\u2019s largest advertisers. He said he was troubled by the calls to go after digital advertising, especially during a period of economic turmoil.\u201cIt\u2019s true that going after the ability to target ads would affect the revenue of companies like Facebook. But a much bigger cost would be that it would reduce the effectiveness of the ads and opportunities to grow,\u201d he said. \u201cThis would reduce the opportunities for small businesses so much that it would probably be felt at a macroeconomic level. Now is that really what policymakers want in the middle of a pandemic and recession?\u201dFacebook also paid out the $5 billion that it was required to pay to the Federal Trade Commission to settle charges that it violated consumer privacy when it allowed the political consultancy Cambridge Analytica to inappropriately siphon the data and profiles of millions of Facebook users, the company said.ADADOn Google\u2019s call, Pichai repeated familiar talking points that he believes Google is good for users and creates more choice. But he also admitted that the scrutiny wouldn\u2019t be going away anytime soon, and that the company would adapt if governments imposed new rules.\u201cWe\u2019ve obviously been operating under a scrutiny for a while and we realize at our scale that\u2019s appropriate, and we\u2019ve engaged constructively across jurisdictions,\u201d he said. \u201cObviously we will operate based on the rules. And so to the extent there are any areas we need to adapt, we will. Being flexible around those things are important, I think.\u201dGoogle faces investigations from the federal government and the states into its size, and has already been fined about $9 billion for antitrust concerns by the European Union.ADGoogle parent company Alphabet reported a slight 2 percent decrease in revenue to $38.3 billion, still beating Wall Street expectations. The company noted a \u201cgradual improvement\u201d in its ads business since the beginning of the pandemic. That began to pick up in the second quarter as more users started Googling for commercial items again after backing off in the early spring, Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat said on the earnings call. But she cautioned that the economy is far from recovered.AD\u201cWe do believe its premature to say that we\u2019re out of the woods,\u201d Porat said.Amazon also reported a change in consumer shopping habits since April. In the early days of the pandemic, customer demand was skyrocketing, mostly for specific products such as groceries and safety products. Its online grocery sales tripled this quarter year-over-year.AD\u201cThat mix is not super profitable,\u201d said Amazon Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky on a media call Tuesday. \u201cThe extra costs of covid essentially make that type of sale a break-even proposition for us.\u201dThe narrow demand was also likely due to Amazon\u2019s own policies. It began limiting shipments to \u201cessential\u201d products in March, a policy that has it eased up on in mid-April.That\u2019s around the time customers went back to more normal shopping patterns, and Olsavsky said the company was also able to ship more products. Customers also spent more money on digital entertainment products including e-books, Audible titles and movies.ADRevenue grew to $88.9 billion in revenue. And while the company spent more than $4 billion on various covid-19 measures, including additional safety measures for workers and scaling up to meet demand, it still posted a more than $5 billion profit.ADAmazon CEO Jeff Bezos received some of the toughest questions during Wednesday\u2019s hearing, partly because it was the executive\u2019s first time testifying before Congress. Lawmakers dug in on how Amazon uses the data it collects from third-party sellers to inform its own products, and whether it recommend Amazon\u2019s own brands over others.(Bezos owns The Washington Post.)Amazon may have used proprietary data to compete with its merchants, Bezos tells CongressApple\u2019s revenue was also up, growing 11 percent in the third quarter to $59.7 billion and beating Wall Street expectations. \u201cIn uncertain times, this performance is a testament to the important role our products play in our customers\u2019 lives and to Apple\u2019s relentless innovation,\u201d Apple\u2019s Cook said in a news release Thursday.ADThe topic of antitrust scrutiny did not come up in questions from analysts, who focused more on how, exactly, Apple has been able to juice growth in iPhone sales during a global economic and health crisis and when sales had appeared to be declining for more than a year.Apple said some consumers had been waiting for the new iPhone SE for its smaller form factor.Analysts weren\u2019t worried about Apple after Wednesday\u2019s hearing. Gene Munster, an analyst with Loup Ventures, called Apple a \u201cwinner\u201d in an email.\u201cThe topics for Tim Cook largely orbited around the App Store, which we estimate accounts for about 5% of Apple revenue. By comparison, the other tech companies fielded questions that impacted the majority of their revenue,\u201d he wrote. Munster believes the biggest problem for the tech companies is an abstract one: distraction.ADAll four companies\u2019 stock prices climbed in after-hours trading \u2014 spiking more than 5 percent for Facebook, Amazon and Apple. Three of the companies, Amazon, Apple and Alphabet, are already among the most valuable in the world, with market caps of more than $1 trillion.The biggest takeaways from the big-tech antitrust hearing\u201cPutting in rules and breaking up companies isn\u2019t necessarily bad for stock prices,\u201d said Matthew Stoller, the director of research at the American Economic Liberties Project, a Washington think tank devoted to reducing the power of monopolies.He pointed to the breakups of Standard Oil, AT&T and electric utilities, all of which he said were good for investors. \u201cDoes anybody really believe that if you separated AWS (Amazon\u2019s cloud computing division) from the rest of Amazon that it would somehow reduce the value of the aggregate entity? Or course not,\u201d he said.Correction: Apple reported a revenue increase of 11 percent to $59.7 billion.

Subscribe today.arrow-right\u201cLook, Dr. Fauci said, \u2018Don\u2019t wear a mask.\u2019 \u201d\u2014 President Trump, in an interview with Chris Wallace of Fox News, July 19, 2020Over and over, the president has the same three complaints about Anthony S. Fauci, the renowned director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. The three items of dispute all appeared in the Chris Wallace interview, but they have popped up in various interviews since April.ADAs one would expect, Trump\u2019s memory is faulty. Here\u2019s a guide to his gripes.\u2018Dr. Fauci at the beginning said, \u201cThis will pass.\u201d \u2019 Trump often projects his insecurities, and one of his biggest political problems now is that many Americans believe he did not take the emergence of the coronavirus seriously. For weeks in January, February and half of March, Trump played down the threat of the new virus, insisting it would disappear on its own.ADFauci never said anything like \u201cThis will pass.\u201d He spoke as a scientist, evaluating the data in front of him. From the start, he warned of the need to be vigilant.On Jan. 20, Fauci told CNN: \u201cIt really is an evolving situation, and we have to be prepared for the worst. I mean, I don\u2019t think there is cause for panic on anyone\u2019s part, but we certainly need to be following it and watching this very carefully.\u201d A month later, on Feb. 22, he also told CNN, \u201cIf this evolves into a pandemic, there\u2019s no way we in the United States are going to escape having more infections in this country.\u201dADOn Feb. 29, on the \u201cToday\u201d show, Fauci was asked whether daily routines should be changed. \u201cRight now, at this moment, there\u2019s no need to change anything that you\u2019re doing on a day-by-day basis. Right now the risk is still low, but this could change,\u201d he responded. \u201cWhen you start to see community spread, this could change and force you to become much more attentive to doing things that would protect you from spread.\u201dADHe added: \u201cI mean, this could be a major outbreak. I hope not. Or it could be something that\u2019s reasonably well controlled.\u201dLater that same day at a news conference, Fauci noted: \u201cWhen you have cases throughout the world, the way we\u2019re seeing now \u2014 South Korea, Italy, Iran and places like that \u2014 the United States cannot be completely immune to that. The challenge is how we deal with it.\u201dADIn May, as Trump pressed states to reopen faster, Fauci warned of \u201cneedless suffering and death\u201d if states failed to stick to federal guidelines. \u201cIf we skip over the checkpoints in the guidelines \u2026 then we risk the danger of multiple outbreaks throughout the country,\u201d Fauci said. \u201cThis will not only result in needless suffering and death but would actually set us back on our quest to return to normal.\u201dIn other words, Fauci never said \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it.\u201d That was Trump himself:ADFeb. 10: \u201cNow, the virus that we're talking about having to do \u2014 you know, a lot of people think that goes away in April with the heat \u2014 as the heat comes in. Typically, that will go away in April.\u201dFeb. 27: \u201cIt\u2019s going to disappear. One day \u2014 it\u2019s like a miracle \u2014 it will disappear.\u201dJuly 1: \u201cI think we are going to be very good with the coronavirus. I think that, at some point, that\u2019s going to sort of just disappear.\u201d\u2018Dr. Fauci told me not to ban China\u2019Here, Trump takes a little factoid and spins it into a mistruth. We\u2019re not sure exactly what Fauci might have said to Trump, but he did initially express public skepticism about the effectiveness of travel restrictions. \u201cThat would create a lot of disruption economically and otherwise and it wouldn\u2019t necessarily have a positive effect,\u201d Fauci told S&P Global Market Intelligence in a report published Jan. 24.ADOn Jan. 31, Trump announced that, effective Feb. 2, non-U.S. citizens were barred from traveling from China, but there were 11 exceptions. Meanwhile, U.S. citizens and permanent residents could still travel from China but were subject to screening and a possible 14-day quarantine. Trump\u2019s action did not take place in a vacuum. Many airlines were canceling flights, and by our count, at least 38 countries took similar action before or at the same time the U.S. restrictions were put in place.ADBut by the time of the announcement, Fauci was a supporter of the idea. \u201cThese were the uniform recommendations of the career public health officials here at HHS,\u201d Health Secretary Alex Azar said shortly after the announcement. (The National Institutes of Health is part of the Department of Health and Human Services.)The New York Times reported that officials at the National Security Council and the Department of Homeland Security initially pressed for travel restrictions. Once the public health officials, including Fauci, agreed to the idea on Jan. 30, the plan was brought to Trump in an Oval Office meeting: \u201cTrump was skeptical, though he would later claim that everyone around him had been against the idea. The two countries were in delicate trade negotiations. Was this the time to provoke China? he asked. And what about the consequences on the economy?\u201dADFauci publicly supported the travel restrictions \u2014 and similar action against many countries in Europe \u2014 though contrary to Trump\u2019s claim, he offered no calculation on how many lives were saved.ADIn any case, it may have been too late.The New York Times calculated that at least 430,000 people arrived in the United States on direct flights from China since Jan. 1, including nearly 40,000 in the two months after Trump imposed restrictions. Screening was haphazard and inconsistent, according to the Associated Press: \u201cWhen U.S. residents flying from mainland China arrived at U.S. airports, the system meant to flag and monitor them for the development of symptoms lost track of at least 1,600 people in just the first few days the ban went into effect, according to an internal state government email obtained by the AP.\u201dADMeanwhile, a Washington Post examination found that Trump\u2019s abrupt decision to announce European travel restrictions led to one final viral infusion before the United States was forced to shut down, as thousands of Americans rushed to come home and were stuck for hours in crowded airport terminals.\u2018Dr. Fauci said, \u201cDon\u2019t wear a mask.\u201d \u2019Fauci did say this, as did other health experts in the U.S. government. He says he was motivated by early fears that N95 masks needed by hospital workers would quickly run out of stock. Once science indicated that the virus was spread by people who were asymptomatic, the guidance was updated, because even fabric masks can help halt the spread if everyone wears them.ADAD\u201cI don\u2019t regret anything I said then because in the context of the time in which I said it, it was correct. We were told in our task force meetings that we have a serious problem with the lack of PPEs [personal protective equipment] and masks for the health providers who are putting themselves in harm\u2019s way every day to take care of sick people,\u201d he said in an interview with InStyle magazine.\u201cWhen it became clear that the infection could be spread by asymptomatic carriers who don\u2019t know they\u2019re infected, that made it very clear that we had to strongly recommend masks,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the context of when we were not strongly recommending it, it was the correct thing. But our knowledge changed and our realization of the state of the outbreak changed.\u201dHere again, Trump appears to be projecting.ADADThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention changed its guidance on wearing masks on April 3. At the time of the announcement, Trump announced he would not be wearing a mask, stressing that the guidance was voluntary. For weeks, Trump suggested that people who wore masks were making a political statement against him. The Trump campaign even ran Facebook ads mocking former vice president Joe Biden for wearing a mask, complete with an image of a Chinese flag behind him. Trump at one point dismissed a reporter as being \u201cpolitically correct\u201d for wearing a mask.Only on July 20, more than three months after the announcement, did Trump suggest that wearing a mask could be seen as patriotic.(About our rating scale)Send us facts to check by filling out this formSign up for The Fact Checker weekly newsletterThe Fact Checker is a verified signatory to the International Fact-Checking Network code of principles", "comment": "494 Comments", "topic": "Fact Checker"}, {"cover": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/AUTPVFGSMMI6VPNGTAG7BLUEU4.jpghttps://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/AUTPVFGSMMI6VPNGTAG7BLUEU4.jpg", "title": "Pandemic Advice Ignored by Trump Helps Vietnam Fight Virus", "date": "Jul 30, 2020", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/pandemic-advice-ignored-by-trump-helps-vietnam-fight-virus/2020/07/30/48e9b2ae-d212-11ea-826b-cc394d824e35_story.html", "keyword": "China and Security", "website": "the Washington Post", "author": "", "content": "Vietnam beat back its first wave of coronavirus infections by embracing U.S.-supported pandemic strategies that the Trump administration largely ignored.Now the Southeast Asian country is using the plan to combat its first cases in more than three months, seeking to keep its record as one of the few places in the world that hasn\u2019t reported a single Covid-19 death as of this week.Support our journalism. Subscribe today.arrow-rightEven before Vietnam confirmed its first cases in late January, Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc ordered officials to break out the blueprint developed in 2014 during a global health security project, funded in part by US-AID and created with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other organizations. Strict adherence to the plan allowed the country to claim victory over the virus this spring, stamping out clusters.ADADFaced with a resurgence that has similarly confounded Japan, Hong Kong and Australia, Vietnamese authorities are moving to contain a fresh cluster that has led to 36 new cases in the past week, for a total of 459 cases as of Thursday morning. Officials imposed strict quarantines on thousands of people who may have been exposed in the coastal city of Danang, reimposed stay-at-home measures and tightened border and immigration controls to prevent illegal entry.The government is now warning the virus could spread to other regions, including Ho Chi Minh City and the capital of Hanoi, where officials are suspending large gatherings and ordering bars to close.\u201cThe CDC has been working with us and helped us build up a plan that put in place steps to fight against pandemics,\u201d said Tran Dac Phu, senior adviser at the Public Health Emergency Operations Center under the nation\u2019s Ministry of Health. \u201cThe government is now very concerned about a second wave. We continue to work with the CDC and World Health Organization on this.\u201dADADKey to the government\u2019s success so far has been its ability to move quickly to test patients, isolate those who are sick, aggressively trace contacts and quarantine for 14 days those who come in contact with positive cases. It has also been essential to have consistent and transparent communication with the public, said Dr. Matthew Moore, director of the CDC\u2019s Global Health Security Program in Vietnam.The agency, which has been in Vietnam for 20 years and has a staff of 58 in the country including eight Americans, works with the government on testing protocols, guidelines to prevent transmission in health-care settings and training in epidemiology.\u201cTime and time again they have shut down chains of transmission,\u201d he said.ADLaser-Like FocusVietnam, a country whose 96 million citizens had a gross domestic product per capita of $2,715 last year, has been able to control the outbreak because of the government\u2019s laser-like anti-virus focus, a one-party political system and a population that didn\u2019t need convincing as a result of past disease outbreaks. The U.S., with a gross domestic product per capita of $65,280 in 2019, has not.ADVietnam\u2019s success has been globally lauded. The U.S., meanwhile, has surpassed 4.4 million cases and 150,000 deaths while President Donald Trump has consistently downplayed the spread of the virus. Rather than following the advice of the experts, in July he retweeted a post claiming the CDC was lying about the virus.ADThere have been dramatic differences between how Vietnam and U.S. approached the contagion crisis. Within weeks of Vietnam\u2019s first reported cases in late January, the government closed schools. The Trump administration continues to resist school shutdowns, and has even threatened to withhold federal funding from schools that don\u2019t bring back students.Hanoi quickly deploys tests to anyone suspected of exposure to the virus, while the U.S. continues to face testing shortcomings. Danang\u2019s authorities shut down three hospitals where victims visited and ordered patients, their caregivers, medical staff, and workers -- about 6,018 people in all -- to be quarantined for 14 days, according to the city\u2019s health department. Another 3,607 people have been isolated at centralized bases, health centers and homes.ADVietnam has some key advantages the U.S. doesn\u2019t in combating the virus. The Communist Party-controlled government dominates a society with a culture of collectivism, and its tough measures, like willingness to put in place lockdowns when needed, has been met with little resistance from the population.ADThis comes despite the fact that its quarantine regime is uncompromising and one of the strictest in the region. The government has placed Vietnamese and even foreigners seen at high risk of infection into isolation, sometimes at remote military camps.Still, an edge Vietnam has over the U.S. is the consistent message it has sent to the public about combating the virus, said Dr. Todd Pollack, an infectious disease specialist with the Harvard Medical School Partnership for Health Advancement in Vietnam.ADThe government\u2019s communications campaign includes posters in residential and office complexes, text messages, an app to help Vietnamese trace cases near them, regular updates on the Ministry of Health\u2019s website and even a pop song encouraging hand-washing and social distancing.ADPast EpidemicsHelping the country fight the virus has been the memory of past epidemics. The SARS outbreak in 2003 during killed five people in Vietnam and the bird flu led to 52 deaths in repeated outbreaks between 2004 and 2008. The country is also currently coping with a diphtheria outbreak that has caused three deaths, leading the government to isolate 700 people in a village in the coffee-growing Central Highlands province of Dak Lak.Vietnam\u2019s aggressive anti-virus measures have come at a cost: Almost 31 million workers have experienced job losses or pay cuts amid the restrictions. Vietnam\u2019s economy could grow 3% to 4% this year -- half the official target of 6.8%, according to a government advisory council.ADADMeanwhile, the government is getting pushback from some overseas-based companies as it strives to maintain its second-wave vigilance. Companies from South Korea, Vietnam\u2019s second-largest foreign investor, are pressuring the government to lift mandatory two-week quarantines of their workers traveling to Vietnam, local media outlet VnExpress reported.Yet the country\u2019s decisive actions may have burnished its reputation among companies seeking to diversify supply chains away from China. Some Japanese companies, with financial incentives from their government, are looking to relocate operations to Vietnam. Taiwanese company Inventec Corp., Apple Inc.\u2019s assembly partner for AirPods, is preparing to establish a unit in Vietnam and other suppliers of the Cupertino, California-based company may follow.Now the government\u2019s all-hands-on-deck counterattack is kicking in again.ADADHanoi authorities are testing 21,000 people flying back from Danang. The coastal city of Hoi An, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, has been placed on virtual lockdown. Meanwhile, the Health Ministry Thursday sent out an emergency bulletin listing more than two dozen potential virus \u201chotspots\u201d across the country, including a Danang supermarket, a Hanoi pizza restaurant and a Ho Chi Minh City mall. Those who have visited the venues are directed to send their personal information -- and details about those with whom they have been in contact -- to the ministry.(Updates with more quarantines in the 12th paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P.", "comment": "0 Comments", "topic": "Business"}, {"cover": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/KVU2UYWQDAI6VATLZQ4U3ASOGU.jpghttps://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/KVU2UYWQDAI6VATLZQ4U3ASOGU.jpg", "title": "The Health 202: These are the top coronavirus vaccines to watch", "date": "Jul 30, 2020", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/07/30/health-202-these-are-top-coronavirus-vaccines-watch/", "keyword": "China and Security", "website": "the Washington Post", "author": "Paige Winfield Cunningham", "content": "with Paulina FiroziHere\u2019s a bright spot in a summer of otherwise discouraging coronavirus news: The race for a vaccine is going about as well as anyone could have expected.

Subscribe today.arrow-rightIt\u2019s been six months since China first posted online the genetic sequence of the novel coronavirus. Yet already three companies have launched final-stage clinical trials for a vaccine \u2013 at record speed, by any standard \u2013 and another is on the verge of doing so.This month, U.S. companies Moderna and Pfizer launched final Phase 3 trials involving tens of thousands of volunteers. A third company, AstraZeneca, partnered with Oxford University in the United Kingdom, has already been conducting final-stage trials for weeks. And a Chinese company, CanSino Biologics, is expected to announce Phase 3 trials next month.These developers have found promising early results, allowing them to embark upon Phase 3 clinical trials in record time.Their success keeps open the possibility of a vaccine being ready for wide dissemination in early 2021, although that also depends on countries having the infrastructure to administer shots to millions of people.ADAD\u201cThe data so far has been on the high end of expectations,\u201d Ronny Gal, a financial analyst with investment research firm Sanford C. Bernstein and Co., told me.Anthony S. Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease, offered a similar analysis. On Monday, he told CNN he\u2019s \u201ccautiously optimistic\u201d about the Moderna vaccine, which is being developed in collaboration with the National Institutes of Health.Yet there\u2019s still a long way to go before a coronavirus vaccine can be approved by the Food and Drug Administration.\u00a0And officials will face huge challenges in widely disseminating it and deciding who should get it first. Discussions are underway to identify priority groups for initial vaccination, my colleague Lena H. Sun reports.AD\u201cU.S. officials and experts are wrestling with one of the most difficult issues facing the country: Who should be first to get limited doses of a vaccine during one of the worst\u00a0public health crises\u00a0in a century?\u201d Lena writes.\u201cThose discussions, involving federal health officials and outside experts, are based on planning developed during the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic. The highest priority would go to\u00a0health-care\u00a0and essential workers and\u00a0high-risk\u00a0populations. This proposed group would also include older adults, residents of long-term-care facilities and people with\u00a0underlying medical conditions.\u201dIn the meantime, here are four promising vaccine candidates to watch this fall:Moderna's mRNA-1273On Monday, the first volunteers received shots for the company's Phase 3 trial. The trial will test 30,000 participants, half receiving the vaccine and half receiving a placebo. After they each get two doses, spaced several weeks apart, researchers will have to wait to see whether the participants get infected or sick from the coronavirus.ADAD\u201cWhat they hope to witness is a clear benefit: fewer infections in people who received the vaccine, or less severe episodes of covid-19,\u201d Carolyn Y. Johnson reported. \u201cThere are many unknowns about how long it could take to see a clear signal of success or failure \u2014 including how fast the trials will recruit participants and how long it takes for enough people to become infected to observe whether there is an effect.\u201dFauci said Moderna's earlier Phase 1 trial suggested its vaccine created antibody responses in volunteers comparable to what is seen in people who have recovered from actual cases of covid-19.\u201cWe are participating today in the launching of a truly historic event in the history of vaccinology,\u201d he said at a news conference, noting that the United States has never moved faster to develop a vaccine.Pfizer's BNT162The company has announced it is initiating a 30,000-person vaccine trial at 120 sites globally. Volunteers will also receive two doses.ADADBoth the Pfizer and the Moderna vaccines use a new technology called messenger RNA to produce a protein found on SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes the disease covid-19. The promising technology has never been approved for use outside medical research, Carolyn explains.\u201cEither vaccine could become the first in a new class of medicines,\u201d she writes. \u201cThe vaccines deliver a snip of genetic material that carries the blueprint for the spiky protein that dots the surface of the coronavirus. After a person is vaccinated, their cells will follow the genetic instructions to build the proteins, and their immune systems, confronted with the spike protein, learn how to recognize and mount a defense to the virus without ever being infected.\u201dAstraZeneca and Oxford University\u2019s AZD1222The organizations launched an initial Phase 3 trial in May, involving about 1,000 people. It generated a strong immune response in the volunteers, while also causing mild to moderate side effects in about 60 percent of patients, according to a study published July 20 in the Lancet, a prominent medical journal.ADADWorld Health Organization chief scientist\u00a0Soumya Swaminathan has called it \u201cprobably the leading candidate.\u201d Not only is the testing progressing the quickest of any candidate, but AstraZeneca also is conducting it around the world, including in the United Kingdom, Brazil and South Africa, she noted.Governments are investing especially heavily in this vaccine.\u201cThe U.S. government has pledged up to $1.2\u00a0billion toward the Oxford effort and secured a promise of 300\u00a0million doses by October,\u201d Carolyn and William Booth reported. \u201cA European alliance has claimed 400\u00a0million doses, while the British government has dibs on 100\u00a0million doses, alongside another possible candidate being developed by Imperial College London.\u201dADBritish Prime Minister Boris Johnson was pumped about the early-stage results:The vaccine's researchers expressed optimism they can stimulate the production of T cells that can stay in circulation for years and serve as a permanent praetorian guard against infection \u2014 although they acknowledged more research is needed on how long any protection lasts.AD\u201cWe hope this means the immune system will remember the virus, so that our vaccine will protect people for an extended period,\u201d Andrew Pollard, lead author of the Oxford study, said in a statement. \u201cHowever, we need more research before we can confirm the vaccine effectively protects against SARS-CoV-2 infection, and for how long any protection lasts.\u201dCanSino's Ad5-nCoVChina is racing to approve a vaccine before either the United States or the United Kingdom. Its most promising candidate was developed by CanSino, a company that is working to recruit 40,000 people for Phase 3 trials it hopes to conduct in countries including Russia, Brazil and Chile.The Lancet also published a study on this vaccine, which was tested in about 500 people in a Phase 2 trial. Most participants had an immune response, although some also had severe reactions to the shots. While the researchers suggested the vaccine has \u201ca good safety profile,\u201d some scientists were nonetheless disappointed in its early performance and worry it might not work on many people.ADAD\u201cThe vaccine triggered the production of neutralizing antibodies that can block the virus in only about half the test subjects \u2014 59\u00a0percent of those given a high dose and 47\u00a0percent given a lower dose,\u201d William and Carolyn wrote. \u201cOlder people tended to respond less favorably.\u201dAhh, oof and ouchAHH: Negotiations over the latest coronavirus relief bill have hit a barricade, with no clear path in sight.\u00a0\u201cA meeting between top White House officials and Democratic leaders ended with no agreement on extending emergency unemployment benefits that expire Friday or on reviving a moratorium on evictions that lapsed last week,\u201d Erica Werner, Jeff Stein, Seung Min Kim and Rachael Bade report. \u201cThat means some 20 million jobless Americans will lose $600 weekly enhanced unemployment benefits that Congress approved in March, which could send the economy reeling.\u201dTrump said he would support a short-term solution for unemployment insurance as well as a moratorium on evictions, but Democrats shot down the idea.\u00a0ADADThe two parties remain far apart; Democrats insist on their wide-ranging $3 trillion proposal while Republicans struggle to coalesce around a $1 trillion bill released by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Monday. The process overall has been overtaken by increasingly bitter partisanship.\u201cEach side said the other was to blame for the failure,\" Erica, Jeff, Seung Min and Rachael write. \"Paying the price will be the unemployed at a moment of deep uncertainty and fear, with coronavirus cases spiking and states pulling back on reopening as deaths near 150,000 in the United States. The talks could get back on track in coming days, but the signs Wednesday were not promising.\u201d\u00a0OOF: A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from denying green cards to immigrants who have received Medicaid, food stamps or housing vouchers.Judge George B. Daniels, who granted a nationwide temporary injunction on the new eligibility requirements, wrote that the policy \u201cfails to measure up to the gravity of this global pandemic that continues to threaten the lives and economic well-being of America\u2019s residents.\u201dAD\u201cNo person should hesitate to seek medical care, nor should they endure punishment or penalty if they seek temporary financial aid as a result of the pandemic\u2019s impact,\u201d he added.In January, before the pandemic, the Supreme Court had ruled the Trump administration could move ahead with its new plan. New York and several other states had sued, calling it an illegal wealth test for immigrants.New York Attorney General Letitia James:OUCH: There\u2019s growing evidence that young adults are infecting vulnerable elders, especially family members who may share the same home.\u00a0The trend seems confirm what many experts feared as young people returned to bars and restaurants as some cities and states eased social restrictions and healthy young people returned to work. Those young people then transmitted the coronavirus to others who are more vulnerable to the disease, Lenny Bernstein reports.\u201cThe emerging trend highlights the difficulty of relying on the Trump administration\u2019s strategy of sheltering the most vulnerable while the young and healthy return to work and school,\u201d Lenny writes. \u201cThat approach runs the risk of transmitting the virus when two or three generations share the same home and when many lower-income workers have little choice but to brave exposure to do their jobs. Young adults are among the essential workers who may be returning home to parents and grandparents. High-school- and college-age children may expose teachers, parents and grandparents.\u201d\u00a0Some areas with a surge in cases also have larger share of multigenerational families, leaving open more possibility for exposure.\u00a0Lenny adds: \u201cA record 64 million people \u2014 about 20 percent of the U.S. population \u2014 lived in homes with at least two adult generations or grandparents and grandchildren under 25 in 2016, according to an analysis of census data by the Pew Research Center. That is even more true for Hispanics, who have large populations in Florida, the Southwest and California. About 27 percent live in multigenerational households. The figure is similar for black people (26 percent) and Asians (29 percent), Pew found.\u201d\u00a0The editor of the Lancet has become an outspoken critic of how government leaders responded to the pandemic.In a new book, Richard Horton accuses Trump of a \u201ccrime against humanity\u201d for cutting WHO funding during the crisis and also points a finger at Johnson, the British prime minister, for thousands of excess deaths.In an interview with William Booth, he lauded the quick response by the scientific community but chided the inability of governments to heed necessary advice.\u00a0\u201cI was seeing the research community immediately kicking into action, gathering actionable evidence, for use by policymakers and politicians. And nothing was happening,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s not just a failure of politicians. It\u2019s the failure of those medical and science advisers who are giving advice to governments, because I don\u2019t think they picked it up quickly enough, either.\u201d\u00a0Congress on coronavirusRep. Louie Gohmert (R-Tex.), who was meant to travel with Trump, tested positive for the coronavirus.\u00a0The Texas Republican has often refused to wear a mask or maintain social distancing around the Capitol. Now, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said she would announce a new mask mandate for lawmakers on the House floor.The news has prompted senior lawmakers to reconsider their opposition to mandatory coronavirus testing for members of Congress, and White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows said the Trump administration is standing by to help should leaders on Capitol Hill agree on a plan,\u201d Felicia Sonmez, Paul Kane and Josh Dawsey report.\u00a0In one video that appeared to be filmed from his office, Gohmert suggested wearing a mask could increase the chances of contracting the virus.\u201cIt is interesting, and I don\u2019t know about everybody, but when I have a mask on, I\u2019m moving it to make it comfortable, and I can\u2019t help but wonder if that puts some germs in the mask,\u201d Gohmert said.Following the news, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) said House leaders aren't mandating coronavirus testing for members of Congress, but have discussed it in the past, Politico\u2019s Heather Caygle and Sarah Ferris report.\u201cWe\u2019re not mandating testing at this point \u2026 but we\u2019re discussing that,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cWe have discussed it in the past. This is a moment, I think, where we ought to be discussing it again.\u201dIndustry impactAmazon logistics, usually handled by artificial intelligence algorithms, have been thrown into disarray under the pandemic.\u201cHoned on billions of sales and deliveries, these systems accurately predict how much of each item will be sold, when to replenish stock at fulfillment centers, and how to bundle deliveries to minimize travel distances,\u201d Gizmodo\u2019s Ben Dickson reports. \u201cBut as the coronavirus pandemic crisis has changed our daily habits and life patterns, those predictions are no longer valid.\u201d\u00a0That\u2019s in part because of people\u2019s tendency to panic buy in large quantities, said Rajeev Sharma, senior vice president and global head of enterprise AI solutions and cognitive engineering at AI consultancy firm Pactera Edge.\u201cArtificial intelligence algorithms are behind many changes to our daily lives in the past decades. They keep spam out of our inboxes and violent content off social media, with mixed results. They fight fraud and money laundering in banks,\u201d Ben writes. \u201cThey help investors make trade decisions and, terrifyingly, assist recruiters in reviewing job applications. And they do all of this millions of times per day, with high efficiency\u2014most of the time. But they are prone to becoming unreliable when rare events like the covid-19 pandemic happen.\"\u201cAmong the many things the coronavirus outbreak has highlighted is how fragile our AI systems are,\u201d he continues. \"And as automation continues to become a bigger part of everything we do, we need new approaches to ensure our AI systems remain robust in face of black swan events that cause widespread disruptions.\u201dTrump tempTrump has repeatedly bragged about his score on a cognitive test, using as a political tool a test meant to detect early signs of dementia.\u201cHe has used it as a cudgel, attacking the mental acuity of former vice president Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, goading him to take the assessment and saying Biden would not fare as well as him,\u201d William Wan reports. \u201cBut for many Americans, the test Trump keeps trumpeting is one of the most fraught, traumatic turning points in their lives \u2014 that moment when they realize their mind is beginning to fail and glimpse the troubled path ahead for them and their families.\u201dThe test includes about 30 questions to test cognitive skills such as short-term memory, visual cues, language and orientation. It\u2019s a widely used test and an effective screening for the early stages of dementia.\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t understand why he keeps bringing it up as a taunt or threat,\u201d said Melissa Susser, a clinical social worker, who regularly administers the test to senior citizens in the D.C. area. \u201cIt\u2019s not like a political thing.\u201dSusser\u2019s colleague Julia Pruitt told William it could further stigmatize the test among older people who are already nervous and ashamed over taking it.\u00a0Coronavirus latestIn the states:\u00a0An internal report compiled for the White House coronavirus task force says at least 17 of 21 states flagged as \u201cred zones\u201d are not following federal recommendations, according to a special congressional panel formed to review the administration\u2019s coronavirus response, Hannah Knowles writes for The Washington Post\u2019s live blog.Florida pediatricians released new guidelines for school reopenings, which include staggering start times, instituting strict hand-washing and disinfecting protocols, and keeping children and teachers six feet apart, Valerie Strauss reports.Maryland Gov.

The code tracks their movements and determines whether they have been to any risky places. Only those with green codes are allowed in. Many offices insist on green codes, too.

Beijing\u2019s main tourist attractions, such as the Forbidden City, require advance reservations, and masks are compulsory. They also are mandatory on public transport and in taxis.The crisis that shocked the world: U.S. virus responseAs countries around the world try to find the balance between health and economic considerations to deal with a second or third \u2014 or in the case of the United States, first \u2014 wave of the coronavirus, China has found its sweet spot. These controls involve immediate lockdowns, mass testing and the use of surveillance technology to a degree that the ruling Communist Party could only have dreamed of when this year dawned.ADADWhen a cluster erupted around the Xinfadi food market in Beijing last month, municipal authorities confined 75,000 people to their homes and tested 11\u00a0million residents in the space of a few weeks. When traces of the virus were linked to salmon imported from Norway, they even tried to swab the throats of the fish (although it is not clear that salmon have throats).That aside, the efforts worked. One month later, the capital has gone back to its semblance of normality.\u201cI think China has done pretty well in coping with the pandemic,\u201d said Li Yue, who lives near Beijing\u2019s historic drum and bell towers and was taking a break from the heat in the square on Monday.ADThe area would usually be teeming with tourists, but with the towers closed and international tourists shut out of China, it felt like any other neighborhood in the rabbit warren of hutongs, or alleys.AD\u201cLife has returned to 70\u00a0percent to\u00a080\u00a0percent normal,\u201d Li said.

The city, already under strict controls as part of the central government\u2019s efforts to repress the Uighur minority, has ground to a halt as \u201cwartime\u201d measures are enacted. Dozens of cases have been detected in Urumqi, where all 3.5\u00a0million residents are now being tested.In Dalian, in China\u2019s northeast, a new cluster discovered this week has prompted similar restrictions and testing.ADADBut if the responses in these places follow the Beijing pattern, the virus will soon be stamped out there, too.This makes the news out of the United States all the more puzzling for many people in China. Many express confusion at why Americans would object to wearing a mask that could help protect them, as well as surprise that there is not more-widespread testing in a country with such an advanced medical system.\u201cSpeaking from a citizen\u2019s perspective, I think the United States is not doing enough for its people and not caring for the interests of the masses,\u201d said Fiona Tao, a 20-year-old university student who was practicing skateboard moves in the empty square on the other side of the Bell Tower.ADShe was sporting ripped jeans and American sneakers but expressed relief to be living in China, rather than in a country like the United States.AD\u201cI think each country has its own approach, so we can\u2019t criticize them using our standards,\u201d her friend Alexa Zhang said as she drank bubble tea. \u201cIt\u2019s their decision not to take millions of lives seriously.\u201dBeijing carries out mass testing as coronavirus spreadsChina\u2019s leaders, locked in a battle for global dominance with the United States, have been making sure people here know how much worse the outbreak is there. State media have reported every time the U.S. caseload and death toll have crossed another threshold, trying to turn domestic criticism of the Communist Party\u2019s initial missteps into gratitude for its heavy-handed response.ADBut the numbers also help them make this case.More than 4 million people in the United States have been infected, and more than 141,000 have died, exponentially higher than China\u2019s officially reported 86,482 infections and 4,656 deaths. China contained the virus, which emerged in the city of Wuhan at the end of last year, by imposing draconian lockdowns and shutting down large chunks of the economy.ADThis was widely viewed at the time as something that only an authoritarian government could do, although it has been adopted, in varying degrees, in countries from Italy to New Zealand.The friends sitting on their skateboards in the shadow of the Bell Tower agreed that the United States was great at many things, but that China\u2019s political system and its collective culture made it better at dealing with epidemics.AD\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that the United States has better education and a bigger economy,\u201d Tao said.

Subscribe today.arrow-rightOn Monday, as Trump traveled again to the battleground state of North Carolina for a factory tour, reporters asked whether he would pay respects to the late congressman and civil rights leader John Lewis, who is lying in state at the Capitol on Monday and Tuesday. \u201cNo,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI won\u2019t be going, no.\u201dThis is part of a pattern throughout his presidency. Trump has eschewed the traditional role of the president as consoler-in-chief upon the death of people who had publicly criticized him. He has shown little graciousness toward some Capitol Hill legends after they passed away, including Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Reps. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) and John Dingell (D-Mich.).It took 14 hours for Trump to tweet condolences after Lewis died on July 17 at the age of 80 from pancreatic cancer. In the interim, he posted dozens of tweets, including attacks on his opponent Joe Biden, his former national security adviser John Bolton and his niece Mary Trump. Then he golfed with Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.). By the time Trump put out a two-sentence tweet, with 23 words, all four living former presidents, plus Vice President Pence and dozens of lawmakers, had released statements of their own.ADAD\u201cSaddened to hear the news of civil rights hero John Lewis passing. Melania and I send our prayers to he and his family,\u201d Trump wrote.Compare the president\u2019s terse tweet about Lewis, the last surviving member of the Big Six who organized the 1963 March on Washington, to his quick reaction this weekend after former \u201cWho Wants to be a Millionaire\u201d host Regis Philbin died at 88.\u201cOne of the greats in the history of television, Regis Philbin has passed on to even greater airwaves,\u201d Trump wrote. \u201cHe was a fantastic person, and my friend.

And to Joy, his wonderful wife who he loved so much, my warmest condolences!!!\u201dADThe president\u2019s messages about Lewis contained no exclamation marks, but the three broadcast networks preempted regularly scheduled programming to air live coverage of the memorials for the Democratic congressman from Georgia. The son of sharecroppers almost died at 25 when state troopers beat him viciously, cracking his skull, as he led 600 protesters in a march across the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Ala. During 17 terms in Congress, he championed voting rights.Pence visited the Capitol to pay tribute to his former House colleague. Former vice president Biden drove down from Delaware, with his wife, Jill, to honor Lewis. The Bidens placed their hands on the casket. Biden\u2019s potential vice-presidential picks Sens. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), and Reps. Karen Bass (D-Calif.) and Val Demings (D-Fla.), also came. Congressional Republicans were well represented, led by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.) and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (Calif.).ADLawmakers from both parties gave a standing ovation after a recording was played of Lewis calling for racial justice during a 2014 commencement speech at Emory University. \u201cSupreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor, members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper and congressional aides quietly streamed past the flag-draped casket, which was moved to the top of the East Front steps Monday evening for the public to pay tribute,\u201d Paul Kane, Felicia Sonmez, Meagan Flynn and Michael Brice-Saddler report. \u201cThe tributes at the Capitol came shortly after Lewis\u2019s body made its last visit to Washington\u2019s civil rights landmarks midday Monday, pausing at the Lincoln Memorial, where he was the youngest speaker at the 1963 March on Washington. The motorcade also stopped at the Martin Luther King Jr. memorial, and the newly minted Black Lives Matter Plaza outside the White House, where he made his last public appearance in early June.\u201dQuote of the day\u201cEven though the world around him gave him every cause for bitterness, he stubbornly treated everyone with respect and love,\u201d McConnell said of Lewis.White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany defended Trump\u2019s response to Lewis\u2019s death, noting that he signed a proclamation lowering the flag to half-staff to recognize his civil rights work. The U.S. Flag Code, however, already specifies that flags should be flown at half-staff \u201con the day of death and the following day for a Member of Congress.\u201dADADLewis is only the second black lawmaker in American history to lay in state in the Capitol. The other was Cummings, a close friend, who died in October. Trump also skipped Cummings\u2019s ceremony and funeral. (In addition to Graham, the president visited the Capitol in December 2018 when former president George H.W. Bush was lying in state.)Lewis and Cummings were both outspoken Trump critics. Lewis refused to attend Trump\u2019s inauguration in 2017 on the rationale that he was an illegitimate president because of Russian interference in the previous year\u2019s election. (There is no evidence that any votes were changed. Lewis had also refused to attend George W. Bush\u2019s inauguration in 2001.)Trump lashed out at the congressman, accusing him of being \u201call talk\u201d with \u201cno action or results,\u201d a tone-deaf critique that dominated multiple news cycles. Lewis and other African Americans in Congress later declined to attend the dedication of a civil rights museum in Mississippi because Trump was scheduled to come, as well.ADADLast August, a few months before Cummings died, Trump appeared to poke fun at the congressman after his Baltimore house was burglarized, tweeting: \u201cReally bad news! \u2026 Too bad!\u201d The president later denied he was being facetious after several Republicans had criticized the message, telling reporters on his way to golf at his club in New Jersey that he was not trying to be a \u201cwise guy.\u201d But it had followed days of Trump relentlessly ripping Cummings, who as chairman of the House Oversight Committee was scrutinizing his conduct and issuing subpoenas to his administration. Trump called the city Cummings represented \u201ca rodent infected mess,\u201d said residents are \u201cliving in hell,\u201d blamed Cummings for the city\u2019s problems and claimed that thousands of African Americans had thanked him for spotlighting the city\u2019s problems.Indeed, some of their friends might have been relieved that Trump stayed away from the memorial events. Bass, the chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, tweeted at Trump shortly after Lewis\u2019s death: \u201cWhile the nation mourns the passing of a national hero, please say nothing. Please don\u2019t comment on the life of Congressman Lewis.\u201dTrump skipped McCain\u2019s funeral at the request of the family of the 2008 GOP presidential nominee. The president had said during the 2016 campaign that the former prisoner of war in Vietnam was not a war hero because he got captured. Trump has continued to attack McCain since his death, especially for his decisive vote against the repeal of the Affordable Care Act.ADADOn the night Trump was impeached by the House in December, he suggested during a rally in Michigan that Dingell was \u201clooking up\u201d at the crowd from hell. The president then laced into Rep. Debbie Dingell (D-Mich.), his widow who now holds his seat. Dingell was the longest-serving member of the House in U.S. history and had died just months earlier. Trump did not attend his funeral.The \u201clooking up\u201d riff came the week before Christmas, and the congresswoman replied on Twitter: \u201cMy husband earned all his accolades after a lifetime of service. I\u2019m preparing for the first holiday season without the man I love. You brought me down in a way you can never imagine and your hurtful words just made my healing much harder.\u201dCoronavirus falloutTwitter penalized Donald Trump Jr. for posting hydroxychloroquine misinformation.\u201cThe platform ordered the president\u2019s son to delete the misleading tweet and said it would \u2018limit some account functionality for 12 hours,\u2019\u201d Katie Shepherd and Taylor Telford report. \u201cOn Monday evening, Facebook scrubbed from its site a viral video showing a group of doctors making misleading and false claims about the coronavirus pandemic after more than 14 million people had watched it. Hours later, President Trump tweeted out multiple clips of the same video to his 84.2 million followers. Trump shared the video \u2014 which claims that face masks and shutdowns are not needed to stop the spread of the virus \u2014 as he shared 14 tweets over a half-hour span defending the use of hydroxychloroquine, an antimalarial drug that the president has repeatedly promoted \u2026 Twitter soon followed Facebook and YouTube in removing the videos, deleting several of the tweets that Trump shared, and even adding a note to its trending topics warning about the potential risks of hydroxychloroquine use.\u201dThe GOP gave Trump money for the new FBI headquarters he wants a block from his hotel.\u201cUnder intense White House pressure, Senate Republicans agreed Monday to allocate $1.75 billion in their coronavirus relief bill toward the construction of a new D.C. headquarters for the FBI,\u201d Jonathan O'Connell, Seung Min Kim and Erica Werner report. \u201cBut top Senate Republicans immediately began distancing themselves from the provision after it was made public, saying they weren\u2019t sure why the White House repeatedly insisted on putting it in the bill. At a news conference Monday, [McConnell] initially denied that the FBI money was in the bill, but then was notified by reporters that the language was in fact included. \u2018You\u2019ll have to ask them why they insisted that be included,\u2019 he told reporters, referring to the White House. \u2026 Asked Monday what a new FBI building had to do with the novel coronavirus, Sen. Richard C. Shelby (R-Ala.), a key negotiator of the stimulus package, paused and said, \u2018Good question.\u2019 \u2026ADAD\u201cBefore Trump was elected, officials at his company raised concerns about a competing hotel possibly being built in place of the Hoover Building should the FBI relocate to the suburbs. \u2026 Concerns over Trump\u2019s financial interests, however, prompted the Justice Department\u2019s Inspector General Michael E. Horowitz to launch an investigation of the decision-making that led to the cancellation of the original plan. That investigation remains ongoing more than a year later, the inspector general\u2019s office said Monday. A spokeswoman declined to comment further.\u201dDemocrats were sharply critical of the White House demand. \u201cThey managed to have enough money for $2 billion for the FBI headquarters that benefits Trump hotel and they say they have no money for food assistance,\u201d said Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.). \u201cWhat the heck is going on?\u201d (I wrote Friday about how Trump\u2019s demand for this money in the coronavirus package is the latest example of how he doesn\u2019t have his eye on the ball as cascading crises buffet the country.)McConnell has said this bill will likely represent the last major legislative response by congressional Republicans to the coronavirus pandemic. \u201cSenate Republicans\u2019 legislation, titled the \u2018Heals Act,\u2019 is expected to kick off negotiations with congressional Democrats, who have already vowed to oppose many of the provisions in the Republican plan,\u201d Jeff Stein, Laura Meckler and Tony Romm report. \u201cHouse Democrats in May approved a $3 trillion coronavirus response package that sharply diverges from McConnell\u2019s bill in key ways, leaving the path toward a final compromise unclear on many key questions. \u2026 The legislation is also notable for what it leaves out, as the GOP opted against including new funding for state and local governments and hazard pay for essential front-line workers \u2026 McConnell\u2019s bill includes a five-year \u2018liability shield\u2019 aimed at preventing businesses, universities, schools and hospitals from being sued over coronavirus-related damages.\u201dADADThe Senate bill fails to extend the suspension of federal student loan payments beyond September, drawing the ire of consumer advocates who are urging Congress to offer more help to the 43 million Americans holding $1.6 trillion in education debt. (Danielle Douglas-Gabriel)But the GOP legislation does offer a 100 percent deduction on business meals through the end of 2020 to help high-end restaurants. Experts note that few businesses are paying for their employees to eat out during the pandemic. (I wrote in March about how Trump started pushing for this after he got a phone call from celebrity chef Wolfgang Puck.)Several GOP senators got other stuff they wanted to secure their support for the bill. \"McConnell and his team worked for days to try to put together a $1 trillion package that could unite Republicans in a way that would strengthen their negotiating power with Democrats, but there were signs Monday that Republicans remain split over how to proceed,\u201d Erica, Jeff and Seung Min report. \u201cNew parts of the legislation included a proposal from Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) aimed at bringing production lines back to the United States from China, legislation by Sen. John Cornyn (R-Tex.) that would increase incentives for advanced chip manufacturing, and a measure written by Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio) that would address intellectual property theft at federal funded research centers and universities.\u201dADADSen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.), who clashed last week with Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) over deficit spending, said last night that \u201cthere is significant resistance to yet another trillion dollars\u201d: \u201cThe answer to these challenges will not simply be shoveling cash out of Washington; the answer to these challenges will be getting people back to work. And as it stands now, I think it\u2019s likely that you\u2019ll see a number of Republicans in opposition to this bill and expressing serious concerns.\u201dPPP was intended to keep employees on the payroll. Workers at some big companies have yet to be rehired.\u201cIf the name of the Paycheck Protection Program didn\u2019t make its purpose clear, its key sponsors spelled it out. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) explained that the program \u2018was designed as an alternative for unemployment and to prevent unemployment,\u2019\u201d Peter Whoriskey reports. \u201cBut a closer look at three large companies that received millions from the $517 billion program shows that some companies have not retained most of their staff on the payrolls. \u2026 And the Omni Hotels & Resorts, owned by Texas billionaire Robert Rowling, were approved for multiple loans from the program \u2014 one for each of 15 hotels \u2014 totaling $30 million to $71 million. But seven remain closed, and at those, most workers are on unpaid furloughs, union officials said. The company also has declined union requests to continue to pay health insurance for furloughed workers, union officials said.\u201dTemp agencies were some of the biggest beneficiaries of PPP. Many have been able to turn the government loans into profits.

Meanwhile, renters face more job losses and fear eviction,\u201d Heather Long reports. \u201cFor Realtor James Dietsche, there is only one way to describe the real estate market right now: \u2018It\u2019s insane.\u2019 A 1950s style three-bedroom home he listed in late June for $200,000 in a small town outside Harrisburg, Pa., received 26 offers the initial weekend it was for sale. Many buyers were young couples seeking a starter home and retirees looking to downsize. But bids also came from Philadelphia, New York City and the Washington, D.C., area. One person was willing to pay up to $50,000 above asking. Several were offering to buy it without inspections.\u201cWhile Dietsche\u2019s cellphone has been ringing with eager buyers, Tammy Steen\u2019s phone has been buzzing for a different reason. Her landlord keeps calling demanding the $700 rent she does not have. Steen, 52, was a hotel housekeeper at a Hampton Inn in Pensacola, Fla. Her temporary layoff now looks permanent. She has yet to receive unemployment aid despite applying in late March. She has applied to countless fast food, retail and maid jobs but has not been hired. She has started selling hot dogs on the side of the road to beachgoers, praying she does not become homeless.\"Two potential coronavirus vaccines are moving into the last phase of testing with 30,000-person trials.Anthony S.

As the virus and related lockdown orders have disrupted trade routes, closed markets and isolated millions from food and medicine, about 128,000 additional children under 5 will die over the outbreak\u2019s first year, their analysis shows,\u201d per Teo Armus. \u201cModeling food supplies in 118 countries, the experts found that measures to contain the virus \u2014 from social distancing and school closures to lockdowns and closed borders \u2014 have pushed communities already stricken with hunger and other woes over the edge. More than half of all deaths, they said, were in sub-Saharan Africa and in war-torn Yemen. Their study was accompanied by an urgent call to action from the heads of several U.N. agencies, including the World Health Organization and UNICEF, who urged global leaders to contribute at least $2.4 billion immediately to address hunger.\u201d (Read the Lancet article here.)Trump reportedly announced he would throw the first pitch at a Yankees game because he was jealous of Fauci.\u201cAn hour before Dr. Anthony S. Fauci threw the first pitch at the season opener between the New York Yankees and the Washington Nationals, President Trump stood on the briefing room stage at the White House and declared that he, too, had been invited to throw out his own opening pitch. Mr. Trump had not actually been invited on that day by the Yankees, according to one person with knowledge of Mr. Trump\u2019s schedule. His announcement surprised both Yankees officials and the White House staff,\u201d the New York Times reports. \u201cBut Mr. Trump had been so annoyed by Dr. Fauci\u2019s turn in the limelight, an official familiar with his reaction said, that he had directed his aides to call Yankees officials \u2026 After the president\u2019s announcement, White House aides scrambled to let the team know that he was actually booked on Aug. 15, although they have not said what he plans to do. Over the weekend, Mr. Trump officially canceled. \u2026\u201cDr. Fauci\u2019s broadcast appearances are generally controlled by the White House, but the appearance at Nationals Park did not have to go through the usual clearance process at the National Institutes of Health, which takes in his other news media and event requests. \u2026 Off the baseball field, Dr. Fauci\u2019s star turn has not gone over as well in the White House. \u2026 As the prominence of the coronavirus task force faded in recent weeks, Dr. Fauci was left out of a new group of White House officials that meets on the virus, led by Jared Kushner, the president\u2019s son-in-law\u2026\u201dThe Marlins\u2019 coronavirus outbreak won\u2019t derail MLB\u2019s just-opened season \u2014 at least not yet.\u201cFor now, the outbreak among members of the Miami Marlins \u2014 with 11 players and two coaches testing positive by Monday, according to an official familiar with the testing \u2014 has not brought down the entire MLB season, and MLB officials hoped the outbreak would be limited to the Marlins, allowing the season to go forward,\u201d Dave Sheinin reports. \"While MLB officials stressed the outbreak was limited to just one team, other teams, including the Cincinnati Reds and Atlanta Braves, have experienced multiple positive tests or symptomatic players in recent days. And if an outbreak spreads across one team, it increases the likelihood of the virus being transmitted to an opponent or \u2014 in the case of the Yankees, who were about to use the same visiting clubhouse at Philadelphia\u2019s Citizens Bank Park that the Marlins just vacated \u2014 potentially a third team as well. Ten other MLB games scheduled for Monday went forward as expected (though one was eventually rained out), but the Marlins remained under self-quarantine at their Philadelphia hotel awaiting results of teamwide coronavirus tests. \u2026\u201cThe NBA and NHL open their seasons this week, the former in a bubble in Florida, the latter with a hub city model in Toronto and Edmonton. Players, staff and media were all required to quarantine before entering the bubble and are not permitted to leave the secure premises. However, baseball\u2019s experience over the past few days \u2014 launching a 60-game season starting four months after its original Opening Day and played entirely without fans \u2014 presents a sobering outlook for the NFL and college football, both of which hope to play full seasons without bubbles and without the inherent social distancing that baseball, at least theoretically, provides.\u201dThe Minnesota Vikings revealed that Eric Sugarman, the team\u2019s head athletic trainer and coronavirus infection control officer, tested positive, along with members of his family.

(Tennessean)Divided AmericaThe Trump administration is sending more federal agents to Portland, Ore.\u201cThe U.S. Marshals Service decided last week to send more deputies to Portland, \u2026 with personnel beginning to arrive last Thursday night. The Department of Homeland Security is also considering a plan to send an additional 50 U.S. Customs and Border Protection personnel to the city,\u201d Devlin Barrett, Nick Miroff, Marissa J. Lang and David Fahrenthold report. \u201cThat may yet work as a campaign tactic, if it provides Trump a way to sell himself as a law-and-order candidate, the antidote to chaos that developed on his own watch. But as a policing tactic, it has failed to suppress the protests. The escalation has been followed by larger, better-equipped and more-aggressive crowds, and \u2014 as the new reinforcements showed \u2014 it exhausted federal resources before it exhausted the protesters. \u2026\u201cThere is growing concern among federal law enforcement officials that some individuals in the crowds outside the courthouse have gotten more aggressive in recent days, and that the number of federal agents on site may not be sufficient to handle them. Protesters have injured federal agents with large commercial-grade fireworks while others aimed lasers at their eyes, leading to several injuries, DHS officials said. Now officials and demonstrators in other cities that have experienced ongoing protests against police violence fear that federal agents will bring the same tactics to them. \u2026 Some federal law enforcement officials worry that agents in Portland may be losing control of the streets around the federal courthouse and losing the public debate over their handling of the unrest.\"\u201cA protest in Austin turned fatal on Saturday when a driver navigated his vehicle toward the marchers and fired at 28-year-old protester Garrett Foster, who had brought an assault rifle to a march, police said. The driver \u2014 fired upon by a third armed man at the scene \u2014 was not injured, officials said, and police released him while their investigation continued. On Sunday evening, other protesters remembered Foster, who had been a regular at past marches about police brutality. They said his death would inspire others to join the cause, chanting, \u2018He didn\u2019t die, he multiplied!\u2019 But some worry that the incident will lead to more guns at the protests, increasing the chances of violence.\u201dThe mayors of Portland and five other major U.S. cities asked Congress to make it illegal for the federal government to deploy militarized agents to cities that don\u2019t want them. \u201cThis administration\u2019s egregious use of federal force on cities over the objections of local authorities should never happen,\u201d the mayors of Portland, Seattle, Chicago, Kansas City, Albuquerque, New Mexico, and Washington wrote in their open letter. (AP)Attorney General William P. Barr will tell the House Judiciary Committee today that Trump has not inappropriately intervened in Justice Department business \u2014 even though Barr has more than once moved in criminal cases to help the president\u2019s allies \u2014 and he will defend the administration\u2019s response to civil unrest, Matt Zapotosky and Karoun Demirjian report.A military officer\u2019s account undermines the administration\u2019s justifications for clearing Lafayette Square.\u201cAn Army National Guard officer who witnessed protesters forcibly removed from Lafayette Square last month is contradicting claims by the attorney general and the Trump administration that they did not speed up the clearing to make way for the president\u2019s photo opportunity minutes later,\u201d Tom Jackman and Carol Leonnig report. \u201cA new statement by Adam D. DeMarco, an Iraq veteran who now serves as a major in the D.C. National Guard, also casts doubt on the claims by acting Park Police Chief Gregory Monahan that violence by protesters spurred Park Police to clear the area at that time with unusually aggressive tactics. DeMarco said that \u2018demonstrators were behaving peacefully\u2019 and that tear gas was deployed in an \u2018excessive use of force.\u2019 \u201cDeMarco backs up law enforcement officials who told The Washington Post they believed the clearing operation would happen after the 7 p.m. curfew that night \u2014 but it was dramatically accelerated after [Barr] and others appeared in the park around 6 p.m. Monahan has said the operation was conducted so that a fence might be erected around the park. DeMarco said the fencing materials did not arrive until 9 p.m. \u2014 hours after Barr told the Park Police to expand the perimeter -- and the fence wasn\u2019t built until later that night. \u2026 DeMarco is scheduled to testify Tuesday before the House Natural Resources Committee, which is investigating the government\u2019s actions \u2026 \u201cAs the federal and local police waded into the protesters, DeMarco said he saw smoke being used and that he was told by a Park Police officer it was \u2018stage smoke,\u2019 not tear gas. But DeMarco said, \u2018I could feel irritation in my eyes and nose, and based on my previous exposure to tear gas in my training at West Point and later in my Army training, I recognized that irritation as effects consistent with CS or \u2018tear gas.\u2019\u2019 He said he found spent tear gas canisters on the street later.\u201dCongress has battled airlines, banks, tobacco and baseball.

Asked whether Maryanne knew her quotes would be in the book, Mary Trump said that they came from conversations that took place before she planned to write a book.

Subscribe today.arrow-rightThrough distinct lenses, two new books underscore this long-standing tension between Congress and the executive branch and, on a deeper level, the United States\u2019 conflicted relationship with its identity as a nation of immigrants. In \u201cOne Mighty and Irresistible Tide: The Epic Struggle Over American Immigration, 1924-1965,\u201d Jia Lynn Yang pans wide across the often overlooked 40-year battle to overhaul racist and restrictive immigration laws passed in the early 20th century. The book culminates in the passage of the 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act, or the Hart-Celler Act, which Yang credits for her own family\u2019s immigration to the United States from Taiwan and China \u2014 and which has become the bedrock of our current immigration system.In \u201cSeparated: Inside an American Tragedy,\u201d Jacob Soboroff zooms in on President Trump and his administration\u2019s decision to separate children from their parents as a deterrent to border crossers. In doing so, he illuminates how, in the face of congressional inaction, a cadre of presidential advisers can introduce policies with shocking, unintended consequences.ADADMuch has been written in recent years about the 1965 immigration law, which prioritized family-linked visas and ended the national-origins quotas favoring White Northern Europeans. But Yang, deputy national editor at the New York Times and a former Washington Post editor, digs into the tectonic geopolitical shifts that led to the law\u2019s passage. Along the way, she reminds her audience that the current president\u2019s divisive and at times racist, anti-immigrant rhetoric is hardly an outlier in American history.While a Broadway-bound play, \u201cThe Melting Pot,\u201d opened in D.C. in 1908 to applause from none other than President Theodore Roosevelt, a little more than a decade later, Yang reminds us, prominent lawmakers in Washington were calling the phrase obsolete. \u201cWe no longer are to be a haven, a refuge, for oppressed the whole world over. We found we could not be . . . and America will cease to become a melting pot,\u201d declared Sen. David A. Reed of Pennsylvania shortly before the passage of the 1924 immigration law that bears his name. The law shut the door on immigration from Japan, the last Asian country whose citizens could still receive U.S. visas, and it slashed immigration from Southern and Eastern Europe for several decades.Congress\u2019s actions carried weight across the Atlantic, where Yang describes a young Adolf Hitler heaping praise on the United States for barring \u201cthe immigration of physically unhealthy elements\u201d and \u201ccertain races.\u201dEven the 1965 reform and its focus on family connections over skill sets were due in part to a core group of lawmakers who believed that the law would favor the country\u2019s historic Northern European stream over newer influxes from Africa, Asia and other parts of the world.Yang sketches lively portraits of the famous and obscure players behind the legislative fights, like Rep. Emanuel Celler, a freshman congressman who came to Washington from Brooklyn in 1923 and found himself a \u201clost soul,\u201d aching for his wife and baby daughter, but who, like a number of Jewish lawmakers and advocates, became a stalwart defender of postwar refugees and other immigrants. Then there was Takao Ozawa, who arrived in the United States at 19 and petitioned unsuccessfully for the right of Japanese immigrants like himself to become U.S. citizens, arguing in 1915: \u201cIn name, General Benedict Arnold was an American, but at heart he was a traitor. In name, I am not an American, but at heart I am a true American.\u201dADADThe book underscores how many of the nearly century-old debates over our immigration system remain in play: whether the country should prioritize immigrants with high-demand skills over those with family; whether championing immigrants comes at the expense of working-class Americans; the way immigrants are often pushed to \u201cclimb the social ladder\u201d by acquiring \u201cwhiteness\u201d and distancing from African Americans; and more broadly, whether our nation will cling to its Anglo-European roots or more fully embrace its growing diversity.At times, the details of the backroom negotiations become mind-numbing. And one is reminded why even historians often shed all but a few protagonists in service of a tight and linear narrative. Yet Yang\u2019s voyage across early-20th-century U.S. immigration debates makes palpable how much diplomacy and perseverance are required to win legislative change. That it took the United States 40 years to throw out the majority of its most-racist immigration policies and modernize its system might offer some hope to those who have been fighting nearly as long to overhaul the latest incarnation of this law.The 1965 law had another legacy: the first limits on immigration from Latin America. In  \u201cSeparated,\u201d Soboroff, an NBC and MSNBC correspondent, zeros in on the resulting influx of undocumented immigrants across the southern border and, in the absence of congressional action, the Trump administration\u2019s response: a hastily developed policy of separating parents and children without a plan for tracking and reuniting them.ADADAlthough such separations had been carried out occasionally under previous administrations, Soboroff describes how, only weeks after Trump\u2019s inauguration, officials began discussing whether to implement the tactic on a widespread level. The idea was that immigrants crossing illegally, and even some who presented themselves at official points of entry, could immediately be detained and potentially prosecuted for criminal entry, while their children would be whisked away hundreds or thousands of miles to shelters normally reserved for unaccompanied minors.Soboroff quotes one Health and Human Services staffer\u2019s email from late September 2017, criticizing the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s operations. \u201cThey don\u2019t understand .\u2009.\u2009. these types of cases often end with parent repatriated and kid in our care for months pending home studies, international legal issues, etc.\u201dBut they did understand, Soboroff insists. Many parents, who often couldn\u2019t read the English forms they were given, would sign over their rights to seek asylum and to reunite with their children in the United States, while the children wondered why their parents had abandoned them.ADADWith the immediacy of cable news, Soboroff attempts to reconstruct the quiet run-up to the public acknowledgment of the policy, including one official\u2019s efforts to destroy the internal list of separated parents and children. He interweaves this reporting with his own on-the-ground work as one of the first journalists to enter detention facilities holding the separated children. And he follows Juan and Jos\u00e9, a Guatemalan father and son seeking asylum who are swept into the maw of the separation machine.\u201cThis place is called a shelter, but effectively these kids are incarcerated,\u201d a stunned Soboroff tells his MSNBC colleague, anchor Chris Hayes, in June 2018, moments after witnessing some 1,500 boys being held in a converted former Walmart.Soboroff, who acknowledges that he came to the story late, offers generous recognition to fellow journalists and the advocates who saw the looming crisis well before he did \u2014 though an index and detailed endnotes would have made it easier to keep track of their findings and given the book a heftier feel. Ultimately, the reporter is the protagonist, providing the book\u2019s strength and emotional core, but also at times making it seem overly self-referential.ADADTrump signed an order to officially end the mass family separations in late June 2018, following a public outcry, though it\u2019s unclear how many children remain separated \u2014 in large part because of poor record-keeping. Meanwhile, the administration has sought to replace the program with longer family detentions and to cut down on those even permitted to apply for asylum.Congress is unlikely to act on immigration in the remaining months of this election cycle. And the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to fast-track the deportation of asylum seekers means people like Juan and Jos\u00e9 could easily be sent back to their countries before lawmakers ever step in. A lasting solution to the crisis at the border must come from Congress and will probably be as hard-won this time as it was in the 20th century. As both Soboroff and Yang demonstrate, it will inevitably require a reckoning with both the history and the present story we tell ourselves about America being a nation of immigrants. \u201cLike any myth,\u201d Yang writes, \u201cthe idea easily goes unexamined \u2014 exalted and treated as if it were a divine, immutable basis for this country\u2019s existence, when it is the work of human beings, easily erased by other human beings.\u201d", "comment": "0 Comments", "topic": "Outlook"}, {"cover": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/SWNDVHWFIAI6VKM7HO677MNPHA.jpghttps://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/SWNDVHWFIAI6VKM7HO677MNPHA.jpg", "title": "Britain bars Huawei from its 5G wireless networks, part of a growing shift away from the Chinese tech giant", "date": "Jul 15, 2020", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/britain-to-bar-huawei-from-its-5g-wireless-networks-part-of-a-growing-shift-away-from-the-chinese-tech-giant/2020/07/13/44f6afee-c448-11ea-b037-f9711f89ee46_story.html", "keyword": "China and Security", "website": "the Washington Post", "author": "Ellen NakashimaWilliam Booth", "content": "Britain will bar new deployments of Huawei equipment in its fledgling high-speed 5G network, the government said Tuesday, delivering a major blow to the Chinese technology giant and a significant win for the Trump administration, which has been pressing allies to shun the firm.Support our journalism.

For slower 3G and 4G mobile phone systems, the British government said providers should remove and replace most of the older Huawei gear over the next few years.UK may phase out Huawei in 5GThe United States has effectively banned Huawei and other Chinese companies from its nascent 5G platforms \u2014 wireless telecommunications networks seen as the key to revolutionary advances in the way people live, work and play. For much of the past two years, the Trump administration has sought, often seemingly in vain, to persuade allies to follow suit. In May, the United States imposed an export control that cut Huawei off from a key source of semiconductors made with U.S. technology, leading British officials to doubt they could count on the security of Huawei\u2019s equipment.ADADNow, with Britain joining the anti-Huawei fold, all \u201cFive Eye\u201d members of the world\u2019s most powerful intelligence-sharing alliance \u2014 Britain, the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand \u2014 or wireless carriers in their countries have effectively excluded or are moving to exclude Chinese firms from their 5G networks.U.S. pushes hard for a ban on Huawei in Europe, but its prices are nearly irresistibleSecretary of State Mike Pompeo welcomed the British action. \u201cWith this decision, the [United Kingdom] joins a growing list of countries from around the world that are standing up for their national security by prohibiting the use of untrusted, high-risk vendors,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cThe momentum in favor of secure 5G is building.\u201dHuawei\u2019s reversal of fortune in Britain will have major implications for countries that have not made final decisions on their 5G approach, especially Germany, Europe\u2019s largest telecom market.ADADIn March, the Danish telecom company TDC snubbed Huawei in awarding its 5G contract to European vendors. In June, the four largest telecom providers in Canada and Singapore did the same. And last week, Reuters reported that TIM, one of the largest wireless companies in Italy, has excluded Huawei from bidding on its 5G core networks.Over the past year, five European countries, including Poland, Estonia and the Czech Republic, have signed agreements with the United States ensuring that 5G suppliers would not be subject to control by a foreign government without independent judicial review \u2014 a standard that effectively excludes Chinese firms.\u201cThe writing\u2019s on the wall in Europe,\u201d said Paul Triolo, who heads the Eurasia Group\u2019s global technology policy practice. \u201cThere\u2019s no way that Huawei will remain a big supplier there.\u201dADADOn Tuesday, Ed Brewster, a spokesman for Huawei UK, called the British government\u2019s decision \u201cbad news for anyone in the UK with a mobile phone.\u201dThe pullback from Huawei \u201cthreatens to move Britain into the digital slow lane, push up bills and deepen the digital divide,\u201d Brewster said in a statement. \u201cInstead of \u2018levelling up\u2019 the government is levelling down and we urge them to reconsider.\u201d\u00a0Although 27 European governments have agreed to a common approach to mitigate 5G security risks, each state may implement the upgrade in its own way. Some, like Italy, France and the Netherlands, have passed laws that enable the government to veto a carrier\u2019s choice of a 5G provider. Others, like Belgium, ban \u201chigh risk\u201d vendors such as Huawei and ZTE, another Chinese firm, in the core network and cap their presence at 35 percent in the periphery. Still others, such as Spain and Portugal, have yet to decide.ADAD\u201cThe direction of travel in the biggest countries is toward a substantial reduction in Huawei\u2019s market share, and a gradual phasing out of the company over time,\u201d said Noah Barkin, an expert on Europe-China relations at Rhodium Group, a New York-based independent research organization.Other major economies have taken steps over the past year to fence off their 5G systems from Chinese firms. In Japan and South Korea, government rules effectively exclude them. In Israel, Chinese companies have been absent from 3G and 4G platforms and will be kept out of 5G as well.In India, which has not yet built its 5G system, the government last month barred two state-run firms from using Chinese gear. The order came in the wake of security clashes on India\u2019s disputed border with China in which 20 Indian soldiers were killed.ADADHuawei and ZTE are far from vanquished. Two of Europe\u2019s largest carriers, Deutsche Telekom and Vodafone, make extensive use of Huawei equipment and are resistant to switching suppliers. Huawei and ZTE comprise 85 to 90 percent of the 5G market in China, which accounts for about half the global market. And they are making a concerted push to win business in Latin America and Africa.The Chinese ambassador to Britain, Liu Xiaoming, warned London last week that excluding Huawei from 5G will \u201csend out the very wrong message.\u201d He stressed the growth in Chinese investment in Britain. \u201cIf you want to make China a hostile country,\u201d he said, \u201cyou have to bear the consequences.\u201dBut China hard-liners in Washington embraced Tuesday\u2019s decision.ADSen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) said London \u201cmade the right call\u201d on barring Huawei. \u201cThe special relationship is stronger now, as are our joint efforts to expose the threats\u201d that the Chinese Communist Party and its \u201csurveillance puppet\u201d pose \u201cto the free world,\u201d he said.ADSome of China\u2019s recent actions have soured European countries on Huawei.\u201cThe coronavirus crisis and China\u2019s very aggressive approach to shaping the narrative and capitalizing on global distraction have added to the concerns about China in Europe,\u201d said Janka Oertel, Berlin-based director of the Asia Program at the European Council on Foreign Relations.The European Union, she noted, recently accused China of a concerted effort to spread disinformation about the coronavirus pandemic. In Europe \u201cthe Chinese could have scored a big win,\u201d Oertel said. \u201cBut their actions backfired.\u201dADThe U.S. pressure campaign, which began in 2018, initially was not very effective in Western Europe. Officials perceived it as part of the U.S. trade dispute with China and bristled at what they saw as heavy-handed tactics, including threats to curb intelligence-sharing if allies did not bar Huawei.AD\u201cThe Trump administration polluted the debate in Europe,\u201d Barkin said. \u201cInstead of a question of \u2018Is it in our national interests to exclude Huawei?\u2019 it became \u2018Are we going to follow the orders of the Trump administration?\u2019 And a lot of people didn\u2019t want to do that.\u201dFor a long time, European officials wanted a \u201csmoking gun\u201d proving Huawei was a security threat, and intelligence shared by the United States was not convincing, European officials said.Over time, Trump administration officials moderated their rhetoric, underscoring not only the risks of surveillance but also the threat of network disruption. Officials began to refer to the Chinese Communist Party, not just the Chinese government, as a malign actor that through a new national intelligence law could compel any Chinese firm to conduct surveillance on its behalf. And they stressed their arguments had nothing to do with trade.\u201cWe really pivoted that discussion over time,\u201d said Robert Strayer, deputy assistant secretary of state for cyber policy. \u201cIf you fully understand the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s intent in the way the system works in China, there\u2019s not autonomy for those companies. You just need to understand the characteristics of modern technology, updated instantaneously with a software patch that has the vulnerability or the disruption coded into it \u2014 and you can\u2019t inspect your way out of the problem.\u201dLast year, the Trump administration placed Huawei on a blacklist that banned the export of U.S. technology to Huawei without Commerce Department permission. But significantly, Huawei still was able to purchase a vast quantity of semiconductors made outside the United States with U.S. software and equipment.So in May, Commerce tightened the export ban, blocking overseas shipments to Huawei of foreign-made semiconductors made with U.S. technology. The extension of the ban to Huawei-designed chips was key. It meant that Huawei\u2019s main semiconductor factory, Taiwan-based TSMC, could no longer produce semiconductors for the firm.This measure was \u201cdeliberately more targeted at Huawei\u2019s future ability to source hardware, particularly chips and things that would more affect 5G,\u201d said Ciaran Martin, who heads the National Cyber Security Center (NCSC), an arm of the British GCHQ spy agency. As a result, the center revised its earlier assessment that the security threat by Huawei could be mitigated. That paved the way for Tuesday\u2019s decision.In a blog post Tuesday, NCSC technical director Ian Levy said, \u201cWe think that Huawei products that are adapted to cope with the [Commerce rule] change are likely to suffer more security and reliability problems because of the massive engineering challenge ahead of them, and it will be harder for us to be confident in their use within our mitigation strategy.\u201dThe decision also was influenced by mounting pressure from the Conservative Party in Parliament. The 5G debate in Europe reflects a changed geopolitical reality, said Bob Seely, a Conservative lawmaker. \u201cThe relationship between the U.K. and China, and the world and China, and the United States and China, is fundamentally changing,\u201d he said. \u2018The government is now realizing that the China they want is not the China they\u2019re getting. \u201c\n\n", "comment": "0 Comments", "topic": "National Security"}, {"cover": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/PHAJWHT7DEI6VI7OCPQ24CRVOE.jpghttps://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/PHAJWHT7DEI6VI7OCPQ24CRVOE.jpg", "title": "Trump\u2019s nominee for senior Pentagon job in trouble heading into hearing", "date": "Jul 29, 2020", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/trumps-nominee-for-senior-pentagon-job-in-trouble-heading-into-hearing/2020/07/29/b2b2d65c-d104-11ea-af07-1d058ca137ae_story.html", "keyword": "China and Security", "website": "the Washington Post", "author": "Dan LamotheSeung Min Kim", "content": "President Trump\u2019s nomination of a retired Army general for a senior Pentagon position  appeared to be in trouble Wednesday, with Republicans and Democrats alike expressing concern about his partisan attacks, his comments about Islam, and infidelity.Support our journalism.

Tata, a military officer turned novelist and Fox News commentator, faces mounting opposition from Democrats on the Senate Armed Services Committee because of his past remarks, which include falsely calling former president Barack Obama a \u201cterrorist leader.\u201dThe contested nomination for undersecretary of defense for policy is emblematic of the Trump administration\u2019s difficulty in finding qualified nominees and getting them confirmed. It also highlights anew Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper\u2019s struggles to shield the Pentagon from partisanship while serving under a president who has repeatedly dragged the military into political battles.ADADThe influential position has been held on an acting basis since former undersecretary John C. Rood was swept out of the Pentagon in February, after he warned that the administration should not withhold military aid to Ukraine. That issue ended up at the center of Trump\u2019s impeachment and subsequent acquittal along party lines.Sen. James M. Inhofe (R-Okla.), the committee chairman, said in an interview that Trump has made it clear to him that he wants Tata to get a hearing, which is scheduled for Thursday morning. Inhofe, asked about Tata\u2019s past comments, acknowledged that a party-line confirmation vote is possible and aligned himself with Tata, who did not respond to interview requests.\u201cHe\u2019s not a real tactful person,\u201d Inhofe said. \u201cBut, of course, neither am I. Nor is the president.\u201dADJonathan Hoffman, the chief Pentagon spokesman, said in a statement Wednesday that the department is looking forward \u201cto General Tata having a chance to share his record of leadership and success in public service and his extensive national security experience with the Committee on Thursday.\u201dADBut it is not clear whether Tata has enough support among Republicans to be confirmed. His nomination could put those who are facing reelection in the difficult position of either facing the president\u2019s wrath or defending their vote.One Republican on the committee, Sen. Joni Ernst (Iowa) expressed doubts about Tata on Tuesday.\u201cYou know, I\u2019m still vetting him, but I can\u2019t say that I would be optimistic,\u201d she said in an interview.

Evans, a destroyer that collided with an Australian aircraft carrier in 1969, to the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington because the accident occurred in the South China Sea, outside the war zone.Tata, 60, served 28 years in the Army, retiring in 2009 after a career that included a stint as the deputy commanding general of the 10th Mountain Division during a deployment to Afghanistan. But his career ended after an Army inspector general investigation found that he had at least two extramarital affairs during his career, despite adultery being a crime in the military.ADAfter Trump nominated Tata in June, CNN surfaced tweets and comments he had made in interviews in which he denigrated Obama and other former senior U.S. officials in conspiratorial terms. ADTata at one point tweeted in 2018 that Islam was the \u201cmost oppressive violent religion I know of\u201d and said that Obama was a \u201cterrorist leader\u201d who did more to harm the United States and \u201chelp Islamic countries than any president in history.\u201dTata also at one point accused former CIA director John Brennan, without evidence, of attempting to order the killing of Trump through a tweet by quoting the Roman statesman Marcus Tullius Cicero.\u201cThis is a signal to someone, somewhere,\u201d Tata wrote. \u201cCicero was assassinated for political reasons. This is a clear threat against @POTUS.\u201dADAt another point in 2018, Tata tweeted at Brennan, telling him he should be prepared to \u201cpick his poison,\u201d including execution or just sucking \u201con a pistol,\u201d despite the U.S. government\u2019s long struggle to curb an epidemic of suicides among service members and veterans. He included the hashtag \u201c#treason.\u201dADTata apologized in a letter to senators, playing down the attacks as a \u201cfew misstatements\u201d made in 8,800 tweets. The remarks, he wrote, \u201cwhile grievous, are not indicative of who I  am.\u201dA former senior defense official, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue, said Wednesday that he does not think Tata can be confirmed unless Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) decides to push a vote through by invoking cloture, limiting debate about Tata.ADThe former official said it was notable that Sen. Jack Reed (R.I.), the committee\u2019s ranking Democrat, came out early against Tata\u2019s nomination, something he does not typically do. The White House, not the Pentagon, is driving Tata\u2019s nomination, and it is unclear whether McConnell will require Republican senators to make \u201cwalk-the-plank\u201d votes over Tata, the former official said.AD\u201cIt\u2019s kind of hard to see him as a serious person for a job where you have to negotiate and talk to allies about serious issues,\u201d the former official added.On Monday, two retired Army major generals who served with Tata defended him in an opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal. Clarence K.K. Chin and Dana J.H.

Although that possibility is off the table, the U.S. has announced a $12 million aid and development package for Greenland that DeHart will help shepherd, according to officials.Pompeo has spoken in the past about the Trump administration\u2019s determination to prevent Russia and China from playing a dominant role in the Arctic, which is heavily affected by climate change. Russia has expanded military bases in its Arctic regions, and China has sought to declare itself a \u201cnear-Arctic nation\u201d despite having no territory near the area.Environmentalists criticized Pompeo last year when he spoke at an Arctic Council event in Finland and said the U.S. and others should exploit changes, including sharp reductions in ocean ice, for economic benefit, including the opening of new sea lines and greater opportunities for energy and mineral extraction.ADADDeHart\u2019s appointment fills an empty slot in the department\u2019s senior ranks that had been created during the Obama administration but remained vacant since President Donald Trump took office and the previous coordinator, retired Coast Guard Adm. Robert Papp, stepped down.\u201cThe United States plays a critical leadership role on Arctic issues within the international community and remains committed to ensuring a peaceful region where U.S. interests are safeguarded, the U.S. homeland is protected, and Arctic states work cooperatively to address shared challenges,\u201d the State Department said in a statement.DeHart is 28-year foreign service officer and was most recently senior adviser for security negotiations and agreements. He had been leading discussions with South Korea over the continued presence of U.S. troops there. He has also served as the No. 2 diplomat in Norway, which has extensive Arctic interests.Copyright 2020 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Subscribe today.arrow-rightAs lawmakers drill down on the size and scope of tech companies at today's blockbuster antitrust hearing, the leaders of Amazon, Apple, Google and Facebook plan to focus on the positive contributions of their businesses during the pandemic, from creating jobs to keeping people connected. They'll also paint their companies as quintessentially American engines of innovation that do more to help small businesses than to harm them, according to documents my colleagues and I obtained.\u00a0Lawmakers and consumer advocates hope this will be a turning point that ushers in Silicon Valley regulation.\u00a0But that will be very challenging: Each company in today's hot seat before the House Judiciary antitrust subcommittee has a unique business model. And the ways lawmakers fear the companies could leverage their power to squash rivals and influence society are very distinct.\u00a0ADAD\u201cOne of the things that makes this hearing so complicated is they're not interchangeable,\u201d said Gigi Sohn, a distinguished fellow at the Georgetown Law Institute for Technology Law & Policy. Compared to other big events when lawmakers hauled in executives from other industries under scrutiny \u2013 such as tobacco or banking \u2013 the tech companies appearing today \u201call have different problems, though some of them overlap,\u201d Sohn said.\u00a0Not to mention the executives are appearing over video conference \u2013 a format that's not exactly conducive to made-for-TV moments despite it being a pivotal moment in lawmakers' year-long investigation into Big Tech.\u00a0Here's what you need to know:\u00a0Jeff Bezos will stress the extraordinarily competitive nature of the global retail market in his first-ever congressional appearance.\u00a0Why lawmakers are worried: The Amazon chief executive's e-commerce empire is massive. Lawmakers are sure to grill Bezos about whether the company has abused its position as a key sales platform to harness data from third-party sellers and give its own products a leg up. Amazon has denied engaging in such a practice, but Rep. David N. Cicilline (D-R.I.) has questioned this in light of news reports that appear to contradict previous assurances the company made to the panel.\u00a0ADADAmazon\u2019s argument: Bezos, who also owns The Washington Post, will tell a deeply personal yarn about his rise from being the son of a teen mom to building one of the largest companies in the world. He\u2019ll argue that the company\u2019s size has allowed it to create many jobs during a global pandemic, and support important social causes such as addressing climate change. His opening remarks, however, didn\u2019t indicate how he plans to respond to the accusations that the company siphons data from rivals for its own gain. He plans to note that most Americans have a favorable impression of Amazon, citing \u201cleading independent polls\u201d that he didn\u2019t identify, as my colleague Jay Greene reported.\u00a0\u201cAt Amazon, customer obsession has made us what we are, and allowed us to do ever greater things,\u201d Bezos wrote. (Read Amazon's testimony here.)Apple's Tim Cook will argue its App Store opened the \u201cgate wider\u201d for developers.Why lawmakers are worried: Companies ranging from Tinder to Microsoft have raised concerns that Apple's App Store is too powerful. They've complained about Apple policies that force companies to hand over a portion of the subscriptions and other purchases made through iPhone apps. Companies argue these policies have hurt them financially and left iPhone owners with higher bills. It has only intensified during the pandemic as more companies make their services virtual. Developers have also accused Apple of using its position to copy the best ideas, causing companies to buckle under pressure, Reed Albergotti reported.\u00a0ADADApple's defense: Cook will say the App Store is a \u201crevolutionary alternative\u201d to the options software developers had before it launched in 2008, compared to pushing physical products or scoring shelf space in a brick-and-mortar store with limited reach. He'll emphasize that Apple has never raised commissions or added fees since introducing the App Store. He'll also highlight the company's focus on privacy and security.\u00a0\u201cI share the subcommittee's belief that competition is a great virtue, that it promotes innovation, that it makes space for the next great idea and that it gives consumers more choices,\u201d Cook is expected to say. (Read Apple's testimony here.)Mark Zuckerberg will focus on how Facebook is bringing people together during the pandemic.\u00a0Why lawmakers are worried: Facebook is staring down a host of political controversies in Washington, but the crux of the competition concerns revolve around how it reportedly siphons data about competing social media start-ups to imitate or snap up their services. My colleague Elizabeth Dwoskin previously outlined that strategy, which hinged on an app called Onavo. The company used it to glean insights about what customers were doing when they weren't on Facebook or other services the company owns, such as Instagram. That allowed Facebook to spot other competitors on the rise. However, the app created major data privacy concerns, and Facebook ultimately shut down the service last year.\u00a0ADADFacebook's argument: Zuckerberg will try to emphasize the fleeting nature of success in Silicon Valley, noting that when he moved the company to the former campus of Sun Microsystems, he left the old company's sign up as a reminder to employees to stay hungry. \u201cFacebook is a successful company now, but we got there the American way: we started with nothing and provided better products that people find valuable,\u201d Zuckerberg will say. \u201cAs I understand our laws, companies aren\u2019t bad just because they are big.\u201d\u00a0Zuckerberg will also stress how his business is even more critical during stay-at-home orders: He'll note that people use his services to stay in touch with family and friends and get the latest information from public officials about the pandemic. He'll tout new products the company has built in response to the coronavirus crisis. (Read Facebook's testimony here.)Alphabet chief executive Sundar Pichai will emphasize free services such as search and maps benefit consumers.Why lawmakers are worried: Critics say Google is dominant in search and advertising, and that can harm a range of competitors, from news outlets to travel companies. Google could imminently face antitrust scrutiny in the United States, as Tony Romm reported that the Justice Department and state attorneys general could file charges against the company as soon as this summer. European regulators have fined the search giant billions over concerns that its advertising practices break antitrust laws, and they've signaled more action is coming.\u00a0ADADGoogle's take: Pichai, who is chief executive of Google and its parent company, will argue that the company plays an essential role in expanding access to greater economic opportunity through technology. Pichai will speak about his own experience having regular Internet access for the first time as a graduate student in the United States, and he'll particularly highlight how the company's products are being used by educators during the pandemic. He'll also speak about the major investments the company makes in research and development in the United States.\u00a0\u201cTo this day, I haven\u2019t forgotten how access to innovation and technology altered the course of my life,\u201d Pichai plans to say. \u201cGoogle aims to build products that increase access to opportunity for everyone \u2014 no matter where you live, what you believe, or how much money you earn.\u201d (Read Google's testimony here.)The tech giants\u2019 rivals are not exactly quiet today.\u00a0One of the revolutionary aspects of the congressional investigation has been other competitors\u2019 willingness to speak out about the giants, a sea change in Silicon Valley.\u00a0ADADToday, TikTok jumped on the bandwagon: As Zuckerberg is expected to warn that lawmakers need to be wary of the threat of competition from Chinese tech companies as they weigh tech regulation, TikTok's chief executive Kevin Mayer called out Facebook for launching a \u201ccopycat product\u201d which lets people create short videos similar to those on TikTok.Mayer said the company welcomes competition: \u201cFacebook is even launching another copycat product, Reels (tied to Instagram), after their other copycat Lasso failed quickly,\u201d he said. \u201cBut let's focus our energies on fair and open competition in service of our consumers, rather than maligning attacks by our competitor \u2014 namely Facebook \u2014 disguised as patriotism and designed to put an end to our very presence in the U.S.\" Beijing-based ByteDance owns TikTok.\u00a0Correction: TikTok's chief executive is Kevin Mayer. A previous version incorrectly listed his last name.ADADProgramming note: The Washington Post\u2019s Libby Casey will anchor a special report around the judiciary committee hearing on Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google.\u00a0 Casey will be joined by reporters Elizabeth Dwoskin, Tony Romm and me for analysis on how this event may affect consumers, the economy and legislation. Tune in here.\u00a0Our top tabsGoogle rejected an anti-Trump ad showing clips of police violence against protesters.Hulu and Verizon also rejected the campaign, which was sponsored by the liberal groups Priorities USA and Color of Change PAC, Isaac Stanley-Becker reports. The 30-second ad shows clips of police officers beating protesters set against a recent Trump speech where he calls himself a \u201cpresident of law and order.\u201dADGoogle maintained it blocked the graphic ad to prevent harm to users.\u00a0AD\u201cWe don\u2019t allow advertisers to run ads that contain graphic violence, including depictions of blood, baton beatings, and other instances of physical trauma,\u201d said Charlotte Smith, a spokeswoman for the company. \u201cThese policies apply to all advertisers, regardless of political affiliation.\u201d Hulu and Verizon expressed similar reasons for rejecting the ad to Priorities USA. Facebook ran the ad.The groups say the content moderation decision highlights an ongoing double standard for the Trump campaign.\u201cThe decision by Google and other online platforms to censor our ads while allowing Trump to use violence in his own ads only exacerbates the problem and prevents our elected officials from being held accountable for their dangerous actions,\u201d Priorities USA Deputy Executive Director Jenn Stowe said.Twitter suspended Donald Trump Jr. for 12 hours after he tweeted coronavirus misinformation.The suspension underlines the tough stance the platform has taken against medical misinformation during the pandemic, Rachel Lerman, Katie Shepherd and Taylor Telford report. But it also renewed accusations of bias against conservatives at a time when the Trump administration is pushing regulators to reevaluate legal protections for social media companies.The restriction was \u201cfurther proof that Big Tech is intent on killing free expression online and is another instance of them committing election interference to stifle Republican voices,\u201d Donald Trump Jr.'s spokesman Andy Surabian said. Tech companies have repeatedly denied that they're biased against conservatives.\u00a0The video shared by Trump shows a news conference of a group of doctors claiming without evidence that hydroxychloroquine could cure and treat the virus. Twitter removed videos of the news conference, deleting several of the tweets that President Trump shared in the process. Medical experts say there is not enough evidence to prove that hydroxychloroquine, a drug used to treat malaria, helps covid-19 patients recover, and it carries deadly side effects, particularly taken without a doctor's order.\u00a0The president also praised the viral social media video in a news conference with reporters yesterday.\u00a0A federal judge ruled that New York must start paying Uber and Lyft drivers unemployment benefits.The ruling gives legal weight to drivers in an ongoing battle with ride-hailing companies over their worker classification, Noam Scheiber at the New York Times reports.The New York Taxi Workers Alliance brought the lawsuit in May, alleging that the state was taking weeks and even months longer to pay unemployed ride-hailing drivers than other unemployed employees. The lawsuit alleged the delay was due at least in part to the state's failure to require Uber and Lyft to submit lost earnings data. \u00a0The ruling noted that in 294 cases where the state found Uber to be an employer, Uber appealed 227. Uber abandoned 200 of the appeals, but the state accused both Uber and Lyft of intentionally trying to evade sharing earnings data. \u00a0ber and Lyft denied the allegations.Both Uber and Lyft are facing lawsuits in Massachusetts and California claiming the companies are misclassifying workers as independent contractors.\u00a0Rant and raveCES, the world's largest tech trade show, is officially going virtual next year.

Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), acting chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, asked the Department of Homeland Security and the FBI to assess the threat posed by the video app, Alexandra Alper at Reuters reports.\u00a0\u201cWe are greatly concerned that the (Chinese Communist Party) could use its control over TikTok to distort or manipulate (political) conversations to sow discord among Americans and to achieve its preferred political outcomes,\u201d the lawmakers wrote.\u00a0TikTok has come under fierce criticism in D.C. over its ownership by Chinese parent company ByteDance. Trump has threatened to ban the app over concerns that it could be used by China for spying.TikTok has repeatedly denied imposing Chinese censorship laws in the United States. The company also says it has not and would not share any U.S. user data with Beijing.\u00a0\"TikTok isn't the go-to app to follow political news or candidates, but we're taking cues from the experience of our peers during the last US presidential election and proactively investing to safeguard our app,\" TikTok spokeswoman Jamie Favazza said. TikTok already has a strict policy against disinformation, and we don't accept political ads. Our content and moderation policies are led by our US-based team in California and aren't influenced by any foreign government.\"Democrats are pushing for data privacy provisions for coronavirus response data in the next relief bill.A group of a dozen Democratic senators and one independent wrote to Senate leadership yesterday urging them to include legislation that would put guardrails protecting data collected for covid-19 from being used for non-public health reasons. They argue that a failure to build public trust in data collection efforts will undermine the government's coronavirus response.The next relief bill could pass as early as this week.Rite Aid quietly rolled out inaccurate facial recognition to 200 stores in the United States. \u00a0The technology was deployed in largely lower-income and nonwhite neighborhoods, Jeffrey Dastin at Reuters found. The retailer's expansive program, which it has since discontinued, highlights the dangers of the largely unregulated use of facial recognition technology in the United States.\u00a0Government studies have shown that facial recognition software is less effective on darker skin tones. Ten current and former Rite Aid employees who worked on the loss-prevention program said that one of the systems it used from company FaceFirst routinely misidentified people, especially shoppers of color. FaceFirst denied Reuters's findings. \u00a0Rite Aid told Reuters earlier this year that signs warned customers of the technology, but reporters found no such notice in more than a third of the 75 stores they visited.TrendingMacKenzie Scott, formerly Bezos, says she has given away $1.7 billion of her wealth so far (CNN)AMC, Universal Agree to Trim Theatrical Window Before Movies Go Online (The Wall Street Journal)DaybookApple, Google, Amazon and Facebook will all release their quarterly earnings tomorrow.RightsCon will take place online on July 27-31.Before you log off", "comment": "0 Comments", "topic": "PowerPost"}, {"cover": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/BKSMTLGNBAI6VGNQQQTOE3JAHM.jpghttps://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/BKSMTLGNBAI6VGNQQQTOE3JAHM.jpg", "title": "Here are 15 of the week\u2019s best photos", "date": "Jul 24, 2020", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/photography/2020/07/24/here-are-15-weeks-best-photos/", "keyword": "China and Security", "website": "the Washington Post", "author": "", "content": "", "comment": "", "topic": ""}, {"cover": "", "title": "US accuses Russia of testing anti-satellite weapon in space", "date": "Jul 23, 2020", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/us-accuses-russia-of-testing-anti-satellite-weapon-in-space/2020/07/23/85cfd89a-cd19-11ea-99b0-8426e26d203b_story.html", "keyword": "China and Security", "website": "the Washington Post", "author": "", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The United States accused Russia on Thursday of conducting a test of an anti-satellite weapon in space, asserting that it exposed Moscow\u2019s intent to deploy weapons that threaten U.S. and allied satellites.Support our journalism.

John W. Raymond, commander of Space Command and the head of U.S. Space Force.AD\u201cThis is further evidence of Russia\u2019s continuing efforts to develop and test space-based systems, and consistent with the Kremlin\u2019s published military doctrine to employ weapons that hold U.S. and allied space assets at risk.\u201dIn a space strategy document published last month, the Pentagon asserted that \u201cChina and Russia present the greatest strategic threat due to their development, testing, and deployment of counterspace capabilities and their associated military doctrine for employment in conflict extending to space.\u201dADIt added, \u201cChina and Russia each have weaponized space as a means to reduce U.S. and allied military effectiveness and challenge our freedom of operation in space.\u201dPrivate U.S. space analysts said U.S. concerns about the July 15 event appear justified in an era of rapidly improving space technologies that could pose threats to satellites that are integral to modern life in the U.S. and globally. Defense of these satellites was a key reason the Trump administration create U.S. Space Force last December.ADIn a separate statement, the head of the British government\u2019s space directorate, Air Vice-Marshal Harvey Smyth, echoed the American assertion about the July 15 event. He wrote on Twitter that the Russians had launched a projectile \u201cwith the characteristics of a weapon.\u201dAD\u201cWe call on Russia to avoid any further such testing,\u201d Smyth wrote. \u201cWe also urge Russia to continue to work constructively with the U.K. and other partners to encourage responsible behavior in space.\u201dThe State Department\u2019s top arms control official, Christopher Ford, said the event exposed Russia\u2019s \u201chypocritical advocacy\u201d of outer space arms control, \u201cwith which Moscow aims to restrict the capabilities of the United States while clearly having no intention of halting its own counterspace program \u2014 both ground-based anti-satellite capabilities and what would appear to be actual in-orbit anti-satellite weaponry.\u201dADSpace Command said that on July 15 a Russian satellite, designated Cosmos 2543, \u201coperated in abnormally close proximity to a U.S. government satellite in low-earth orbit before it maneuvered away and over to another Russian satellite, where it released another object in proximity to the Russia target satellite. This test is inconsistent with the intended purpose of the satellite as an inspector system, as described by Russia.\u201dADBrian Weeden, a space policy expert at the Secure World Foundation, which advocates for peaceful uses of outer space, said in an interview that the U.S. and British concerns are justified.\u201cI think they\u2019re on to something,\u201d he said. \u201dI, too, found this event very suspicious.\u201dWeeden said an object separated from Cosmos 2543 at a speed of perhaps more than 400 miles per hour.AD\u201cThat is unusual \u2014 very unusual,\u201d Weeden said. \u201cAnd it is very similar to an incident back in 2017 where another Russian satellite deployed a small object at high speed as well.\u201dHenry Hertzfeld, director of the Space Policy Institute at George Washington University, said the July 15 incident points up the fact that rapid advances in space technology require vigilance by U.S. defense agencies, particularly in light of worsening U.S. relations with Russia and China.AD\u201cSo should be we concerned?

Quite simply, it\u2019s a new day for the United States and Greenland.\u201dHe talked up the overtures the Trump administration has made toward Denmark\u2019s autonomous territories.Last month, the United States opened its first consulate in Greenland since 1953. \u201cReopening the U.S. Consulate in Nuuk reinvigorates an American presence that was dormant for far too long,\u201d Pompeo said.ADHe also referenced the U.S. offer of a $12.1 million economic development package for Greenland.And he added that the United States and Faroe Islands had \u201cagreed to start a formal dialogue to talk about key issues like healthy fisheries and enhanced commercial engagement.\u201dADThe U.S. ambassador to Denmark, Carla Sands, has met with Faroe Islands officials to discuss opening a consulate there and the possibility of using harbors to support U.S. naval operations in the Arctic, according to Faroese media.In March, Sands offered unspecified support to the Faroe Islands foreign minister to combat the novel coronavirus. When the offer became the subject of news reports in April, it prompted widespread criticism from Danish lawmakers, who noted that the Faroe Islands were doing better than the United States during the pandemic.ADDenmark, too, has had success controlling the coronavirus pandemic. On Wednesday, upon his arrival at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Pompeo went to shake hands with the Danish foreign minister, who didn\u2019t offer his hand back. Pompeo extended his hand to the Faroese foreign minister, who also would not shake hands. Pompeo then elbow bumped with the Greenlandic foreign minister before entering the building.ADThe broader theme of Pompeo\u2019s trip, which first involved a stop in London, has been to encourage allies to stand with the United States against China.\u201cThe U.S. wants Denmark and its autonomous territories to understand that China is more than just business, it\u2019s geopolitics,\u201d Sten Rynning, professor of international politics at the University of Southern Denmark, told The Washington Post.AD\u201cThe reason Denmark is an important recipient of this message is because Greenland is so strategic. The U.S. does not want to let China have a free pass into the Arctic realm,\u201d he said.China, which defines itself as a \u201cnear-Arctic nation\u201d \u2014 despite Beijing being almost 1,800 miles from the Arctic Circle \u2014 has invested heavily in Greenland\u2019s infrastructure and its fishing and mining industry in recent years.AD\u201cMany decision-makers in Nuuk are warmly welcoming the increase in U.S. interest,\u201d Martin Breum, an expert on Arctic affairs, told The  Post. \u201cBut Greenland sells fish and shrimps for more than $230 million dollars every year to China.

Martin Luther King Jr. appealed to the ideals of the American founding. He declared, \u201cWhen the architects of our republic wrote the magnificent words of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence, they were signing a promissory note to which every American was to fall heir.\u201d Our founders made a \u201cpromise that all men, yes, black men as well as white men, would be guaranteed the \u2018unalienable Rights\u2019 of \u2018Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.\u2019 \u201d He had come to Washington, he said, \u201cto cash \u2026 a check that will give us upon demand the riches of freedom and the security of justice\u201d so that \u201cone day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: \u2018We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal.\u2019 \u201dLewis, the youngest speaker at the March on Washington, echoed King\u2019s sentiments in his address that day. \u201cI appeal to all of you to get into this great revolution that is sweeping this nation,\u201d he said. \u201cGet in and stay in the streets of every city, every village and hamlet of this nation until true freedom comes, until the revolution of 1776 is complete. We must \u2026 complete the revolution.\u201dADADThey saw the fight for civil rights not as a rejection of the American founding but as the necessary next step for its fulfillment and completion. They did not simply argue that racism was unfair; they argued that racism was un-American.That is a message King kept preaching until his last moments on earth. In a speech the night before he was killed, King appealed to our founding principles, and argued that it was Bull Conner who was violating them. \u201cIf I lived in China or even Russia, or any totalitarian country, maybe I could understand some of these illegal injunctions,\u201d King said. \u201cMaybe I could understand the denial of certain basic First Amendment privileges, because they hadn\u2019t committed themselves to that over there.

Instead, it has spurred investigations around the world into deal-making, election spending and political patronage under former Prime Minister Najib Razak. The figures are mind-boggling: Of the $8 billion that 1MDB raised via bond sales, the U.S. alleges more than half was siphoned off. Angry voters ousted Najib in a 2018 election that ended his party\u2019s 61 years of rule, and two years later he was convicted in the first of a series of trials. U.S. prosecutors have implicated at least three senior bankers from Goldman Sachs Group Inc., one of whom admitted to bribery. Malaysia, which had filed its own charges, reached a $3.9 billion settlement with the bank.Support our journalism. Subscribe today.arrow-right1. What is 1MDB?ADADIt\u2019s a government investment company -- full name, 1Malaysia Development Bhd -- that took shape in 2009 under Najib, who led its advisory board. Its early initiatives included buying privately owned power plants and planning a new financial district in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia\u2019s capital. The fund proved better at borrowing -- it accumulated $12 billion in debt -- than at luring large-scale foreign investment.2. What\u2019s the issue?Much of the money raised was allegedly embezzled. The U.S. Justice Department says more than $4.5 billion flowed from the fund through fraudulent shell companies to corrupt officials and their associates. According to the U.S. indictment, a small coterie of Malaysians, led by businessman Low Taek Jho (known as Jho Low), diverted money from 1MDB into personal accounts disguised to look like legitimate businesses, and kicked back some of those funds to officials. There were questions about a $681 million payment that landed in Najib\u2019s personal bank account (he has said most of the money was returned). Malaysia\u2019s then-attorney general cleared Najib of wrongdoing in 2016. But after losing office, Najib was charged with corruption, breach of trust and money laundering. The first trial involved $10 million deposited in his personal accounts from a former 1MDB unit. He was found guilty July 28 on all seven counts and sentenced to 12 years; his lawyer promised to appeal. Jho Low, a fugitive, has also denied any wrongdoing.ADAD3. Where\u2019s the money?Scattered, but slowly coming in. Under the July 24 settlement, Malaysia will drop all criminal charges against Goldman in exchange for a $2.5 billion cash payment and at least $1.4 billion from seized 1MDB assets being returned with the help of U.S. prosecutors and Goldman. (Goldman made $593 million working on three bond sales that raised $6.5 billion for 1MDB in 2012 and 2013 -- far more than what banks typically make from such deals.) An agreement to settle the U.S. charges with a possible $2 billion penalty was said to be awaiting a Justice Department decision on whether Goldman would have to accept its first-ever guilty plea. In addition:\u2022 U.S. prosecutors struck a deal in October with Jho Low to recoup almost $700 million worth of assets, including a Beverly Hills hotel and real estate in New York and London. That\u2019s in addition to $260 million of assets, including a $126 million super yacht, seized earlier on Malaysia\u2019s behalf.ADAD\u2022 The U.S. reached a $60 million settlement with the producers of \u201cThe Wolf of Wall Street,\u201d a 2013 movie allegedly funded with siphoned money. The production company was co-founded by Riza Aziz, Najib\u2019s stepson and a friend of Jho Low.\u2022 Malaysia is moving to seize $340 million in PetroSaudi International\u2019s accounts in London.\u2022 Singapore is returning S$35 million ($25 million) forfeited by former Goldman banker Roger Ng.4. Who\u2019s investigating?The U.S. Justice Department has been at the forefront of 1MDB investigations, focusing on bribery, theft and money laundering. According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, some potential witnesses were scared to talk because they feared retaliation. Several other countries also conducted probes. Singapore and Switzerland have fined some banks for lapses in anti-money laundering controls. Malaysia also has said it is looking into allegations that China offered to help fend off probes into 1MDB in the U.S. and elsewhere in exchange for stakes in infrastructure projects in Malaysia. A former Najib aide testified that the ex-premier offered projects to China in return for help resolving 1MDB\u2019s debt.ADAD5. Who else is charged?\u2022 Jho Low, a bon vivant who said he did consulting work for 1MDB, is portrayed by U.S. prosecutors as the central figure who set up shell companies to collect proceeds from the fund and arranged withdrawals for payoffs and for his own lavish spending. He has been charged in absentia in Malaysia and the U.S. with money laundering and other offenses. Malaysian police have bemoaned the lack of help from other jurisdictions in finding him, after saying they had located him and were in talks with a party they suspect of protecting him. Jho Low\u2019s settlement with the U.S. didn\u2019t include an admission of guilt or release him from criminal charges.\u2022 Goldman\u2019s former Southeast Asia Chairman Tim Leissner pleaded guilty to U.S. charges including conspiracy to launder money and admitted to bribing officials in Malaysia and the United Arab Emirates to get bond deals for Goldman. He agreed to forfeit $43.7 million and was scheduled to be sentenced on Jan. 22, 2021.ADAD\u2022 Ng was extradited from Malaysia to the U.S. to face similar charges. His trial start date was postponed until January 2021 by the coronavirus outbreak. (The U.S. Federal Reserve has banned both men from the financial industry.)\u2022 Malaysia leveled charges of securities law violations against Leissner, Ng, Jho Low and 1MDB\u2019s former general counsel, Jasmine Loo Ai Swan.\u2022 PetroSaudi International directors Tarek Obaid and Patrick Mahony were charged by Malaysia in absentia in 2020 for allegedly receiving $300 million from 1MDB through unlawful activity. In 2018, Swiss federal prosecutors opened proceedings to investigate two officials of the Saudi oil producer, without confirming their identities.AD\u2022 Ex-1MDB President Arul Kanda was charged along with Najib for allegedly tampering with a state audit report into the fund. Both men have denied wrongdoing.AD\u2022 Rosmah Mansor, Najib\u2019s wife, was charged with money laundering and tax evasion. Luxury items and cash seized from properties linked to the former first couple were valued at about 1.1 billion ringgit ($259 million). According to U.S. prosecutors, Jho Low in 2013 allegedly funneled $27.3 million that was looted from 1MDB to a New York jeweler who designed a pink diamond necklace for her.6. What\u2019s still brewing?The U.S. investigation, and whether it will force Goldman to take a guilty plea, is one of the biggest issues remaining. Prosecutors assert that beyond Leissner, some employees at Goldman knew about a bribery scheme but worked to hide it from the firm\u2019s compliance and legal departments. Singapore was said to have expanded a criminal probe to include Goldman; two Abu Dhabi funds have filed a civil suit against Goldman in New York seeking damages for alleged fraud in connection with embezzlement at 1MDB; and a Justice Department employee has pleaded guilty to funneling money into the U.S. to pay for a lobbying effort to influence the 1MDB probe, with the filing identifying the fund\u2019s source as Jho Low. In another twist, the U.S. was said to be investigating Deutsche Bank AG over a former Goldman executive who joined the German bank.ADAD7. Exactly how much money is involved?In all, 1MDB raised more than $8 billion in bond sales and accumulated billions more in debt through loans and interest payments. Swiss investigators say about $7 billion of 1MDB funds passed into the global financial system from 2009 to 2015. They\u2019re still assessing how much was misappropriated; the U.S. estimates more than half. Some 1MDB projects are going ahead under the new government, including the plan for a new financial district and a $34 billion property and transport hub. As for 1MDB, it has been reduced to a shell after the finance ministry took over its assets and debt.8. Why does it matter?Authorities in Asia, the U.S. and Europe have been working to coordinate their investigations into the money trail from 1MDB, as well as legal approaches toward Goldman and asset recovery. Their findings could potentially identify, and help close, loopholes in the global financial system that open the way for corruption.ADAD9. Who else is involved?\u2022 The Fed banned ex-Goldman banker Andrea Vella from the financial industry for life, saying the former co-head of investment banking in Asia engaged in \u201cunsafe and unsound practices\u201d by failing to ensure all of Goldman\u2019s internal committees were aware that the 1MDB bond deals involved Jho Low.\u2022 Switzerland\u2019s Office of the Attorney-General continues to investigate six people on suspicion of criminal mismanagement, bribery and money laundering related to the case. The top Swiss prosecutors have also opened criminal proceedings against two Swiss banks, Falcon Private Bank Ltd. and BSI SA, for \u201corganizational deficiencies that may have permitted the commission of offenses currently being investigated.\u201d\u2022 Zurich-based Falcon, linked to $3.8 billion of 1MDB fund flows, was ordered to cease operations in Singapore, and Switzerland has threatened to withdraw its license if there were any further breaches of money-laundering regulations.\u2022 Switzerland\u2019s financial regulator said it would review JPMorgan Chase & Co.\u2019s anti-money laundering controls after finding the bank seriously breached regulations in its dealings with 1MDB.\u2022 BSI lost its license to do business in Singapore for breaches of money laundering rules.\u2022 Malaysia central bank governor Muhammad Ibrahim resigned in 2018 amid questions over the role the monetary authority played in a land-purchase deal linked to 1MDB. The monetary authority set up a review of the deal.\u2022 UBS Group, DBS Group, Credit Suisse, United Overseas Bank and Standard Chartered are among those that have drawn penalties from the Singapore central bank for anti-money laundering lapses. They said they will strengthen controls in their businesses.\u2022 Singapore has banned at least eight financial professionals in connection with 1MDB.\u2022 Singapore authorities have interviewed Tan Boon-Kee, Deutsche Bank\u2019s former Asia Pacific head of financial institutions group, about the extent of her involvement with the 1MDB account.

Subscribe today.arrow-rightAskarov, a member of the ethnic Uzbek minority in Kyrgyzstan, was 69 years old. Before he was jailed, he documented and reported on police abuse of detainees and prison conditions in his hometown of Bazar-Korgon, in southern Kyrgyzstan. He was also a journalist, a talented artist, a husband, father and grandfather.ADADAskarov maintained his innocence to the day he died.Police arrested Askarov in June 2010 in connection with the killing of a police officer in Bazar-Korgon, a few days after ethnic violence \u2014 which disproportionately affected ethnic Uzbeks \u2014 left hundreds dead and thousands displaced in southern Kyrgyzstan. They tortured him in custody. During his trial, mobs violently attacked his lawyer and co-defendants. He didn\u2019t get a fair trial, but courts sentenced him to life in prison anyway. Despite the credibility of his torture claims, the authorities refused even to investigate, much less hold anyone accountable. His health deteriorated significantly during his time in prison.The U.N. Human Rights Committee found in 2016 that Askarov had been arbitrarily arrested, tortured and denied a fair trial. But for the past four years, Kyrgyz authorities played games with the committee\u2019s decision, flouting their international human rights obligations to abide by it. They failed either to acknowledge their wrongdoing, or to do the right thing and release Askarov, perhaps fearing a backlash from extreme Kyrgyz nationalists. Such cowardice meant that they let the conditions of his imprisonment take their toll on his health and chances of survival.ADADEven after the first cases of covid-19 were registered in Kyrgyzstan this year, and despite the surge in covid-19 and potentially related pneumonia cases in recent weeks, officials refused to release Askarov on humanitarian grounds. They even refused to take steps to protect Askarov from the increased risks he faced in custody, cynically claiming that Askarov was in fine health until the day before he died. They said so even though he was so weak he couldn\u2019t walk. And yet because of the pandemic, Askarov\u2019s wife could not visit him in the months before his death.Over the years that Human Rights Watch has advocated for Askarov\u2019s release, Kyrgyz officials we met with became increasingly exasperated when we raised his case and pressed them to release him.Then they just let him die.ADKyrgyz officials are sorely mistaken if they think Askarov\u2019s death means we can all now move on. We can\u2019t. Askarov died at their hands.ADAskarov will never get to travel to Uzbekistan to meet his grandchildren, or study art under great masters in China, or paint another portrait. These are all things he wanted to do if he was granted his freedom, he told me in a recent interview. Askarov\u2019s widow, Khadicha Askarova, who has fought tirelessly for Askarov for the past decade, will never get to embrace her husband again.But for all of us who care about human rights and rule of law in Kyrgyzstan, it\u2019s imperative that we continue to speak Askarov\u2019s name and demand accountability for his wrongful imprisonment and death.ADKyrgyzstan\u2019s diplomatic partners should keep this on their agenda with the government. The European Union is poised to sign an Enhanced Partnership and Co-operation Agreement with Kyrgyzstan later this year, and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, among others, provides Kyrgyzstan with assistance, including in the area of criminal justice reform. These institutions are especially well placed to use their political and financial engagement to push for accountability on such a fundamental human rights and rule of law issue.ADAskarov\u2019s death should ring in the ears of every Kyrgyz official until Kyrgyzstan completes an effective independent investigation into his death, takes action against those responsible for it and provides compensation to his next of kin, as is required by their human rights obligations when there is such a death in custody.It\u2019s time for Kyrgyz officials to answer for this cruel and needless death.Read more:The Post\u2019s View: This World Press Freedom Day, remember the journalists jailed or killed for doing their jobsJason Rezaian: The pandemic is a hard enough story for journalists to cover.

In each case, the party suffered a tremendous defeat within four years of assuming power, giving Republicans control of at least one congressional chamber or the presidency.Prudent heads would counsel caution in the fall, especially since former vice president Joe Biden\u2019s main appeal is that he is not President Trump. The surveys that show Biden with large leads both nationally and in the swing states are accurate, but those leads are built on the votes of millions of mainly college-educated suburban white voters who just a few years ago eagerly voted for Mitt Romney and Republican officeholders up and down the ballot. There\u2019s nothing in those data to suggest these people have suddenly discovered their inner socialist or are prepared to make serious personal sacrifices to advance the left\u2019s agenda. Yet that is exactly what the draft platform would have them do.ADADClimate change policy is an obvious place to start. Polls show that fighting climate change has become a top priority for Democrats, especially liberal ones. Yet polls also show that voters generally support modest measures that don\u2019t cost them much in the short term. Election results from a Democratic bastion, Washington state, back this up. Even though the state has not voted for a Republican for president since 1984 or governor since 1980, voters opposed two initiatives in 2016 and 2018 that would have imposed a modest carbon tax to combat climate change. The vote wasn\u2019t close in either election, with opposition to carbon taxes winning by 19 and 13 points. If habitual suburban Democrats and independents outside liberal Seattle don\u2019t like aggressive climate change policies, you can imagine what new Democratic voters outside Houston, Dallas and Atlanta think.Sign up for The Odds newsletter for election updates from data columnist David BylerDespite that, the platform and a separate climate action plan proposed by Biden pushes forward. Biden\u2019s plan says he will spend $2 trillion over four years to combat climate change. That\u2019s $500 billion a year \u2014 more than the budget for any government program before the coronavirus pandemic except Social Security, national defense and Medicare. That\u2019s an incredible amount of money that will spark fears about either unsustainable debt, an increase in taxes or both. It\u2019s hard to imagine that the upper-income suburban voters whose support undergirds Democratic chances will stand for that over time.Race policies are another place where Democrats risk jumping the shark. Americans are concerned about race relations and generally support reforms that will improve the lives of black Americans, especially in their interactions with police. They resolutely oppose reparations for slavery, on the other hand. Progressive political scientist Ruy Teixeira noted this recently, saying that white seniors \u2014 who, as a group, have been trending toward Biden in the wake of covid-19 \u2014  overwhelmingly oppose reparations. Yet the party\u2019s draft platform states it supports creating a commission to study slavery reparations.ADADDefense policy is another example of prospective overreach. Many people believe the Defense Department wastes money; the draft platform echoes that sentiment and says that Democrats can provide more defense for less. Centrists may initially support this, but only if U.S. security remains strong. The increasingly aggressive global postures from China and Russia means this era could be a repeat of the late 1970s, when post-Vietnam fatigue inspired defense cuts that quickly became unpopular as the Soviets exploited U.S. weaknesses around the world. This was a major reason in Ronald Reagan\u2019s rise, and remained a significant factor in the migration of blue-collar \u201cReagan Democrats\u201d to the GOP for years to come.Platforms and policy papers often come and go without much effect. But Biden\u2019s campaign has been consistently signaling a strong leftward turn across the board since he effectively clinched the nomination in April. Biden wants to unify the Democratic coalition, but he is forgetting that the centrist voters he\u2019s attracting don\u2019t have institutional representation in party councils. If Democrats do sweep to power in the landslide polls currently project and Biden governs like he\u2019s now talking, they might find their victory to be fleeting.Read more:Hugh Hewitt: Trump will run on his handling of the coronavirus and ChinaJennifer Rubin: Biden has learned how to give a presidential speechRahm Emanuel: Will the news media make the same mistake this election?Podcast | Joe Biden\u2019s potential running mates, in their own words", "comment": "140 Comments", "topic": "Opinions"}, {"cover": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/5I3YDEWREUI6VATLZQ4U3ASOGU.jpghttps://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/5I3YDEWREUI6VATLZQ4U3ASOGU.jpg", "title": "Trump says he has not spoken to Putin about alleged Russian bounties on U.S. troops", "date": "Jul 29, 2020", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-says-he-has-not-spoken-to-putin-about-alleged-russian-bounties-on-us-troops/2020/07/29/c8037944-d186-11ea-8c55-61e7fa5e82ab_story.html", "keyword": "China and Security", "website": "the Washington Post", "author": "John Wagner", "content": "President Trump said in an interview broadcast Wednesday that he has not spoken to Russian President Vladimir Putin about U.S. intelligence reports of Russian bounties given to Taliban-linked militants to kill U.S. and coalition forces in Afghanistan.Support our journalism.

But some of Trump\u2019s own senior intelligence officials viewed the information as credible enough to warn the Pentagon and allies so they could ensure they had measures in place to protect their forces in Afghanistan and to begin developing options for responding to such a Russian operation, national security adviser Robert C.

Robert P. Casey Jr. (D-Pa.) said in a tweet Wednesday.ADADEarlier, Andrew Bates, a spokesman for Democrat Joe Biden\u2019s presidential campaign, said that not confronting Putin on the intelligence was part of \u201can indefensible pattern of Donald Trump weakening the United States in the world in a manner that no American president ever has before, and it\u2019s absolutely despicable.\u201dSpeaking to reporters Wednesday as he left the White House on a trip to Texas, Trump said he would be \u201cvery angry\u201d if Russia had ordered bounties.\u201cSo I don\u2019t know why they\u2019d be doing it, but if you tell me they\u2019re doing it, I will certainly take that under consideration,\u201d he said. \u201cI would respond appropriately.\u201dTrump insisted that \u201cnobody\u2019s been tougher on Russia\u201d than him.ADDuring the Axios interview, Trump stressed that he was not orally briefed on the intelligence about possible Russian bounties.AD\u201cIt never reached my desk,\u201d he said. \u201cYou know why? . . .

Subscribe today.arrow-rightPrivacy concerns have been the most viral aspect of the popular short-video social network in the past week. On July 7, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the U.S. was considering banning TikTok, and warned it puts \u201cyour private information in the hands of the Chinese Communist Party.\u201d On July 10, the Democratic National Committee cautioned staffers about using it. (The same day, Amazon also told employees to stop using the TikTok app on work phones \u2014 but later said that order was sent in error. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)ADThe alarm even rang among TikTok\u2019s target demographic: Gaming superstar Tyler \u201cNinja\u201d Blevins tweeted on July 9 that he\u2019s deleting the TikTok app.Why the fuss? TikTok is owned by a Beijing-based company called ByteDance and has fallen in the crosshairs of a global technology battle. It\u2019s not just playing out in the U.S.: Last month, India banned TikTok and several apps from China, citing security concerns. Personal technology and geopolitics are becoming increasingly intertwined: Last summer, there was a similar privacy freakout over the Russian-made FaceApp, a program that takes photos of people and \u201cages\u201d them using artificial intelligence.ADAdvising everyone to just delete TikTok out of caution isn\u2019t so simple \u2014 it has been downloaded more than 2 billion times, and millions of young Americans are relying on it for connection during the coronavirus pandemic. TikTok is the 2020 equivalent of \u201cStar Search\u201d crossed with \u201cAmerica\u2019s Funniest Home Videos,\u201d creating culture particularly through recorded dance moves. In other words: If you mess with Generation Z\u2019s favorite app, be ready for a fight.Help Desk: Ask our tech columnist a questionTikTok has taken some steps to distance itself from its owner \u2014 the app isn\u2019t even available directly in China. In May, it also hired an American CEO from Disney, Kevin Mayer.ADSo let\u2019s look at this decision beyond the geopolitical jousting. I recruited Patrick Jackson, chief technology officer of privacy company Disconnect, to help peer under the hood at what data the TikTok app actually gathers. (He\u2019s helped me conduct past studies of snooping iPhone apps and websites.)ADI also asked TikTok some pointed questions about its data practices.  @nickythomasalt I hate it here #tiktokbanned #tiktokban #gay #politics #facebook #boomers \u266c original sound - nickythomasalt   \u201cProtecting the privacy of our users\u2019 data is of the utmost importance to TikTok,\u201d said spokeswoman Ashley Nash-Hahn. \u201cTikTok collects much less U.S. user information than many of the companies in our space and stores it in the U.S. and Singapore. We have not, and would not, give it to the Chinese government.\u201dADMy takeaway: TikTok doesn\u2019t appear to grab any more personal information than Facebook. That\u2019s still an appalling amount of data to mine about the lives of Americans. But there\u2019s scant evidence that TikTok is sharing our data with China, and we should be wary of xenophobia dressed up as privacy concerns.I don\u2019t mean to excuse China\u2019s record of online repression \u2014 it\u2019s possible China will force TikTok to change its practices in the future. For now, it comes down to whether you inherently distrust data mining from Chinese-owned companies more than data mining from U.S.-owned ones. Just remember: companies in China probably make your phone, laptop and TV, too.Let\u2019s dive into the specifics.What data does TikTok gather?Aside from every TikTok video you watch \u2014 and how long you watch it for \u2014 TikTok has the full contents of private messages you can also send through its app.ADADIts U.S. privacy policy also says it gathers your country location, Internet address and the type of device you\u2019re using. If you give it permission, it will also grab your exact location, your phone\u2019s contacts and other social network connections, as well as your age and phone number.That all adds up to a profile of you useful not only to target ads, but also to understand who you are, who your friends and family are, what you like, what you find funny and what you say to your friends.Jackson, from Disconnect, said the app sends an \u201cabnormal\u201d amount of information from devices to its computers. When he opened TikTok, he found approximately 210 network requests in the first nine seconds, totaling over 500 kilobytes of data sent from the app to the Internet. (That\u2019s equivalent to half a megabyte, or 125 pages of typed data.) Much of it was information about the phone (like screen resolution and the Apple advertising identifier) that could be used to \u201cfingerprint\u201d your device even when you\u2019re not logged in.ADADAnd there is a hole in our ability to verify all of what TikTok does. Jackson said the app uses some technical measures to encode its activity, meaning some of it is hidden from independent researchers looking under the covers. \u201cIn order to disrupt hackers and those who wish to manipulate the app, we use obfuscation to help reduce automated attacks, like bots,\u201d Nash-Hahn said.Does the TikTok app do anything shady?In March, app developers at a company called Mysk discovered TikTok was accessing the contents of people\u2019s iPhone clipboards every few seconds, even when the app was running in the background. TikTok said it was an anti-spam measure, and has updated the app to stop it.ADIn December, researchers at Israeli security firm Check Point said they found bugs in the app that could have let attackers access personal data, which the company also says it fixed.Nobody reads privacy policies. This senator wants lawmakers to stop pretending we do.Last but not least: In 2019, TikTok paid $5.7 million to the Federal Trade Commission for violations of America\u2019s children\u2019s privacy law by its predecessor Musical.ly, which it acquired in 2017. It has since increased parental controls, though some children\u2019s advocacy groups say it is not sufficient.What are the U.S. government\u2019s concerns about TikTok?First, TikTok is under national security review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. (CFIUS) after lawmakers accused it of censoring some videos to satisfy the Chinese government. TikTok denies that. My colleagues Drew Harwell and Tony Romm reported last year that former U.S. employees bristled at commands to restrict videos that Beijing-based teams had deemed subversive or controversial. When your ultimate bosses are in China, it\u2019s hard to resist China\u2019s restrictive view of acceptable speech.ADADThe broader concern is that China could collect personal data about millions of Americans \u2014 one reason TikTok is banned for use on official devices by the U.S. Army. China\u2019s government has a lot of power over its technology companies, and generally expects them to comply with censorship demands or efforts to track down suspected spies or dissidents.CFIUS could force a sale of the company or take steps to prohibit its operations in the U.S. The government did that in 2019 with dating app Grindr, which had been purchased by a firm in China.Does TikTok data get stored in China?TikTok says user data is stored only in the U.S. and Singapore.Trust but verify: Jackson and I watched data flow out of the app, and did not see any headed to addresses that were clearly based in China. Most went to cloud services such as Amazon Web Services. But \u201cit\u2019s possible (and likely) that data transmitted to these servers are transferred to other locations but it\u2019s not verifiable from our end,\u201d Jackson said. He also found several references in the app to Internet addresses based in China or registered there, though saw no traffic going to them.ADADAnd good practices today don\u2019t necessarily mean good practices tomorrow. TikTok\u2019s U.S. privacy policy leaves the door open a crack. \u201cWe may share your information with a parent, subsidiary, or other affiliate of our corporate group,\u201d it reads.Bad WiFi is slowing you down. Fix yours without spending a dime.It\u2019s possible TikTok has changed some of its data practices for the better recently. A lawsuit filed in California claimed as recently as 2019 that TikTok was sending data to several Internet addresses in China, without citing sources for the claim. It also claimed the app contained source code from China\u2019s Internet giant Baidu, as well as advertising software called Igexin that security researchers have said has the capability to spy on people.Nash-Hahn declined to comment on the case, but said, \u201cWe neither use code of, nor send any data to, Baidu or Igexin.\u201d Lawyers for the case did not respond to a request for comment.Can the Chinese government force TikTok to hand over your data?TikTok said the Chinese government has never asked it for user data, and it would refuse such a request. TikTok also said its security team is led out of the U.S. by an executive who has decades of industry and U.S. law enforcement experience.ADHow well it could actually resist an order is a separate question.TikTok is trying to thread a difficult needle as a China-owned app that doesn\u2019t have to play by China\u2019s rules. In early July, it pulled out of the Google and Apple app stores in Hong Kong, following the implementation of a new sedition law in the Chinese special administrative region. The law could force companies that do business in Hong Kong to hand over data to China.And again, TikTok\u2019s privacy policy leaves a door open to responding to government requests \u2014 without specifying which governments. It reads: \u201cWe may disclose your information to respond to subpoenas, court orders, legal process, law enforcement requests, legal claims, or government inquiries.\u201dBut TikTok is hardly the Chinese government\u2019s only way to gather information about Americans. The U.S. has repeatedly accused it of espionage, including the 2017 hack of the Equifax credit reporting agency. Americans\u2019 personal data is put at risk every day by American corporations that collect, sell and store it in insecure ways.Is TikTok better or worse than Facebook?In some ways, TikTok gathers less data. In addition to most of the types of personal information we saw TikTok gathering, Facebook also tracks users across devices, and inside other apps and websites. As I\u2019ve written, it even tracks you when you\u2019re not using Facebook and your phone is off. We didn\u2019t see any behavior close to that in the TikTok app.AD\u201cIt doesn\u2019t appear that TikTok takes more data than Facebook but they do take measures to hide what they are collecting,\u201d Jackson said.You downloaded FaceApp. Here\u2019s what you\u2019ve just done to your privacy.Facebook has also run afoul of the FTC, including a $5 billion settlement over privacy invasions \u2014 the largest fine in the FTC\u2019s history.Is there anything you can do to reduce your privacy risk and keep using TikTok?A TikTok privacy setting called \u201cpersonalized ads\u201d will let you stop the app from using your information to target you with ads, but it won\u2019t stop TikTok from collecting the data in the first place.My general privacy rule is: When in doubt, fib. There\u2019s no reason to give TikTok your real name or access to your contacts or other social media connections. Pick a fake name and a throwaway email address.You can also use TikTok without giving it your phone number or email by never logging in \u2014 you can still watch videos in the app and on the open Web, though you won\u2019t be able to follow specific accounts or upload videos of your own. And this still won\u2019t stop TikTok from gathering other information about your device.", "comment": "182 Comments", "topic": "Consumer Tech"}, {"cover": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/A27CX2F33YI6VF6BNTYRN77CNQ.jpghttps://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/A27CX2F33YI6VF6BNTYRN77CNQ.jpg", "title": "The Technology 202: Jeff Bezos faces critical exam of his massive e-commerce empire in first Hill testimony", "date": "Jul 27, 2020", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/07/27/technology-202-jeff-bezos-faces-critical-exam-his-massive-e-commerce-empire-first-hill-testimony/", "keyword": "China and Security", "website": "the Washington Post", "author": "Cat Zakrzewski", "content": "with Tonya RileyJeff Bezos, the wealthiest man in the world, built a massive empire without ever appearing before Congress.

Subscribe today.arrow-rightIt's a critical moment for Amazon: Bezos, its chief executive, will address the company's explosive growth, which has only has surged as the pandemic intensified consumers' reliance on online shopping. The boom sent Bezos's personal wealth and company stock price skyrocketing \u2014 and Amazon went on one of the largest hiring sprees in the world. (Bezos also owns The Washington Post.)\u00a0But lawmakers on the House Judiciary antitrust subcommittee examining Silicon Valley's size and power will be eager to grill Bezos on the controversies that accompanied its whirlwind growth, such as allegations the company violated its own policies by using data about rival sellers to develop competing products. Lawmakers are also likely to press Bezos on the firing of warehouse workers who protested safety conditions.\u00a0\u201cJeff Bezos has really raised the ire for many members of Congress and Americans,\u201d said Dipayan Ghosh, a fellow at the Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy at the Harvard Kennedy School.Lawmakers on the panel have questioned whether Amazon lied to investigators about its business practices.\u00a0Company executives previously told lawmakers that it didn't leverage data from third-party sellers on its platforms to decide whether to launch competing products \u2014 a position at odds with recent news reports. Amazon declined to comment for this article.\u00a0ADADThe company's critics are ready for fireworks. \u201cLawmakers are finally beginning to scrutinize the extraordinary power that Jeff Bezos has amassed,\u201d said Stacy Mitchell, co-director of the Institute for Local Self-Reliance and a top critic of the company. \u201cMany American companies, large and small, live in fear because Bezos controls their market access and can simply crush them if he wants to. It\u2019s stunning that Congress hasn't compelled him to answer for that until now.\u201dAmazon earlier this year launched an internal investigation following the Wall Street Journal's report. \u201cLike other retailers, we look at sales and store data to provide our customers with the best possible experience,\u201d Amazon said in a written statement. \u201cHowever, we strictly prohibit our employees from using nonpublic, seller-specific data to determine which private label products to launch.\u201dIt remains to be seen whether an increasingly divided Congress will crack down or meaningfully reform the tech industry.\u00a0The hearing broadly marks an opportunity to publicize long-running grievances with the tech industry at a high-profile event, my colleague Tony Romm writes this morning of the big event, which will also feature Apple\u2019s Tim Cook, Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg and Google\u2019s Sundar Pichai.\u00a0ADADCongressional lawmakers for months have been collecting evidence about the tech companies' practices, demanding documents and emails from the companies and executives themselves. They've also heard directly from smaller, competing companies that say the companies have engaged in anticompetitive behavior. \u00a0PopSockets, the maker of smartphone kickstands, said earlier this year that the e-commerce giant's policies made it difficult to sell their products on their terms and prices.\u00a0\u201cThe most important thing is for the subcommittee to get to the bottom of questions that Amazon has been trying to dodge throughout this investigation,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cAmazon's stonewalled on supplying requested documents. It's offered vague and incomplete responses to written questions.\u201d\u201cThis hearing is a turning point,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cI hope what we\u2019ll see is that lawmakers are no longer going to be taking a subservient posture toward Amazon.\u201d\u00a0But Bezos is no neophyte to Washington.Amazon is valued at roughly $1.5 trillion, and Bezos's net worth is about $179 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. That's nearly double that of Zuckerberg, the next richest executive appearing.\u00a0ADADEven though he hasn't testified before, Bezos is no stranger to this town. In addition to his ownership of The Post, he purchased one of the largest homes in Washington's high-end Kalorama neighborhood. Before the pandemic, he hosted major parties there with top Washington officials, including members of the Trump administration and family.His company has also decided to locate its long-anticipated second headquarters just across the river, in Northern Virginia. It's very likely that these social and business ties will also come under scrutiny.\u00a0It remains to be seen what Bezos's style will be under the congressional spotlight.\u00a0Zuckerberg, Pichai and Cook have all testified in front of Congress before.\u00a0ADZuckerberg has become a frequent fixture on Capitol Hill in recent years, testifying on everything from the company's plans to push into cryptocurrency to a massive data privacy scandal, known as Cambridge Analytica. Lawmakers grilled Pichai, now the chief executive of Google's parent company Alphabet, in 2018 on a wide range of grievances, ranging from privacy to national security concerns. While Apple has tried to avoid much of the techlash directed at other companies in the wake of Russian interference in the 2016 election, Cook previously testified in 2013 on the company's tax policies.\u00a0Our top tabsGoogle will work from home at least until July 2021.It\u2019s the first company to adopt such a long timeline, the Wall Street Journal\u2019s Rob Copeland writes.\u00a0ADADThe announcement will probably pressure other technology companies to reevaluate timelines, after previously saying employees could return as soon as January. Pichai made the decision himself last week, following discussion with an internal group of top executives.\u00a0The company notified a handful of Google employees about the decision later in the week. \u201cPichai was swayed in part by sympathy for employees with families to plan for uncertain school years that may involve at-home instruction, depending on geography,\u201d Rob writes. The decision applies to employees in most of its major offices, including the headquarters of Mountain View, Calif., and other offices in the U.S., U.K., India, Brazil and others.TikTok will remove tags related to the QAnon conspiracy theory from its search feature.Videos containing the tags will remain on the platform, however, BBC News reports. Videos touting the conspiracy theory will also still show up in a user's feed if the app's algorithm directs them to the content.ADADThe move responds to a shift from major platforms in dealing with the conspiracy theory, which alleges that \u201cdeep state\u201d actors are seeking to undermine President Trump and are involved in child trafficking. Twitter banned 7,000 related accounts and put limitations on 150,000 others last week, citing an uptick in coordinated harassment.While TikTok skews toward a younger audience, the conspiracy theory started to take a foothold on the app in recent months. Videos promoting a baseless conspiracy theory alleging retailer Wayfair of shipping children in storage cabinets rapidly spread across the platform earlier this month, racking up millions of views. QAnon supporters, including three conservative congressional candidates, helped amplify the conspiracy theory.Facebook and YouTube are also considering limiting the spread of QAnon videos, Rachel Lerman and Elizabeth Dwoskin reported.Pro-Trump Sinclair TV stations put on hold plans to air an interview featuring the viral \"Plandemic\" video star.The conservative broadcaster delayed the interview after backlash on social media, Meryl Kornfield reports.\u00a0ADADIn the interview, Judy Mikovits, a former medical researcher featured in the viral coronavirus conspiracy theory video, accuses Anthony S. Fauci of manufacturing the coronavirus and shipping it to Wuhan, China. Mikovits also alleges that Trump has proof of China's involvement in creating the virus. Neither of the claims is supported by any evidence.\u00a0Left-leaning media watchdog Media Matters first spotted an online version of the interview, leading to the backlash. YouTube, Vimeo and Facebook all removed the conspiracy theory video in May for spreading harmful and misleading health misinformation.\u201cWe will spend the coming days bringing together other viewpoints and provide additional context,\u201d Sinclair shared in a statement after pulling the video. \u201cAll stations have been notified not to air this and will instead be re-airing last week\u2019s episode in its place.\u201d\u00a0ADADThe show's host, Eric Bolling, echoed the statement and says he has invited Fauci to appear on his show.An Instagram bug sparked user concerns that the app was spying on them.\u00a0A new version of the app set off an Apple notification that users' cameras were on when they were not taking a video or photo, the Verge reports.\u00a0The company said the notification was the result of a faulty piece of code. \u201cWe only access your camera when you tell us to \u2014 for example when you swipe from Feed to Camera. We found and are fixing a bug in iOS 14 Beta that mistakenly indicates that some people are using the camera when they aren\u2019t,\u201d a representative told the Verge. \u201cWe do not access your camera in those instances, and no content is recorded.\u201d\u00a0This isn't the first time that Apple's new features, which are designed to give users more insight into how apps are using their phones, have sparked a privacy concern. Another feature flagged to users earlier this month that TikTok's app was accessing text their phones copied, including passwords. TikTok said the access was used to prevent spam but that it would discontinue the feature.Rant and raveThe New York Times's columnist Maureen Dowd sat down with Tesla chief executive and heavy Twitter user Elon Musk.

Miller, a senior Pentagon special operations and counterterrorism official and Army Special Forces veteran, is seeking to lead the NCTC in the wake of the firing of Russell Travers by the then-acting director of national intelligence, Richard Grenell.Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) came to the hearing angry, telling Hovakimian that \u201cmy hometown of Portland has been invaded\u201d by federal law enforcement forces who are \u201cbeating, teargassing and detaining my neighbors.\u201d He pressed Hovakimian to state what he thought of unidentified federal forces \u201cin unmarked cars\u201d detaining protesters.\u201cGenerally speaking, it\u2019s a great idea to identify oneself as a federal law enforcement officer,\u201d Hovakimian said. \u201cI will say that the department takes the constitutional rights of Americans very seriously.\u201dADADWyden accused Hovakimian of \u201cducking\u201d his question and said he would oppose his nomination.Facing unrest on American streets, Trump turns Homeland Security powers inwardSen. Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.) asked Hovakimian about a Department of Homeland Security memo that authorizes its Office of Intelligence and Analysis to collect information on protesters who threaten to damage or destroy public memorials and statues, regardless of whether they are on federal property.Hovakimian said, \u201cI can\u2019t speak to what DHS is or isn\u2019t doing, but I can say that Americans\u2019 right to free speech and free expression, including around statues and monuments, is of paramount importance to me.\u201dHeinrich pressed Hovakimian on whether he thought the threat of violence to monuments rises to the level of requiring intelligence collection, especially if it comes at the cost of not gathering information on white-supremacy groups that have threatened to commit acts of violence. Hovakimian skirted the question, saying it was \u201cdifficult to opine categorically on hypotheticals.\u201dADADHeinrich noted that Hovakimian earlier answered \u201cstraightforwardly\u201d a question from Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) about whether  intelligence authorities should be used as part of domestic law enforcement operations.\u201cA bedrock principle of our country is that Americans who are engaging in activities entirely protected by the First Amendment .\u2009.\u2009.  ought not to be targeted or surveilled solely on the basis of that protected activity,\u201d Hovakimian told Feinstein. \u201cIn a word, that kind of stuff happening here .\u2009.\u2009. is very serious.\u201dHovakimian came in for the harshest grilling from Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.), who asked whether Hovakimian had been involved \u201cin any way\u201d in advising on sending federal law enforcement into American cities. \u201cI have sight lines into many things,\u201d he said finally, \u201cthis does not happen to be one of them.\u201dADADShe was particularly upset by his indirect answers to her questions about whether he had any role in the Justice Department Office of Legal Counsel\u2019s opinion that a whistleblower complaint involving allegations that Trump pressed the Ukrainian president for political favors need not be shared with Congress expeditiously.He noted that the complaint eventually was shared, an answer that Harris took as stonewalling.Hovakimian\u2019s answers also bothered Sen. Mark R. Warner (D-Va.), the panel vice-chairman, who reminded Hovakimian that the two had discussed the OLC opinion. \u201cYou said that you thought it was very important that Congress get the [whistleblower] reports,\u201d Warner said.AD\u201cYet you didn\u2019t respond to Senator Harris as to whether you were involved at all and acted like you did not know what she was talking about,\u201d he continued.ADHovakimian eventually said he was not involved.Miller, who had an easier time before the committee,  said he viewed as \u201cthe height of irresponsibility\u201d leaving the fight against violent extremist organizations to the next generation. \u201cIt is my life\u2019s goal, whether confirmed for this position or in another capacity, to defeat al-Qaeda and its affiliates\u201d and \u201ctransition this war to a sustainable effort\u201d focused on monitoring terrorist threats and expanding global partnerships, he said.Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.) asked Miller how he planned to reduce \u201cduplication\u201d of analysis taking place at the NCTC and other agencies. \u201cDuplication is all right to a point,\u201d Miller said, \u201cbut to use tax dollars correctly, we don\u2019t need too much, and I\u2019m going to take that one on loud and clear.\u201dADIn response to a question from Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), he acknowledged that there was \u201chuge concern\u201d about the reduced analytical staff at the NCTC, as other agencies reassign personnel to \u201chigher priority\u201dareas such as strategic competition with Russia and China. He pledged that if confirmed, he would assess whether the NCTC\u2019s resources were adequate for its mission under the 2004 law that created the center.\n\n", "comment": "0 Comments", "topic": "National Security"}, {"cover": "", "title": "US: Researcher being harbored at Chinese consulate in SF", "date": "Jul 23, 2020", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/courts_law/fbi-researcher-being-harbored-at-chinese-consulate-in-sf/2020/07/23/3461d1e2-cced-11ea-99b0-8426e26d203b_story.html", "keyword": "China and Security", "website": "the Washington Post", "author": "", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Chinese consulate in San Francisco is harboring a Chinese researcher who lied about her military background, the Justice Department said Thursday as it announced charges against that scientist and three others accused of concealing their government ties.Support our journalism.

All are charged with visa fraud.The FBI, meanwhile, has interviewed visa holders in more than 25 American cities who are suspected of concealing their ties to the Chinese military. The Justice Department believes that the deception is part of an ongoing, government-sponsored effort to steal research and innovation from American universities for Beijing\u2019s economic gain.ADAD\u201cThis is another part of the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s plan to take advantage of our open society and exploit academic institutions,\u201d John Demers, the Justice Department\u2019s top national security official, said in a statement.The allegation comes amid rising tension between the U.S. and China, particularly related to theft of intellectual property \u2014 including by Chinese researchers with military and government connections \u2014 for Beijing\u2019s benefit. Just this week, the U.S. ordered the closure of the Chinese consulate in Houston, and the Justice Department charged two Chinese hackers with targeting firms working on vaccines for the coronavirus.Trump administration officials have escalated their public condemnations of China in the last several weeks, with speeches by FBI Director Chris Wray, Attorney General William Barr and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.ADADThe FBI believes that one of the four defendants, Tang Juan, has been harbored for weeks in the Chinese consulate in San Francisco, though that could not immediately be confirmed. The Justice Department says the scientist, who is listed in some court filings as Juan Tang, lied about her military affiliation in a visa application last October to work at the University of California, Davis and again during an FBI interview.Agents found photographs of Tang in a uniform of the PLA civilian cadre and also reviewed articles from China that identified her military affiliation.The FBI last month interviewed Tang, when she denied having served in the military or knowing the significance of the insignia on the uniform she was photographed wearing, and also found more evidence of her military affiliation when they later searched her home, according to court filings.ADAD\u201cThe FBI assesses that, at some point following the search and interview of Tang on June 20, 2020, Tang went to the Chinese consulate in San Francisco, where the FBI assesses she has remained,\u201d prosecutors wrote in a July 20 court filing that sought the detention of another Chinese scientist who the Justice Department says lied about her military background to enter the U.S.The document alleges efforts by multiple Chinese nationals to conceal their ties to the military or government, and says \u201cthe Chinese government has instructed PLA members in the United States to obstruct justice by deleting information from their devices.\u201dIn a statement, UC Davis said its medical school was providing law enforcement officials with information they had requested.

It went on and on.Support our journalism. Subscribe today.arrow-rightBut rather than rehash old ground, in this roundup we will focus on Trump\u2019s claims against his election rival, former vice president Joe Biden. Violating norms and protocol, the president used the august setting of the Rose Garden for a sustained campaign-style attack. Here are some of the more noteworthy claims he made. We don\u2019t award Pinocchios in roundups, but many of these statements are wildly off-course.\u201cBiden personally led the effort to give China permanent, most-favored nation status, which is a tremendous advantage for a country to have. Few countries have it. But the United States doesn\u2019t have it. Never did. Probably never even asked for it, because they didn\u2019t know what they were doing.\u201dADADFalse. \u201cMost favored\u201d trading status is one of those confusing inside-the-Beltway terms that apparently the president still does not understand. It just means normal trading relations. (As the World Trade Organization explains: \u201cIt suggests special treatment, but in the WTO it actually means non-discrimination \u2014 treating virtually everyone equally.\u201d)In the case of China, normal trade relations were suspended in 1951 after the communist takeover and then restored in 1980 on a rolling basis. Bill Clinton led the way for permanent resumption of normal trading status, not Joe Biden, and it was George W. Bush who established it in 2001.Contrary to Trump\u2019s statement, the United States has normal trading relations with just about every country in the world. The only exceptions are Cuba and North Korea.ADAD\u201cAmerica lost nearly 10,000 factories while Joe Biden was vice president. Think of that: 10,000 factories.\u201dBarack Obama took office in the midst of a recession, when hundreds of thousands of jobs a month were being shed, so be wary of numbers that record over an entire presidential term. (Similarly, the current recession has wiped away any gains earlier in Trump\u2019s term.) In Obama\u2019s second term, 10,000 factories were added. But we hesitate even to use the phrase.\u201cFactories\u201d may conjure up images of smokestacks and production lines, but the data set Trump cited is not really about factories. Trump is citing a Bureau of Labor Statistics database set known as the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages. More than 80 percent of these \u201cmanufacturing establishments\u201d employ five or fewer people, as the data includes such \u201cfactories\u201d as bakeries, candy stores and custom tailors.ADAD\u201cHe opposed my very strict travel ban on Chinese nationals to stop the spread of the China virus. He was totally against it. \u2018Xenophobic,\u2019 he called me. \u2018Xenophobic.\u2019 A month later, he admitted I was right.\u201dTrump is seizing on a comment Biden made the day Trump announced the travel restrictions. But whether Biden was specifically speaking about Trump\u2019s travel restrictions is open to debate.\u201cWe have, right now, a crisis with the coronavirus, from China,\u201d Biden said during an Iowa campaign appearance on Jan. 31. \u201cThis is no time for Donald Trump\u2019s record of hysteria and xenophobia \u2014 hysterical xenophobia \u2014 and fearmongering to lead the way instead of science.\u201d Biden went on to criticize Trump for proposing cuts in global health programs and for folding a White House pandemic office into another unit. But he did not specifically mention the travel restrictions on China.ADADThe restrictions were signaled shortly after noon on Jan. 31, after rumors that the Trump administration was considering halting flights. The travel restrictions were announced at 3:55 p.m. Biden took the stage about 15 minutes later.The Biden campaign says Biden was not referring to the travel restrictions and notes that the former vice president\u2019s remarks were similar to those in an opinion column he wrote that was published in USA Today four days earlier. \u201cI remember how Trump sought to stoke fear and stigma during the 2014 Ebola epidemic,\u201d Biden wrote on Jan. 27, such as advocating \u201creactionary travel bans.\u201d The comment included a link to a Trump tweet from 2014, urging Obama to \u201cclose down the flights from Ebola infected areas right now.\u201d (At the time, there were no direct flights from Ebola-affected areas to the United States.)\u201cIf we had listened to Joe Biden, hundreds of thousands of additional lives would have been lost.\u201dADADThere\u2019s no evidence Trump\u2019s restrictions on travel from China saved \u201chundreds of thousands\u201d of lives. The Trump administration imposed an entry ban on all foreign nationals who were in the People\u2019s Republic of China, excluding Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macao, in the previous 14 days, effective Feb. 2. But it included many exceptions. Moreover, many U.S. airlines already were canceling flights.The New York Times in early April estimated nearly 40,000 people had traveled from China to the United States in the two months after Trump imposed restrictions on such travel \u2014 and at least 430,000 people had arrived in the United States on direct flights from China since Dec. 31. While Trump often suggests the United States imposed the first ban, dozens of countries acted before the United States.The testing criteria set by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were extremely narrow: Only those with recent travel to China or those who had come into contact with a confirmed infection would be tested. Moreover, because the Trump administration bungled testing in February, allowing for few tests of Americans, it had little idea that the coronavirus was spreading silently through the country.ADAD\u201cIf you look at the job he did on swine flu \u2014 I looked at a poll \u2014 they have polls on everything nowadays \u2014 and he \u2014 they got very bad marks on the job they did on the swine flu, H1N1. He calls it 'N1H1\u2032 H1N1. He got very poor marks from Gallup on the job they did on swine flu. And they stopped, very early on, testing. They totally stopped it. They just said, \u2018Stop.\u2019\u201dUnder fire for a sluggish response, Trump has targeted the Obama administration\u2019s handling of the 2009 swine flu outbreak. But Obama\u2019s handling was widely praised at the time as the right mix of action and no overreaction.The estimated death toll in the United States during the H1N1 epidemic was 12,469 from April 2009 to April 2010, using an after-the-fact statistical analysis. That was much less than a forecast of 30,000 to 90,000 deaths made in August 2009 by the President\u2019s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology.ADADTrump claims Obama got \u201cvery poor marks from Gallup,\u201d but he would be gratified to get Obama\u2019s numbers. Two Gallup polls found 74 percent (May 2009) and 60 percent (August 2009) had confidence the government could handle the swine flu outbreak. By comparison, just 42 percent approve of Trump\u2019s handling of the coronavirus pandemic in the most recent Gallup poll.As for halting testing, this is strange Trump spin. The Obama administration decided that it would conserve government resources if it assumed flu cases with certain symptoms and risk factors could be deemed \u201cprobable\u201d H1N1 flu. So testing for the flu did not end, just extensive testing to identify this particular strain. Laboratory-confirmed deaths continued to be counted. (The decision did earn some criticism, as it turned out the number of probable cases was probably overestimated.)\u201cThe 2009 H1N1 strain was highly transmissible but did not induce more severe illness in adults or children than typical seasonal influenza viruses,\u201d said Tom Frieden, who was CDC director from 2009 to 2017. \u201cTherefore, most people who contracted the virus had no reason to seek diagnosis or care; for every laboratory confirmed case from April to October 2009, there were estimated to be 79 cases that did not seek testing. So it was never practical to identify cases, trace their contacts, and ask exposed people to quarantine. In July 2009, the CDC advised states it was no longer necessary to report the individual cases up for aggregation \u2014 but never \u2018stopped testing.\u2019 Collecting national data was no longer important because under those circumstances, the data were not a good measure of the scale of the epidemic, nor actionable for contact tracing.\u201dADADFrieden added: \u201cThe covid-19 pandemic is qualitatively different: the virus is highly transmissible and induces severe disease in many cases. Although not everyone who contracts the virus seeks and receives testing, a higher share do, so testing data is a more useful indicator of the direction of the epidemic.\u201d\u201cThese are actual key elements of the Biden-Sanders unity platform: Abolish immigration detention. No more detention. You come in here illegally, no more detention.\u201dNope. Remember: Biden surged in the Democratic primary running as a moderate alternative to more liberal candidates who proposed to decriminalize border crossings or abolish the agency in charge of deportations, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).The Biden campaign\u2019s immigration page says he would \u201cseek alternatives\u201d to migrant detention and work with nonprofits that help manage immigration cases for families awaiting hearings and released into the country. Under a legal settlement from 1997 known as the Flores agreement, U.S. immigration officials must release underage migrants in their custody within 20 days, usually to a relative or shelter. Biden\u2019s website says he would \u201cmove migrants into safe environments as quickly as possible\u201d and \u201cend for-profit detention centers.\u201dThe Biden-Sanders unity task force, which issued recommendations to Biden, not set-in-stone policies, similarly says \u201cdetention should be a last resort, not the default.\u201d\u201cDemocrats will prioritize investments in more effective and cost-efficient community-based alternatives to detention,\u201d the task force said. \u201cWe will end for-profit detention centers and ensure that any facility where migrants are being detained is held to the highest standards of care and guarantees the safety and dignity of families. Detention of children should be restricted to the shortest possible time, with their access to education and proper care ensured.\u201d\u201cStop all deportation. So if we get a MS-13 gang member, which we\u2019ve taken out of our country by the thousands \u2014 brought them back to Honduras, Guatemala \u2014 can\u2019t do that anymore \u2014 El Salvador. Can\u2019t do that anymore. Stop all deportations. So in other words, we\u2019ll take all of these people \u2014 many of whom are in prison for rape, murder, lots of other things.\u201dNeither Biden nor the unity task force has called for a full stop, though Biden has vowed a return to an Obama-era policy of prioritizing violent offenders and national security threats for deportation. Biden is also pledging a 100-day moratorium \u201con any deportations of people already in the United States.\u201dOn his campaign website, Biden says he would \u201crestore sensible enforcement priorities,\u201d \u201cdirect enforcement efforts toward threats to public safety and national security,\u201d end workplace immigration raids and \u201cprotect sensitive locations from immigration enforcement actions.\u201d\u201cNo one should be afraid to seek medical attention, go to school, their job, or their place of worship for fear of an immigration enforcement action,\u201d the Biden website says.The Biden-Sanders unity task force did not recommend a stop to deportations.The Trump campaign tweeted \u201cI\u2019m on Team Joe\u201d next to an image of shirtless, tattooed \u201cMS-13 gang members.\u201d But the reality is that Biden would make it easier than Trump to deport MS-13 gang members. The Obama-era policy was to put violent offenders such as gang members at the front of the deportation line. Trump took office and rolled back Obama\u2019s executive order, allowing immigration authorities to prioritize whatever they choose.\u201cExpand asylum for all new illegal aliens. How about that one? All new illegal aliens, expand asylum.\u201dIt\u2019s more accurate to say that the Trump administration has imposed a series of new restrictions on asylum claims and Biden would lift them.The Biden immigration page says he would reverse Trump\u2019s additional restrictions on asylum seekers traveling through Mexico or Guatemala, would not prosecute asylum seekers for \u201cmisdemeanor illegal entry,\u201d and would undo attempts \u201cto prevent victims of gang and domestic violence from receiving asylum,\u201d among other changes.The Trump administration pioneered a program known as \u201cRemain in Mexico,\u201d or the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP), under which mostly Central American migrants petitioning for asylum in the United States wait in Mexico while their U.S. immigration cases are pending. Democrats and migrant advocates say the arrangement exposes those asylum seekers to danger, which is not allowed under international laws covering refugees. Biden\u2019s website says he would end the MPP initiative \u201cand restore our asylum laws so that they do what they should be designed to do \u2014 protect people fleeing persecution and who cannot return home safely.\u201dBiden also pledges to increase the number of asylum officers, to process applications faster.\u201cMigrants who qualify for an asylum claim will be admitted to the country through an orderly process and connected with resources that will help them care for themselves,\u201d the Biden website says. \u201cMigrants who do not qualify will have the opportunity to make their claim before an immigration judge, but if they are unable to satisfy the court, the government will help facilitate their successful reintegration into their home countries.\u201dThe unity task force similarly says, \u201cDemocrats will end Trump Administration policies that deny protected entry to asylum seekers\u201d and adds, \u201cWe will end prosecution of asylum seekers at the border and policies that force them to apply from \u2018safe third countries,\u2019 which are far from safe.\u201d\u201cHis son [Hunter Biden] walked out with $1.5 billion of money to invest, where he\u2019ll make hundreds of thousands of dollars \u2014 maybe millions of dollars a year. Walked out with $1.5 billion. I asked one of the biggest people on Wall Street \u2014 maybe the biggest \u2014 \u2018Is that possible?\u2019 He said, \u2018No.' He\u2019s never seen it. They don\u2019t do that.\u201dTrump\u2019s Wall Street friend may be onto something \u2014 because there is no evidence to support these statements.In December 2013, Hunter Biden and one of his daughters flew from Japan to China with Joe Biden on Air Force Two as the vice president embarked on a diplomatic mission. Twelve days after he flew to Beijing, Hunter Biden joined an advisory board of a fund called BHR Partners, which had announced it would try to raise $1.5 billion. While Joe Biden was vice president, Hunter Biden was only on the board of the advisory firm that did not directly invest, but instead advised those who did.George Mesires, a lawyer for Hunter Biden, said the younger Biden only took an equity stake in 2017, after Joe Biden was no longer vice president. Mesires told The Fact Checker that the investment management company \u201cwas capitalized from various sources with a total of 30 million RMB [Chinese renminbi], or about $4.2 million, not $1.5 billion.\u201d Because Biden acquired a 10 percent minority interest, his \u201ccapital commitment is approximately $420,000,\u201d Mesires said. \u201cTo date, Mr. Biden has not received any return or compensation on account of this investment or his position on the board of directors,\u201d Mesires added. Hunter Biden announced he would resign from the board of the company on Oct. 31, 2019.\u201cAs Vice President, Biden was a leading advocate of the Paris climate accord, which was unbelievably expensive to our country. It would\u2019ve crushed American manufacturers while allowing China to pollute \u2014 pollute the atmosphere with impunity.\u201dEach country set its own commitments under the Paris accord. So Trump could have unilaterally changed the commitments offered by Obama, which is technically allowed under the agreement.Moreover, China, in its Paris accord commitment, said that, compared with 2005 levels, it would seek to cut its carbon emissions by 60 to 65 percent per unit of gross domestic product by 2030. China pledged to reach these goals by 2030. The Climate Action Tracker says Beijing has policies in place to meet and even overachieve its Paris accord targets, even if it remains insufficient to halt global warming of temperatures.\u201cAbolish \u2014 in the suburbs, you\u2019re going to abolish the suburbs with this. Enforce Obama-Biden\u2019s radical AFFH \u2014 that\u2019s the AFFH regulation that threatens to strip localities of federal affordable housing funds unless they change their zoning laws to fit the federal government\u2019s demands. So what you have \u2014 I mean, I\u2019ve been watching this for years in Westchester, coming from New York. They want low-income housing built in a neighborhood. Well, I\u2019m ending that rule. I\u2019m taking it out, so \u2014 I spoke with Ben Carson the other day. We\u2019re going to be taking it out. I\u2019ve watched that whole thing go, and now they want to make it twice as bad in the suburbs \u2014 in the suburbs. Mothers aren\u2019t happy about that. Fathers aren\u2019t happy about that. They worked hard to buy a house, and now they\u2019re going to watch the housing values drop like a rock, and that has happened. It dropped like a rock. So we\u2019re not going to do that; we\u2019re going to do the exact opposite.\u201dThe Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing rule (AFFH) does not aim to bulldoze the suburbs. Rather, the rule is the latest attempt to push the Department of Housing and Urban Development to do more to enforce and implement a section of the Fair Housing Act of 1968 requiring the government to \u201caffirmatively further fair housing.\u201dThe rule, which was finalized in July 2015 and has been in limbo since Obama left office, is designed to push \u201cmeaningful actions, in addition to combating discrimination, that overcome patterns of segregation and foster inclusive communities free from barriers that restrict access to opportunity based on protected characteristics.\u201d Put simply, it was designed to help state and local officials provide better access to opportunity, following the original 1968 guideline.For evidence of the bleak future, Trump points to his own experience \u201cwatching this for years.\u201d But he goes on to bungle the facts, suggesting that following the AFFH would lead to \u201chousing values [dropping] like a rock.\u201d Most research suggests that the proximity of affordable housing does not depress property values.The president ought to be familiar with fair housing rules. The government charged Trump, along with his father and their company, with violating the Fair Housing Act in 1973 for not renting to blacks. The Trumps eventually signed a consent decree in 1975, which they were accused of violating just three years later.(About our rating scale)Send us facts to check by filling out this formSign up for The Fact Checker weekly newsletterThe Fact Checker is a verified signatory to the International Fact-Checking Network code of principles", "comment": "133 Comments", "topic": "Fact Checker"}, {"cover": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/7MO2OIGHWEI6VKBFQ4RAATSBKA.jpghttps://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/7MO2OIGHWEI6VKBFQ4RAATSBKA.jpg", "title": "If Trump makes a comeback, it\u2019ll be because he relied on disgust of the elites", "date": "Jul 21, 2020", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/07/21/trump-will-run-his-handling-coronavirus-china/", "keyword": "China and Security", "website": "the Washington Post", "author": "Hugh Hewitt", "content": "In the critically acclaimed HBO series \u201cThe Wire,\u201d the second of its five seasons features a longshoreman union boss, Frank Sobotka, caught up in a web of crime, in part because of his desperate effort to attract government funding to revitalize the Port of Baltimore to save his union\u2019s jobs.Support our journalism.

In April, 78% of those in households with a job loss thought they\u2019d be temporary. Now, 47% think that lost job is definitely or probably not coming back, according to the latest poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.ADThe poll is the latest sign the solid hiring of May and June, as some states lifted stay-at-home orders and the economy began to recover, may wane as the year goes on.

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement also confirmed that all children had been taken away from the hotel, two days after The Associated Press reported that it was one of three hotels used nearly 200 times for detention of children as young as 1.But ICE repeatedly refused to answer questions about where contractors have taken the children, citing a potential security risk.\u201cThe Trump administration is holding children in secret in hotels, refusing to give lawyers access to them so it can expel them back to danger without even a chance for the children to show they warrant asylum,\u201d said Lee Gelernt, a lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union, which filed suit on behalf of the Texas Civil Rights Project.ADADGelernt said suing on behalf of unnamed children was necessary \u201cbecause the government is refusing to provide any information about the children.\u201d The lawsuit was filed in Washington federal court, and Gelernt said he would seek to include any minors detained at the hotel as of Thursday.___26 deaths in 3 US convents, as nuns confront the pandemicLIVONIA, Michigan \u2014 At a convent near Detroit, 13 nuns have died of COVID-19.

Democratic leaders in Oregon say federal intervention has worsened the two-month crisis, and the state attorney general sued to allege that some people had been whisked off the streets in unmarked vehicles.ADU.S. District Judge Michael Mosman said the state lacked standing to sue on behalf of protesters because the lawsuit was a \u201chighly unusual one with a particular set of rules.\u201dOregon was seeking a restraining order on behalf of its residents not for injuries that had already happened but to prevent injuries by federal officers in the future. That combination makes the standard for granting such a motion very narrow, and the state did not prove it had standing in the case, Mosman wrote.ADLegal experts who reviewed the case before the decision warned that he could reject it on those grounds. A lawsuit from a person accusing federal agents of violating their rights to free speech or against unconstitutional search and seizure would have a much higher chance of success, Michael Dorf, a constitutional law professor at Cornell University, said ahead of the ruling.AD___Chinese researcher charged with US visa fraud is in custodySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 A Chinese researcher accused of concealing her ties to the Chinese military on a visa application she submitted so she could work in the U.S. was booked Friday into a Northern California jail and was expected to appear in federal court Monday.Sacramento County jail records show Juan Tang, 37, was being held on behalf of federal authorities after she was arrested by the U.S. Marshals Service. It was unclear if she had an attorney who could comment on her behalf.The Justice Department on Thursday announced charges against Tang and three other scientists living in the U.S., saying they lied about their status as members of China\u2019s People\u2019s Liberation Army. All were charged with visa fraud.Tang was the last of the four to be arrested, after the justice department accused the Chinese consulate in San Francisco of harboring a known fugitive. The consulate did not immediately respond to email and Facebook messages seeking comment and it was not possible to leave a telephone message.ADThe Justice Department said Tang lied about her military ties in a visa application last October as she made plans to work at the University of California, Davis and again during an FBI interview months later. Agents found photos of Tang dressed in military uniform and reviewed articles in China identifying her military affiliation.___Despite COVID crisis, Congress seeks to do its day jobWASHINGTON \u2014 Even as lawmakers stumble in their quest to pass another coronavirus response measure, both the House and Senate sought to return to some semblance of normal business this week, passing annual must-do measures on spending and defense policy despite the challenges of legislating during a pandemic.On Friday, the House passed a $259 billion funding bill for foreign aid and the Interior, Agriculture, and Veterans Affairs departments along party lines. The measure is the first annual spending measure to pass either the House or Senate this year, but it has scant chance of becoming law, serving instead as a springboard for negotiations down the line.The annual process of appropriating federal spending \u2014 which has been a refuge of bipartisan deal-making during Trump\u2019s presidency \u2014 has been eclipsed this year by coronavirus relief efforts. But funding the government remains the biggest must-do item for lawmakers on a legislative agenda that, due to the virus, has been trimmed back to the essentials.Friday\u2019s spending legislation is studded with $38 billion in emergency funding that violates the spirit of last year\u2019s nearly-forgotten budget and debt accord, along with other provisions that are controversial with Republicans, but many of its nuts and bolts elements were generated in the Appropriations Committee\u2019s tradition of bipartisan collaboration.\u201cThe bipartisan budget agreement that was made last year has been completely ignored. Not only do these bills increase deficit spending, they include reckless partisan language,\u201d said Rep. Kay Granger of Texas, top Republican on the Appropriations panel. \u201cI hope that we can get back on track and send bills to the President that he can sign into law.\u201d___With no new law to curb drug costs, Trump tries own changesWASHINGTON \u2014 Unable to land the big deal with Congress to curb drug costs, President Donald Trump on Friday moved on his own to allow imports of cheaper medicines, along with other limited steps that could have some election-year appeal.At a White House ceremony, Trump signed four executive orders. One was about importation. The others would direct drugmaker rebates straight to patients, provide insulin and EpiPens at steep discounts to low-income people, and use lower international prices to pay for some Medicare drugs.Trump cast his directives as far-reaching, but they mostly update earlier administration ideas that have not yet gone into effect.\u201cI\u2019m unrigging the system that is many decades old,\u201d he declared, promising \u201cmassive\u201d savings.Consumers may not notice immediate changes, since the orders must be carried out by the federal bureaucracy and could face court challenges.___NOT REAL NEWS: A look at what didn\u2019t happen this weekA roundup of some of the most popular but completely untrue stories and visuals of the week. None of these are legit, even though they were shared widely on social media. The Associated Press checked them out. Here are the facts:___CLAIM: There is no coin shortage. Coins get recirculated, they don\u2019t just disappear. The government is trying to usher in a cashless society.THE FACTS: Not so, says The Federal Reserve, which manages the country\u2019s coin inventory. Coins aren\u2019t being circulated because businesses are closed and sales are down during the pandemic. And the government isn\u2019t pushing the U.S. into a cashless society, either. The U.S. Mint is actively producing more coins to alleviate the short supply. Despite that, posts circulating widely on Facebook are suggesting that the shortage of coins in the U.S. is a hoax because it doesn\u2019t make sense for the currency to have \u201cdisappeared.\u201d The posts suggest a larger conspiracy is at play to usher us all into a \u201ccashless\u201d era. The Federal Reserve has explained that the supply chain is severely disrupted by the pandemic. \u201cWith establishments like retail shops, bank branches, transit authorities and laundromats closed, the typical places where coin enters our society have slowed or even stopped the normal circulation of coin,\u201d the Federal Reserve said in a June statement. The Federal Reserve has asked banks to only order the coins they need and to make depositing coins easy for customers. It also put together a task force of retail, bank and armored cash carrier leaders to brainstorm ways to normalize coin circulation again. The U.S. Mint, meanwhile, is moving at full speed to mint more coins, while minimizing its employees risk to COVID-19 exposure, the agency\u2019s spokesman Michael White told The Associated Press in an email. The Mint produced nearly 1.6 billion coins last month, White said, and is on track to average about 1.65 billion per month for the rest of the year. That\u2019s up from an average of 1 billion coins per month last year, he added.______At 88, former Sheriff Joe Arpaio makes 2nd comeback bidPHOENIX \u2014 Joe Arpaio is trying to win back the sheriff\u2019s post in metro Phoenix that he held for 24 years, facing his former second-in-command in the Aug. 4 Republican primary in what has become his second comeback bid.The 88-year-old lawman, who was unseated in the 2016 sheriff\u2019s race by a Democratic challenger and was trounced in a 2018 U.S. Senate race, has based much of his campaign around his support for President Donald Trump.He has vowed to bring back things that the courts have either deemed illegal or his successor has done away with \u2014 immigration crackdowns, a complex of jail tents and other now-discarded trademarks.\u201cI\u2019m telling you right now: I am going to do 90% of what I did during my 24 years,\u201d Arpaio said. \u201cThat\u2019s the way it\u2019s going to be.\u201dArpaio and his former second-in-command, Jerry Sheridan, are considered front-runners in GOP primary.

Fauci \u2014 the nation\u2019s top infectious-disease expert, whom Trump and his allies have frequently sought to undermine \u2014 was the mastermind behind a plot to create the coronavirus and export it to China.Sinclair and Bolling initially defended the segment, which briefly streamed on some of its stations\u2019 websites. It featured an interview with Judy Mikovits, star of a debunked video called \u201cThe Plandemic\u201d that was banned by Facebook and YouTube for spreading misinformation.  \u201cDid Dr. Fauci create Covid-19?\u201d read an on-screen graphic.ADADAmid growing outrage, the company pulled it from its broadcast lineup, and Bolling said it would be \u201creworked.\u201d Sinclair eventually decided to drop it altogether.Sinclair, based in the Baltimore suburb of Hunt Valley, has repeatedly defended the independence and objectivity of the local news reporting that is carried on its many stations. But its nationally distributed news and commentary programs, produced in Washington, have periodically been embroiled in controversy for their perceived Trump-friendly bias.Following the 2016 presidential campaign, Trump\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, boasted about an agreement with Sinclair that gave the company\u2019s stations special access. (Sinclair said it offered the same terms to Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign but was rejected.) In 2017, the company hired former Trump aide Boris Epshteyn as its national political commentator; he has since returned to the Trump campaign.ADADSeveral of Sinclair\u2019s hosts and reporters, such as Bolling and journalist James Rosen, were former stars at Fox News. Sinclair also carries a program hosted by former Fox News host Bill O\u2019Reilly on its streaming platform, Stirr.In this town, you can flip the channel all you want \u2014 the news is often the sameSinclair attracted unwelcome attention early last year when an eerie compilation video of its many news anchors from across the country reading the same promotional script went viral. Sinclair said it was merely highlighting its commitment to accurate reporting; critics said its reference to \u201cfake news\u201d was an effort to boost Trump\u2019s attacks on the news media.The pattern has suggested that the company, controlled by the heirs of founder Julian Sinclair Smith, has harnessed its station group as a political vehicle. \u201cTheir purpose seems to be to [promote] Donald Trump and far-right opinion,\u201d said Lewis Friedland, a journalism professor at the University of Wisconsin.In a statement, Sinclair\u2019s representatives drew a distinction between its local newscasts and the opinion programming it produces.\u201cIt is important to note that [Bolling\u2019s show] \u2018America This Week\u2019 is a political talk show that aims to bring together a diverse set of viewpoints and that the views of the guests and the host are their own, and not Sinclair\u2019s,\u201d said Michael Padovano, a company spokesman. \u201cWe are always looking for interesting topics and guests, and some guests come with views that are not popular. As it relates to the segment featuring Dr. Mikovits we reviewed it further and determined it to be inappropriate to air.\u201dADADIn a text exchange this week, Attkisson also defended her work. \u201cAs I reported, there are two divergent views of [hydroxychloroquine] that have tended to fall along political lines, and the jury is still out,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThis is in contrast to widespread reports that stated or implied the scientific case on hydroxychloroquine as a potential treatment or preventive measure had been closed, even as multiple studies on it \u2014 including by the government \u2014 were actively underway.\u201dShe added: \u201cIronically, powerful interests are able to successfully direct media attention so that the scrutiny falls on the accurate reporting rather than the many false and misleading reports. .\u2009.\u2009. The idea that certain interests are working so hard to censor this information should be a red flag that leads all of us to ask why.\u201dAs it turns out, Sinclair\u2019s chief executive, Christopher Ripley, is a hydroxychloroquine enthusiast, who championed the drug in an April email to Sinclair employees.ADAD\u201cOn the good news front, there is a growing medical consensus (lack of large-scale tests aside) that hydroxychloroquine plus zinc and azithromycin is an effective treatment for the virus and is believed to materially impact patient outcomes,\u201d Ripley wrote. \u201cThese drugs have been around and widely used for decades so their side effects are minimal and well know[n], and production can be scaled quickly. It is my hope that every hospital in the country will make this a standard protocol and dramatically reduce the deaths that may occur in the weeks to come.\u201dWho is Judy Mikovits in \u2018Plandemic,\u2019 the coronavirus conspiracy video just banned from social media?Bolling \u2014 who landed an interview with Trump in early July \u2014 has echoed the president\u2019s urgency to \u201creopen\u201d the economy during the pandemic and has amplified Trump\u2019s concerns about the potential for fraud with mail-in balloting, despite scant evidence of it.During an interview in July with Sam Reed, a former Republican secretary of state in Washington state, Bolling asked, \u201cTell us about the fraud that could happen.\u201d He later asked, \u201cSo do you not see the opportunity for fraud with mail-in voting?\u201d Reed replied that voting by mail \u201cis a very good system,\u201d if the state prepares for it. \u201cWe haven\u2019t really had any problems.\u201dADADIn a tweet in May, Bolling alluded to another conspiracy theory: that billionaire philanthropist George Soros has helped organize protests in the wake of George Floyd\u2019s death. He called George Soros the \u201cOG\u201d \u2014 a slang term meaning \u201coriginal gangster\u201d \u2014 of \u201corganizing and financing riots, looting and civil unrest\u201d \u2014 an unfounded statement with anti-Semitic overtones. Soros, who is Jewish, has been accused without evidence by authoritarian governments around the world with fomenting unrest.According to tracking by Media Matters, the liberal watchdog group, Bolling has repeatedly raised the discredited notion that the coronavirus was engineered by Chinese scientists as a biological weapon. In late April, he interviewed former Trump adviser Stephen K. Bannon, who offered just such a conspiratorial view without challenge from Bolling. During the same program, Rep. Michael McCaul (R-Tex.), told Bolling he was \u201cconcerned\u201d about the bioweapons claim, based on classified briefings.Bolling initially agreed to an interview for this story, but then declined.ADADIn addition to Trump himself, top administration officials and Trump supporters have been regular guests on Bolling\u2019s program over the past two months. The guest list includes Vice President Pence, senior adviser Kellyanne Conway, acting deputy secretary of Homeland Security Ken Cuccinelli and White House officials Peter Navarro and Ja\u2019Ron Smith. Others include Trump campaign spokesman Hogan Gidley, Trump lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani and Trump loyalists Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) and Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.). Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson has appeared twice.Sinclair countered that Bolling interviewed several Democratic primary candidates in the early months of the campaign.\u201cSinclair is terrific, I have to say,\u201d Trump said during his July interview with Bolling, the second he has granted to Bolling since October.ADADFor some of those who\u2019ve worked for Sinclair, the conservative slant is familiar. Station news managers were used to receiving  \u201cmust-run\u201d directives from headquarters for Epshteyn\u2019s commentaries; they say they still receive daily news reports that favor Trump\u2019s position or attack his critics.\u201cSinclair has always wanted to be Fox News-plus,\u201d said Israel Balderas, a former anchor and reporter for a Sinclair-owned station in Florida and a former segment producer at Fox News. \u201cWell, if it walks like a duck and talks like a duck .\u2009.\u2009.\u201dBalderas, now a journalism professor, added, \u201cTime and time again, [their] message seems to be, \u2018Trump isn\u2019t responsible [for the response to the pandemic] and he\u2019s not to blame.\u2019 They\u2019re in the business of making excuses for him.\u201d\n\n", "comment": "172 Comments", "topic": "Media"}, {"cover": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/SRWSU6WHSEI6VKBFQ4RAATSBKA.jpghttps://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/SRWSU6WHSEI6VKBFQ4RAATSBKA.jpg", "title": "The crisis that shocked the world: America\u2019s response to the coronavirus", "date": "Jul 19, 2020", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/07/19/coronavirus-us-failure/", "keyword": "China and Security", "website": "the Washington Post", "author": "Joel AchenbachWilliam WanKarin BrulliardChelsea Janes", "content": "Isabelle Papadimitriou, 64, a respiratory therapist in Dallas, had been treating a surge of patients as the Texas economy reopened.

Now, she wonders whether she\u2019ll ever be able to celebrate it again. In mourning, she\u2019s furious.Tulip, 40, had seen her country fail to control the novel coronavirus. She had seen Texas ease restrictions even as case counts and hospitalizations soared. She had seen fellow citizens refuse to wear masks or engage in social distancing.\u201cI feel like her death was a hundred percent preventable. I\u2019m angry at the Trump administration. I\u2019m angry with the state of our politics. I\u2019m angry at the people who even now refuse to wear masks,\u201d she said.ADADSix months after the coronavirus appeared in America, the nation has failed spectacularly to contain it. The country\u2019s ineffective response has shocked observers around the planet.Many countries have rigorously driven infection rates nearly to zero. In the United States, coronavirus transmission is out of control. The national response is fragmented, shot through with political rancor and culture-war divisiveness. Testing shortcomings that revealed themselves in March have become acute in July, with week-long waits for results leaving the country blind to real-time virus spread and rendering contact tracing nearly irrelevant.Stay safe and informed with our free Coronavirus Updates newsletterThe United States may be heading toward a new spasm of wrenching economic shutdowns or to another massive spike in preventable deaths from covid-19 \u2014 or both.ADHow the world\u2019s richest country got into this dismal situation is a complicated tale that exposes the flaws and fissures in a nation long proud of its ability to meet cataclysmic challenges.ADThe fumbling of the virus was not a fluke: The American coronavirus fiasco has exposed the country\u2019s incoherent leadership, self-defeating political polarization, a lack of investment in public health, and persistent socioeconomic and racial inequities that have left millions of people vulnerable to disease and death.In this big, sprawling, demographically and culturally diverse nation, the decentralized political structures gave birth to patchwork policies that don\u2019t make sense when applied to a virus that ignores state boundaries and city limits.ADWhile other countries endured some of the same setbacks, few have suffered from all of them simultaneously and catastrophically. If there was a mistake to be made in this pandemic, America has made it.The single biggest miscalculation was rushing to reopen the economy while the virus was still spreading at high rates through much of the country, experts say. The only way to reopen safely, epidemiologists said as far back as early April, was to \u201ccrush the curve\u201d \u2014 to drive down the rate of viral transmission to the point that new infections were few and far between.Many countries did just that. The United States did not follow the expert advice. Now, the curve is crushing America.ADAD\u201cWe didn\u2019t have the stick-to-itiveness, the determination, to carry through what we started in March, April and May, and now the virus is taking advantage of that,\u201d National Institutes of Health Director Francis Collins said.\u201cIf we\u2019d had really strong guidance from local, state and national leaders, maybe we could have sustained the determination to get the curve all the way down to zero,\u201d he said. \u201cNow, we\u2019re on the upswing, and I don\u2019t quite see the top of the upswing yet.\u201dAmerica, the outlierOther countries have managed to avoid the kind of dramatic viral resurgence that is happening in America. Spain, Italy, Germany and France \u2014 all devastated by the virus months ago \u2014 drove coronavirus cases and deaths to relatively low levels. The United Kingdom has been an outlier in Europe, with one of the highest per capita death tolls in the world, but after suppressing transmission, it has not seen a major rebound.And in Asia, the picture is radically different. In Taiwan, baseball fans sit in the stands and watch their teams play. Japan has had fewer than 1,000 deaths from covid-19, the illness caused by the coronavirus. South Korea has had fewer than 300. Vietnam has recorded no deaths from the virus.The death rate from covid-19 in the United States looks like that of countries with vastly lower wealth, health-care resources and technological infrastructure.America\u2019s mishandling of the pandemic has defied most experts\u2019 predictions. In October, not long before the novel coronavirus began sickening people in China, a comprehensive review ranked the pandemic preparedness of 195 countries. The project \u2014 called the Global Health Security Index and spearheaded by the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security and the Nuclear Threat Initiative \u2014 assigned scores to countries as a way to warn them of the rising threat of infectious-disease outbreaks.ADADWith a score of 83.5 out of 100, the United States ranked No. 1.How did the nation get caught so flat-footed? By not really trying, said Beth Cameron, who helped lead the project for the Nuclear Threat Initiative.The federal government punted the coronavirus response to the states, counties and cities, said Cameron, who was senior director for global health security and biodefense on the White House National Security Council and helped write a pandemic response plan under President Barack Obama. The team Cameron led was disbanded after Donald Trump took office. The White House says positions on the disbanded team were absorbed into another office.AD\u201cI just never expected that we would have such a lack of federal leadership, and it\u2019s been deliberate,\u201d she said. \u201cIn a national emergency that is a pandemic, spreading between states, federal leadership is essential. And if there was any doubt about that, we ran that experiment from March and April until now. It failed. So we have to run a different experiment.\u201dA nation of individualsSomehow, this highly mobile virus keeps sneaking up on communities, seeding itself extensively before people detect the breadth and intensity of the attack. That happened catastrophically in New York City early in the pandemic. The new outbreaks have been largely in the South and West.ADADThis month, Roy Ramos, a reporter for WPLG-TV in Miami, noticed he had a cough. He and his wife, the station\u2019s evening news anchor, Nicole Perez, went to get tested for the coronavirus. Positive \u2014 both of them. Soon, another anchor and the station\u2019s chief meteorologist had tested positive, too.As of July 14, 10 station employees had tested positive, including some who hadn\u2019t even been in the office or in contact with their co-workers. The virus was everywhere in South Florida, which is now reeling from the pathogen\u2019s assault.\u201cThis is not a political message, but a personal one,\u201d Perez\u2019s co-anchor, Calvin Hughes, told viewers. \u201cPlease, please wear a mask.\u201dIn the minds of many Americans, the coronavirus crisis that was so alarming in March and April lost its fearsomeness in May and June, when people tried to resume something approximating a normal life. The shutdowns had been miserable, but they\u2019d been effective.ADADThe success of the shutdowns meant that many Americans didn\u2019t know anyone personally sickened by the virus. In places with low transmission, the crisis seemed far away.\u201cWe just let our guard down,\u201d Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine (R) said in an interview Friday. \u201cSome people when they heard, \u2018Hey, Ohio\u2019s open,\u2019 what they mentally processed is, \u2018It\u2019s safe. We can go out and do whatever we want to. It\u2019s back to normal.\u2019 \u201dIn the past two months, the virus has been smoldering in his state, the governor said, and \u201cnow we start to see some flames.\u201d He fears Ohio could soon have the kind of runaway transmission afflicting Florida.\u201cFlorida a month ago is where Ohio is today. If we don\u2019t want to be Florida, we\u2019ve got to change what we\u2019re doing. Everybody\u2019s got to mask up,\u201d the governor said.He and others cite human nature as a problem with containing the virus. Human brains simply aren\u2019t wired to emphasize the importance of doing things, like wearing masks, that protect others but offer no immediate payoff, said Paul Slovic, a University of Oregon psychologist.AD\u201cYou don\u2019t get rewarded for putting on a mask,\u201d Slovic said. \u201cYou don\u2019t see who you\u2019ve protected from harm, but you do feel an immediate discomfort.\u201dProtecting one life \u2014 or even one small puppy \u2014 generates a major emotional response that can prompt action, Slovic has found. But as the number of individuals involved increases \u2014 say, to the 137,000-plus deaths caused by the coronavirus \u2014 people grow inured to the loss, less prone to take action.That makes public messaging especially essential, experts say. But the messaging in the United States has been all over the place. Even the scientists have struggled: They were wobbly on the effectiveness of masks before eventually embracing them.Kristin Urquiza, 39, said she tried warning her father, Mark \u2014 a lifelong Republican \u2014 against going out and risking infection. In their home state of Arizona, as leaders including Gov. Doug Ducey (R) sprinted to reopen in May and June, Urquiza could tell she was losing the argument.\u201cWhen the president, the governor and people on cable news are all saying one thing, how do you compete with that?\u201d she said. \u201cHe would push back. \u2018I hear what you\u2019re saying, but why would the governor say it\u2019s safe to go out if it\u2019s not true?\u2019 \u201dADHer father died of the virus June 30. In the obituary she wrote, she lashed out at government leaders.\u201cHe was a huge supporter of Trump and Arizona governor Ducey. He believed what they said. And they betrayed him,\u201d she said in an interview.When there\u2019s no cavalry to sendEven before the pandemic hit, local public health agencies had been decimated by years of staffing and budget cuts.They had lost almost a quarter of their overall workforce since 2008 \u2014 a cut of almost 60,000 workers, according to national associations of health officials. The agencies\u2019 main source of federal funding \u2014 the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s emergency preparedness budget \u2014 had been cut 30 percent since 2003.Public health is an enterprise with an intrinsic problem: People can\u2019t see sicknesses avoided or deaths averted.\u201cYou don\u2019t see the results. It\u2019s a dog that doesn\u2019t bark,\u201d said David Himmelstein, professor of public health and health policy at the CUNY School of Public Health.\u201cThe question is, does the water come out of your tap clean? Are the sewer systems being inspected? Are restaurants and food being inspected? Those things, you don\u2019t notice until they fail,\u201d he said.The country\u2019s electronic disease surveillance systems are \u201carchaic and cumbersome,\u201d said Cathy Slemp, who was recently dismissed as West Virginia\u2019s public health commissioner after the governor blamed her for failing to reclassify certain coronavirus cases as recovered.\u201cWe\u2019re driving a Pinto and want to have a Ferrari,\u201d she said.The public health challenges are keenly felt in Malheur County, a vast swath of mostly federal rangeland in rural eastern Oregon. About a quarter of its 30,000 residents live in poverty. Teen pregnancy rates are double the statewide rate. There\u2019s one school nurse for 10,000 square miles. Drug use is high.The first coronavirus case hit March 30, and for more than a month, the county averaged just one to two cases a week. There was resistance to a statewide shutdown in the conservative area, but most people were willing to observe temporary restrictions, said Sarah Poe, director of the county health department.But after a month or so, residents began to complain of government overreach. Many felt they had to resume working to survive, she said.\u201cPeople\u2019s response has been to just take care of themselves, take care of your own business, your own family,\u201d Poe said. \u201cThat\u2019s not how this virus works.\u201dNow, the coronavirus is a full-blown crisis in Malheur County. Cases began soaring three weeks ago, to 15 or 16 a day. As of Friday, the county had 477 cases. The cumulative positive rate since the first case is nearly 16 percent \u2014 quadruple the state\u2019s rate.On Wednesday, facing an accelerating caseload, Malheur County commissioners passed a resolution that goes further than the state\u2019s mask order. It recommends gatherings of no more than 10 people indoors and 25 outdoors, and mask-wearing in groups indoors and out.But resistance in the county remains high. Poe said she regularly gets hate mail and phone calls accusing her of peddling a hoax.\u201cWe\u2019re up against just a ton of misinformation,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat are we fighting here? We are fighting a virus and our goal is to save lives. Let\u2019s not be distracted into fighting other people.\u201dA turning pointAmerica, experts say, is approaching a tipping point at which its public health systems could become so overwhelmed they begin to collapse. Already, coronavirus test results take so long to come back they are almost useless for anything except as a historical record.The delays have a cascading effect. Contact tracing is rendered ineffectual. Containing the virus by isolation becomes impossible. And as hospitals fill, the virus\u2019s fatality rate could inch upward because of overtaxed ICU nurses and doctors struggling to care for so many.But the most dangerous cascading effect could be despair \u2014 a loss of hope, along with the resolve to fight the virus, warned Michael T. Osterholm, director of the University of Minnesota\u2019s Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy.\u201cWhen that happens, you lose the ability to act rationally. You lose the commitment to fight. You lose all chance of beating back the virus,\u201d he said.Adam Fleming Petty, a writer in Grand Rapids, Mich., said he feels that demoralization acutely \u2014 as well as \u201cso much rage\u201d at Trump and other political leaders whose measures did not quell the virus enough to allow many schools to open.\u201cOne thing I told myself was, \u2018Okay, as long as school starts back up in the fall, I can do this. I can make it through the summer if I have that goal waiting for me.\u2019 Now, that goal isn\u2019t there anymore,\u201d said Petty, 38, who has been the primary supervisor of two daughters, ages 5 and 7, while his wife works from home. For four months, the family has socialized with only a handful of relatives just a few times.\u201cThis is far from the first time that governmental administrative incompetence has been displayed. But I can\u2019t remember the last time that the consequences of that were so personal,\u201d Petty said.Governors and local officials across the Sun Belt have announced incremental measures in recent days to halt the viral resurgence. California instituted a statewide mask requirement. Arkansas and Colorado did so Thursday. Arizona allowed local jurisdictions to implement mask mandates as they see fit.Florida\u2019s governor has resisted weeks of calls to implement such a mandate. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp (R) announced Wednesday that all local mask mandates in his state are void.Louisiana and Texas recently shut down bars all over again. Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey (R) announced a statewide mask mandate in recent days as an alternative to closing. West Virginia limited gatherings to 25 people or fewer.In New York, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo (D) threatened to close restaurants if social distancing is not taken seriously.\u201cClosing the bars is going to be the equivalent of fixing three of the five screen doors in your submarine,\u201d said Osterholm, who says that places with high levels of transmission need to return to the kind of shutdowns common in March and April.In a telephone interview, Cuomo said New York officials were caught off guard early in the year because everyone assumed the virus was coming into the West Coast from China. But it had already spread in Europe, and from there to New York.\u201cWe didn\u2019t find out until after the fact. You don\u2019t have the revelation by the academics until mid-March that this was one of the great health blunders of all time,\u201d Cuomo said. \u201cYou actually got hit by a bus that came from the other direction.\u201dHe expressed dismay about the national failure to suppress the virus.\u201cIf you could have written a prescription four months ago, a manual \u2014 \u2018This is what you must do to deal with a virus\u2019 \u2014 and if people could just follow the manual, we would be over this, like other countries are over it,\u201d Cuomo said. \u201cI think it exposed a fundamental weakness in this country. We have a divided country.\u201dNew York beat back the virus by closely following the scientific data and being cautious about reopening the economy, Cuomo said. Many places suffering high rates of infections didn\u2019t do that, he said.\u201cIt was science denial meets government incompetence,\u201d he said.\u2018The exception and anomaly\u2019This crisis has been sucked inexorably into the vortex of political polarization.Trump repeatedly downplayed the viral threat. \u201cYou have 15 people, and the 15 within a couple of days is going to be down to close to zero,\u201d he said in late February. On Twitter, he cheered on citizen protests of shutdowns that had been ordered by Democratic governors. He did not wear a mask in public until July 11.White House spokeswoman Sarah Matthews in a statement defended the administration\u2019s response to the crisis, saying Trump \u201chas led an historic, whole-of-America coronavirus response \u2014 resulting in 100,000 ventilators procured, sourcing critical PPE for our frontline heroes, and a robust testing regime resulting in more than double the number of tests than any other country in the world. \u2026 This strong leadership will continue as we safely reopen the economy, expedite vaccine and therapeutics developments, and continue to see an encouraging decline in the U.S. mortality rate.\u201dA White House official on background defended the president\u2019s support for reopening the economy while the virus was still spreading, citing Trump\u2019s belief that the cure cannot be worse than the disease: \u201cThere are consequences to staying closed, including but not limited to missed doctors\u2019 appointments, drug or alcohol misuse, and suicide as a result of the pandemic.\u201dFuture historians will not treat kindly Trump\u2019s efforts to divide and confuse, said James Grossman, executive director of the American Historical Association.\u201cYou look at the Great Depression and how Roosevelt made a concerted effort to unite the country \u2014 the fireside chats, the New Deal. That is the instinctive reaction of almost every president in crisis. Even if you don\u2019t succeed, you try to convince people that they\u2019re all in this together,\u201d Grossman said. \u201cThis presidency is the exception and anomaly.\u201dMany Americans now believe the pandemic has been exaggerated, or even fabricated, by scientists and the mainstream news media. The rejection of scientific expertise has flowered into a conspiracy theory holding that the experts are lying as part of a political agenda.\u201cThe most outrageous lies are the ones about Covid 19. Everyone is lying. The CDC, Media, Democrats, our Doctors, not all but most, that we are told to trust,\u201d former \u201cWheel of Fortune\u201d game show host Chuck Woolery tweeted July 12.Trump retweeted that. Days later, Woolery revealed his son was sick with the virus, and he has since taken down his Twitter account.To be an AmericanAs she prepares for a three-day drive across the country \u2014 from New York to Texas \u2014 to bury her mother, Tulip said she has been thinking a lot about what it means to be American.She was raised like many Texans, unabashedly proud of her roots and her patriotism. \u201cI grew up a Dallas Cowboys fan.

Instead, it has spurred investigations around the world into deal-making, election spending and political patronage under former Prime Minister Najib Razak. The figures are mind-boggling: Of the $8 billion that 1MDB raised via bond sales, the U.S. alleges more than half was siphoned off. Angry voters ousted Najib in a 2018 election that ended his party\u2019s 61 years of rule, and a series of trials is underway. U.S. prosecutors have implicated at least three senior bankers from Goldman Sachs Group Inc., one of whom admitted to bribery. Malaysia, which had filed its own charges, reached a $3.9 billion settlement with the bank.Support our journalism. Subscribe today.arrow-right1. What is 1MDB?ADADIt\u2019s a government investment company -- full name, 1Malaysia Development Bhd -- that took shape in 2009 under Najib, who led its advisory board. Its early initiatives included buying privately owned power plants and planning a new financial district in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia\u2019s capital. The fund proved better at borrowing -- it accumulated $12 billion in debt -- than at luring large-scale foreign investment.2. What\u2019s the issue?Much of the money raised was allegedly embezzled. The U.S. Justice Department says more than $4.5 billion flowed from the fund through fraudulent shell companies to corrupt officials and their associates. According to the U.S. indictment, a small coterie of Malaysians, led by businessman Low Taek Jho (known as Jho Low), diverted money from 1MDB into personal accounts disguised to look like legitimate businesses, and kicked back some of those funds to officials. There were questions about a $681 million payment that landed in Najib\u2019s personal bank account. Malaysia\u2019s then-attorney general cleared Najib of wrongdoing in 2016. But after losing office, Najib was charged with 42 counts of corruption, breach of trust and money laundering. He has pleaded not guilty and said most of the $681 million was returned. That and other proceedings are ongoing. Jho Low, a fugitive, has also denied any wrongdoing.ADAD3. Where\u2019s the money?Scattered, but slowly coming in. Under the July 24 settlement, Malaysia will drop all criminal charges against Goldman in exchange for a $2.5 billion cash payment and at least $1.4 billion from seized 1MDB assets being returned with the help of U.S. prosecutors and Goldman. (Goldman made $593 million working on three bond sales that raised $6.5 billion for 1MDB in 2012 and 2013 -- far more than what banks typically make from such deals.) An agreement to settle the U.S. charges with a possible $2 billion penalty was said to be awaiting a Justice Department decision on whether Goldman would have to accept its first-ever guilty plea. In addition:\u2022 U.S. prosecutors struck a deal in October with Jho Low to recoup almost $700 million worth of assets, including a Beverly Hills hotel and real estate in New York and London. That\u2019s in addition to $260 million of assets, including a $126 million super yacht, seized earlier on Malaysia\u2019s behalf.ADAD\u2022 The U.S. reached a $60 million settlement with the producers of \u201cThe Wolf of Wall Street,\u201d a 2013 movie allegedly funded with siphoned money. The production company was co-founded by Riza Aziz, Najib\u2019s stepson and a friend of Jho Low.\u2022 Malaysia is moving to seize $340 million in PetroSaudi International\u2019s accounts in London.\u2022 Singapore is returning S$35 million ($25 million) forfeited by former Goldman banker Roger Ng.4. Who\u2019s investigating?The U.S. Justice Department has been at the forefront of 1MDB investigations, focusing on bribery, theft and money laundering. According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, some potential witnesses were scared to talk because they feared retaliation. Several other countries also conducted probes. Singapore and Switzerland have fined some banks for lapses in anti-money laundering controls. Malaysia also has said it is looking into allegations that China offered to help fend off probes into 1MDB in the U.S. and elsewhere in exchange for stakes in infrastructure projects in Malaysia. A former Najib aide testified that the ex-premier offered projects to China in return for help resolving 1MDB\u2019s debt.ADAD5. Who else is charged?\u2022 Jho Low, a bon vivant who said he did consulting work for 1MDB, is portrayed by U.S. prosecutors as the central figure who set up shell companies to collect proceeds from the fund and arranged withdrawals for payoffs and for his own lavish spending. He has been charged in absentia in Malaysia and the U.S. with money laundering and other offenses. Malaysian police have bemoaned the lack of help from other jurisdictions in finding him, after saying they had located him and were in talks with a party they suspect of protecting him. Jho Low\u2019s settlement with the U.S. didn\u2019t include an admission of guilt or release him from criminal charges.\u2022 Goldman\u2019s former Southeast Asia Chairman Tim Leissner pleaded guilty to U.S. charges including conspiracy to launder money and admitted to bribing officials in Malaysia and the United Arab Emirates to get bond deals for Goldman. He agreed to forfeit $43.7 million and was scheduled to be sentenced on Jan. 22, 2021.ADAD\u2022 Ng was extradited from Malaysia to the U.S. to face similar charges. His trial start date was postponed until January 2021 by the coronavirus outbreak. (The U.S. Federal Reserve has banned both men from the financial industry.)\u2022 Malaysia leveled charges of securities law violations against Leissner, Ng, Jho Low and 1MDB\u2019s former general counsel, Jasmine Loo Ai Swan.\u2022 PetroSaudi International directors Tarek Obaid and Patrick Mahony were charged by Malaysia in absentia in 2020 for allegedly receiving $300 million from 1MDB through unlawful activity. In 2018, Swiss federal prosecutors opened proceedings to investigate two officials of the Saudi oil producer, without confirming their identities.AD\u2022 Ex-1MDB President Arul Kanda was charged along with Najib for allegedly tampering with a state audit report into the fund. Both men have denied wrongdoing.AD\u2022 Rosmah Mansor, Najib\u2019s wife, was charged with money laundering and tax evasion. Luxury items and cash seized from properties linked to the former first couple were valued at about 1.1 billion ringgit ($259 million). According to U.S. prosecutors, Jho Low in 2013 allegedly funneled $27.3 million that was looted from 1MDB to a New York jeweler who designed a pink diamond necklace for her.6. What\u2019s still brewing?The U.S. investigation, and whether it will force Goldman to take a guilty plea, is one of the biggest issues remaining. Prosecutors assert that beyond Leissner, some employees at Goldman knew about a bribery scheme but worked to hide it from the firm\u2019s compliance and legal departments. Singapore was said to have expanded a criminal probe to include Goldman; two Abu Dhabi funds have filed a civil suit against Goldman in New York seeking damages for alleged fraud in connection with embezzlement at 1MDB; and a Justice Department employee has pleaded guilty to funneling money into the U.S. to pay for a lobbying effort to influence the 1MDB probe, with the filing identifying the fund\u2019s source as Jho Low. In another twist, the U.S. was said to be investigating Deutsche Bank AG over a former Goldman executive who joined the German bank.ADAD7. Exactly how much money is involved?In all, 1MDB raised more than $8 billion in bond sales and accumulated billions more in debt through loans and interest payments. Swiss investigators say about $7 billion of 1MDB funds passed into the global financial system from 2009 to 2015. They\u2019re still assessing how much was misappropriated; the U.S. estimates more than half. Some 1MDB projects are going ahead under the new government, including the plan for a new financial district and a $34 billion property and transport hub. As for 1MDB, it has been reduced to a shell after the finance ministry took over its assets and debt.8. Why does it matter?Authorities in Asia, the U.S. and Europe have been working to coordinate their investigations into the money trail from 1MDB, as well as legal approaches toward Goldman and asset recovery. Their findings could potentially identify, and help close, loopholes in the global financial system that open the way for corruption.ADAD9. Who else is involved?\u2022 The Fed banned ex-Goldman banker Andrea Vella from the financial industry for life, saying the former co-head of investment banking in Asia engaged in \u201cunsafe and unsound practices\u201d by failing to ensure all of Goldman\u2019s internal committees were aware that the 1MDB bond deals involved Jho Low.\u2022 Switzerland\u2019s Office of the Attorney-General continues to investigate six people on suspicion of criminal mismanagement, bribery and money laundering related to the case. The top Swiss prosecutors have also opened criminal proceedings against two Swiss banks, Falcon Private Bank Ltd. and BSI SA, for \u201corganizational deficiencies that may have permitted the commission of offenses currently being investigated.\u201d\u2022 Zurich-based Falcon, linked to $3.8 billion of 1MDB fund flows, was ordered to cease operations in Singapore, and Switzerland has threatened to withdraw its license if there were any further breaches of money-laundering regulations.\u2022 Switzerland\u2019s financial regulator said it would review JPMorgan Chase & Co.\u2019s anti-money laundering controls after finding the bank seriously breached regulations in its dealings with 1MDB.\u2022 BSI lost its license to do business in Singapore for breaches of money laundering rules.\u2022 Malaysia central bank governor Muhammad Ibrahim resigned in 2018 amid questions over the role the monetary authority played in a land-purchase deal linked to 1MDB. The monetary authority set up a review of the deal.\u2022 UBS Group, DBS Group, Credit Suisse, United Overseas Bank and Standard Chartered are among those that have drawn penalties from the Singapore central bank for anti-money laundering lapses. They said they will strengthen controls in their businesses.\u2022 Singapore has banned at least eight financial professionals in connection with 1MDB.\u2022 Singapore authorities have interviewed Tan Boon-Kee, Deutsche Bank\u2019s former Asia Pacific head of financial institutions group, about the extent of her involvement with the 1MDB account.

In every case, he saw the same thing: Their blood was starved of oxygen.Support our journalism. Subscribe today.arrow-rightOne day an idea hit him: Could hyperbaric oxygen therapy, best known for treating divers with the bends, help stave off the need for ventilators and perhaps reduce deaths?Physiologically it made sense to him, but he soon learned it was also complicated. The therapy, which involves delivering 100% oxygen straight to patients inside a pressurized chamber, is often met with skepticism by the wider medical community because fringe supporters have long touted it as a virtual cure-all without scientific evidence.ADADSo much so that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration wrote a consumer update a few years ago, explaining that the therapy is only approved for 13 types of treatment, ranging from burns to deep wounds and carbon monoxide poisoning. The agency warned patients not to be misled by claims on the Internet that it works for conditions such as cancer or autism.Still, with medical teams worldwide having little success at saving lives despite throwing everything they had at COVID patients \u2014 testing old drugs, trying new ones \u2014 Lee believed doctors should be more open to exploring different types of treatments. He brought his theory to Dr. Scott Gorenstein, a colleague at NYU Winthrop Hospital on Long Island with a decade of experience in the field.Though the treatment is non-invasive, with a long history of safety, both men knew they faced major obstacles. Chief among them: finding funding, and overcoming skepticism about the treatment fueled by hyperbaric spas as well as videos of celebrities like Justin Bieber and LeBron James using portable chambers.ADAD\u201cIf we were to promote hyperbaric without a rigorous scientific trial, because of the fringe community that\u2019s already doing that, the likelihood that it would be accepted by mainstream medical communities is close to zero,\u201d said Gorenstein.Within two weeks, the doctors had approval from an NYU institutional review board for a small, case-control trial that would allow them to compare COVID-19 patients treated with hyperbarics to a control group matched with similar characteristics, such as age, sex, health conditions and oxygen requirements, that did not get it.Twenty hyperbaric patients, predominantly men age 30 to 79, received up to five 90-minute treatments during the month-long study. Gorenstein said almost all experienced relief of symptoms once sealed inside the clear tube, similar in shape to the old iron lungs once used to treat polio. Some went from having unresponsive \u201cdeer-in-the-headlights\u201d dazes to being alert and engaged, while others reported being able to sleep afterward for the first time in days. Eighteen of those patients recovered and were discharged within days or weeks.ADADTwo people died, and the death of one of them halted the study and prompted a hospital safety assessment. It concluded hyperbaric treatment was not the cause, Lee said. The FDA also was asked to review the case, but he said there has not yet been a response.The control group saw a significantly higher rate of intubations, deaths, and long-term hospitalizations. However, both Gorenstein and Lee stressed that the trial, which will soon be published, was too small to draw any solid conclusions.\u201cWhat we\u2019ve been able to do, I think, is demonstrate that this therapy deserves to be studied in a large way,\u201d Gorenstein said, adding the next step would be to secure funding for a larger, randomized control trial at multiple centers.ADScientists remain baffled by the complex nature of COVID-19, its range of victims, its acute and long-haul symptoms, and even the accuracy of tests used to confirm infections. With more than 660,000 people succumbing globally \u2014 nearly a quarter of them in the U.S. \u2014 there\u2019s been little time for robust scientific studies in the race to find effective treatments.ADInitial fanfare over the old antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine and the anti-viral remdesivir quickly died down after it became clear neither was a silver bullet. There\u2019s also been excitement over steroids, experimental convalescent plasma, and even antibodies from a Belgian llama named Winter.What many of those treatments do have is financial backing from pharmaceutical companies, giving them an advantage over hyperbaric and other non-drug therapies. Oxygen, however, is not something that can be patented, and doctors say there are no big profits to be made from using the pressurized pods.ADOne of the biggest risks in hyperbarics is transporting patients to and from the chamber, given how sick they are and their absolute dependence on supplemental oxygen. There are also questions about how the treatment might affect blood-clotting disorders or if too much oxygen could lead to toxicity and, possibly, seizures.AD\u201cMy feeling about any kind of intervention, it\u2019s really important that that be done through clinical trials. If such data existed, then perfect, it\u2019s worth a try,\u201d said Mitchell Levy, medical director of the intensive care unit at Rhode Island Hospital and a professor of medicine at Brown University.\u201cBut we want to be really careful that we\u2019re not just acting out of desperation, giving things that may be harmful ... or spending a lot of money on ineffective therapies. And that\u2019s the challenge of entering this uncharted territory,\u201d Levy saidADThe treatment was first given to a handful of COVID-19 patients in Wuhan, China, with promising results. A study in Sweden plans to recruit 200 participants. Israel, France and Italy are among others trying it. It\u2019s also being tested out at several U.S. hospitals, including at the Opelousas General Health System in Louisiana.ADKathy Fuselier, 62, who works in the pharmacy there, said she felt it helped her. \u201cI didn\u2019t have to be put on the vent,\u201d she said. \u201cCame close, but didn\u2019t need the vent.\u201dWith a virus as mysterious and cunning as COVID, Lee said it\u2019s essential to raise questions. But he added it\u2019s just as important to keep an open mind.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of people trying to find solutions,\u201d he said, adding hyperbarics could just be one piece of a larger puzzle. \u201cThis is not going to be an end-all, be-all.\u201dCopyright 2020 The Associated Press.

But Washington had imposed strict restrictions on Seoul\u2019s use of solid propellant for space launch rockets out of concern that it could be used to produce bigger missiles and cause a regional arms race.On Tuesday, the South Korean government said that Seoul and Washington have agreed to revise related bilateral missile guidelines to lift such restrictions.ADKim Hyun-chong, deputy presidential national security adviser, told reporters that all South Korean research institutes, companies and individuals are now free to develop, produce and possess space launch rockets using solid fuel.ADKim said the revised agreement still bars South Korea from having a missile with a range of more than 800 kilometers (500 miles). But he said Seoul can discuss altering that restriction with Washington if it\u2019s needed for South Korean national security. A missile fired from South Korea with a maximum range of 800 kilometers is still enough to strike all of North Korea.Kim said that South Korea\u2019s intelligence and reconnaissance capability would be significantly improved when it produces and launches solid-fuel rockets to put low-earth orbit spy satellites into space. He said it makes more sense to use solid fuel rockets for such satellite launches because the price of solid propellant is only about one tenth of the price of liquid propellant.AD\u201cTheoretically, we can launch a low-earth orbit satellite via liquid-fuel rockets, but it\u2019s like delivering a dish of \u2018jjajangmyeon\u2019 by a 10-ton truck,\u201d he said, referring to a popular delivery food in South Korea.ADKim said South Korea has no military spy satellites while regional powers have dozens of them. He said the use of solid fuel rockets would help South Korea get an \u201cunblinking eye\u201d that monitors the Korean Peninsula around the clock.Lee Choon Geun, a missile expert at South Korea\u2019s Science and Technology Policy Institute, said South Korea could operate two or three low-earth orbit surveillance satellites to better monitor North Korea. He said solid propellants are easier to handle and require much less rocket launch times, though they have weaker thrust forces than high-quality liquid propellants.ADLee said the latest deals with the U.S. would also allow South Korea to expand its space development infrastructure and accumulate know-how to manufacture missiles that can fly longer with bigger warheads. Experts say ballistic missiles and rockets in satellite launches share similar bodies, engines and other technology.ADJung Changwook, head of the the private Korea Defense Study Forum, agreed that technology to produce solid-fuel rockets can also be used to build longer-range missiles. He said the United States likely agreed on the deals\u2019 revision to strengthen its alliance with South Korea to better cope with China.South Korea\u2019s missile capability is inferior to that of rival North Korea. In 2017, North Korea carried out three intercontinental ballistic missiles tests as part of its efforts to build a nuclear-tipped missile capable of reaching the U.S. mainland. In 2013, South Korea succeeded in thrusting an observational satellite into orbit aboard a rocket blasted from its soil for the first time, but parts of that rocket were built with Russian help.Copyright 2020 The Associated Press.

The fact that the United States and China are locked in an epic trade war may make it easier for a middle power from Africa to secure the head position. Here is what you need to know.Support our journalism. Subscribe today.arrow-rightChoosing a WTO head is highly politicalThe position of director general opened when Roberto Azev\u00eado, a Brazilian who serves in the post announced his decision to step down at the end of August, one year before his second WTO four-year term was set to expire. The nomination period for the position closed July 8, and three of the eight candidates are from Africa.Two of the leading candidates are African women: former Kenyan trade minister Amina Mohamed; and former Nigerian finance minister Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, who formerly served as managing director at the World Bank. The candidates have until Sept. 7 to \u201ccampaign\u201d and build support.The WTO is getting a new boss. Here\u2019s who\u2019s in the running.The WTO works through consensus, and the chair of its General Council leads the selection process. Neither gender nor nationality is an official requirement for being director general, but both matter unofficially. Only men have occupied the role since 1948, when the GATT (the WTO\u2019s predecessor) came into being. Until 2002, the directors general were European.Developing countries have pressed for more representationMy research shows how developing countries\u2019 collective advocacy and coalition-building in the post-colonial era won them a place at the GATT negotiating table, beginning with the multilateral Uruguay Round for trade from 1986 to 1994. Developing nations have criticized their developed neighbors for duplicity and paternalism in demanding the developing world open its markets while keeping their own closed \u2014 especially in textiles and agriculture, which were officially off the table until the Uruguay Round.ADADOver the 25 years since the GATT became the WTO, directors general from developing countries have led the organization for 10 years. A split in the consensus in 1999 led to three-year terms each for Mike Moore of New Zealand from 1999-2002, and Thailand\u2019s Supachai Panitchpakdi from 2002-2005. Azev\u00eado has been director general since 2013. Developed countries favored the Mexican candidate in 2013, but Azev\u00eado won.In general, it has become harder for developed countries to get behind a single candidate, not just because developing countries are unlikely to support them, but because developed countries can\u2019t agree among themselves. This year the European Union decided not to nominate its own candidate to avoid a dispute with the United States. The United Kingdom nominated former trade secretary Liam Fox, who served under Prime Minister Theresa May. Some analysts argue the nomination may be a way for the U.K. to fight for WTO rules and free trade after leaving the European Union. But Fox\u2019s pro-Brexit position has made the nomination the subject of ridicule inside and outside the U.K.How coronavirus changes the political outlook in China and the U.S.No candidate can survive concerted opposition from the United States and China, the two leading (and warring) trade powers. But these two powers will find it hard to agree on a DG candidate. Contenders such as Mexican negotiator Jes\u00fas Seade Kuri, who may be seen as too close to the United States, might be caught in the crossfire.Africa may have an openingDisagreement between the U.S. and China may open opportunities for candidates from Africa, some of whom have been quick to point out their ability to work across the U.S.-China trade conflict and introduce WTO reforms. In a recent BBC interview, Nigeria\u2019s Okonjo-Iweala acknowledged China\u2019s assistance to Africa while noting how important it was to listen to trade concerns and anxieties in the United States. Kenyan candidate Amina Mohamed chaired the 11th WTO ministerial meeting in Nairobi, mediating between China and the United States, and carving out an agriculture agreement on reducing export subsidies.ADADAfrican candidates also have strong credentials. Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, who beat another candidate from Nigeria for the nomination, was also a leading candidate to become World Bank president in 2012. She lost because the United States sees that position as its prerogative, while a European generally heads the International Monetary Fund. She is a Harvard and MIT-educated development economist who sits on the board of major corporations (including the global vaccine alliance GAVI), and has written and worked on reforming organizations.Kenya\u2019s Amina Mohamed, an ethnic Somali who was trained as a lawyer and in international relations, was Kenya\u2019s ambassador to the WTO and has chaired its major bodies: the General Council, the Dispute Settlement Body and the Trade Policy Review Body. She was the first woman to head the WTO\u2019s General Council.The WTO might return to diplomatic settlements for trade disputes. Here\u2019s why.Choosing a female African director general might help the WTO seem responsive to the protests about Black Lives Matter happening around the world, as well as criticisms that the WTO has historically excluded the Global South from its deliberations, and denied it benefits.ADADMiddle-sized powers like Switzerland and New Zealand have led GATT and the WTO for 28 years of its 72-year history and have been especially attractive candidates in periods when there was turbulence and disagreement among great powers. Now, the new middle powers for the WTO may be African.It may prove difficult for any potential WTO director general to win support in an era when the U.S. is explicitly threatening to leave the organization and when China fears the global trade system may be weaponized against it. Yet these disagreements may favor African candidates \u2014 if the ongoing bilateral conflict does not scupper the process altogether through its impact on the future of the WTO.The TMC newsletter has moved!

The Post sued in April  after the State Department failed to produce the records in the time period required by the law.ADADThe full cable does not strengthen the claim that an accident at the lab caused the virus to escape, nor does it exclude the possibility. However, in recent months, skepticism of the  accident theory has increased in the scientific community because the genetic sequences of isolates from the bat coronaviruses known to be under research at the lab do not match those of covid-19.The State Department cable says the lab, which U.S. officials visited in 2018, \u201chas a serious shortage of appropriately trained technicians and investigators needed to safely operate this high-containment laboratory.\u201dRead the State Department cable that launched claims that coronavirus escaped from Chinese labIt also says that scientists in the lab were allowed to study SARS-like coronaviruses isolated from bats but were precluded from studying human-disease-causing SARS coronaviruses in their lab unless given explicit permission from a designated commission.\u201cI don\u2019t see any evidence to support the idea that this was released deliberately or inadvertently,\u201d said Ian Lipkin, the director of the Center for Infection and Immunity at Columbia University, after The Post relayed the contents of the cable. \u201cYou can\u2019t just say someone is guilty of accidentally releasing a virus.

In May, it issued a statement saying intelligence officials were still examining whether the virus \u201cbegan through contact with infected animals or if it was the result of an accident at a laboratory in Wuhan.\u201dThe statement said the intelligence community \u201cconcurs with the wide scientific consensus that the COVID-19 virus was not man-made or genetically modified.\u201dADThe rare declaration by the intelligence community followed a report in the New York Times that Trump administration officials were pushing U.S. spy agencies to support the theory that the virus came from the lab in Wuhan.ADThe Trump administration has accused China and the World Health Organization of failing to contain the virus and warn the rest of the world about its lethality.More than 135,000 Americans have died of the coronavirus and nearly 3.7\u00a0million have contracted covid-19, which has forced businesses, schools and places of worship to close all around the world.Tom Inglesby, the director of the Center for Health Security at Johns Hopkins University, said the full cable does not confirm nor deny the lab theory, and he emphasized that people should not draw too much from its claims.AD\u201cIt was written in January 2018, two years before when this pandemic is judged to have started, and a great deal of change can happen within a lab like this in two years time,\u201d he said.\u201cOverall, my judgment continues to be that [covid-19] is consistent with a naturally occurring source,\u201d he added. \u201cI\u2019m very much hoping that Chinese public health officials will soon share the results of their scientific and epidemiologic investigations into the origin of [covid-19].\u201dThe cable\u2019s contents were first reported by Washington Post columnist Josh Rogin.\n\n", "comment": "1.4k Comments", "topic": "National Security"}, {"cover": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/BLWWTNWNEQI6VGNQQQTOE3JAHM.jpghttps://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/BLWWTNWNEQI6VGNQQQTOE3JAHM.jpg", "title": "U.S. hatches plan to build a quantum Internet that might be unhackable", "date": "Jul 23, 2020", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/07/23/us-plan-quantum-internet/", "keyword": "China and Security", "website": "the Washington Post", "author": "Jeanne Whalen", "content": "U.S. officials and scientists unveiled a plan Thursday to pursue what they called one of the most important technological frontiers of the 21st century: building a quantum Internet.Speaking in Chicago, one of the main hubs of the work, they set goals for forging what they called a second Internet \u2014 one that would function alongside the globe\u2019s existing networks, using the laws of quantum mechanics to share information more securely and to connect a new generation of computers and sensors.Support our journalism. Subscribe today.arrow-rightQuantum technology seeks to harness the distinct properties of atoms, photons and electrons to build more powerful computers and other tools for processing information. A quantum Internet relies on photons exhibiting a quantum state known as entanglement, which allows them to share information over long distances without having a physical connection.ADADDavid Awschalom, a professor at the University of Chicago\u2019s Pritzker School of Molecular Engineering and senior scientist at Argonne National Laboratory, called the Internet project a pillar of the nation\u2019s quantum-research program.\u201cIt\u2019s the birth of a new technology. It\u2019s becoming a global competition. Every major country on earth has launched a quantum program \u2026 because it is becoming clearer and clearer there will be big impacts,\u201d he said in an interview.Seven basic questions about quantum technology, answeredThe United States\u2019 top technology rival, China, is investing heavily in quantum technology, a field that could transform information processing and confer big economic and national security advantages to countries that dominate it. Europe is also hotly pursuing the research.ADThe Energy Department and its 17 national labs will form the backbone of the project.ADHow exactly the work will be funded wasn\u2019t clear. The Energy Department did not announce a funding figure for the project Thursday. Speaking to reporters, Paul Dabbar, the Energy Department\u2019s undersecretary for science, said the federal government invests about $500 to $700 million a year in quantum information technology, suggesting some of that money would fund the new Internet.In an interview, Dabbar said there would probably be further funding announcements for the project in the future.Panagiotis Spentzouris, head of quantum science at the Chicago-area Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, or Fermilab, said in an interview that more resources, and a clearer project structure, will be needed to carry out the blueprint published Thursday.ADThe 38-page document lays out research priorities and milestones to aim for, but it doesn\u2019t assign detailed tasks to particular parties.ADInitial users of a quantum Internet could include national security agencies, financial institutions and health-care companies seeking to send data more securely, researchers said.The networks promise to be more secure \u2014 some even say unhackable \u2014 because of the nature of photons and other quantum bits, known as qubits. Any attempt to observe or disrupt these particles would automatically alter their state and destroy the information being transmitted, scientists say.A quantum Internet could also be used to connect various quantum computers with one another, helping boost their total computing power. Quantum computers are still at an early stage of development and not yet as powerful as classical computers, but connecting them via an Internet could help accelerate their use for solving complex problems like finding new pharmaceuticals or new high-tech materials, Awschalom said.ADADEventually consumers might also tap into the quantum Internet, to buy products with less risk of their credit card details being hacked, or to send and receive sensitive personal information such as health records or social security numbers, Spentzouris said. It is possible consumers will surf seamlessly between the regular and quantum Internets as they make purchases and send information, without necessarily knowing they are switching platforms, he said.In a sign of the potential economic rewards that quantum technology could bring, Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot both spoke at the announcement Thursday, expressing hope that there would be spillover effects for the city\u2019s tech community.Universities and labs in the region have established the Chicago Quantum Exchange to try to accelerate innovation and economic development.ADADPieces of the network are already up and running at various national labs. In the Chicago area, Argonne National Laboratory has built a 52-mile quantum network that soon will connect to nearby Fermilab, to establish an 80-mile test bed.In New York, Stony Brook University and Brookhaven National Lab have built another 80-mile quantum network.The plan is to slowly connect these local networks nationwide, using fiber-optic cable, satellites and drones fitted with quantum-communication hardware, Spentzouris said.A key piece of hardware called a quantum repeater still needs to be developed to amplify a quantum network\u2019s signal over long distances, researcher said.Awschalom stressed that the country needs to do more to educate a new generation of quantum engineers. \u201cWhen you ask tech companies what is their number one concern with quantum information technology, the number one concern by far is the workforce,\u201d he said. Companies will ask him, \u201cWhere are we going to hire a thousand quantum engineers?\u201d ", "comment": "0 Comments", "topic": "Tech Policy"}, {"cover": "", "title": "N Korea\u2019s Kim boasts of his nukes amid stalled talks with US", "date": "Jul 27, 2020", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/n-koreas-kim-boasts-of-his-nukes-amid-stalled-talks-with-us/2020/07/27/0272f7f8-d06f-11ea-826b-cc394d824e35_story.html", "keyword": "China and Security", "website": "the Washington Post", "author": "", "content": "SEOUL, South Korea \u2014 North Korea leader Kim Jong Un said his country\u2019s hard-won nuclear weapons were a solid security guarantee and a \u201creliable, effective\u201d deterrent that could prevent a second Korean War, state media reported Tuesday.Support our journalism.

But some experts say Pyongyang will likely avoid serious talks with Washington before the U.S. presidential elections in November as there is a chance for a U.S. leadership change.ADKim said in his speech Monday his country has tried to become \u201ca nuclear state\u201d with \u201can absolute might\u201d to prevent another war and that it has now built such a deterrent, according to the Korean Central News Agency.AD\u201cNow, we\u2019ve changed to a country which can defend itself reliably and unwaveringly against high-intensity pressures and military threats and blackmailing by imperialistic reactionaries and hostile forces,\u201d Kim said.\u201cThere won\u2019t be any war on this land again and our national security and future will be guaranteed firmly and permanently because of our reliable, effective self-defensive nuclear deterrent,\u201d Kim said.Kim\u2019s speech followed recent remarks by both North Korean and U.S. officials suggesting they were reluctant to engage in a new round of diplomacy on the North\u2019s nuclear program anytime soon.ADU.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had said President Donald Trump would only want to engage with Kim if there were real prospects of progress. Kim\u2019s sister and senior ruling party official, Kim Yo Jong, said a new summit would be \u201cunpractical\u201d for North Korea and that Pyongyang won\u2019t gift Trump a high-level meeting that he can boast as a foreign policy achievement.ADKim Jong Un and Trump met three times since Kim in 2018 abruptly reached out to Washington and Seoul for talks after expressing his intent to deal away his advancing nuclear arsenals. Many experts were skeptical of Kim\u2019s disarmament commitment and said he only aimed to weaken U.S.-led sanctions and perfect his nuclear program.The nuclear diplomacy remains largely stalled since a second Kim-Trump meeting in February 2019 in Vietnam collapsed without reaching any agreement because Trump Kim rejected Kim\u2019s proposal to get extensive sanctions relief in return for a limited denuclearization step.ADKim entered this year with a vow to bolster his nuclear program and threatened to unveil a new \u201cstrategic\u201d weapon. He also said he would no longer be bound by a self-imposed moratorium on nuclear and long-range missile tests. Kim hasn\u2019t performed such high-profile weapons tests, which some analysts say could completely derail diplomacy with the United States.ADNorth Korea\u2019s economic difficulties were believed to have worsened due to the coronavirus pandemic, which led North Korea to seal its border with China, its biggest trading partner and economic pipeline, in January.Kim on Friday ordered the total lockdown of the city of Kaesong near the border with South Korea because a person there had suspected COVID-19 symptoms. North Korea has so far there has been no virus patient on its territory, a claim questioned by outside experts.ADKCNA reported Tuesday authorities were swiftly supplying masks, medicines, test equipment, food and other necessities to Kaesong. It said authorities have boosted their border closures.Experts say a pandemic in North Korea could cause devastating consequences because of its broken health care system and lack of medical supplies.Copyright 2020 The Associated Press.

Republicans proposed $200 a week, saying the generous bump discourages people from returning to work. Democrats call the added benefits a lifeline for those who have lost their jobs.ADTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and White House chief of staff Mark Meadows worked through the weekend on the GOP proposal and have agreed to negotiate with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Democratic Senate leader Chuck Schumer. House Democrats passed a $3 trillion relief package a couple of months ago.ADIn Europe, rising infections in Spain and other countries caused alarm only weeks after nations reopened their borders in hopes of  reviving tourism. Over the weekend, Britain imposed a 14-day quarantine on travelers arriving from Spain, Norway ordered a 10-day quarantine for people returning from the entire Iberian peninsula, and France urged its citizens not to visit Spain\u2019s Catalonia region.Scientists set speed records getting vaccines into massive testing just months after the coronavirus emerged. But they stressed that the public shouldn\u2019t fear that anyone is cutting corners.AD\u201cThis is a significant milestone,\u201d NIH Director Francis Collins said after the first test injection of Moderna\u2019s vaccine was given, at 6:45 a.m. in Savannah, Georgia. \u201cYes, we\u2019re going fast, but no, we are not going to compromise\u201d on proving whether the vaccine is safe and effective.AD\u201cWe are focusing on speed because every day matters,\u201d added Stephane Bancel, CEO of Massachusetts-based Moderna.After volunteers get two doses a month apart, scientists will closely track which group experiences more infections as they go about their daily routines, especially in areas where the virus is spreading unchecked.The answer probably won\u2019t come until November or December, cautioned Dr. Anthony Fauci, NIH\u2019s infectious-diseases chief.Among many questions the study may answer: How much protection does just one dose offer compared with the two scientists think are needed? If it works, will it protect against severe disease or block infection entirely?ADADDon\u2019t expect a vaccine as strong as the measles vaccine, which prevents about 97% of measles infections, Fauci said, adding he would be happy with a COVID-19 vaccine that\u2019s 60% effective.Several other vaccines made by China and by Britain\u2019s Oxford University began smaller final-stage tests in Brazil and other hard-hit countries earlier this month. But the U.S. requires its own tests of any vaccine that might be used in the country.Every month through the fall, the government-funded COVID-19 Prevention Network will roll out a new study of a leading candidate, each with 30,000 volunteers.The final U.S. study of the Oxford shot is set to begin in August, followed by a candidate from Johnson & Johnson in September and one from Novavax in October.ADThat\u2019s a stunning number of people needed to roll up their sleeves for science. In recent weeks, more than 150,000 Americans filled out an online registry signaling interest, Collins said.

Subscribe today.arrow-rightIn a new paper, we show that racist, anti-Chinese taunts boost support for the Chinese regime from an unexpected group: a new generation of Chinese students in the United States, a cohort many would think likely to embrace democratic values.Senior figures in the Trump administration like deputy national security adviser Matt Pottinger have encouraged the Chinese people to bring democracy to China. But anti-Chinese rhetoric spouted by the president and repeated by his supporters makes this goal far less likely.How China\u2019s new national security law will hobble Hong Kong\u2019s pro-democracy movementWe surveyed Chinese students at 62 U.S. universities In the spring , we surveyed over 300 first-year Chinese students studying in the United States. Working with research partners in China, we also conducted the same survey with 500 first-year students in three top Chinese universities. We recruited the students for our study via student networks and a social media platform (see here for information on data and methodology).ADADWe asked a dozen survey questions to measure students\u2019 preferences for nationalism and political liberalism, and their support for the Chinese regime. For example, we asked them to what extent they agree that \u201cnational unity and territorial integrity should be defended at all costs\u201d (to determine their thoughts on nationalism). Another statement explored their views on government transparency, one hallmark of liberal democracy: \u201cthe government should freely disseminate information even if information disclosure may increase of the risks of widespread panic.\u201d Here\u2019s what we found.Chinese students in the United States are less nationalistic than their peers in China Compared to students at top universities in China, Chinese students studying at U.S. colleges are less likely to support nationalistic policies. Those studying in the United States are also more likely to subscribe to liberal political values. And this group of students in our survey was less supportive of the Chinese regime than their peers in China.How coronavirus changes the political outlook in China and the U.S.While we think the differences between the two groups reflect differences in opinion, one caveat is that Chinese students in the United States may be less likely to self-censor when responding to questions about politics. Students in China may feel pressure to give a politically safe response.And we looked at the impact of anti-Chinese rhetoricWe put an experiment in our survey of U.S.-based students to measure whether exposure to racially derogatory comments changes students\u2019 views toward China\u2019s authoritarian political system. We randomly divided students into three groups, all of which viewed criticism of the Chinese government. Here\u2019s what we varied: whether respondents saw criticism from U.S. media and social media sources, and whether they also saw racially derogatory comments.ADADIn our control group, students read a Chinese news article about the death of  Li Wenliang, a Wuhan doctor who was silenced for speaking out about covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, and who subsequently died of it . Students then read 10 comments we collected from Chinese social media criticizing the Chinese government for its covid-19 response.Students in the other two groups read a similar article about Li\u2019s death, but this came from a mainstream U.S. media outlet article \u2014 one group then read 10 comments we collected from U.S. social media criticizing the Chinese government\u2019s handling of covid-19. Students in the other group also read actual comments from U.S. social media: Five of these comments were critical of the Chinese government, and five contained racially derogatory comments blaming Chinese people for the spread of covid-19.We then asked students in all three groups the same questions to measure their support for China\u2019s political system. We discovered that students exposed to racist comments on U.S. social media were more likely to say that China\u2019s political system is suitable for China than the control group \u2014 and that nothing about China\u2019s political system needs to change.ADADHowever, for all these questions, students in the United States who read highly critical comments of the Chinese government written by Westerners don\u2019t show more support for China\u2019s current political system. This suggests that the monolithic view that Chinese overseas students are fierce defenders of the Chinese regime may be off the mark.The U.S. has an ugly history of blaming \u2018foreigners\u2019 for diseaseSurprisingly, when we look at who is most affected by the xenophobic attacks, we found that students who are least supportive of nationalistic policies exhibit the biggest increases in support for Chinese authoritarianism. This may be because racist comments provide new information to less nationalistic students or because those who hold strongly nationalistic views are already highly supportive of Beijing.Does the U.S. covid-19 response affect our results? Some scholars argue that the U.S. failure to control the covid-19 outbreak is a major setback for the appeal of democracy. In China, for instance, recent surveys show that support for the Chinese government and authoritarianism have increased significantly since the beginning of the outbreak.ADADWe asked students to evaluate how different governments around the world have handled covid-19. Nearly 90 percent of our respondents say the U.S. government has handled covid-19 badly or very badly, while only 10 percent say the same of the Chinese government. But the relative performance of the United States and China on covid-19 does not account for the effect of racism on boosting support for the Chinese regime. In particular, survey respondents exposed to xenophobic comments did not have a worse view of the U.S. political system \u2014 but they did show greater support for China\u2019s authoritarian regime. Anger toward the anti-Chinese rhetoric seems to be the main driver of this response.It has become a joke in China to call Trump Chuan Jianguo, or \u201cBuild-the-Country Trump\u201d \u2014 a riff on a term that refers to strengthening China\u2019s power. Our survey experiment suggests that racist rhetoric pushes Chinese students who would otherwise be likely to subscribe to democratic values into the pro-China camp, and away from wanting to see political change in China.By repeatedly using racist, xenophobic rhetoric and inciting discrimination against Chinese and Asians in America, Trump may be handing an invaluable gift to President Xi.ADADThe TMC newsletter has moved!

Subscribe today.arrow-rightThe rare metal has been used as an alloy to strengthen steel, aluminum and titanium in the construction, auto, aerospace and computer industries but must currently be imported \u2014 primarily from Austria, Canada and Russia.The Bureau of Land Management said in announcing plans earlier this month for the mine\u2019s expedited review that U.S. dependence on foreign vanadium \u201ccreates a strategic vulnerability for both the economy and military to adverse government action or other events that can disrupt the supply of this key mineral.\u201dADHenry Ford is credited with the first commercial application of vanadium when he used it to toughen the steel in the frame of the Model T in the early 1900s.ADVanadium has been extracted in small amounts in the U.S. but only as a minor byproduct of other mining operations, mostly uranium mines in Utah.China produces more than half the world\u2019s vanadium but consumes most of it domestically. China\u2019s recent move toward adopting standards for construction rebar metal rod standards as tough as those in the U.S. is a driving force in increased demand for the material valued for its high strength-to-weight ratio.The Nevada Vanadium Co. plans to mine about 10 million pounds (4.5 million kilograms) a year, or about half of the overall U.S. demand, on 10 square miles (2,589 hectares) land owned by the Bureau of Land Management about 200 miles (321 kilometers) east of Reno.ADThe Canadian-based company with an office in the tiny community of Eureka near the mine site plans also plans to extract about 50,000 pounds (22,679 kilograms) of yellow cake uranium annually, a concern to environmentalists who aren\u2019t worried about vanadium.ADEnriched yellow cake uranium can be used to make nuclear weapons or produce fuel for nuclear power plants.Environmental reviews for large mines can take years under normal regulatory schemes. But Bureau District Manager Doug Furtado is expecting a decision in about 12 months.\u201cIf approved, this project would provide hundreds of jobs and will contribute to the nation\u2019s domestic source of critical minerals,\u201d Furtado said.ADExpedited review is allowed under Trump\u2019s 2017 order directing the interior and commerce secretaries to develop a to protect and expand commercial access to critical minerals.The final list of the 35 designated minerals issued in May 2018 included vanadium, aluminum, lithium, magnesium, platinum, tungsten and uranium.In addition to airplanes and rockets, critical minerals are used to manufacture batteries, computer LCD screens, integrated circuits, optical devices and medical imaging.AD\u201cWithout them, the nation\u2019s economy would grind to a halt, and the technological edge maintained by the Armed Forces and intelligence community would erode,\u201d the agency said.ADNevada Vanadium Co. began developing plans for the mine five years ago. It submitted a management plan to the bureau in 2018.In addition to Chinese construction standards, demand is being driven by development of a unique vanadium flow battery showing promise for meeting future energy storage needs.Ron Espell, Nevada Vanadium\u2019s vice president for environment and sustainability, said vanadium mines historically have been cost-prohibitive in the U.S. because of the poor quality of deposits.Vanadium produced as a byproduct at uranium mines is especially impure, as is vanadium produced during the oil refining process. China extracts vanadium during steel slag production, but the resulting emissions are extremely high and far above what\u2019s legal under the U.S. Clean Air Act, Espell said.ADAD\u201cIt\u2019s all about the purity and it never pencils out economically,\u201d he said. \u201cThis one is unique. It\u2019s in the 98 to 99% percent pure range. It makes our project very attractive.\u201dThe mine would employ up to 120 construction workers starting as early as next year, followed by up to 120 mine employees.Environmentalists are concerned that the mine could hurt wildlife, including the imperiled greater sage grouse.\u201cGroundwater contamination in this area from uranium mining could spell catastrophe for the biodiversity there,\u201d said Patrick Donnelly, Nevada director of the Center for Biological Diversity.Uranium mining hasn\u2019t occurred in Nevada for years, Donnelly said. He said Nevada has a \u201ctroubled history with the nuclear industry,\u201d from atomic weapons detonations at the Nevada Test site to proposals to dump nuclear waste at Yucca Mountain.\u201cNevadans are going to be very wary of foreign mining companies inserting our public lands into the nuclear supply chain,\u201d he said.Copyright 2020 The Associated Press.

They\u2019re calling for a five-year transition to limit the disruption for customers.\u00a0Huawei officials, meanwhile, are warning that the U.K. might be abandoning its chance to be a leader in 5G, which is expected to be much faster and more efficient than current telecom networks and capable of carrying exponentially more data.\u00a0\u201cThis is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for the U.K.,\u201d Huawei Global Vice President Victor Zhang warned.\u00a0Some U.S. companies are also sounding alarms about the difficulty of transitioning away from Huawei.\u00a0A slew of industry groups, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the Aerospace Industries Association and the Computing Technology Industry Association, are pushing for a one-year delay on a Trump administration ban on government contractors using Huawei, as Inside Cybersecurity reports. The ban is expected to be finalized shortly.ADADThey say there\u2019s not enough time to implement the ban and contractors need to focus on weathering the coronavirus pandemic.\u00a0\u201cAn extension of the deadline would actually strengthen U.S. security by ensuring better planning and execution of the statutory prohibitions,\u201d David Berteau, chief executive of the Professional Services Council, a coalition of government contractors, told Defense News.\u00a0Those calls are unlikely to gain much traction from the White House or in Congress, where Republicans and Democrats are largely united in getting tough on China \u2014 and on Huawei, in particular.The fact that allies are turning against Huawei despite those costs is a feather in the cap for the Trump administration\u2019s foreign policy.\u00a0It comes after months during which allies questioned why the administration couldn't produce a \u201csmoking gun\u201d showing that Huawei posed a spying danger. They were also highly skeptical of President Trump for seeming to use U.S. efforts against Huawei as a bargaining chip in U.S.-China trade negotiations.\u00a0ADADThe turn is partly due to increasingly stringent U.S. restrictions.\u00a0The harshest move came in May, when the Commerce Department effectively hobbled Huawei\u2019s supply chain by banning foreign firms selling computer chips within the United States from also working with the Chinese firm.\u00a0The shift was helped along by global anger over China\u2019s lack of transparency during the early days of the coronavirus pandemic and its crackdown in Hong Kong.\u00a0Finally, U.S. officials changed their strategy from arguing Huawei itself was guilty of spying to arguing that the company simply couldn\u2019t refuse to aid spying by Beijing under China\u2019s communist system.\u00a0\u201cWe really pivoted that discussion over time,\u201d said Robert Strayer, deputy assistant secretary for cyber and international communications and information policy in the State Department. \u201cIf you fully understand the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s intent in the way the system works in China, there\u2019s not autonomy for those companies.\u201d\u00a0The U.S. argument has worked with many allies, but it won\u2019t put Huawei out of business.\u00a0The U.K.\u2019s decision effectively means Huawei will be cut off from 5G networks across the United States and all four of its closest intelligence-sharing partners \u2014 the U.K., Canada, Australia and New Zealand.ADADNumerous other nations have also banned Huawei from their networks, including\u00a0Poland, Estonia, the Czech Republic and Japan. India, which has not yet built any 5G system, nevertheless barred two state-run firms from using Chinese gear after security clashes along its border with China.But Huawei and another Chinese telecom, ZTE, control about 90 percent of the 5G market in China, which accounts for about half the global market. And they\u2019re pushing to control the 5G markets in Latin America and Africa when they develop.That has many analysts fearing a future in which the world is effectively bisected between regions that rely on Western technology and those in which Chinese technology is ascendant.The keysThe spyware firm NSO Group can continue to sell its tools internationally, an Israeli court ruled.The judge rejected a request by Amnesty International and other groups to revoke NSO's export license on the basis that it had facilitated human rights violations. The groups failed to provide adequate evidence for their claim that the company attempted to hack the phone of an Amnesty International activist, the judge said.ADADThe ruling was a blow to cybersecurity and privacy groups that accuse NSO of helping authoritarian governments spy on activists, journalists and political dissidents.\u00a0\u201cThe ruling of the court flies in the face of the mountains of evidence of NSO Group\u2019s spyware being used to target human rights defenders from Saudi Arabia to Mexico,\u201d Danna Ingleton, acting co-director of Amnesty Tech, said in a statement.NSO, meanwhile, applauded the decision. \u201cThe judgment is irrefutable evidence that the regulatory framework in which we operate in is of the highest international standard,\u201d it said in a statement.WhatsApp is also suing NSO for allegedly helping to hack at least 100 of its users across 20 countries.At least 65,000 mail-in ballots have been rejected in primaries held during the pandemic so far.The ballots arrived after election deadlines but often through no fault of the voter, according to an NPR analysis reported by Pam Fessler and Elena Moore. The rejected ballots make up a small percentage of total ballots in most states but they're enough to make a difference in a close election.\u00a0ADADIn some states the figure is higher. Virginia, for example, rejected nearly 6 percent of mail-in ballots. And even a small percentage of rejected ballots is likely to undermine people's faith that their vote will be counted.\u00a0Even more concerning, people voting by mail for the first time are more likely to have their ballots rejected, Charles Stewart, a political scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, told NPR. That could cause chaos, with an influx of voters switching to mail voting because of the coronavirus pandemic.\u00a0Democrats and advocacy groups have filed lawsuits trying to force several states to count all mail votes as long as they\u2019re postmarked before Election Day. Republicans argue that it would create too much confusion to continue to count votes after Election Day.Trump confirmed a U.S. cyberattack against a Russian troll farm ahead of the 2018 midterms.\u00a0The president made the confirmation during an\u00a0interview with Washington Post columnist\u00a0Marc Thiessen.\u00a0ADADThe Post first reported on the U.S. Cyber Command operation last year, but White House and military officials had not previously acknowledged it,\u00a0Ellen reports. The operation was a prime example of Trump administration efforts to\u00a0aggressively punch back against adversaries in cyberspace. The White House expanded Cybercom\u2019s authority to launch offensive attacks in 2018.The confirmation marked a rare acknowledgment by the president of Russian efforts to sow discord in U.S. elections. The intelligence community warns that Russia is likely to interfere again in the 2020 election.Cybercom also\u00a0carried out an attack against computer systems used by Iran\u2019s\u00a0Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps to target oil tankers in the Persian Gulf\u00a0last August.

The White House said he has mild symptoms and \u201chas been self-isolating and working from a secure location off site.\u201dADThe move to restart the national pastime ran into trouble just five days into the long-delayed season: Two major league baseball games scheduled for Monday night were called off as the Miami Marlins coped with an outbreak \u2014 the Marlins\u2019 home opener against the Baltimore Orioles, and the New York Yankees\u2019 game in Philadelphia, where the Marlins used the clubhouse over the weekend.ADAs for relief from the economic damage done by the virus, Republicans on Capitol Hill rolled out a $1 trillion package that includes another round of $1,200 direct payments but reduces the extra $600 a week in federal unemployment benefits that expire for millions of Americans on Friday. Republicans proposed $200 a week, saying the generous bump discourages people from returning to work. Democrats call the added benefits a lifeline for those who have lost their jobs.Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and White House chief of staff Mark Meadows worked through the weekend on the GOP proposal and have agreed to negotiate with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Democratic Senate leader Chuck Schumer. House Democrats passed a $3 trillion relief package a couple of months ago.ADIn Europe, rising infections in Spain and other countries caused alarm only weeks after nations reopened their borders in hopes of  reviving tourism. Over the weekend, Britain imposed a 14-day quarantine on travelers arriving from Spain, Norway ordered a 10-day quarantine for people returning from the entire Iberian peninsula, and France urged its citizens not to visit Spain\u2019s Catalonia region.ADScientists set speed records getting a made-from-scratch vaccine into massive testing just months after the coronavirus emerged. But they stressed that the public shouldn\u2019t fear that anyone is cutting corners.\u201cThis is a significant milestone,\u201d NIH Director Francis Collins said after the very first test injection was given, at 6:45 a.m. in Savannah, Georgia. \u201cYes, we\u2019re going fast, but no, we are not going to compromise\u201d on proving whether the vaccine is safe and effective.AD\u201cWe are focusing on speed because every day matters,\u201d added Stephane Bancel, CEO of Massachusetts-based Moderna.After volunteers get two doses a month apart, scientists will closely track which group experiences more infections as they go about their daily routines, especially in areas where the virus is spreading unchecked.ADThe answer probably won\u2019t come until November or December, cautioned Dr. Anthony Fauci, NIH\u2019s infectious-diseases chief.Among many questions the study may answer: How much protection does just one dose offer compared with the two scientists think are needed? If it works, will it protect against severe disease or block infection entirely?Don\u2019t expect a vaccine as strong as the measles vaccine, which prevents about 97% of measles infections, Fauci said, adding he would be happy with a COVID-19 vaccine that\u2019s 60% effective.ADSeveral other vaccines made by China and by Britain\u2019s Oxford University began smaller final-stage tests in Brazil and other hard-hit countries earlier this month. But the U.S. requires its own tests of any vaccine that might be used in the country.ADEvery month through the fall, the government-funded COVID-19 Prevention Network will roll out a new study of a leading candidate, each with 30,000 volunteers.The final U.S. study of the Oxford shot is set to begin in August, followed by a candidate from Johnson & Johnson in September and one from Novavax in October. Pfizer Inc. plans its own 30,000-person study this summer.That\u2019s a stunning number of people needed to roll up their sleeves for science. In recent weeks, more than 150,000 Americans filled out an online registry signaling interest, Collins said. But many more are needed.ADNIH is working to make sure that the study isn\u2019t just filled with healthy, younger volunteers but includes populations hit hardest by COVID-19, including older adults, those in poor health and African-Americans and Latinos.AD\u201cWe really are going to depend upon that sense of volunteerism for individuals from every different corner of society if we\u2019re going to really find out how this vaccine, and its potential to end this terrible pandemic, is go to work in each of those groups,\u201d Collins said.___The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Department of Science Education.

Subscribe today.arrow-rightThe settlement with wholly-owned Essentra FZE Co. Ltd is the U.S. Justice Department\u2019s first corporate enforcement action for sanctions violations involving the Pyongyang regime, the department said.In entering a deferred prosecution agreement, the company will pay a fine and incur a reputational hit but will not face criminal charges. However, former employees and an India-based tobacco company with which Essentra partnered, BBM Bommidala Group, face further scrutiny, authorities indicated in court filings and news releases.ADADIn court filings, Essentra FZE admitted responsibility and agreed to what is effectively corporate probation, pledging to report any criminal employee misconduct, cooperate fully with investigators and toughen internal controls over a three-year period. After the probation, one count of conspiring to violate U.S. sanctions law will be dismissed.Court filings described what U.S. officials in Washington called \u201cegregious\u201d wrongdoing by the firm in exporting cigarette filters to North Korea through a network of front companies in China and other countries, using deceptive practices to move money through U.S. banks.The scheme, which lasted about a year, began in October 2017 when two employees of the Dubai subsidiary were warned that because of sanctions, a front company would be used to receive payments for a customer in North Korea, court documents said. They were instructed not to mention the country in contract documents, and instead falsely declared China as the destination of products, according to charging documents.ADAD\u201c[D]on\u2019t mention that customer is in my country \u2026 You just mention China or where else. Contract will be signed by other foreign company,\u201d a North Korean buyer allegedly told an Essentra FZE manager and customer agent, according to a summary of facts filed with the court.\u201cUnderstood,\u201d one employee replied, according to the filing. Both employees have since left the firm, and court filings state they were in contact with the India-based firm\u2019s employees regarding the terms and status of the contract.U.S. prosecutors in Washington filed a 25-page agreement and charging documents in federal court on Thursday, and the Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control announced a civil fine. Both moves enforce sanctions imposed in March 2016 after North Korea tested what it claimed was a hydrogen bomb and conducted a launch using ballistic-missile technology.ADADThe sanctions bar international shipments that further the country\u2019s nuclear or missile programs, cut Pyongyang off from the U.S. banking system and expand the list of luxury items its elite cannot receive.\u201cThe sanctions the United States has imposed on the North Korean regime are of the utmost importance to the national security of our nation,\u201d said Assistant Attorney General for National Security John C. Demers, whose division announced the action with the FBI and the U.S. attorney\u2019s office for the District of Columbia. \u201cThe company has now committed to working with our prosecutors to bring those individuals responsible for these acts to justice.\u201dThe filings cite three payments worth $333,000, for which U.S. officials sought double penalties. Of note, two of the payments were not completed in U.S. dollars and never transited the U.S. banking system \u2014 a typical tripwire for American criminal enforcement. Though the transactions were conducted in local currency, the UAE company used a foreign branch of a U.S. bank, triggering U.S. jurisdiction, according to the filings.ADADThe Office of Foreign Assets Control said in a statement that it could have sought triple penalties, but Essentra FZE has provided and agreed to continue providing substantial cooperation.Still, the agency listed several \u201caggravating\u201d factors, including the willful evasion of U.S. law and policy, and Essentra\u2019s status as a \u201csophisticated commercial group\u201d operating in international markets and with gross sales of about $1\u00a0billion a year.Essentra FZE from about 2013 to 2019 was a subsidiary of a partnership begun in 2013 in Dubai with an Indian tobacco company identified only as \u201cCompany 1\u201d in court filings. That partnership was made with BBM Bommidala Group, public filings and announcements show, and Essentra\u2019s parent bought out BBM\u2019s 49\u00a0percent partnership last year. The Indian company could not immediately be reached for comment.ADADIn a statement, Essentra said none of the transactions were approved or known of by senior management outside the UAE. The company also blamed \u201cisolated failures\u201d of its compliance policies and declared a commitment \u201cto doing business the right way.\u201d\u201cA very thorough and in depth investigation has been carried out to fully understand the root cause of the issues we have seen,\u201d chief executive Paul Forman said in a statement, \u201cWe have made a very significant investment of both time and money, which has now equipped us with enhanced protection against any potential future issues of this nature.\u201dThe agreement must go before a federal judge, but appeals courts have given judges little leeway to review or alter such deals. Deferred prosecution agreements are used dozens of times a year by the Justice Department to obtain payments totaling billions of dollars to resolve investigations into bribery, fraud, safety and sanctions violations, and other alleged crimes.Read the Essentra deferred prosecution agreement and statement of offenseThursday\u2019s action was the latest U.S. enforcement efforts targeting the North Korean government amid Washington\u2019s stalled diplomatic effort to eliminate Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear missile and weapons capabilities.ADADUnited Nations experts have detailed that North Korea evades sanctions by using agents of state-owned and other banks overseas to facilitate a global web of illicit oil, arms and coal deals to bring in foreign currency. The efforts also include ship-to-ship cargo transfers at sea, large-scale cryptocurrency hacks and ransomware attacks.In 2018, for example, the Treasury Department sanctioned a Chinese company for allegedly falsifying shipping documents to smuggle tobacco, cigarettes and alcohol into North Korea. Treasury officials said Pyongyang reportedly netted over $1\u00a0billion from the illicit trade.U.S. brings massive N. Korean sanctions case, targeting state-owned bank and former government officialsLast month, prosecutors in the same U.S. attorney\u2019s office in the District of Columbia charged 28 North Korean and five Chinese individuals with facilitating more than $2.5\u00a0billion of illegal payments for Pyongyang through a network based in its state-owned Foreign Trade Bank.ADADA 50-page federal indictment accused the individuals of operating a clandestine global network from countries including China, Russia, Libya and Thailand in the largest North Korean sanctions violations case charged by U.S. prosecutors. The U.S. government also filed asset forfeiture charges and seized more than $63\u00a0million, the indictment said.U.S. authorities and prosecutors in New York City and Washington have penalized numerous banks for sanctions-related violations using deferred prosecution agreements since 2010.Skeptics such as Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.)  have criticized such deals, saying they are not transparent to courts or the public. Warren has also said the deals protect companies and executives who violate the law from indictment and jail and may not even require admission of wrongdoing.ADADThe Justice Department has turned to such agreements to resolve complex corporate enforcement actions, saying they allow for ongoing oversight, regulation and strengthened compliance with money-laundering and other controls.In 2019, London-based bank Standard Chartered agreed to pay $1.1\u00a0billion to U.S. and British authorities, and Italy\u2019s UniCredit and two subsidiaries agreed to pay $1.3\u00a0billion to settle probes of violations of U.S. sanctions on Iran and other countries.France\u2019s BNP Paribas pleaded guilty in 2014 and paid a penalty of $8.9\u00a0billion.\n\nU.S. brings massive N.

This is an existential threat to almost every government on Earth and we can expect that tremendous resources have been diverted from other tasks to focus on this virus.\u201d\nU.S. officials say Russian government hackers have penetrated energy and nuclear company business networks\nADThe Russian hacker group scanned computer IP addresses owned by the organizations and then deployed malware to try to gain access, officials with Britain\u2019s National Cyber Security Centre said. In some cases, the hackers used custom malware known as \u201cWellMess\u201d and \u00ad\u201cWellMail\u201d to conduct further operations on a victim\u2019s system, British officials said.ADPaul Chichester, director of operations at the NCSC, said in a statement that APT29 launched \u201cdespicable attacks against those doing vital work to combat the coronavirus pandemic.\u201dThe World Health Organization reports that of the more than 160 vaccines being developed, 23 have begun clinical trials in humans \u2014 including top candidates being developed by academics, national laboratories and pharmaceutical companies in Britain, Canada and the United States.ADRussia is developing 26 vaccines, Russian Deputy Prime Minister Tatyana Golikova said Wednesday, but only two are undergoing clinical trials. A month-long trial on 38 people for one of the vaccines concluded this week. Kirill Dmitriev, head of the Russian Direct Investment Fund, the country\u2019s sovereign wealth fund, told reporters that a larger trial with several thousand people is expected to begin in August.AD\u201cWe will produce 30\u00a0million doses of the vaccine in Russia, or 50\u00a0million if necessary, which means that Russia may complete vaccinations early next year,\u201d Dmitriev said.Alongside their legitimate efforts, the Russians are probably cheating, Western analysts say.AD\u201cI have absolutely no doubt that if there was the slightest probability of stealing it, the Russians would do it,\u201d said Jonathan Eyal, international director at the Royal United Services Institute, a London-based think tank.\u201cMr. Putin has not had a good pandemic,\u201d Eyal said. \u201cHe has devolved the handling of it to regional governments to try and escape responsibility. He\u2019s nowhere to be seen. The figures about the numbers who have died are clearly manipulated.\u201dThe Russian hacking group APT29 is well known to cyber experts. U.S. intelligence officials say it is part of the SVR, Russia\u2019s foreign intelligence service. That outfit hacked the White House and State Department email systems in 2014. It also infiltrated the Democratic National Committee servers in summer 2015, many months before the Russian military spy agency GRU did, investigators said.ADADThe GRU funneled hacked emails to the anti-secrecy group WikiLeaks, which released them online, in an attempt to sow discord in the party. The SVR, by contrast, hacked the party\u2019s servers apparently for classic espionage purposes \u2014 to glean insights into the plans and policies of the potential next U.S. president.\u201cThey quietly steal information from their targets, and if you are hit by this actor, you may never know it,\u201d Hultquist said. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about an intelligence collection operation where Russia quietly leverages the research of others to advance their own.\u201d\nHow the Russians hacked the DNC and passed its emails to WikiLeaks\nBritain\u2019s Raab also told a parliamentary intelligence committee Thursday that \u201cRussian actors\u201d sought to interfere in the United Kingdom\u2019s 2019 general election by acquiring unpublished documents used in trade talks between the U.S. and Britain, and then leaking the material via social media.AD\u201cSensitive government documents relating to the U.K.-U.S. Free Trade Agreement were illicitly acquired before the 2019 General Election and disseminated online via the social media platform Reddit,\u201d Raab said in a written statement to Parliament.The foreign secretary added, \u201cIt is almost certain that Russian actors sought to interfere in the 2019 General Election through the online amplification of illicitly acquired and leaked Government documents.\u201d Moscow called the charges of election interference \u201cunfounded.\u201d  \u201cThe British administration is making the same anti-Russian mistake again and thus not only further undermining bilateral relations with Moscow, but also its own authority,\u201d Leonid Slutsky, head of the Russian State Duma\u2019s foreign affairs committee, told reporters Thursday, according to the Interfax news agency.\u201cRaab is using the phrase \u2018highly likely\u2019 again,\u201d Slutsky said. \u201cThat is, a criminal case is again being initiated on the basis of \u2018highly likely,\u2019 in the absence of specific evidence, which the head of the Foreign Office admits. What happened to the presumption of innocence? Where is the evidence?\u201d\u00a0After the trade documents emerged online, they were used during the December 2019 election by the opposition Labour Party and its leader, Jeremy Corbyn, who accused Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his Conservative Party of preparing to \u201csell off\u201d precious access to the National Health Service to U.S. companies.The charges were a hot-button issue at the time but did not change the outcome: Johnson won the election in a landslide.A much-delayed report into allegations of wider Russian interference in Britain\u2019s democracy is due next week.\n\n\n\n\n\nBooth reported from London and Coletta from Toronto.

Subscribe today.arrow-rightBoth the politician, current Ohio House Speaker Larry Householder, and FirstEnergy Corp., identified in an FBI complaint as \u201cCompany A,\u201d got what they wanted last year from what federal officials say was a $60 million bribery scheme funded by an unidentified company the complaint makes clear is FirstEnergy and its affiliates.What Householder and his alleged co-conspirators might not have realized until their arrests on Tuesday and the affidavit was made public was that the FBI had insider help from people who cooperated with agents, recorded phone calls and dinner conversations, and shared text messages from members of the alleged conspiracy.ADADHouseholder, one of the state\u2019s most powerful politicians, and FirstEnergy, which through its affiliates provided nearly all of the cash used to fund the alleged scheme, now face a reckoning that could upend Ohio\u2019s political landscape.Both FirstEnergy and Householder were successful. Householder surged to power with his election as House speaker in January 2019, and FirstEnergy got its bailout. Tens of millions of dollars were then spent to fund a campaign that prevented Ohio voters from deciding in a ballot issue whether they were in favor of paying more on their electric bills to help keep the struggling plants afloat.Householder\u2019s attorney declined to comment on Friday.ADFBI Agent Blane Wetzel\u2019s detailed 81-page affidavit in support of the criminal complaint against Householder and four others showed how the Perry County politician was connected to FirstEnergy. It painstakingly details how the alleged conspiracy to spend $60 million of the corporation\u2019s money unfolded.ADThe affidavit lays out the speaker\u2019s ties to the corporation, starting with Householder and his son flying to President Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration in January 2017 on a FirstEnergy plane.According to the affidavit, there were 84 telephone contacts between Householder and FirstEnergy President and CEO Chuck Jones between February 2017 and July 2019; 14 contacts with the corporation\u2019s vice president for external affairs; and 188 contacts with its Ohio director of state affairs.AD\u201cLet me be clear, at no time did our support for Ohio\u2019s nuclear plants interfere with or supersede our ethical obligations to conduct our business properly,\u201d Jones told investors Friday during a quarterly earnings call. \u201cThe facts will become clear as the investigation progresses.\u201dJones called it a \u201cgrave and disturbing situation,\u201d but said he had \u201cno worries\u201d that he or the company did anything wrong.ADThe affidavit supporting the criminal complaint names Householder\u2019s longtime political adviser, Jeffrey Longstreth, and two lobbyists for a FirstEnergy subsidiary, including former state Republican chair Matt Borges.All the alleged members of the conspiracy benefited personally from the scheme, using sums Wetzel described colloquially as \u201cbags of cash\u201d from FirstEnergy. Householder spent around $500,000 of FirstEnergy money to settle a business lawsuit, pay attorneys, deal with expenses at his Florida home and pay off credit card debt. Another $97,000 was used to pay staff and expenses for his 2018 reelection campaign, Wetzel wrote.ADLongstreth, as the affidavit details, wrote the checks from an account for Generation Now, a nonprofit through which most of the FirstEnergy-related money flowed. Longstreth also essentially ran the campaigns of Republican House candidates whom Householder needed to win so he could assume the speakership and push the divisive bailout bill through the Legislature.ADAccording to the affidavit, Longstreth wired $1 million to his personal brokerage account as the scheme wound down.A message seeking comment was left Friday with Longstreth.Roughly $3 million of FirstEnergy-affiliated money was spent to help 15 Householder-backed House candidates in the May 2018 primaries and six more in the November general election.AD\u201cHaving secured Householder\u2019s power as Speaker, the Enterprise transitioned quickly to fulfilling its end of the corrupt bargain with Company A \u2014 passing nuclear bailout legislation,\u201d Wetzel wrote.It initially appeared that Householder lacked the votes to get bailout bill approved in the spring of 2019. A $9.5 million FirstEnergy-funded media campaign targeted House members\u2019 districts and tipped the scale in Householder and FirstEnergy\u2019s favor, according to the affidavit.ADA House member described as Representative 7 reached out to FBI agents after he grew concerned about pressure from Householder to back the bailout. The lawmaker later was asked to delete text messages from Householder by someone connected to the speaker, according to the affidavit.ADOnce the House approved the bill, $7.4 million was spent on a pressure campaign to convince the Senate to follow suit. That worked, too, and Republican Gov. Mike DeWine signed the bill on July 29, the day the final version was approved by both chambers.The final stage of the alleged conspiracy proved the most expensive: FirstEnergy affiliates through Generation Now spent $38 million to keep a referendum on the bailout off the ballot, according to the affidavit.The dirty tricks campaign included hiring some of the largest signature-gathering firms in the country so that they couldn\u2019t work for Ohioans Against Corporate Bailouts, hiring people to gather signatures for fake petitions to sow confusion and intimidating legitimate signature collectors, according to the affidavit.ADADMost of the $38 million was spent on xenophobic commercials and mailings that rocked the state by warning that China would take over Ohio if the bailout was killed.The citizen group failed to meet its Oct. 21 deadline to gather enough signatures and the measure remains law.Wetzel, in the affidavit, hinted there is more to come in the probe.\u201cI have not included every fact known to me concerning this investigation,\u201d Wetzel wrote. \u201cI have set forth only the facts necessary to establish probable cause that federal crimes have been committed.\u201d___Gillispie reported from Cleveland.

He has equivocated about whether he accepts the U.S. intelligence community\u2019s consensus that Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election. He said during his Helsinki summit with Putin in 2018 that he believes the Russian president's denials.\u00a0ADADTrump has even expressed a willingness to benefit from foreign intervention. He told ABC News last year that he would not necessarily notify the FBI if a foreign country offered him dirt on an opponent. \u201cI think I\u2019d want to hear it,\u201d Trump said.\u00a0Also on Monday afternoon, the Democratic leaders in the House and Senate, plus the party\u2019s top members on the intelligence committees in each chamber, released a somewhat cryptic letter that they sent last week to FBI Director Chris Wray, with a classified appendix, asking for a full congressional briefing before the August recess. \u201cWe are gravely concerned, in particular, that Congress appears to be the target of a concerted foreign interference campaign, which seeks to launder and amplify disinformation in order to influence congressional activity, public debate, and the presidential election in November,\u201d wrote Speaker Nancy Pelosi, House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and Senate Intelligence Vice Chairman Mark Warner.Biden seems determined not to repeat the mistakes that he and many of his advisers apparently believe President Barack Obama made in 2016. Obama warned Putin privately to cut out what he was up to, and intelligence agencies released a statement calling out Russia that October, but the administration waited to impose penalties until after the election.ADADIn an excellent new book, \u201cRigged: America, Russia, and One Hundred Years of Covert Electoral Interference,\u201d David Shimer explores Putin\u2019s effort to undermine former secretary of state Hillary Clinton and boost Trump in 2016. \u201cPutin\u2019s perception of Obama is critical,\u201d Shimer argues. \u201cVladimir Lenin had a favorite saying: \u2018Probe with a bayonet; if you meet steel, stop! If you meet mush, then push!\u2019 Putin aimed to push as far as he could without provoking much pushback. And in Obama, he saw a leader elected to wind down wars, not start them, wary of stumbling into great-power conflict, and largely dismissive of Russia.\u201dShimer quotes alumni of the Obama administration lamenting their former boss\u2019s relative cautiousness, particularly the consequences of his failure to strike Syria after the regime used chemical weapons against civilians. He argues that this prompted Putin to charge forward \u201cwith his digital bayonet.\u201d\u201cThis was a cautious administration in general,\u201d retired Army Gen. David Petraeus, who led the CIA in 2011 and 2012, told the author. \u201cIt was an administration that had a redline that was crossed, and they didn\u2019t act, that said Bashar al-Assad must go, but then did nothing really to make him go, that repeatedly issued ringing rhetorical statements and policies and did not always back them up.\u201dADADLeon Panetta, who served as Obama\u2019s first CIA director and then secretary of defense, added: \u201cI think Putin read it as weakness, and read it as an opportunity to be able to not only do Crimea, but to go into Syria without having anyone stop him from doing that, and thirdly then going after our election institutions as well. I think he felt that he would be able to do it and get away with it.\u201dMichael Morell, who twice served as acting CIA director under Obama, told the author that the then-president\u2019s relative restraint when Putin annexed Crimea \u2013 he declined requests to send lethal arms to the Ukrainians to avoid escalation \u2013 emboldened the Russians to play in the 2016 U.S. election. \u201cI bet you any amount of money that was part of his calculation, whereas if the United States had pushed back harder on Crimea and on eastern Ukraine, then this might never have happened,\u201d Morell told Shimer. (Obama declined to be interviewed for the book.)In his Monday statement, Biden said he would \u201cprefer to focus\u201d his energies on \u201cbringing the international community together\u201d to combat the novel coronavirus pandemic and the economic pain it has caused, but he promised to use the full force of the federal government if he wins to make foreign aggressors pay. He said he would enlist the Department of Defense, the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, the Department of State and the FBI\u2019s Foreign Influence Task Force. \u201cThere's not much I can do about it now except talk about it, and expose it, but it is a serious concern,\u201d Biden explained at the fundraiser.\u00a0ADADTrump has refused to retaliate against the Kremlin amid intelligence that the Russians offered bounties for the killing of U.S. troops in Afghanistan, claiming that he was never briefed and then saying there was not enough solid information to act. He has repeatedly cast doubt upon the value of NATO, berating Western European allies and announcing plans to withdraw thousands of U.S. troops from Germany. Trump also retreated from strategically valuable positions in Syria, allowing Russian forces to seize what had been American encampments. Trump has delivered a series of other geopolitical gifts to Putin during his three-and-a-half years in power.\u201cIn spite of President Trump\u2019s failure to act,\u201d Biden wrote in his statement, \u201cAmerica\u2019s adversaries must not misjudge the resolve of the American people to counter every effort by a foreign power to interfere in our democracy, whether by hacking voting systems and databases, laundering money into our political system, systematically spreading disinformation, or trying to sow doubt about the integrity of our elections.\u201dA Yale-educated historian now earning his doctorate at Oxford as a Marshall Scholar, Shimer\u2019s 384-page book chronicles a century of Russian election interference operations going back to 1919, as well as CIA operations in Italy, Chile and elsewhere during the Cold War. Using declassified archives, Shimer documents KGB efforts to undermine Ronald Reagan during his 1976 primary challenge against President Gerald Ford, who was under fire from the right for pursuing detente.\u00a0ADADThe Soviets were also determined that year to undermine then-Washington Sen. Henry \u201cScoop\u201d Jackson\u2019s bid for the Democratic presidential nomination because of his hawkish views. Russian operatives searched unsuccessfully for dirt on him and then forged documents in a bid to falsely frame Jackson as a closeted homosexual as part of what was code-named Operation Vice, according to Shimer. Russians mailed copies of the phony documents to newspapers like the Chicago Tribune and the Los Angeles Times, as well as senators like Frank Church (D-Idaho) and Ted Kennedy (D-Mass.), but no one did anything with them.In the pre-Internet era, and before the launch of pro-Trump cable networks like One America News, the mainstream media\u2019s filter successfully prevented the Russian disinformation campaign from catching on. As Shimer explains, there was a gap between the intent of Soviet leaders and their actual capabilities. The digital era made such operations vastly easier for the Russians.Shimer writes that previous presidential candidates, including Adlai Stevenson and Hubert Humphrey, rejected overtures from Russian ambassadors to support their campaigns during the Cold War, which kept the Kremlin from wading in more deeply than it otherwise might have into domestic politics.ADADIn contrast, former Trump national security adviser John Bolton alleges in his memoir that Trump privately asked Chinese leader Xi Jinping last year to help him win reelection, which the president has denied. Trump was impeached by the House in December for allegedly abusing his power by pushing Ukraine\u2019s president to announce an investigation of Biden in exchange for military assistance and a coveted White House meeting, but the Republican-controlled Senate voted to acquit him. During the summer of 2016, Trump publicly called on Russia to find emails on Clinton\u2019s server. He later claimed he was joking.\u00a0In June, a Ukrainian lawmaker who was once affiliated with a pro-Russian political party and has met with Trump\u2019s private lawyer Rudy Giuliani released 10 edited snippets of what appeared to be Biden\u2019s official vice presidential phone calls in 2016 with Petro Poroshenko, then the president of Ukraine. It was the second cache of recordings the lawmaker, who studied under the KGB in Moscow in the early 1990s, has released since May. The authenticity cannot be verified.In February, Trump decided not to nominate Joseph Maguire as director of national intelligence after an official on his staff told lawmakers during a classified briefing that the Russians want to see the president reelected.\u00a0ADADLast week, security officials in the United States, Britain and Canada jointly warned that hackers linked to a Russian intelligence service are trying to steal information from researchers working to produce coronavirus vaccines. The unit is one of the two Russian spy groups that penetrated the Democratic Party's computers in 2016.Biden adviser Tony Blinken, who was Obama\u2019s deputy secretary of state in 2016 and previously served as Biden\u2019s staff director when he chaired the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told Shimer for his book that \u201cclearly\u201d the Obama administration did not \u201cdo enough in terms of punishment\u201d for Russian interference during 2016.Former national security adviser Susan Rice, who was also deeply involved in deliberations over how and when to respond to Russian interference in 2016, is now being vetted by Biden as a potential running mate.\u00a0ADADIn an interview Monday night on the debut episode of Joy Reid\u2019s new MSNBC show, Biden declined to commit to picking an African American woman as his No. 2 but suggested that four of them remain under consideration. Sources with knowledge of the situation have told Sean Sullivan that the black women being vetted include Rice, Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), Rep. Val Demings (D-Fla.), Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms and Rep. Karen Bass (D-Calif.). Failed Georgia gubernatorial nominee Stacey Abrams has aggressively campaigned for the job, but insiders say her stock fell as the search progressed.Biden said on MSNBC that the detailed vetting \u201cis just being finished,\u201d and lawyers are presenting him with two-hour briefings on each of the women under consideration. \u201cWe\u2019ve gone through about four candidates so far,\u201d he said, adding that he will \u201cnarrow the list\u201d and then have \u201cpersonal discussions with each of the candidates who are left and make a decision.\u201d\u00a0During the interview, Biden made sure to reiterate his call for Russia not to mess with the election. \u201cPutin knows I mean what I say,\u201d he said.The coronavirusE.U. leaders agreed this morning to an $859 billion coronavirus plan.After 90 hours of negotiations over four days in Brussels, the 27 members of the bloc transcended deep-seated divisions to agree to a compromise to rescue the economies of coronavirus-ravaged countries. \u201cThe main disagreement between the leaders of a handful of self-dubbed \u2018frugal\u2019 countries \u2014 the Netherlands, Sweden, Austria, Denmark and Finland \u2014 and their peers was about how much money to ship to hard-hit countries such as Italy and Spain and how much oversight donor countries ought to have over how the funds are spent,\u201d Michael Birnbaum, Quentin Ari\u00e8s and Loveday Morris report. \u201cTo appease them, the portion of grants in the deal was trimmed to $358 billion and the objectors were granted billions more in rebates from their contribution to the shared E.U. budget. \u2026 In a win for Hungary and Poland, stipulations that tied access to funds to upholding the rule of law were rolled back in the final draft. Both countries have been censured by Brussels as their leaders have moved against their political opponents and stripped the independence of the judiciary.\u201dThe GOP's relief proposal will probably include payroll tax cuts and tie school money to reopening plans.\u00a0\u201cSome of these provisions are already sparking pushback from key Senate Republicans, and an even bigger showdown with Democrats appears inevitable,\u201d Erica Werner, Jeff Stein, Robert Costa and Seung Min Kim report. \u201cThat clash could come Tuesday, when Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows are set to meet with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) for the first bipartisan talks on what will almost certainly be the last major coronavirus relief bill before the November elections. Mnuchin and Meadows will also meet with Senate Republicans on Tuesday as they seek to quell any discontent. \u2026 Mnuchin said Monday that the White House wants the bill to amount to roughly $1 trillion in new programs, though officials are expected to use budget gimmicks to make the initial package slightly larger. Still, Democrats were looking for a much bigger bill. Their opening offer is a $3 trillion package they passed in May that would extend unemployment benefits, include new stimulus checks, and help cities and states, among other things.\u201dFollow the money: A bipartisan group of lawmakers called for scrutiny of a $700 million Treasury Department \"loan\" to the trucking company YRC Worldwide.\u00a0\u201cIn its latest report, the Covid-19 Congressional Oversight Commission expressed concern that taxpayers were likely to lose money on the loan, noting concerns about YRC\u2019s financial viability,\u201d Jeff Stein and Erica Werner report.Reps. Joe Kennedy (D-Mass.) and Michael Burgess (R-Tex.), members of the House subcommittee that will question officials from vaccine makers Pfizer, Merck, Johnson & Johnson, AstraZeneca and Moderna today, hold shares in at least one of those companies.

(STAT)American lab giant Quest Diagnostics warned that it will be impossible to increase covid-19 testing capacity to cope with demand this fall due to the flu season. (Financial Times)\u00a0\u201cA University of Oxford group and the British-Swedish pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca reported Monday that their coronavirus vaccine candidate, on which the U.S. and European governments have placed substantial bets, was shown in early-stage human trials to be safe and to stimulate a strong immune response,\u201d William Booth and Carolyn Johnson report. \u201cThe study, published in the British medical journal the Lancet and involving 1,077 volunteers, was described as promising. A second report in the same publication on a Chinese vaccine showed what researchers not involved in the study described as modest positive results. \u2026 Large-scale, real-world trials of the Oxford vaccine \u2014 named ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 \u2014 are underway in Britain, Brazil and South Africa. The United States plans to test it later this summer, along with a handful of other candidates, in clinical trials, each with about 30,000 volunteers.\u201dHundreds are camping out in Oklahoma\u2019s unemployment lines.\u00a0\u201cJohn Jolley never thought he'd be sleeping in his car awaiting unemployment benefits. But there he was, the owner of a once-successful advertising agency, taking a sweaty nap in a Subaru wagon in a convention center parking lot at 1:45 a.m. on a Wednesday. The pandemic sent his business into a free fall, and now Jolley wanted to be first in line for an unemployment claims event beginning in five hours. He barely dozed, afraid that if he fell into a deep sleep, he would miss the early-morning handout of tickets for appointments with state agents. There would be just 400 tickets handed out for that day\u2019s event. When those ran out, there would be 400 more for appointments the following day,\u201d Annie Gowen reports. \u201cIn Oklahoma, one of the poorest states, unemployment \u2014 which reached a record 14.7 percent in April \u2014 has pushed many to the point of desperation, with savings depleted, cars repossessed and homes sold for cash. Even though the unemployment rate dropped to 6.6 percent in June, the backlog has created unprecedented delays. Oklahoma had approved 235,000 of about 590,000 filed claims by June 21 \u2014 a total $2.4 billion payout, far more than in previous years. About 6,000 state claims are pending.\u00a0\u201cThe Oklahoma Employment Security Commission staff has tried to combat the delays by holding mega-processing events at large arenas in Oklahoma City and Tulsa this month, with masks and social distancing required. So far, they\u2019ve managed to help 6,200 people. \u2026 Shelley Zumwalt, the interim director of Oklahoma\u2019s unemployment agency, said the state\u2019s system uses a mainframe computer from 1978 that was quickly overwhelmed by the volume of claims.\u201dArizona has become ground zero for the human and economic carnage of reopening too soon.\u00a0\u201cLike Florida, Texas and others that opened early, Arizona now ranks as one of the country\u2019s worst coronavirus hot spots, with more than 143,000 cases and more than 2,700 deaths as of this weekend. Some residents in cities such as Phoenix and Scottsdale say the surge is the result of the state\u2019s return to old routines, after Republican Gov. Doug Ducey lifted his stay-at-home order in May in part to give the local economy a boost,\u201d Tony Romm reports. \u201cNearly 1 million Arizonans \u2026 are set to lose extra money in unemployment assistance after this week, leaving them with benefits that are much lower than most other states.\u201d\u00a0The pandemic orphaned three children who are now struggling to cope with grief and bills. \u00a0\u201cThe family had come to the United States eight years earlier after escaping Iraq, a country that had grown increasingly dangerous for Chaldean Catholics like them,\u201d John Woodrow Cox reports. Their parents, Nada, 46, and Nameer, 52, passed away from the virus after being in the hospital for over a month, 20 days apart. Now, the two oldest children, Nash and Nadeen, have had to push their grief aside to focus on keeping their family afloat. \u201c[Nash] opened his first bank account, then applied for unemployment and tried to figure out whether Nadeen might be eligible, too. He decided to use the donations to pay off the house, ensuring that he and his siblings would always have a place to live. \u2026 Like Nash, Nadeen struggled at first, burning a pot of red rice she tried to cook and bleaching her brother\u2019s clothes in the wash. She wanted to help, though, and intended to get her driver\u2019s license and keep pursuing her college degree. She\u2019d heard physical therapists made good money, and that was important because, along with Nash, she\u2019d agreed to serve as [their little] sister\u2019s guardian.\"Trump will bring back coronavirus briefings in an attempt to revive his reelection campaign.\u201cAs the number of infected Americans surges and as Trump\u2019s coronavirus-related approval ratings plummet, the president is pledging to \u2018get involved\u2019 in the daily messaging campaign in a more direct way by returning to the stage where he headlined controversial news conferences in March and April,\u201d Toluse Olorunnipa and Josh Dawsey report. \u201c\u2018I think it\u2019s a great way to get information out to the public as to where we are with the vaccines, with the therapeutics, and, generally speaking, where we are,\u2019 Trump told reporters Monday. \u2018I\u2019ll do it at 5 o\u2019clock, like we were doing. We had a good slot. And a lot of people were watching.\u2019 \u2026 While some Republicans criticized the briefings in March and April as unfocused and unhelpful, others welcomed the news Monday that the president would be publicly returning his attention to the pandemic, which now sits atop the list of issues most pressing to voters.\u201dIn a dark portent for U.S. movie theaters, Warner Bros. postponed the domestic release of the Christopher Nolan movie \u201cTenet.\u201d With cases surging in the U.S., no major new films are likely to be released in the country until at least September.

What\u2019s in the law?It requires the State Department, in consultation with the Treasury, to report on and establish penalties for foreign persons and entities who have \u201cmaterially\u201d contributed to undermining Hong Kong\u2019s \u201cone country, two systems\u201d framework. It gives the president the power to block assets and deny U.S. entry to those involved.AD2. How are banks drawn in?The legislation allows for penalties on foreign financial institutions that knowingly do business with sanctioned individuals. Big U.S. banks are at risk since their foreign subsidiaries may have Chinese officials, their relatives and associates as customers. Investment banks get a big chunk of their Chinese revenue from stock sales, financing for companies and big shareholders. Commercial and retail banks in the U.S. could be even more exposed because most global transactions are done in U.S. dollars and flow through the U.S. banking system. The report on banks will be submitted after individuals are disclosed, giving lenders time to adjust.AD3. What are the penalties?ADBanks singled out could face a cascade of sanctions, including a block on assets, restrictions on access to loans from U.S. institutions, bans on being a primary dealer in U.S. debt, conducting foreign exchange and banking transactions as well penalties on executives among others, according to the bill.4. What\u2019s at stake?The five big U.S. banks had a combined $71 billion of exposure to China in 2019, with JPMorgan clocking the biggest investment at $19 billion. They now could also face the risk of a tit-for-tat if China chooses to retaliate, clouding their growth plans and threatening income they have generated over the years from advising giants such as Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. Profits in China\u2019s brokerage industry could hit $47 billion by 2026, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. estimates, with foreign firms gunning for a considerable share. Insurers, asset managers and commercial banks are also pushing into China. Spokespeople at Citigroup, JPMorgan and HSBC declined to comment.ADAD5. How worried are they?While the U.S. has broad authority to impose penalties under the act, the initial fallout may be limited to the most senior Chinese officials since the U.S. is unlikely to take action that will significantly disrupt trade or hurt the global economy, according to estimates from bank executives who asked not to be identified discussing an internal analysis.6. What are banks doing now?Global banks are reviewing their client base to identify people who may be exposed to sanctions and looking over agreements to make sure that they have clauses that allow them to ditch customers without penalty. Once the sanction list is released, banks will need to ensure they have effective procedures to cut ties with those individuals.AD7. What about Chinese banks?China\u2019s biggest state-owned lenders, led by Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd., are the most exposed given their close ties to the country\u2019s government officials. Severing those links would be difficult, if not impossible. Chinese lenders have $1.1 trillion in dollar funding at stake, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. If they are sanctioned, the president can also ban U.S. investors from holding equity or debt in the lenders.AD8. Can companies be sanctioned?Yes, sanctions would also apply to entities. A broad application to companies, especially ones that have a significant footprint in China or Hong Kong, would pose a greater risk to global banks because it can be harder to untangle those relationships. Banks will likely be prohibited from doing business with a company that\u2019s 50% or more controlled by a sanctioned individual, according to Office of Foreign Assets Control guidance.AD9. What\u2019s the timing?Starting July 14, when President Donald Trump signed it, the State Department has 90 days to submit a report on whether any individuals or companies merit sanctions. Reports on financial institutions must be submitted within 60 days after that. The president has the leeway to wait one year before imposing sanctions.10. How is China reacting?It vowed to take strong countermeasures and sanction U.S. officials and entities over the Hong Kong law, without elaborating. It urged the U.S. to \u201ccorrect its wrongdoings\u201d and to stop interfering in Hong Kong affairs.(Earlier story corrected a number in the fourth section.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P.", "comment": "1 Comments", "topic": "Business"}, {"cover": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/5VEG2JWE6MI6VD76G4V6RWBCTA.jpghttps://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/5VEG2JWE6MI6VD76G4V6RWBCTA.jpg", "title": "For U.S. tech firms, doing business in Hong Kong is suddenly a whole lot riskier", "date": "Jul 14, 2020", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/for-us-tech-firms-doing-business-in-hong-kong-is-suddenly-a-whole-lot-riskier/2020/07/14/ab493a5c-c4aa-11ea-a825-8722004e4150_story.html", "keyword": "China and Security", "website": "the Washington Post", "author": "Shibani Mahtani", "content": "HONG KONG \u2014 Touting her city's credentials as a base for tech start-ups, Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam told entrepreneurs last week that she needed to \"dispel some misrepresentations\" about a wide-ranging security law that had just taken effect.Support our journalism.

The same week, Google, Facebook and Twitter said they would stop processing data requests from Hong Kong authorities, pending a human rights assessment of the law. In Silicon Valley boardrooms, tech executives were going further, their employees said, debating whether their workers might face arrest for noncompliance.ADAD\"It is a different era for Hong Kong,\" said an official at a large U.S. tech company. The company is \"gravely concerned about the way in which China has conducted itself.\"Spooked by a law that takes aim at Hong Kong's previously unrestricted Internet, tech giants are scrambling for legal expertise on how to navigate a market that has changed fundamentally.Under the \"one country, two systems\" framework, Hong Kong's Internet landscape has been largely untouched by censorship and digital surveillance from mainland China. Google, Facebook and other U.S. social media companies are blocked in China, but have operated freely in Hong Kong. Google and Facebook have staff in Hong Kong.ADThe Washington Post spoke to employees at several U.S. tech companies who requested anonymity to discuss sensitive political matters. At least one tech company has shelved plans for future investment in Hong Kong, a business consultant said.ADTech firms admit that pausing data requests is a temporary solution \u2014 a \"way to buy time,\" as one employee at a U.S. social media company put it. In grappling with Hong Kong's new reality, analysts say, companies will have to weigh their approach and values against their interest in the Chinese market, a trade-off that has long dogged Silicon Valley.\"People like to pretend that you can be operational in China and not compliant with Chinese law, and that's just not a realistic possibility,\" said Matt Perault, director of the Center on Science and Technology Policy at Duke University and former director of public policy at Facebook. \"A pause is not a long-term solution.\"Facebook, Google, Twitter halt review of Hong Kong requests for dataSamm Sacks, a senior fellow at Yale Law School's Paul Tsai China Center, added that technology companies must adjust to the reality that the \"one country, two systems\" framework under which Hong Kong was supposed to largely govern itself is \"no longer a backstop and doesn't get them out of dealing with China.\"ADAD\"On one hand, what do you do if the Chinese government comes to us with a request for data that will lead to an arrest?\" Sacks said. \"And on the other hand, what is the cost if we pull out entirely and suddenly these platforms are no longer available in an environment where free speech really matters?\"Widening censorshipWhen Beijing imposed the national security law by fiat, bypassing Hong Kong's political processes, it put the city's 7.5 million residents under the same draconian speech controls as mainland China. The law criminalizes four broad offenses \u2014 separatism, subversion, terrorism and foreign collusion \u2014 and sets out sentences of up to life imprisonment. Implementation rules released several days later granted police sweeping powers to seize servers, block websites and raid the offices of publishers and Internet companies. Police can also force technology companies to help decrypt information.ADADA spokesman for the Hong Kong Police Force, responding to a request for comment, said police will continue to request information or cooperation from \"relevant persons or organizations\" but will make these requests only when necessary for performing enforcement duties and in accordance with the law.Even before the new law, Hong Kong authorities had been ramping up data requests, transparency reports show. Google received 39 requests from Hong Kong's government to remove 62 items from its platforms between July and December 2019. Google removed 10 items. In the preceding six months, the company received 13 requests for content removal. Some that Google rejected included requests from police to pull an app from the Google Play store that displays the locations of police and protesters, and a demand to take down a YouTube video by hacktivist group Anonymous calling on protesters to stay vigilant.Facebook received 241 requests from July to December 2019, up from 143 in the six months prior. It complied in fewer than half of the instances.ADADAnalysts and tech executives say the new law has made it clear that Beijing wants to extend its digital censorship and surveillance to Hong Kong, creating an environment where it is impossible for companies to operate by their principles of free speech. Tech companies are hoping to avoid a repeat of 2004, when Yahoo provided information that led to the prosecution of a Chinese journalist who was found guilty of leaking state secrets.\"The politics at this point is more important than the legal aspects of the law,\" said the employee at the U.S. social media company. \"The target is moving. They are looking to implement this in real ways.\"With Hong Kong security law, China writes broad international powers for itselfThe business consultant said a tech company made contact after the law came into force, alarmed by its sweeping nature. Of particular concern, the consultant said, was the law's extraterritorial application. Assurances that the law would not be retroactive have not convinced this company either, the consultant said, given that Hong Kong libraries have started to remove books by prominent activists that were written and published before the law was put in place.ADADCharles Mok, a pro-democracy lawmaker who represents the IT industry, said the companies that declared they would halt compliance with data requests represented just a fraction of businesses that could be tripped up by the law, pointing to telecom companies, Internet service providers and cloud hosting services. Mok noted that Amazon Web Services launched its Hong Kong operations just last year. (Jeff Bezos is the founder and chief executive of Amazon and the owner of The Post.) Amazon declined to comment.Authorities have drafted rules \"without talking to the industry about feasibility and have created a whole range of uncertainties and liabilities,\" Mok said.An 'elaborate dance'Among the companies plowing ahead in Hong Kong is Uber, which plans to move its Asia-Pacific headquarters to the city if officials legalize ride-hailing, according to people familiar with the matter. While Uber operates in Hong Kong, ride-hailing is not legal, and drivers face penalties for using the app.ADADThe company is on a public relations blitz, promoting its Uber Eats food-delivery service in Hong Kong and recently launching Uber Transit, a feature that enables commuters to assess public transportation options using real-time arrival data. Uber has also created a website for people to petition lawmakers to change ride-sharing regulations.Uber has publicly lauded Hong Kong's approach to the coronavirus pandemic and says it is bullish about the city's future. Privately, Uber executives have pitched the company as a potential poster child in discussions with the Hong Kong government, promising investment and jobs when other companies are shelving expansions or planning exits.\"The thinking is that Uber wouldn't be a target if it demonstrates itself as one of the good guys,\" said a person familiar with the company's thinking. Uber declined to comment, pointing The Post to a prior statement announcing a decision to move its operational headquarters to a new regional location.ADADThe security law states that anyone who provides \"support\" or \"assistance\" to a terrorist or terrorist group \u2014 including transportation \u2014 can be guilty of an offense. Many Uber drivers gave anti-government protesters rides home last year, helping them to avoid police action.Sacks observed that many American tech companies have limited understanding of how to operate in China because they have no real footprint there, other than small advertising businesses or stakes in Chinese firms. Companies like Microsoft that have operated there for years, she said, have developed \"savvy strategies\" to figure out how to play an \"elaborate dance\" with the Chinese government, allowing them to comply without crossing red lines.\"But companies like Facebook and Twitter have no experience doing this inside China. They are babies inside a place where they are not prepared for the implications,\" she said. \"Are they prepared to push back \u2014 do they even know how?\"\n\nFacebook, Google, Twitter halt review of Hong Kong requests for dataWith Hong Kong security law, China writes broad international powers for itself", "comment": "40 Comments", "topic": "Asia & Pacific"}, {"cover": "", "title": "After 99 days of success, virus returns to haunt Vietnam", "date": "Jul 29, 2020", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/vietnam-imposes-more-virus-restrictions-as-outbreak-spreads/2020/07/29/f0dcf588-d213-11ea-826b-cc394d824e35_story.html", "keyword": "China and Security", "website": "the Washington Post", "author": "", "content": "HANOI, Vietnam \u2014 For 99 days, Vietnam seemed to have defeated the coronavirus.

The country of 96 million people was hailed globally as a standout success.Support our journalism. Subscribe today.arrow-rightBut then a week ago, an outbreak began that has now grown to 48 cases in six parts of the country, including three of the largest cities, and forced authorities to reimpose restrictions many thought they had put behind them. And experts worry the outbreak could be much larger than currently known.The outbreak began last Thursday in the picturesque coastal city of Da Nang, where thousands of tourists were taking their summer vacations on golden beaches. A 57-year-old man was hospitalized with a fever and tested positive. His condition soon worsened and he was put on a ventilator.ADADHealth authorities swung into action. But the man\u2019s case was puzzling. He hadn\u2019t left his hometown for over a month and tests on his family and 100 other possible contacts all came back negative.Then health workers found three other infections in Da Nang over the weekend. And then on Monday, another 11. All of those were other patients or health workers at the Da Nang Hospital, where the man remains in critical condition.On Monday, authorities encouraged 80,000 tourists to leave the city by providing extra flights. Hotels emptied out and thousands canceled their plans to visit.Then on Tuesday, the city was put into lockdown. The packed beaches were closed, roamed only by patrolling security guards. But the order of events left some scratching their heads. Surely the fleeing tourists had the potential to spread the virus further?ADADIndeed by Thursday, authorities had found 43 cases, including two people in the capital, Hanoi. All of the cases seemed to link back to Da Nang and returning travelers.The cases included an American who had been a patient last week at Da Nang Hospital before moving to another hospital in Ho Chi Minh City in the south. His companion also tested positive.Authorities are now reimposing broader restrictions. They\u2019re closing nonessential services and banning large public gatherings in Da Nang and other nearby cities, and closing bars and clubs in Hanoi. They\u2019re also planning to test 21,000 people in the capital who recently returned from Da Nang.Pham Hien, owner of a noodle restaurant in Hanoi, said she will no longer have seated guests and instead will offer only takeout service or deliveries. She said her business is hurting but she will abide by government recommendations.ADAD\u201cWhat is important now is that all citizens join hands together with the government in this fight,\u201d she said.Just how the virus crept back remains a mystery. Authorities say they think the source was from outside Vietnam because this time the virus is a different strain.\u201cOne big difference I\u2019ve noticed between this wave and the previous one is that the cases we have right now, a lot of them are severe,\u201d said Marc Choisy, a Hanoi-based bio-mathematician with the Oxford University Clinical Research Unit.He said such a high proportion of severe cases could indicate that hundreds more asymptomatic cases remain undetected in the community.\u201cIt\u2019s very likely the disease is transmitting silently at the moment,\u201d he said.ADThe government, meanwhile, has been cracking down on people being smuggled into the country to avoid quarantine, making a string of arrests in cases of smuggled Chinese nationals. But authorities have yet to make any direct links between the people smuggling and the new outbreak.ADVietnam\u2019s struggle to contain the virus even after its initial success has been reflected in other places around the world. Australia was down to single-digit daily increases when an outbreak exploded in the city of Melbourne this month. On Thursday, authorities reported more than 700 new cases in and around Melbourne, a record. Other places from Hong Kong to Spain are battling new outbreaks after seemingly having the virus under control.Vietnam\u2019s quick actions in the face of its latest outbreak reflect the speed with which the government reacted to the initial virus threat, which experts say helped halt its spread.ADIn mid-February, for example, Vietnam put all 10,000 residents of the town of Son Loi, near Hanoi, under a three-week lockdown, even though there were only 16 confirmed cases in the entire country at that time.ADThe Communist government also used texts and social media to deliver concise instructions to its citizens. It even added short messages to every phone call.By March 22, Vietnam had essentially closed itself off to the outside world, stopping most international flights and shutting down the 900-mile (1,440-kilometer) land border it shares with China.Whenever authorities saw even a single case of community transmission, they jumped on it with contact tracing, lockdowns and widespread testing. The country also drew on its past experience defeating the SARS outbreak in 2003 and was able to limit its confirmed coronavirus cases before the recent outbreak to just 416.ADBut Choisy, the bio-mathematician, worries authorities have caught this coronavirus wave much later in its cycle than the first wave.AD\u201cWhen you haven\u2019t heard about new virus cases for a while, you begin to forget very quickly and you return to normal life,\u201d Choisy said. \u201cYou get used to it.\u201d___Associated Press science writer Victoria Milko in Jakarta, Indonesia, and reporter Nick Perry in Wellington, New Zealand, contributed to this report.___The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Department of Science Education.

President Donald Trump, punishing China for moves to tighten its grip on the city after a year of pro-democracy street protests, says Hong Kong\u2019s special status is now a thing of the past. At its most extreme, that could mean the global financial hub is treated the same as any other Chinese city -- a seismic shift that could harm both economies at an already difficult time.Support our journalism. Subscribe today.arrow-right1. What did Trump do?He announced on July 14 that he had signed an executive order ending Hong Kong\u2019s special status. His administration had telegraphed the move for weeks. On May 27, Secretary of State Michael Pompeo notified Congress that the White House no longer regarded Hong Kong as autonomous from mainland China. On June 29, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said that meant the special status had been revoked.ADAD2. What\u2019s the impact?In the short term, the White House said that holders of Hong Kong passports will lose some special privileges -- until now, they\u2019ve been exempt from certain requirements on mainland Chinese who travel to the U.S. He also said Hong Kong will lose some benefits related to U.S. exports. But Trump offered no specifics about the broader impact of his order, including what it means for tariffs and for Hong Kong\u2019s financial industry. Earlier, Pompeo had announced visa restrictions against unspecified Chinese officials and said the U.S. would cease selling defense equipment to Hong Kong, a largely symbolic act that will mostly affect the city\u2019s police and corrections forces. In deciding how far to go, Trump has to weigh consequences for the U.S. economy, including the U.S.-China trade deal that Trump had considered one of his biggest achievements and which could affect his odds of winning re-election.3. What\u2019s at stake for Hong Kong and China?ADADWhile Hong Kong remains a gateway from China to the rest of the world, it matters far less to the mainland\u2019s fortunes than it once did. In 2019, 12% of China\u2019s exports went to or through Hong Kong, down from 45% in 1992. China is also far less reliant on inflows of foreign capital and expertise, and made a lower priority of making the yuan an international currency -- although it has renewed the push as tensions with the U.S. have risen. Regardless, the city still matters. Hong Kong\u2019s open capital account and adherence to international standards of governance are unmatched by any mainland Chinese city and make it an important base for international banks and trading firms. A revocation of its special status would mark \u201cthe beginning of the death of Hong Kong as we know it,\u201d Steve Tsang, director of the University of London\u2019s SOAS China Institute, said last year.4. And their financial markets?If the U.S. treats Hong Kong no differently than any other Chinese city, would ratings firms and investors do the same? That\u2019s a question posed by Deutsche Bank, which noted that S&P Global Ratings has Hong Kong three notches above China while Moody\u2019s and Fitch have Hong Kong one notch higher. The risk is that China\u2019s own rating gets lowered in coming years and drags Hong Kong\u2019s down with it. At the same time, equity index providers may take a fresh look at Hong Kong, which is currently in the MSCI World Index with other developed markets. China is in the emerging market index, raising the question, should Hong Kong be treated the same as Shanghai and Shenzhen?ADAD5. What\u2019s at stake for the U.S.?It has its own reasons for not rocking the boat too much. Hong Kong, the only semi-democratic jurisdiction under Chinese rule, offers U.S. companies a relatively safe way to access the Chinese market and employs a U.S. dollar peg, linking it with the American financial system. According to the Congressional Research Service, the largest U.S. trade surplus in 2019 was with Hong Kong \u2014 $36 billion. Hong Kong counted 278 U.S. companies with regional headquarters in the city that year and another 457 with offices. Hong Kong\u2019s first justice minister after the handover to China in 1997, Elsie Leung, told the South China Morning Post in May that any damage would be mutual: \u201cWe are not just getting the benefits \u2013 it\u2019s a free-trade arrangement which is good for both sides.\u201d6. How has China responded?ADADThe Foreign Ministry has promised unspecified retaliation against what it terms foreign interference, insisting Hong Kong is purely an internal affair. China said last year it would sanction some U.S.-based activist groups including the National Endowment for Democracy, Human Rights Watch and Freedom House, and suspend port visits by U.S. Navy ships to Hong Kong. The official Xinhua News Agency has dismissed as \u201cgroundless\u201d accusations about the loss of freedom or human rights issues in Hong Kong. It also noted that the 2018 Human Freedom Index compiled by the Fraser Institute, a Vancouver-based think tank, ranked Hong Kong at No. 3, well ahead of the U.S. at No. 17.7. And Hong Kong?The city\u2019s leader, Chief Executive Carrie Lam, has said it\u2019s \u201ctotally unacceptable\u201d for foreign legislatures to interfere in Hong Kong\u2019s internal affairs, and that sanctions would only complicate the city\u2019s problems. (Lam was selected in 2017 by a committee of 1,200 political insiders overwhelmingly loyal to the Chinese government.) She has sought to reassure investors that the city still adheres to the rule of law and has an independent judiciary. She also has defended police actions.ADAD8. Is this what the pro-democracy protesters have been seeking?As a largely leaderless movement, the Hong Kong protests have made no official request for international assistance. But some prominent activists including Jimmy Lai and Joshua Wong called on Trump to hit China hard with sanctions. Wong had testified last year in Washington in favor of putting pressure on China. On the streets of Hong Kong, some protesters have made clear their interest in U.S. support by waving American flags, singing \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner\u201d and calling on Trump to \u201cliberate\u201d Hong Kong. Such rallying cries are now illegal in Hong Kong under the new national security law.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P.", "comment": "0 Comments", "topic": "Business"}, {"cover": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/XKJKVIWQ7UI6VEBYV4EJWY5MEE.jpghttps://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/XKJKVIWQ7UI6VEBYV4EJWY5MEE.jpg", "title": "Young people are infecting older family members in shared homes", "date": "Jul 29, 2020", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/young-people-are-infecting-older-family-members-in-shared-homes/2020/07/28/b8cdc810-cd0a-11ea-b0e3-d55bda07d66a_story.html", "keyword": "China and Security", "website": "the Washington Post", "author": "Lenny Bernstein", "content": "Please NoteThe Washington Post is providing this important information about the coronavirus for free.

To support this work, please subscribe to the Post.As the death toll escalates in coronavirus hot spots, evidence is growing that young people who work outside the home, or who surged into bars and restaurants when states relaxed shutdowns, are infecting their more vulnerable elders, especially family members.Front-line caregivers, elected officials and experts in Houston, South Florida and elsewhere say they are seeing patterns of hospitalization and death that confirm fears this would happen, which were first raised in May and June. That was when Florida, Texas, Arizona, California and other states reopened in efforts to revive their flagging economies.The emerging trend highlights the difficulty of relying on the Trump administration\u2019s strategy of sheltering the most vulnerable while the young and healthy return to work and school. That approach runs the risk of transmitting the virus when two or three generations share the same home and when many lower-income workers have little choice but to brave exposure to do their jobs.ADADYoung adults are among the essential workers who may be returning home to parents and grandparents. High school and college-age children may expose teachers, parents and grandparents.Sooner or later, doctors said, most older people and those with underlying health problems will mix with the younger generation.\u201cWe think when Texas started opening up, that was May\u00a01, it was young people going to bars and restaurants, out and about, gathering socially,\u201d said Pat Herlihy, chief of critical care at Baylor St. Luke\u2019s Medical Center in Houston. \u201cMy hypothesis now is that they\u2019re engaging with the larger families, they\u2019re engaging with the 60- to 70-year-olds \u2014 parents uncles, aunts. They\u2019re engaging much more with that vulnerable population.\u201dADEthnically diverse parts of the Sun Belt, where caseloads are climbing fast, are home to a larger share of multigenerational families who live together than other sections of the United States. A record 64\u00a0million people \u2014 about 20\u00a0percent of the U.S. population \u2014 lived in homes with at least two adult generations or grandparents and grandchildren under 25 in 2016, according to an analysis of census data by the Pew Research Center.ADThat is even more true for Hispanics, who have large populations in Florida, the Southwest and California. About 27\u00a0percent live in multigenerational households. The figure is similar for Black people (26\u00a0percent) and Asians (29\u00a0percent), Pew found.The pandemic and its accompanying economic hardship also have forced some younger adults back into their parents\u2019 homes.It is impossible to know how any person acquires the coronavirus, and with community transmission rampant across the Sun Belt, people can become infected in a variety of ways. So discussion of intergenerational transmission involves some speculation, as well as epidemiological modeling and research.ADTo date, more than 4.2\u00a0million people in the United States have been infected by the virus that causes covid-19, and more than 145,000 have died. The number of new U.S. cases hovered around 70,000 each day last week, with deaths exceeding 1,000 on four straight days. Florida and California set their own death records on some days, with more than 100\u00a0in each state.ADIn a heartfelt tale that has been seen around the globe, a Florida woman took to Facebook earlier this month to say she believes her 21-year-old stepson had infected her, her husband and their two younger children after he spent time with friends who were not wearing masks or social distancing. The father, 42-year-old John Place, spent 18\u00a0days on a ventilator before doctors were able to wean him from the device nearly two weeks ago, Michelle Zymet of Plantation, Fla., said in an interview Saturday. But Place is still seriously ill, hospitalized and suffering the debilitating effects of covid-19, Zymet said.AD\u201cI pleaded with him, every day,\u201d Zymet said of her stepson. \u201cI was that maniac. \u2018Please wear your mask. Hand sanitizer. Social distance.\u2019\u2009\u201dYounger adults need to understand that \u201cyou don\u2019t live in a bubble,\u201d she said. \u201cYou have to think about everybody in the community. Don\u2019t just think about yourself.\u201dADIn a post on her Facebook page, Zymet also said she was not \u201ctrying to bash my stepson or put this immense amount of guilt on him. \u2026 He feels terrible for what has happened and just wants others not to make the same mistake he did!\u201dOn Monday, the White House announced that national security adviser Robert C. O\u2019Brien had contracted the coronavirus. O\u2019Brien probably caught the virus from his daughter, said chief economic adviser Larry Kudlow. No further details were available.ADPeople in their 20s and 30s die of covid-19 in much smaller numbers than those 60 and older, and at first the death toll in the Sun Belt did not keep pace with infections. Now, however, epidemiologists\u2019 prediction of a follow-up surge in fatalities is bearing out.The question is why.Experts note that younger people are disproportionately asymptomatic when they become infected, so some may not know they are bringing it home.ADPeter Paige, chief medical officer for Miami\u2019s Jackson Health System, said that a month ago, about 40\u00a0percent of the people hospitalized for covid-19 in the system\u2019s three facilities were 65 or older. Now that proportion has climbed to about 55\u00a0percent.ADAbout 60 to 65\u00a0percent of the people now dying of covid-19 are in that age range \u2014 a figure approaching the proportions of the early days of the pandemic, he said.In Jackson\u2019s emergency departments, meanwhile, 85 to 90\u00a0percent of covid-19 patients are younger than 65, Paige said. Many do not need to be admitted.\u201cIt appears there\u2019s a lot more positivity coming in the younger population, but it seems like a lot of the deaths are coming in that high-risk population,\u201d he said.In recent days, the mayors of Miami, Miami-Dade County and Broward County said household transmission has become a critical factor in that area\u2019s outbreak.AD\u201cI would tell our residents \u2026 that they should consider, particularly if they have a multigenerational household, wearing masks indoors at times \u2026 and also respecting social distance when they\u2019re at home,\u201d Miami Mayor Francis Suarez (R) said at a news conference last week.ADMiami-Dade County Mayor Carlos A. Gim\u00e9nez (R) also urged people to distance themselves from family members who may carry the virus without seeming to be sick.\u201cYes, I know it\u2019s a sacrifice,\u201d he said, \u201cbut do so because, again, just because it\u2019s your son, or your daughter, or your cousin, or your mother, or your father, doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t have covid.\u201dRecent research on household transmission is mixed. Researchers who studied household contacts in Guangzhou, China, in January and February estimated that close relatives living in the same home passed on the virus to about 1 in 8 members of their household, according to research published last month in the journal Lancet Infectious Diseases.ADADBut a separate statistical analysis of eight European countries earlier this month in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences found no conclusive evidence that intergenerational relationships affected the spread or severity of the pandemic in those places.In Tennessee, data analyzed by John Graves, an associate professor of health policy at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, showed an increase in infections among young adults in the Nashville and Memphis areas. Graves attributed the surge to that age group returning to downtown bars as the shutdown eased and, later, to Fourth of July gatherings.Now the data is starting to indicate that older adults are also becoming infected.\u201cWhat that is suggestive of is that initial seeding is now starting to spread to older generations,\u201d he said.ADThe trend is not universal. In Los Angeles, which is experiencing a huge growth in cases, the outbreak still appears to be concentrated among younger adults, said Neha Nanda, medical director of infection prevention and antimicrobial stewardship at Keck Medicine of USC.The median age of people admitted to area hospitals during the first surge was about 60, while this time it is between 35 and 40, she said. Many young adults with covid-19 are sent home from emergency departments and testing sites because their symptoms are mild, she said.\u201cI think it\u2019s not happening as of yet,\u201d Nanda said of older adults showing up at hospitals. \u201cI would not exclude that possibility.\u201dCalifornia nevertheless set a record for deaths two days in a row last week, including 159\u00a0on Friday.\n\n", "comment": "1.1k Comments", "topic": "Health"}, {"cover": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/SIA6PAGGHUI6VKBFQ4RAATSBKA.jpghttps://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/SIA6PAGGHUI6VKBFQ4RAATSBKA.jpg", "title": "What Hong Kong Losing Its \u2018Special Status\u2019 Would Mean", "date": "Jul 15, 2020", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/what-hong-kong-losing-its-special-status-would-mean/2020/07/14/92dae5bc-c63d-11ea-a825-8722004e4150_story.html", "keyword": "China and Security", "website": "the Washington Post", "author": "", "content": "Under the United States-Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992, the U.S. treated Hong Kong, a semi-autonomous part of China with its own legal and economic system, differently than the Chinese mainland in trade, commerce and other areas. President Donald Trump, punishing China for moves to tighten its grip on the city after a year of pro-democracy street protests, says Hong Kong\u2019s special status is now a thing of the past. At its most extreme, that could mean the global financial hub is treated the same as any other Chinese city -- a seismic shift that could harm both economies at an already difficult time.Support our journalism.

His administration had telegraphed the move for weeks. On May 27, Secretary of State Michael Pompeo notified Congress that the White House no longer regarded Hong Kong as autonomous from mainland China. On June 29, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said that meant the special status had been revoked.ADAD2. What\u2019s the impact?In the short term, the White House said that holders of Hong Kong passports will lose some special privileges -- until now, they\u2019ve been exempt from certain requirements on mainland Chinese who travel to the U.S. He also said Hong Kong will lose some benefits related to U.S. exports. But Trump offered no specifics about the broader impact of his order, including what it means for tariffs and for Hong Kong\u2019s financial industry. Earlier, Pompeo had announced visa restrictions against unspecified Chinese officials and said the U.S. would cease selling defense equipment to Hong Kong, a largely symbolic act that will mostly affect the city\u2019s police and corrections forces. In deciding how far to go, Trump has to weigh consequences for the U.S. economy, including the U.S.-China trade deal that Trump had considered one of his biggest achievements and which could affect his odds of winning re-election.3. What\u2019s at stake for Hong Kong and China?ADADWhile Hong Kong remains a gateway from China to the rest of the world, it matters far less to the mainland\u2019s fortunes than it once did. In 2019, 12% of China\u2019s exports went to or through Hong Kong, down from 45% in 1992. China is also far less reliant on inflows of foreign capital and expertise, and made a lower priority of making the yuan an international currency -- although it has renewed the push as tensions with the U.S. have risen. Regardless, the city still matters. Hong Kong\u2019s open capital account and adherence to international standards of governance are unmatched by any mainland Chinese city and make it an important base for international banks and trading firms. A revocation of its special status would mark \u201cthe beginning of the death of Hong Kong as we know it,\u201d Steve Tsang, director of the University of London\u2019s SOAS China Institute, said last year.4. And their financial markets?If the U.S. treats Hong Kong no differently than any other Chinese city, would ratings firms and investors do the same? That\u2019s a question posed by Deutsche Bank, which noted that S&P Global Ratings has Hong Kong three notches above China while Moody\u2019s and Fitch have Hong Kong one notch higher. The risk is that China\u2019s own rating gets lowered in coming years and drags Hong Kong\u2019s down with it. At the same time, equity index providers may take a fresh look at Hong Kong, which is currently in the MSCI World Index with other developed markets. China is in the emerging market index, raising the question, should Hong Kong be treated the same as Shanghai and Shenzhen?ADAD5. What\u2019s at stake for the U.S.?It has its own reasons for not rocking the boat too much. Hong Kong, the only semi-democratic jurisdiction under Chinese rule, offers U.S. companies a relatively safe way to access the Chinese market and employs a U.S. dollar peg, linking it with the American financial system. According to the Congressional Research Service, the largest U.S. trade surplus in 2019 was with Hong Kong \u2014 $36 billion. Hong Kong counted 278 U.S. companies with regional headquarters in the city that year and another 457 with offices. Hong Kong\u2019s first justice minister after the handover to China in 1997, Elsie Leung, told the South China Morning Post in May that any damage would be mutual: \u201cWe are not just getting the benefits \u2013 it\u2019s a free-trade arrangement which is good for both sides.\u201d6. How has China responded?ADADThe Foreign Ministry has promised unspecified retaliation against what it terms foreign interference, insisting Hong Kong is purely an internal affair. China said last year it would sanction some U.S.-based activist groups including the National Endowment for Democracy, Human Rights Watch and Freedom House, and suspend port visits by U.S. Navy ships to Hong Kong. The official Xinhua News Agency has dismissed as \u201cgroundless\u201d accusations about the loss of freedom or human rights issues in Hong Kong. It also noted that the 2018 Human Freedom Index compiled by the Fraser Institute, a Vancouver-based think tank, ranked Hong Kong at No. 3, well ahead of the U.S. at No. 17.7. And Hong Kong?The city\u2019s leader, Chief Executive Carrie Lam, has said it\u2019s \u201ctotally unacceptable\u201d for foreign legislatures to interfere in Hong Kong\u2019s internal affairs, and that sanctions would only complicate the city\u2019s problems.

It is one of the bluntest expressions of U.S. hard power in years.Yet the very fact that such a dramatic step was even necessary indicates how the power balance is shifting in China\u2019s favor. China\u2019s long-term and methodical attempt to dominate shoals and islands in the region is a reflection of both U.S. domestic distractions and its loss of prestige throughout Asia.ADWhile the United States is half a world distant from Asia, China is Asia\u2019s geographical, demographic, economic and military organizing principle. Asians simply cannot escape the Chinese. For them to align with the United States in the face of China\u2019s immovable presence has always required faith in the word and commitment of the United States to this vast region. But for the first time since World War II, a U.S. president has shaken that faith to its core.ADDonald Trump began his presidency by abrogating the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the years-in-the-making trade, investment and political cornerstone of a U.S.-led liberal order in Asia. Trump tore up this historic framework in the face of China\u2019s own grand strategy for Eurasia: the Belt and Road Initiative. While China was promoting a vision, however imperfect and coercive, the United States deliberately has had nothing to offer.It gets worse.ADThe basis of Asian security since World War II has been the United States-Japan treaty alliance. By anchoring the United States to Asia\u2019s second-strongest nation, Washington elegantly contained Beijing, allowing states from Japan south to Australia to get rich off China\u2019s economic growth, while the United States provided for their security. No nation had to choose between the United States and China. And no nation had to fear Japanese militarism ever again.ADYet, since before he was inaugurated, Trump has questioned the very foundation of the treaty alliance: providing for Japan\u2019s defense. This has terrified the Japanese, and the region, to a degree unprecedented in the post-World War II era. The United States\u2019 standing in Japan and the region has been demonstrably weakened.Meanwhile, Japan has been mired in a vicious trade war with South Korea for a year now \u2014 a conflict that has its origins in contentious World War II history. Another administration might have dispatched an assistant secretary of state to Tokyo and Seoul to conduct vigorous shuttle diplomacy in order to quickly extinguish the issue and repair the alliance. But the Trump administration has done relatively little.ADThere is now a feeling of exposure and loneliness among the United States\u2019 Asian allies. For the first time since President Richard M. Nixon went to China in 1972, the United States\u2019 bilateral relationship with China is both hostile and unpredictable, even as Washington has provided its friends in the region with less reassurance than at any time since the Korean War 70 years ago.ADChina\u2019s pulverizing repression of the Turkic Muslim Uighurs in Xinjiang province, followed by its security crackdown in Hong Kong and its continued aggression in the South China Sea, suggests that Taiwan may be next in Beijing\u2019s sights \u2014 as a nation bordering the South China Sea and the only part of historic China yet to be forcibly brought to heel. Taiwan, like West Berlin during the Cold War, is an outpost of freedom in stark opposition to the authoritarian mainland. Its symbolism should not be underestimated. Were Taiwan\u2019s independence ever compromised, it would signal the end of the United States\u2019 preeminent influence not only in Asia but far beyond.Taiwan is not about to be invaded by China. Yet it is unclear how much it can rely on the United States in a crisis. Alliances depend on deterrence. Deterrence, in turn, rests on an unshakable moral commitment to a common strategy. Yet we are witnessing unprecedented Chinese aggression coupled with unprecedented doubts about U.S. intentions. Rather than lead an alliance, Trump has emerged as merely a transactor for whom nothing is sacred. It will take more than two aircraft carriers to repair this impression and the damage it has caused.ADWhat is now tethering the United States\u2019 Asian allies to Washington is less confidence in the United States than outright fear of China. But if this situation goes on, what may start to emerge is a creeping Finlandization, in which the United States\u2019 erstwhile Asian allies are careful not to interfere with Beijing\u2019s objectives, while they continue to pay lip service to Washington. Like the case with Soviet influence over Finland during the Cold War, their foreign policies will no longer be wholly independent. ADConsider Vietnam, which has both a land border with China and a bloody history with it. Vietnam\u2019s vulnerable geography makes it prone to greater Chinese influence were Trump to become even more unreliable. The case is similar with the Philippines, Malaysia and Singapore. We can never take these countries for granted.It is all about geography: China\u2019s very size and proximity make a sturdy and unquestioning U.S. regional order essential for the power balance in Asia.Read more:Robert D.

They\u2019re calling for a five-year transition to limit the disruption for customers.\u00a0Huawei officials, meanwhile, are warning that the U.K. might be abandoning its chance to be a leader in 5G, which is expected to be much faster and more efficient than current telecom networks and capable of carrying exponentially more data.\u00a0\u201cThis is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for the U.K.,\u201d Huawei Global Vice President Victor Zhang warned.\u00a0Some U.S. companies are also sounding alarms about the difficulty of transitioning away from Huawei.\u00a0A slew of industry groups, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the Aerospace Industries Association and the Computing Technology Industry Association, are pushing for a one-year delay on a Trump administration ban on government contractors using Huawei, as Inside Cybersecurity reports. The ban is expected to be finalized shortly.ADADThey say there\u2019s not enough time to implement the ban and contractors need to focus on weathering the coronavirus pandemic.\u00a0\u201cAn extension of the deadline would actually strengthen U.S. security by ensuring better planning and execution of the statutory prohibitions,\u201d David Berteau, chief executive of the Professional Services Council, a coalition of government contractors, told Defense News.\u00a0Those calls are unlikely to gain much traction from the White House or in Congress, where Republicans and Democrats are largely united in getting tough on China \u2014 and on Huawei, in particular.The fact that allies are turning against Huawei despite those costs is a feather in the cap for the Trump administration\u2019s foreign policy.\u00a0It comes after months during which allies questioned why the administration couldn't produce a \u201csmoking gun\u201d showing that Huawei posed a spying danger. They were also highly skeptical of President Trump for seeming to use U.S. efforts against Huawei as a bargaining chip in U.S.-China trade negotiations.\u00a0ADADThe turn is partly due to increasingly stringent U.S. restrictions.\u00a0The harshest move came in May, when the Commerce Department effectively hobbled Huawei\u2019s supply chain by banning foreign firms selling computer chips within the United States from also working with the Chinese firm.\u00a0The shift was helped along by global anger over China\u2019s lack of transparency during the early days of the coronavirus pandemic and its crackdown in Hong Kong.\u00a0Finally, U.S. officials changed their strategy from arguing Huawei itself was guilty of spying to arguing that the company simply couldn\u2019t refuse to aid spying by Beijing under China\u2019s communist system.\u00a0\u201cWe really pivoted that discussion over time,\u201d said Robert Strayer, deputy assistant secretary for cyber and international communications and information policy in the State Department. \u201cIf you fully understand the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s intent in the way the system works in China, there\u2019s not autonomy for those companies.\u201d\u00a0The U.S. argument has worked with many allies, but it won\u2019t put Huawei out of business.\u00a0The U.K.\u2019s decision effectively means Huawei will be cut off from 5G networks across the United States and all four of its closest intelligence-sharing partners \u2014 the U.K., Canada, Australia and New Zealand.ADADNumerous other nations have also banned Huawei from their networks, including\u00a0Poland, Estonia, the Czech Republic and Japan. India, which has not yet built any 5G system, nevertheless barred two state-run firms from using Chinese gear after security clashes along its border with China.But Huawei and another Chinese telecom, ZTE, control about 90 percent of the 5G market in China, which accounts for about half the global market. And they\u2019re pushing to control the 5G markets in Latin America and Africa when they develop.That has many analysts fearing a future in which the world is effectively bisected between regions that rely on Western technology and those in which Chinese technology is ascendant.The keysThe spyware firm NSO Group can continue to sell its tools internationally, an Israeli court ruled.The judge rejected a request by Amnesty International and other groups to revoke NSO's export license on the basis that it had facilitated human rights violations. The groups failed to provide adequate evidence for their claim that the company attempted to hack the phone of an Amnesty International activist, the judge said.ADADThe ruling was a blow to cybersecurity and privacy groups that accuse NSO of helping authoritarian governments spy on activists, journalists and political dissidents.\u00a0\u201cThe ruling of the court flies in the face of the mountains of evidence of NSO Group\u2019s spyware being used to target human rights defenders from Saudi Arabia to Mexico,\u201d Danna Ingleton, acting co-director of Amnesty Tech, said in a statement.NSO, meanwhile, applauded the decision. \u201cThe judgment is irrefutable evidence that the regulatory framework in which we operate in is of the highest international standard,\u201d it said in a statement.WhatsApp is also suing NSO for allegedly helping to hack at least 100 of its users across 20 countries.At least 65,000 mail-in ballots have been rejected in primaries held during the pandemic so far.The ballots arrived after election deadlines but often through no fault of the voter, according to an NPR analysis reported by Pam Fessler and Elena Moore. The rejected ballots make up a small percentage of total ballots in most states but they're enough to make a difference in a close election.\u00a0ADADIn some states the figure is higher. Virginia, for example, rejected nearly 6 percent of mail-in ballots. And even a small percentage of rejected ballots is likely to undermine people's faith that their vote will be counted.\u00a0Even more concerning, people voting by mail for the first time are more likely to have their ballots rejected, Charles Stewart, a political scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, told NPR. That could cause chaos, with an influx of voters switching to mail voting because of the coronavirus pandemic.\u00a0Democrats and advocacy groups have filed lawsuits trying to force several states to count all mail votes as long as they\u2019re postmarked before Election Day. Republicans argue that it would create too much confusion to continue to count votes after Election Day.Trump confirmed a U.S. cyberattack against a Russian troll farm ahead of the 2018 midterms.\u00a0The president made the confirmation during an\u00a0interview with Washington Post columnist\u00a0Marc Thiessen.\u00a0ADADThe Post first reported on the U.S. Cyber Command operation last year, but White House and military officials had not previously acknowledged it,\u00a0Ellen reports. The operation was a prime example of Trump administration efforts to\u00a0aggressively punch back against adversaries in cyberspace. The White House expanded Cybercom\u2019s authority to launch offensive attacks in 2018.The confirmation marked a rare acknowledgment by the president of Russian efforts to sow discord in U.S. elections. The intelligence community warns that Russia is likely to interfere again in the 2020 election.Cybercom also\u00a0carried out an attack against computer systems used by Iran\u2019s\u00a0Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps to target oil tankers in the Persian Gulf\u00a0last August.

Subscribe today.arrow-rightIn a speech, Vice President Pence hailed the effort, saying \u201cPresident Trump knows that a stable and orderly space environment is critical to the strength of our economy and the resilience of our national security systems.\u201dBut since then, the directive, known as Space Policy Directive-3, has gone nowhere, mired in a Washington bureaucratic battle over which agency would be best suited for the mission. The Trump administration argues that the Commerce Department is best placed to foster the growing commercial space industry \u2014 including satellite servicing, manufacturing, space tourism and more \u2014 while taking advantage of new technology to track items in orbit.ADADSome members of Congress think, however, that the responsibility should go to the Federal Aviation Administration instead, extending that agency\u2019s jurisdiction from the skies to space.The impasse has left the Pentagon with tracking space debris and satellites as well as warning governments and private companies around the world of potential collisions, as it has done for years. It\u2019s a job it doesn\u2019t want \u2014 and that the White House doesn\u2019t want it to have.It\u2019s not clear when, or if, the logjam will break.A spokesman for the National Space Council said fully funding the Office of Space Commerce \u201cremains a top priority\u201d to \u201caddress the emerging growth of large constellations in low Earth orbit and lay the foundation for management of future space traffic.\u201dADOthers are less optimistic that such an office will be established.AD\u201cThe odds of getting legislation introduced this year, in an election year, on a topic of low political priority, were slim to begin with,\u201d said Brian Weeden, the director of program planning at the Secure World Foundation, a think tank. \u201cAnd then we had a pandemic.\u201dAs the debate drags on, the number of satellites being launched to orbit continues to grow dramatically, raising the possibility of more collisions and more debris that in turn would threaten other satellites that are used for missile warnings, GPS, television, communications and more.At least four companies are moving ahead with plans to put up constellations of thousands of satellites that would beam the Internet to the estimated 4 billion people without access to broadband. Over the next 10 years, more than 50,000 satellites could be launched into orbit, up from the few thousand currently in operation today, according to Analytical Graphics Inc., or AGI, a company based outside Philadelphia that builds software to track spacecraft and debris in space. That\u2019s in addition to the junk floating around there. The Pentagon tracks about 22,000 pieces of debris larger than about four inches, but scientists say there are nearly 1 million larger than half an inch.ADADAGI estimates that over the next 10 years, there could be as many as 404 collisions and 17 million close calls in the most congested orbits. Tracking all those objects and issuing warnings is too much for the Pentagon to handle \u2014 and outside its primary task of defending the nation. A civilian agency could be more adept in keeping up with the demand and better at communicating with private companies as well as foreign governments, some experts believe, though the Pentagon would continue to monitor space activity.\u201cIt\u2019s easier for the Department of Commerce to leverage commercial or other modern technology than it is for the Pentagon,\u201d Weeden said. He called the Pentagon\u2019s current tracking system \u201cantiquated.\u201d\u201cIt was a great system 30 years ago, and it did the job it was designed to do,\u201d Paul Graziani, AGI\u2019s CEO, said in an interview. \u201cHowever, the problem has moved on over the decades to be a much more difficult problem than the system was designed to handle.\u201dADADSpaceX has won approval from the Federal Communications Commission to put 12,000 small satellites into orbit as part of its Starlink Internet constellation. Already it has launched 540, making it one of the largest satellite operators in the world, officials said, with more satellites in space than even China.Companies currently need to demonstrate that their individual satellites won\u2019t cause collisions to win FCC approval, Weeden said, but some experts want additional regulations that would extend to the constellations as a whole.Amazon, meanwhile, also has plans to deploy a large constellation as part of a program it calls Kuiper. The FCC on Thursday approved Amazon\u2019s plan to put up 3,236 satellites, and the company said it would invest $10 billion in the effort. (Amazon founder and chief executive Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)ADAD\u201cA project of this scale requires significant effort and resources, and, due to the nature of LEO constellations, it is not the kind of initiative that can start small,\u201d Amazon said in a statement. \"You have to commit.\u201dAnother company, OneWeb, intends to launch hundreds of satellites for broadband service, despite a bankruptcy filing that led to its acquisition by the British government and an Indian company.With all that activity, analysts say the U.S. government needs to move fast if it is going to be able to keep up and establish policies for the rest of the world to follow.\u201cA collision between two satellites could have a catastrophic impact on the space environment for centuries to come,\u201d FCC chairman Ajit Pai said recently.ADIn April, the FCC, which over the past year has approved some 13,000 new satellites for launch, updated its rules governing orbital debris for the first time since 2004. Satellite applicants must now provide numerical values for the risk of collision and demonstrate how their satellites will be disposed of at the end of their missions, as well as make upgrades to design that would help avoid collisions.ADWhile the rule updates are a good step forward, \u201cthere is still more we need to do,\u201d FCC Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel said in April. The commission considered tightening a rule that allows a satellite to stay in orbit for up to 25 years after its mission ends, a time frame that many think is far too long. But ultimately, the commission did not make any changes.\u201cThis rule simply does not make sense in today\u2019s orbital environment,\u201d Rosenworcel said.ADDebris begets more debris, and collisions, officials say, are inevitable and can inflict serious damage. In orbit, objects travel at immense speed \u2014 the International Space Station, for example, whizzes around Earth at 17,500 mph. So even something the size of a peanut can do tremendous harm.Though outfitted with material intended to protect against debris strikes, the space station from time to time has had to maneuver to avoid getting hit. There even have been a few close calls in which ground controllers didn\u2019t have time to move the station out of the way. In those cases, the astronauts had to evacuate the station and seek refuge in a docked spacecraft in case a collision caused the station to depressurize.ADIn one of the most congested areas, about 430 to 560 miles high, \u201cthere is enough human-generated orbital debris \u2026 to create more debris even if no new satellites were launched,\u201d Weeden told a congressional committee this year.ADCatastrophic collisions could occur between every five to seven years, he said.The first-ever satellite crash happened in 2009, when a dead Russian satellite collided with a communications satellite operated by Iridium, creating almost 2,000 pieces of debris at least four inches in diameter and thousands more smaller pieces. Much of the debris will remain in orbit for years to come, each a threat to other spacecraft.This year, two dead satellites nearly collided. If they had, it would have created yet another field of debris that could have threatened other satellites. And with more satellites being launched, the chance of more close calls and collisions will only rise.AD\u201cWe\u2019re going to see an even steeper exponential growth in the number of close calls,\u201d said Todd Harrison, an aerospace analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \u201cWe cannot afford to have more collisions because it produces long-lasting debris that ultimately could limit our ability to use this part of space. It could have far-reaching economic consequences as well as strategic consequences if we screw up that area of space we use for security.\u201dOne of the reasons the Trump administration moved so aggressively to form the Space Force, the newest branch of the military, was to defend U.S. assets in space, which are used for reconnaissance, guiding precision munitions and communications. But the Space Force doesn\u2019t want to be in the business of warning companies and governments every time one of their satellites comes uncomfortably close to another.\u201cThey don\u2019t want to be in the business of doing warnings for everyone on the world,\u201d Harrison said. \u201cThat\u2019s not a military function.\u201dTo transfer that authority to the Commerce Department, as the Trump administration called for two years ago, Congress would have to allocate funds and give the agency the authorization to do so.SpaceX, however, is moving quickly and says it could begin offering Internet service from its Starlink constellation in the United States in Canada this year, while \u201crapidly expanding to near global coverage of the populated world by 2021.\"In a discussion with reporters late last year, Gwynne Shotwell, SpaceX\u2019s president and chief operating officer, said that Starlink will be able to serve remote areas that fiber hasn\u2019t reached.\u201cDoes anyone like their Internet?\u201d she said. \u201cAnyone? Anyone? Nope. Anybody paying less than like 80 bucks a month for crappy \u2026 service? No. Okay, there we go. That\u2019s why we\u2019re going to be successful.\u201dThe company has said that it has taken steps to ensure its new satellites won\u2019t exacerbate the debris problem. The satellites are outfitted with thrusters and can \u201cautonomously perform maneuvers to avoid collisions with space debris and other spacecraft,\u201d the company said. \u201cThis capability reduces human error, allowing for a more reliable approach to collision avoidance.\u201dAt the end of their lives, the satellites would take themselves out of orbit and burn up in the atmosphere. And if those propulsion systems don\u2019t work, they\u2019ll automatically fall out of orbit within one to five years, the company said, significantly faster than the 25 years allowed now.", "comment": "117 Comments", "topic": "Space"}, {"cover": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/PSSXDTGMRQI6VGNQQQTOE3JAHM.jpghttps://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/PSSXDTGMRQI6VGNQQQTOE3JAHM.jpg", "title": "How Malaysia\u2019s 1MDB Scandal Shook the Financial World", "date": "Jul 24, 2020", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/energy/how-malaysias-1mdb-scandal-shook-the-financial-world/2020/07/22/7da95a20-cc8c-11ea-99b0-8426e26d203b_story.html", "keyword": "China and Security", "website": "the Washington Post", "author": "", "content": "Read More:\u00a0Ex-Malaysia PM Najib Razak Faces Court for Biggest 1MDB Corruption TrialMalaysia\u2019s state-owned investment fund, 1MDB, was supposed to promote development. Instead, it has spurred investigations around the world into deal-making, election spending and political patronage under former Prime Minister Najib Razak. The figures are mind-boggling: Of the $8 billion that 1MDB raised via bond sales, the U.S. alleges more than half was siphoned off. Angry voters ousted Najib in a 2018 election that ended his party\u2019s 61 years of rule, and a series of trials is underway. U.S. prosecutors have implicated at least three senior bankers from Goldman Sachs Group Inc., one of whom admited to bribery, and Malaysia has filed charges against the bank and some current and former employees.Support our journalism. Subscribe today.arrow-right1. What is 1MDB?ADADIt\u2019s a government investment company -- full name, 1Malaysia Development Bhd -- that took shape in 2009 under Najib, who led its advisory board. Its early initiatives included buying privately owned power plants and planning a new financial district in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia\u2019s capital. The fund proved better at borrowing -- it accumulated $12 billion in debt -- than at luring large-scale foreign investment.2. What\u2019s the issue?Much of the money raised was allegedly embezzled. The U.S. Justice Department says more than $4.5 billion flowed from the fund through fraudulent shell companies to corrupt officials and their associates. According to the U.S. indictment, a small coterie of Malaysians, led by businessman Low Taek Jho (known as Jho Low), diverted money from 1MDB into personal accounts disguised to look like legitimate businesses, and kicked back some of those funds to officials. There were questions about a $681 million payment that landed in Najib\u2019s personal bank account. Malaysia\u2019s then-attorney general cleared Najib of wrongdoing in 2016. But after losing office, Najib was charged with 42 counts of corruption, breach of trust and money laundering. He has pleaded not guilty and said most of the $681 million was returned. A verdict was expected July 28, while other proceedings are ongoing. Jho Low, a fugitive, has also denied any wrongdoing.ADAD3. Where\u2019s the money?Scattered. Former Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad has said Malaysia is seeking to recoup $7 billion. His then-finance minister said the country would consider dropping charges against Goldman in return for $7.5 billion in \u201creparations and compensations.\u201d (Goldman made $593 million working on three bond sales that raised $6.5 billion for 1MDB in 2012 and 2013 -- far more than what banks typically make from such deals.) Privately, Malaysian negotiators were considering settling for around $2 billion to $3 billion, with the current finance minister holding talks with Goldman representatives. Meanwhile, the bank could end up paying less than $2 billion to resolve U.S. probes. As for others:\u2022 The U.S. Justice Department struck a deal in October with Jho Low to recoup almost $700 million worth of assets, including a Beverly Hills hotel and real estate in New York and London. That\u2019s in addition to $260 million of assets, including a $126 million super yacht, seized earlier on Malaysia\u2019s behalf.ADAD\u2022 The U.S. reached a $60 million settlement with the producers of \u201cThe Wolf of Wall Street,\u201d a 2013 movie allegedly funded with siphoned money. The production company was co-founded by Riza Aziz, Najib\u2019s stepson and a friend of Jho Low.\u2022 Malaysia is moving to seize $340 million in PetroSaudi International\u2019s accounts in London.\u2022 Singapore is returning S$35 million ($25 million) forfeited by former Goldman banker Roger Ng.4. Who\u2019s investigating?The U.S. Justice Department has been at the forefront of 1MDB investigations, focusing on bribery, theft and money laundering. According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, some potential witnesses were scared to talk because they feared retaliation. Several other countries also conducted probes. Singapore and Switzerland have fined some banks for lapses in anti-money laundering controls. Malaysia also has said it is looking into allegations that China offered to help fend off probes into 1MDB in the U.S. and elsewhere in exchange for stakes in infrastructure projects in Malaysia. A former Najib aide testified that the ex-premier offered projects to China in return for help resolving 1MDB\u2019s debt.ADAD5. Who else is charged?\u2022 Jho Low, a bon vivant who said he did consulting work for 1MDB, is portrayed by U.S. prosecutors as the central figure who set up shell companies to collect proceeds from the fund and arranged withdrawals for payoffs and for his own lavish spending. He has been charged in absentia in Malaysia and the U.S. with money laundering and other offenses. Malaysian police have bemoaned the lack of help from other jurisdictions in finding him, after saying they had located him and were in talks with a party they suspect of protecting him. Jho Low\u2019s settlement with the U.S. didn\u2019t include an admission of guilt or release him from criminal charges.\u2022 Goldman\u2019s former Southeast Asia Chairman Tim Leissner pleaded guilty to U.S. charges including conspiracy to launder money and admited to bribing officials in Malaysia and the United Arab Emirates to get bond deals for Goldman. He agreed to forfeit $43.7 million and was scheduled to be sentenced on Jan. 22, 2021.ADAD\u2022 Ng was extradited from Malaysia to the U.S. to face similar charges. His trial start date was postponed until January 2021 by the coronavirus outbreak. (The U.S. Federal Reserve has banned both men from the financial industry.)\u2022 Malaysia filed criminal charges against three Goldman units, accusing the bank of misrepresenting to investors that the proceeds of the three 1MDB bond sales would be used for legitimate purposes, when the bank knew the funds would be misappropriated. It\u2019s seeking more than $3.3 billion. Goldman has blamed rogue employees for any wrongdoing, and said it would vigorously defend itself.\u2022 Malaysia also filed criminal charges against 17 current and former Goldman employees who served as directors of the three units, including the current president of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.ADAD\u2022 Malaysia leveled charges of securities law violations against Leissner, Ng, Jho Low and 1MDB\u2019s former general counsel, Jasmine Loo Ai Swan.\u2022 PetroSaudi International directors Tarek Obaid and Patrick Mahony were charged by Malaysia in absentia in 2020 for allegedly receiving $300 million from 1MDB through unlawful activity. In 2018, Swiss federal prosecutors opened proceedings to investigate two officials of the Saudi oil producer, without confirming their identities.\u2022 Ex-1MDB President Arul Kanda was charged along with Najib for allegedly tampering with a state audit report into the fund. Both men have denied wrongdoing.\u2022 Rosmah Mansor, Najib\u2019s wife, was charged with money laundering and tax evasion. Luxury items and cash seized from properties linked to the former first couple were valued at about 1.1 billion ringgit ($259 million). According to U.S. prosecutors, Jho Low in 2013 allegedly funneled $27.3 million that was looted from 1MDB to a New York jeweler who designed a pink diamond necklace for her.ADAD6. What\u2019s still brewing?The U.S. Justice Department\u2019s investigation of Goldman Sachs, and whether it will force the bank to take a guilty plea, is one of the biggest issues remaining. Prosecutors assert that beyond Leissner, some employees at Goldman knew about a bribery scheme but worked to hide it from the firm\u2019s compliance and legal departments. Singapore was said to have expanded a criminal probe to include Goldman; two Abu Dhabi funds have filed a civil suit against Goldman in New York seeking damages for alleged fraud in connection with embezzlement at 1MDB; and a Justice Department employee has pleaded guilty to funneling money into the U.S. to pay for a lobbying effort to influence the 1MDB probe, with the filing identifying the fund\u2019s source as Jho Low. In another twist, the U.S. was said to be investigating Deutsche Bank AG over a former Goldman executive who joined the German bank.7. Exactly how much money is involved?ADADIn all, 1MDB raised more than $8 billion in bond sales and accumulated billions more in debt through loans and interest payments. Swiss investigators say about $7 billion of 1MDB funds passed into the global financial system from 2009 to 2015. They\u2019re still assessing how much was misappropriated; the U.S. estimates more than half. Some 1MDB projects are going ahead under the new government, including the plan for a new financial district and a $34 billion property and transport hub. As for 1MDB, it has been reduced to a shell after the finance ministry took over its assets and debt.8. Why does it matter?Authorities in Asia, the U.S. and Europe have been working to coordinate their investigations into the money trail from 1MDB, as well as legal approaches toward Goldman and asset recovery. Their findings could potentially identify, and help close, loopholes in the global financial system that open the way for corruption.9. Who else is involved?\u2022 The Fed banned ex-Goldman banker Andrea Vella from the financial industry for life, saying the former co-head of investment banking in Asia engaged in \u201cunsafe and unsound practices\u201d by failing to ensure all of Goldman\u2019s internal committees were aware that the 1MDB bond deals involved Jho Low.\u2022 Switzerland\u2019s Office of the Attorney-General continues to investigate six people on suspicion of criminal mismanagement, bribery and money laundering related to the case. The top Swiss prosecutors have also opened criminal proceedings against two Swiss banks, Falcon Private Bank Ltd. and BSI SA, for \u201corganizational deficiencies that may have permitted the commission of offenses currently being investigated.\u201d\u2022 Zurich-based Falcon, linked to $3.8 billion of 1MDB fund flows, was ordered to cease operations in Singapore, and Switzerland has threatened to withdraw its license if there were any further breaches of money-laundering regulations.\u2022 Switzerland\u2019s financial regulator said it would review JPMorgan Chase & Co.\u2019s anti-money laundering controls after finding the bank seriously breached regulations in its dealings with 1MDB.\u2022 BSI lost its license to do business in Singapore for breaches of money laundering rules.\u2022 Malaysia central bank governor Muhammad Ibrahim resigned in 2018 amid questions over the role the monetary authority played in a land-purchase deal linked to 1MDB.

Subscribe today.arrow-rightFew Americans have the depth and breadth of hands-on national security experience that Gates has. Serving under eight presidents of both parties over four decades, he rose quickly to become director of the CIA and secretary of defense under Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama.Gates\u2019s chief premise here is that the use of military force should be a last resort \u2014 not the first. To make it more explicit, he implores future presidents and commanders, when considering the use of force, to ask these questions: Is the U.S. military the right or optimal solution to a problem? Are there nonmilitary means that can achieve partial success (e.g., the Iran nuclear agreement)? Does the use of the military entail collateral costs, and how well can the inevitable unintended consequences be anticipated? Does the situation justify putting the lives of young Americans at risk? The answers to these questions, Gates writes, \u201cmight have led to different decisions in Somalia, Haiti, the Balkans and Libya and in both Iraq and Afghanistan after the initial military objectives had been achieved.\u201dGates rightly focuses on the uses and misuses of American power in the seemingly endless wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, where, he argues, the United States failed to adhere to its originally stated military missions, allowing them to be morphed into nation building, a task for which, he emphasizes, the armed forces are neither trained nor suited. \u201cThere was a terrible mismatch between our ambitions to change Afghanistan and our ability to do so,\u201d Gates says, \u201cand in our ambition we lost sight of the very specific and limited reason we went [there] .\u2009.\u2009. after the attacks of September 11, 2001: to destroy those who attacked us, al-Qaeda, and to oust the Taliban. We assumed \u2014 because of our good intentions and our unparalleled power \u2014 that our experience in Afghanistan would turn out differently and better than that of all the foreign invaders over the centuries who preceded us.\u201dADADThe story in Iraq, in Gates\u2019s telling, is much the same: Bush chose to build a \u201cbetter, democratic Iraq\u201d after the initial fighting was over and Saddam Hussein was removed (largely as a cover, Gates concedes, for the failure to discover weapons of mass destruction), but without recognizing the difficulty of the task. The White House relied almost entirely on U.S. military forces to carry it out and then, seeing the mistake, compounded it by \u201cthe failure to recognize and then remedy the weaknesses of our nonmilitary instruments of power that were so essential to even attempting such an effort.\u201dIt is these nonmilitary powers that constitute the essence of Gates\u2019s work. He gives the reader a brief tutorial on exactly what the term includes: diplomacy, economic leverage, intelligence, alliances, cyber, development assistance, communications, science and technology, culture, ideology, religion, nationalism, the private sector, and \u201cwise and courageous leadership.\u201d It\u2019s a cornucopia of alternative means that Gates successfully avoids calling soft power; he spends the balance of the book unpacking them in specific case studies where they sometimes worked and more frequently weren\u2019t deployed. He argues persuasively that they were our most effective weapons during the Cold War, when military confrontation could have meant nuclear war and when the Soviet Union\u2019s values contrasted sharply with our own, making these tools more effective in a binary contest.Gates laments that the United States has allowed most of them to atrophy in a more complex post-Cold War world, where ironically our chief adversaries \u2014 Russia, China, Iran, North Korea \u2014 have successfully developed and refined them for use against us. He emphasizes: \u201cPerhaps the most important nonmilitary instrument of power is a long-range strategy for waging this competition. The Chinese have one. The United States does not.\u201dADADGates enjoys a reputation for fair-mindedness, which is apparent through most of the book; his treatment of Obama and his team, however, appears to be an exception. He cites Obama, along with President Trump, as \u201ctwo successive presidents who have signaled an American withdrawal from global leadership.\u201d This linking of Obama, who inherited two miserable wars and who struggled \u2014 sometimes, albeit tentatively \u2014 to avoid being dragged into others, with Trump, whose erratically impulsive decisions, alienation of allies and inexplicable deference to Vladimir Putin have caused U.S. credibility to evaporate, is just plain wrong. Putting Obama and Trump in the same (foreign policy) boat is gratuitous and unfair.Gates skims over Obama\u2019s success in securing a nuclear-arms deal with Iran, which Gates calls \u201ctime-limited [and] flawed.\u201d It nonetheless allowed the world to breathe easier, until Trump tanked it. Ironically, Obama used the precise formula that Gates suggests by resisting those who urged airstrikes on Iran\u2019s nuclear sites and instead employing alternative means \u2014 diplomacy, economic leverage, alliances and communications \u2014 in a strategic and successful venture.In a serious omission, Gates ignores climate change in any discussion of strategic priorities. It\u2019s worth noting that Obama played an indispensable role in building a global consensus of 195 signatories to the 2016 Paris climate agreement, perhaps the best indicator of worldwide support for addressing the issue that will determine the future of our planet and that belongs high on any list of national security priorities \u2014 but, sadly, not here.ADADNonetheless, Gates\u2019s policy and strategic advice to future decision-makers more than outweighs its blemishes and omissions. He skillfully blends the knowledge and discipline of a scholar with the hard-earned experience of a practitioner to produce a well-organized and superbly written book to lead America forward into a very different and challenging new world, and it is here that Gates\u2019s admonitions are most compelling. He summarizes it this way:\u201cWe must protect our interests. We must not be the world\u2019s policeman, and we must be very cautious about deploying our military forces to resolve others\u2019 internal problems. But we must also use every nonmilitary instrument of power we possess to promote freedom and encourage reform, with friends as well as rivals, because these objectives serve our national interest.\u201d Gates reminds us frequently that any viable U.S. foreign policy must win strong support from the American people; this statement \u2014 and the book itself \u2014 provides an excellent starting point.Gates and I both served in senior positions in the Carter White House, although I don\u2019t recall that we ever met. I wish we had, because I\u2019m sure I would have learned a lot; I certainly did here.Exercise of PowerAmerican Failures, Successes, and a New Path Forward in the Post-Cold War WorldBy Robert M.

For example, he pretended not to have been a participant in Trump\u2019s infamous phone call with Ukraine\u2019s president, and he defamed NPR reporter Mary Louise Kelly after she asked him a question he didn\u2019t like.ADADJuly 10: \u201cWe welcome Germany\u2019s [European Union] and UN Security Council presidencies and look forward to working closely with Germany to address global challenges at a critical time for the West.\u201d Trump is an avowed enemy of globalism who regularly trashes our allies, including Germany. He announced his intention to withdraw one-third of the U.S. troops stationed in Germany in a fit of pique with Chancellor Angela Merkel.June 26: \u201cThis is all about whether Iran is honoring its own legally binding safeguards obligations. If Iran fails to cooperate with its [International Atomic Energy Agency] obligations, the international community must be prepared to take further action.\u201d You would never know Trump was the one who withdrew from the nuclear deal, not Iran. This is only one of many international obligations \u2014 including the Paris Climate Agreement, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the Open Skies treaty, the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty and the World Health Organization \u2014 that Trump has abandoned.June 26: \u201cOn the International Day in Support of Victims of Torture, we honor and support victims and survivors of torture around the world. The U.S. is committed to using all available tools to promote accountability for those who engage in these abhorrent practices.\u201d Trump, who has often expressed his support for torture, is sanctioning the International Criminal Court, which prosecutes torturers, and has tried to closed America\u2019s doors to asylum seekers, including victims of torture. Moreover, the president promotes human rights abuses at home by sending security forces to attack unarmed demonstrators, threatening to shoot looters, pardoning war criminals, and encouraging cops to rough up suspects.ADADJune 25: \u201cThe [U.S.-Republic of Korea] alliance was formed in the crucible of war, and our bond remains ironclad in the defense of peace and security.\u201d Former national security adviser John Bolton revealed in his book \u201cThe Room Where It Happened: A White House Memoir\u201d that Trump does not understand why the United States fought the Korean War or has stationed troops in South Korea ever since. Trump has now caused a fissure with South Korea by stopping U.S.-South Korea military exercises without consulting Seoul and by demanding that South Korea pay $5 billion a year for the cost of stationing U.S. troops there \u2014 which would allow Washington to turn a profit.June 23: \u201cWhether it\u2019s freedom for the people of Hong Kong, human rights for the Royingya, all across the world, @realDonaldTrump has understood that it\u2019s important to be a true beacon for freedom and liberty and human rights around the globe.\u201d According to Bolton, Trump told Chinese leader Xi Jinping that he approved of China\u2019s prison camps for the Uighurs. That\u2019s in character for a president who supported the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre (\u201cThat shows you the power of strength\u201d).June 21: \u201cWe . . . believe the Chinese people deserve the truth, not propaganda.\u201d Trump\u2019s appointee to run the U.S. Agency for Global Media is purging professional journalists in an apparent bid to turn hallowed organizations such as Voice of America and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty into pro-Trump propaganda organs.ADADJune 14: \u201cMy best wishes to all soldiers and Army veterans at home and abroad on the occasion of the @USArmy\u2019s 245th Birthday! May we continue to live the values of loyalty, duty, respect, selfless service, honor, integrity, and personal courage.\u201d Is there anyone whose behavior is more at odds with these values than the commander in chief? Pompeo hasn\u2019t exemplified those values, either. He has placed loyalty to Trump above loyalty to the country \u2014 hence his unwillingness to protect Marie Yovanovitch, then the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, from the president\u2019s political goon squad.And that\u2019s only one month\u2019s worth of tweets. You can find more hypocrisy and howlers the longer you look.Most of the sentiments Pompeo expresses would be anodyne coming from any other administration but are risible from this one. Does he know who he works for? He acts as though someone else is president \u2014 Barack Obama perhaps? That makes U.S. diplomacy nearly worthless, because the whole world can see the Grand Canyon-size gap between Pompeo\u2019s rhetoric and Trump\u2019s actions and beliefs.

But there's so far little sign from Washington on whether they'll get the extra money they're seeking to help fund this.\u00a0ADThe White House and Senate Republicans failed to reach an agreement on a coronavirus relief package on Thursday, with the expiration of enhanced unemployment benefits looming just days away. The payroll tax cut that Trump had previously demanded was finally jettisoned but disagreements over the package's size and scope and its other provisions frustrated GOP efforts to move forward.\u00a0ADSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell outlined the broad terms of the bill \u2014 saying it would include another round of stimulus checks, aid for schools, money for coronavirus testing, changes to unemployment assistance rules, additional money for small businesses, and liability reform \u2014 but made no mention of additional funding for elections that Democrats, experts, state and local officials insist is necessary.\u00a0\u201cRepublicans had hoped to present a unified GOP plan July 22, but factions within the GOP couldn\u2019t reach an agreement and now they are hoping to have a united offer to Democrats on Monday. Late Thursday, they were still fighting over whether to include a demand by Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) related to manufacturing and China,\u201d our colleagues Erica Werner, Seung Min Kim and Jeff Stein report.\u00a0While House Democrats included $3.6 billion for elections as part of the $3 trillion coronavirus stimulus package they passed in May, Senate staffers told Power Up that many Republicans are disinclined to grant additional money for elections:\u00a0AD\u201cNo such thing as free money, as they say,\u201d a Republican Senate staffer told us. \u201cThe second the federal government starts giving money to states for 'security' then the next thing you know they\u2019ll condition that money on states doing what they want, be in universal mail in or whatever.\u201d\u00a0\u201cI think the biggest fights will be around state/local funding, [unemployment insurance] benefits, schools, and testing,\u201d a Senate Democratic staffer said. \u201cI know Dems obviously want additional money in [election] security and it was included in [the House Democratic bill] but not sure it will end up in there.\u201dExtra money, however, could go a long way in helping election officials manage an expansion of mail-in voting and other last-minute changes due to the pandemic.\u00a0As of now, nearly 180 million Americans who are eligible to vote would be able to cast a ballot by mail in the fall \u2014 or 76 percent of Americans, according to an analysis by our colleagues Kate Rabinowitz\u00a0and Brittany Renee Mayes.\u00a0But the effort carries a hefty price tag. \u201cEven in states that haven\u2019t made absentee voting easier, the number of ballot requests is still expected to spike. To meet this challenge, local election officials will have to overcome numerous hurdles with little time and money to spare,\u201d our colleagues write. \u201cThey must acquire large volumes of specialized envelopes and paper. Additional staff, and in some cases machines, are necessary to open, sort and tabulate postal ballots and verify signatures. This staff needs to be trained, and voters need to be educated on the process.\u201d\u00a0ADAD\u201cThese unexpected expenditures come as the coronavirus pandemic has pummeled local budgets and hit a corner of government \u2014 election administration \u2014 that\u2019s been underfunded for decades,\u201d per Kate and Brittany.\u00a0\u201cThey operate without the staff they need in the normal or they don\u2019t have enough equipment in the normal,\u201d Amber McReynolds, chief executive of Vote at Home, a nonpartisan nonprofit advocating for and advising on how to conduct elections by mail, told them. \u201cNone of this is a new problem, but it\u2019s exacerbated in a pandemic.\u201dThere's also an expected surge in overall expenses due to the pandemic, including for protective equipment (and potentially hazard pay) for poll workers, along with cleaning products and hand sanitizer for those who choose to vote in person.The Brennan Center for Justice at New York University estimated the total cost of these upgrades\u00a0would be $4 billion \u2013 which aligns with the latest Democratic proposal when added with the $400 million lawmakers from both parties passed during an earlier coronavirus relief bill in March.\u00a0But Republicans aren't united: Senate Rules and Administration Committee Chairman Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) acknowledged the circumstances might require additional election assistance. \u201cState and local election officials face a unique set of challenges with the covid-19 pandemic,\u201d Blunt said during a hearing on Tuesday. \u201cWe need to be sure they have the resources and, importantly, the flexibility to address those challenges in ways that best fit their needs.\"\u00a0Even if enough lawmakers coalesce around the idea of more election money, the next huge battle would be over mandates. House Democrats' bill \u201ccomes as close to a federal takeover of elections as has yet been proposed,\u201d coupling the influx of election money with new mandates for state and local election officials that will last long after the pandemic ends, our colleague Joe Marks notes.\u00a0\u201cIt mandates that states offer voting-by-mail options for all voters without excuses for all future elections starting in November. It also mandates 15 days of early voting across the country. And it requires that states draw up detailed plans to hold elections during future emergencies that the federal government can challenge in court if they don\u2019t sufficiently protect voters and poll workers.\u201d\u00a0\u201cIt even digs into the nitty-gritty of how states must run elections during the pandemic and other emergencies, including mandating they mail ballots directly to every registered voter.\u201dHouse Republicans tore into the provisions that they said override state constitutions, disenfranchise voters and will lead to increased voter fraud \u2014 and mandates are almost certain to get a similarly cool reception in the GOP-controlled Senate. The previous $400 million had no strings attached.\u00a0And President Trump has repeatedly and falsely attacked voting by mail, which could complicate negotiations in the Senate further. It's a strategy that worries some Republicans it might end up undermining their own party's candidates.\u00a0ADADFrom GOP pollster Glen Bolger:\u00a0 \n  \n  \n  You are reading the Power Up newsletter. \n  Not a regular subscriber? \n   \n   \n    \n   \n   \n  \n \nThe PeopleU.S. TOPS 4 MILLION CORONAVIRUS CASES: \u201cThe rapid spread of the virus this summer is striking, taking just 15 days to go from 3 million confirmed cases to 4 million. By comparison, the increase from 1 million cases to 2 million spanned 45 days from April 28 to June 11, and the leap to 3 million then took 27 days,\u201d Anne Gearan, Marisa Iati and Jacqueline Dupree report of the grim milestone.The CampaignTRUMP CANCELS JACKSONVILLE PORTION OF GOP CONVENTION: \u201cTrump abruptly canceled the Republican National Convention celebrations scheduled for next month in Jacksonville, Fla., making the latest in a series of head-snapping reversals in the face of a nationwide pandemic that continues to spread out of control,\u201d Michael Scherer, Josh Dawsey and Colby Itkowitz report.ADThe president had been searching for a place to host a loud boisterous crowd: \u201cThe president\u2019s ambition, however, ran headlong into a massive spike in coronavirus cases in Florida, growing local opposition and enormous logistical hurdles. At one point, convention planners announced they would administer daily coronavirus tests to thousands of delegates, donors and members of the media to help reduce the viral risk. That plan was later scrapped to move large portions of the celebrations to an outdoor venue.\u201dBehind the reversal: \u201cRepublican planners had already concluded that a packed, indoor arena would not be possible over several consecutive nights, given the high caseload in northern Florida,\u201d our colleagues write. \u201cSome White House and campaign officials were fearful of the negative press if delegates and others were infected with the virus at the convention \u2026\"ADThe National Guard may have been needed: \u201cThey also came to the conclusion that they would probably have to use the National Guard to protect the convention from protests and allow for distancing in the crowd. The president, advisers said, was less than enthusiastic about an arena or stadium that appeared less than full.\u201dOutside the Beltway\u2018OPERATION LEGEND\u2019 VIEWED AS POLITICAL CRACKDOWN: \u201cFederal agents began descending in earnest on Kansas City, Mo., this week as part of an operation that will have them working with local detectives to interview suspects and witnesses and sift through evidence in an effort to quell violent crime, U.S. officials said,\u201d Matt Zapotosky and Annie Gowen report. \u201cThe operation, in any other administration, might have been largely seen as inoffensive for a city that has experienced a massive spike in homicides from the prior year. But the timing \u2014 just after federal officers in military garb violently cracked down on racial justice demonstrators in Portland, Ore., and [Trump] threatened to dispatch U.S. law enforcement to other cities \u2014 could hardly be worse.\u201d\u00a0ADLocals are suspicious: \u201cSome officials said they were not consulted and do not know the precise plans. After the Trump administration announced Wednesday it would increase the federal presence in Chicago and Albuquerque, local officials there greeted the news icily,\u201d our colleagues write. Over 200 agents from the FBI, Drug Enforcement Administration, U.S. Marshals Service and other federal agencies are being sent to Missouri.Agents' conduct in Portland and in D.C. is now being investigated: \u201cTwo federal inspectors general announced they will investigate how Justice Department and Homeland Security agents used force, detained people and conducted themselves at high-profile clashes,\u201d Devlin Barrett reports.ADThe IG inquiries add to a growing list of inquiries into events in those cities: \u201cThe Democratic leaders of three congressional panels \u2014 Reps. Jerrold Nadler (N.Y.) of the Judiciary Committee, Carolyn B. Maloney (N.Y) of the Oversight and Reform Committee and Bennie Thompson (Miss.) of the Homeland Security Committee \u2014 said in a joint statement that the investigations are \u2018critically important\u2019 because the Trump administration has pledged to send federal agents to more cities in the coming days.\u201dIt is important to remember that most IG investigations take time and sometimes don't result in a public report for more than a year.On The HillLEWIS TO LIE IN STATE: \u201cThe late representative John Lewis will lie in state at the U.S. Capitol next week as congressional leaders take extraordinary steps amid the pandemic to honor the civil rights leader and allow the general public to pay their respects,\u201d Colby Itkowitz reports.While the Capitol remains closed to the public, people will be able to pay their respects: \u201cOnly a smaller, invitation-only group will be allowed inside the building on Monday afternoon for a ceremony under the Capitol Rotunda. Lewis\u2019s casket will then be moved to the top of the steps at the East Front of the Capitol for public viewing,\u201d our colleague writes.Another DMV-area tribute: \u201cFairfax County Public Schools is renaming Robert E. Lee High School in Northern Virginia for [Lewis], a historic switch that follows a wave of similar rechristenings throughout the South,\u201d Hannah Natanson reports.The civil rights icon will also lead one final march from Selma: \u201cAt 10 a.m. Sunday, his body will be carried on a lone pilgrimage across Edmund Pettus Bridge and on to Alabama\u2019s Capitol, where he will\u00a0lie in state at the Capitol from 2 to 7 p.m. Sunday,\u201d the Montgomery Advertiser's Brad Harper reports.In the MediaWHAT ELSE YOU NEED TO KNOW:ADAOC slams GOP congressman's explanation of their confrontation: \u201cSurrounded by Democratic colleagues, Rep.

Subscribe today.arrow-rightAs Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced the measures Thursday, the Australian government also issued a stark new travel advisory asking its roughly 100,000 citizens in Hong Kong to consider leaving the Asian business hub, citing the risk of arbitrary detention.The developments came as several Western governments signaled that they were taking a more coordinated tack a week after China introduced a security law to punish what it considers terrorist, separatist and subversive behavior in Hong Kong. Several foreign ministers from the Five Eyes intelligence-sharing group \u2014 the United States, Canada, Britain, Australia and New Zealand \u2014 publicly disclosed Thursday morning that members of the alliance had held a conference call to discuss Hong Kong.Australia's immigration move \u2014 which came after Britain, Hong Kong's former colonial ruler, unveiled a sweeping immigration offer last week \u2014 welcomes highly skilled workers and talented entrepreneurs in particular, Morrison told reporters.ADAD\"As a result of changes that have occurred in Hong Kong, there will be citizens of Hong Kong who may be looking to move elsewhere, to start a new life somewhere else, to take their skills, their businesses .\u2009.\u2009. and seek that opportunity elsewhere,\" Morrison said at a news conference as he declared Australia to be \"a great immigration nation.\"With Hong Kong security law, China writes broad international powers for itselfChina, which has been increasingly wary of what it considers a U.S.-led effort to sabotage its global rise, accused Australia of interfering in Hong Kong's affairs and warned of possible retaliation. The Morrison government risked \"lifting a rock only to hit its own feet,\" the Chinese Embassy in Canberra said in a harshly worded statement.Western countries have condemned China's new security law for Hong Kong as a violation of the agreement under which the city was handed over. Beijing had promised to safeguard the financial center's political freedoms and a high degree of autonomy until 2047. The security law sharply curtails political freedoms and applies globally, which legal experts have said could expose a citizen of any jurisdiction with an extradition treaty with Hong Kong to prosecution in China if the person promotes causes such as Hong Kong independence or publicly criticizes the ruling Communist Party.Mainland Chinese security agencies also opened a new office in a bustling Hong Kong commercial district on Wednesday to carry out their new duties under the law.That has raised the risk of Hong Kongers and foreigners alike running afoul of Chinese law enforcement. In its updated travel advisory Thursday, the Australian government told its citizens they \"could be deported or face possible transfer to mainland China for prosecution under mainland law.\"ADADThe Beijing government, for its part, has warned that it will wield the law to extinguish  Hong Kong's protest movement, which Beijing says is fanned by Western nonprofit groups and media outlets. Those Western organizations \"should be frightened\" upon the inauguration of the new national security office in Hong Kong staffed by mainland officials, according to a headline in the state-run Global Times this week.Already, there are signs that many Hong Kongers are planning to leave the city rather than live under Beijing's authoritarianism.Under Morrison's measures, Australia will extend temporary visas for Hong Kongers in the country and offer similar measures for future applicants, allowing them to stay for an additional five years and start out on a path to permanent residency. Notably, he offered incentives to businesses in Hong Kong to relocate to Australia, saying the country would welcome talented and entrepreneurial people who could generate jobs.ADADAustralia's actions followed Britain's move to provide residency and a path to citizenship for almost 3\u00a0million Hong Kongers born before the city's 1997 handover to China who are eligible for a special passport. Canada last week also suspended its extradition treaty with Hong Kong after China introduced the security law.Canada has accused China of arbitrarily detaining two of its citizens in retaliation for Canada's seizing Meng Wanzhou, a senior executive of the Chinese tech company Huawei, during a layover in Vancouver at the behest of the United States, which is seeking her extradition on fraud charges.\n\n\n\nCrawshaw reported from Hong Kong.", "comment": "241 Comments", "topic": "Asia & Pacific"}, {"cover": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/GV7HEXWQDEI6VATLZQ4U3ASOGU.jpghttps://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/GV7HEXWQDEI6VATLZQ4U3ASOGU.jpg", "title": "Big tech executives tout consumer benefits ahead of House hearing", "date": "Jul 29, 2020", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/07/28/bezos-antitrust-congressional-testimony/", "keyword": "China and Security", "website": "the Washington Post", "author": "Jay GreeneElizabeth Dwoskin", "content": "SEATTLE \u2014 Amazon chief executive Jeff Bezos on Tuesday cited the e-commerce company\u2019s \u201ccustomer obsession\u201d for fueling its business success as he attempts to counter congressional antitrust concerns a day ahead of a House hearing probing the power of tech giants.Support our journalism.

To fend off antitrust concerns, which often focus on consumer harm, Bezos noted 80 percent of Americans have a favorable impression of Amazon, according to \u201cleading independent polls\u201d that he did not identify.\u201cAt Amazon, customer obsession has made us what we are, and allowed us to do ever greater things,\u201d Bezos wrote.ADAD(Bezos owns The Washington Post.)Congress has battled airlines, banks, tobacco and baseball. Now it\u2019s preparing to clash with Big Tech.Bezos will swear an oath and appear at the hearing alongside Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg, Apple\u2019s Tim Cook and Google\u2019s Sundar Pichai. Lawmakers are examining the clout of the tech behemoths that represent a nearly $5 trillion slice of the U.S. economy.Other tech executives\u2019 planned testimony also surfaced Tuesday evening.At the hearing, Zuckerberg plans to emphasize Facebook\u2019s value in connecting people and supporting businesses during the pandemic, and the fact the social network competes with the companies at the hearing, according to testimony obtained by The Post. He plans to note that when Facebook moved its headquarters to the campus of a former tech giant, Sun Microsystems, he kept the company\u2019s sign up front to remind employees to stay competitive because success can be fleeting.Read Mark Zuckerberg's testimony to a House subcommitteeHe is also expected to emphasize Facebook\u2019s success has been grounded in the American values of democratic expression and competition, and compare that with the approach taken by China as a rising tech power.ADADIn his prepared testimony, Pichai touts the company\u2019s popular Internet services as major benefits for consumers and small businesses. Google products such as Search and Maps are free for everyone, he noted, and the company invests billions of dollars in research and development every year. He pointed to Amazon\u2019s Alexa and Twitter\u2019s news feed as competitors to Google Search, one of the areas the committee is probing.Pichai repeated a familiar claim that Google and its competitors in online advertising help bring down costs for advertisers. Google is the dominant player in digital advertising, and critics have questioned the company\u2019s power because it controls both the advertising framework and many of the websites on which ads appear.\u201cWe also deliberately build platforms that support the innovation of others,\u201d he said, pointing specifically to Google\u2019s Android operating system.Apple says recent changes to operating system improve user privacy, but some lawmakers see them as an effort to edge out its rivalsCook plans to stress consumers have a choice. Namely, they can use Google\u2019s operating system on a device made by Samsung or Google itself.ADAD\u201cThe smartphone market is fiercely competitive,\u201d he wrote, according to his prepared testimony.In recent months, developers that were once mum about the company\u2019s practices have come forward with public statements criticizing the way Apple uses its power.Cook tried to set Apple apart by highlighting the company\u2019s focus on privacy and security. He said Apple created the app store in part to help \u201ccreators large and small to not only bring their ideas to life, but to reach millions of users and build a successful business in the process.\u201d Without addressing any specific criticism of it, Cook called the App Store \u201can economic miracle,\u201d citing a study that found the App Store ecosystem facilitated $500 billion in commerce worldwide and $138 billion in the United States.Read Jeff Bezos\u2019s testimony to a House subcommitteeBezos\u2019s written testimony anticipates several of the topics lawmakers will probably grill him on during Wednesday\u2019s hearing. Rather than focus on online commerce, Bezos sought in his testimony to define the retail market more broadly and in a manner that diffuses Amazon\u2019s clout. Amazon accounts for less than 1 percent of the $25 trillion global retail market, Bezos wrote, and less than 4 percent of retail in the United States. Although Amazon rarely talks about competitors, Bezos specifically cited Target, Costco, Kroger and Walmart, which he added is \u201ca company more than twice Amazon\u2019s size.\u201d ADADA key area of focus for lawmakers is likely to be whether Amazon gives its own products unfair advantages over offerings from rivals on its digital marketplace, an allegation Bezos aimed to counter. The third-party sellers on Amazon account for about 60 percent of physical product sales on the site, and those sales are growing faster than Amazon\u2019s own retail sales, Bezos wrote.Amazon, Facebook and Google turn to deep network of political allies to battle back antitrust probesThe written testimony did not address the allegation that Amazon uses data collected from third-party merchants to launch its own competing products, an issue that lawmakers on the same subcommittee pressed an Amazon lawyer about a year ago.Bezos began his written testimony with a folksy refrain on his upbringing and the emergence of Amazon. He started by writing about his mother\u2019s struggles giving birth to him when she was a 17-year-old high school student in Albuquerque. And he wrote about his decision to launch Amazon, an idea his boss at the time told him was \u201ca better idea for somebody who didn\u2019t already have a good job.\u201d He worked in finance in New York at the time.ADAD\u201cWhen I\u2019m 80 and reflecting back, I want to have minimized the number of regrets that I have in my life,\u201d Bezos wrote. \u201cAnd most of our regrets are acts of omission \u2014 the things we didn\u2019t try, the paths untraveled.\u201d Lawmakers grill Amazon, Facebook, Google and Apple at antitrust hearingThe hearing Wednesday will be Bezos\u2019s first time testifying before Congress. In his written testimony, Bezos said, as he has previously, that he welcomes the inquiry.\u201cWe should scrutinize all large institutions, whether they\u2019re companies, government agencies, or non-profits,\u201d Bezos wrote. \u201cOur responsibility is to make sure we pass such scrutiny with flying colors.\u201d Elizabeth Dwoskin, Rachel Lerman and Reed Albergotti contributed to this report.", "comment": "10 Comments", "topic": "Technology"}, {"cover": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/FEBQXJWF7QI6VKBFQ4RAATSBKA.jpghttps://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/FEBQXJWF7QI6VKBFQ4RAATSBKA.jpg", "title": "How to safeguard against the worst possible outcomes in November", "date": "Jul 23, 2020", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/how-to-safeguard-against-the-worst-possible-outcomes-in-november/2020/07/23/4352d422-cd23-11ea-b0e3-d55bda07d66a_story.html", "keyword": "China and Security", "website": "the Washington Post", "author": "David Ignatius", "content": "What can U.S. citizens do to help protect the integrity of our November presidential election, after President Trump\u2019s refusal last Sunday to pledge he\u2019ll accept the outcome and his unfounded claims that the election could be \u201crigged\u201d?Support our journalism.

Knowing there\u2019s likely to be a challenge to November\u2019s results, state election officials should work diligently to provide safe and secure ways to count the votes, in-person and absentee. The coronavirus pandemic makes this planning harder \u2014 and more essential.Be patient, is the second obligation. It may take a week after the Nov. 3 vote to confirm a reliable national tally.

Our top military leaders \u2014 from Gen. Mark A. Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, on down \u2014 have stated emphatically that their oath is to the Constitution, not to Trump. And the Supreme Court under Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. this year reaffirmed the independence and the integrity of our judicial system.These are safeguards against the dark scenarios that some analysts are spinning. The worst could happen, to be sure, but there are strong counter-pressures to prevent a post-election crackup. And a caution to Trump nightmare scenarists on the left: Conspiracy theorizing by one side seems to encourage similar feverish thinking and mobilization by the other.The good news is that election-security experts have been working hard for months to prepare for November. Richard Hasen, a law professor at the University of California at Irvine, chairs an ad hoc committee that published a report in April that included 14\u00a0practical recommendations for legal, political, media and technology preparations to foster election security. Hasen published a book on the problem earlier this year: \u201cElection Meltdown: Dirty Tricks, Distrust and the Threat to Democracy.\u201dSign up for The Odds newsletter for election updates from data columnist David BylerHasen said in an email Thursday that since the group\u2019s report, \u201cLots of states have ramped up capacity to handle absentee ballots .\u2009.\u2009. and many are working on plans to run safe in-person polling places in the fall.\u201d At least 76 percent of American voters will be able to cast mail-in ballots in November, The Post reported Thursday. Fifteen states and the District of Columbia have made recent changes to make voting by mail easier, according to The Post.ADADMore states should adopt contingency plans in case of disruptions on Election Day, Hasen urged. \u201cWhat if there\u2019s a cyberattack that cuts the power in a city? What if the machines malfunction? States need to have back-up systems ready in case of election emergencies.\u201d And the media should educate the public about the likelihood of delayed counting, with so many absentee ballots. \u201cThere need to be people speaking out if anyone tries to claim victory early,\u201d he said in the email.State and local election supervisors take their jobs seriously, but voters need to make sure their state authorities are ready for an avalanche of absentee ballots in November. Ballot places and counting centers need enough money, people and equipment to operate smoothly. The time to monitor this \u2014 and fix any problems \u2014 is now.Because Trump has already signaled that he\u2019ll raise vote-fraud issues, independent monitors and fact checkers should get ready now to weigh unsubstantiated claims that results have been manipulated. And state election officials should plan how to counter misinformation that might spread on social media, advises Hasen.ADADWhat else can citizens do to get ready? More practical advice comes from Joshua Douglas, a law professor at the University of Kentucky and author of \u201cVote for US: How to Take Back Our Elections and Change the Future of Voting,\u201d published last year. He urges that voters double-check their own voter registration status to avoid last-minute problems; request mail-in ballots (in states where a request is needed) as early as possible; and avoid sharing election news without checking the source first.Lagging far behind former vice president Joe Biden in the polls, Trump has been working overtime to sow doubt about the November balloting. \u201cThe Democrats are trying to Rig the 2020 Election, plain and simple!\u201d he tweeted in May. \u201cBecause of MAIL-IN BALLOTS, 2020 will be the most RIGGED Election in our nation\u2019s history - unless this stupidity is ended,\u201d he tweeted last month.Four words for November: Be prepared; be patient.ADADRead more from David Ignatius\u2019s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.Read more:Read a letter in response to this column: Reporting on the election must be rigorousGreg Sargent: The coronavirus is infecting our entire electionPaul Waldman: This election is all about who gets to voteJennifer Rubin: Another Trump failure: His campaign against voting by mailMax Boot: What if Trump loses but insists he won?Catherine Rampell: Trump knows he\u2019s going to lose.

Last month, Mr. Trump ordered the pullout of a over a quarter of the U.S.\u00a0forces stationed in Germany, delivering a huge gift to Russian ruler Vladimir Putin, who wishes for nothing more than the disintegration of the NATO alliance.The Wall Street Journal further reports the Pentagon has delivered options to Mr. Trump for cutting back the 28,500 U.S. troops in South Korea. That would be a boon not just to North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un but also to the Chinese regime of Xi Jinping, which dreams of pushing the United States out of East Asia. It would clash conspicuously with Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign theme of toughness on China, and hand presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden an easy talking point.ADADYet \u201ccountless discussions\u201d with his national security team, as former national security adviser John Bolton described it, have failed to dislodge Mr.\u00a0Trump\u2019s fixed notion that host nations should pay the United States the full cost of stationing troops on bases \u2014 plus a 50 percent premium. In the case of South Korea, the president wants a payment by Seoul of $5 billion a year \u2014 or more than five times the subsidy it currently provides.According to Mr. Bolton\u2019s memoir, Mr. Trump repeatedly browbeat South Korean President Moon Jae-in about the issue, once telling him \u201cthe U.S. lost $4 billion a year for the privilege of South Korea selling us televisions.\u201d Mr. Moon tried to compromise, raising the South Korean payment to $926\u00a0million in 2019 and offering $1 billion a year over the following five years. Mr. Trump wouldn\u2019t have it: \u201cGet out of there if we don\u2019t get the five-billion-dollar deal,\u201d he demanded, in Mr. Bolton\u2019s account.The result has been an impasse, with only a partial deal for 2020. And now, predictably, come the leaks about a potential pullout, along with public threats from Mr. Trump\u2019s mouthpieces. \u201cWe want to bring troops from Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq, from South Korea, Japan and from Germany,\u201d Richard Grenell, Mr. Trump\u2019s former ambassador to Germany, told a German newspaper last month. Americans, he claimed, \u201care getting a bit tired of paying too much for the defense of other countries.\u201dADADActually, polls show public support for NATO and other alliances remains strong. Certainly that\u2019s true in Congress, where there is bipartisan support for legislation making a reduction of U.S. troops in Germany or South Korea conditional on a Pentagon certification that it would not harm U.S. security.

One of my favorite novels, John Irving\u2019s \u201cA Prayer for Owen Meany,\u201d is marred by this twitch. It was published in March 1989, an unfortunate mere eight months before the fall of the Berlin Wall. It is full of the then-conventional contempt for Reagan that accompanied the nuclear freeze movement, that condemned Reagan\u2019s deployment of Pershing II and cruise missiles in Europe, his embrace of strategic nuclear defense \u2014 derided as \u201cStar Wars,\u201d first by Sen. Edward M. Kennedy and then everywhere on the left \u2014 and, of course, opposition to Reagan\u2019s support for the contra rebels of Nicaragua, which reached hyper-pitch as Iran-contra scandal unfolded.\u201cThe White House, that whole criminal mob, those arrogant goons who see themselves as justified to operate above the law \u2014 they disgrace democracy by claiming what they do, they do for democracy,\u201d Irving has his narrator rail. \u201cThey should be in jail,\u201d he huffs after labeling Reagan an \u201cold geezer\u201d and slamming him with the innuendo of Hollywood stupidity routinely traded in by anti-Reagan newspaper columnists in those days.Now it is Trump taking the slings and arrows of the left, only with far more velocity and fervor, given the evolution of media. That unrelenting chorus of hatred doesn\u2019t change the central question: Who best to deal with the CCP: Trump or former vice president Joe Biden? Trump has been accused of being both too hard and too soft on Xi, Biden of being simply absent or compromised.ADADThe CCP uses loans and debt collection around the world the way the Soviets supported Cuban troops in Africa in the 1980s. Its military buildup is vast and rapid. The CCP\u2019s relentless campaigns of espionage make the Soviets of John le Carr\u00e9 novels seem quaint. Who is better equipped by disposition and experience to deal with the Dragon the way that Reagan dealt with the Bear?Trump\u2019s record and approach here are broad and familiar, as are the praise and criticism of that record. How about Biden\u2019s? Former secretary of defense Robert Gates famously wrote in 2014 that Biden \u201cbeen wrong on nearly every major foreign policy and national security issue over the past four decades.\u201dGates was a guest recently on my radio show to discuss his new book, \u201cExercise of Power.\u201d I asked him about Biden and specifically that comment. \u201cYeah, I stand by that statement,\u201d Gates replied. \u201cI will say, Hugh, it related mainly to things that had happened in the Cold War,\u201d he added, and expanded on the theme:ADAD\u201cBiden voted against every single arms program, I think, that Ronald Reagan put up on the Hill. He voted for the Iraq war and so on. So I do have those policy differences with him. In the Obama administration, we did have a very deep disagreement on Afghanistan. And that was a big deal.\u201d Gates noted occasional agreement with Biden on matters, including President Barack Obama\u2019s policies on Libya and Egypt, but he added:\u201cI also think that the vice president had some issues with the military. And I wrote in \u2018Duty\u2019 [Gates\u2019s memoir] about how he would warn the president that he was being boxed in, that the military was trying to take away his options and so on.

But with the benefits soon set to expire and the economy showing new signs of strain, Trump administration officials have begun opening the door to accepting a narrower version of what Congress previously approved,\u201d Jeff Stein, Andrew Van Dam and Eli Rosenberg report.\u201cOne potential compromise discussed by Republican lawmakers would involve cutting the unemployment benefit from $600 per week to between $200 and $400 per week and making up at least part of the difference by sending another round of $1,200 stimulus payments. \u2026 On Monday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said the next package would include \u2018unemployment insurance for those unable to get back to work,\u2019 though did not identify how much aid would be necessary.\u201d\u00a0Faulty data raises questions about how many jobs PPP saved.My Post colleagues dove into the program\u2019s released data, and their analysis uncovered a mess. It \u201cshows that many companies are reported to have \u2018retained\u2019 far more workers than they employ. Likewise, in some cases the agency\u2019s jobs claim for entire industries surpasses the total number of workers in those sectors. And for more than 875,000 borrowers, the data shows that zero jobs were supported or no information is listed at all \u2026\u201d Jonathan O\u2019Connell, Emma Brown, Steven Rich and Aaron Gregg report.ADAD\u201cThe flaws raise questions about the claims by the Trump administration that 51 million jobs were \u2018supported\u2019 by the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), which has been a rare bright spot for the administration at a time of a surging coronavirus pandemic and a suddenly stalling economic recovery. Many economists credit the program with helping staunch the deep wounds in the job market by offering forgivable loans to small businesses that rehire or keep workers on their payroll.\u201dWhat else they found: \u201cFor every loan offered to businesses under the program, the SBA lists a number of \u2018jobs retained.\u2019 But in numerous cases, the listed number of jobs retained exceeded the total employment at the company, according to interviews with individual loan recipients. The Post found half a dozen businesses that said they had fewer employees than the SBA reported the businesses had retained. Bankers also said employment figures for hundreds of businesses had been incorrectly reported by the SBA.\u201dSmall business owners say they need more from the PPP. Of those participating in the program, 84 percent say they will run out of funding by the first week of August, a survey by Goldman Sachs's 10,000 Small Businesses finds. And just 16 percent said they were confident they could maintain their payrolls without more government funding.\u00a0Coronavirus falloutTrump administration reverses on plan requiring international students to take in-person classes.Top universities had sued to block the rule from going into effect: \u201cThe abrupt reversal, disclosed in a federal court in Boston, came a little more than a week after U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement issued an edict that stunned U.S. higher education leaders and students worldwide,\u201d Nick Anderson and Susan Svrluga report.ADAD\u201cIn their suit, Harvard and MIT argued that the Trump administration\u2019s action violated the Administrative Procedure Act, which governs how federal agencies make rules. They also claimed the ICE decision was a political move calculated to force universities to reopen campuses and hold classes in person despite the soaring toll of the coronavirus in death and illness. Scores of universities supported their lawsuit, along with more than 70 higher education associations. So did Google, Twitter, Facebook and more than a dozen other tech companies.\u201d\u00a0More from the U.S.:At least 3,410,000 coronavirus cases have been reported; at least 133,000 have died.Dunford signals he won't chair coronavirus panel: \u201cFormer Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman Joseph F.

The White House trade adviser's attack on the administration's top infectious disease expert is just the latest example of a Trump official taking open aim at the public health official. \u201cDr. Anthony Fauci has a good bedside manner with the public, but he has been wrong about everything I have interacted with him on,\u201d Navarro writes.From the corporate front:Delta loses $2 billion on investments in foreign airlines: The airline \u201cspent years amassing equity stakes in foreign airlines from the U.K. to Chile to grow internationally and gain sway over those carriers. The pandemic has upended those plans and is proving costly as financial turmoil hits airlines around the world,\u201d CNBC\u2019s Leslie Josephs reports. \u201cDelta posted a net loss of $5.7 billion\u00a0for the second quarter, its largest quarterly loss in 12 years.

Instead, he focused his remarks on attacking presumptive Democratic opponent Joe Biden in a campaign-style event in the White House Rose Garden,\u201d Colby Itkowitz reports.ADChina threatens to sanction Lockheed Martin: \u201cBeijing did not spell out what these measures would entail, and Lockheed Martin has very little exposure to China. But the announcement, coming just a day after China sanctioned four American officials, represents another salvo in the hostilities between Beijing and Washington,\u201d Anna Fifield reports.\u201cThe State Department last week said it had approved a $620 million deal so that Taiwan could refurbish its Patriot surface-to-air, or PAC-3, missiles and extend their operational life to 30 years. \u2026 Lockheed Martin does not appear to have much in the way of operations in China. The company generated 9.7 percent of its revenue in the Asia-Pacific region last year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg News, almost all of it with U.S. allies and partners such as Japan, South Korea and Singapore.\u201dFor tech firms, doing business in Hong Kong is a lot riskier now: \u201cSpooked by a law that takes aim at Hong Kong\u2019s previously unrestricted Internet, tech giants are scrambling for legal and expertise on how to navigate a market that has changed fundamentally,\u201d Timothy McLaughlin and Shibani Mahtani report from Hong Kong.\u201cTech firms admit that pausing data requests is a temporary solution \u2014 a \u2018way to buy time,\u2019 as one employee at a U.S. social media company put it. In grappling with Hong Kong\u2019s new reality, analysts say, companies will have to weigh their approach and values against their interest in the Chinese market, a trade-off that has long dogged Silicon Valley. \u2026 Samm Sacks, a senior fellow at Yale Law School\u2019s Paul Tsai China Center, added that technology companies must adjust to the reality that the \u2018one country, two systems\u2019 framework under which Hong Kong was supposed to largely govern itself is \u2018no longer a backstop and doesn\u2019t get them out of dealing with China.\u2019\u201dBritain bars Huawei from its 5G networks: \u201cBritain will bar new deployments of Huawei equipment in its fledgling high-speed 5G network, the government said Tuesday, delivering a major blow to the Chinese technology giant and a significant win for the Trump administration, which has been pressing allies to shun the firm,\u201d Ellen Nakashima and William Booth report.\u201cThe British announcement marks a significant moment in the movement away from China in the global 5G competition, especially among advanced democracies increasingly concerned that the company\u2019s ties to the Communist government create unacceptable security risks. \u2026 Now, with Britain joining the anti-Huawei fold, all \u2018Five Eye\u2019 members of the world\u2019s most powerful intelligence-sharing alliance \u2014 Britain, the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand \u2014 or wireless carriers in their countries, have effectively excluded or are moving to exclude Chinese firms from their 5G networks.\u201d\u00a0Campaign 2020\u00a0Biden unveils $2 trillion climate plan.The former president says it would create 1 million jobs: \u201cJoe Biden unveiled a proposal to transform the nation\u2019s energy industry, pledging to eliminate carbon pollution from power plants by 2035 and spend $2 trillion to turbocharge the clean energy economy,\u201d Matt Viser and Dino Grandoni report.\u201cThe plan would significantly reduce the United States\u2019 reliance on fossil fuels, and the 15-year timeline for a 100 percent clean electricity standard is far more ambitious than anything Biden has previously proposed. \u2026 The presumptive Democratic presidential nominee proposed upgrading 4 million buildings and weatherizing 2 million homes over four years, which his campaign estimates would create 1 million jobs. Homeowners would be given cash rebates to upgrade home appliances and install more efficient windows.

But with the benefits soon set to expire and the economy showing new signs of strain, Trump administration officials have begun opening the door to accepting a narrower version of what Congress previously approved,\u201d Jeff Stein, Andrew Van Dam and Eli Rosenberg report.\u201cOne potential compromise discussed by Republican lawmakers would involve cutting the unemployment benefit from $600 per week to between $200 and $400 per week and making up at least part of the difference by sending another round of $1,200 stimulus payments. \u2026 On Monday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said the next package would include \u2018unemployment insurance for those unable to get back to work,\u2019 though did not identify how much aid would be necessary.\u201d\u00a0Faulty data raises questions about how many jobs PPP saved.My Post colleagues dove into the program\u2019s released data, and their analysis uncovered a mess. It \u201cshows that many companies are reported to have \u2018retained\u2019 far more workers than they employ. Likewise, in some cases the agency\u2019s jobs claim for entire industries surpasses the total number of workers in those sectors. And for more than 875,000 borrowers, the data shows that zero jobs were supported or no information is listed at all \u2026\u201d Jonathan O\u2019Connell, Emma Brown, Steven Rich and Aaron Gregg report.ADAD\u201cThe flaws raise questions about the claims by the Trump administration that 51 million jobs were \u2018supported\u2019 by the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), which has been a rare bright spot for the administration at a time of a surging coronavirus pandemic and a suddenly stalling economic recovery. Many economists credit the program with helping staunch the deep wounds in the job market by offering forgivable loans to small businesses that rehire or keep workers on their payroll.\u201dWhat else they found: \u201cFor every loan offered to businesses under the program, the SBA lists a number of \u2018jobs retained.\u2019 But in numerous cases, the listed number of jobs retained exceeded the total employment at the company, according to interviews with individual loan recipients. The Post found half a dozen businesses that said they had fewer employees than the SBA reported the businesses had retained. Bankers also said employment figures for hundreds of businesses had been incorrectly reported by the SBA.\u201dSmall business owners say they need more from the PPP. Of those participating in the program, 84 percent say they will run out of funding by the first week of August, a survey by Goldman Sachs's 10,000 Small Businesses finds. And just 16 percent said they were confident they could maintain their payrolls without more government funding.\u00a0Coronavirus falloutTrump administration reverses on plan requiring international students to take in-person classes.Top universities had sued to block the rule from going into effect: \u201cThe abrupt reversal, disclosed in a federal court in Boston, came a little more than a week after U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement issued an edict that stunned U.S. higher education leaders and students worldwide,\u201d Nick Anderson and Susan Svrluga report.ADAD\u201cIn their suit, Harvard and MIT argued that the Trump administration\u2019s action violated the Administrative Procedure Act, which governs how federal agencies make rules. They also claimed the ICE decision was a political move calculated to force universities to reopen campuses and hold classes in person despite the soaring toll of the coronavirus in death and illness.

The same day, the state\u2019s largest private employer, Walmart, announced it will implement a requirement that shoppers wear masks in its stores nationwide.Support our journalism. Subscribe today.arrow-rightThe developments represent the continuation of a Trump-era theme: big business moving into a void left by elected officials to provide leadership on an urgent public need. On issue after issue, from climate change to racial justice, corporate chiefs have been stepping up where the Trump administration has shied away.\u00a0But their pandemic response also demonstrates the folly of relying on that model: The Trump administration could have imposed a national mask-wearing mandate back in early April, when the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention first recommended the practice. Instead, President Trump chose to politicize the issue, mocking Democratic rival Joe Biden and others for donning face-coverings. And now four months into a pandemic that has claimed more than 134,000 lives and swollen the jobless ranks to some 18 million people, the nation remains a patchwork of rules on the matter and other obvious steps to stop the spread of the virus.Walmart\u2019s nationwide mandate could prove a watershed moment in the mask debate.There is already evidence that the announcement by the nation\u2019s biggest employer \u2014 a retail staple of rural and exurban Republican strongholds \u2014 is turning the tide on what had become another front in a toxic partisan fight.ADADHours after Walmart made its announcement, supermarket chain Kroger said it is following suit with a nationwide rule for shoppers in its stores that will take effect next week. Kohl\u2019s, too, announced it will require shoppers to mask up in its 1,100 nationwide starting Monday.And the National Retail Federation piggybacked on the Walmart announcement to encourage all retailers to adopt the policy, saying it hoped the news proves to be a \u201ctipping point\u201d on the matter. \u201cWorkers serving customers should not have to make a critical decision as to whether they should risk exposure to infection or lose their jobs because a minority of people refuse to wear masks in order to help stop the spread of the deadly coronavirus,\u201d the trade association said in its statement.General counsel for the federation, Stephanie Martz, suggested that Walmart\u2019s market and cultural pull could have an outsize impact. \u201cThe more stores that are able to make announcements like this, the more it will help move the needle culturally and make it accepted that this is what you do when you shop in an enclosed space,\u201d she said. \u201cThe fact that this has become politicized is really disappointing.\u201dWalmart wasn\u2019t first into the breach. It joins a list of major retailers that have already imposed mask-wearing requirements, including Apple, AT&T, Costco, Dollar Tree, H-E-B, Starbucks and Verizon. And half the states now have adopted mandates, with Alabama the latest to announce one Wednesday. But Arizona and Florida, two epicenters of the pandemic\u2019s resurgence, remain among the holdouts. In Georgia, another hotspot, Gov. Brian Kemp (R) issued an executive order Wednesday banning cites and counties from adopting their own face-covering requirements.The holes in the national patchwork show the limits of corporate leadership in a public health crisis.Trump donned a mask in public for the first time Saturday. But he continues to resist a federal mandate, and that is costing lives and dragging out the economic recovery. An analysis by Goldman Sachs economists last month found a federal mask requirement would cut the daily rise in cases by a full percentage point while salvaging roughly $1 trillion of economic activity. Findings by other public health researchers back up the firm\u2019s conclusions.ADADCDC Director Robert Redfield said widespread use of the face coverings could bring the pandemic to heel in a matter of weeks:Yet the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the federal agency charged with enforcing workplace safety, has all but abandoned any effort to enforce standards as employees have returned to the job. \u201cOSHA has received thousands of complaints from workers who say their employers have failed to take basic steps to mitigate infection risks in industries from health care to construction and beyond,\u201d Eli Rosenberg writes. \"Loren Sweatt, the Trump appointee who leads the agency, disclosed during\u00a0congressional testimony in May\u00a0that OSHA had issued a citation for only one of the complaints.\u201dOn earnings calls this week, big bank executives emphasized the pandemic will continue to set the economy\u2019s course.\u00a0\u201cThe pandemic has a grip on the economy, and it doesn\u2019t seem likely to loosen until vaccines are widely available,\u201d Citigroup chief executive Michael Corbat told investors.ADADGiven that widely-acknowledged state of affairs, it might have been reasonable to expect corporate leaders to embrace mask requirements earlier. But chief executives face their own set of pressures, from trying to meet investor demands for short-term returns to attempting to steer clear of partisan food-fights.Email correspondence between business lobbyists and state officials unearthed by The Post\u2019s Isaac Stanley-Becker reveal a different priority for industry leaders: A concerted and in many cases successful push to get states to reopen more quickly. \u201cThe sway of business interests extends beyond \u2018safe harbor\u2019 from coronavirus lawsuits, a central public cause of business groups that critics say invites risky behavior and constrains workers who get sick,\u201d he wrote last week. \"In Georgia, [Gov. Brian] Kemp\u2019s top aides were also inundated by private appeals from corporations and conservative nonprofit organizations, email records show.\u201dThe crisis is \u201chighlighting the value of political leadership,\u201d says Harry W. Clark, who is advising both corporate and elected leaders on their covid-19 responses. \u201cIf you relied exclusively on epidemiologists, you would never reopen. And if you relied exclusively on business leaders, who are worried about The Street, you would open too early. Governors have to balance those interests and make difficult decisions\u201d that won\u2019t prove themselves for weeks.Public opinion is ahead of the belated moves by political and corporate leaders to embrace safety measures.Trump is losing ground to former vice president Joe Biden in the presidential race as voters sour on the president\u2019s handling of the coronavirus, a new Wall Street Journal/ NBC News poll found.ADAD\u201cThe coronavirus crisis continued to drag on Mr. Trump\u2019s chances of winning re-election, with 37% of voters approving of his handling of the continuing outbreak and 59% disapproving,\u201d the WSJ\u2019s Andrew Restuccia writes of the survey, which found Biden extending his lead over Trump to 11 points, up from 7 points last month.And the poll found an overwhelming majority of voters, including a majority of Trump supporters, reporting they wear masks in public now. More from Restuccia: \u201cBy more than 2-to-1, voters said they are more likely to vote for a candidate who is more focused on stopping the spread of the virus than on reopening businesses. Nearly three-quarters of voters said they always wear a mask while shopping, working or when they\u2019re around people outside their homes, an 11-percentage-point increase from last month. The share of Trump supporters who say they always wear masks climbed 15 points since June, from 39% to 54%.\u201dAgainst that backdrop, Walmart\u2019s move looks like less of a bold stroke and more of a lagging indicator. \u201cThe fact that Walmart is doing this now is proof of why you need the federal government to step in and set standards early on,\u201d says Debbie Berkowitz, a program director with the National Employment Law Project, a pro-labor group. \u201cWe\u2019re now four months into this pandemic\u2026 There are consequences when the federal government fails to step in where they should.\u201dADADPROGRAMMING NOTE: The Finance 202 is taking a break tomorrow.

The news sent Moderna shares up 6.9 percent.\u201dADADThe S&P 500 is now down less than 1 percent on the year.\u00a0Goldman keeps profits steady while rivals falter: \u201cGoldman was buoyed by its Wall Street roots, seizing on a flood of corporate fundraising deals and torrid trading markets to post its second-highest quarterly revenue ever, at $13.3 billion. Those fees were slightly offset by higher reserves for future loan defaults in what is expected to be a sustained and deep recession,\u201d the Wall Street Journal\u2019s Liz Hoffman reports.\u201cThe challenge now for Chief Executive David Solomon: not to learn the wrong lesson. Goldman hasn\u2019t seen this kind of activity since 2010. Its ability then to wring profits from economic turmoil bolstered its mythical status as a Wall Street heavyweight and delayed its push into steadier businesses such as consumer banking and asset management that could help balance the firm when this crisis passes.\u201dADADBiggest banks gain $10 billion on Fed moves: \u201cMarch presented the threat of a credit freeze along the lines of 2008. Instead, the Federal Reserve\u2019s efforts to keep debt markets flowing have things looking more like 2009, with concerns about the U.S. economy abundant but times still great on Wall Street trading floors,\u201d Bloomberg News\u2019s Jennifer Surane and Steven Lubbers report.\u201cThe Fed\u2019s moves have meant a $10 billion windfall for the biggest U.S. banks as their bond traders seized on big market swings to set new records, and their bankers arranged a slew of debt deals for companies desperate to raise cash. That helped keep JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc. profitable despite a surge in loan-loss provisions, and even delivered a surprise earnings increase at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. The market bonanza has for now eased fears about the type of bank capital concerns that fueled the last crisis and prompted government bailouts.\u201d\u00a0Another 1.25 million Americans expected to have filed for unemployment benefits (Yahoo Finance)ADADJune retail sales should be strong from a pickup in spending before new virus outbreak slowed activity (CNBC)Coronavirus falloutFrom the U.S.:Republicans scale back convention: \"The Republican Party will hold a scaled-back convention in Jacksonville, Fla., next month that includes a mix of outdoor and indoor venues, according to a letter sent to delegates,\" Josh Dawsey reports. \"The Thursday letter from Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel, obtained by The Washington Post, said admittance will be limited to only regular delegates for the first three days of the convention \u2014 or about 2,500 people.

Companies could face financial penalties of up to $130,000 if they are found to have violated the policies,\u201d Eli Rosenberg reports.Consumer appetite for cars, homes bolsters economy: \u201cConsumers have continued spending on big-ticket items such as vehicles and homes during the pandemic, helping support the U.S. economy as it battles a surge in cases and renewed business shutdowns,\u201d the Wall Street Journal's Sarah Chaney reports.At the lodckdown's worst, 10 states had less than 50 percent of people working: \u201cNevada was one of 10 states where less than half their populations were working in May amid economic lockdowns of most non-essential businesses.

GriffithsOklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt (R), who has refused to implement a statewide mask-wearing mandate, on Wednesday became the nation\u2019s first governor to test positive for the coronavirus. The same day, the state\u2019s largest private employer, Walmart, announced it will implement a requirement that shoppers wear masks in its stores nationwide.Support our journalism. Subscribe today.arrow-rightThe developments represent the continuation of a Trump-era theme: big business moving into a void left by elected officials to provide leadership on an urgent public need. On issue after issue, from climate change to racial justice, corporate chiefs have been stepping up where the Trump administration has shied away.\u00a0But their pandemic response also demonstrates the folly of relying on that model: The Trump administration could have imposed a national mask-wearing mandate back in early April, when the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention first recommended the practice. Instead, President Trump chose to politicize the issue, mocking Democratic rival Joe Biden and others for donning face-coverings. And now four months into a pandemic that has claimed more than 134,000 lives and swollen the jobless ranks to some 18 million people, the nation remains a patchwork of rules on the matter and other obvious steps to stop the spread of the virus.Walmart\u2019s nationwide mandate could prove a watershed moment in the mask debate.There is already evidence that the announcement by the nation\u2019s biggest employer \u2014 a retail staple of rural and exurban Republican strongholds \u2014 is turning the tide on what had become another front in a toxic partisan fight.ADADHours after Walmart made its announcement, supermarket chain Kroger said it is following suit with a nationwide rule for shoppers in its stores that will take effect next week. Kohl\u2019s, too, announced it will require shoppers to mask up in its 1,100 nationwide starting Monday.And the National Retail Federation piggybacked on the Walmart announcement to encourage all retailers to adopt the policy, saying it hoped the news proves to be a \u201ctipping point\u201d on the matter. \u201cWorkers serving customers should not have to make a critical decision as to whether they should risk exposure to infection or lose their jobs because a minority of people refuse to wear masks in order to help stop the spread of the deadly coronavirus,\u201d the trade association said in its statement.General counsel for the federation, Stephanie Martz, suggested that Walmart\u2019s market and cultural pull could have an outsize impact. \u201cThe more stores that are able to make announcements like this, the more it will help move the needle culturally and make it accepted that this is what you do when you shop in an enclosed space,\u201d she said. \u201cThe fact that this has become politicized is really disappointing.\u201dWalmart wasn\u2019t first into the breach. It joins a list of major retailers that have already imposed mask-wearing requirements, including Apple, AT&T, Costco, Dollar Tree, H-E-B, Starbucks and Verizon. And half the states now have adopted mandates, with Alabama the latest to announce one Wednesday. But Arizona and Florida, two epicenters of the pandemic\u2019s resurgence, remain among the holdouts. In Georgia, another hotspot, Gov. Brian Kemp (R) issued an executive order Wednesday banning cites and counties from adopting their own face-covering requirements.The holes in the national patchwork show the limits of corporate leadership in a public health crisis.Trump donned a mask in public for the first time Saturday. But he continues to resist a federal mandate, and that is costing lives and dragging out the economic recovery. An analysis by Goldman Sachs economists last month found a federal mask requirement would cut the daily rise in cases by a full percentage point while salvaging roughly $1 trillion of economic activity. Findings by other public health researchers back up the firm\u2019s conclusions.ADADCDC Director Robert Redfield said widespread use of the face coverings could bring the pandemic to heel in a matter of weeks:Yet the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the federal agency charged with enforcing workplace safety, has all but abandoned any effort to enforce standards as employees have returned to the job. \u201cOSHA has received thousands of complaints from workers who say their employers have failed to take basic steps to mitigate infection risks in industries from health care to construction and beyond,\u201d Eli Rosenberg writes. \"Loren Sweatt, the Trump appointee who leads the agency, disclosed during\u00a0congressional testimony in May\u00a0that OSHA had issued a citation for only one of the complaints.\u201dOn earnings calls this week, big bank executives emphasized the pandemic will continue to set the economy\u2019s course.\u00a0\u201cThe pandemic has a grip on the economy, and it doesn\u2019t seem likely to loosen until vaccines are widely available,\u201d Citigroup chief executive Michael Corbat told investors.ADADGiven that widely-acknowledged state of affairs, it might have been reasonable to expect corporate leaders to embrace mask requirements earlier. But chief executives face their own set of pressures, from trying to meet investor demands for short-term returns to attempting to steer clear of partisan food-fights.Email correspondence between business lobbyists and state officials unearthed by The Post\u2019s Isaac Stanley-Becker reveal a different priority for industry leaders: A concerted and in many cases successful push to get states to reopen more quickly. \u201cThe sway of business interests extends beyond \u2018safe harbor\u2019 from coronavirus lawsuits, a central public cause of business groups that critics say invites risky behavior and constrains workers who get sick,\u201d he wrote last week. \"In Georgia, [Gov. Brian] Kemp\u2019s top aides were also inundated by private appeals from corporations and conservative nonprofit organizations, email records show.\u201dThe crisis is \u201chighlighting the value of political leadership,\u201d says Harry W. Clark, who is advising both corporate and elected leaders on their covid-19 responses. \u201cIf you relied exclusively on epidemiologists, you would never reopen. And if you relied exclusively on business leaders, who are worried about The Street, you would open too early. Governors have to balance those interests and make difficult decisions\u201d that won\u2019t prove themselves for weeks.Public opinion is ahead of the belated moves by political and corporate leaders to embrace safety measures.Trump is losing ground to former vice president Joe Biden in the presidential race as voters sour on the president\u2019s handling of the coronavirus, a new Wall Street Journal/ NBC News poll found.ADAD\u201cThe coronavirus crisis continued to drag on Mr. Trump\u2019s chances of winning re-election, with 37% of voters approving of his handling of the continuing outbreak and 59% disapproving,\u201d the WSJ\u2019s Andrew Restuccia writes of the survey, which found Biden extending his lead over Trump to 11 points, up from 7 points last month.And the poll found an overwhelming majority of voters, including a majority of Trump supporters, reporting they wear masks in public now. More from Restuccia: \u201cBy more than 2-to-1, voters said they are more likely to vote for a candidate who is more focused on stopping the spread of the virus than on reopening businesses. Nearly three-quarters of voters said they always wear a mask while shopping, working or when they\u2019re around people outside their homes, an 11-percentage-point increase from last month. The share of Trump supporters who say they always wear masks climbed 15 points since June, from 39% to 54%.\u201dAgainst that backdrop, Walmart\u2019s move looks like less of a bold stroke and more of a lagging indicator. \u201cThe fact that Walmart is doing this now is proof of why you need the federal government to step in and set standards early on,\u201d says Debbie Berkowitz, a program director with the National Employment Law Project, a pro-labor group. \u201cWe\u2019re now four months into this pandemic\u2026 There are consequences when the federal government fails to step in where they should.\u201dADADPROGRAMMING NOTE: The Finance 202 is taking a break tomorrow.

The news sent Moderna shares up 6.9 percent.\u201dADADThe S&P 500 is now down less than 1 percent on the year.\u00a0Goldman keeps profits steady while rivals falter: \u201cGoldman was buoyed by its Wall Street roots, seizing on a flood of corporate fundraising deals and torrid trading markets to post its second-highest quarterly revenue ever, at $13.3 billion. Those fees were slightly offset by higher reserves for future loan defaults in what is expected to be a sustained and deep recession,\u201d the Wall Street Journal\u2019s Liz Hoffman reports.\u201cThe challenge now for Chief Executive David Solomon: not to learn the wrong lesson. Goldman hasn\u2019t seen this kind of activity since 2010. Its ability then to wring profits from economic turmoil bolstered its mythical status as a Wall Street heavyweight and delayed its push into steadier businesses such as consumer banking and asset management that could help balance the firm when this crisis passes.\u201dADADBiggest banks gain $10 billion on Fed moves: \u201cMarch presented the threat of a credit freeze along the lines of 2008. Instead, the Federal Reserve\u2019s efforts to keep debt markets flowing have things looking more like 2009, with concerns about the U.S. economy abundant but times still great on Wall Street trading floors,\u201d Bloomberg News\u2019s Jennifer Surane and Steven Lubbers report.\u201cThe Fed\u2019s moves have meant a $10 billion windfall for the biggest U.S. banks as their bond traders seized on big market swings to set new records, and their bankers arranged a slew of debt deals for companies desperate to raise cash. That helped keep JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc. profitable despite a surge in loan-loss provisions, and even delivered a surprise earnings increase at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. The market bonanza has for now eased fears about the type of bank capital concerns that fueled the last crisis and prompted government bailouts.\u201d\u00a0Another 1.25 million Americans expected to have filed for unemployment benefits (Yahoo Finance)ADADJune retail sales should be strong from a pickup in spending before new virus outbreak slowed activity (CNBC)Coronavirus falloutFrom the U.S.:Republicans scale back convention: \"The Republican Party will hold a scaled-back convention in Jacksonville, Fla., next month that includes a mix of outdoor and indoor venues, according to a letter sent to delegates,\" Josh Dawsey reports. \"The Thursday letter from Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel, obtained by The Washington Post, said admittance will be limited to only regular delegates for the first three days of the convention \u2014 or about 2,500 people.

Companies could face financial penalties of up to $130,000 if they are found to have violated the policies,\u201d Eli Rosenberg reports.Consumer appetite for cars, homes bolsters economy: \u201cConsumers have continued spending on big-ticket items such as vehicles and homes during the pandemic, helping support the U.S. economy as it battles a surge in cases and renewed business shutdowns,\u201d the Wall Street Journal's Sarah Chaney reports.At the lodckdown's worst, 10 states had less than 50 percent of people working: \u201cNevada was one of 10 states where less than half their populations were working in May amid economic lockdowns of most non-essential businesses. Hawaii, Michigan, Florida, Mississippi, West Virginia, California, Louisiana, New York and New Mexico also had less than half of the population employed,\u201d Bloomberg News's Alexandre Tanzi reports.From the corporate front:Online shopping is taking a toll on retailers: \u201cMargins for the hardest-hit nonessential retailers \u2014 including mall-based clothing chains \u2014 on average are this year likely to be about half what they were in 2019, according to credit ratings agency S&P Global.

The environmental and financial considerations that originally drove production of active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) offshore remain compelling, they said.\u201cThe investment that would be needed to restart some of the API business here in the U.S., especially with much more stringent [environmental] and wastewater requirements, it\u2019s really unrealistic to think that could be done and still be price competitive,\u201d said Susan Capie, managing director of PharmaVantage, a consultancy in Babylon, N.Y.Phlow Corp. of Richmond will lead a private sector team that will use a continuous chemical process rather than the step-by-step approach of traditional pharmaceutical manufacturing. AMPAC Fine Chemicals, Civica Rx, and the Medicines-for-All Institute at Virginia Commonwealth University round out the partnership.ADADThe Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), a government agency recently embroiled in controversy over the demotion of its former chief, awarded Phlow the contract.During the initial four years, the company will develop a \u201crapid surge\u201d capability for critically-needed medicines and their ingredients and build advanced manufacturing facilities to produce drugs that are in short supply, Eric Edwards, Phlow\u2019s chief executive, said in an interview.The company promises higher yields, less waste and more affordable medicines as a result of its continuous chemical process. Initial planning began about a year ago, Edwards said. Once the coronavirus materialized, he said he warned administration officials in early February of inevitable drug shortfalls.ADPhlow later submitted a bid under a BARDA contract competition, he said.AD\u201cI think it\u2019s a good thing, a really interesting step forward to put an investment into our pharmacy supply chain,\u201d said Erin Fox, pharmacist and drug-shortages expert at the University of Utah hospital.Maintaining adequate drug supplies \u2014 such as sedatives and painkillers for ventilator patients \u2014 has been a problem amid soaring demand during the pandemic, she said. Such shortages could worsen, as states reopen and hospitals resume performing elective surgeries.\u201cYou need some of those very same drugs for surgery that you need for critically ill and intubated patients with covid-19,\u201d she said.ADTo date, Phlow already has delivered to the government 1.6 million doses of antibiotics, sedatives, painkillers and blood pressure drugs, Edwards said.Watchdog office says \u2018reasonable grounds\u2019 to believe ouster of vaccine official was retaliatory, his lawyers sayThe U.S. imports annually more than $150 billion worth of biologics, human and animal drugs, and medical devices, the Food and Drug Administration said last year.ADSome experts were skeptical that Phlow\u2019s relatively modest contract will mean much change. \u201cThis production has moved abroad for business reasons,\u201d said Thomas Bollyky, director of the Council on Foreign Relations\u2019 Global Health Program. \u201cSo it\u2019s going to have to operate [in the U.S.] with a subsidy. The question is: how long are we willing to maintain that subsidy?\u201dADThe contract can be extended to a 10-year total of $812 million, according to the Health and Human Services Department, which oversees BARDA. The agency\u2019s former director, Rick Bright, recently filed a whistleblower complaint alleging he was dismissed from his job after resisting pressure from administration officials to stockpile the anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine, an unproven covid-19 treatment.Phlow is organized as a public benefit corporation, a for-profit venture that prioritizes positive social impact as one of its goals.ADEdwards is a veteran pharmaceutical executive who spent 18 years at Kal\u00e9o, a company that produced auto-injectible pens, including for emergency anti-allergy treatment.ADHis tenure at that company, which he co-founded with his twin brother, was the subject of a Senate investigation. Between 2014 and 2017, at the height of the opioid crisis, Kal\u00e9o raised the price of a naloxone auto-injector, which reverses the effects of drug overdoses, from $575 to $4,100, according to a report by the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs\u2019 permanent subcommittee on investigations. The increases cost taxpayers $142 million, the subcommittee concluded.In response, a Phlow spokesman said that Edwards \u201chad nothing to do with drug pricing decisions\u201d while at Kal\u00e9o. Edwards, who remains a Kal\u00e9o shareholder, left the company more than one year ago on \u201cgood terms,\u201d the spokesman said.ADPhlow\u2019s co-founder, Frank Gupton, also heads VCU\u2019s Medicines for All Institute, which receives funding from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Rosemary Gibson, a senior advisor at the Hastings Center, and a prominent critic of U.S. dependence upon Chinese pharmaceuticals, is a member of the company\u2019s board.ADThe United States still manufactures many cutting-edge biotech drugs, which tend to be more profitable, branded medications. Such drugs, typically delivered by injection or infusion, are produced by genetically modified cells in a complicated process dominated by Western manufacturers.The chemical synthesis used to make traditional pills, including most generics, is a more routine form of manufacturing that shifted to China and India decades ago.Capie said China imported most of its drugs before boosting domestic production in the 1980s. \u201cWhen China started ramping up their own industry, the goal was to be self-sufficient in what they needed rather than having to import,\u201d she said.ADADAt the same time, increasing price competition among generic drugs in the West prompted U.S. and European manufacturers to outsource production of those medicines to low-cost factories in Asia, she said.Production of the starter chemicals used to make drugs \u2014 the most environmentally toxic step of the process \u2014 has shifted to India as China, the former leader, has raised its environmental standards, Capie said. China now imports these starter chemicals to make intermediate powders known as active pharmaceutical ingredients, or API. Then Chinese or Indian companies turn that API into finished pills.Quality concerns have dogged Indian and Chinese generic manufacturers in recent years, with FDA inspectors repeatedly flagging them for regulatory infractions.The contract with Phlow could be \u201ca game changer that could significantly strengthen the U.S. drug supply chain and relieve many of the factors that contribute to drug shortages,\u201d said Tom Kraus, vice president of government relations for the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists.", "comment": "0 Comments", "topic": "Economy"}, {"cover": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/J7KNU3WNWUI6VGNQQQTOE3JAHM.jpghttps://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/J7KNU3WNWUI6VGNQQQTOE3JAHM.jpg", "title": "An oil spill in Russia\u2019s Arctic exposes problems in Moscow\u2019s big plans for the Far North", "date": "Jul 28, 2020", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2020/07/28/an-oil-spill-russias-arctic-exposes-problems-moscows-big-plans-far-north/", "keyword": "China and Security", "website": "the Washington Post", "author": "", "content": "", "comment": "", "topic": ""}, {"cover": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/LPO34EGBNAI6VCIINCRLT2XJ4A.jpghttps://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/LPO34EGBNAI6VCIINCRLT2XJ4A.jpg", "title": "Why Biden may follow through on a bolder agenda", "date": "Jul 28, 2020", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/07/28/why-biden-may-follow-through-bolder-agenda/", "keyword": "China and Security", "website": "the Washington Post", "author": "Katrina vanden Heuvel", "content": "With Joe Biden\u2019s polling lead growing, more attention is being paid to what he might do as president. The signals have been contradictory to say the least. After positioning himself as a resolute moderate to win delegates for the nomination, he announced that this was \u201ca real inflection in American history\u201d not unlike \u201cwhat Roosevelt [faced].\u201d When the six task forces he set up with Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) hammered out a party platform, Sanders announced that \u201cthe compromise that they came up with, if implemented, will make Biden the most progressive president since FDR.\u201d But as the New York Times\u2019s Michelle Cottle pointed out, Biden\u2019s closest advisers are veteran Democratic Party operatives from the Clinton and Obama eras, not known for original, much less radical, thinking. So, the question remains \u2014 what will Biden do?The Sanders-Biden working groups\u2019 recommendations, which will largely define the official 2020 Democratic Party Platform, are certainly bolder than anything Hillary Clinton or Barack Obama ran on. Even as Biden has consistently rejected some of Sanders\u2019s signature issues \u2014 Medicare-for-all, the Green New Deal, etc. \u2014 he\u2019s now backing a relatively far-reaching series of reforms.Support our journalism. Subscribe today.arrow-rightBiden\u2019s four-part economic program, dubbed \u201cBuild Back Better,\u201d embraces strategies that have been largely anathema to Democrats in the conservative era \u2014 public-investment-driven growth, industrial policy, fair trade and an expansion of economic rights. Though still not backing the Green New Deal, he\u2019s put forth a $1.7 trillion investment program on clean energy and energy efficiency, a $1.3 trillion Buy America program to rebuild and modernize U.S. infrastructure, and hundreds of billions of investment in education and housing each. In an economic downturn, the platform calls for subsidies to keep workers employed rather than force them into unemployment. Beyond the downturn, workers are promised a $15 minimum wage \u2014 a core Sanders demand \u2014 universal paid sick leave, stronger protections for organizing and increased minimum payments in Social Security as well as extending partial coverage to unpaid care workers.ADADOn health care, Biden now champions lowering the eligibility age for Medicare to 60, expanding Medicaid, investing in community health-care centers and providing a public option run by Medicare that even workers with insurance from their employer can buy into. On trade, the Biden-Sanders recommendations pledge no further trade accords without enforceable labor, human rights and environmental standards, a tougher stance on China, and a crackdown on tax havens and perverse incentives that reward companies for moving jobs abroad.Sign up for The Odds newsletter for election updates from data columnist David BylerTo pay for all this, Biden would raise taxes on the wealthy and corporations (largely by reversing the Trump tax breaks), increase estate taxes and tax investors at the same rates as workers. He would spend about two times as much as Clinton proposed in 2016 and levy almost three times as much in new taxes, lowering after-tax annual incomes of the top 1 percent by about 10-15 percent.Biden\u2019s platform is still a far remove from the agenda championed by Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.). And politicians find it easy to trumpet reforms that are discarded upon election. Yet there are reasons to think that Biden may well pursue a good portion of this agenda once in office.ADADFor one thing, the former vice president will take office amid the worst public health crisis in recent U.S. history and a severe recession that have exposed the human cost of our savage racial inequities, our broken health-care system, the absence of basic rights for workers and obscene inequality. Addressing these issues will require a far bolder agenda even than Obama should have adopted when taking office in the Great Recession.Equally important, political movements are demanding change. The Black Lives Matter movement against the ingrained racism of our society is mobilizing the largest demonstrations in history. The climate change movement continues to grow in intensity and sophistication. The women\u2019s uprising against Trump isn\u2019t letting up. Neither Roosevelt nor Lyndon Johnson, the greatest reform presidents in the modern era, were radical tribunes before being elected. But the combination of reality \u2014 and of political movement \u2014 provided the imperative and the pressure for systemic reforms.In addition, the Democratic policy community has dramatically shifted left. From Paul Krugman acknowledging that he and his colleagues were wrong in discounting the misery and dislocation caused by corporate-led globalization to pro-austerity voices (temporarily) hibernating in the face of the current crises, a new generation of economists is legitimizing ideas once considered verboten in establishment debates.ADADNeedless to say, there are no guarantees. Biden has neither FDR\u2019s eloquence nor his relish in taking on the \u201ceconomic royalists\u201d of his time. Biden may have his ability to work across the aisle, but he is hardly the force of nature that LBJ was in bending senators to his will. And Biden\u2019s campaign is flooded with donations from Wall Street and various corporate interests. Those who rigged the rules in their favor will fight fiercely to block reforms in a system designed to make change difficult. Systemic reform will occur only if growing mass mobilizations and forceful congressional progressives force the change. What provides hope is that the moment compels, the ideas are clear and people are on the march.Read more:Katrina vanden Heuvel: How progressive victories blow up the conventional wisdomPaul Waldman: Here\u2019s how Joe Biden\u2019s agenda becomes lawPaul Waldman: How Joe Biden is moving left while still being seen as a moderateThe Post\u2019s View: Joe Biden just released a pretty good climate plan.

The program currently covers workers who became sick as a result of the radiation hazards of their jobs and those who lived downwind of the Nevada Test Site.ADThose excluded from the program include residents downwind of the Trinity Site in New Mexico, additional downwinders in Nevada, veterans who cleaned up radioactive waste in the Marshall Islands and others.ADTina Cordova, a cancer survivor and co-founder of the Tularosa Basin Downwinders Consortium, said the excuse always has been that the federal government doesn\u2019t have enough money to take care of those affected.She said the need is even greater now since the coronavirus is disproportionately affecting those with underlying health conditions and downwinders fall into the category because of their compromised health.\u201cWhen you talk about enhancing plutonium pit production and defense spending in the trillions, you can\u2019t tell us there\u2019s not enough money to do this,\u201d she told The Associated Press. \u201cYou can\u2019t expect us to accept that any longer and that adds insult to injury.

Russia has offered to extend the nuclear arms control agreement while the Trump administration has pushed for a new pact that would also include China.While the U.S. House has adopted language that would prohibit spending to conduct or make preparations for any live nuclear weapons tests, a group of senators has included $10 million for such an effort in that chamber\u2019s version of the bill.ADThe Union of Concerned Scientists, nuclear watchdogs and environmentalists all are pushing for the funding to be eliminated.

Isolation wards are filling up.  As of Wednesday, restaurants must suspend dine-in services, masks will be mandatory \u2014 even for people exercising outdoors \u2014 and residents will be prohibited from gathering in groups of more than two, as officials impose the strictest social distancing measures here to date.ADADHeralded until recently as a model in the fight against the coronavirus, Hong Kong is emerging as a cautionary tale. Medical experts have blamed large gatherings and government exemptions that allowed certain groups to enter the city without the 14-day quarantine period and virus test mandatory for everyone else.Bars and barre return, but date night is no longer the same: Hong Kong\u2019s new normalThose exempted include airline crews, sailors, truck drivers, executives of listed companies and those granted special dispensation by the Hong Kong government \u2014 totaling more than 250,000 people between February and June, according to government data.\u201cYou had all these exempted people roaming around the city, taking taxis, contaminating taxi drivers,\u201d said Gabriel Choi Kin, president of the Hong Kong Medical Association. \u201cWe are facing this third wave partly due to poor bureaucratic management and a new, more infectious strain of the virus \u2014 so there are two problems at the same time.\u201dThe new restrictions have left businesses \u2014 especially restaurants and retail \u2014 reeling, dashing hopes that strong local demand might help them through the summer after more than a year of disruptions that began when political unrest flared last June. According to OpenRice, an online restaurant guide in Hong Kong, 1,200 restaurants closed between January and May. Many restaurant staff members had been forced to take unpaid leave, even before the latest severe restrictions related to the coronavirus and the disease it causes, covid-19.ADAD\u201cIt is hard to look at this as anything but another punch in the gut,\u201d said Syed Asim Hussain, co-founder of the Black Sheep group, which has more than 20 restaurants and 1,000 staff members. \u201cI had predicted that a third of the industry would be decimated, but this is another nail in the coffin.\u201d \u201cWe in Hong Kong sort of were the model for how to do this correctly, and it feels like we may have squandered it,\u201d he added.Six months, six countries, six families \u2014 and one unrelenting, unforgiving epidemicThe warning signs began July 5, when a restaurant cook tested positive for the virus, breaking a 21-day streak without local transmission. The number of daily confirmed infections rose steadily as the month wore on, hitting a record 145 new cases Monday. At one point in May, just over two dozen covid-19 patients were being treated in hospitals; that number has since soared to more than 1,400.ADADMany of the new cases cannot be traced to existing clusters, complicating efforts to isolate potentially infected people. \nIn the past week, cases have been linked to a slaughterhouse, a food market and homes for the elderly. Hong Kong on Monday also confirmed two new deaths from the virus, bringing its total to 22.Even before the new restrictions, restaurants had faced a temporary ban on dine-in services after 6 p.m. Many had adapted quickly by bolstering their lunch offerings or offering earlier happy hour specials \u2014 all now to little avail.Meanwhile, the beaches have been closed and playgrounds cordoned off with tape. Starting Wednesday, mask dodgers face fines of $645.\u201cI know the new restrictions will bring many inconveniences to citizens, but I hope they can be considerate. Let\u2019s grit our teeth, bite the bullet and keep going in this critical moment,\u201d said Sophia Chan, Hong Kong\u2019s secretary for food and health.Hong Kong\u2019s government would take the issue of exemptions \u201cseriously,\u201d she said, amid mounting evidence that the new wave was directly linked to this policy. Exemptions for sea crews, pilots and flight attendants will be tightened starting Wednesday, and all other people exempted from the 14-day quarantine requirement must have tested negative for covid-19 before arrival or have a test on arrival and wait for a negative result before entering the city of 7.5 million.ADADStill, worries are compounding. After China imposed a new security law this summer that sharply curtailed freedoms in Hong Kong, experts fear that officials may use the pandemic as cover to further erode political rights.Local news outlets reported Tuesday that Chief Executive Carrie Lam could postpone legislative elections scheduled for September, a vote seen as a crucial test for the pro-Beijing establishment following the passage of the draconian new law.How the U.S. can defeat coronavirus: Heed Asia\u2019s lessons from past epidemicsOn the medical front, experts are concerned about the situation in homes for the elderly, where several clusters have been traced. Choi, of the medical association, pointed to a potential shortage of negative-pressure rooms in hospitals, even though an increasing number of people are likely to need ventilators.ADFor businesses trying to avoid massive layoffs amid the highest unemployment rate here in 15 years, every day of full-scale restrictions is proving more devastating. The catering sector is calling for financial subsidies and for the government to pressure landlords to offer rent relief.ADHussain, of Black Sheep, said his group\u2019s revenue is only 5 percent of normal.

Subscribe today.arrow-rightBeijing may have been thinking it was well on its way to crushing the pro-democracy movement that arose in Hong Kong last year and persisted through months of demonstrations, despite violent police repression. If so, it was in for a surprise: Over the weekend, hundreds of thousands of Hong Kongers turned out again, this time to vote in unofficial primaries for opposition candidates in upcoming elections for the territory\u2019s legislature. The long lines of people who appeared at 240 shops and street kiosks serving as polling stations, despite official warnings that the balloting was illegal, was an inspiring show of defiance of the harsh new order China would impose.Jubilant organizers said Monday that 592,211\u00a0people had voted via apps and an additional 21,000 with paper ballots \u2014 a turnout equal to 27 percent of the vote in the last legislative elections. As organizer Benny Tai Yiu-ting told the South China Morning Post, it was as though 600,000 people had participated in a pro-democracy demonstration \u2014 which would rank it with the largest such events the city has seen.ADADAt least in theory, this one could have powerful practical consequences. The point of the primaries was to create a unified opposition slate for the September elections for the Hong Kong legislature, with the goal of capturing a majority of its 70 seats. That would allow the opposition to veto legislation, including the budget, which in turn could force the resignation of despised Hong Kong chief executive Carrie Lam.In practice, the regime of Chinese President\u00a0Xi\u00a0Jinping will probably use its muscle to tilt the elections, for example by banning many opposition candidates from the ballot. Already it is moving toward prosecuting and imprisoning key opposition leaders \u2014 from 23-year-old Joshua Wong to 82-year-old Martin Lee. The primary vote nevertheless shows that China will continue to face potent resistance in Hong Kong from people unwilling to passively surrender the rule of law, free expression and the promise of full democracy that China made when it took back the city in 1997.So far, Hong Kongers have received only limited support from Western democracies. The United States and European Union have condemned the new security law; Britain and Australia have offered asylum to Hong Kong refugees, and the United States is imposing sanctions on some officials. The Xi regime brushes off such gestures; people in Hong Kong know that the repression will likely escalate. Nevertheless, they persist.

In practice, lawyers and other experts say, it effectively extends mainland legal provisions to Hong Kong, ending the autonomy that China promised the financial center would enjoy until 2047.The new office is headed by Zheng Yanxiong, a senior Communist Party official known for quashing popular unrest on the Chinese mainland. Luo Huining, Beijing\u2019s top official in Hong Kong, has been appointed as an adviser to the agency.ADADAddressing delegates at the opening ceremony Wednesday, Luo rejected criticism of Beijing\u2019s moves.

Subscribe today.arrow-rightThe U.S. position on the margins of the conflict \u2014 complicated by uncertainty about which side Washington supports \u2014 takes on new significance as Russia, Turkey and now possibly Egypt pour weapons and fighters into a combustible battle.\u201cThe U.S. is essentially out of the game. The Libyans are unable to make their own decisions, entirely dependent on foreign actors,\u201d a Western diplomat said. \u201cThere is total drift.\u201dADLibya in recent months has become a free-for-all for regional and European powers, many of them American allies that have stepped into the security and political vacuum in support of rival governments. A divide is now also growing among NATO nations, while mercenaries from Russia, Syria and sub-Saharan Africa rush in, sensing economic opportunity.ADU.N. Secretary General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres warned that the conflict had entered a new, perilous phase as a result of \u201cunprecedented\u201d foreign military involvement. Civilian casualties have surged, and retreating fighters have planted explosives in residential areas. Now, a battle may be brewing near the city of Sirte, along Libya\u2019s coast, as each side brings heavier munitions to the fight.\u201cTime is not on our side,\u201d Guterres said early this month.ADThe situation illustrates the effects of a haphazard engagement on foreign policy matters by President Trump, who appeared to upend diplomatic efforts to strengthen a U.N.-backed government last year by declaring his support for the leader of the rival faction, would-be military ruler Khalifa Hifter.In recent weeks, Trump has called for a halt to the fighting in conversations with the leaders of Egypt, Turkey and France, as U.S. military officials have sounded the alarm over new Russian military deployments that potentially threaten U.S. naval assets in the Mediterranean.ADThe chaotic situation also draws attention to the fact that by abiding by an arms embargo, the United States may have diminished its own ability to shape Libya\u2019s future.ADEven so, the war in Libya does not figure among America\u2019s top foreign policy priorities, as the White House focuses on China, Iran and Trump\u2019s desire to curtail America\u2019s role in insurgent conflicts, all against the backdrop of the coronavirus pandemic and a looming U.S. election.\u201cUnfortunately, the U.S. is ceding its influence,\u201d said Emadeddin Badi, a Libya expert and senior fellow at the Atlantic Council. \u201cAll the states who have capitalized from the U.S. absence are now benefiting.\u201dSince it helped pull together the NATO-led operation that toppled dictator Moammar Gaddafi in 2011, the United States has limited its involvement in Libya, viewing the North African oil-producing nation largely through a counterterrorism lens and urging European nations to take the lead.ADADTo this day, many Libyans denounce the United States, unfairly or not, for not offering more help after the Arab Spring. While U.S. diplomats attempted for years to build legitimacy around the U.N.-brokered Government of National Accord, or GNA, their support has grown more cautious as it has remained weak and reliant on militia groups for protection.U.S. officials, meanwhile, have expressed exasperation with Hifter \u2014 a former military officer turned Gaddafi opponent who enjoyed CIA backing in the 1980s and 1990s \u2014 over his determination to take control by force.Hifter\u2019s 14-month military offensive to capture the capital ended in early June, months after Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan \u2014 over American objections \u2014 sent his military to defend the GNA.ADHifter\u2019s failure to take Tripoli came even after the conflict took a dramatic turn in May, when Russia covertly flew advanced fighter jets to Libya, adding to a long list of U.N. arms embargo violations and bringing major firepower in support of Hifter following the deployment of Kremlin-linked Russian mercenaries.ADRussia and Turkey appear to be motivated in part by Libya\u2019s economic promise as one of the world\u2019s largest oil producers, and its position on Europe\u2019s southern flank.Rear Adm. Heidi Berg, the top intelligence officer at U.S. Africa Command, which has taken unusual steps to publicly document Russian involvement in Libya, said Moscow was trying to position itself as a broker of peace while stoking conflict behind the scenes, as U.S. officials allege it has in Ukraine, Sudan and the Central African Republic.\u201cProxy forces .\u2009.\u2009. have previously had a seat at the negotiating table and have had undue influence on the outcome, but now have almost become the principal interlocutors,\u201d Berg said in an interview. \u201cThat highlights what Russia has wanted: international prestige and the ability to impose costs on the international community \u2014 to be the one that counts at the negotiating table.\u201dRussia also stands to gain if Egyptian President Abdel Fatah al-Sissi follows through on a threat last month to send his military into Libya if GNA forces pushed too far east. U.S. officials say Egypt, a longtime supporter of Hifter\u2019s faction, has been making military preparations for a potential intervention. On Monday, Egypt\u2019s parliament approved plans to send troops to \u201cdefend Egyptian national security in the strategic western direction.\u201dADADThe conflict has also pitted NATO nations against one another as France, which U.S. officials say supports Hifter, vows it will not tolerate Turkey\u2019s \u201cdangerous game\u201d in support of the GNA.Faced with the fast-moving battlefield maneuvers, U.S. diplomats say they have continued \u201crobust\u201d efforts, mostly behind the scenes, in support of a political settlement under a policy they characterize as \u201cactive neutrality.\u201d\u201cFirst and foremost, this is a European problem,\u201d said a senior State Department official, who like other officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.\u201cWe are invested in trying to get this solved, but this is enormously complex, the Syrianization of Libya,\u201d the official said, making reference to the war in Syria, where military missions by Iran, Russia and Turkey have added to the bloodshed.ADADAs one example of continued U.S. engagement, officials cited Secretary of State Mike Pompeo\u2019s participation this year in a Libya summit in Berlin, where several nations including Russia, France and Turkey laid out an ultimately unsuccessful cease-fire plan and called for an end to violence even as some of them were providing clandestine support to one Libyan side or the other.\u201cMany of our allies and regional partners, in addition to Russian mercenary Wagner forces, have made it very difficult,\u201d the official said, referring to a Kremlin-linked security firm called the Wagner Group. \u201cWhen we go to multilateral events and get commitments .\u2009.\u2009. from our allies and partners to respect the arms embargo and then they refuse to do so, it complicates it.\u201dMixed messages from Washington have added to the complications as White House officials, particularly under former national security adviser John Bolton, have looked more favorably on Hifter\u2019s vow to root out Islamists who have flourished in Libya\u2019s post-revolution chaos than on State Department efforts to do the same.ADADTrump appeared to sign off on Hifter\u2019s military offensive during a call in April 2019, giving the perception that the United States officially supported the strongman as Libya\u2019s legitimate leader.U.S. officials have since sought to clarify their position \u2014 in support of a political settlement rather than picking any particular side \u2014 but the damage was done.\u201cAmerica\u2019s body language continues to matter a great deal,\u201d said Jalel Harchaoui, a Libya analyst at the Clingendael Institute in The Hague.Moscow is poised to benefit if Egypt sends troops into Libya, a move that would highlight ebbing American influence over Egypt. Despite receiving $1.3\u00a0billion in U.S. aid annually, Cairo has been moving closer to Moscow, buying Russian armaments and recently cementing a nuclear power deal.Despite those threats, the Trump administration is unlikely to dramatically increase its engagement in Libya. Even in places where U.S. interests are clearer, an abiding feature of Trump\u2019s foreign policy has been his desire to reduce U.S. involvement in overseas conflicts.Another question is what Washington, even if it adopted a more activist role, could do at a stage when other nations have shown willingness to use military might.\u201cAt the end of the day, you have Russians on the ground,\u201d Badi said. \u201cSo unless you are willing to put in the effort, that\u2019s not going to change. Russia will keep getting stronger and stronger.\u201d\n\n\n\n", "comment": "470 Comments", "topic": "National Security"}, {"cover": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/J4AK3YGG7MI6VKBFQ4RAATSBKA.jpghttps://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/J4AK3YGG7MI6VKBFQ4RAATSBKA.jpg", "title": "I\u2019m a GOP governor.

Subscribe today.arrow-rightBut President Trump's plan for an executive order to shift drug and medical production to this country \u2013 by suddenly cutting off federal agencies from those offshore supply chains \u2013 could make it even harder to obtain supplies critical to combating the pandemic, such as personal protective equipment, testing supplies and even medications to treat coronavirus patients.\u00a0The order, which the administration has been working on since March, is expected to apply to government programs and agencies that directly purchase drugs and medical supplies, according to lobbyists and industry watchers. They may include the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Strategic National Stockpile and the Federal Bureau of Prisons.\u00a0The goal is to ease crippling supply chain problems that left the United States without enough tests and protective equipment.The order, led by White House trade adviser Peter Navarro, would broaden existing federal requirements for government agencies to prioritize buying supplies for medicines deemed \u201cessential\u201d from U.S. manufacturers, rather than companies in China or elsewhere around the world.\u00a0ADADAs we\u2019ve written in The Health 202, labs struggled to ramp up coronavirus testing, and hospitals and nursing homes ran short of personal protective equipment over the spring. These failures hampered the national and state responses to the pandemic, leaving the United States with far more infections and deaths than any other country. Even now, shortages of protective medical gear are looming as outbreaks grow in the South. One big reason why is because these supplies often come from other countries, which were also dealing with outbreaks.\u00a0Neither the White House nor the Department of Health and Human Services gave us details about when the order might be released or what it might contain. But HHS Secretary Alex Azar told Bloomberg Radio that the pandemic showed medical supplies are crucial for national security and suggested Trump will use executive authority to \u201cfund and incentivize domestic manufacturing\u201d for prescription drugs and personal protective equipment.\u00a0\u201cThe coronavirus pandemic brought home that core elements of our medical supply chain are just as strategic to our national security as, say, nuclear submarines and aircraft carriers are, and have to be treated with that same kind of approach,\u201d Azar said. White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows told Fox News that the executive order is among several Trump will sign this week. \u00a0But U.S. dependence on China is exactly why drugmakers and business groups aren\u2019t enthused about cutting ties during a pandemic.\u00a0The nation\u2019s pharmaceutical industry has pushed back against the potential order, arguing that the United States shouldn\u2019t shut itself off from a global supply chain.\u00a0ADAD\u201cTurning our backs on trading partners during a crisis could damage our relationships long after this pandemic ends,\u201d the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America and dozens of other business and trade groups wrote in a March letter to the administration.Other critics say that revising the government\u2019s purchasing rules won\u2019t provide a quick solution to the supply shortages of the current pandemic. \u201cMaking Buy American provisions tighter during the current crisis would likely do more harm than good,\u201d write William Reinsch and Jack Caporal of the Center for Strategic and International Studies.The U.S. relies heavily on Chinese companies for generic drugs and raw materials to make them.\u00a0Eighty percent of the nation\u2019s active pharmaceutical ingredients come from overseas \u2014 and China is its No. 2 supplier, behind only Canada.ADADWhen it comes to generic drugs, a \u201csubstantial portion\u201d of U.S. imports come either directly from China or third countries such as India, which use active ingredients sourced from China, according to a report by the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission.Moreover, U.S. dependence on China for drugs and drug products is growing. Its imports of Chinese medical equipment increased 78 percent between 2010 and 2018.The order probably would revise how a 1933 law encouraging American-made products is applied to pharmaceuticals.The Buy American Act requires federal agencies to prioritize buying products made in the United States. It works by slapping a cost penalty on bids from companies that don\u2019t meet Buy America requirements.ADBut several exemptions allow agencies to duck the requirements when it comes to buying medical supplies internationally. Under the executive order the administration is mulling, the exemptions and waivers would be pulled back for essential medicines and penalties would be broadly applied to products produced offshore.ADThe administration is still considering how to determine which medicines are essential drugs, lobbyists say. The order could direct the Department of Health and Human Services and the Defense Department to come up with a list. Or it could rely on a list of more than 400 essential medicines compiled by the World Health Organization.Ahh, oof and ouchAHH: The Trump administration has officially told the United Nations it plans to withdraw from the World Health Organization.The move could have a major impact on public health diplomacy. \u201cIt is not clear whether the president can pull the United States out of the organization and withdraw funding without Congress. When Trump first threatened to withdraw, Democratic lawmakers argued that doing so would be illegal and vowed to push back,\u201d Emily Rauhala, Karoun Demirjian and Toluse Olorunnipa report. \u201c\u2026 The decision to withdraw comes after months of criticism and threats from the U.S. president.\u201dADADThe letter sent to U.N. Secretary General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres has not yet been made public, and the United States must give a year\u2019s notice and pay any debts to the U.N. agency before an exit.\u00a0Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) criticized the decision, per C-SPAN producer Craig Caplan:House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) called the president\u2019s move \u201can act of true senselessness\u201d:\u00a0From Sen. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.):\u00a0Trump began to target the agency as coronavirus took hold in the U.S., after initially praising the WHO\u2019s handling of the crisis. He announced in April he would freeze funding to the agency amid a review of its coronavirus response.\u00a0OOF: A nursing home in Pennsylvania gave residents hydroxychloroquine, including to patients who hadn't been tested for the coronavirus.\u00a0The drug regimen worried some nurses at the Southeastern Veterans\u2019 Center in the suburbs of Philadelphia, who called the widespread and off-label use of one of the antimalarial drugs Trump touted the \u201ccovid cocktail,\u201d Debbie Cenziper and Shawn Mulcahy report.\u00a0ADADThe regimen also appeared to go against guidance from the Food and Drug Administration, which said in March that the drugs should only be used during clinical trials or in hospital settings where \u201ccareful heart monitoring\u201d is provided.\u00a0\u201cFor more than two weeks in April, a drug regimen that included hydroxychloroquine was routinely dispensed at the struggling center, often for patients who had not been tested for covid-19 and for those who suffered from medical conditions known to raise the risk of dangerous side effects, interviews, emails and medical notes and records obtained by The Washington Post show,\u201d they write.Several nursing home staff members said more than 30 residents may have received the drug. The center and the two state agencies responsible for oversight have released little information about what transpired.\u00a0ADAD\"The Department of Military and Veterans Affairs has confirmed the use of the drug but has not offered details about what led the doctors on site to decide to use it,\u201d my colleagues add. \u201cThe state Department of Health, which inspected the home on May 1 and did not cite a single deficiency in infection control or patient care, declined to say whether hydroxychloroquine was administered. The center has released no information about how patients were selected or monitored.\u201d\u00a0OUCH: Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) wouldn't explain why the state has not started reporting daily hospitalization data.The governor, who has pledged to report the data, did not respond to repeated questions about why that hasn't yet happened, the Miami Herald\u2019s Samantha Gross reports. The state is an exception among others that have regularly reported the number of currently hospitalized coronavirus patients.\u00a0\u201cMiami-Dade County Mayor Carlos Gimenez, who sat next to DeSantis at the Tuesday event, ordered hospitals in the county to report patient admissions, ICU capacity, ventilator inventory and other data every day starting on April 4,\u201d Samantha reports. \u201cThe number of people entering hospitals each day for COVID-19 is key data that public health experts monitor to measure the potential strain on hospital systems and the seriousness of the disease\u2019s resurgence.\u201d\u00a0ADADThe news conference was held indoors at the Miami Medical Center, which was turned into a coronavirus nursing facility, Samantha reports.Notably, reporters were not informed before the news conference that there were 18 patients that tested positive for coronavirus at the same facility:\u00a0Another notable moment, shared via Vox\u2019s Aaron Rupar:\u00a0Florida has emerged as the new coronavirus epicenter.\u00a0\u201cNearly 1 out of every 100 residents is infected with the virus, hospital intensive care units are full or filling up, and big-name visitors who chose Florida for their first post-isolation events are now mired in questions and controversies about safety,\u201d Cleve R. Wootson Jr., Isaac Stanley-Becker and Lori Rozsa report. \u201cAmid escalating infections, Florida, once held up by President Trump as a model for how to manage the novel coronavirus, is faring poorly.\u201dThe governor has downplayed the outbreak\u2019s growth, citing expanded testing as a reason for more positive results.\u00a0\u201cHospital leaders, lawmakers, physicians, epidemiologists, advocates and others familiar with the state\u2019s response said a false sense of security set in when grim predictions about the virus\u2019s spread in Florida did not come to pass in March and April.

Subscribe today.arrow-rightBut President Trump's plan for an executive order to shift drug and medical production to this country \u2013 by suddenly cutting off federal agencies from those offshore supply chains \u2013 could make it even harder to obtain supplies critical to combating the pandemic, such as personal protective equipment, testing supplies and even medications to treat coronavirus patients.\u00a0The order, which the administration has been working on since March, is expected to apply to government programs and agencies that directly purchase drugs and medical supplies, according to lobbyists and industry watchers. They may include the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Strategic National Stockpile and the Federal Bureau of Prisons.\u00a0The goal is to ease crippling supply chain problems that left the United States without enough tests and protective equipment.The order, led by White House trade adviser Peter Navarro, would broaden existing federal requirements for government agencies to prioritize buying supplies for medicines deemed \u201cessential\u201d from U.S. manufacturers, rather than companies in China or elsewhere around the world.\u00a0ADADAs we\u2019ve written in The Health 202, labs struggled to ramp up coronavirus testing, and hospitals and nursing homes ran short of personal protective equipment over the spring. These failures hampered the national and state responses to the pandemic, leaving the United States with far more infections and deaths than any other country. Even now, shortages of protective medical gear are looming as outbreaks grow in the South. One big reason why is because these supplies often come from other countries, which were also dealing with outbreaks.\u00a0Neither the White House nor the Department of Health and Human Services gave us details about when the order might be released or what it might contain. But HHS Secretary Alex Azar told Bloomberg Radio that the pandemic showed medical supplies are crucial for national security and suggested Trump will use executive authority to \u201cfund and incentivize domestic manufacturing\u201d for prescription drugs and personal protective equipment.\u00a0\u201cThe coronavirus pandemic brought home that core elements of our medical supply chain are just as strategic to our national security as, say, nuclear submarines and aircraft carriers are, and have to be treated with that same kind of approach,\u201d Azar said. White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows told Fox News that the executive order is among several Trump will sign this week. \u00a0But U.S. dependence on China is exactly why drugmakers and business groups aren\u2019t enthused about cutting ties during a pandemic.\u00a0The nation\u2019s pharmaceutical industry has pushed back against the potential order, arguing that the United States shouldn\u2019t shut itself off from a global supply chain.\u00a0ADAD\u201cTurning our backs on trading partners during a crisis could damage our relationships long after this pandemic ends,\u201d the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America and dozens of other business and trade groups wrote in a March letter to the administration.Other critics say that revising the government\u2019s purchasing rules won\u2019t provide a quick solution to the supply shortages of the current pandemic. \u201cMaking Buy American provisions tighter during the current crisis would likely do more harm than good,\u201d write William Reinsch and Jack Caporal of the Center for Strategic and International Studies.The U.S. relies heavily on Chinese companies for generic drugs and raw materials to make them.\u00a0Eighty percent of the nation\u2019s active pharmaceutical ingredients come from overseas \u2014 and China is its No. 2 supplier, behind only Canada.ADADWhen it comes to generic drugs, a \u201csubstantial portion\u201d of U.S. imports come either directly from China or third countries such as India, which use active ingredients sourced from China, according to a report by the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission.Moreover, U.S. dependence on China for drugs and drug products is growing. Its imports of Chinese medical equipment increased 78 percent between 2010 and 2018.The order probably would revise how a 1933 law encouraging American-made products is applied to pharmaceuticals.The Buy American Act requires federal agencies to prioritize buying products made in the United States. It works by slapping a cost penalty on bids from companies that don\u2019t meet Buy America requirements.ADBut several exemptions allow agencies to duck the requirements when it comes to buying medical supplies internationally. Under the executive order the administration is mulling, the exemptions and waivers would be pulled back for essential medicines and penalties would be broadly applied to products produced offshore.ADThe administration is still considering how to determine which medicines are essential drugs, lobbyists say. The order could direct the Department of Health and Human Services and the Defense Department to come up with a list. Or it could rely on a list of more than 400 essential medicines compiled by the World Health Organization.Ahh, oof and ouchAHH: The Trump administration has officially told the United Nations it plans to withdraw from the World Health Organization.The move could have a major impact on public health diplomacy. \u201cIt is not clear whether the president can pull the United States out of the organization and withdraw funding without Congress. When Trump first threatened to withdraw, Democratic lawmakers argued that doing so would be illegal and vowed to push back,\u201d Emily Rauhala, Karoun Demirjian and Toluse Olorunnipa report. \u201c\u2026 The decision to withdraw comes after months of criticism and threats from the U.S. president.\u201dADADThe letter sent to U.N. Secretary General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres has not yet been made public, and the United States must give a year\u2019s notice and pay any debts to the U.N. agency before an exit.\u00a0Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) criticized the decision, per C-SPAN producer Craig Caplan:House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) called the president\u2019s move \u201can act of true senselessness\u201d:\u00a0From Sen. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.):\u00a0Trump began to target the agency as coronavirus took hold in the U.S., after initially praising the WHO\u2019s handling of the crisis. He announced in April he would freeze funding to the agency amid a review of its coronavirus response.\u00a0OOF: A nursing home in Pennsylvania gave residents hydroxychloroquine, including to patients who hadn't been tested for the coronavirus.\u00a0The drug regimen worried some nurses at the Southeastern Veterans\u2019 Center in the suburbs of Philadelphia, who called the widespread and off-label use of one of the antimalarial drugs Trump touted the \u201ccovid cocktail,\u201d Debbie Cenziper and Shawn Mulcahy report.\u00a0ADADThe regimen also appeared to go against guidance from the Food and Drug Administration, which said in March that the drugs should only be used during clinical trials or in hospital settings where \u201ccareful heart monitoring\u201d is provided.\u00a0\u201cFor more than two weeks in April, a drug regimen that included hydroxychloroquine was routinely dispensed at the struggling center, often for patients who had not been tested for covid-19 and for those who suffered from medical conditions known to raise the risk of dangerous side effects, interviews, emails and medical notes and records obtained by The Washington Post show,\u201d they write.Several nursing home staff members said more than 30 residents may have received the drug. The center and the two state agencies responsible for oversight have released little information about what transpired.\u00a0ADAD\"The Department of Military and Veterans Affairs has confirmed the use of the drug but has not offered details about what led the doctors on site to decide to use it,\u201d my colleagues add. \u201cThe state Department of Health, which inspected the home on May 1 and did not cite a single deficiency in infection control or patient care, declined to say whether hydroxychloroquine was administered. The center has released no information about how patients were selected or monitored.\u201d\u00a0OUCH: Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) wouldn't explain why the state has not started reporting daily hospitalization data.The governor, who has pledged to report the data, did not respond to repeated questions about why that hasn't yet happened, the Miami Herald\u2019s Samantha Gross reports. The state is an exception among others that have regularly reported the number of currently hospitalized coronavirus patients.\u00a0\u201cMiami-Dade County Mayor Carlos Gimenez, who sat next to DeSantis at the Tuesday event, ordered hospitals in the county to report patient admissions, ICU capacity, ventilator inventory and other data every day starting on April 4,\u201d Samantha reports. \u201cThe number of people entering hospitals each day for COVID-19 is key data that public health experts monitor to measure the potential strain on hospital systems and the seriousness of the disease\u2019s resurgence.\u201d\u00a0ADADThe news conference was held indoors at the Miami Medical Center, which was turned into a coronavirus nursing facility, Samantha reports.Notably, reporters were not informed before the news conference that there were 18 patients that tested positive for coronavirus at the same facility:\u00a0Another notable moment, shared via Vox\u2019s Aaron Rupar:\u00a0Florida has emerged as the new coronavirus epicenter.\u00a0\u201cNearly 1 out of every 100 residents is infected with the virus, hospital intensive care units are full or filling up, and big-name visitors who chose Florida for their first post-isolation events are now mired in questions and controversies about safety,\u201d Cleve R. Wootson Jr., Isaac Stanley-Becker and Lori Rozsa report. \u201cAmid escalating infections, Florida, once held up by President Trump as a model for how to manage the novel coronavirus, is faring poorly.\u201dThe governor has downplayed the outbreak\u2019s growth, citing expanded testing as a reason for more positive results.\u00a0\u201cHospital leaders, lawmakers, physicians, epidemiologists, advocates and others familiar with the state\u2019s response said a false sense of security set in when grim predictions about the virus\u2019s spread in Florida did not come to pass in March and April. DeSantis declared victory, attending a laudatory news conference at the White House with President Trump,\u201d Cleve, Isaac and Lori write.\u00a0\u201c\u2026 But observers maintain the state then failed to prepare for a surge of the virus, which struck as residents were seeking refuge in air-conditioned indoor spaces, where the virus is believed to be most easily transmitted.\u201d\u00a0Coronavirus latestAnd here are a few more good stories to catch up on this morning:\u00a0Around the world:\u00a0Sweden has allowed life to carry on mostly unrestricted during the pandemic, which led to thousands more deaths than in nearby countries and has not much spared its economy.

But earlier this summer, customers received a very different message in their inboxes.\u00a0Support our journalism. Subscribe today.arrow-right\u201cA Note from Customer Service: There are fraudulent ads on Facebook and Instagram offering fake discounts on Patagonia products. It's a credit card scam,\" the emails said.\u00a0The mass warning reflected a larger struggle over a major surge in fake ads over the past two years on Facebook \u2013 affecting not just Patagonia but other large companies like Microsoft and Ralph Lauren.In the case of Patagonia, fraudsters leveraged the social network's powerful advertising tools to target people with fake promotions for Patagonia products, and then directing them to other websites that siphoned their credit card details or sold them a counterfeit version of a popular Patagonia product.\u00a0ADADBetween February and July, Patagonia says it received more than 1,500 reports of fake Facebook ads for its products. In that same time period, the company submitted 236 reports to Facebook about problematic ads, sometimes containing up to two dozen examples.The company has also seen massive spikes in ads around major shopping days, such as Black Friday right after Thanksgiving.\u00a0Rob Tadlock, Patagonia's associate general counsel, told me the company is constantly hunting for these ads, which requires a major investment from its legal and customer service teams. Patagonia has been asking Facebook for help to address the problem since November 2018, and Tadlock told me the social network hasn't done enough to address the issue.\u00a0AD\u201cWe have really not been able to get them to partner with us in a way that allows us to meaningfully address this issue that's a growing challenge for our customers,\u201d he said.\u00a0The ads can result in major financial damage for customers, as well as challenges for brands whose consumers think they're receiving below quality products if they don't realize the goods they receive are counterfeit.\u00a0Patagonia isn't the only company confronting Facebook ad scams.\u00a0More than 70 consumer and apparel brands, ranging from HP to the The North Face, have been impacted by fraudulent ads on Facebook and its subsidiary Instagram since 2017, according to a new report that will be published later today from the Transnational Alliance to Combat Illicit Trade. The group is pressuring on tech giants and policymakers to do more to stamp out online fraud.\u00a0ADADJeff Hardy, director general of the alliance, said shoppers have a certain comfort level when they're perusing well-known social networks, and might not be on the lookout for counterfeit ads. He compared online shopping to the experience of going to a well-known grocery chain and not expecting the fruit there to be rotten.\u201cThere's an inherent responsibility, especially in this day and age, to make sure that when people walk through your doors that they have a safe shopping experience,\u201d he said.The ad fraud challenge is particularly acute during the pandemic, as widespread stay-at-home orders and store closures prompted a surge in e-commerce. There are also many legitimate markdowns and sales as retailers adjust to an economy transformed by the coronavirus, and it can be difficult for consumers to distinguish between legitimate sales and offers that are too good to be true.\u00a0It's also a critical moment for Facebook.\u00a0Facebook has seen major brands \u2013 including Patagonia and Unilever \u2013 pause ad spending on its platform in protest of its handling of hate speech. The company's size and power is under the microscope as Washington and state regulators escalate their scrutiny of Silicon Valley. Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg is scheduled to testify in a congressional hearing on Monday focused on antitrust issues in the tech industry with the chief executives of Amazon, Google and Apple. (Amazon chief executive Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)ADADSocial networks are also under greater pressure to take responsibility for the content shared on their services, whether that's criminal activity or misinformation about elections. Hardy says the ad fraud issues are another facet of that larger debate.\u00a0\u201cWe think the fraudulent ad issue should be addressed along with the other issues currently being raised \u2013 all generated by the evolution of the platforms and the growth in consumer usage and trust in the powerful brands,\u201d Hardy said. \u201cThese issues are being raised in a discussion about what is the platform\u2019s responsibility and how can we raise consumer awareness.\u201dCounterfeits and online fraud aren't new problems.\u00a0The report notes fraudulent advertising isn't just limited to Facebook, saying it's also been an issue on other social networks including Google's YouTube and other popular websites. The activity is the latest sign that fraudsters are trying to stay a step ahead of regulation and other controls.ADAD\u201cThe scam of using fraudulent advertising is a new gateway to an old problem,\u201d said Hardy.\u00a0There's increasingly been a push to crack down on online counterfeits and credit card fraud in Washington. The Trump administration and lawmakers have \u00a0raised concerns about the proliferation of counterfeit goods for sale on Amazon's platform, a topic that could come up at next week's antitrust hearing.\u00a0Hardy says most of the proposed legislation so far doesn't specifically tackle the issue of digital advertising. He hopes lawmakers will do more to address the issue.\u00a0Meanwhile, companies are putting pressure on the platforms to do more.\u00a0The alliance's report calls for tech companies to adopt tighter controls to ensure advertisers are legitimate, such as collecting more data about a business or proof of business registration. They group calls for all advertisements to be reviewed before they're published online by algorithms and people. It also wants improved tools and forums for customers to share reports of ad fraud with the companies.\u00a0ADADFacebook says it has created tools to help companies report fraudulent content, but advertisers tell me they don't go far enough. Facebook also publishes its response to counterfeit goods in its transparency report.\u00a0\u201cWe prohibit people from posting content that violates someone else\u2019s intellectual property rights and review ads and commerce listings before they go live to make sure they comply with our policies,\u201d said Facebook spokesman Andy Stone. \"We have created multiple tools to help brands find and report potentially violating content and we take aggressive action to stop repeat violators, including disabling accounts.\"Our top tabsJoe Biden's campaign is criticizing the new election information labels Facebook rolled out this week.Facebook yesterday appended a new label to posts from both President Trump and Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, Rachel Lerman reports. The company started last week to apply the label, which links to the federal government's website about absentee voting, to all posts from candidates running for federal office.ADADFacebook added the label to one of Trump's posts making misleading claims suggesting mail-in voting would lead to a rigged election. However, Facebook says the label will be applied to all posts regardless of their veracity.\u00a0\u201cMail-In Voting, unless changed by the courts, will lead to the most CORRUPT ELECTION in our Nation\u2019s History! #RIGGEDELECTION,\u201d Trump posted early Tuesday morning. \u00a0Biden's post, which read \u201cWe have to vote Donald Trump out this November\u201d and featured an image of a tweet with the same, language, solicited donations.Biden spokesman Bill Russo criticized the company for giving the posts the same treatment:Facebook said it will remove posts that suppress voting in the days ahead of the election.\u00a0ADRoger McNamee, author of \u201cZucked: Waking Up to the Facebook Catastrophe\" warned the label could give the posts greater credibility:\u00a0Twitter, which added fact-check labels to previous Trump tweets accusing mail-in ballots of being fraudulent, did not label the post, citing its policy to not taken actions against \u201cbroad, nonspecific statements.\"\u00a0Twitter is cracking down on QAnon conspiracy accounts due to an uptick in coordinated harassment.Twitter has banned 7,000 related accounts and will limit content from approximately 150,000 others from circulating, my colleague Tim Elfrink reports.\u00a0ADIt's one of the most aggressive enforcement actions by a social media platform against followers of the right-wing conspiracy theory. QAnon followers allege that \"deep state\" actors seek to undermine Trump and that high profile celebrities and Democrats are involved in child sex trafficking. \u00a0The FBI warned last year that QAnon will likely drive \u201cboth groups and individual extremists to carry out criminal or violent acts.\u201d\u00a0An increase in coordinated attacks by QAnon accounts on individuals, sometimes called \u201cbrigading,\u201d also led Twitter to determine the accounts violated its harassment policies:But as Joan Donovan, research director at the Shorenstein Center, points out, the content is still easily accessible on Facebook and YouTube:The content is also still on TikTok, Ben and Brandy write.Facebook is creating new teams to study racial bias on its platforms.\u00a0It's a reversal from the company's prior stance limiting research into disparate racial impacts on the platform, Deepa Seetharaman and Jeff Horwitz report at The Wall Street Journal report.\u00a0ADInstagram's new \"equity and inclusion team\" will examine how the company's algorithms affect black, Hispanic and other minority users compared to white users. Facebook is creating a similar team, Instagram confirmed. Both teams will consult with outside experts and civil-rights groups on how to conduct the research.Facebook is facing pressure from advertisers to better address hate speech and other offensive content on its platform.Users of both Facebook and Instagram have accused the company of disproportionately removing or censoring posts by users of color. But because Facebook does not explicitly track race, critics have struggled to prove their allegations.An internal analysis last year found that Instagram users whose activities suggested they were black were 50 percent more likely to have their account disabled under changes considered by the company. The officials tweaked the changes but no further research was conducted.\u00a0Apple, Facebook and Google scaled-down lobbying during the pandemic.\u00a0Overall combined lobbying for the top five tech companies fell four percent.\u00a0Amazon, meanwhile, increased its lobbying by one percent up to $4.4 million in the second quarter, Lauren Feiner at CNBC reports. \u00a0Microsoft significantly increased its lobbying expenditures by 22 percent to a total of $2.9 million last quarter. That's more than the individual expenditures of Google ($1.7 million) and Apple ($1.5 million). Microsoft, which is the only of the top five not slated to testify in front of Congress over antitrust concerns on Monday, lobbied on issues including the EARN IT Act, a bill that critics warn could endanger encryption.\u00a0Meanwhile, TikTok's parent company ByteDance more than doubled its spending to $500,000 in the last quarter. The company has beefed up its presence in D.C. as the president and some lawmakers now threaten to ban the app. They worry that TikTok could threaten national security by handing over the data of U.S. users to the Chinese government \u2013 something that TikTok says it has not been asked to do and would not do.The company also announced plans to add 10,000 jobs in the U.S. over the next three years, Axios reports.Lyft also increased spending to a record $530,000 during the pandemic. The company has lobbied for benefits for independent contractors as it faces lawsuits in both California and Massachusetts alleging it should provide its workers with employee benefits.Rant and raveTwitter found a new contender for most oblivious startup:At least the copywriters didn't completely upsell it:Many critics pointed out the business model risked pushing out Bay Area residents who can already barely afford to live in trailers:And it would require rural Internet to actually work:Tl;drInside the industryIndustry group TechNet slammed two controversial White House immigration policies.The group's president and chief Linda Moore blasted a White House memo that would bar undocumented immigrants from being counted in the part of the census that determines seats in the U.S. House\u201cExcluding undocumented immigrants from the apportionment count emanating from the Census only hurts our country\u2019s ability to respond to the needs of those who live here and contribute to our communities,\" Moore said in a statement.Members of the D.C.-based trade organization include Amazon, Apple, Google, Lyft, Oracle and Uber.TechNet also joined a lawsuit filed yesterday led by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce seeking an injunction on the president's June order banning the entry of several nonimmigrant visa categories for six months.

But BGI\u2019s efforts to sell testing supplies in a state now facing a new surge of infections underscores a dilemma the United States will face again and again as China\u2019s ambitious technology companies gain prominence globally: Under what circumstances should U.S. officials and businesses engage with the Chinese tech sector?ADADBob Kocher, a physician and venture capital executive who volunteers on the state\u2019s coronavirus-testing task force, said in an interview that BGI\u2019s pitching raised red flags for him. For one, he was worried about relying on a Chinese company for critical medical supplies, given U.S.-China tensions. He was also concerned that allowing a China-headquartered entity to equip U.S. laboratories for coronavirus testing or other future purposes could give China access to sensitive patient data.Kocher said his concern was sparked in part by a brief and inconclusive U.S. intelligence report cautioning that CGI \u201cmay be vulnerable to Chinese influence.\u201d He added, however, that he has seen no evidence of data breaches involving BGI or CGI, and BGI wholly rejected the idea.Kocher discussed the matter with another of the state\u2019s unpaid coronavirus advisers, D.J. Patil, a health-care-technology executive who previously served as the Obama administration\u2019s chief data scientist. In an interview, Patil said he raised a different concern \u2014 that giving BGI a bigger role in U.S. laboratories could strengthen China in the fast-growing and ethically sensitive fields of biotechnology and genetic science \u2014 sectors the United States hopes to continue leading.ADADKocher in early April advised California\u2019s health secretary, Mark Ghaly, to steer clear of BGI supplies, saying the state had better options, and the health secretary agreed, said Kocher, a partner at Venrock, a venture-capital fund that previously owned a stake in BGI rival Illumina and currently owns part of a company aiming to compete in a field where BGI is also present.Patil said he advised testing task force members to tread carefully and consider the long-term ramifications of using BGI supplies.Ghaly didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment. \u201cThe state has evaluated multiple testing options in its efforts to significantly expand the availability of covid-19 tests and makes decisions based on which testing platforms best meet the needs of California and its diverse residents,\" said Ali Bay, a spokeswoman for the California Department of Public Health.BGI called security concerns about its technology \u201cnot valid\u201d and lacking in any evidence.Inside America\u2019s mask crunch: A slow government reaction and an industry wary of liability\u201cThe testing system that we deploy in the U.S. makes it impossible for us to have access to patient data,\u201d Jeremy Nickolenko, an American who heads global commercial partnerships from BGI\u2019s U.S. offices, said in an interview. \u201cWe can provide the gear, but it\u2019s a U.S. laboratory that\u2019s actually running the assay and getting the results, and they deal with the data, as they should, per regulation.\u201dADAD\u201cWe are a significant testing and technology company with a global footprint, and we can actually make a very significant impact in the midst of a pretty terrible pandemic,\u201d Nickolenko added. BGI declined to make its leadership in China available for interviews.Other countries have welcomed BGI to set up high-speed testing labs, including Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. And testing centers in Sweden and Kansas \u2014 and in California\u2019s Santa Clara County, despite the state\u2019s cold shoulder \u2014 have purchased supplies from the company, saying they didn\u2019t fear data breaches.Santa Clara officials took the security concerns into account before buying one piece of equipment but are \u201c100 percent confident that no private information would be made available to the company,\" said deputy county executive David Campos.\u2018Dilemma\u2019 over Chinese techChina is spending billions on high-tech development, aiming to dominate technologies that will shape the future of business and defense. Those ambitions have concerned not only the Trump administration and Congress but also U.S. business leaders such as former Google chief executive Eric Schmidt, who have warned that the United States cannot afford to cede critical innovation to China.ADADTension has already come to a head over Chinese telecom giant Huawei, the world\u2019s largest provider of mobile network gear \u2014 a field from which U.S. companies are largely absent. The United States calls Huawei a security risk, which the company denies, and has undertaken an international lobbying campaign, with mixed results, to persuade other countries not to buy from Huawei.The Trump administration has targeted other Chinese companies, restricting trade with more than a dozen it accuses of supplying surveillance gear in the western province of Xinjiang, where U.S. officials and human rights groups say China\u2019s ruling Communist Party is holding Muslims in mass detention camps.And the United States has blocked Chinese investors from buying U.S. technology companies deemed strategic to economic growth or national security. Last year, the Trump administration forced a Chinese company founded by BGI\u2019s former chief executive to sell its majority stake in a U.S. health-care-data company, PatientsLikeMe.ADADAt the same time, Chinese companies, often backed by significant government financing that critics say can sometimes represent an unfair subsidy, are cranking out a slew of high-tech products. Their growing output, including industrial drones, electric buses and more, makes Chinese tech harder to avoid or contain.Trump administration exempts face masks and medical gowns from import tariffs as coronavirus spreads\u201cOne and a half billion people are going to come up with a lot of cool stuff,\u201d said Rod Hunter, a trade lawyer at Baker McKenzie and a former national security official in the George W. Bush administration. \u201cIf it\u2019s something with the potential to save human lives, are we going to say we don\u2019t want it? For U.S. policymakers, it\u2019s going to be a tough choice.\u201dV.J. Sahi, a partner at the corporate advisory firm Clark Street Associates, who was hired by BGI\u2019s U.S. subsidiary to pitch state officials, said the campaign hasn\u2019t borne much fruit. \u201cCandidly, we haven\u2019t had a lot of success. There is a lot of xenophobia,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cSome people have been direct with us and said, \u2018No, because it\u2019s from China.\u2019\u201dADADCalifornia is doing a better job providing coronavirus testing than many U.S. states are, but it lags behind the most highly regarded countries and has reported some \u201cworrying signs\u201d in recent days, according to Jennifer Nuzzo, lead epidemiologist for the Johns Hopkins Covid-19 Testing Insights Initiative.A low rate of positive tests is a sign of a strong testing program. About 4 to 5 percent of tests in California have come back positive in recent weeks, though that number is now rising toward 6 percent \u2014 better than Arizona\u2019s 23 percent but worse than South Korea\u2019s rate of under 2 percent, Nuzzo said.\u201cThere are some worrying signs in California. Positivity and case numbers are ticking up,\u201d Nuzzo said. \u201cI think measures the governor is taking to address increasing case growth is important.\u201dADADThe state\u2019s public health department says it is making progress. \u201cCalifornia\u2019s testing capacity continues to increase dramatically \u2014 scaling up from just 2,000 per day in April\u201d to about 100,000 a day now, the department said in a statement.Sensitive workBGI, based in the southern tech hub of Shenzhen, is well known in the fields of genetic research and medical diagnostics. Its co-founder and chairman, Wang Jian, is a prominent geneticist who spent six years as a research fellow in the United States during the 1980s and 1990s.The company\u2019s coronavirus-related products enable a standard form of testing that extracts genetic material known as RNA from nasal swab samples, then determines whether it matches the genetics of the novel coronavirus.ADA separate BGI business is more closely tied to the future of biotech: selling DNA-sequencing machines and services. The machines, which resemble photocopiers, are like fancy digital cameras that scan DNA molecules to decode the full genetic makeup of people, animals and other organisms.ADThe genetic maps, or genomes, the machines generate are a hot commodity as researchers worldwide attempt to decipher the genetic underpinnings of life and disease, with the hope of finding new medicines or crops.BGI has some prominent supporters in U.S. academia, including George Church, the Harvard geneticist who has served on the Chinese company\u2019s scientific advisory board since 2007. In 2017, BGI established the George Church Institute of Regenesis, a research collaboration between Church\u2019s lab and about a dozen staffers at BGI in China.As cases surge, lines for coronavirus tests sometimes stretch miles in the summer heatThe group is attempting to synthesize organisms from human-made DNA, among other projects, Church said in an interview. Church also has a business relationship with BGI: Consumers who want their genomes decoded can send saliva samples to a company he co-founded, Nebula Genomics, which sends them to BGI labs in Hong Kong for sequencing.Harris Lewin, a professor of evolution and ecology at University of California at Davis, has worked with BGI through the Earth Biogenome Project, an international consortium aiming to sequence many of the planet\u2019s species. \u201cThey\u2019ve honored all their commitments to the organization,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ve been good partners.\u201dSome of BGI\u2019s activities have drawn scrutiny, however. Over the past year, a unit of BGI has sold Chinese police the supplies they needed to collect and analyze DNA from millions of men and boys who have no serious criminal history, according to a recent report by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, which called the collection a violation of human rights and a disturbing extension of China\u2019s efforts to \u201cmanage and control society.\u201dThe BGI subsidiary Forensic Genomics International is one of two dozen Chinese companies that have supplied testing kits or other materials to the project, along with the U.S. company Thermo Fisher, according to the study, which analyzed government purchase orders. The New York Times earlier reported details of the project.Emile Dirks, an author of the report and a PhD candidate at the University of Toronto, said the men and boys being targeted \u201creally have no capacity to refuse\u201d to give a blood sample and are often located in rural or semi-rural communities where public scrutiny of the collection is less likely. He said the purchase orders make reference to this police-led collection program, suggesting that companies \u201care aware on some level what is being done with their technology.\u201dIn a written statement addressing the report, BGI said it \u201cdoes not condone and would never be involved in any human-rights abuses.\u201dThe company \u201chas a long track record in applying strict ethical standards and protection of data privacy and security,\" added the statement, which was provided by Matthew Ballard, senior vice president of the public relations firm BCW Global.American researchers who have interacted with Wang, BGI\u2019s chairman, call him a talented scientist who has at times stirred controversy. One pointed to remarks Wang made at a 2018 panel discussion where he said that employees of BGI, which sells prenatal tests, are \u201cnot allowed\u201d to have babies with birth defects.\"If there is a birth defect, it is a humiliation for all 7,000 of our employees. It would mean we are swindling the public,\u201d he said, in remarks reported by the Chinese publication Sixth Tone and captured on video.Asked about the comments, BGI said \u201cthere are no such company rules.\u201dCoronavirus offersBGI was founded as the nonprofit Beijing Genomics Institute in 1999, to participate in the Human Genome Project, the international consortium that mapped the first human genome. It relocated to Shenzhen in 2007. In late 2009, it received a $1.5 billion line of credit from the state-run China Development Bank, after which it purchased 128 DNA sequencers from California-based Illumina, the U.S. company announced. At the time, it was Illumina\u2019s largest-ever order.Three years later, BGI and Illumina found themselves on opposite sides in a bidding war to acquire Complete Genomics, a California-based company whose acquisition gave BGI access to the sequencing technology it now sells. During that fight, BGI complained that Illumina was raising unfair national security concerns about it, but the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS, reviewed the deal for national security risks and cleared it.Still, the one-page U.S. intelligence report reviewed by Kocher and Patil, dated April 10, said BGI\u2019s U.S. subsidiary \u201cmay be vulnerable to Chinese influence\" via its parent company, which the report said had \u201cmultiple connections to Chinese state government,\u201d including the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Ministry of Science and Technology.\"Chinese influence over CGI could provide China with access to the sensitive medical data of patients who use its medical testing,\u201d said the unclassified report from the Department of the Air Force Office of Special Investigations, which The Washington Post reviewed. It did not elaborate on this risk.More coronavirus tests are coming back positive, contrary to what Trump and the House Republican leader claimThe Air Force declined to comment on BGI or on the specifics of the document, but said in a statement provided by spokeswoman Linda Card: \u201cA foreign organization that may incidentally gain access to the protected health information (PHI) of current or future U.S. Government personnel through community-based medical testing services, may present an increased opportunity for third-party, foreign intelligence entities to access and exploit that data.\u201dIt added: \u201cThe reports that we produce for senior leaders and decision makers are sometimes drawn from publicly available information and placed in a single document to help inform.\u201dAsked about the report, BGI said it \u201ctakes all aspects of data protection, privacy and ethics extremely seriously\u201d and has \u201cno access to patient data\u201d via coronavirus testing. It added that BGI is not \u201cowned or funded by the Chinese government.\u201dMonths of expertise BGI\u2019s expertise in the current health crisis dates to late December, when the company determined that the covid-19 illness appearing in Wuhan, China, was caused by a novel coronavirus, according to Chinese media outlet Caixin.On Jan. 25, two days after China locked down Wuhan, Wang led a team to the city to set up testing, according to the company, which later opened similar \u201cFire Eye\u201d labs in Shenzhen, Beijing and other cities.By the end of March, BGI and China were promoting the testing gear all over the world. After a phone call between Chinese President Xi Jinping and Saudi King Salman, Saudi Arabia hired the company to establish six testing labs and provide 500 Chinese testing specialists, according to the Saudi Press Agency. In the United Arab Emirates, BGI and a local cloud computing company, Group 42, jointly opened a testing lab in late March, the Chinese company said.As the United States struggled to ramp up testing, offers of BGI supplies arrived at all levels of California government.\u201cWe propose to establish the world\u2019s largest COVID-19 testing facility through a public private partnership,\" said an April 5 proposal that BGI\u2019s U.S. subsidiary sent state officials, the mayor of San Jose and task force members, including Kocher. \u201cBy working with the state\u2019s existing CLIA testing labs, this operation could be running tests in less than 2 weeks,\u201d it added.BGI executive Nickolenko said the company\u2019s mention of CLIA labs, which are federally regulated, shows it was expecting California to be fully in charge of any testing operation.When these Boston doctors ran out of virus-testing swabs, they mobilized an army of 3-D printersA second proposal from BGI\u2019s partner in the United Arab Emirates, Group 42, struck Patil and Kocher as more concerning. It said Group 42 and BGI were ready to build two labs on a nonprofit basis and initially operate them.\u201cG42 and BGI will build, and initially for up to a 30-day period operate, and then transfer two Fire Eye Laboratories \u2026 to the State of California,\u201d read the March 23 proposal, sent to Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) by Group 42 Chief Executive Peng Xiao.\u201cG42 and BGI will provide the equipment, installation, validation and test protocols and train local staff in California to operate the labs,\" it said.\u201cWe will only recover from you our actual cost of setting up these two laboratories, which we estimate to be approximately $10,000,000. We will provide the necessary technical personnel to build the labs and train the operational personnel,\u201d said the proposal, which even offered to advance California money to help it cover costs.Patil said he was suspicious of the offer to construct the labs at cost and to advance California money. \u201cWhat\u2019s the catch here?\u201d he asked in an interview.In an emailed statement, G42 said it was \u201cprepared to absorb upfront costs in exchange for a long-term commitment from California to buy testing kits and supplies for the laboratory facility.\"BGI said: \u201cG42 initiated contact with California on behalf of our partnership in the UAE as a possible way to help.\" Nickolenko said he didn\u2019t sign off on the proposal, and that BGI\u2019s U.S. unit has never proposed operating California labs.Newsom\u2019s administration declined to comment on the letter.U.S. market toeholdPatil said he was also concerned that allowing BGI into U.S. labs could give it market access that the United States would later regret. The country and China are competing to develop industries around DNA sequencing and genomics, he said, including \u201cprecision-medicine\u201d ventures to deliver treatments tailored to a patient\u2019s genetic profile. Why should the United States help a Chinese company establish its equipment and services in that field, he asked?\u201cWhat China has really been trying to do is try to get to a place where they can own the entire supply chain for genomic testing,\u201d Patil said. \u201cThis is a toehold that they build on.\u201dHe added that there are risks to helping China lead a new industry facing so many ethical quandaries. \u201cChina is not transparent with their use of technology, and they are using technology in many cases to oppress groups. Do you want them setting the standards?\u201d he asked.BGI said it \u201cpays particular attention to complying with scientific ethics and personal privacy protection at all times.\u201dThe quantum revolution is coming, and Chinese scientists are at the forefrontKocher said he feared patients\u2019 personal data could leak back to China if California labs opened up to BGI equipment or personnel.In the case of coronavirus testing, that could include information on the sample test tubes, such as a patient\u2019s name, date of birth or the name of their doctor, he said. While this data is sometimes hidden behind a bar code, labs decode the bar codes to submit bills to insurance companies, so the data can exist in lab information systems, Kocher said.Nickolenko said BGI would have \u201cabsolutely no access\u201d to data flowing through the laboratory information system.Lars Engstrand, a microbiologist who is overseeing a coronavirus-testing lab at Sweden\u2019s Karolinska Institute that is using BGI equipment, was skeptical that any personal data could leak out, saying he didn\u2019t see any way to obtain patient information protected behind the bar codes on the samples he sees.Santa Clara County, the home of Silicon Valley and site of the earliest-known coronavirus deaths in the United States, said its officials considered privacy concerns before buying BGI test materials but were confident they could use the supplies in a secure fashion.The county purchased test kits and a piece of equipment that automates the extraction of RNA from the nasal-swab samples, said Campos, the county official.\u201cIt is a stand-alone piece of equipment. It is not connected to any computer in our system,\u201d Campos said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have any patient information,\u201d he added.The instrument will allow the county to perform more tests per minute than other vendors\u2019 equipment would, which was the county\u2019s priority, he said.Lewin, the University of California professor, said he would like to see BGI products available in the U.S., to boost levels of coronavirus testing. \u201cAny competition that increases testing capacity, drives down costs and improves quality is good,\u201d he said.Eva Dou and Ruth Eglash contributed to this report.", "comment": "0 Comments", "topic": "Business"}, {"cover": "", "title": "Judge blocks Georgia\u2019s \u2018heartbeat\u2019 abortion law", "date": "Jul 13, 2020", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/judge-blocks-georgias-heartbeat-abortion-law/2020/07/13/ac33735c-c31e-11ea-b4f6-cb39cd8940fb_story.html", "keyword": "China and Security", "website": "the Washington Post", "author": "", "content": "GEORGIAJudge voids 'heartbeat' abortion restrictionsSupport our journalism.

Jones had temporarily blocked the law in October, and it never went into effect. The new ruling permanently enjoins the state from ever enforcing House Bill 481.Georgia\u2019s measure sought to ban abortions once a \u201cdetectable human heartbeat\u201d was present, with some limited exceptions. Cardiac activity can be detected by ultrasound as early as six weeks into a pregnancy, before many women realize they\u2019re pregnant, according to a legal challenge. The bill narrowly passed the Georgia General Assembly amid intense lobbying for and against.ADADGov. Brian Kemp (R), who has supported the restriction, immediately vowed an appeal.The prospects of an appeal are uncertain, though, considering the U.S. Supreme Court last month struck down other abortion restrictions in a case from Louisiana.Women in Georgia can currently seek an abortion during the first 20 weeks of a pregnancy.Both the state and those challenging the law asked Jones to rule without a trial, saying there were no disputed facts. Jones granted the challengers\u2019 motions for summary judgment and denied the state\u2019s motions, finding the law violated the 14th Amendment.Jones refused to leave any parts of the law in effect, which would have also granted personhood to a fetus, giving it the same legal rights as people have after they\u2019re born. For example, a mother could have claimed a fetus as a dependent to reduce taxes.ADADAt least eight states passed so-called heartbeat bills in 2019, including Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Kentucky, Mississippi, Missouri, Ohio and Tennessee.In a separate ruling Monday, a U.S. district judge in Tennessee blocked a state law that Gov.

Subscribe today.arrow-rightSince then, the evidence supporting that theory has only increased.In a special congressional election in New York\u2019s 27th District held late last month, Republican Chris Jacobs held a 40-point lead after votes were tallied on primary day. As tens of thousands of absentee ballots have been added to the count, though, Jacobs\u2019s edge has shrunk to 12 points, according to the Associated Press\u2019s latest results. The Democrat in the race, Nathan McMurray, has picked up 36,000 votes since primary day, while Jacobs has added just 22,000.ADADJacobs has already won the contest to replace Rep. Chris Collins (R-N.Y.), who resigned before pleading guilty to insider trading. But this was the congressional seat in which Trump performed the best among all 27 New York districts in 2016 \u2014 he carried it by 25 points \u2014 and it looks as though the GOP might manage to hold on to it by only single digits. That\u2019s not exactly a great omen.Thus far, this is the only federal special election since the vote-by-mail debate really kicked off amid the novel coronavirus pandemic. But it presages what could be a rough fall for Republicans as the president repeatedly rails against the alleged dangers \u2014 unsubstantiated \u2014 posed by mail-in votes while trying to make a distinction without a difference between them and absentee ballots, which he himself has used to vote in Florida.\u00a0The mail-in ballot issue is on the front burner because of the pandemic, which is spreading dangerously throughout the country and may or may not be worse in November. Some voters and poll workers, especially older ones, may be concerned about showing up physically to the polls, where the virus can spread more easily, on Election Day.The New York results mirror absentee ballot applications, polls and results in other states that have voted recently.\u00a0We don't yet have good data about absentee voting from runoffs last night in Alabama \u2014 where Trump nemesis Jeff Sessions lost to Tommy Tuberville in the GOP primary \u2014 and Texas, or in the Maine primary to face Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine). (Sara Gideon won.)ADADNew CBS News-YouGov polls this week in three battleground states Trump won in 2016 \u2014 Arizona, Florida and Texas \u2014 showed significant Democratic advantages among people who were planning to vote by mail. In Arizona, 80 percent of Democrats said they planned to vote by mail, while just 47 percent of Republicans said the same. In Florida, it was 56 percent to 28 percent, respectively. And in Texas, it was 39 percent to 15 percent.It\u2019s not unusual for Democrats to have an advantage in voting by mail, but not to this extent. And the CBS polls reinforced that.The polls also asked not just how people plan to vote this year but also how they usually cast their ballots. In Arizona, the number of Democrats who usually vote by mail was 64 percent, but it increased to 80 percent for those who plan to do so in this election. In Florida, 38 percent said they usually vote by mail, compared with 58 percent this time. And in Texas, the number jumped from 11 percent usually to 39 percent in 2020.ADADThe GOP, by contrast, saw no such increases in plans to vote by mail, and interestingly, the polls suggest some GOP voters might be less likely to vote by mail this time. In Arizona, while 51 percent of Republicans said they usually vote by mail, the number dropped to 47 percent when it came to people\u2019s plans for this year. In Florida, the number was 29 percent generally but 28 percent for this election. There was a slight uptick in interest in voting by mail among Texas Republicans, from 5 percent usually to 15 percent today, but nothing like the increase on the Democratic side.It\u2019s important to note that people may misrepresent their voting history or their plans for voting in 2020. But it\u2019s clear that, according to the voters themselves in key states, this has become a yawning gap.And that gap was confirmed this week by GOP pollster Glen Bolger, who said his polling of an undetermined swing state showed an even bigger chasm.\u201cYikes -- just finished a statewide survey in a swing state,\u201d Bolger tweeted Monday. \u201cThe quarter of the voters who plan to vote by mail or absentee break 15% Trump/75% Biden on the Pres. ballot. Republicans are skeptical about voting by mail, and that's a problem up and down ballot.\u201dADADPractically speaking, it\u2019s not clear how that might pan out in actual elections. But New York\u2019s special contest isn\u2019t the only recent example of Democratic mail-in voting surging in a way the GOP isn't matching.In Oklahoma\u2019s June 30 primary, for example, Democratic absentee votes increased from 4,400 in a 2014 Senate primary to 12,400 in the 2018 gubernatorial primary to nearly 57,000 in this year\u2019s Senate primary. That\u2019s nearly 13 times the number of absentee votes compared with the last time the same Senate seat was up six years ago.The GOP has also seen an increase, but of nowhere near this magnitude. It went from 8,900 absentee votes in 2014 to 15,300 in 2018 and 33,800 today \u2014 about four times the total from the previous primary for the same Senate seat six years ago.ADIn total, absentee votes accounted for 3 percent of total votes in each party\u2019s primaries in both 2014 and 2018. But in 2020, absentees accounted for 21 percent of Democratic votes, compared with 9 percent of GOP votes.ADThese numbers echo the gaps in primary absentee ballot requests that were detailed last week by Gardner and Dawsey in states like Georgia, Kentucky and Virginia. And the same dynamic is at play in Florida, where the GOP previously held an edge in absentee votes \u2014 including in 2016 \u2014 but where Democrats now have a sizable edge, 1.6 million to 1.2 million.The question is how much this all matters in November \u2014 both in the presidential race and congressional contests.\u00a0Republicans who are less concerned than Bolger have argued Democrats are merely cannibalizing voters who would otherwise just turn out to vote in person. Particularly in states that have robust early voting, the partisan mix of absentee votes is perhaps less of a concern. And data have suggested that voting by mail doesn\u2019t necessarily give one side or another a measurable edge.ADADThat said, this election provides an unprecedented X-factor: the coronavirus. If the outbreak looms into November in key states, turning out to vote in person may not be as attractive, and banking votes via mail-in ballots may prove more important. That said, Republicans are generally less concerned about the virus than Democrats, and they might be willing to turn out to vote in person in a way Democrats won\u2019t.Either way, the debate speaks to the importance of Democrats banking as many mail-in votes as they can, which virtually all signs suggest they are doing in a way Republicans aren\u2019t.What\u2019s clear is that it\u2019s a dynamic well worth watching \u2014 and one that is clearly worrying plenty of Republicans.More on the electionsSessions lost the GOP runoff election in Alabama to football coach Tuberville.\u00a0Just five years ago, Sessions, then a senator from Alabama, became the first Republican senator to endorse Trump\u2019s presidential campaign. \u201cThat once remarkable bond came to a crashing end Tuesday night when the Associated Press declared that Tuberville had defeated Sessions in the runoff to be the Republican nominee in November\u2019s Senate race against Sen. Doug Jones (D-Ala.). The result culminated four months of Trump imploring Alabama\u2019s voters to reject Sessions, the man who the president once said he leaned on for advice in forming his \u2018America First\u2019 agenda,\u201d Paul Kane and Toluse Olorunnipa report. \u201cRunning for his old Senate seat \u2014 which he abandoned in early 2017 to become Trump\u2019s attorney general \u2014 Sessions endured one brutal insult after another from the president. \u2026\u00a0ADAD\u201cTrump chose not to rub too much salt into Sessions\u2019s wounds Tuesday night, but he quickly hailed Tuberville\u2019s victory. \u2018Tommy Tuberville WON big against Jeff Sessions. Will be a GREAT Senator for the incredible people of Alabama,\u2019 Trump tweeted. \u2026 [Tuberville\u2019s] victory was declared quickly \u2014 a final humiliation for Sessions, who was once so untouchable that Alabama Democrats didn\u2019t field an opponent against him in his 2014 reelection. \u2026 Emerging from casting his own ballot Tuesday morning, Sessions made one final, almost sad, assertion that he would be a Trump purist if he won his old seat back, noting that several staunch conservatives had overcome the president\u2019s endorsement of other candidates in recent weeks.\u201d\u00a0Air Force veteran MJ Hegar will challenge Sen. John Cornyn (R-Tex.) in November.\u00a0\u201cHegar, whose biography helped her nearly win a congressional seat in 2018, was long considered the favorite, but a late charge from state Sen. Royce West forced outside groups backing Hegar to pour money into the race to get her over the finish line,\u201d Paul Kane and Colby Itkowitz report. \u201cAlso in Texas, former White House physician Ronny L. Jackson won the nomination to replace Rep. Mac Thornberry (R) in one of the most conservative districts in the nation. \u2026 Pete Sessions, who had been in the House for 22 years before losing in the Democratic wave of 2018, won the chance to compete to return to Congress. Rather than run for his old seat in the suburbs of Dallas, Sessions moved 100 miles south to run in a more conservative district. He failed to win the primary outright, facing Renee Swann, a political outsider who was backed by the district\u2019s current congressman, retiring Rep. Bill Flores (R), in Tuesday\u2019s runoff. The Republican runoff to replace retiring Rep. Will Hurd (R) in a Texas district Democrats believe is within reach was still too close to call.\u201d\u00a0ADADIn Maine, state House Speaker Gideon won the Democratic primary and will face Collins. Millions of dollars have already poured into that race, both to the Democrat\u2019s coffers and from outside groups eager to oust Collins.\u00a0Republican Rep. Steve Watkins of Kansas was charged with three felonies in connection to a voter fraud investigation.\u00a0\u201cWatkins was charged with three felony counts in Shawnee County, Kan., late Tuesday, nearly eight months after a newspaper investigation found that he listed the location of a UPS Store as his address for voting purposes on government forms,\u201d Elise Viebeck and David Weigel report. \u201cWatkins, a freshman Republican from Topeka, faces two felony charges related to unlawful voting and one related to interference with law enforcement and providing false information, according to a news release from Shawnee County District Attorney Michael F. Kagay. The charges stem from a 2019 local election, the release stated. The case emerged after an investigation of a\u00a0Topeka Capital-Journal report\u00a0from December, which stated that Watkins may have committed felony voter fraud by allegedly misstating his address on a voter change-of-residency form. \u2026 With just three weeks until his primary, Watkins shrugged off the announcement Tuesday, calling the errors an innocent mistake and saying he looks forward to \u2018setting the record straight.\u2019 \u2018This is clearly hyper-political,\u2019 he said during a televised debate that began shortly after news broke about the charges. \u2018I haven\u2019t done anything wrong.\u2019\u201dTrump used an event at the Rose Garden for an extended campaign-like attack on Joe Biden.\u00a0\u201cTrump lambasted Biden\u2019s record on Beijing, casting [him] as soft on China during its rise to become the second-largest economy in the world. He faulted Biden for initially opposing his administration\u2019s decision to shut down some flights from China over the coronavirus, and he inaccurately stated that Biden \u2018sided with China\u2019 on its handling of the pandemic \u2014 even though Biden had sounded alarms months ago as Trump was still praising Chinese President Xi Jinping. \u2026 Trump didn\u2019t stop there, adding an attack on Biden\u2019s son Hunter,\u201d David Nakamura, Toluse Olorunnipa and Philip Rucker report.\u201cTrump dumped almost an hour\u2019s worth of opposition research against his Democratic rival with less than four months to go before the election, hitting him over immigration, energy policy and the environment. \u2018There\u2019s probably never been a time when candidates are so different,\u2019 Trump said. \u2026 The president said he had asked some of his \u2018people\u2019 for a list of Biden\u2019s platform issues before proceeding to read out several liberal policy proposals. The list mirrored a lengthy Twitter thread posted last week by Trump\u2019s son Donald Trump Jr., in which he described the \u2018Biden-Sanders\u2019 agenda as \u2018insane.\u2019 Much of Trump\u2019s summary of Biden\u2019s policy proposals was false or misleading.\u201dThe Rose Garden event was meant to mark Trump\u2019s signing of a bill to punish China over Hong Kong.\u00a0\u201cThe bill Trump signed, which unanimously passed Congress last week, imposes sanctions on China over its ongoing crackdown on Hong Kong, where officials have imposed a sweeping national security law that allows Beijing to target political opponents in the once-autonomous city. Under the new standard, Hong Kongers who are deemed guilty of \u2018subversion\u2019 face a possible life sentence in prison \u2014 the same as political dissidents in mainland China,\u201d Colby Itkowitz reports. \u201cTrump also issued an executive order ending the United States\u2019 longtime preferential treatment of Hong Kong, saying it would now be treated the same as mainland China with regard to economic and other issues.'Meanwhile, Biden shared a new $2 trillion climate plan.\u00a0\u201cThe plan would significantly reduce the United States\u2019 reliance on fossil fuels, and the 15-year timeline for a 100 percent clean electricity standard is far more ambitious than anything Biden has previously proposed. It was Biden\u2019s latest attempt to channel the liberal energy in his party, as well as a response to calls for sweeping plans to lift a struggling economy. The blueprint was quickly hailed by environmentalists and liberals as a big step forward in the climate effort, and just as quickly denounced by Republicans as an unwieldy plan that would raise energy costs,\u201d Matt Viser and Dino Grandoni report. \u201cThe Trump campaign was quick to go after Biden\u2019s proposal Tuesday. \u2018His plan is more like a socialist manifesto that promises to massively raise taxes, eliminate jobs in the coal, oil or natural gas industries, and crush the middle class,\u2019 said Hogan Gidley, the campaign\u2019s national press secretary.\u201d\u00a0The coronavirusThe global surge in coronavirus cases is being fed by the developing world \u2014 and the U.S., with its 3,410,000 cases.\u00a0\u201cPoorer nations throughout Latin America, the Middle East, South Asia and Africa are bearing a growing share of the caseload, even as wealthier countries in Western Europe and East Asia enjoy a relative respite after having beaten back the worst effects through rigorously enforced lockdowns. And then there\u2019s the United States, which leads the world in new cases and, as with many nations that possess far fewer resources, has shown no sign of being able to regain control,\u201d Griff Witte, Mary Beth Sheridan, Joanna Slater and Liz Sly report. \u201cThe severity of the toll on the United States was evident in new infection figures released Tuesday, with multiple states \u2014 including Oklahoma and Nevada \u2014 hitting record highs. Florida has now reported more cases in the past week \u2014 nearly 78,000 \u2014 than most European nations have in their entire struggle with covid-19, the illness caused by the novel coronavirus.\u00a0\u201cThat sort of explosive growth is mirrored in other nations, though none with the sort of wealth, infrastructure and scientific know-how of the United States. Across much of the developing world, rampant coronavirus outbreaks came relatively late. But now that the virus has taken root, governments are flailing in their attempts to halt it and citizens are resisting changes to their way of life. \u2026 The struggle has been especially fraught in Latin America, where countries have been lashed by covid-19\u2019s ferocity and many have not yet hit their peaks. Brazil has the second-highest number of covid-19 deaths in the world, at more than 74,000, while Mexico has the fourth-highest, with more than 37,000. (The United States, with at least 133,000 deaths, is far and away the global leader.)\u201dStarting today, a new data reporting protocol for hospitals will eliminate the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as a recipient of state coronavirus data. The administration is instead encouraging governors to use the National Guard to collect this data, Lena Sun and Amy Goldstein report. The move leaves health-care institutions to report information daily to a federal contractor or to their state, which would coordinate the federal reporting. Public experts say bypassing the CDC could harm the quality of data and the federal response to the pandemic.\u00a0The first vaccine tested in the U.S. boosted people\u2019s immune systems just the way scientists hoped it would.\u00a0\u201c\u2018No matter how you slice this, this is good news,\u2019 [said] Anthony Fauci,\u201d the AP reports. \u201cThe experimental vaccine, developed by Fauci\u2019s colleagues at the National Institutes of Health and Moderna Inc., will start its most important step around July 27: A 30,000-person study to prove if the shots really are strong enough to protect against the coronavirus. But Tuesday, researchers reported anxiously awaited findings from the first 45 volunteers who rolled up their sleeves back in March. Sure enough, the vaccine provided a hoped-for immune boost. Those early volunteers developed what are called neutralizing antibodies in their bloodstream \u2014 molecules key to blocking infection \u2014 at levels comparable to those found in people who survived COVID-19, the research team reported in the New England Journal of Medicine.\u201d\u00a0White House trade adviser Peter Navarro attacked Fauci in an op-ed for USA Today, part of a continuing campaign against the doctor by Trump and his allies.\u00a0\u201cDr. Anthony Fauci has a good bedside manner with the public, but he has been wrong about everything I have interacted with him on,\u201d Navarro wrote. \u201cSo when you ask me whether I listen to Dr. Fauci\u2019s advice, my answer is: only with skepticism and caution.\u201dIn response to White House attacks, Fauci said the public can trust him.\u00a0\u201cI believe, for the most part, you can trust respected medical authorities,\u201d Fauci said during a Georgetown Institute of Politics and Public Service event. \u201cI believe I\u2019m one of them, so I think you can trust me.\u201dFormer Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman Joseph Dunford Jr. won\u2019t chair a coronavirus spending panel. Dunford Jr. removed himself from consideration to chair the Congressional Oversight Commission, a key mechanism created by Congress that is supposed to scrutinize coronavirus spending, Erica Werner reports. The reasons for his withdrawal were unclear, but the decision is a major setback for the commission and efforts to find someone to lead it. Under the coronavirus stimulus legislation, the chair of the bipartisan five-member commission must be appointed jointly by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.). \u00a0Quote of the day\u201cWe don\u2019t want CDC guidance to be a reason why people don\u2019t reopen their schools,\u201d said Vice President Pence during a roundtable discussion at Louisiana State University, where he emphasized the Trump administration\u2019s position that schools at all levels need to open this fall. (Des Bieler)\u00a0The Trump administration backed off a plan that would\u2019ve required international students to take face-to-face classes.\u00a0\u201cThe abrupt reversal, disclosed in a federal court in Boston, came a little more than a week after U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement issued an edict that stunned U.S. higher education leaders and students worldwide,\u201d Nick Anderson and Susan Svrluga report. \u201cUnder the July 6 policy from ICE, international students enrolled in U.S. colleges and universities for the fall semester faced a mandate to take at least one course in person. Those students, ICE said, \u2018may not take a full online course load and remain in the United States.\u2019 That mandate posed a major obstacle to plans for online teaching and learning that colleges are developing in response to the novel coronavirus pandemic. In the spring, the federal government had given schools much more leeway to teach international students online. Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology had sued to block the new policy. In a hearing in that case on Tuesday, held before U.S. District Judge Allison D. Burroughs, the judge announced that the schools and the federal government had reached an agreement that made the lawsuit moot.\u201d\u00a0A new White House ad campaign tells 18 million unemployed workers that maybe they just have to \u201cFind Something New.\u201d\u00a0\u201cIvanka Trump urged out-of-work Americans to \u2018find something new\u2019 Tuesday as part of a new jobs initiative designed to tout the benefits of skills training and career paths that don\u2019t require a college degree. But the effort \u2014 complete with a website, advertising campaign and virtual roundtable featuring Apple CEO Tim Cook and IBM chair Ginni Rometty \u2014 was swiftly derided on social media as \u2018clueless\u2019 and \u2018tone-deaf\u2019 given the pandemic, recession and Trump\u2019s own familial employment history,\u201d Hamza Shaban reports. \u201cThe nation currently has 5.4 million job openings, according to the Labor Department, which is not nearly enough for the roughly 18 million Americans who are officially unemployed and the 33 million who are currently receiving unemployment benefits. Many saw the campaign as insensitive given the suffering of Americans whose livelihoods disappeared as the pandemic forced companies to shutter or sharply curtail operations. And for many, Ivanka Trump \u2014 the daughter of a billionaire and a multimillionaire in her own right \u2014 is the wrong person to speak to the challenges of finding a job.\u201dFaulty data collection has raised questions about the administration\u2019s Paycheck Protection Program claims.\u00a0\u201cA Post analysis of data on 4.9 million loans released last week by the Small Business Administration shows that many companies are reported to have \u2018retained\u2019 far more workers than they employ. Likewise, in some cases the agency\u2019s jobs claim for entire industries surpasses the total number of workers in those sectors. And for more than 875,000 borrowers, the data shows that zero jobs were supported or no information is listed at all, according to the analysis,\u201d Jonathan O\u2019Connell, Emma Brown, Steven Rich and Aaron Gregg report. \u201cThe flaws raise questions about the claims by the Trump administration that 51 million jobs were \u2018supported\u2019 by the [PPP].\u201dThe federal stockpile is thinning out amid the case surge.\u201cThe federal government may not have the capacity to supply medical professionals with personal protective equipment amid the latest surge in coronavirus cases, according to internal administration documents,\u201d NBC News reports. \u201cFor example, the Strategic National Stockpile and the Federal Emergency Management Agency have fewer than 900,000 gloves in reserve after shipping 82.7 million of them \u2014 or just 30 percent of the amount requested by state, local and tribal governments \u2014 since the COVID-19 crisis began. \u2026 Nonetheless, Adm. John Polowczyk, the chief supply-chain official for the White House coronavirus task force, maintained in an interview with NBC News on Tuesday that the supply situation is \u2018just not that dire.\u2019\u201dTexas hospitals are running out of drugs, beds, ventilators and staff.

Subscribe today.arrow-rightSince then, the evidence supporting that theory has only increased.In a special congressional election in New York\u2019s 27th District held late last month, Republican Chris Jacobs held a 40-point lead after votes were tallied on primary day. As tens of thousands of absentee ballots have been added to the count, though, Jacobs\u2019s edge has shrunk to 12 points, according to the Associated Press\u2019s latest results. The Democrat in the race, Nathan McMurray, has picked up 36,000 votes since primary day, while Jacobs has added just 22,000.ADADJacobs has already won the contest to replace Rep. Chris Collins (R-N.Y.), who resigned before pleading guilty to insider trading. But this was the congressional seat in which Trump performed the best among all 27 New York districts in 2016 \u2014 he carried it by 25 points \u2014 and it looks as though the GOP might manage to hold on to it by only single digits. That\u2019s not exactly a great omen.Thus far, this is the only federal special election since the vote-by-mail debate really kicked off amid the novel coronavirus pandemic. But it presages what could be a rough fall for Republicans as the president repeatedly rails against the alleged dangers \u2014 unsubstantiated \u2014 posed by mail-in votes while trying to make a distinction without a difference between them and absentee ballots, which he himself has used to vote in Florida.\u00a0The mail-in ballot issue is on the front burner because of the pandemic, which is spreading dangerously throughout the country and may or may not be worse in November. Some voters and poll workers, especially older ones, may be concerned about showing up physically to the polls, where the virus can spread more easily, on Election Day.The New York results mirror absentee ballot applications, polls and results in other states that have voted recently.\u00a0We don't yet have good data about absentee voting from runoffs last night in Alabama \u2014 where Trump nemesis Jeff Sessions lost to Tommy Tuberville in the GOP primary \u2014 and Texas, or in the Maine primary to face Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine). (Sara Gideon won.)ADADNew CBS News-YouGov polls this week in three battleground states Trump won in 2016 \u2014 Arizona, Florida and Texas \u2014 showed significant Democratic advantages among people who were planning to vote by mail. In Arizona, 80 percent of Democrats said they planned to vote by mail, while just 47 percent of Republicans said the same. In Florida, it was 56 percent to 28 percent, respectively. And in Texas, it was 39 percent to 15 percent.It\u2019s not unusual for Democrats to have an advantage in voting by mail, but not to this extent. And the CBS polls reinforced that.The polls also asked not just how people plan to vote this year but also how they usually cast their ballots. In Arizona, the number of Democrats who usually vote by mail was 64 percent, but it increased to 80 percent for those who plan to do so in this election. In Florida, 38 percent said they usually vote by mail, compared with 58 percent this time. And in Texas, the number jumped from 11 percent usually to 39 percent in 2020.ADADThe GOP, by contrast, saw no such increases in plans to vote by mail, and interestingly, the polls suggest some GOP voters might be less likely to vote by mail this time. In Arizona, while 51 percent of Republicans said they usually vote by mail, the number dropped to 47 percent when it came to people\u2019s plans for this year. In Florida, the number was 29 percent generally but 28 percent for this election. There was a slight uptick in interest in voting by mail among Texas Republicans, from 5 percent usually to 15 percent today, but nothing like the increase on the Democratic side.It\u2019s important to note that people may misrepresent their voting history or their plans for voting in 2020. But it\u2019s clear that, according to the voters themselves in key states, this has become a yawning gap.And that gap was confirmed this week by GOP pollster Glen Bolger, who said his polling of an undetermined swing state showed an even bigger chasm.\u201cYikes -- just finished a statewide survey in a swing state,\u201d Bolger tweeted Monday. \u201cThe quarter of the voters who plan to vote by mail or absentee break 15% Trump/75% Biden on the Pres. ballot. Republicans are skeptical about voting by mail, and that's a problem up and down ballot.\u201dADADPractically speaking, it\u2019s not clear how that might pan out in actual elections. But New York\u2019s special contest isn\u2019t the only recent example of Democratic mail-in voting surging in a way the GOP isn't matching.In Oklahoma\u2019s June 30 primary, for example, Democratic absentee votes increased from 4,400 in a 2014 Senate primary to 12,400 in the 2018 gubernatorial primary to nearly 57,000 in this year\u2019s Senate primary. That\u2019s nearly 13 times the number of absentee votes compared with the last time the same Senate seat was up six years ago.The GOP has also seen an increase, but of nowhere near this magnitude. It went from 8,900 absentee votes in 2014 to 15,300 in 2018 and 33,800 today \u2014 about four times the total from the previous primary for the same Senate seat six years ago.ADIn total, absentee votes accounted for 3 percent of total votes in each party\u2019s primaries in both 2014 and 2018. But in 2020, absentees accounted for 21 percent of Democratic votes, compared with 9 percent of GOP votes.ADThese numbers echo the gaps in primary absentee ballot requests that were detailed last week by Gardner and Dawsey in states like Georgia, Kentucky and Virginia. And the same dynamic is at play in Florida, where the GOP previously held an edge in absentee votes \u2014 including in 2016 \u2014 but where Democrats now have a sizable edge, 1.6 million to 1.2 million.The question is how much this all matters in November \u2014 both in the presidential race and congressional contests.\u00a0Republicans who are less concerned than Bolger have argued Democrats are merely cannibalizing voters who would otherwise just turn out to vote in person. Particularly in states that have robust early voting, the partisan mix of absentee votes is perhaps less of a concern. And data have suggested that voting by mail doesn\u2019t necessarily give one side or another a measurable edge.ADADThat said, this election provides an unprecedented X-factor: the coronavirus. If the outbreak looms into November in key states, turning out to vote in person may not be as attractive, and banking votes via mail-in ballots may prove more important. That said, Republicans are generally less concerned about the virus than Democrats, and they might be willing to turn out to vote in person in a way Democrats won\u2019t.Either way, the debate speaks to the importance of Democrats banking as many mail-in votes as they can, which virtually all signs suggest they are doing in a way Republicans aren\u2019t.What\u2019s clear is that it\u2019s a dynamic well worth watching \u2014 and one that is clearly worrying plenty of Republicans.More on the electionsSessions lost the GOP runoff election in Alabama to football coach Tuberville.\u00a0Just five years ago, Sessions, then a senator from Alabama, became the first Republican senator to endorse Trump\u2019s presidential campaign. \u201cThat once remarkable bond came to a crashing end Tuesday night when the Associated Press declared that Tuberville had defeated Sessions in the runoff to be the Republican nominee in November\u2019s Senate race against Sen. Doug Jones (D-Ala.). The result culminated four months of Trump imploring Alabama\u2019s voters to reject Sessions, the man who the president once said he leaned on for advice in forming his \u2018America First\u2019 agenda,\u201d Paul Kane and Toluse Olorunnipa report. \u201cRunning for his old Senate seat \u2014 which he abandoned in early 2017 to become Trump\u2019s attorney general \u2014 Sessions endured one brutal insult after another from the president. \u2026\u00a0ADAD\u201cTrump chose not to rub too much salt into Sessions\u2019s wounds Tuesday night, but he quickly hailed Tuberville\u2019s victory. \u2018Tommy Tuberville WON big against Jeff Sessions. Will be a GREAT Senator for the incredible people of Alabama,\u2019 Trump tweeted. \u2026 [Tuberville\u2019s] victory was declared quickly \u2014 a final humiliation for Sessions, who was once so untouchable that Alabama Democrats didn\u2019t field an opponent against him in his 2014 reelection. \u2026 Emerging from casting his own ballot Tuesday morning, Sessions made one final, almost sad, assertion that he would be a Trump purist if he won his old seat back, noting that several staunch conservatives had overcome the president\u2019s endorsement of other candidates in recent weeks.\u201d\u00a0Air Force veteran MJ Hegar will challenge Sen. John Cornyn (R-Tex.) in November.\u00a0\u201cHegar, whose biography helped her nearly win a congressional seat in 2018, was long considered the favorite, but a late charge from state Sen. Royce West forced outside groups backing Hegar to pour money into the race to get her over the finish line,\u201d Paul Kane and Colby Itkowitz report. \u201cAlso in Texas, former White House physician Ronny L. Jackson won the nomination to replace Rep. Mac Thornberry (R) in one of the most conservative districts in the nation. \u2026 Pete Sessions, who had been in the House for 22 years before losing in the Democratic wave of 2018, won the chance to compete to return to Congress. Rather than run for his old seat in the suburbs of Dallas, Sessions moved 100 miles south to run in a more conservative district. He failed to win the primary outright, facing Renee Swann, a political outsider who was backed by the district\u2019s current congressman, retiring Rep. Bill Flores (R), in Tuesday\u2019s runoff. The Republican runoff to replace retiring Rep. Will Hurd (R) in a Texas district Democrats believe is within reach was still too close to call.\u201d\u00a0ADADIn Maine, state House Speaker Gideon won the Democratic primary and will face Collins. Millions of dollars have already poured into that race, both to the Democrat\u2019s coffers and from outside groups eager to oust Collins.\u00a0Republican Rep. Steve Watkins of Kansas was charged with three felonies in connection to a voter fraud investigation.\u00a0\u201cWatkins was charged with three felony counts in Shawnee County, Kan., late Tuesday, nearly eight months after a newspaper investigation found that he listed the location of a UPS Store as his address for voting purposes on government forms,\u201d Elise Viebeck and David Weigel report. \u201cWatkins, a freshman Republican from Topeka, faces two felony charges related to unlawful voting and one related to interference with law enforcement and providing false information, according to a news release from Shawnee County District Attorney Michael F. Kagay. The charges stem from a 2019 local election, the release stated. The case emerged after an investigation of a\u00a0Topeka Capital-Journal report\u00a0from December, which stated that Watkins may have committed felony voter fraud by allegedly misstating his address on a voter change-of-residency form. \u2026 With just three weeks until his primary, Watkins shrugged off the announcement Tuesday, calling the errors an innocent mistake and saying he looks forward to \u2018setting the record straight.\u2019 \u2018This is clearly hyper-political,\u2019 he said during a televised debate that began shortly after news broke about the charges. \u2018I haven\u2019t done anything wrong.\u2019\u201dTrump used an event at the Rose Garden for an extended campaign-like attack on Joe Biden.\u00a0\u201cTrump lambasted Biden\u2019s record on Beijing, casting [him] as soft on China during its rise to become the second-largest economy in the world. He faulted Biden for initially opposing his administration\u2019s decision to shut down some flights from China over the coronavirus, and he inaccurately stated that Biden \u2018sided with China\u2019 on its handling of the pandemic \u2014 even though Biden had sounded alarms months ago as Trump was still praising Chinese President Xi Jinping. \u2026 Trump didn\u2019t stop there, adding an attack on Biden\u2019s son Hunter,\u201d David Nakamura, Toluse Olorunnipa and Philip Rucker report.\u201cTrump dumped almost an hour\u2019s worth of opposition research against his Democratic rival with less than four months to go before the election, hitting him over immigration, energy policy and the environment. \u2018There\u2019s probably never been a time when candidates are so different,\u2019 Trump said. \u2026 The president said he had asked some of his \u2018people\u2019 for a list of Biden\u2019s platform issues before proceeding to read out several liberal policy proposals. The list mirrored a lengthy Twitter thread posted last week by Trump\u2019s son Donald Trump Jr., in which he described the \u2018Biden-Sanders\u2019 agenda as \u2018insane.\u2019 Much of Trump\u2019s summary of Biden\u2019s policy proposals was false or misleading.\u201dThe Rose Garden event was meant to mark Trump\u2019s signing of a bill to punish China over Hong Kong.\u00a0\u201cThe bill Trump signed, which unanimously passed Congress last week, imposes sanctions on China over its ongoing crackdown on Hong Kong, where officials have imposed a sweeping national security law that allows Beijing to target political opponents in the once-autonomous city. Under the new standard, Hong Kongers who are deemed guilty of \u2018subversion\u2019 face a possible life sentence in prison \u2014 the same as political dissidents in mainland China,\u201d Colby Itkowitz reports. \u201cTrump also issued an executive order ending the United States\u2019 longtime preferential treatment of Hong Kong, saying it would now be treated the same as mainland China with regard to economic and other issues.'Meanwhile, Biden shared a new $2 trillion climate plan.\u00a0\u201cThe plan would significantly reduce the United States\u2019 reliance on fossil fuels, and the 15-year timeline for a 100 percent clean electricity standard is far more ambitious than anything Biden has previously proposed. It was Biden\u2019s latest attempt to channel the liberal energy in his party, as well as a response to calls for sweeping plans to lift a struggling economy. The blueprint was quickly hailed by environmentalists and liberals as a big step forward in the climate effort, and just as quickly denounced by Republicans as an unwieldy plan that would raise energy costs,\u201d Matt Viser and Dino Grandoni report. \u201cThe Trump campaign was quick to go after Biden\u2019s proposal Tuesday. \u2018His plan is more like a socialist manifesto that promises to massively raise taxes, eliminate jobs in the coal, oil or natural gas industries, and crush the middle class,\u2019 said Hogan Gidley, the campaign\u2019s national press secretary.\u201d\u00a0The coronavirusThe global surge in coronavirus cases is being fed by the developing world \u2014 and the U.S., with its 3,410,000 cases.\u00a0\u201cPoorer nations throughout Latin America, the Middle East, South Asia and Africa are bearing a growing share of the caseload, even as wealthier countries in Western Europe and East Asia enjoy a relative respite after having beaten back the worst effects through rigorously enforced lockdowns. And then there\u2019s the United States, which leads the world in new cases and, as with many nations that possess far fewer resources, has shown no sign of being able to regain control,\u201d Griff Witte, Mary Beth Sheridan, Joanna Slater and Liz Sly report. \u201cThe severity of the toll on the United States was evident in new infection figures released Tuesday, with multiple states \u2014 including Oklahoma and Nevada \u2014 hitting record highs. Florida has now reported more cases in the past week \u2014 nearly 78,000 \u2014 than most European nations have in their entire struggle with covid-19, the illness caused by the novel coronavirus.\u00a0\u201cThat sort of explosive growth is mirrored in other nations, though none with the sort of wealth, infrastructure and scientific know-how of the United States. Across much of the developing world, rampant coronavirus outbreaks came relatively late. But now that the virus has taken root, governments are flailing in their attempts to halt it and citizens are resisting changes to their way of life. \u2026 The struggle has been especially fraught in Latin America, where countries have been lashed by covid-19\u2019s ferocity and many have not yet hit their peaks. Brazil has the second-highest number of covid-19 deaths in the world, at more than 74,000, while Mexico has the fourth-highest, with more than 37,000. (The United States, with at least 133,000 deaths, is far and away the global leader.)\u201dStarting today, a new data reporting protocol for hospitals will eliminate the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as a recipient of state coronavirus data. The administration is instead encouraging governors to use the National Guard to collect this data, Lena Sun and Amy Goldstein report. The move leaves health-care institutions to report information daily to a federal contractor or to their state, which would coordinate the federal reporting. Public experts say bypassing the CDC could harm the quality of data and the federal response to the pandemic.\u00a0The first vaccine tested in the U.S. boosted people\u2019s immune systems just the way scientists hoped it would.\u00a0\u201c\u2018No matter how you slice this, this is good news,\u2019 [said] Anthony Fauci,\u201d the AP reports. \u201cThe experimental vaccine, developed by Fauci\u2019s colleagues at the National Institutes of Health and Moderna Inc., will start its most important step around July 27: A 30,000-person study to prove if the shots really are strong enough to protect against the coronavirus. But Tuesday, researchers reported anxiously awaited findings from the first 45 volunteers who rolled up their sleeves back in March. Sure enough, the vaccine provided a hoped-for immune boost. Those early volunteers developed what are called neutralizing antibodies in their bloodstream \u2014 molecules key to blocking infection \u2014 at levels comparable to those found in people who survived COVID-19, the research team reported in the New England Journal of Medicine.\u201d\u00a0White House trade adviser Peter Navarro attacked Fauci in an op-ed for USA Today, part of a continuing campaign against the doctor by Trump and his allies.\u00a0\u201cDr. Anthony Fauci has a good bedside manner with the public, but he has been wrong about everything I have interacted with him on,\u201d Navarro wrote. \u201cSo when you ask me whether I listen to Dr. Fauci\u2019s advice, my answer is: only with skepticism and caution.\u201dIn response to White House attacks, Fauci said the public can trust him.\u00a0\u201cI believe, for the most part, you can trust respected medical authorities,\u201d Fauci said during a Georgetown Institute of Politics and Public Service event. \u201cI believe I\u2019m one of them, so I think you can trust me.\u201dFormer Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman Joseph Dunford Jr. won\u2019t chair a coronavirus spending panel. Dunford Jr. removed himself from consideration to chair the Congressional Oversight Commission, a key mechanism created by Congress that is supposed to scrutinize coronavirus spending, Erica Werner reports. The reasons for his withdrawal were unclear, but the decision is a major setback for the commission and efforts to find someone to lead it. Under the coronavirus stimulus legislation, the chair of the bipartisan five-member commission must be appointed jointly by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.). \u00a0Quote of the day\u201cWe don\u2019t want CDC guidance to be a reason why people don\u2019t reopen their schools,\u201d said Vice President Pence during a roundtable discussion at Louisiana State University, where he emphasized the Trump administration\u2019s position that schools at all levels need to open this fall. (Des Bieler)\u00a0The Trump administration backed off a plan that would\u2019ve required international students to take face-to-face classes.\u00a0\u201cThe abrupt reversal, disclosed in a federal court in Boston, came a little more than a week after U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement issued an edict that stunned U.S. higher education leaders and students worldwide,\u201d Nick Anderson and Susan Svrluga report. \u201cUnder the July 6 policy from ICE, international students enrolled in U.S. colleges and universities for the fall semester faced a mandate to take at least one course in person. Those students, ICE said, \u2018may not take a full online course load and remain in the United States.\u2019 That mandate posed a major obstacle to plans for online teaching and learning that colleges are developing in response to the novel coronavirus pandemic. In the spring, the federal government had given schools much more leeway to teach international students online. Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology had sued to block the new policy. In a hearing in that case on Tuesday, held before U.S. District Judge Allison D. Burroughs, the judge announced that the schools and the federal government had reached an agreement that made the lawsuit moot.\u201d\u00a0A new White House ad campaign tells 18 million unemployed workers that maybe they just have to \u201cFind Something New.\u201d\u00a0\u201cIvanka Trump urged out-of-work Americans to \u2018find something new\u2019 Tuesday as part of a new jobs initiative designed to tout the benefits of skills training and career paths that don\u2019t require a college degree. But the effort \u2014 complete with a website, advertising campaign and virtual roundtable featuring Apple CEO Tim Cook and IBM chair Ginni Rometty \u2014 was swiftly derided on social media as \u2018clueless\u2019 and \u2018tone-deaf\u2019 given the pandemic, recession and Trump\u2019s own familial employment history,\u201d Hamza Shaban reports. \u201cThe nation currently has 5.4 million job openings, according to the Labor Department, which is not nearly enough for the roughly 18 million Americans who are officially unemployed and the 33 million who are currently receiving unemployment benefits. Many saw the campaign as insensitive given the suffering of Americans whose livelihoods disappeared as the pandemic forced companies to shutter or sharply curtail operations. And for many, Ivanka Trump \u2014 the daughter of a billionaire and a multimillionaire in her own right \u2014 is the wrong person to speak to the challenges of finding a job.\u201dFaulty data collection has raised questions about the administration\u2019s Paycheck Protection Program claims.\u00a0\u201cA Post analysis of data on 4.9 million loans released last week by the Small Business Administration shows that many companies are reported to have \u2018retained\u2019 far more workers than they employ. Likewise, in some cases the agency\u2019s jobs claim for entire industries surpasses the total number of workers in those sectors. And for more than 875,000 borrowers, the data shows that zero jobs were supported or no information is listed at all, according to the analysis,\u201d Jonathan O\u2019Connell, Emma Brown, Steven Rich and Aaron Gregg report. \u201cThe flaws raise questions about the claims by the Trump administration that 51 million jobs were \u2018supported\u2019 by the [PPP].\u201dThe federal stockpile is thinning out amid the case surge.\u201cThe federal government may not have the capacity to supply medical professionals with personal protective equipment amid the latest surge in coronavirus cases, according to internal administration documents,\u201d NBC News reports. \u201cFor example, the Strategic National Stockpile and the Federal Emergency Management Agency have fewer than 900,000 gloves in reserve after shipping 82.7 million of them \u2014 or just 30 percent of the amount requested by state, local and tribal governments \u2014 since the COVID-19 crisis began. \u2026 Nonetheless, Adm.

Subscribe today.arrow-right1. Why does the U.S. have an issue with Huawei?U.S. government officials say Huawei is dangerous in part because it could use its growing share of the telecom equipment market to spy for the Chinese government. Already in 2012, a report by the U.S. House Intelligence Committee tagged Huawei and ZTE Corp. as potential security threats; the Federal Communications Commission designated them as such this year, a step toward driving them from the U.S. market. Concerns about Huawei drove the 2018 decision by President Donald Trump to block a hostile takeover bid from Broadcom Ltd., based at the time in Singapore, for the U.S. chipmaker Communal Inc. The deal could have curtailed American investments in chip and wireless technologies and handed global leadership to Huawei. Such concerns have grown as carriers begin to spend billions of dollars on new 5G networks, which will collect data and enable services on an unparalleled scale.ADAD2. How important is Huawei?In just over three decades it\u2019s grown from an electronics re-seller into one of the world\u2019s biggest private companies, with leading positions in telecommunications gear, smartphones, cloud computing and cybersecurity, and substantial operations in Asia, Europe and Africa. Huawei generated 850 billion yuan ($122 billion) in sales in 2019 -- more than Boeing Co. It\u2019s plowed billions of dollars into 5G and broke into the top 10 recipients of U.S. patents last year. It has helped build 5G networks in more than 10 countries and expects to do the same in another 20 in 2020. U.S. sanctions spooked some Huawei customers and suppliers globally, while Chinese consumers and carriers rallied to its side.3. Why is its equipment a security issue?ADThe U.S. government \u2014 like the Chinese and others \u2014 is wary of employing foreign technology in vital communications for fear that manufacturers could install hidden \u201cbackdoors\u201d for spies to access sensitive data, or that the companies themselves would hand it over to their home governments. U.S. Secretary of State Michael Pompeo has said the U.S. might hold back intelligence-sharing with NATO allies if they use Huawei equipment, a threat met with some skepticism. The 5G networks are of particular concern because they will go beyond making smartphone downloads faster. They also will enable new technologies like self-driving cars and the Internet of Things. U.K.-based carrier Vodafone Group Plc was said to have found and fixed backdoors on Huawei equipment used in its Italian business in 2011 and 2012. While it\u2019s hard to know if those vulnerabilities were nefarious or accidental, the revelation dealt a blow to Huawei\u2019s reputation.AD4. Who\u2019s using Huawei and who\u2019s not?Japan and Australia are among a handful of places that have joined the U.S. boycott. The U.K. will prohibit its telecom operators from buying Huawei equipment starting next year, and equipment currently installed must be removed by 2027. Countries such as India and Vietnam are considered unlikely to use Huawei. But the company has won 5G customers in Russia, the Middle East and Asia, including the Philippines and Thailand. Its equipment tends to be less expensive than alternatives from Nokia Oyj and Ericsson AB and is often higher quality. In Malaysia, the prime minister has said his country will use \u201cas much as possible.\u201dAD5. What\u2019s going on elsewhere?Norway decided against a ban, leaving the choice to individual companies; so far two have gone with Ericsson. Huawei lost two big contracts in Singapore this year but still has a foothold in the market. In the European Union, there are signs of a coordinated balancing act. German Chancellor Angela Merkel is grappling with a potential revolt by lawmakers who want to effectively ban Huawei equipment. China\u2019s ambassador to Germany threatened Berlin with retaliation if such a ban were adopted, citing the millions of vehicles German carmakers sell in China. Brazil has said it isn\u2019t excluding anyone from bidding.AD6. What else has the U.S. done?ADThe U.S. has moved to curb Huawei\u2019s ability to sell equipment in the U.S. and, more significantly, to buy parts from U.S. suppliers, by adding Huawei to a Commerce Department blacklist in 2019. Accusing the company of seeking to \u201cundermine\u201d those export controls, the department on May 15 imposed further restrictions on chipmakers using American gear in designing or producing semiconductors, meaning suppliers such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. will have to cut off Huawei unless they get a waiver from Washington -- or potentially face penalties. The FCC prohibited the use of federal subsidies to buy equipment made by Huawei and ZTE and said it would consider requiring carriers now using the products to remove them.7. What\u2019s going on in Canada?In December 2018, at the request of the U.S., Canadian authorities arrested Huawei\u2019s chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, who\u2019s also the daughter of the company\u2019s founder, Ren Zhengfei. The U.S. is seeking her extradition as part of a criminal case alleging that she conspired to defraud banks into unwittingly clearing transactions linked to Iran in violation of U.S. sanctions. Both Meng, who is also deputy chairwoman, and the company have denied wrongdoing. Canada is still deciding whether to allow Huawei to play a bigger role in developing 5G.ADAD8. Who else has accused Huawei?In 2003, Cisco Systems Inc. sued Huawei for allegedly infringing on its patents and illegally copying source code used in routers and switches. Huawei removed the contested code, manuals and command-line interfaces and the case was dropped. Motorola sued in 2010 for allegedly conspiring with former employees to steal trade secrets. That lawsuit was later settled. In 2017 a jury found Huawei liable for stealing robotic technology from T-Mobile US Inc., and on Jan. 28, 2019, the Justice Department indicted Huawei for theft of trade secrets related to that case. The same month Poland, a staunch U.S. ally, arrested a Huawei employee on suspicion of spying for the Chinese government. Huawei fired the employee and denied any involvement in his alleged actions.9. What does Huawei say?ADADThat U.S. restrictions are not about cybersecurity but are really designed to safeguard American dominance of global tech. It has repeatedly denied that it helps Beijing spy on other governments or companies. But bracing for continued pressure, it outlined plans to shake up its management ranks as revenue growth slowed. The company, which says it\u2019s owned by Ren as well as its employees through a union, has in recent years begun releasing financial results, spent more on marketing and engaged with foreign media in an effort to boost transparency. Ren has become more outspoken as he fights to save his company. While he said he was proud of his military career and Communist Party membership, he rejected suggestions he was doing Beijing\u2019s bidding or that Huawei handed over customer information. In March 2019, Huawei went on the offensive, filing a lawsuit in federal court against a statute that blocks U.S. government agencies from using its equipment.10. Are other Chinese companies feeling the heat?Yes. In October, the Trump administration placed eight other Chinese tech giants on its blacklist, accusing them of being implicated in human rights violations against minority Muslims in the country\u2019s Xinjiang region. They included Hangzhou Hikvision Digital Technology Co. and Zhejiang Dahua Technology Co., which by some accounts control as much as a third of the global market for video surveillance; SenseTime Group Ltd., the world\u2019s most valuable artificial intelligence startup; and fellow AI giant Megvii Technology Ltd. ZTE almost collapsed after the U.S. Commerce Department banned it for three months in 2018 from buying American technology. The U.S. Justice Department has charged state-owned Fujian Jinhua Integrated Circuit Co., its Taiwanese partner and three individuals with conspiring to steal trade secrets from Micron Technology Inc.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P.", "comment": "0 Comments", "topic": "Business"}, {"cover": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ZYHBLGGCVUI6VN62LAB3FFHENU.jpghttps://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ZYHBLGGCVUI6VN62LAB3FFHENU.jpg", "title": "The Technology 202: Tech to contain coronavirus on college campuses sparks fresh privacy concerns", "date": "Jul 10, 2020", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/the-technology-202-tech-to-contain-coronavirus-on-college-campuses-spark-fresh-privacy-concerns/2020/07/10/26aa0fd2-3725-4409-bfac-28855146e037_story.html", "keyword": "China and Security", "website": "the Washington Post", "author": "Cat Zakrzewski", "content": "Colleges across the country are scrambling to pandemic-proof their campuses.

That is why it is also a great pity that we, our strong region, are now facing a very strong increase in the number of infections,\u201d Antwerp provincial governor Cathy Berx was quoted as saying by local newspaper Gazet van Antwerpen. \u201cWhich may also lead to an increase in hospital admissions and unfortunately possibly also in the number of deaths.\u201dADThe curfew should enter into force once the decision is signed by Berx.Wilmes said that the restrictions at federal level \u2014 which also include lowering crowd limits at public events to 100 people indoors and 200 people outdoors \u2014 could be sufficient to avoid further restrictions and to ensure children can return to school en masse in September, after the summer break.ADWilmes exhorted people to get back to working remotely when possible, \u201cone of the keys for a successful deconfinement.\u201d She added that shoppers should run errands alone from now on and limit the time they spend in stores to 30 minutes. In addition, family or friends\u2019 gatherings \u2014including wedding receptions \u2014 will be limited to a maximum of 10 people.\u201cHowever, the most important approach is the individual one,\u201d Wilmes said. \u201cIf we cannot contain the coronavirus, it will be a collective failure.\u201dADMeanwhile, Brussels mayor Philippe Close announced the cancellation of the 140th edition of the city\u2019s annual summer funfair, saying it was impossible for the popular event to take place on account of the latest health guidelines.ADBelgium, a country with 11.5 million inhabitants, has been particularly hard hit by the virus, with more than 66,000 cases and 9,821 deaths. The government had already tightened restrictions last week, making the use of face masks mandatory in crowded outdoor spaces while requiring bar and restaurant owners to register contact details of customers.___Read all the AP stories about the coronavirus outbreak that emerged from China at https://apnews.com/VirusOutbreakCopyright 2020 The Associated Press.

President Donald Trump has begun stripping away that \u201cspecial status\u201d to punish China for moves to tighten its grip on the city after a year of pro-democracy street protests. At its most extreme, that could mean the global financial hub being treated the same as any other Chinese city -- a seismic shift that could harm both economies at an already difficult time. China has already begun retaliating.Support our journalism. Subscribe today.arrow-right1. Is the special status gone?It\u2019s going. On May 27, Secretary of State Michael Pompeo notified Congress that the Trump administration no longer regarded Hong Kong as autonomous from mainland China. On June 29, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said the special status had therefore been revoked.ADAD2. What\u2019s been the impact?In an opening salvo, Pompeo announced visa restrictions against unspecified Chinese officials; China did the same against Americans. Pompeo said the U.S. would also cease selling defense equipment to Hong Kong, a largely symbolic act that will mostly affect the city\u2019s police and corrections forces. The Commerce Department made it harder to export sensitive American technology to Hong Kong by suspending special treatment in areas including export license exceptions; Hong Kong\u2019s leader said the impact would be \u201cminimal.\u201d More far-reaching measures could follow. The city is still treated differently from the the mainland when it comes to tariffs, for instance.3. Why so slow?ADIt\u2019s up to Trump to decide how quickly he wants to move while he\u2019s also threatening consequences for China over its handling of the coronavirus and its repression of minorities in Xinjiang province. Hurting China also carries additional risks for the U.S. economy, including the U.S.-China trade deal that Trump had considered one of his biggest achievements, which could affect his odds of winning re-election. Trump has made harsh comments but hasn\u2019t threatened specific punishments for the Beijing government.AD4. What\u2019s at stake for Hong Kong and China?While Hong Kong remains a key gateway from China to the rest of the world, it matters far less to the country\u2019s fortunes than it once did. In 2019, 12% of China\u2019s exports went to or through Hong Kong, down from 45% in 1992. China is also far less reliant on inflows of foreign capital and expertise, and has made a much lower priority of making the yuan an international currency. Nonetheless, the city still matters. Hong Kong\u2019s open capital account and adherence to international standards of governance are unmatched by any mainland Chinese city and make it an important base for international banks and trading firms. Revoking the special status would be \u201cthe nuclear option\u201d and \u201cthe beginning of the death of Hong Kong as we know it,\u201d said Steve Tsang, director of the University of London\u2019s SOAS China Institute.AD5. And their financial markets?ADOne worst-case scenario: if the U.S. treats Hong Kong no differently than any other Chinese city, why wouldn\u2019t ratings firms and investors do the same? It\u2019s a question posed by Deutsche Bank, which noted that S&P Global Ratings has Hong Kong three notches above China while Moody\u2019s and Fitch have Hong Kong one notch higher. The risk is that China\u2019s own rating gets lowered in coming years and drags Hong Kong\u2019s with it. At the same time, equity index providers may take a fresh look at Hong Kong, which is currently in the MSCI World Index with other developed markets. China is in the emerging market index, raising the question, should Hong Kong be treated the same as Shanghai and Shenzhen?6. What about for the U.S.?ADIt has its own reasons for not rocking the boat too much. Hong Kong, the only semi-democratic jurisdiction under Chinese rule, offers U.S. companies a relatively safe way to access the Chinese market and employs a U.S. dollar peg, linking it with the American financial system. According to the Congressional Research Service, the largest U.S. trade surplus in 2019 was with Hong Kong \u2014 $36 billion. Hong Kong counted 278 U.S. companies with regional headquarters in the city that year and another 457 with offices. Hong Kong\u2019s first justice minister after the handover to China in 1997, Elsie Leung, told the South China Morning Post in May that any damage would be mutual: \u201cWe are not just getting the benefits \u2013 it\u2019s a free-trade arrangement which is good for both sides.\u201dAD7. How has China responded?Despite the U.S. action, Chinese lawmakers approved new national security legislation for Hong Kong anyway. The Foreign Ministry has promised unspecified retaliation against what it terms foreign interference, insisting Hong Kong is purely an internal affair. China said last year it would sanction some U.S.-based activist groups including the National Endowment for Democracy, Human Rights Watch and Freedom House, and suspend port visits by U.S. Navy ships to Hong Kong. The official Xinhua News Agency has dismissed as \u201cgroundless\u201d accusations about the loss of freedom or human rights issues in Hong Kong. It also noted that the 2018 Human Freedom Index compiled by the Fraser Institute, a Vancouver-based think tank, ranked Hong Kong at No. 3, well ahead of the U.S. at No. 17.AD8. And Hong Kong?ADThe city\u2019s leader, Chief Executive Carrie Lam, has defended the national security law (as has Li Ka-shing, Hong Kong\u2019s richest tycoon). Lam also has said it would be \u201ctotally unacceptable\u201d for foreign legislatures to interfere in Hong Kong\u2019s internal affairs, and that sanctions would only complicate the problems in the city. (Lam was selected in 2017 by a committee of 1,200 political insiders overwhelmingly loyal to the Chinese government.) She has sought to reassure investors that the city still adheres to the rule of law and has an independent judiciary. She also has defended police actions.9. Is this what the protesters have been seeking?ADAs a largely leaderless movement, the Hong Kong protests have made no official request for international assistance. But some prominent activists including Jimmy Lai and Joshua Wong called on Trump to hit China hard with sanctions, even to the point of revoking the city\u2019s special trading status. Wong had testified last year in Washington in favor of the bill, seeking to put pressure on China. On the streets of Hong Kong, some protesters have made clear their interest in U.S. support by waving American flags, singing \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner\u201d and calling on Trump to \u201cliberate\u201d Hong Kong. Such rallying cries are now illegal in Hong Kong under the new national security law.(An earlier version corrected the first name of Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross in question 1)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P.", "comment": "0 Comments", "topic": "Business"}, {"cover": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ET7W6JWK7AI6VGNQQQTOE3JAHM.jpghttps://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ET7W6JWK7AI6VGNQQQTOE3JAHM.jpg", "title": "The Daily 202: As a baseball season like no other finally begins, escaping coronavirus proves impossible", "date": "Jul 23, 2020", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/07/23/daily-202-baseball-season-like-no-other-finally-begins-escaping-coronavirus-proves-impossible/", "keyword": "China and Security", "website": "the Washington Post", "author": "James Hohmann", "content": "with Mariana AlfaroA reporter approached Sen.

But our nation faces cascading crises: the worst civil unrest since 1968, the worst economic upheaval since 1933 and the worst public health emergency since 1918. This morning\u2019s jobs report shows another 1.4 million workers filed for unemployment benefits last week, the 18th straight week that more than a million Americans have filed claims.ADOther ongoing crises get less attention because of the contagion, but that does not mean they have been solved. There is an opioid crisis causing deaths of despair, the climate crisis that imperils the future of the planet, a looming sovereign debt crisis that most political leaders seem nonchalant about, rising great-power conflict with China, including a new space race, and fresh complications overnight in Afghanistan as America struggles to exit her longest war.ADProfessional sports offer a comfortable getaway from the challenges of life and the burdens of reality. For a few hours, and a few bucks, you can go to the ballpark and escape. That has always been part of the joy that comes with the price of admission.On this Opening Day of the Major League Baseball season, delayed by nearly four months because of the coronavirus, such escapism is impossible. Largely, this is because no one is safe from covid-19. To wit, the Kansas City Royals revealed Wednesday that Hunter Dozier, who hit 26 home runs last season, tested positive and will be placed on the injured list.ADThis abridged 60-game season, instead of the usual 162, will not be baseball as we know it; it might better be described as covidball. First off, there will be no spectators allowed in the stands, so all of us will be watching on television and fake crowd noise will be piped into the ballparks.There is supposed to be social distancing \u2013 and mask wearing \u2013 in the dugout. Players have been told not to give high-fives. Or spit. Or chew sunflower seeds. Coaches have been told they are not allowed to touch their faces.\u00a0ADTradition-bound Major League Baseball has made rule changes that would have been considered sacrilege not long ago, including introducing designated hitters in the National League and starting extra innings with an automatic runner on second base.\u00a0ADHistorically and culturally, baseball has been far less political and polarized than professional football and basketball. Players have tended to be less outspoken than their counterparts in other sports. (I touched on this in 2017 after completing a personal quest to watch games at all 30 major league stadiums.)But times are changing. The sport has not been immune to the national reckoning on racial injustice. San Francisco Giants manager Gabe Kapler and several of his players knelt during the national anthem earlier this week before an exhibition game, provoking an attack by Trump. \u201cLooking forward to live sports,\u201d he tweeted on Tuesday, \u201cbut any time I witness a player kneeling during the National Anthem, a sign of great disrespect for our Country and our Flag, the game is over for me!\u201dADIn a show of solidarity, \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d will be stenciled on several mounds across the league this weekend, including in Washington. The league has also given players the option to wear patches on their jerseys that use the phrase.ADThe topsy-turvy process that got us to Opening Day has itself been a metaphor for the country\u2019s broader struggle to control the virus. Baseball is the first of the big four sports to play a regular season game since March. The United States has lagged Europe and Asia in restarting professional sports. Players are being tested regularly now, but there have been long delays in turning around results \u2013 just like for the rest of society \u2013 that limit the values of the tests.\u00a0So often, it has felt like America just cannot catch a break these past few months. It is perhaps apt that the forecast calls for scattered thunderstorms to linger in Washington into the evening before tapering off after sunset.Tony Fauci, the government\u2019s top infectious-disease expert, will throw the ceremonial first pitch of the first game at 7 p.m. Eastern in Washington as the Nationals take on the New York Yankees. ESPN will broadcast it live. In a video released Wednesday by the Nationals, the 79-year-old Fauci said he was nervous about getting the ball past home plate. Washington star Ryan Zimmerman told him not to worry. \u201cIf you bounce it, there's nobody there to boo you,\u201d he quipped.ADADI will never forget flying to Houston last October to watch the Nationals win in the World Series with my dad. But it feels hard to believe that incredible playoff run was just nine months ago. It feels like nine years.The season opener is a doubleheader: The Dodgers will play the Giants tonight in Los Angeles after the Nationals-Yankees game. But San Francisco\u2019s star catcher Buster Posey will not play. He has opted to sit out the season because he and his wife adopted identical twin girls who were born prematurely, and he doesn\u2019t want to put them at risk. Among the dozen or so other stars skipping this season are Zimmerman, Atlanta\u2019s Nick Markakis, Los Angeles\u2019s David Price and Colorado\u2019s Ian Desmond.The members of my fantasy baseball league normally gather in the basement of a Capitol Hill bar for an annual draft. This year, we gathered virtually to respect social distancing protocols. We also waited to hold our draft until late last night because so many players kept announcing that they wouldn\u2019t play this season. None of us wanted to pay for pitchers and hitters who will not generate any stats for our teams.ADAD(For those who care about the game, the roster for \u201cThe 202s\u201d includes Gerrit Cole, Francisco Lindor, Clayton Kershaw, Nelson Cruz, Javier Baez, Jose Altuve, Matt Olson, Eddie Rosario and Kyle Schwarber. Picking Cole as one of my starting pitchers creates a somewhat awkward dynamic tonight because I will be cheering for the Nationals as the new Yankees ace starts against them. So it goes.)Everything comes with some risks amid the pandemic. The first road game for the Nationals will be against the Toronto Blue Jays. But no one knows where that game will take place because Canada is not allowing its sole MLB team to play in the country. On Wednesday, the state of Pennsylvania told the Blue Jays that they will not be allowed to play their home games this season at PNC Park in Pittsburgh, as they had hoped to do.\u201cIn recent weeks, we have seen a significant increase in the number of COVID-19 cases in southwestern Pennsylvania,\u201d said Rachel Levine, secretary of the state Department of Health, in a statement. \u201cTo add travelers to this region for any reason, including for professional sports events, risks residents, visitors and members of both teams. We know that this virus does not discriminate and can even make professional athletes very sick. We are committed to protecting the health and well-being of all Pennsylvanians.\u201dMore team coverage:Thomas Boswell: \u201cThis MLB season will be weird and not without risk. I can\u2019t wait.\u201dJesse Dougherty: \u201cThis was not the Opening Day the Nationals had planned, but at least it\u2019s here.\u201dDave Sheinin: \u201cThe baseball season starts Thursday.

(You can take it here.)The coronavirusAnecdotal evidence is mounting that you can get covid-19 twice, but doctors remain unsure.\u201cWhen Sophie Cunningham, a guard for the WNBA\u2019s Phoenix Mercury, returned to training last week after a bout with covid-19, she \u2026 said she believed she had been infected twice \u2014 once in March and then again in June or July,\u201d Carolyn Johnson and Ariana Eunjung Cha report. \u201cDaniel Griffin, an infectious diseases doctor and researcher at Columbia University Medical Center, said that with every virus \u2014 including chickenpox, for which antibodies are supposed to last a lifetime \u2014 there are cases of people who become sick again after recovering from the initial illness. When it comes to Ebola, American doctor Ian Crozier was declared free of the virus but then doctors found it lurking in his eye. In HIV/AIDS, a baby in Mississippi born to an HIV-positive mother was thought to be cured but then the virus reemerged 27 months after therapy was stopped. So in a world where 14.5 million people have had the coronavirus, a small number with resurgent sickness should not be cause for alarm. \u2026\u00a0ADAD\u201cAt the University of Pennsylvania, there was the pregnant woman infected in March who was fine for two months and then became so sick during childbirth she had to be put on a ventilator. At Cleveland Clinic, there was a patient with very mild symptoms in February \u2014 just a loss of smell and taste \u2014 who was well for two months, but then needed to be hospitalized in early May and was confirmed to have the virus again. And at ProHealth Care in Long Island, there was a man infected at the end of March who was never sick enough to be hospitalized. He showed up again in July, this time very ill. \u2018He thought he had an immunity shield, so he took care of his son when he got covid,\u2019 Griffin said. \u2018Two weeks later, he was in the ER.\u2019 The man, who had a very high antibody response the first time and donated his plasma so it could be used to treat other coronavirus patients, had barely any when doctors recently tested his blood in the hospital.\u201dThere are conflicting explanations for what\u2019s going on. \u201cFor severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), the antibodies seem to last for a year or longer. But other coronaviruses, such as the four that cause the common cold, act differently. People seem to be able to get them each season, over and over again,\u201d Carolyn and Ariana report. \u201cLast week, a British study posted to a preprint server added to the body of evidence that virus-fighting antibodies drop off steeply two to three months after infection \u2026 It was quickly followed by another study, also not peer-reviewed, of antibodies in nearly 20,000 New Yorkers with mild or moderate covid-19 symptoms. After retesting 120 of those people three months later, researchers at Mount Sinai Health System found virus-fighting antibodies were largely stable and had even increased in people that started with lower levels right after their infections.\u201dThe Senate GOP scrapped Trump\u2019s demand for a payroll tax cut.Senate Republicans have cast aside one of Trump\u2019s key demands in their emerging coronavirus stimulus package, refusing to include a payroll tax cut in their opening offer to Democrats, which Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) is aiming to announce later today. \u201cThe development came amid a frantic GOP effort to try and salvage other parts of the package, though the entire process remained fluid and there was confusion among Republican aides about when a deal might be reached,\u201d per Erica Werner, Seung Min Kim and Jeff Stein.ADADAscena Retail Group, the conglomerate behind women\u2019s apparel brands Ann Taylor, Lane Bryant and Catherines, filed for bankruptcy and said it would close some of its 2,800 stores. (Abha Bhattarai)LinkedIn, which is laying off 960 staff, joins a growing group of employers announcing layoffs for white-collar jobs, as coronavirus losses continue to ripple beyond low-wage work to better-paying jobs in auto manufacturing, technology and consulting. \u201cEconomists and human resources experts said the job cuts at LinkedIn were further evidence that hiring for white-collar jobs has stalled and did not bode well for a short-term recovery,\u201d Jena McGregor reports.The top executives of biotechnology company Novavax stand to collect millions even if their vaccine never makes it to the market. The stock options earmarked for CEO Stanley Erck and three other executives are worth more than $100 million.

(Hamza Shaban)The U.S. will soon surpass 4 million confirmed cases.\u00a0\u201cTrump painted a wishful view Wednesday of the U.S. response to the coronavirus pandemic, in which existing treatments can almost cure patients flooding hospitals, all schools will safely reopen this fall, and the country\u2019s soaring cases are confined to a handful of states,\u201d William Wan and Jacqueline Dupree report. \u201cThe rosy assessment he issued at a White House news briefing \u2026 was undermined by the alarming reality that on Wednesday, almost every metric showed just how badly America is losing its fight against the virus. The number of daily deaths on Wednesday surpassed 1,100, the first time that mark had been reached since May 29. And total deaths in the United States since the start of the pandemic increased to more than 140,000. California on Wednesday passed New York in the number of total confirmed coronavirus cases \u2026\u00a0\u201cWith transmission rapidly spiking in many areas, governors in Indiana, Minnesota and Ohio joined the growing number of states mandating face coverings statewide. More than 30 states require people to wear masks. \u2026 [Trump] declined to press for a nationwide mandate for masks, despite the near-universal urgings of public health experts. \u2026 On Wednesday, an influential model\u00a0created by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation \u2026 said wider mask-wearing by Americans had caused the institute to revise projections on how many people will die of covid-19 by Nov.\u00a01. Earlier, it had forecast 224,500 deaths by that date. Now, it estimates 219,900 deaths by Nov. 1 \u2014 a decrease of about 5,000 deaths. If 95 percent of Americans wore masks when leaving their homes, that number would drop further to 185,900, IHME researchers said.\u201dA Texas county is storing bodies in trucks because so many residents are dying.\u201cTexas, which reported 197 deaths and 10,893 hospitalizations, has been one of the states hardest hit by the resurgent coronavirus. Hidalgo County, at the southern tip of the state on the U.S. border with Mexico, has seen cases rise 60 percent in the last week \u2026 with deaths doubling to more than 360,\u201d Reuters reports. \u201cCrematoriums in the Hidalgo area have a wait list of two weeks \u2026 forcing the county to use five refrigerated trucks that can hold 50 bodies each.

Greg) Abbott\u2019s move to override local officials for the spike in coronavirus infections, which he said has jammed the local medical system at every level.\u201dBanks face a unique coronavirus problem: Robbers in masks.Financial regulators and banks fear masks could double as handy disguises for would-be bank robbers, and there have been a few mask-involved attempted robberies. \u201cIn one case, a man walked into a Houston bank with a bandanna covering his face and handed a teller a note: \u2018I didn\u2019t get a stimulus or that 10k loan. I lost my business to Covid so please make this easy and comply,'\" Renae Merle reports. \u201cAnother would-be robber in Florida, entered a Wells Fargo branch wearing sunglasses, gloves and a white cone-like mask over his face. He approached a teller\u2019s window demanding money, according to the arrest warrant. But the bank employee had trouble hearing the robber\u2019s demands \u2014 through the mask. \u2018The male got upset and repeated himself several times\u2019 and eventually left empty-handed, according to the arrest warrant. \u2026 Despite the robbery attempt, Wells Fargo began requiring customers to wear masks July 13. They are also required by Bank of America. JPMorgan Chase said its employees are required to wear masks but they would comply with local ordinances when it comes to their customers.\u201d\u00a0D.C. imposed one of the most stringent mask requirements in the country.\u00a0\u201cMayor Muriel E. Bowser said her order requires people older than 2 to wear a mask when they leave the house and are likely to come into contact with others. It\u2019s one of the strictest mask ordinances in the country \u2014 and came on the same day the city recorded 102 new coronavirus cases, the highest daily number since early June,\u201d Julie Zauzmer, Ovetta Wiggins, Dana Hedgpeth and Rachel Chason report. \u201cJohn Falcicchio, the mayor\u2019s chief of staff, said D.C. police will be empowered to fine people not wearing a mask, although the city expects such fines to be limited. As the city\u2019s case counts rise, Health Director LaQuandra Nesbitt said Wednesday that an increasing proportion of those newly diagnosed infections involve younger people.\"\u00a0ADThe virus could push 250,000 into hunger in the D.C. region, according to a report by the Capital Area Food Bank.

This is beneath us.\u2019 As Wheeler stood at the fence, he was heckled and insulted. \u2026 For hours before Wheeler\u2019s brush with chemical irritants, the mayor made a contentious and, at times, tense attempt to talk with protesters. On the wall of the justice center behind him, activists had displayed a list of demands. The last demand on the list, which included defunding the Portland Police Bureau by 50 percent and expelling federal forces from the city, was for Wheeler to resign. \u2026 After nearly an hour, Wheeler had enough. A thick cloud of gas hung over the place where he stood as he and two security officers pushed through the crowd and away from the federal building.\"The House voted to remove Confederate statues from the Capitol.\u00a0The chamber also voted to \u201creplace the bust of Roger B.

(Olesia Plokhil)The electionsAt least 76 percent of American voters can cast ballots by mail this fall.\u201cAs of now, nearly 180 million Americans who are eligible to vote would be able to cast a ballot by mail. Of those, 22 million live in states that will accept fear of the coronavirus as an excuse to vote absentee, or have switched to become \u2018no excuse\u2019 states,\u201d Kate Rabinowitz and Brittany Renee Mayes report. \u201cThirty-four states and the District of Columbia already allowed anyone to vote absentee. But many of these places are making the process easier. California will start proactively mailing ballots to registered voters, joining universal vote-by-mail states such as Colorado. Many states will send every registered voter an absentee-ballot application. These types of statewide expansions affect another 63 million eligible voters. In some states like Nebraska, individual counties are planning to send mail-in voting applications in the absence of a statewide directive. For voters in nine states \u2013 Connecticut, New York, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina, Texas and West Virginia \u2013 in-person voting remains the only option unless they can provide an approved reason not related to fear of the coronavirus. Traditional absentee excuses include military deployments or illness.\u201d\u00a0Republican lawmakers are privately having conversations about what happens if Trump refuses to relinquish power.\u201cMost legal experts said it is hard to envision that Trump would actually try to remain in office after a clear defeat by Biden, considering the uproar that would follow,\" Elise Viebeck and Robert Costa report. \"But his unwillingness to commit to a smooth transition of power has forced academics and political leaders \u2014 including, privately, some GOP lawmakers \u2014 to contemplate possible scenarios. \u2026 Among the possibilities: Trump could claim victory before the vote in key states is fully counted \u2014 a process that could take days or even weeks this year because of the expected avalanche of absentee ballots. He could also spend weeks refusing to concede amid a legal war over which votes are valid and should be included in the tally \u2026 Or he could simply refuse to leave on Jan. 20. \u2026 This year, the president has attacked the security of voting by mail at least 50 times \u2026 There is no evidence that mail voting leads to the kind of massive fraud Trump has described. \u2026\u00a0\u201cIn GOP circles, private talk about Trump\u2019s assertions veers from alarm to shrugging off his comments as simply incendiary political salvos. One moderate Republican House member, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to comment candidly and avoid Trump\u2019s wrath, said he expects Trump to \u2018leave quickly\u2019 if it is a blowout defeat. But he said he worries about a narrow election and whether Trump would go to extreme lengths to \u2018protect his personal brand.\u2019 \u2018It\u2019s something we\u2019d all rather not think about, but it\u2019s there,\u2019 he said.

(Colby Itkowitz and John Wagner)Trump keeps bragging about passing a cognitive test, but it doesn\u2019t mean what he thinks it does.\u201cIn another Fox News interview [last night], Trump couldn\u2019t resist revisiting what he said was the hardest part of the test \u2014 repeating five words, in order. Trump said he was first asked to repeat a set of words \u2014 \u2018person,\u2019 \u2018woman,\u2019 \u2018man,\u2019 \u2018camera,\u2019 \u2018TV,\u2019 he said, offering a hypothetical example \u2014 and then, later in the assessment after some time had elapsed, he was again asked whether he remembered those same words, in order,\u201d Ashley Parker and William Wan report. \u201c\u2018And they say\u2026 \u2018Go back to that question, and repeat them. Can you do it?\u2019\u2019 Trump said, mimicking the doctors administering the exam. \u2018And you go, \u2018Person, woman, man, camera, TV.\u2019 They say, \u2018That\u2019s amazing. How did you do that?\u2019 I do it because I have, like, a good memory, because I\u2019m cognitively there.\u2019 \u2026 Experts say the president\u2019s fixation on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment \u2026 is particularly puzzling because the test is normally administered only if someone is concerned that they or their loved ones may be experiencing dementia or other cognitive decline. Getting a perfect score \u2014 as Trump has repeatedly claimed he did \u2014 merely signifies that the test-taker probably does not have a cognitive impairment as measured by the exam.\u201dSenate primaries are exposing growing fissures inside the GOP.The Senate Leadership Fund formally took a side Wednesday in a contested GOP primary for a candidate to succeed retiring Kansas Sen.

In countries such as Afghanistan, U.S. troops are merely serving as \u201cpolice,\u201d he has argued, while Germany, South Korea and others that could afford to defend themselves are getting U.S. protection on the cheap at taxpayer expense.ADBut Trump has been stymied at virtually every turn.

When the president ordered him in 2018 to tell Persian Gulf partners to send their own troops to Syria so the United States could get out, former national security adviser John Bolton wrote in his recent book, Bolton slow-walked the idea until it went away. Trump eventually cut the numbers by more than half, without any Arab replacements or financial contribution.Trump has often said that he is treated unfairly. \u201cI am the only person who can fight for the safety of our troops and bring them home from the ridiculous & costly Endless Wars, and be scorned,\u201d he tweeted in October. \u201cDemocrats always liked that position, until I took it.\u201dADThe idea of bringing home the troops resonates with many across the political spectrum. But numerous lawmakers of both parties have objected to Trump\u2019s efforts. Most recently, senior Republicans have warned that a major reduction in Germany would limit U.S. military flexibility in Europe and beyond, decrease U.S. influence in NATO and be a gift to Russia.ADLate last month, Senate Republicans Lindsey O. Graham (S.C.), Marco Rubio (Fla.) and Mitt Romney (Utah) joined Democratic Sens. Christopher A. Coons (Del.), Tim Kaine (Va.) and Jeanne Shaheen (N.H.) in sponsoring an amendment to the fiscal 2021 Defense Authorization Act that would limit the use of funds to reduce active-duty troops in Germany unless the Defense Department could certify that a long list of restrictive conditions had been met.At NATO, few diplomats believe that a significant troop pullback from Germany \u2014 a massive personnel and logistical undertaking \u2014 can be accomplished before the end of the year, or that the infrastructure exists to house them elsewhere in Europe. U.S. opinion polls detailing Trump\u2019s plummeting popularity are being closely watched in alliance capitals and at the Brussels headquarters. NATO policymakers say that if Democrat Joe Biden is elected, they expect the troop reductions to be off the table.ADGerman officials were furious at having learned of the planned cuts from U.S. media reports.

Like they have,\u201d the diplomat added with a clear touch of sarcasm.In the meantime, the official alliance position is that \u201cthe U.S. remains firmly committed to European security,\u201d a NATO official said.\u201cWhat we have seen over the last years is actually not a decrease but an increase in the U.S. presence in Europe,\u201d said the official, including a strong U.S. commitment to bolstering NATO\u2019s eastern flank with rotating deployments and pre-positioned equipment.ADArmy Secretary Ryan D. McCarthy told reporters Thursday as he returned from a multi-stop visit to Europe that he had not had any \u201cdirect discussions about the repositioning of forces on the continent at this time.\u201d\u201cThat information will be released in the coming weeks,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s all I\u2019ve got to say about that topic.\u201dADMcCarthy acknowledged that Poland and Lithuania have both expressed interest in having more U.S. troops in their countries if the United States is reshuffling its European profile. Polish President Andrzej Duda, a Trump favorite, last year offered to build a base there and name it Fort Trump.When Duda visited the White House on June 24, four days before the first round of voting in his reelection bid, Trump granted his wish, saying vaguely that \u201csome\u201d of the forces to be withdrawn from Germany would go to Poland. Duda was narrowly reelected in a runoff vote last week.ADTrump has long been harshly critical of Germany, charging that it is insufficiently grateful for U.S. \u201cdefense\u201d and has failed to pay its fair share of NATO expenses. Explaining his plans for the 9,500 troops, he told columnist Marc Thiessen this month that \u201cI\u2019m bringing about half home and half are going to different places that deserve it,\u201d including Poland.ADPentagon officials have said that the \u201crepositioning\u201d of forces around the world \u2014 in large part to confront China \u2014 is part of a comprehensive and long-overdue review of all U.S. overseas deployments expected to be completed in September.Indications earlier this year that downsizing was likely in Africa, where U.S. forces are fighting militant groups, brought howls of congressional disapproval and warnings of Islamic State and al-Qaeda expansion there.ADMilitary officials have long been expecting the U.S. troop footprint in the Middle East and Afghanistan to shrink at least modestly because of a trio of factors, including a reduced Islamic State, a hoped-for political settlement in Afghanistan and, perhaps most important, Trump\u2019s desire to reduce U.S. involvement in insurgent conflicts.But critics have warned that a reduced U.S. presence would conflict with the administration\u2019s pledge to continue \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d against Iran.ADThe first phase of the February U.S.-Taliban agreement \u2014 a downsizing of the American force in Afghanistan to 8,600 \u2014 has now been completed, eliminating the force expansion Trump authorized in 2017. The agreement envisions a full U.S. departure by the end of April, providing that the militants meet their commitments to reduce violence and embrace negotiations with the Afghan government.ADThe Pentagon has drawn up plans to reach a \u201cwaypoint\u201d in its own compliance with the deal, perhaps by late fall, by withdrawing another 4,000 troops. But the required Taliban and Afghan government progress in implementing the political aspects of the agreement has slowed, and violence is on the rise.In Iraq, administration officials have said the ongoing presence of U.S. forces, now numbering more than 5,000, is vital to continue training and assisting Iraq\u2019s security forces against Islamic State outbreaks, and to help Iraq resist Iranian dominance.ADMany Iraqi lawmakers demanded the full departure of American troops following the U.S. killing of Iranian military leader Qasem Soleimani in a Baghdad drone strike in January. Talks with the new government of Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi, who is due to visit Washington this month, are ongoing. Administration officials say they are optimistic and expect only a modest reduction in the force.Since early in his presidency, Trump has demanded that South Korea, where 28,500 U.S. troops are based, and Japan, which hosts more than 55,000, pay more for a robust American military presence.Washington and Seoul struggled to reach a cost-sharing deal in 2018. They ended up with only a one-year extension, to the end of 2019, with South Korea agreeing to pay $926\u00a0million, an 8\u00a0percent increase.Last year, Trump asked for a fivefold increase in what South Korea pays and threatened to \u201cget out of there if we don\u2019t get the five-billion-dollar deal,\u201d according to Bolton. No agreement has been reached, and in April more than 4,000 South Korean civilians employed at U.S. bases there were placed on unpaid furlough. They went back to work in June, after Seoul agreed to pay them in a $200\u00a0million stopgap measure.The Wall Street Journal reported last week that the Pentagon has presented the White House with a list of options to reduce forces there. On Monday, Esper said during a think tank event that he had not ordered any troop withdrawals from the peninsula but was looking at potential adjustments to force levels worldwide.Japan faces the same demand to pay more when its current cost-sharing deal runs out at the end of March.

Subscribe today.arrow-rightUber is the latest to do so, announcing it would double the number of its black leaders by 2025, both by hiring and bolstering the careers of existing employees.\u00a0\u201cAs a company that powers movement, it\u2019s our goal to ensure everyone can move freely and safely, whether physically, economically or socially,\u201d Uber chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi wrote in a blog post. \u201cTo do that, we must help fight the racism that persists across society and be a champion for equity, both inside and outside our company.\u201dAirbnb earlier this summer promised that 20 percent of its board of directors and executive team, collectively, will be people of color by the end of 2021. \u00a0The announcements mark a growing shift in the tech industry.\u00a0Many companies for years have released diversity reports detailing their demographic makeup, often breaking out details about racial representation across technical and leadership roles. But now they\u2019re taking it a step further by pulling the curtain back on their hiring goals \u2014 and setting clear deadlines for hitting them. \u00a0ADAD\u201cThere's no way in the absence of a goal to understand if you fall short, why you fell short and what assumptions you made,\u201d said Karla Monterroso, the chief executive of the diversity nonprofit organization Code2040. \u201cYou can just keep going in a hamster wheel if you don't have a goal. So in that, I do think that move is progress.\u201dThe announcements follow broader pressure on the tech industry to diversify, as the killing of George Floyd in police custody earlier this year prompted a national reckoning over American race relations. Many Silicon Valley companies have responded by releasing statements in support of the Black Lives Matter movement, with promises to address racial inequities both inside their companies and in the services they build.\u00a0Monterroso said it's \u201cway too early to tell\u201d if the recent wave of diversity commitments will result in lasting change in the industry.\u00a0ADAD\u201cPutting the stake in the ground is the easiest thing to do,\u201d she told me. \u201cHolding people to that stake in the ground is a much harder thing.\u201d\u00a0The public goals could make it easier to hold companies accountable to their aggressive promises.\u00a0Now employees, shareholders and the media now have a clear benchmark to hold the companies' hiring against, Monterrosso told me.\u00a0But diversity experts warned there are some key downsides. \u00a0It\u2019s unclear if these companies have the policies and culture in place to support people of color after hiring them. Nicole Sanchez, managing partner and founder at Vaya Consulting, warned that diversity programs could be mismanaged in the same way as affirmative action on some college campuses. She said recently hired or promoted employees could have to confront the myth that the company is \u201clowering the bar\u201d by setting aggressive hiring goals, she said.\u00a0ADAD\u201cI am concerned that companies don't understand how to mitigate the potential harm they do to those people they are hiring under these new initiatives,\u201d she told me in an interview.\u00a0She also warned that companies may not be prepared for the ways increasing the number of diverse employees could change their existing culture, and warning company leaders need to prepare.\u201cCompanies that say they want to diversify will diversify and then be shocked at how the company is being asked to change,\u201d Sanchez said.\u00a0Companies have previously seen pushback from existing employees to similar efforts. \u00a0Monterrosso said any time a company embarks on efforts to diversify its culture, it can be met with resistance.\u00a0AD\u201cIf you have not started the work of inclusion early in your life cycle, you have inevitably hired people who are not going to view this as a priority and who are going to view this adversarially, at a minimum,\u201d she said.\u00a0ADThose tensions could be intensified during a pandemic, particularly at companies where the workforce is contracting due to the economic downturn. Both Airbnb and Uber have laid off employees in recent months. Some experts are skeptical about the companies' ability to hit their diversity goals, especially given the struggles confronting the ride-hailing and travel industry at the moment.\u00a0\u00a0Melissa Thomas-Hunt, head of global diversity and belonging at Airbnb, said the company remains \u201cunwavering\u201d in its diversity commitments.\u00a0AD\u201cThese efforts demand a laser focus and we know that building a workforce that reflects the world and the local environments is not just about who we invite into the company, but how we ensure that people of all backgrounds, identities and experiences are able to thrive because they are made to feel respected, valued and able to contribute at their highest level at our company,\u201d she said in a statement.\u00a0ADBut Sanchez remains wary of companies that are very public about their diversity work.\u00a0\u201cThe companies that are doing this thoughtfully and methodically right now are very quiet about it because they would like to celebrate once they hit those milestones,\u201d she said.There's some precedent for tech companies to release goals like this.\u00a0Twitter in recent years has been including hiring goals in its diversity reports, and says they've contributed to progress. Since workforce targets were introduced in 2018, the company's global female representation has increased by 4.1 percentage points, and U.S. representation \u00a0of black and Latinx employees has increased by 2.4 and 1.5 percentage points, respectivelyAD\u201cWhile goal setting has been a point of controversy in diversity and inclusion, we know representation targets work, because we\u2019ve seen it in action,\u201d Twitter spokeswoman Catherine Hill said in a statement. \u201cThe introduction of workforce representation targets were a catalyst to increased investment, organizational alignment, transparency and accountability.\u201dADBut some companies have struggled to hit their goals.\u00a0Pinterest was the first company to publicize diversity hiring goals in 2015. The rollout was controversial because the company had previously missed hitting some of its publicly announced goals; the company for the first time this year exceeded all of its hiring targets.ADMore diverse hiring is is no panacea for the problem, however. Black women who previously worked at the company have accused Pinterest of racial discrimination.\u00a0Our top tabsMicrosoft President Brad Smith met with the House antitrust subcommittee.\u00a0The longtime executive discussed concerns about the way Apple operates its app Store during a virtual meeting with lawmakers several years ago, The Information's Christopher Stern and Nick Wingfield report. They discussed the \u200capp Store\u200c's approval processes and the 30 percent cut that Apple takes from app purchases and subscriptions.\u00a0ADEuropean regulators are also currently probing the app store for antitrust-related concerns. Microsoft is no stranger to antitrust scrutiny itself, and the conversation comes as the chief executives of Amazon, Apple, Google and Facebook are expected to testify in front of the subcommittee next week.\u00a0ADSmith previously called for greater regulation of app stores at a Politico event.\u00a0\u201cThe time has come - whether we are talking about D.C. or Brussels - for a much more focused conversation about the nature of app stores, the rules that are being put in place, the prices and the tolls that are being extracted and whether there is really a justification in antitrust law for everything that has been created,\u201d he said.\u00a0Phone companies temporarily shut down a test run of President Trump's text message program over spam concerns.Cellular providers' spam monitors took the voter outreach program offline after the campaign sent out more than 1 million pro-Trump fundraising messages over the Fourth of July weekend, Alex Isenstadt and John Hendel at Politico report.\u00a0ADThe program wasn't back up for five days, during which White House senior adviser Jared Kushner reached out to Verizon and T-Mobile executives to restore the it. Republicans are concerned about the consequences of a repeat shutdown closer to Election Day, when the program will be used to drum up turnout.\u00a0Politico estimated the campaign lost millions of dollars in potential fundraising during the outage.\u00a0The outage also fueled ongoing allegations that Big Tech is working against Trump's reelection.\u00a0\u201cThey\u2019re all working to get out the vote, so to see telecom come down and prevent any campaign or organization from getting out the vote is troubling,\u201d Tim Cameron, a digital strategist who has worked for the National Republican Senatorial Committee and former Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich, said.But it was third-party administrators, not the companies, that flagged the program as spam, Politico reports.\u00a0Democrats have also run into issues with peer-to-peer texting programs, which have been caught up in ambiguous regulations of robocalling. The Federal Communications Commission more recently ruled that peer-to-peer texting is not spam so long as the texts are sent individually.\u00a0Governments want Google to stop requiring users to turn on location tracking to use coronavirus apps.\u00a0A growing number of countries who use the software to support contact tracing are concerned the requirement undermines Google's promises to respect user privacy, Natasha Singer at the New York Times reports.\u00a0Google's virus tracing software uses Bluetooth, not location data. However, Google's Android operating system requires phones to turn on location data as part of its Bluetooth scanning. Apple does not.Some governments worry Google may misuse the loophole to access users' precise locations. Both Latvia and Switzerland have pushed the company to change its requirements.\u00a0\u201cUsers should be able to use such proximity tracing apps without any bindings with other services,\u201d said Dr. Sang-Il Kim, the department head for digital transformation at Switzerland\u2019s Federal Office of Public Health, said.Google spokesman Pete Voss says that apps could not access the location data without user permission.The privacy clash could also contribute to further delays in the United States.

Drezner", "content": "About a year ago I was hard at work on a paper that eventually appeared in the Washington Quarterly evaluating the Trump administration\u2019s record on economic statecraft. It was pretty unsparing:First, the administration\u2019s use of economic diplomacy to secure economic concessions has achieved surprisingly little, and there is no reason to expect a better record in the future. Second, the administration\u2019s maximum pressure campaigns have succeeded at imposing costs on targets but have not led to better bargains. Third, the administration has hamstrung many of its efforts through basic errors of diplomacy. A statecraft gap is emerging between the United States and the other great powers capable of playing this game; simply put, the United States is getting worse at economic diplomacy just as other countries are learning how to adroitly wield economic instruments.I am an academic, which means I also wrote in the conclusion that \u201cit is certainly possible that, a year or two from now, this record might look better.\u201d In the technocratic spirit of updating one\u2019s assessments as the data changes, let\u2019s take a look at the administration\u2019s myriad efforts at economic statecraft to see whether the record has improved or worsened.Support our journalism. Subscribe today.arrow-rightLet\u2019s start where I was wrong. There are two areas where economic statecraft has generated greater returns than what appeared to be true in 2019. The first is that President Trump\u2019s tariff threats unambiguously altered Mexican behavior toward Central American migrants. As Politico\u2019s Sabrina Rodriguez reports:ADADTrump succeeded in using the threat of tariffs to ensure Mexico would deploy its National Guard, which was created to fight crime and restore public safety, along Mexico\u2019s southern border to stop Central American migrants from traveling north to seek asylum in the United States. [Mexican President Andr\u00e9s Manuel] L\u00f3pez Obrador also agreed to allow asylum seekers to remain in Mexico while they wait for their court hearings in the U.S.Indeed, the most underreported foreign policy success of this administration has been the appeasement strategy of L\u00f3pez Obrador, a longtime leftist politician who had railed against Trump\u2019s invective just a few years ago.Rodriguez suggests Mexico\u2019s pliancy is due to shared populism between Trump and AMLO. That is possible, except as the Politico story notes his non-populist predecessor Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto pursued the exact same appeasement strategy.The likelier explanation is that Mexico\u2019s asymmetric dependency on the U.S. market gives the U.S. considerable bargaining leverage, and AMLO is preempting the use of that leverage. This has made Trump very happy, and justifiably so given what his Mexican counterpart has delivered.ADAnother area where U.S. pressure has yielded improved results has been the effort to prevent Huawei and ZTE from playing a role in the construction of 5G networks in allied countries. Last year, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo went on a road show to pressure U.S. allies to block Huawei. Allies remain unconvinced, and even the United Kingdom had made a decision in January to allow Huawei to play a role.ADThat said, transatlantic concern about China has been on the rise. In recent weeks U.S. partners have changed their tune. Singapore announced last month it would limit Huawei to noncore elements of its 5G networks.The bigger move came Tuesday, however, when the United Kingdom reversed course and banned telecom companies from procuring new Huawei equipment. U.S. sanctions played a key role. CNN\u2019s Hadas Gold reported, \u201cDigital and Culture Minister Oliver Dowden said new US sanctions imposed on the company in May had \u2018significantly changed\u2019 the landscape.\u201d The Wall Street Journal\u2019s Stephen Fidler and Max Colchester characterize it as \u201ca sharp about-face that marks a significant victory for the U.S.\u201d and they ain\u2019t wrong.ADSo, in 2020 U.S. economic pressure has yielded more positive results from allies and partners. This was an area where the Trump administration had badly underperformed compared to theoretical expectations, so it deserves credit for a genuine increase in target concessions.ADOn the other hand, when one looks at the administration\u2019s \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d campaigns, a different picture emerges. From North Korea to Iran to China, the outcome has worsened in the past year.The idea of progress in North Korea had always been a mirage, but Pyongyang has been more explicit about that in recent weeks. Slate\u2019s Fred Kaplan noted Monday, \u201ceven that the deal Kim offered at last year\u2019s summit with President Donald Trump in Hanoi, Vietnam \u2014 to shut down one nuclear reactor in exchange for the lifting of all U.S. sanctions since 2016 \u2014 is now off the table.\u201d It might be North Korea\u2019s leadership is hoping a desperate Trump will accede to any deal in the middle of a campaign. The point, however, is despite a parlous economic situation, North Korea is not conceding anything.ADAs for Iran, even high-ranking Trump administration officials are unwittingly admitting failure. In a Monday op-ed, national security adviser and permanent D-lister Robert O\u2019Brien wrote, \u201cin May 2018, Trump pulled our nation out of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, another one-sided agreement that failed to block Iranian nuclear ambitions. Iran is now closer than ever to enriching enough uranium for a nuclear device and has spent the past six years expanding its ballistic-missile program.\u201d As the head of the International Crisis Group tweeted, \u201cthis is a damning indictment of the Trump administration\u2019s Iran policy \u2014 not of the JCPOA.\u201dADThe U.S. maximum-pressure campaign has also pushed Iran closer to China. The New York Times\u2019 Farnaz Fassihi and Steven Lee Myers reported on a new partnership agreement between the two countries:Iran and China have quietly drafted a sweeping economic and security partnership that would clear the way for billions of dollars of Chinese investments in energy and other sectors, undercutting the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to isolate the Iranian government because of its nuclear and military ambitions.The partnership, detailed in an 18-page proposed agreement... would vastly expand Chinese presence in banking, telecommunications, ports, railways and dozens of other projects. In exchange, China would receive a regular \u2014 and, according to an Iranian official and an oil trader, heavily discounted \u2014 supply of Iranian oil over the next 25 years.The document also describes deepening military cooperation, potentially giving China a foothold in a region that has been a strategic preoccupation of the United States for decades. It calls for joint training and exercises, joint research and weapons development and intelligence sharing \u2014 all to fight \u201cthe lopsided battle with terrorism, drug and human trafficking and cross-border crimes.\u201d...It represents a major blow to the Trump administration\u2019s aggressive policy toward Iran since abandoning the nuclear deal reached in 2015 by President Barack Obama and the leaders of six other nations after two years of grueling negotiations.China has excelled over the last decade in driving hard bargains with countries facing U.S. sanctions. This is of a piece with those deals, which helps to explain domestic nationalist blowback in Tehran to the agreement. Furthermore, the details remain fuzzy, much like the initial Russia-China energy deals after the annexation for Crimea. Still, that alliance has proved more durable than many in Washington expected, so attention should be paid to this.ADSo over the past year the Trump administration has cadged greater concessions from allies but faces a worsening strategic situation with adversaries. That track record resembles more past administrations a bit more than in 2019, although the overall record is still quite underwhelming.ADThere is one way, however, in which the Trump administration\u2019s efforts at economic statecraft have been an unmitigated disaster. Contrary to what they expected, their multiple trade wars have not yielded better trade deals. Instead, as Politico\u2019s Ryan McCrimmon observes, the Trump administration has converted globally competitive sectors into rent-seekers:Government payments to farmers have surged to historic levels under President Donald Trump as the Agriculture Department floods the industry with cash to stem the financial losses from Trump\u2019s tariff fights and the coronavirus pandemic.But as agriculture grows more reliant on unprecedented taxpayer support, farm policy experts and watchdog groups warn the subsidies are growing too big and too fast, with no strings attached and little oversight from Congress \u2014 and that Washington could have a difficult time shutting off the spigot.Direct farm aid has climbed each year of Trump\u2019s presidency, from $11.5 billion in 2017 to more than $32 billion this year \u2014 an all-time high, with potentially far more funding still to come in 2020, amounting to about two-thirds of the cost of the entire Department of Housing and Urban Development and more than the Agriculture Department\u2019s $24 billion discretionary budget.Social scientists have long been aware that economic sanctions and trade wars can inculcate sectors with a vested interest in protection. The Trump administration\u2019s trade wars have been so wide-ranging, however, that it has succeeded in converting outward-facing business sectors into subsidy addicts. The result has been a few more concessions from allies, a worsening strategic situation, an industrial recession, and an agricultural sector addicted to corporate welfare.Not great, Donald.", "comment": "3 Comments", "topic": "PostEverything"}, {"cover": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/6SS44DWAJ4I6VCIINCRLT2XJ4A.jpghttps://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/6SS44DWAJ4I6VCIINCRLT2XJ4A.jpg", "title": "The Finance 202: PPP data dump to fuel debate as lawmakers craft next coronavirus stimulus", "date": "Jul 7, 2020", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/the-finance-202-ppp-data-dump-to-fuel-debate-as-lawmakers-craft-next-coronavirus-stimulus/2020/07/07/7efb1922-6786-425a-a935-144664549c36_story.html", "keyword": "China and Security", "website": "the Washington Post", "author": "Brent D.

How does it work?The Hong Kong Monetary Authority, the de-facto central bank, has a mandate to keep the currency trading at HK$7.75 to HK$7.85 per U.S. dollar. The current band was set in 2005 and has never been broken, although it\u2019s often tested. When it gets too close to one end or the other, the HKMA intervenes, either by buying or selling the city\u2019s dollars.2. Why does keeping the peg matter?First and foremost, the currency peg is considered an anchor for financial stability and the economy. Investors park their money in Hong Kong because the currency is relatively safe and easily convertible -- one of the reasons the city became a global financial center in the first place. Breaking the peg would upset that whole equation.ADAD3. What\u2019s the threat?It\u2019s politics. After China in May said it would impose new national security legislation on Hong Kong, the Trump administration said the city was no longer sufficiently autonomous from the mainland to warrant the \u201cspecial status\u201d granted by the U.S. for trading purposes. The opening salvo from the U.S. included visa restrictions and a suspension of some export license exceptions, and more far-reaching measures could follow, such as on tariffs. The current arrangement also allows for U.S. dollars to be freely exchanged with Hong Kong dollars, which if revoked would amount to what often gets called the \u201cnuclear option.\u201d4. Why is that?ADIf the Trump administration were to limit the HKMA\u2019s access to U.S. dollars, that could hamper the city\u2019s ability to defend its currency tie to the greenback. Such an extreme move would likely prompt people to pull money out of Hong Kong, putting even more pressure on the currency. (Unlike mainland China, where capital flows are tightly controlled, Hong Kong allows money to flow in and out unrestricted.) Fortunes big and small could be lost if the currency collapsed.AD5. What are the chances?Bloomberg News reported in July that the idea of striking against the Hong Kong dollar peg -- perhaps by limiting the ability of Hong Kong banks to buy U.S. dollars -- had been raised as part of broader discussions among advisers to Secretary of State Michael Pompeo, but that it also faces strong opposition from others in the administration who worry such a move would only hurt Hong Kong banks and the U.S., not China. Previously, Eddie Yue, chief executive of the HKMA, had described the idea an \u201capocalyptic\u201d scenario that could backfire on Trump. \u201cWith Hong Kong\u2019s financial system closely integrated with the global economic and financial systems, any move that hits our financial system would also send shock waves across the global financial markets, including the U.S.,\u201d he said. \u201cConfidence of international investors in using the USD and holding U.S. financial assets could also be undermined.\u201dAD6. Are people worried?ADThere is little sign of it yet. The currency is trading at the strong end of its band, as impending public stock offerings boost demand for Hong Kong dollars. Bank deposits in Hong Kong increased 0.8% in April from the previous month, the biggest gain in six months. Sustained periods of outflows have occurred during previous bouts of stress such as the global financial crisis and SARS epidemic, and when the U.S. Federal Reserve was raising interest rates. The fear arose again last year as political upheaval roiled the city, though ultimately capital flows remained broadly stable.7. Should they be?Officials in Hong Kong say no. The HKMA has more than $430 billion of foreign reserves itself. China\u2019s central bank also can provide U.S. dollars through a currency swap line should Washington impose sanctions on the city, said Financial Secretary Paul Chan. China has the world\u2019s largest foreign-exchange reserves at more than $3 trillion.ADAD8. Could Hong Kong just peg its dollar to the Chinese yuan instead?The HKMA says no. For the time being, the U.S. dollar is the \u201cmost appropriate anchor currency\u201d because it is fully convertible and can be traded freely in large amounts on foreign exchange markets. The yuan doesn\u2019t fit that bill. The U.S. dollar also functions as an international reserve currency and the Fed has a good record of fostering price stability. In addition, Hong Kong\u2019s business cycles are \u201cstill more synchronized\u201d with the U.S. than mainland China, it says.9. What usually moves the Hong Kong dollar?Often it\u2019s interest rates, especially when local ones don\u2019t move in tandem with the U.S. For example, when interbank rates on the Hong Kong dollar -- known as Hibor -- remain elevated as the Fed reduces borrowing costs, it becomes more attractive for investors to buy the Hong Kong currency against the greenback. The gap between Hibor and the U.S. currency\u2019s Libor has been around the widest since 1999 since March, helping to push the Hong Kong dollar to HK$7.75 for the first time since early 2016. That prompted the HKMA in April to sell the city\u2019s dollars to prevent a break of the peg.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P.", "comment": "0 Comments", "topic": "Business"}, {"cover": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/I65ZG6GKNFE43IRIXULOR5UXBYhttps://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/I65ZG6GKNFE43IRIXULOR5UXBY", "title": "The Trailer: The 'squad' gears up for two tough primaries", "date": "Jul 26, 2020", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/07/26/trailer-squad-gears-up-two-tough-primaries/", "keyword": "China and Security", "website": "the Washington Post", "author": "David Weigel", "content": "In this edition: The fight to save two members of the \u201csquad,\u201d a pile of new polling from swing states, and New York starts to deal with its mess of an election system.As of right now, the federal government cannot actually arrest mayors it disagrees with, and this is The Trailer.Support our journalism. Subscribe today.arrow-rightDETROIT \u2013 The day after her 44th birthday, Michigan Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D) gathered supporters and volunteers at a juice bar in her district for a socially distanced party. Rashida-for-Congress sanitary wipes shared table space with birthday cake. A tracker snuck in and was quickly ushered out by the congresswoman herself. When it came time to speak, Tlaib choked up, reflecting on how her district had come together to protest police brutality and stand with Black Lives Matter.AD\u201cThis is the only place that ever truly embraced everything about me, including that little edge, and that little rawness that I have,\u201d Tlaib said. \u201cAll the different colors of rainbow are out there, marching, and saying black lives matter. And they know that it's not only about who killed George Floyd, and police brutality; it's about the systems that set up George Floyd to be killed in that way.\u201dADIn nine days, Tlaib will defend her seat against Brenda Jones, the Detroit City Council president she defeated by just 900 votes in the 2018 primary. Last time, the district's mostly black electorate splintered behind other candidates. This time, her opponents united behind one opponent.\u00a0One week later, fellow squad member Rep. Ilhan Omar (D) of Minnesota will face challenger Antone Melton-Meaux, who rocketed from obscurity to raise $3.7 million by arguing that the congresswoman is too \u201cdivisive\u201d to represent Minneapolis. Omar, who won easily in 2018, is feeling the backlash from comments she made about pro-Israel donor influence and from a trio of campaign finance controversies, all of it thrown back at her in millions of dollars of ads.\u00a0ADIn the first primaries of this year, as the presidential contest wound down, the resurgent left that elected Tlaib and Omar was mostly focused on expansion. Campaign organizations that had helped elect the \u201csquad\u201d \u2013 Tlaib, Omar, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), and Rep. Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.) \u2013 ousted more conservative Democratic incumbents in Illinois and New York. There are a few more targets on the calendar, such as activist Cori Bush's rematch with Rep. William Lacy Clay of Missouri, and a challenge to House Ways and Means Chairman Richard Neal in western Massachusetts.ADBut for the next few weeks, the squad is playing defense. Seven hundred miles apart, Jones and Melton-Meaux make roughly the same argument about the incumbents: That they are too abrasive and too famous, that their cities would be better off with representatives who could work across the aisle and make less news. In an interview, Jones repeatedly cited the comments Tlaib made on her first day in Congress, promising to impeach the president, and referring to him with an unprintable epithet.\u201cHow often have you, as a reporter, heard someone speak like that?\u201d Jones asked. \u201cEven when you disagree with someone, there is a professional manner of disagreeing with them. I am a professional legislator. I am a professional worker. And I think that professionalism is important in doing the job of representing the people.\u201dADJones did represent the district briefly, at the end of 2018. The resignation of Rep. John Conyers Jr. created a special primary election to fill his seat the same day as the primary for a two-year term. Tlaib won the six-way primary, while Jones won the four-way special. That put Jones in the House for a few weeks, and her campaign's advertising asks voters to \u201creturn\u201d Jones to the seat. In advertising from Concerned Citizens of Michigan, a pro-Jones PAC, black voters are told that \u201cthe 13th belongs to us\u201d and that it's time to \u201ctake our seat back.\u201dADTlaib's rebuttal has been her record. When she mentions impeachment, it's typically to say that the same president she voted to impeach has signed her legislation; when asked about that, Jones points out that the Republican Senate hasn't taken up some of Tlaib's work, such as an amendment to spend billions of dollars replacing lead water pipes.Local Democrats long expected Jones to run, pointing to the results from 2018, when nearly two-thirds of Detroiters backed one of Tlaib's rivals. \u201cI think it\u2019s about numbers,\u201d said Ian Conyers, a former state senator and grandnephew of the former congressman. Like the three other candidates who ran behind Tlaib and Jones two years ago, he has endorsed Jones: \u201cIf there had been a runoff in 2018, Brenda Jones would have won. It almost feels like Rashida has an opinion and a prescription that the people of the district themselves have not asked for.\u201d\u00a0ADTlaib does hold some advantages. The city council president did not officially announce she was running until March 25, a week into the state's stay-at-home order. Eight days later, Jones tested positive for the coronavirus and has made only limited public appearances since. Tlaib has raised more than $3 million, double what she spent to win the seat in the first place; Jones has raised less than $140,000, less than half of what she spent in the crowded 2018 race.ADIt's another story in Minnesota, where the official Democratic Farmer-Labor Party has rallied behind Omar, but her challenger is set to outspend her in the final stretch. Melton-Meaux, an attorney who'd never run for office, trailed in fundraising until the last few months before the primary. But he established himself a credible competitor. Since March, Melton-Meaux has brought in millions of dollars, most of it from Minnesotans, and nearly half a million of it bundled by the pro-Israel NORPAC and Pro-Israel America PAC.The money has funded a steady stream of direct mail and TV ads against Omar. The ads don't focus on the incumbent's position on Israel. Instead, they portray Omar as \u201caggressive\u201d and corrupt, emphasizing some fundraising controversies that made as much news in national conservative media as they did in Minnesota. One involves a misuse of funds for travel, which Omar paid a 2019 fine to settle; one is more personal, accusing her of funneling campaign money to her husband's firm.ADOn Saturday, Omar defended her use of E Street, which played the same role in her successful 2018 campaign before she married the firm's co-founder Tim Mynett. \u201cThey've contracted vendors for us to not only run ads, digital ads, but also to do all of our mailers, and online fundraising,\u201d Omar said of Mynett's firm. \u201cThey are a one-stop shop.\u201d (The firm's other founder has also defended Omar.)ADTlaib and Omar arrived in Congress with similar profiles on the issue of Israel, and both opposed a resolution condemning the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions movement. Asked why donors had rallied behind Omar's opponent, but not Tlaib's, Michigan Democrats speculated that Tlaib's district would likely be broken by redistricting in 2022 anyway. Any map in Minnesota is likely to keep Omar's 5th District, which covers Minneapolis and its closest suburbs, largely intact. But a simpler reason is that of a Palestinian American and a refugee from Somalia who came up through local activism, Omar has been more frequently attacked by conservatives.In this race, Omar has emphasized her leadership role in the Congressional Progressive Caucus, and her support for Medicare-for-all; Melton-Meaux said he favors other health-care reforms but would support Medicare-for-all \u201cif it were to come across my desk.\u201d She\u2019s also questioned Melton-Meaux\u2019s r\u00e9sum\u00e9 as an attorney with an emphasis in workplace mediation whose old law firm helped companies fight union drives. \u201cThere's no evidence that this mediation is something that's ever been deployed in bringing people together in our community,\u201d Omar said. \u201cOn the contrary, I have a track record of being a coalition builder.\u201d Asked about his legal work, Melton-Meaux said that he had no role in anti-union work at a \u201cmultinational firm that does a lot of different things.\u201dADShe has also tried to paint Melton-Meaux's backers as Wall Street cronies and Republicans, like telecom executive and Trump donor\u00a0Howard Jonas. \u201cLook at the sheer amount of money that is coming from people who funded Donald Trump and Mitch McConnell,\u201d Omar said in an interview, recalling the cries to \u201csend her back,\u201d an insult directed at the two Muslim members of Congress, who, in Omar\u2019s words, have been \u201cothered.\u201d \u201cThey're giving to a man who agrees with the sentiment that we shouldn't be in Minnesota, that we shouldn't have representation in Congress, that our voices and visibility in the halls of Congress is an inconvenience.\u201d\u00a0ADBut Melton-Meaux has pushed back. \u201cThe support we've got from PACs is from nonpartisan organizations that have given to Democrats and Republicans, including Democrats like Senator [Tina] Smith and Majority Leader Steny Hoyer and even, yes, Joe Biden,\u201d Melton-Meaux said in an interview. \u201cWhat's really happening here is that the congresswoman does not want people to know just how much strength we have here in the district.\u201dAs incumbents, she and Tlaib benefit from the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee's rule that contractors who work for challengers to Democratic incumbents can't work with DCCC candidates; Melton-Meaux has criticized that rule. \u201cIt's a decision that I think, frankly, is trying to chill the democratic process. I have a constitutional right to run for this office,\u201d he said.\u00a0ADBut Melton-Meaux has less than three weeks to convince Minneapolis to ditch Omar, and Jones has less than two weeks to win over Detroit. Meanwhile, Omar's campaign has activated her national supporters, bringing both Tlaib and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont together for a virtual \u201cday of action\u201d on Sunday. At Tlaib's Saturday party, Angela Gallegos, 34, recalled how she met the future congresswoman at a protest, more than a decade ago, before either of them were involved in electoral politics.AD\u201cWhen I see the opponent's sign, that's almost equivalent of a Trump sign to me,\u201d Gallegos said. \u201cLike, why are you doing that to my girl? It's Rashida. Everyone knows her.

Instead of being processed 30 days before an election, voters\u2019 requests for absentee ballots will be processed as soon as they\u2019re received. Like voters in states that previously implemented expansive mail voting, New Yorkers will be informed of their ballot status and get chances to \u201ccure\u201d it \u2014 ie, to fix an error that left the ballot uncounted by election officials. Connecticut, one of the few remaining Democratic-run states that requires an excuse for requesting absentee ballots, took a step closer to nixing that with a broad, bipartisan vote in the state House of Representatives.In Illinois, the first state where Kanye West obtained signatures to petition onto the ballot, five voters have challenged his filing. While West only needs 2,500 signatures to appear as a presidential candidate \u2014 he did not file the name of a running mate \u2014 he filed around 3,200 total signatures. That\u2019s in the danger zone for a successful challenge, as scrutiny can sometimes remove 20 to 30 percent of the names on petitions, if voters\u2019 identities cannot be verified. (In weekend tweet, West suggested he could \u201cbeat Joe Biden off write-ins,\u201d though only 10 states and the District of Columbia count write-in votes for candidates who have not filed for official status.)\u00a0West may have missed the deadline to make the ballot in Maine, where petitioning ended on Saturday. Meanwhile, the state's Republicans are continuing their effort to end the state's ranked-choice voting system, after a petition drive to put it on the ballot for November failed. A new federal lawsuit argues that ranked-choice voting disenfranchises those who don't want to rank more than one candidate; if successful, the lawsuit could change calculations about the state's presidential and Senate contests, where third parties and independents currently pose no \u201cspoiler\u201d risk to either party. (While Democratic Rep. Jared Golden won his 2018 race thanks to second-choice voters who'd supported a left-wing challenger, there is no third party in his race this year.)Ad watchIlhan Omar, \u201cBallot Box.\u201d The Minnesota congresswoman waited until this week to run ads ahead of her Aug. 11 primary. This one boils down a longer campaign video into a message about activism in which she only sometimes appears, wearing a mask and casting a vote. \u201cWe can translate our cries for justice into legislation, and that's the fight we've been leading in Congress,\u201d says Omar, whose voice is the only one in the spot.Americans for Tomorrow's Future, \u201cSelf-Dealing.\u201d The super PAC has mostly played in Omar's race with harsh direct mail; its first ad compiles a series of financial controversies into a story of the congresswoman benefiting from her role. \u201cShe's paid her new husband's business over $1 million in campaign funds,\u201d a narrator says. That's the only cash total mentioned in the spot, as the civil fine Omar paid for a long-running expenses scandal was just $500.Rashida Tlaib, \u201cRooted.\u201d The main ad in rotation for Tlaib's campaign, it combines quick flashes of her legislative record (\u201cRep. Tlaib secures $1.5 billion for access to water for families\u201d) to the kind of high-profile stances her opponent, Brenda Jones, has pegged as too distracting from her job (\u201cDeny ICE its request for more funding, abolish it.\u201d).Concerned Citizens of Michigan, \u201cTake Our Seat Back.\u201d A PAC created to help Jones, CCM's TV ad argues that the legacy of the late John Conyers can be filled by Jones. It never says outright that Jones can represent the district better because she's black. But the only white politician seen in the ad is former House speaker Paul Ryan, from 2018, swearing in Jones to fill the final weeks of Conyers's expired term. \u201cThe 13th belongs to us,\u201d a narrator says. \n  \n  \n  You are reading The Trailer, the newsletter that brings the campaign trail to your inbox.  \n   \n   \n    \n   \n   \n  \n \nPoll watchThere are just 100 days left until the general election, and fewer days until early and absentee voting starts across most of the country. The calendar was enough of a hook for multiple news outlets to conduct swing state polls, with some wide variances but one consistency: Democrats are holding a lead, with the president trailing Joe Biden when voters are asked who is best able to handle the pandemic and social unrest.Here\u2019s a poll-by-poll look.Midwestern swing states (Fox News, 756/776/795 voters)MichiganJoe Biden: 49%Donald Trump: 40% (-1)MinnesotaJoe Biden: 51%Donald Trump: 38%PennsylvaniaJoe Biden: 50%Donald Trump: 39% (-3)The two of these states won by the president four years ago were last polled in April, not long into the coronavirus pandemic. Minnesota, narrowly lost by Donald Trump in 2016, is polled for the first time this cycle, with no evidence that the protests that began there at the end of May have altered the state's defining trend: suburbanites moving toward the Democrats, and \u201cgreater Minnesota\u201d voters in rural counties moving toward the GOP.\u00a0Arizona (NBC/Marist, 826 registered voters)Joe Biden: 50% (+3)Donald Trump: 45% (-1)Since March, the last time NBC/Marist polled the state, the positions of both the president and Gov. Doug Ducey have deteriorated. Just half of Arizonans now approve of Ducey, and just as many as say that the pandemic is getting worse. President Trump's disapproval rating has jumped to 53 percent, with his personal unfavorable rating even higher, at 58 percent. That has opened up the race for Biden, who just 41 percent of voters view favorably. That was Hillary Clinton\u2019s rating in 2016, when she narrowly lost the state. What\u2019s changed? Just 50 percent of voters have a negative view of Biden, compared to 57 percent for Clinton, and Clinton and Trump entered Election Day with the same favorable rating.Swing states (CNN/SSRS, 1,002/1,005/1,003 voters)ArizonaJoe Biden: 49%Donald Trump: 45%FloridaJoe Biden: 51%Donald Trump: 46%MichiganJoe Biden: 52%Donald Trump: 40%Here and in the CBS numbers below, Biden has gained and down-ballot Democratic candidates have inched ahead. In Arizona\u2019s Senate race, Democrat Mark Kelly leads by 7, while in Michigan, Democratic Sen. Gary Peters leads by 16. Both of their opponents have plenty of money and have been on the air for months, but nothing has clicked, and while Michigan challenger James is black, he\u2019s losing nonwhite voters by the same 50-point margin as the president.Rust Belt swing states (CBS/YouGov, 1,177/1,227 registered voters)MichiganJoe Biden: 48%Donald Trump: 25%OhioDonald Trump: 46%Joe Biden: 45%The best set of polls for the president this weekend still show him losing; he\u2019s just holding onto more white voters, and his support from black voters is a bit higher than 2016. (He gets 9 percent of the black vote in Michigan and Ohio; four years ago he got 6 percent and 8 percent of the black vote in those states, respectively.These are the only polls this weekend that suggest a strength for the president: job creation. A majority of voters in both states think Trump would do more than Biden in creating manufacturing jobs, and a plurality of voters think his reductions in environmental regulations have helped the economy. While the Trump campaign has obsessed over policing in its recent ads, there\u2019s an opening there for its anti-NAFTA attacks on Biden. The caveat: In both states, more than two-thirds of voters say they dislike how Trump \u201chandles himself personally,\u201d and in both, only half say that of Biden, who has been appearing in public, at most, for a few hours each week.Candidate trackerPresident Trump stayed off the campaign trail this week, marking a month since what may have been his last traditional rally of the campaign season, in Tulsa. Since Thursday's White House briefing, when he canceled the Republican convention in Jacksonville, Fla., Trump has only fitfully engaged in the campaign. Still, with little fanfare, he continued his run of announcements and executive orders with an order that would force Medicare to pay lower prices for prescription drugs.\u201cAs a result of the orders I\u2019m signing today, the heads of the major drug companies have requested a meeting to discuss how we can quickly and significantly lower drug prices and out-of-pocket expenses for Americans,\u201d Trump said on Friday. \u201cThey want to do what\u2019s right.\u00a0 Look, they\u2019re going to do what\u2019s right.\u00a0Look, I think it\u2019s so important what they\u2019re doing on therapeutics and vaccines.\u00a0And we\u2019re going to see them on Tuesday.\u00a0We\u2019ll see if we can do something here.\u201dJoe Biden had no public events after the middle of the week, but he participated in a virtual Friday fundraiser that focused on Latino issues, co-hosted by actress Eva Longoria.\u201cDay 1, Dreamers are staying, period. They\u2019re more Americans than most Americans are,\u201d Biden said. \u201cThe idea of having to worry if you go to get tested or you go to get help for COVID that you can be deported? No. Not in my country. Not in my country, not going to happen.\"On Saturday, Biden marked one year since a failed effort to grant temporary status to Venezuelans fleeing the country \u2014 a point of contention with some in the party\u2019s left. \u201cThe people of Venezuela and Hispanics across our country deserve a real ally who will stand up for what is right, and not just pay lip service to the suffering of the Venezuelan people,\u201d Biden said in a statement.Countdown\u2026 nine days until primaries in Arizona, Kansas, Michigan, Missouri and Washington\u2026 11 days until primaries in Tennessee\u2026 13 days until primaries in Hawaii\u2026 16 days until primaries in Connecticut, Minnesota, Vermont and Wisconsin\u2026 22 days until the Democratic National Convention\u2026 32 days until the Republican National Convention\u2026 40 days until some absentee ballots start going out\u2026 100 days until the general election", "comment": "333 Comments", "topic": "Politics"}, {"cover": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ZMKKHKV364I6VF6BNTYRN77CNQ.jpghttps://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ZMKKHKV364I6VF6BNTYRN77CNQ.jpg", "title": "Oxford Leads Vaccine Race; U.S. Cases Accelerate: Virus Update", "date": "Jul 2, 2020", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/on-small-business/oxford-leads-vaccine-race-us-cases-accelerate-virus-update/2020/07/01/abfe9b28-bc11-11ea-97c1-6cf116ffe26c_story.html", "keyword": "China and Security", "website": "the Washington Post", "author": "", "content": "U.S. cases jumped the most since May 9 and Florida\u2019s new coronavirus infections rose by a record.

NY)The novel coronavirus is showing some signs of mutating in a way that may make it easier to spread, according to Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases.ADResearch currently underway suggests a single mutation is emerging that lets the virus replicate better and create a higher viral load, measures that could make it easier to transmit, Fauci said at an online event Thursday hosted by the Journal of the American Medical Association.There is some dispute about the findings and it\u2019s not clear whether people who become infected with a newer variation of the pathogen fare worse than those with the original strain, he said. \u201cIt just seems that the virus replicates better and may be more transmissible,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is still at the stage of trying to confirm that.\u201dADModerna Sets Human Trial for Vaccine (1:40 p.m. NY)ADDrug-maker Moderna Inc. said a 30,000-patient trial of its Covid-19 vaccine candidate will start late this month, although a Stats News article earlier Thursday said the work had been expected to begin next week.

NY)The novel coronavirus is showing some signs of mutating in a way that may make it easier to spread, according to Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases.ADResearch currently underway suggests a single mutation is emerging that lets the virus replicate better and create a higher viral load, measures that could make it easier to transmit, Fauci said at an online event Thursday hosted by the Journal of the American Medical Association.There is some dispute about the findings and it\u2019s not clear whether people who become infected with a newer variation of the pathogen fare worse than those with the original strain, he said. \u201cIt just seems that the virus replicates better and may be more transmissible,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is still at the stage of trying to confirm that.\u201dADModerna Sets Human Trial for Vaccine (1:40 p.m. NY)ADDrug-maker Moderna Inc. said a 30,000-patient trial of its Covid-19 vaccine candidate will start late this month, although a Stats News article earlier Thursday said the work had been expected to begin next week.

Subscribe today.arrow-rightThe DNC, which is moving its convention online because of the coronavirus pandemic, released a plan Friday for delegates to vote by email for the Democratic presidential nominee and planks in the party\u2019s platform.\u00a0Internet voting presents far fewer risks in this case than it would during a regular election because delegates\u2019 ballots aren\u2019t secret. That means they can verify their votes weren't altered either by hackers or technological snafus and correct any errors after the fact. There\u2019s also no drama about the outcome of the most important vote because former vice president Joe Biden has basically already secured the Democratic nomination.\u00a0ADADBut it still presents numerous opportunities for hackers from Russia or elsewhere to disrupt the voting process, sow confusion about results or use disinformation operations to spread conspiracy theories or gin up hostilities between rival camps supporting Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.).\u00a0And any disruption is likely to spark painful memories of 2016 when information Russia hacked and leaked from the DNC helped wreak havoc on Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign.\u00a0That means the DNC must be hyper-prepared to knock back any allegations of digital interference or rapidly respond to attacks even as it runs a convention unlike any in history.\u00a0\u201cEven if they\u2019re making a prudent decision for public health, this still remains a rich environment for bad actors,\u201d Edward Perez, global director of technology development at OSET Institute, a nonprofit election technology organization, told me. \u201cNo one should lose sight of the fact that a purely electronic return of ballots is very high risk. The DNC needs to wear both hats at the same time: public health and cyber defense.\u201d\u00a0The DNC has been working for months on how to make a virtual convention work during the pandemic.\u00a0The party passed a resolution in May allowing smaller subcommittees to handle in advance some of the more complex votes that usually take place on the convention floor. The remaining votes, including nominating the party\u2019s candidate for president, will go to all convention delegates on a single ballot delivered by email. They\u2019ll have 12 days to fill that ballot out and forward it by email to state party officials between Aug. 3 and Aug. 15. The convention begins Aug. 17.ADADThose emailed ballots will include the delegate\u2019s name and another unique identifier such as a bar code that connects the delegate with his or her vote, the party said in an email to delegates.\u00a0\u201cThe State Parties will be responsible for collecting all ballots from convention delegates as they would if we were conducting votes in person at the convention,\u201d the letter states. \u201cAt the conclusion of voting, each state delegation chair will submit a tally sheet to the Secretary\u2019s Office that formally records the number of votes cast on each item of convention business.\u201d\u00a0There are a number of built-in security safeguards.\u00a0Delegates will receive email updates when their votes are tallied by state party officials and will be able to reach out to those officials to ensure their votes were correctly recorded, a DNC official told me. Delegates will also have the option of voting by phone or conventional mail if they object to email voting or lack Internet, the official said.\u00a0ADADBiden\u2019s and Sanders\u2019s campaigns hosted webinars this weekend outlining the email-voting system for their delegates.\u201cWe want delegates to play their critical role without risk to their personal or the public health,\u201d said the official, who was not authorized to speak publicly about cybersecurity planning. \u201cWe know who all the delegates are. And because the votes are public, we feel confident that we could swiftly fix any problems that arise.\u201d\u00a0The party is also taking measures to ensure that other elements of the convention aren\u2019t disrupted by hackers such as speeches by Biden and top party officials. That includes buying services from cybersecurity companies and \u201cdeploy[ing] redundant and diverse connections and pathways for the programming and infrastructure that supports the programming,\u201d the official said.\u00a0If a traditional election was held this way, election security experts would be sounding alarms about it.\u00a0Indeed, when a handful of states piloted voting on mobile apps earlier this year, it sparked\u00a0so much concern\u00a0that the Department of Homeland Security, the FBI and the Election Assistance Commission sent states a\u00a0guidance memo\u00a0detailing the risks.\u00a0The memo warned that returning ballots using the Internet poses \u201csignificant security risks,\u201d including that hackers could change large numbers of votes, block votes from being recorded or undermine ballot secrecy.ADADThose risks are significantly mitigated when officials aren\u2019t trying to both send a vote over the Internet and keep the voter\u2019s identity secret. But they\u2019re not eliminated.\u00a0\u201cThe stakes are obviously a lot lower in a party convention setting than a general election context where online voting could be hacked to change the results,\u201d Alex Halderman, a University of Michigan election security expert, told me. \u201cBut what\u2019s at stake here is the legitimacy of the process and for that reason security is still very important.\u201dFor example, hackers could prevent a state from forwarding votes to the DNC by locking up its computers with ransomware or overwhelming its networks with Internet traffic. They could also change large numbers of votes by hacking into delegates\u2019 personal computers and mobile devices. That would probably be caught but not before it publicly embarrassed the party. \u00a0ADAD\u201cI\u2019m less concerned about this instance of remote voting because they won\u2019t be anonymous,\u201d Duncan Buell, a University of South Carolina election security expert, told me. \u201cBut [the DNC] should contract with a really good security firm. They should have backups on top of backups and delegates should be checking their votes were cast the way they expected.\u201dThe committee should also be as transparent as possible so there\u2019s less room for Russia or another hostile nation to spread phony rumors that votes aren\u2019t being counted accurately or to otherwise spark fights between delegate factions, Perez said.\u00a0\u201cJust like the DNC attack in 2016, this creates an opportunity for bad actors to cast doubts on results and further divide us as a nation,\u201d he said.\u00a0The keysTrump is taking credit for the U.K.\u2019s decision to ban\u00a0Huawei from its 5G networks.The president\u2019s boast came after the United Kingdom reversed an earlier decision that would have allowed the Chinese firm to build less-sensitive parts of its next-generation phone and Internet system.\u00a0ADAD\u201cI did this myself, for the most part,\u201d Trump said at a news conference. \u201cIt\u2019s a big security risk. I talked many countries out of using it.\u201dBritish Health Secretary Matt Hancock pushed back on Trump\u2019s claims, saying \u201c\u201cAll sorts of people can try to claim credit for the decision but this was based on a technical assessment by the National Cyber Security Centre about how we could have the highest quality 5G systems.\u201dHancock told Sky News: \u201cWell we all know Donald Trump don\u2019t we.\u201dThe U.K. government expects its 5G network to be totally Huawei-free by 2027 because it will be a lengthy and costly process for British companies to shed all their Huawei gear. The decision came after a U.S. ban on foreign firms selling computer chips made with U.S. equipment to Huawei.ADU.S. security hawks hailed the ban as a victory. U.S. officials have long maintained that Huawei could serve as a back door for Chinese spying. Huawei denies the claims.ADSen. Mark R. Warner (D-Va.), vice chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, urged the Trump administration to work with allies \u201con promoting secure and competitively priced alternatives to Huawei equipment.\u201d\u00a0Sen. Roger Wicker (R-Miss.), chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, also weighed in:The decision could steer other European countries toward banning Huawei or seriously limiting its role in their 5G networks, Ellen Nakashima and William Booth report.\u00a0ADHuawei, meanwhile, blamed the U.K. decision on politics. \u201cThis disappointing decision is bad news for anyone in the U.K. with a mobile phone,\u201d a company spokesman told Reuters. \u201cRegrettably our future in the U.K. has become politicized, this is about U.S. trade policy and not security.\u201d Some trade groups have also criticized the move, saying the timeline could hurt U.K. consumers.A Texas judge denied a request to allow voters with the coronavirus to cast ballots by email in yesterday\u2019s primary runoff.The last-minute request by Harris County officials came on behalf of thousands of quarantined people,\u00a0Zach Despart at the Houston Chronicle reports. An Austin resident in a similar bind had to get a last minute doctor\u2019s note that allowed her to have someone else return her ballot with minutes to spare, the Texas Tribune\u2019s Alexa Ura reports.\u00a0ADThe incidents shows the sort of thorny challenges that are likely to face officials in November as they attempt to run elections in the thick of the pandemic.Meanwhile, some Dallas County voters had their ballots returned to them because of issues with preprinted envelopes, the U.S. Postal Service confirmed Monday. It\u2019s unclear how many voters were affected and if they ultimately risked catching the virus to vote in person. \u201cWe reviewed this issue with the Dallas County Board of Elections before the election as well as last week, advising them how to correct the problem,\u201d\u00a0USPS\u00a0told Dallas news station WFAA in a statement.Other primary and runoff elections went relatively smoothly yesterday in Alabama and Maine.\u00a0Spain is the latest nation accused of using spyware to go after political opponents.Roger Torrent, the speaker of a regional parliament in Spain\u2019s Catalonia region, alleges the Spanish government used controversial spyware from the Israeli company NSO Group to hack his phone, the Guardian reports.\u00a0Torrent, an advocate for Catalan independence from Spain, was alerted about the hack by researchers working with WhatsApp. The Facebook division is suing NSO for helping government clients hack its customers. Torrent told the Guardian that it seemed clear the \u201cSpanish state\u201d was responsible for the alleged attack.Two other advocates for Catalan independence were allegedly also targeted in what researchers called a \u201cpossible case of domestic political espionage,\u201d the Guardian reports.\u00a0A former NSO employee confirmed to Motherboard that the Spanish government is a client. NSO maintains it only sells its spyware to governments for tracking terrorists and criminals.WhatsApp is suing NSO for allegedly helping to hack approximately 1,400 of its users across 20 countries, including about 100 journalists, dissidents and activists. Amnesty International recently lost a case that would have stripped NSO of its license to export software outside of Israel.Hill happeningsA Democratic lawmaker is calling on Apple and Google to require apps to disclose where they store data.Rep. Stephen F. Lynch (D-Mass.), chairman of the House Oversight Subcommittee on National Security, sent letters to Apple and Google saying that the companies are responsible for making consumers aware of potential security risks posed by the apps.Neither company requires developers to disclose in which countries their data is stored.\u00a0Intelligence officials have warned that foreign apps could be compelled to share U.S. user data depending on local laws. Some lawmakers and officials have pointed to the concern in advocating for restrictions on TikTok and other Chinese apps. (TikTok says it does not store U.S. user data in China.)Lynch also asks the companies to provide details on any instances in which they removed an app for sharing personal data with a foreign government.\u00a0Securing the ballotMajor U.S. Postal Service operational changes could wreak havoc on mail-in voting.The changes, instituted by new Postmaster General Louis DeJoy, include directing carriers to temporarily leave some mail at distribution centers in order to finish their routes more quickly, according to a memo obtained by The Washington Post.\u00a0Mail voting advocates fear that could dramatically slow delivery of ballots and mail ballots and ballot applications. The changes come as the Trump administration has wrested increased control over the struggling agency.\u201cWith our states now reliant on mail voting to continue elections during the pandemic, the destabilizing of the Post office is a direct attack on American democracy itself,\u201d said Rep.

Subscribe today.arrow-rightThe DNC, which is moving its convention online because of the coronavirus pandemic, released a plan Friday for delegates to vote by email for the Democratic presidential nominee and planks in the party\u2019s platform.\u00a0Internet voting presents far fewer risks in this case than it would during a regular election because delegates\u2019 ballots aren\u2019t secret. That means they can verify their votes weren't altered either by hackers or technological snafus and correct any errors after the fact. There\u2019s also no drama about the outcome of the most important vote because former vice president Joe Biden has basically already secured the Democratic nomination.\u00a0ADADBut it still presents numerous opportunities for hackers from Russia or elsewhere to disrupt the voting process, sow confusion about results or use disinformation operations to spread conspiracy theories or gin up hostilities between rival camps supporting Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.).\u00a0And any disruption is likely to spark painful memories of 2016 when information Russia hacked and leaked from the DNC helped wreak havoc on Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign.\u00a0That means the DNC must be hyper-prepared to knock back any allegations of digital interference or rapidly respond to attacks even as it runs a convention unlike any in history.\u00a0\u201cEven if they\u2019re making a prudent decision for public health, this still remains a rich environment for bad actors,\u201d Edward Perez, global director of technology development at OSET Institute, a nonprofit election technology organization, told me. \u201cNo one should lose sight of the fact that a purely electronic return of ballots is very high risk. The DNC needs to wear both hats at the same time: public health and cyber defense.\u201d\u00a0The DNC has been working for months on how to make a virtual convention work during the pandemic.\u00a0The party passed a resolution in May allowing smaller subcommittees to handle in advance some of the more complex votes that usually take place on the convention floor. The remaining votes, including nominating the party\u2019s candidate for president, will go to all convention delegates on a single ballot delivered by email. They\u2019ll have 12 days to fill that ballot out and forward it by email to state party officials between Aug. 3 and Aug. 15. The convention begins Aug. 17.ADADThose emailed ballots will include the delegate\u2019s name and another unique identifier such as a bar code that connects the delegate with his or her vote, the party said in an email to delegates.\u00a0\u201cThe State Parties will be responsible for collecting all ballots from convention delegates as they would if we were conducting votes in person at the convention,\u201d the letter states. \u201cAt the conclusion of voting, each state delegation chair will submit a tally sheet to the Secretary\u2019s Office that formally records the number of votes cast on each item of convention business.\u201d\u00a0There are a number of built-in security safeguards.\u00a0Delegates will receive email updates when their votes are tallied by state party officials and will be able to reach out to those officials to ensure their votes were correctly recorded, a DNC official told me. Delegates will also have the option of voting by phone or conventional mail if they object to email voting or lack Internet, the official said.\u00a0ADADBiden\u2019s and Sanders\u2019s campaigns hosted webinars this weekend outlining the email-voting system for their delegates.\u201cWe want delegates to play their critical role without risk to their personal or the public health,\u201d said the official, who was not authorized to speak publicly about cybersecurity planning. \u201cWe know who all the delegates are. And because the votes are public, we feel confident that we could swiftly fix any problems that arise.\u201d\u00a0The party is also taking measures to ensure that other elements of the convention aren\u2019t disrupted by hackers such as speeches by Biden and top party officials. That includes buying services from cybersecurity companies and \u201cdeploy[ing] redundant and diverse connections and pathways for the programming and infrastructure that supports the programming,\u201d the official said.\u00a0If a traditional election was held this way, election security experts would be sounding alarms about it.\u00a0Indeed, when a handful of states piloted voting on mobile apps earlier this year, it sparked\u00a0so much concern\u00a0that the Department of Homeland Security, the FBI and the Election Assistance Commission sent states a\u00a0guidance memo\u00a0detailing the risks.\u00a0The memo warned that returning ballots using the Internet poses \u201csignificant security risks,\u201d including that hackers could change large numbers of votes, block votes from being recorded or undermine ballot secrecy.ADADThose risks are significantly mitigated when officials aren\u2019t trying to both send a vote over the Internet and keep the voter\u2019s identity secret. But they\u2019re not eliminated.\u00a0\u201cThe stakes are obviously a lot lower in a party convention setting than a general election context where online voting could be hacked to change the results,\u201d Alex Halderman, a University of Michigan election security expert, told me. \u201cBut what\u2019s at stake here is the legitimacy of the process and for that reason security is still very important.\u201dFor example, hackers could prevent a state from forwarding votes to the DNC by locking up its computers with ransomware or overwhelming its networks with Internet traffic. They could also change large numbers of votes by hacking into delegates\u2019 personal computers and mobile devices. That would probably be caught but not before it publicly embarrassed the party. \u00a0ADAD\u201cI\u2019m less concerned about this instance of remote voting because they won\u2019t be anonymous,\u201d Duncan Buell, a University of South Carolina election security expert, told me. \u201cBut [the DNC] should contract with a really good security firm. They should have backups on top of backups and delegates should be checking their votes were cast the way they expected.\u201dThe committee should also be as transparent as possible so there\u2019s less room for Russia or another hostile nation to spread phony rumors that votes aren\u2019t being counted accurately or to otherwise spark fights between delegate factions, Perez said.\u00a0\u201cJust like the DNC attack in 2016, this creates an opportunity for bad actors to cast doubts on results and further divide us as a nation,\u201d he said.\u00a0The keysTrump is taking credit for the U.K.\u2019s decision to ban\u00a0Huawei from its 5G networks.The president\u2019s boast came after the United Kingdom reversed an earlier decision that would have allowed the Chinese firm to build less-sensitive parts of its next-generation phone and Internet system.\u00a0ADAD\u201cI did this myself, for the most part,\u201d Trump said at a news conference. \u201cIt\u2019s a big security risk. I talked many countries out of using it.\u201dBritish Health Secretary Matt Hancock pushed back on Trump\u2019s claims, saying \u201c\u201cAll sorts of people can try to claim credit for the decision but this was based on a technical assessment by the National Cyber Security Centre about how we could have the highest quality 5G systems.\u201dHancock told Sky News: \u201cWell we all know Donald Trump don\u2019t we.\u201dThe U.K. government expects its 5G network to be totally Huawei-free by 2027 because it will be a lengthy and costly process for British companies to shed all their Huawei gear. The decision came after a U.S. ban on foreign firms selling computer chips made with U.S. equipment to Huawei.ADU.S. security hawks hailed the ban as a victory. U.S. officials have long maintained that Huawei could serve as a back door for Chinese spying. Huawei denies the claims.ADSen. Mark R. Warner (D-Va.), vice chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, urged the Trump administration to work with allies \u201con promoting secure and competitively priced alternatives to Huawei equipment.\u201d\u00a0Sen. Roger Wicker (R-Miss.), chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, also weighed in:The decision could steer other European countries toward banning Huawei or seriously limiting its role in their 5G networks, Ellen Nakashima and William Booth report.\u00a0ADHuawei, meanwhile, blamed the U.K. decision on politics. \u201cThis disappointing decision is bad news for anyone in the U.K. with a mobile phone,\u201d a company spokesman told Reuters. \u201cRegrettably our future in the U.K. has become politicized, this is about U.S. trade policy and not security.\u201d Some trade groups have also criticized the move, saying the timeline could hurt U.K. consumers.A Texas judge denied a request to allow voters with the coronavirus to cast ballots by email in yesterday\u2019s primary runoff.The last-minute request by Harris County officials came on behalf of thousands of quarantined people,\u00a0Zach Despart at the Houston Chronicle reports. An Austin resident in a similar bind had to get a last minute doctor\u2019s note that allowed her to have someone else return her ballot with minutes to spare, the Texas Tribune\u2019s Alexa Ura reports.\u00a0ADThe incidents shows the sort of thorny challenges that are likely to face officials in November as they attempt to run elections in the thick of the pandemic.Meanwhile, some Dallas County voters had their ballots returned to them because of issues with preprinted envelopes, the U.S. Postal Service confirmed Monday. It\u2019s unclear how many voters were affected and if they ultimately risked catching the virus to vote in person. \u201cWe reviewed this issue with the Dallas County Board of Elections before the election as well as last week, advising them how to correct the problem,\u201d\u00a0USPS\u00a0told Dallas news station WFAA in a statement.Other primary and runoff elections went relatively smoothly yesterday in Alabama and Maine.\u00a0Spain is the latest nation accused of using spyware to go after political opponents.Roger Torrent, the speaker of a regional parliament in Spain\u2019s Catalonia region, alleges the Spanish government used controversial spyware from the Israeli company NSO Group to hack his phone, the Guardian reports.\u00a0Torrent, an advocate for Catalan independence from Spain, was alerted about the hack by researchers working with WhatsApp. The Facebook division is suing NSO for helping government clients hack its customers. Torrent told the Guardian that it seemed clear the \u201cSpanish state\u201d was responsible for the alleged attack.Two other advocates for Catalan independence were allegedly also targeted in what researchers called a \u201cpossible case of domestic political espionage,\u201d the Guardian reports.\u00a0A former NSO employee confirmed to Motherboard that the Spanish government is a client. NSO maintains it only sells its spyware to governments for tracking terrorists and criminals.WhatsApp is suing NSO for allegedly helping to hack approximately 1,400 of its users across 20 countries, including about 100 journalists, dissidents and activists. Amnesty International recently lost a case that would have stripped NSO of its license to export software outside of Israel.Hill happeningsA Democratic lawmaker is calling on Apple and Google to require apps to disclose where they store data.Rep. Stephen F. Lynch (D-Mass.), chairman of the House Oversight Subcommittee on National Security, sent letters to Apple and Google saying that the companies are responsible for making consumers aware of potential security risks posed by the apps.Neither company requires developers to disclose in which countries their data is stored.\u00a0Intelligence officials have warned that foreign apps could be compelled to share U.S. user data depending on local laws. Some lawmakers and officials have pointed to the concern in advocating for restrictions on TikTok and other Chinese apps. (TikTok says it does not store U.S. user data in China.)Lynch also asks the companies to provide details on any instances in which they removed an app for sharing personal data with a foreign government.\u00a0Securing the ballotMajor U.S. Postal Service operational changes could wreak havoc on mail-in voting.The changes, instituted by new Postmaster General Louis DeJoy, include directing carriers to temporarily leave some mail at distribution centers in order to finish their routes more quickly, according to a memo obtained by The Washington Post.\u00a0Mail voting advocates fear that could dramatically slow delivery of ballots and mail ballots and ballot applications. The changes come as the Trump administration has wrested increased control over the struggling agency.\u201cWith our states now reliant on mail voting to continue elections during the pandemic, the destabilizing of the Post office is a direct attack on American democracy itself,\u201d said Rep.

Subscribe today.arrow-rightThat could be an electoral disaster for the president, who\u2019s locked in a difficult reelection race \u2014 especially if the coronavirus pandemic makes it difficult or risky for many of his supporters to vote in person.\u00a0The issue was already dividing Trump from Republican election officials who have generally joined Democrats in trying to vastly expand mail voting during the pandemic so people don't have to risk their health to cast ballots. Now it\u2019s splitting him from his own party\u2019s strategists.\u00a0ADADThe president\u2019s criticism of mail voting \u201cdoes reduce the likelihood of Republicans embracing this process,\u201d a senior GOP strategist told my colleagues. \u201cEspecially for older, more rural voters, that could be important for Republicans getting out the vote in 2020. I don\u2019t want \u2018I will not vote by mail\u2019 to become a political statement. But it may be too late.\u201d\u00a0The rift is especially noteworthy because voting by mail has not historically been a partisan issue. Many right-leaning states, such as Utah and Arizona, have embraced the process with large percentages of their populations casting mail ballots. Many left-leaning states, including Massachusetts and New York, have shied away from it.\u00a0The disparities between Republicans and Democrats are unmistakable.\u00a0About twice as many Virginia Democrats applied for absentee ballots compared to Republicans in the state\u2019s June 23 primaries. That\u2019s despite the fact Republicans had a competitive Senate primary to vote in while Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.) was running unopposed for his party\u2019s nomination.\u00a0ADADIn Kentucky\u2019s June 23 primary, about 90 percent of Democrats cast their ballots before Election Day, either by mail voting or early voting. Just 80 percent of Republicans did so.\u00a0In Georgia\u2019s June 9 primaries, about 60,000 fewer Republicans cast ballots by mail compared to Democrats despite a majority of Georgia voters traditionally voting Republican.\u00a0Republicans are also expressing widespread distrust of mail voting.\u00a0A Washington Post-ABC News poll\u00a0in late May found 87 percent of Democrats think it should be easier to vote by mail compared to just 33 percent of Republicans.\u00a0That\u2019s despite the fact that fraud risks from voting by mail are, in fact, exceptionally low.\u00a0ADThe few prominent cases have been easily discovered. That includes an effort launched by GOP operatives in North Carolina in 2018 and a recent case that led to criminal charges against members of the Paterson, N.J., city council. Council members there are elected on a nonpartisan basis.\u00a0A\u00a0Washington Post analysis\u00a0recently found possible voter fraud cases in states that vote primarily by mail accounted for just 0.0025 percent of ballots in 2016 and 2018 \u00a0\u2014 or about one out of every 39,000.\u00a0Republicans have also lashed out at their own representatives when they embraced voting by mail or urged them to cast ballots that way.\u00a0In one dramatic example, a Republican senator seeking reelection sent a mass text urging constituents to apply for absentee ballots. The senator got a reply saying, \u201cNo one should legitimize this mail-in voting hogwash,\u201d my colleagues report.\u00a0ADADSkepticism about mail voting was also on display in primaries yesterday in New Jersey.P. Kenneth Burns with Philadelphia\u2019s WHYY public radio station:\u00a0The New Jersey primary was held almost entirely by mail without any major problems. Results in some races could take a week or longer because of the high volume of absentee votes, but winners have already been declared in some high profile races. That includes former Vice President Joe Biden, who's already the party's presumptive nominee, winning the state's Democratic presidential primary.\u00a0Trump hasn\u2019t slowed his assaults \u2013 despite voting by mail himself in Florida this year.\u00a0In a June 2 tweet the president pointed to the Paterson case and claimed that \u201cMail-In Ballots will lead to massive electoral fraud and a rigged 2020 Election.\u201dThe president also regularly rants about mail ballots and voter fraud in the Oval Office, one former senior administration official told my colleagues, because \u201cone, he truly believes it, and two, it gives him an out if he loses.\u201dADADBiden, meanwhile, has urged states to expand mail voting and early voting during the pandemic. He voted by mail in Delaware\u2019s primary, which was also held yesterday and where he was also declared the winner.\u00a0NBC News\u2019s Mike Memoli:Even government health officials are carefully disputing the president\u2019s claims.\u00a0The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention quietly issued updated guidance June 22 urging voters to consider alternatives to in-person voting on Election Day including voting by mail, Michelle Ye Hee Lee reports.\u00a0The CDC circulated the updated guidance to election officials in June but didn\u2019t promote it publicly. It was shared more widely yesterday by Sens. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and Patty Murray (D-Wash.), who had urged the CDC to update its guidance.ADKlobuchar led a push by Senate Democrats to invest $3.6 billion in expanding mail voting and other reforms to ensure the November election is safe and secure. Those efforts have been blocked by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) who opposes federal mandates on elections.\u00a0AD\u201cIn the midst of this pandemic, voters should not need to choose between their health and casting their ballots,\u201d Klobuchar said. \u201cThis guidance from the CDC makes it clear that the government must take steps to protect voters.\u201dThe keysFBI Director Christopher A. Wray launched a broadside against China for hacking U.S. companies and coronavirus researchers.\u00a0\u201cAt this very moment, China is working to compromise American health-care organizations, pharmaceutical companies and academic institutions conducting essential covid research,\u201d Wray said during an address at the conservative Hudson Institute think tank.ADFBI agents open up a new counterintelligence investigation against China \u201cabout every 10 hours,\u201d Wray said. Such investigations have also increased 1,300 percent in the past decade, he said, as Devlin Barrett reports.ADThe speech comes as Trump and officials throughout his administration have sharpened their criticism of China during the pandemic.\u201cChina is engaged in a whole-of-state effort to become the world\u2019s only superpower, by any means necessary,\u201d the FBI director said. \u201cThe sad fact is that instead of engaging in the hard slog of innovation, China often steals American intellectual property and then uses it to compete against the very American companies it victimized.\u201dMicrosoft disrupted a massive hacking campaign that took advantage of the pandemic.The fraud campaign targeted millions of Microsoft users across 62 countries, the company said in a blog post. Many of the attacks were aimed at conning people who were working from home into wiring money to accounts they thought belonged to company executives but were actually controlled by the criminal hacking ring, Alyza Sebenius at Bloomberg News reports.\u00a0ADADMicrosoft won a judicial order that allowed it to seize misleading Web domains the hackers were using\u00a0to steal people\u2019s usernames, passwords and other information.\u00a0\u201cIn cases where criminals suddenly and massively scale their activity and move quickly to adapt their techniques to evade Microsoft\u2019s built-in defensive mechanisms, additional measures such as the legal action filed in this case are necessary,\u201d the company said.It\u2019s rare for a company to take that legal route. One of the most prominent examples came last year when Microsoft seized domains used by Iranian hackers to target U.S. government agencies and businesses.\u00a0German police seized a server holding leaked data from U.S. police agencies.\u00a0The data trove called BlueLeaks was posted by the group Distributed Denial of Secrets last month amid mass protests over the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis and other police violence against African Americans.

After testing\u00a0it on the 400 million 4G customers he has in India, he\u2019ll offer it to other markets.\u00a0The news18.com website, also controlled by Ambani, called the technology\u00a0a \u201cHuawei-killer,\u201d and noted that\u00a0U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had praised Jio as a clean network for not using the Chinese firm\u2019s gear.ADADWhile details of Ambani\u2019s 5G prowess and the markets he hopes to target are still fuzzy, the planned\u00a0assault against handset makers is clearer.\u00a0Alphabet Inc. CEO Sundar Pichai made a virtual appearance at\u00a0the Reliance AGM and pledged  $4.5\u00a0billion for a 7.7% stake in Jio and a chance to build an Android operating system. The\u00a0cheap smartphones running it will\u00a0migrate 350 million Indians who still use feature phones to mobile internet. But how much customization will\u00a0Google be\u00a0comfortable with? If it\u2019s a lot,\u00a0the phone may be affordable\u00a0but tied to Jio\u2019s apps. Too little, and the\u00a0pricing may be unattractive. Somewhere\u00a0in between those extremes, it\u2019s a\u00a0threat to Xiaomi Corp.\u00a0As Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Anthea Lai notes, India accounted for 35% of the Chinese vendor\u2019s smartphone shipments last year.\u00a0One more thing is now evident: WhatsApp, the messaging system of Facebook Inc., which has given Jio\u00a0$5.7 billion for a near-10% stake, will drive commerce. The\u00a0blueprint is again Chinese. Whatsapp\u2019s popularity, and its ability to handle payments in real time, make it a perfect platform for Ambani to build a super-app like Tencent Holdings Ltd.\u2019s WeChat, connecting brands with customers.The 300,000 Reliance investors who watched the AGM on JioMeet, Ambani\u2019s cloud-conferencing clone of\u00a0Zoom Video Communications Inc., probably found the sharp pivot away from hydrocarbons a bit too much to take. Ambani dropped enough hints that last year\u2019s plan to sell 20% of his mainstay oils-to-chemicals business to Saudi Aramco was now unlikely. Given the Covid-19 situation,\u00a0writing a $15 billion check would be a further strain on Aramco\u2019s\u00a0$75 billion-a-year dividend payout, as my colleague David Fickling has  noted. Still, Reliance shares fell 3.8% after Ambani said the unit will be spun off and seek new investors.ADADReliance may get saddled with a permanent discount\u00a0as a holding company of digital, retail and hydrocarbon\u00a0assets, but\u00a0the empire could as easily command a premium as India\u2019s undeclared\u00a0national champion.\u00a0Just as\u00a0Ambani wants to emulate several successful\u00a0Chinese firms at once, the country\u2019s policy makers want the same thing for the broader economy: make India the world\u2019s\u00a0factory, by lodging it\u00a0into the growing chasm between the West\u00a0and China. But neither the physical infrastructure, nor most of India Inc.\u2019s balance sheet, is\u00a0ready. After the pandemic, everything from a broken financial sector to grossly inadequate worker housing, healthcare and social security will compete for fiscal sops from a government trying to retain\u00a0its tenuous investment-grade rating.\u00a0Reliance\u2019s\u00a0capital-raising spree has made it free of net debt. It\u2019s willing to run with Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s buy-Indian agenda.\u00a0Its grocery business would lift\u00a0farmer incomes by direct purchasing. Jio\u2019s\u00a0cheap cloud services\u00a0for small businesses\u00a0would\u00a0help them digitize. By\u00a0connecting to JioMart, a virtual store,\u00a0neighborhood shops\u00a0could outgrow\u00a0their limited shelf space,\u00a0Ambani said. JioMeet could become as a virtual classroom to the country. Reliance\u00a0also wants to supply\u00a0cleaner auto fuels to end\u00a0Indian cities\u2019\u00a0crippling pollution problem.ADADAs India has learned from China, economic policy\u00a0that aligns itself with the expansion of a few large capitalists is more manageable \u2014 and produces faster results \u2014 than one that has to play referee to free and open competition.\u00a0By the time that throws up a winner, Vietnam and Bangladesh might corner the export opportunity that India wants to claim.\u00a0India\u2019s competitive landscape would\u00a0have been broadened had Google\u2019s\u00a0Pichai bought a stake in Jio\u2019s telecom competitor\u00a0Vodafone Idea Ltd., a plan it was considering, according to a  Financial Times report in May. Although that deal is probably now dead, Pichai might still pitch his own tent separately from Ambani\u2019s.\u00a0So\u00a0far, he\u2019s only decided on the handset partnership with Jio.\u00a0There\u2019s\u00a0still plenty left in the  $10 billion kitty he set aside for India this week.There\u2019s also\u00a0Amazon.com Inc.\u2019s Jeff Bezos. It will be surprising if, after committing $5.5 billion to the country, he bows out.\u00a0As for Ambani, he still has to demonstrate that one company can be India\u2019s answer to everything, from Zoom and Tencent to Huawei and Xiaomi, while also being a large telco like Verizon Communications Inc.ADADThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Andy Mukherjee is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering industrial companies and financial services.

The show it initially distributed for this weekend\u2019s show featured an interview with Judy Mikovits, maker of the widely discredited \u201cPlandemic\u201d video, and her lawyer, Larry Klayman.ADADMikovits, an anti-vaccine activist, said she believed that Fauci manufactured the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 and shipped it to China. There has been no evidence that the virus was produced in a lab, much less any of Fauci\u2019s involvement.Bolling did not push back on the claim, or show any evidence of checking its veracity. He followed up with a segment interviewing radiologist Dr. Nicole Saphier, a Fox News contributor, who said she thought Fauci \u201cin no way, shape or form has been involved in the manufacture of this virus.\u201dDuring the segment, first revealed by Media Matters for America, a chyron on the bottom of the screen read \u201cDid Dr. Fauci create coronavirus?\u201dADBolling told CNN Business that he wasn\u2019t even aware of the \u201cPlandemic\u201d video before his bookers arranged for Mikovits\u2019 appearance.

Online platforms Facebook, YouTube and Twitter took actions to slow its distribution.Kelly McBride, a senior vice president and ethics expert for the Poynter Institute, a journalism think tank, said Saturday that such controversial theories should only be presented if accompanied by thorough reporting on their accuracy.AD\u201cOne has the responsibility to vet the information that they\u2019re putting in front of an audience,\u201d McBride said. \u201cThere\u2019s no way to put information out like that responsibly because it\u2019s so far-fetched.\u201dBefore pulling the episode, Sinclair had tweeted that it did not endorse Mikovits\u2019 theory.

Subscribe today.arrow-rightHis new dystopian vision, with militant and extreme language not typical in American politics, marks a sharp departure from Trump\u2019s previous effort to cast Biden as \u201cSleepy Joe,\u201d an establishment politician with deteriorating mental abilities. It marks the latest effort, orchestrated by Trump\u2019s advisers, to shift the conversation from rising coronavirus infections and deteriorating public support for the president\u2019s pandemic response.In new advertising, tweets and public statements that began to appear earlier this month, Trump has argued that the presumptive Democratic nominee is a harbinger of chaos and destruction, depicting a fantastical scarecrow largely divorced from reality.ADAD\u201cJoe Biden and the Radical Left want to Abolish Police, Abolish ICE, Abolish Bail, Abolish Suburbs, Abolish the 2nd Amendment \u2014 and Abolish the American Way of Life. No one will be SAFE in Joe Biden\u2019s America!\u201d Trump tweeted Wednesday. In fact, Biden opposes calls to abolish police or U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, seeks new gun regulations under current judicial interpretations of the Constitution and sees the nation\u2019s suburban voters, especially women, as a core part of his political base.Rancor between scientists and Trump allies threatens pandemic response as cases surgeTrump\u2019s tweeted language, along with similar comments by him Tuesday in the Rose Garden, appear to be lifted directly from an internal White House document officials said was circulated in the building days earlier. In two concise pages, the document sent by White House senior adviser Stephen Miller laid out dozens of bullet-pointed attacks on Biden, along with a brief summary of positive points that describe Trump\u2019s \u201cvision for the future.\u201dThe author of many of Trump\u2019s most pugilistic public statements, Miller has raised concerns to other White House aides that the campaign\u2019s messaging has not been tough enough on Biden, officials said, and a cadre of White House officials have begun working on campaign issues through their private email accounts and text message chains.ADADIn the talking points he distributed, Biden\u2019s elevation to the White House was described as an event that would \u201csurrender America and its citizens to the violent left-wing mob,\u201d \u201cimport terrorists,\u201d and \u201callow left-wing fascists to destroy America.\u201d In an echo of the speech Trump delivered at Mount Rushmore on July 3, the talking points alleged that Biden will empower \u201cthe mob to rip down every statue, vilify our heroes, erase our history\u201d and let radicals indoctrinate our children. (Biden launched his campaign with a video quoting the Declaration of Independence and has condemned the removal of statues that do not commemorate the Confederacy.)The document also includes false, and even contradictory, policy attacks that have long been a staple of the Trump campaign\u2019s digital advertising.\u201cBiden will impose a socialist takeover of health care,\u201d the talking points document reads. \u201cHe will massively cut Medicare and Social Security.\u201d (Biden, who has fought against Medicare-for-all, supports adding a public Medicare option for those without private health insurance and increasing funding for Social Security.)ADADMiller himself pushed the harsher line in an appearance Wednesday on Lou Dobbs\u2019s Fox Business show, where he spoke about the Central American gang MS-13 and charged that Biden and former president Barack Obama \u201cunleashed these killers into our communities\u201d and \u201cnever apologized.\u201d The Obama administration prioritized deportation of undocumented criminals and gang members.Miller framed the election in nearly apocalyptic terms. \u201cThat\u2019s the choice everyone faces: Public safety under this president or lawless mayhem under the radical left,\u201d he said.The White House declined to comment on the document and the president\u2019s rhetorical shift.Similar talking points have since been broadly embraced by federal officials and Republican operatives in their public comments, bringing a broader audience to an argument that was previously confined to conservative media, like Tucker Carlson\u2019s prime-time Fox News program, where Democrats are regularly described as people who \u201chate\u201d and \u201cdespise\u201d their own country.ADADHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) has begun arguing that Democrats want to \u201cdeface, destroy and dismantle our country,\u201d in a clear signal to House campaigns. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Thursday in a speech that \u201cthe very core of what it means to be an American, indeed the American way of life itself, is under attack\u201d from within the country.The effort recalls some of the controversial rhetoric that Trump embraced in his 2016 campaign, when he made calls for imprisoning his opponent, Hillary Clinton. But advisers to Biden don\u2019t believe such a strategy can work again in a time of such acute national crises. They said the claims are so obviously false and outlandish as to not be credible, and they point to the fact that Biden begins the general election with higher approval ratings than Clinton.\u201cPredicating this \u2018new,\u2019 incoherent nonmessage on \u2018safety\u2019 or \u2018radicalism\u2019 isn\u2019t strategic \u2014 it\u2019s unstable projection and desperation incarnate,\u201d Biden campaign spokesman Andrew Bates said. \u201cThis is another tragic reminder that in a moment of unprecedented crisis, when we need real leadership more than ever, we are saddled with an unhinged commander in chief.\u201dADADTrump campaign advisers maintain that the president\u2019s recent statements are accurate depictions of Biden, because they point out parts of his past record or the effective results of Biden\u2019s policy push. Biden has supported cuts to Social Security and Medicare in the past. He supports less aggressive immigration enforcement policies, and he would change qualified immunity for police officers, which they argue would bankrupt law enforcement.\u201cI hate to break it to Joe Biden, but he has a 47-year record and I am afraid he is stuck with it,\u201d said Tim Murtaugh, the Trump campaign\u2019s communications director, who also argued that Biden would be further manipulated in office. \u201cBiden is an empty vessel here. He is a Trojan horse for Bernie Sanders and the radical left agenda because he cannot stand up to them.\u201dBill Stepien, Trump\u2019s newly appointed campaign manager, views a ramped up focus on attacking Biden as a primary goal, according to people familiar with his thinking who like others spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe private strategy discussions.ADAD\u201cThere are two reasons an incumbent wins. One, you\u2019re doing a good job. Two, the opponent has been discredited as a better alternative,\u201d said Mike DuHaime, a GOP strategist and close friend of Stepien. \u201cThe first one is not really up to the campaign. It\u2019s up to the president and the White House. Second, the campaign has some level of control over and needs to do a better job.\u201dTrump campaign adviser Jason Miller, no relation to Stephen, has also been pushing the messaging internally, sending out morning memos to Trump campaign advisers, supporters and surrogates to drive the message. A campaign official familiar with the effort said that both Millers participated in an effort in late June and early July to improve the campaign messaging.The advisers seized on a July 8 joint policy statement by the Biden campaign and senior advisers to Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) to claim that Biden is abandoning his moderate record to become a tool for the left. They have also focused on a July 8 interview by Biden, where he said that surplus military supplies going to local police departments had the ill effect of making them \u201cbecome the enemy\u201d for communities they protect and said he supported redirecting some police funding.ADADSince then, the Trump campaign has earned the ire of fact-checkers by claiming that Biden wants to defund the police or that he considers police \u201cthe enemy,\u201d neither of which is true. The Trump campaign has nonetheless spent nearly $14 million since July\u00a02, according to a Democratic ad tracker, to air a television spot that suggests police departments won\u2019t respond to 911 calls if Biden is elected.Trump has occasionally struggled to deliver the new message. In an interview set to air on Fox News Sunday, the president claims that the Biden and Sanders statement included plans to \u201cdefund the police.\u201d It does not, but Trump nonetheless called for a temporary stop to the interview to check the document.\u201cYou won\u2019t be safe in Joe Biden\u2019s America. Your family won\u2019t be safe, your job won\u2019t be safe and even your words and ideas won\u2019t be safe,\u201d one recent Jason Miller internal email read.ADADThe sharpened talking points have given the Trump campaign a more unified argument, after months of struggling with how to respond to the viral pandemic, the economic crisis and the nationwide protests against police brutality.For much of June, Trump moved, often confusingly, between praising and condemning protests over racial injustice. His campaign\u2019s television advertising praised his response to the viral pandemic, even as he prevaricated on wearing masks to prevent transmission and urged the country to reopen among rising infection rates in many states.The talking points document distributed by Stephen Miller lays out a direct message on the coronavirus: \u201cOur strategy is to shelter the vulnerable while allowing the young and healthy to return to work.\u201dIn recent weeks, federal health officials have stepped up their warnings about infections among young and healthy people that has spread to more vulnerable populations.\u201cNone of us really anticipated the amount of community spread that began in really our 18 to 35-year-old age group,\u201d Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus response coordinator, said on Tuesday. \u201cWe right now have really significant cases in people under 45.\u201dThe document also claims the United States has a lower fatality rate from covid-19 than France, Italy, the United Kingdom, Spain, the Netherlands, Japan, Denmark, Germany and Finland.According to Johns Hopkins University Coronovirus Resource Center, the United States has the second highest number of deaths as a share of population among the 20 countries most affected by the coronavirus, behind only the United Kingdom. When measured by the number of deaths per confirmed cases, the U.S. has the ninth highest rate in the world.Recent polling has shown a sharp deterioration in public approval for Trump\u2019s handling of the pandemic, as the number of infections and deaths have begun to rise again nationwide. A July Washington Post-ABC News poll found that 38 percent of Americans approve of his handling of the outbreak, down from 46 percent in May and 51 percent in March.Trump advisers have urged him to address the recent spike in cases more directly, and he recently pivoted on the question of wearing a mask, by wearing one in public and saying he did not mind the way he looked. White House counselor Kellyanne Conway said Friday on \u201cFox and Friends\u201d that Trump should start appearing again at daily coronavirus briefings from the White House.Those briefings stopped after advisers told the president that some of his comments, including his suggestion that doctors find a way to inject disinfectant into people to kill the virus, were hurting his public image.Campaign advisers say the operation is still refining a positive case for Trump\u2019s reelection. At recent events, the president has listed off a push for school choice, improved health care, a tougher stand against China, more conservative judges and continued focus on building the economy. The Stephen Miller document adds to several platforms that echo the negative case Trump is trying to make against Biden, including defense of police and keeping borders secure.Among the Trump visions for the future, the document lists this one: \u201cDefend our noble history and the American way of life.\u201d\n\n\n\n", "comment": "5.4k Comments", "topic": "Politics"}, {"cover": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/R6IFFXGKBYI6VITSA7PPRLUYUY.jpghttps://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/R6IFFXGKBYI6VITSA7PPRLUYUY.jpg", "title": "Trump defends bungled handling of coronavirus with falsehoods and dubious claims", "date": "Jul 19, 2020", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-defends-bungled-handling-of-coronavirus-with-falsehoods-and-dubious-claims/2020/07/19/1b57cb3e-c9e6-11ea-91f1-28aca4d833a0_story.html", "keyword": "China and Security", "website": "the Washington Post", "author": "Philip RuckerFelicia Sonmez", "content": "President Trump said in an interview aired Sunday that the rising number of U.S. deaths from the coronavirus \u201cis what it is,\u201d defended his fumbled management of the pandemic with a barrage of dubious and false claims, and revealed his lack of understanding about the fundamental science of how the virus spreads and infects people.Support our journalism. Subscribe today.arrow-rightMaking one of his biggest media appearances in months \u2014 an hour-long, sit-down interview with \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d anchor Chris Wallace \u2014 Trump was visibly rattled and at times hostile as he struggled to answer for his administration\u2019s failure to contain the coronavirus, which has claimed more than 137,000 lives in the United States.On a range of other topics, including the racial justice movement and the Confederate flag, the president positioned himself firmly outside the political mainstream. And Trump suggested he might not accept the results of November\u2019s general election should he lose because he predicted without evidence that \u201cmail-in voting is going to rig the election.\u201dADADIn a season of remarkable public appearances by a politically wounded president, the Wallace interview was still extraordinary, in part because of the volley of false claims by Trump and aggressive, real-time fact-checking by his questioner.As the coronavirus crisis spins out of control, Trump issues directives \u2014 but still no clear planTrump \u2014 who aides say no longer attends coronavirus task force meetings because he does not have time \u2014 showed himself to be particularly misinformed about the basics of the virus that has been ravaging the nation for more than four months.Confronted by Wallace with a chart showing that the number of coronavirus cases last week more than doubled from the spring peak in April, Trump replied: \u201cIf we didn\u2019t test, you wouldn\u2019t be able to show that chart. If we tested half as much, those numbers would be down.\u201dBy the president\u2019s logic, that assumes people contract the virus only if they test positive, ignoring the fact that many people are asymptomatic carriers and unknowingly spread the contagion without taking a test or being reported.Wallace later explained to Trump that the number of tests has increased by 37 percent but the number of cases has shot up by 194 percent. Trump replied, \u201cMany of those cases are young people that would heal in a day. They have the sniffles and we put it down as a test. Many of them \u2014 don\u2019t forget, I guess it\u2019s like 99.7 percent, people are going to get better and [in] many cases, they\u2019re going to get better very quickly.\u201dADADThough people in their 20s and 30s, who make up a growing proportion of cases, have been hospitalized at a lower rate than older people, many still have suffered severe illness and some have died.Former vice president Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, reacted to Trump\u2019s interview in a statement Sunday: \u201cThe past six months have proven again and again that it\u2019s Donald Trump who doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s talking about when it comes to COVID-19 .\u2009.\u2009. When it comes to the coronavirus, you can\u2019t believe a word he says.\u201dA growing number of Americans disapprove of Trump\u2019s handling of the pandemic. A new Washington Post-ABC News poll found 38 percent approve of his performance and 60\u00a0percent disapprove. The same survey found Biden leading Trump by double digits nationally, 55 percent to 40 percent.ADADIn an attempt to regain their political footing, Trump and his aides recently have sought to divert attention from the soaring number of coronavirus cases by focusing on the rate of deaths. In the Fox interview, Trump falsely asserted, \u201cI think we have one of the lowest mortality rates in the world.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not true, sir,\u201d Wallace replied. \u201cWe had 900 deaths on a single day just this week.\u201dTrump shouted to aides hovering nearby: \u201cCan you please get the mortality rates?\u201d White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany quickly presented Trump with data she said was from Deborah Birx, a physician and the White House coronavirus response coordinator, backing up his claim.AD\u201cNumber one low mortality fatality rates,\u201d Trump claimed.At that point, Fox interrupted the taped interview for Wallace to explain to his viewers that according to data from Johns Hopkins University, the United States ranked seventh among 20 countries in mortality rate, worse than Brazil and Russia. The White House relied on European data showing Italy and Spain doing worse than the United States but Brazil and South Korea doing better. The White House chart did not include Russia and other countries doing better, according to Wallace.When Wallace pointed out that coronavirus deaths in the United States were still about 1,000 a day, Trump said: \u201cIt came from China. They should\u2019ve never let it escape, they should\u2019ve never let it out, but it is what it is.\u201dADADTrump then hypothesized that the case count in Europe was so much lower than in the United States because \u201cthey don\u2019t test,\u201d as opposed to a sign that the virus was not as rampant there because their countries had largely contained it.By conducting mass testing, Trump said, \u201cWe are creating trouble for the fake news to come along and say, \u2018Oh, we have more cases.\u2019\u2009\u201dTrump reiterated his long-held theory that the virus would somehow \u201cdisappear,\u201d a claim not grounded in scientific fact.\u201cI will be right eventually,\u201d Trump told Wallace. \u201cYou know I said, \u2018It\u2019s going to disappear.\u2019 I\u2019ll say it again. It\u2019s going to disappear, and I\u2019ll be right .\u2009.\u2009. You know why? Because I\u2019ve been right probably more than anybody else.\u201dRancor between scientists and Trump allies threatens pandemic response as cases surgeTrump used his Fox interview to continue the White House\u2019s remarkable assault on some of the scientists and public health professionals spearheading the government\u2019s response. The president called Anthony S. Fauci, the nation\u2019s top infectious-disease expert, \u201ca little bit of an alarmist.\u201d He noted that Fauci had argued internally against restricting travel from China, which Trump ordered in late January, and had initially said all Americans did not need to wear masks, before there was scientific evidence that doing so would help slow the spread.Trump also challenged the assessment of Robert Redfield, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, who again warned last week that the pandemic could worsen this fall when flu season begins, reflecting widespread scientific consensus. \u201cI don\u2019t think he knows,\u201d Trump said of Redfield.Trump sought to draw a hard line on the coronavirus relief bill, saying it must include a payroll tax cut and liability protections for businesses, as lawmakers prepare to plunge into negotiations over unemployment benefits and other key provisions in coming days. Republican leaders are largely dismissive of the idea of cutting payroll taxes, which fund Social Security, while siding with Trump on the liability issue.ADADThe Fox interview was conducted outdoors on a White House patio on an oppressively hot day \u2014 the president\u2019s choice, as Wallace twice noted. Trump joked that he wanted to see Wallace sweat, but it was the president\u2019s face that glistened with sweat as the Fox anchor engaged him on a wide range of other topics, including the race and justice issues that convulsed the country. Trump declined to say whether he found the Confederate flag offensive and defended what many Americans view as a symbol of slavery, racial oppression and treason.\u201cWhen people proudly have their Confederate flags, they\u2019re not talking about racism,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThey love their flag. It represents the South. They like the South. People right now like the South.\u201dWallace followed up: \u201cSo you\u2019re not offended by it?\u201dAD\u201cWell, I\u2019m not offended either by Black Lives Matter,\u201d Trump replied. \u201cThat\u2019s freedom of speech. You know, the whole thing with cancel culture, we can\u2019t cancel our whole history. We can\u2019t forget that the North and the South fought. We have to remember that, otherwise we\u2019ll end up fighting again.\u201dADTrump also teased the possibility that he might not accept the election results if he were to lose, jeopardizing America\u2019s tradition of a peaceful transfer of power between presidents.When Wallace asked Trump whether he considers himself a \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cgracious\u201d loser, the president replied that he doesn\u2019t like to lose. Then he added, \u201cYou don\u2019t know until you see. It depends. I think mail-in voting is going to rig the election. I really do.\u201dFor weeks now, Trump has claimed without evidence that the rise in voting by mail in many states makes voting susceptible to widespread fraud.AD\u201cAre you suggesting that you might not accept the results of the election?\u201d Wallace asked.\u201cNo,\u201d Trump responded. \u201cI have to see.\u201dLater in the interview, pressed on whether he will accept the results, Trump again declined to say. \u201cI have to see,\u201d he said.ADBiden campaign spokesman Andrew Bates responded to Trump\u2019s remarks in a statement: \u201cThe American people will decide this election. And the United States government is perfectly capable of escorting trespassers out of the White House.\u201dTrump sought to portray Biden as mentally vacant, telling Wallace that he did not want to characterize his opponent as \u201csenile\u201d but positing that \u201cJoe doesn\u2019t know he\u2019s alive\u201d and is \u201cmentally shot.\u201dTrump then challenged Biden to a cognitive test, which the president characterized as exceedingly difficult. During a physical exam in 2018, Trump took the Montreal Cognitive Assessment \u2014 which includes animal pictures and other simple queries aimed at detecting mild cognitive impairment such as dementia \u2014 and has regularly boasted about it since.Wallace told Trump that he tried the test himself after hearing the president brag about passing it. Wallace said \u201cit\u2019s not the hardest test,\u201d adding that one of the questions on the version he took was to properly identify a picture of an elephant.\u201cI\u2019ll bet you couldn\u2019t even answer the last five questions,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI\u2019ll bet you couldn\u2019t. They get very hard, the last five questions.\u201d\u201cWell, one of them was count back from 100 by seven,\u201d Wallace said, adding: \u201cNinety-three.\u201d\n\n\n\n", "comment": "6.9k Comments", "topic": "Politics"}, {"cover": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/QSZOPVWHIII6VKBFQ4RAATSBKA.jpghttps://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/QSZOPVWHIII6VKBFQ4RAATSBKA.jpg", "title": "Europe struck down its data deal with the U.S. Facebook, other companies are in trouble.", "date": "Jul 17, 2020", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/07/17/europe-struck-down-its-data-deal-with-us-facebook-other-companies-are-trouble/", "keyword": "China and Security", "website": "the Washington Post", "author": "", "content": "Thursday, in a landmark decision, the European Union\u2019s top court invalidated the Privacy Shield, a key mechanism that businesses use for transferring personal data across the Atlantic. It also set clear limits on the other main tool that businesses use to transfer data: standard contractual clauses (SCCs). The Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) found that the Privacy Shield did not protect European citizens against U.S. surveillance and suggested that contractual clauses would work only for transfers of data to jurisdictions that had equivalent privacy protections to the European Union. This means trouble for Facebook and other similar companies that rely on these data flows as part of their business model, as well as other big companies.Here are three key takeaways from the ruling.Support our journalism. Subscribe today.arrow-rightBusinesses can expect a turbulent timeADADThe CJEU was deciding on a case that most people are calling Schrems II \u2014 after the Austrian privacy activist Max Schrems. The court ruled on the validity of the Privacy Shield, the U.S.-E.U. agreement which over 5,300 companies use to send sensitive data across the Atlantic, including tech giants such as Facebook, Twitter, Google and Amazon; and SCCs, which contractually oblige companies to follow E.U.-level privacy standards once they transfer personal data outside Europe.The court annulled Privacy Shield, arguing that U.S. law does not limit surveillance programs to what is strictly necessary and that exposing the data of Europeans to U.S. intelligence agencies violates their privacy rights. In addition, the court found that the system offers insufficient legal recourse for Europeans to challenge U.S. practices. With transatlantic relations severely strained, the European Union and the United States face the daunting task of finding a new arrangement that satisfies the court\u2019s concerns without disrupting the transatlantic economy. Recent history will loom large over these negotiations: When the CJEU quashed Privacy Shield\u2019s predecessor, Safe Harbor in its Schrems I decision of 2015, regulatory chaos ensued.SCCs could help in the short term, but they have problems, too. The court found that SCCs are generally sufficient for transferring personal data. However, the court said that E.U. data protection authorities are obliged to stop SCC-based transfers if they have concerns about data protection in the receiving country. The ruling thus creates significant uncertainty for any firm based in Europe that operates in countries such as China or India where governments have broad surveillance powers. Max Schrems\u2019s nonprofit claims the court\u2019s decision means that SCCs cannot be used anymore for data transfers to the United States, and Hamburg\u2019s activist data protection authority seems to agree. Facebook says it will await guidance, putting pressure on the European Union and the United States to find a solution.ADADThe European Court is becoming more activist on fundamental rightsSchrems and other recent decisions suggest the European Court is becoming more sensitive to public opinion and hence emphasizing fundamental rights. In the wake of 9/11, Europeans broadly supported U.S. counterterrorism measures, but over the past decade, Europeans have begun to favor safeguarding fundamental rights over security concerns, and the courts have followed. For example, in the Kadi case, an E.U. court in 2005 first upheld the U.N. Security Council\u2019s ability to freeze assets of alleged terrorism suspects. Yet in 2008, the highest court reversed course, ruling that blacklisted suspects deserve full judicial review and that governments must explain their reasons for imposing sanctions. The court ultimately upheld this decision in 2013, when only 1 in 50 Europeans still considered terrorism an important issue. That same year, Edward Snowden revealed that Facebook was affected by the National Security Agency\u2019s mass surveillance programs, which led to the original Schrems case.Public concerns in Europe about data protection remain high. In a 2019 E.U.-wide survey, over 80 percent of respondents said they had only \u201cpartial\u201d or \u201cno control at all\u201d over the information they provide online \u2014 despite the introduction of the E.U.\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation in 2018. The Kadi and Schrems cases both suggest that Europe\u2019s highest court has become more similar to the U.S. Supreme Court, whose responsiveness to public opinion is well documented. As long as the CJEU does not face a public backlash, expect more bold rulings from the court defending fundamental rights.ADADEurope and California are replacing Washington as standard-settersWith Schrems II, the CJEU has asserted its role as international standard-setter in data protection and privacy law. While Congress remains divided over establishing national standards, California\u2019s Consumer Privacy Act came into effect in 2020. The regulations under that law are poised to lead to more stringent standards nationwide.To advance privacy protection, both the European Union and California are using a powerful legal principle also used by the federal government, \u201cextraterritoriality,\u201d or the application of one jurisdiction\u2019s laws in other jurisdictions. The United States has long sought to enforce certain domestic legal standards abroad. A key example is the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, which resulted in U.S. sanctions against several European companies and led to the adoption of the 1997 OECD Anti-Bribery Convention. In the Schrems II case, the CJEU effectively asserts the extraterritoriality of E.U. data protection regulations. Some now raise concerns about a \u201cbalkanization of the Internet.\u201d But when faced with the choice of either complying with E.U. law or separating their European operations, U.S. tech giants previously stated they will comply. If the field of anti-corruption is any guidance, extraterritorial application of E.U. privacy rules could lead to stronger international standards and support the push for privacy rights in the United States.ADADMichael F.

Bannon, could endanger activists under repressive governments who rely on the Open Technology Fund to combat Internet censorship and surveillance.Pack had fired the technology group\u2019s top officials and bipartisan board since being confirmed June\u20094 as chief executive of the U.S. Agency for Global Media, which oversees Voice of America and four U.S. government-funded news outlets: the Open Technology Fund, Radio Free Europe, Radio Free Asia and Middle East Broadcasting Networks.ADADSeven U.S. senators, including Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), wrote Pack expressing \u201cdeep concern\u201d about the staff cuts he has ordered. Republican House members have also aired misgivings, and four existing board members, including two former U.S. ambassadors, filed suit to halt the changes.A lower court said earlier in the case that international broadcasting sponsored by the United States for nearly 80 years has served as a \u201ctrusted and authoritative global news source\u201d and model of journalistic excellence that has helped to undermine and topple some of history\u2019s most oppressive regimes.\u201cThe defendant, Michael Pack \u2014 is accused of putting this legacy at serious risk,\u201d the lower court said.ADIn Tuesday\u2019s order, U.S. Appeals Court judges David S. Tatel, Thomas B. Griffith and Patricia A. Millett ruled that it appeared Pack did not have statutory authority to appoint or control the fund\u2019s board members or operations.ADIn staying Pack\u2019s changes pending a \u201chighly expedited\u201d appeal, the judges said existing board members who filed suit showed that \u201cthe government\u2019s actions have jeopardized OTF\u2019s relationships with its partner organizations, leading its partner organizations to fear for their safety.\u201dThe court said the fund also would face \u201can increasing risk that its decision-making will be taken over by the government,\u201d undermining its reputation and effectiveness.Read the court\u2019s order hereThe Justice Department declined to comment. Spokesmen for the U.S. Agency for Global Media did not immediately respond to a request for comment.ADIn lobbying for Pack\u2019s confirmation, Trump and the White House portrayed Voice of America as an out-of-control news organization that has distributed \u201cpropaganda\u201d favorable to regimes in China and Iran \u2014 a claim vigorously disputed by VOA. Pack\u2019s team in news statements has defended some changes, citing \u201cobstructionism\u201d that held up his nomination, \u201cbias and partisanship\u201d and unspecified but \u201cknown mismanagement and scandals that have plagued the agency for decades.\u201dADBegun as a Radio Free Asia pilot project in 2012, the Open Technology Fund has grown into an independent nonprofit grantee of the Agency for Global Media, incorporated last year and appropriated $20\u2009million by Congress.The group has funded programs in 60 countries with more than 2\u2009billion people to allow secure and uncensored access to U.S. information sources and the broader Internet \u2014 through tools such as the encrypted communications app Signal and the anonymous Web-accessing network Tor \u2014 despite authoritarian government controls. It has also worked to protect journalists, sources and consumers from digital attack and aided researchers and technology developers.ADIn an interview, plaintiffs\u2019 attorney Deepak Gupta said: \u201cWe\u2019re thrilled that the court recognized today that the federal government does not have the power to take over this independent, nonprofit organization. This is critically important because many of the people who rely on Open Technology Fund\u2019s work are activists and journalists in repressive regimes \u2014 in places like Tehran and Hong Kong \u2014 and they can\u2019t afford to lose that support while this case proceeds.\u201dADPack\u2019s critics warned that activists and technology developers who work with the fund take great risks by revealing their identities to it, making it essential that the group remain independent of the U.S. government in perception and reality. The suit alleged that Pack\u2019s aggressive moves to obtain physical access to and control of the fund\u2019s office has caused some to question their security and \u201cthe potential for [their] data to be obtained by a hostile actor.\u201dThe appeals panel ruling partially overturned a July\u20092 denial by Chief U.S. District Judge Beryl A. Howell of Washington of a temporary restraining order sought by plaintiffs, in which Howell declined to block changes to the other broadcasting agencies.ADHowell found that if Pack\u2019s actions turn out to be misguided, diminishing the U.S. global presence and strengthening totalitarian governments, accountability for the changes at the media agencies rests \u201cat the ballot box.\u201dADThe appeals court\u2019s decision came one day after D.C.

What\u2019s in the bill?The U.S. Congress passed a bill that would require the State Department, in consultation with the Treasury, to report on and establish penalties for foreign persons and entities who have \u201cmaterially\u201d contributed to undermining Hong Kong\u2019s \u201cone country, two systems\u201d framework. It gives the president the power to block assets and deny U.S. entry to those involved.AD2. How are banks drawn in?The legislation would also penalize foreign financial institutions that knowingly do business with sanctioned individuals. Big U.S. banks are at risk since their foreign subsidiaries may have Chinese officials, their relatives and associates as customers. Investment banks get a big chunk of their Chinese revenue from stock sales, financing for companies and big shareholders. Commercial and retail banks in the U.S. could be even more exposed because most global transactions are done in U.S. dollars and flow through the U.S. banking system. The report on banks will be submitted after individuals are disclosed, giving lenders time to adjust.AD3. What are the penalties?ADBanks singled out could face a cascade of sanctions, including a block on assets, restrictions on access to loans from U.S. institutions, bans on being a primary dealer in U.S. debt, conducting foreign exchange and banking transactions as well penalties on executives among others, according to the bill.4. What\u2019s at stake?The five big U.S. banks had a combined $701 billion of exposure to China in 2019, with JPMorgan clocking the biggest investment at $19 billion. They now could also face the risk of a tit-for-tat if China chooses to retaliate over the U.S. sanctions, clouding their growth plans and threatening income they have generated over the years from advising giants such as Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. Profits in China\u2019s brokerage industry could hit $47 billion by 2026, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. estimates, with foreign firms gunning for a considerable share. Insurers, asset managers and commercial banks are also pushing into China.ADADSpokespeople at Citigroup, JPMorgan and HSBC declined to comment.5. How worried are they?While the U.S. has broad authority to impose penalties under the act, the initial fallout may be limited to the most senior Chinese officials since the U.S. is unlikely to take action that will significantly disrupt trade or hurt the global economy, according to estimates from bank executives who asked not to be identified discussing an internal analysis.6. What are banks doing now?Global banks are reviewing their client base to identify people who may be exposed to sanctions and looking over agreements to make sure that they have clauses that allow them to ditch customers without penalty. Once the sanction list is released, banks will need to ensure they have effective procedures to cut ties with those individuals.ADAD7. What about Chinese banks?China\u2019s biggest state-owned lenders, led by Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd., are the most exposed given their close ties to the country\u2019s government officials. Severing those links would be difficult, if not impossible. Chinese lenders have $1.1 trillion in dollar funding at stake, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. If they are sanctioned, the president can also ban U.S. investors from holding equity or debt in the lenders.8. Can companies be sanctioned?Yes. Sanctions would also apply to entities. A broad application to companies, especially ones that have a significant footprint in China or Hong Kong, would pose a greater risk to global banks because it can be harder to untangle those relationships. Banks will likely be prohibited from doing business with a company that\u2019s 50% or more controlled by a sanctioned individual, according to Office of Foreign Assets Control guidance.ADAD9. What\u2019s the timing?President Donald Trump hasn\u2019t indicated yet whether he will sign the bill, but it has veto-proof support in Congress. If enacted, the State Department has 90 days to submit a report on whether any individuals or companies merit sanctions. Reports on financial institutions must be submitted within 60 days after that. The president has the leeway to wait one year before imposing sanctions.10. Has this happened before?Similar. Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control included the Venezuelan central bank in its list of sanctioned entities in April last year. In 2018, the Trump administration sanctioned seven Russian tycoons, 12 companies and 17 senior government officials including key allies of President Vladimir Putin. BNP Paribas SA was fined $8.9 billion by the U.S. in 2014, the largest ever for an individual bank, for transactions with Sudan and other blacklisted nations.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P.", "comment": "2 Comments", "topic": "Business"}, {"cover": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ZMKKHKV364I6VF6BNTYRN77CNQ.jpghttps://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ZMKKHKV364I6VF6BNTYRN77CNQ.jpg", "title": "U.S. New Cases Top 50,000; France Corrals Outbreak: Virus Update", "date": "Jul 2, 2020", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/on-small-business/us-new-cases-top-50000-france-corrals-outbreak-virus-update/2020/07/01/abfe9b28-bc11-11ea-97c1-6cf116ffe26c_story.html", "keyword": "China and Security", "website": "the Washington Post", "author": "", "content": "U.S. cases jumped the most since May 9 and Florida\u2019s new coronavirus infections rose by a record.

NY)The novel coronavirus is showing some signs of mutating in a way that may make it easier to spread, according to Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases.ADResearch currently underway suggests a single mutation is emerging that lets the virus replicate better and create a higher viral load, measures that could make it easier to transmit, Fauci said at an online event Thursday hosted by the Journal of the American Medical Association.There is some dispute about the findings and it\u2019s not clear whether people who become infected with a newer variation of the pathogen fare worse than those with the original strain, he said. \u201cIt just seems that the virus replicates better and may be more transmissible,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is still at the stage of trying to confirm that.\u201dADModerna Sets Human Trial for Vaccine (1:40 p.m. NY)ADDrug-maker Moderna Inc. said a 30,000-patient trial of its Covid-19 vaccine candidate will start late this month, although a Stats News article earlier Thursday said the work had been expected to begin next week.

But Brazilian Director-General Roberto Azevedo\u2019s decision to step down at the end of August, a year before his term ends, also offers an opportunity for the U.S., the European Union and other nations to reshape the organization.Support our journalism. Subscribe today.arrow-right1. What\u2019s at stake?The Geneva-based WTO\u2019s mission of economic integration is under threat from protectionist policies around the globe, and without reform it risks being sidelined during the biggest economic crisis in a century. The world\u2019s largest economies agree that the organization must evolve to address the shifts in technology and the global trading system that have occurred since 1995. If members can align behind a candidate committed to modernization, it could break bureaucratic logjams and help unleash a wave of global growth at a time when it is needed most. If no such candidate can be found, the WTO risks further receding into irrelevance.ADAD2. What\u2019s precipitated the crisis?The WTO\u2019s appellate body, the main forum for settling worldwide trade disagreements, lost its ability in December 2019 to rule on new dispute cases. That resulted from a U.S. refusal over the previous two years to consider any nominees to fill vacancies on the panel. WTO members can still bring disputes to the trade body and receive an initial ruling, but that can be appealed into legal limbo. The U.S. imposition of hundreds of billions of dollars worth of tariffs against China, and use of the WTO\u2019s national security loophole to levy duties on steel and aluminum, have also weakened the organization.3. What is the WTO\u2019s selection process?ADThe chairman of the WTO General Council launched a selection procedure in June to confirm the trade body\u2019s next director-general. WTO members had sought to truncate the six-month process into just three in order to avoid a leadership vacuum in September, but it\u2019s likely a new candidate won\u2019t be selected until after the U.S. presidential election in November. During this time, the candidates will present themselves to the WTO\u2019s membership, campaign for support and sit for a question-and-answer session with the WTO General Council. Then the WTO\u2019s three highest-ranking delegates, known as \u201cthe troika,\u201d will consult with the membership and try to build a consensus around a final candidate.AD4. Who is running?\u2022 Mohammad Maziad Al-Tuwaijri, Saudi Arabia\u2019s former minister of economy and planning.AD\u2022 Liam Fox, the United Kingdom\u2019s former secretary of state for international trade.\u2022 Jesus Seade Kuri, Mexico\u2019s chief negotiator of USMCA and a former WTO deputy director-general.\u2022 Abdel-Hamid Mamdouh, an Egyptian attorney at King & Spalding LLP and former services division director at the WTO.\u2022 Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, Nigeria\u2019s former finance minister and former managing director of the World Bank.\u2022 Amina Chawahir Mohamed Jibril, Kenya\u2019s former international trade minister.\u2022 Tudor Ulianovschi, Moldova\u2019s former minister of foreign affairs.\u2022 Yoo Myung-hee, South Korea\u2019s trade minister.5. What credentials are required?WTO rules require candidates to have \u201cextensive experience in international relations, encompassing economic, trade and/or political experience; a firm commitment to the work and objectives of the WTO; proven leadership and managerial ability; and demonstrated communications skills.\u201dADAD6. What kind of leader are nations looking for?Governments hope the next WTO director-general can persuade members to complete the much-needed reform of the organization. Trade officials in Geneva broadly argue that Azevedo\u2019s successor should have sufficient leadership authority and capability to marshal broad support around the WTO\u2019s reform agenda. That means strong consideration should be given to candidates who have, at the very least, some experience as a minister.7. Is there a nationality requirement?No. However, trade officials from the U.S., EU and Canada say the next WTO director-general should come from a developed country due to their belief that the organization\u2019s leadership should rotate between developed and developing countries. Not all delegates agree on this, however, and representatives from African nations argue that it\u2019s their continent\u2019s turn to take on the top mantle of the WTO.ADAD8. Should a woman lead the WTO?There is a strong push among Geneva trade delegates to select a woman to lead the WTO for the first time. However, free-trade advocates like Wendy Cutler, vice president of the Washington-based Asia Society Policy Institute, argue that WTO members should try to avoid placing gender constraints on the selection process.9. Are there any other considerations?The candidate must also thread a narrow diplomatic needle that displeases neither the U.S. nor China, whose bitter conflict over the pandemic is testing their fragile economic truce. The Trump administration has actively sought to undermine the WTO\u2019s ability to function, saying it has infringed on American sovereignty and enabled China to become a big economic player globally at the expense of U.S. jobs and manufacturing. Adding to the unpredictability factor, President Donald Trump -- who has called the WTO the worst trade deal the U.S. has ever signed -- is up for re-election in November, so America\u2019s tolerance for a candidate who looks too favorably on China might be tested. Meanwhile, China has engaged in a multi-year campaign to expand its diplomatic influence by installing key personnel at the top levels of international decision making bodies.10. What happens if no candidate is selected?One of the WTO\u2019s four deputy directors-general may serve as an interim caretaker if the WTO\u2019s members cannot agree on a consensus nominee by Sept. 1. They are Yonov Frederick Agah of Nigeria, Karl Brauner of Germany, Alan Wolff of the U.S. and Yi Xiaozhun of China.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P.", "comment": "0 Comments", "topic": "Business"}, {"cover": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/XGGTBNGDAEI6VNHWZM443CKA7M.jpghttps://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/XGGTBNGDAEI6VNHWZM443CKA7M.jpg", "title": "Uighurs reflect on 2009 violence that set off Chinese crackdown", "date": "Jul 10, 2020", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/religion/uighurs-reflect-on-2009-violence-that-set-off-chinese-crackdown/2020/07/10/03ce53ae-c246-11ea-9fdd-b7ac6b051dc8_story.html", "keyword": "China and Security", "website": "the Washington Post", "author": "", "content": "It was 11 years ago that Gulruy Asqer began praying for a chance to escape China.Asqer, a Uighur poet now living in Memphis, was back then living in Urumqi, the capital city of the Xinjiang region of China that is home to the mostly Muslim Uighur minority.Support our journalism.

I was so helpless.\u201dADExperts say that month\u2019s unrest and the state\u2019s aggressive response marked a major turning point in China\u2019s brutal crackdown against the Uighur minority.ADThe unrest began with a student-led Uighur uprising on July 5, 2009. Human rights activists and Uighur eyewitnesses say the initial protests were peaceful. Violence only broke out, they say, when Chinese paramilitary \u2014 called in to quell the riots \u2014 fired live ammunition into protesters.Ads around the city were replaced by posters from law enforcement seeking information about and the capture of young Uighur men suspected of involvement in the protests. Asqer\u2019s neighbor\u2019s sons, high school students at the time, were taken and sentenced to 15 years in prison.AD\u201cI could tell what would happen in the future,\u201d Asqer said. \u201cI was so aware that if I just made it to the U.S., I would never return to this bloody land.\u201dDiscord between the Hans and the Uighurs, indigenous to the Xinjiang region, had been common since the Han-majority government took control of the region after the Communist revolution in 1949.ADThe impetus for the 2009 protests came that June, at a toy factory in the city of Shaoguan, about 2,500 miles from Urumqi.A factory worker posted an unsubstantiated rumor online that Uighur migrant workers had raped Han Chinese women there. Some Han Chinese workers responded by beating Uighur workers in a brutal attack captured on camera. At least two died in the attacks.ADWhen the gory video footage spread online, long-simmering ethnic tensions in Xinjiang rose to a boiling point.\u201cIt is a very clear depiction of men being hunted down and beaten to death,\u201d said University of Nottingham historian Rian Thum, who researches Islam in China. \u201cThe clarity of that video is what made it so powerful in mobilizing people.\u201dPeaceful student-led protests for justice soon turned deadly. Young Uighur men rampaged through the streets on July 5, beating and stabbing Hans and attacking Han businesses. For days afterward, Han mobs armed with sticks and metal bars carried out violent reprisals.ADAnd in the weeks and months following, thousands of Uighurs, mostly young men in their 20s, disappeared from the region.AD\u201cI now think of it as the beginning of the era of disappearances,\u201d said Sophie Richardson, China director at Human Rights Watch, which published a report documenting the \u201cenforced disappearances\u201d of 43 Uighur men and teenage boys detained by Chinese security forces as part of what researchers described as a \u201cmassive campaign of unlawful arrests.\u201dRichardson and other experts on the Uighur crisis spoke during a July 2 webinar organized by the Uyghur Human Rights Project and World Uyghur Congress to explore how the 2009 events \u201cpaved the way from systematic assimilation to today\u2019s cultural genocide.\u201d\u201cIn many ways, that was a pivotal day in terms of ethnic tensions erupting in Xinjiang itself,\u201d said Adrian Zenz, a Washington-based anthropologist whose research helped uncover the vast scale of China\u2019s \u201creeducation camps\u201d for Uighurs. \u201cNo matter who died or who started what .\u2009.\u2009. that is when the underlying rupture became visible and ethnic relations were changed forever.\u201dADADZenz described a \u201cgreat deal of consistency\u201d between the state\u2019s aggressive response to the Uighur uprising and today\u2019s repression of Uighurs. But what\u2019s surprising, he said, is the \u201cspeed and intensity\u201d with which this repression multiplied in scale.In the years since 2009, Asqer\u2019s brother, brother-in-law and two nephews \u2014 one of whom participated in the protests \u2014 have joined more than a million Uighurs and other Turkic minorities who have disappeared into China\u2019s shadowy network of mass detention camps.Reports suggest that constant surveillance, brainwashing, forced labor, forced sterilizations and abortions, and even organ harvesting are likely taking place at a systemic level within those camps.ADProminent exiled Uighur activist Rebiya Kadeer, the World Uyghur Congress leader whom Chinese officials later blamed for instigating the violence, claimed that month that nearly 10,000 Uighurs went missing overnight after the protests.ADIt was the Chinese government\u2019s silence when Han Chinese people \u2014 not just the state, but fellow civilians \u2014 killed Uighurs in Shaoguan that finally forced Uighurs to the breaking point, said Jevlan Shirmehmet, a Uighur who has lived in Turkey since 2011.Chinese officials say that nearly 200 people, most of them Han Chinese, died in what they described as riots \u201cinstigated and directed from abroad, and carried out by outlaws in the country in the region.\u201d Another 1,700 people were injured and 1,000 arrested, according to government records.ADHuman rights advocates say those numbers, which cannot be independently verified, obscure the violence and abuses perpetrated by police and Han civilians against Uighurs.Shirmehmet compared the events to the Tiananmen Square massacre of 1989. But while the student-led Tiananmen pro-democracy demonstrations are known globally, grabbing major media attention because they took place in Beijing and because they lasted two months before the government successfully suppressed them, the conflict in Urumqi is not so widely known.ADThe Urumqi protests were crushed within hours, Shirmehmet said. On top of that, he said, many witnesses of the Tiananmen crackdown are now overseas telling their tale. Those who saw the Urumqi massacre \u201ccan\u2019t even move from one city to another,\u201d he said.ADThe Chinese government cut off Internet access in Xinjiang until April 2010. When access returned, residents could no longer use global social media such as Facebook, YouTube and Twitter. CCTV and other forms of surveillance became ubiquitous.Daily life has been transformed. \u201cFor Uighur teenagers, finding jobs became difficult,\u201d Shirmehmet told Religion News Service, the Islamic call to prayer echoing behind him. \u201cEven [a] driver\u2019s license is very difficult to get for Uighur people.

Subscribe today.arrow-rightThat could be an electoral disaster for the president, who\u2019s locked in a difficult reelection race \u2014 especially if the coronavirus pandemic makes it difficult or risky for many of his supporters to vote in person.\u00a0The issue was already dividing Trump from Republican election officials who have generally joined Democrats in trying to vastly expand mail voting during the pandemic so people don't have to risk their health to cast ballots. Now it\u2019s splitting him from his own party\u2019s strategists.\u00a0ADADThe president\u2019s criticism of mail voting \u201cdoes reduce the likelihood of Republicans embracing this process,\u201d a senior GOP strategist told my colleagues. \u201cEspecially for older, more rural voters, that could be important for Republicans getting out the vote in 2020. I don\u2019t want \u2018I will not vote by mail\u2019 to become a political statement. But it may be too late.\u201d\u00a0The rift is especially noteworthy because voting by mail has not historically been a partisan issue. Many right-leaning states, such as Utah and Arizona, have embraced the process with large percentages of their populations casting mail ballots. Many left-leaning states, including Massachusetts and New York, have shied away from it.\u00a0The disparities between Republicans and Democrats are unmistakable.\u00a0About twice as many Virginia Democrats applied for absentee ballots compared to Republicans in the state\u2019s June 23 primaries. That\u2019s despite the fact Republicans had a competitive Senate primary to vote in while Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.) was running unopposed for his party\u2019s nomination.\u00a0ADADIn Kentucky\u2019s June 23 primary, about 90 percent of Democrats cast their ballots before Election Day, either by mail voting or early voting. Just 80 percent of Republicans did so.\u00a0In Georgia\u2019s June 9 primaries, about 60,000 fewer Republicans cast ballots by mail compared to Democrats despite a majority of Georgia voters traditionally voting Republican.\u00a0Republicans are also expressing widespread distrust of mail voting.\u00a0A Washington Post-ABC News poll\u00a0in late May found 87 percent of Democrats think it should be easier to vote by mail compared to just 33 percent of Republicans.\u00a0That\u2019s despite the fact that fraud risks from voting by mail are, in fact, exceptionally low.\u00a0ADThe few prominent cases have been easily discovered. That includes an effort launched by GOP operatives in North Carolina in 2018 and a recent case that led to criminal charges against members of the Paterson, N.J., city council. Council members there are elected on a nonpartisan basis.\u00a0A\u00a0Washington Post analysis\u00a0recently found possible voter fraud cases in states that vote primarily by mail accounted for just 0.0025 percent of ballots in 2016 and 2018 \u00a0\u2014 or about one out of every 39,000.\u00a0Republicans have also lashed out at their own representatives when they embraced voting by mail or urged them to cast ballots that way.\u00a0In one dramatic example, a Republican senator seeking reelection sent a mass text urging constituents to apply for absentee ballots. The senator got a reply saying, \u201cNo one should legitimize this mail-in voting hogwash,\u201d my colleagues report.\u00a0ADADSkepticism about mail voting was also on display in primaries yesterday in New Jersey.P. Kenneth Burns with Philadelphia\u2019s WHYY public radio station:\u00a0The New Jersey primary was held almost entirely by mail without any major problems. Results in some races could take a week or longer because of the high volume of absentee votes, but winners have already been declared in some high profile races. That includes former Vice President Joe Biden, who's already the party's presumptive nominee, winning the state's Democratic presidential primary.\u00a0Trump hasn\u2019t slowed his assaults \u2013 despite voting by mail himself in Florida this year.\u00a0In a June 2 tweet the president pointed to the Paterson case and claimed that \u201cMail-In Ballots will lead to massive electoral fraud and a rigged 2020 Election.\u201dThe president also regularly rants about mail ballots and voter fraud in the Oval Office, one former senior administration official told my colleagues, because \u201cone, he truly believes it, and two, it gives him an out if he loses.\u201dADADBiden, meanwhile, has urged states to expand mail voting and early voting during the pandemic. He voted by mail in Delaware\u2019s primary, which was also held yesterday and where he was also declared the winner.\u00a0NBC News\u2019s Mike Memoli:Even government health officials are carefully disputing the president\u2019s claims.\u00a0The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention quietly issued updated guidance June 22 urging voters to consider alternatives to in-person voting on Election Day including voting by mail, Michelle Ye Hee Lee reports.\u00a0The CDC circulated the updated guidance to election officials in June but didn\u2019t promote it publicly. It was shared more widely yesterday by Sens. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and Patty Murray (D-Wash.), who had urged the CDC to update its guidance.ADKlobuchar led a push by Senate Democrats to invest $3.6 billion in expanding mail voting and other reforms to ensure the November election is safe and secure. Those efforts have been blocked by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) who opposes federal mandates on elections.\u00a0AD\u201cIn the midst of this pandemic, voters should not need to choose between their health and casting their ballots,\u201d Klobuchar said. \u201cThis guidance from the CDC makes it clear that the government must take steps to protect voters.\u201dThe keysFBI Director Christopher A. Wray launched a broadside against China for hacking U.S. companies and coronavirus researchers.\u00a0\u201cAt this very moment, China is working to compromise American health-care organizations, pharmaceutical companies and academic institutions conducting essential covid research,\u201d Wray said during an address at the conservative Hudson Institute think tank.ADFBI agents open up a new counterintelligence investigation against China \u201cabout every 10 hours,\u201d Wray said. Such investigations have also increased 1,300 percent in the past decade, he said, as Devlin Barrett reports.ADThe speech comes as Trump and officials throughout his administration have sharpened their criticism of China during the pandemic.\u201cChina is engaged in a whole-of-state effort to become the world\u2019s only superpower, by any means necessary,\u201d the FBI director said. \u201cThe sad fact is that instead of engaging in the hard slog of innovation, China often steals American intellectual property and then uses it to compete against the very American companies it victimized.\u201dMicrosoft disrupted a massive hacking campaign that took advantage of the pandemic.The fraud campaign targeted millions of Microsoft users across 62 countries, the company said in a blog post. Many of the attacks were aimed at conning people who were working from home into wiring money to accounts they thought belonged to company executives but were actually controlled by the criminal hacking ring, Alyza Sebenius at Bloomberg News reports.\u00a0ADADMicrosoft won a judicial order that allowed it to seize misleading Web domains the hackers were using\u00a0to steal people\u2019s usernames, passwords and other information.\u00a0\u201cIn cases where criminals suddenly and massively scale their activity and move quickly to adapt their techniques to evade Microsoft\u2019s built-in defensive mechanisms, additional measures such as the legal action filed in this case are necessary,\u201d the company said.It\u2019s rare for a company to take that legal route.

Boeing is an American company, and Iranian experts needed a converter to recover data from the black box, but the United States opposed providing it to Iran.Iran accidentally shot down the Boeing 737-800, killing all 176 people aboard, after mistaking it for an incoming missile.

Beijing\u00a0should instead \u00a0ramp up secure\u00a0options for investors, such as accelerating the offering of real estate investment trusts.\u00a0Recent gains in mainland real estate prices have all the hallmarks of\u00a0so-called\u00a0revenge spending\u00a0for big purchases after lockdowns eased. Prices rose in May\u00a0at the fastest pace in seven months, and analysts think June will be even better.\u00a0Sales by the 16 developers Bloomberg Intelligence tracks rose an average 13% in June versus\u00a0a year earlier.\u00a0It might look like a splurge, yet there are signs that these gains will be sustainable, even if capped by government policy that discourages speculation in favor of\u00a0habitation.\u00a0Expect selective rises where people feel their money is safe, like big\u00a0tier-one cities such as\u00a0Shanghai and\u00a0Beijing, as well as Guangzhou and Shenzhen, part of\u00a0the government-promoted Greater Bay Area\u00a0that encompasses\u00a0Hong Kong and Macau.\u00a0There\u2019s certainly a desire to scratch the spending itch. Much of China\u2019s economy was shut in the spring as the government, keen to stop Covid-19 from spreading, halted land sales to developers and purchases of homes. Now developers have come back in with huge discounts. But there are deeper factors at play that should keep lifting prices.First, since the coronavirus hit, the government has been easing credit.\u00a0Mortgage rates are at 33-month lows, with the average for a first-time home buyer at 5.28%. Many\u00a0shut out from an increasingly unaffordable housing market are taking advantage, as are investors keen for something safer than volatile stocks.Second,\u00a0the government is creating demand in some cities, loosening residency rules to encourage people to move in\u00a0from rural areas. The theory is that a larger urban class boosts consumption \u2014\u00a0though what it has really lifted is buying homes. The reform of local residency permits includes easing access to these \u201chukou\u201d for anyone with tertiary education in cities like Hangzhou, where\u00a0Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.\u00a0is based.\u00a0 The city of 10 million people added 554,000 residents last year, the biggest increase in permanent population of any city in China.Support our journalism.

In contrast, urban areas\u00a0not benefiting from hukou relaxation or lacking the kind of government-infrastructure spending drive\u00a0to offset the pandemic\u2019s economic impact\u00a0should see prices stay flat or rise just around 2%, he says.\u00a0ADADIn May,\u00a0Shanghai, Beijing, Guangzhou\u00a0and Shenzhen\u00a0saw new home prices increase\u00a0more than 1% for the second month in a row. The\u00a0last time the tier-one cities experienced gains of this magnitude was in late 2016; since then, much of the climb\u00a0in property prices\u00a0has been in\u00a0smaller cities that have fewer\u00a0restrictions on buying for investment.\u00a0Older homes rose around 0.6%, beating gains elsewhere. In China,\u00a0unlike most countries, local authorities cap prices\u00a0on the sale of new homes, so they can actually be cheaper than older ones.Still, these small percentages show that China is in no mood to allow a big housing boom, even though real estate spending and all its attendant construction and furnishings account for a quarter of the economy. Funding remains\u00a0tight for\u00a0developers.\u00a0As an example, the\u00a0one-year-loan prime\u00a0rate is down 40 basis points to 3.85% since last August,\u00a0but the five-year-loan prime rate on which mortgages are based has fallen just\u00a020 basis points to 4.65%.\u00a0Developers who\u00a0want to build housing can only issue new onshore or offshore bonds to finance repaying existing bonds expiring in 12 months, according to Nomura Holdings Inc. analysts, and need approval for offshore loans. No wonder there\u2019s a  long queue spinning off their real-estate management arms \u2014\u00a0which tend to have better steady cash flow \u2014\u00a0for Hong Kong listings.\u00a0One solution that would ease the debt burden on developers while giving investors safer diversification is to expand a  real estate investment trust trial that China kicked off in\u00a0April. It\u00a0has been focused on pooling capital to fund infrastructure such as\u00a0highways and airports \u2014\u00a0perhaps no surprise, as this could give the economy a faster boost. But at some point, why not include real estate, both commercial and residential?\u00a0That would let\u00a0Chinese families, who have around 70% of their wealth tied up in property \u2014 more than double the U.S. \u2014 invest\u00a0in their favorite asset\u00a0and still diversify into stocks.\u00a0This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Nisha Gopalan is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering deals and banking.

It's sure to have wide-ranging implications for the service that has become a core communication channel in American society, disseminating everything from President Trump's rockets to corporate news.\u00a0\u201cThe problem is that we all rely on Twitter as this public space that is safe and secure, and we know that the tweets that someone like a Joe Biden is sending out are authentic,\u201d Harper Reed, an entrepreneur who served as the 2012 Obama campaign\u2019s chief technology officer, told me. \u201cTwitter has proven to us that may not be true.\u201dAccounts belonging to prominent billionaires and politicians began posting similar messages yesterday afternoon asking for money to be sent to cryptocurrency accounts, Rachel Lerman, Joseph Marks and I reported. The messages received thousands of likes before they were taken off Twitter, and in some instances, they were posted again from the same account.Twitter is still investigating the situation, but it appears to have originated from a social engineering attack targeting Twitter employees. From the company:The hackers could have sown mass chaos with the privileged access they scored.\u00a0It appears the accounts were seeking financial gain based on what is known so far. But technologists warn they could have done far more damage after infiltrating the accounts of some of the world's most prominent figures. The incident demonstrates how the tools technology companies build can be misused, Reed said.ADAD\u201cWe\u2019re lucky this was a bitcoin scam and not something that was greater or more nefarious,\u201d he said.The incident is certain to reverberate through Washington, where Twitter is increasingly used by government officials.\u00a0Security experts have long fretted about bad actors infiltrating President Trump\u2019s account, which has become his favorite bully pulpit at all hours of the day and night. Now that the accounts of Biden and Barack Obama were hit, those concerns are no longer theoretical. \u00a0Trump\u2019s account did not post a bitcoin message and did not appear to be affected by the incident. But critics swiftly warned that the incident highlighted the risk of his social-media-first style of governance.\u00a0AD\u201cThis data breach in particular underscores just how troubling it is to have a president who dictates policy ad hoc over Twitter and practices the opposite of responsible digital citizenship,\u201d Rep. Jennifer Wexton (D-Va.), founder of the Congressional Task Force on Digital Citizenship, told me.ADIt's also certain to increase concerns Twitter could be compromised closer to Election Day.

That worries company leaders who say the bad actors could have wreaked havoc on the stock market, as tweets from world leaders have been known to move markets.\u00a0AD\u201cIt will become real to people what influence and power these channels have,\u201d Ashkan Soltani, a former Federal Trade Commission chief technologist, told me in an interview.\u00a0Twitter will inevitably face greater political scrutiny.\u00a0Social media companies are already under a microscope in this election year. And with each breached account yesterday, Twitter's political problems multiplied.\u00a0ADThis isn\u2019t Twitter\u2019s first brush with cybersecurity issues, and the company is currently under an order with the FTC related to privacy settlement. Depending on the circumstances that caused this breach, the agency may move to open an investigation into whether the company violated the terms of that agreement, Soltani told me. The FTC declined to comment.\u00a0ADAlready the incident is sparking scrutiny on Capitol Hill. Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) wrote a letter to Twitter chief executive Jack Dorsey on Wednesday evening, calling on the company to take immediate steps to secure the service and contact the FBI and Justice Department.\u201cAs you know, millions of your users rely on your service not just to tweet publicly but also to communicate privately through your direct message service,\u201d Hawley wrote. \u201cA successful attack on your system\u2019s servers represents a threat to all of your users\u2019 privacy and data security.\u201dADTwitter has struck an apologetic tone about the incident.

Almost 3 million people could qualify.Support our journalism. Subscribe today.arrow-right1. What\u2019s the plan?It has to do with giving expanded rights to Hong Kong residents with unique travel documents known as British National (Overseas), or BNO, passports, and to those considered to be eligible for them. The U.K. created the passports before handing Hong Kong back to China in 1997. They allowed holders to visit the U.K. visa-free for up to six months, but didn\u2019t automatically confer the right to live or work there. Holders also weren\u2019t eligible to access public funds.AD2. What\u2019s changing?U.K. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab told the House of Commons on July 1 that a new \u201cbespoke immigration route\u201d will allow holders of BNO status to come to the U.K. without the current six-month limit. They will be allowed to stay and work in the U.K. for five years. After that period, they can apply for settled status and, after a further 12 months with that status, for citizenship. Family dependents will also be allowed into the U.K. and there will be no limit on the numbers allowed to apply.AD3. Who will be eligible?There were about 350,000 holders of BNO passports as of February, according to the U.K. Home Office. Others born before the July 1, 1997 handover were eligible to apply before that date, however, and the U.K. Home Office says it estimates there are \u201caround 2.9 million BNOs currently in Hong Kong.\u201d That\u2019s almost 40% of the population. Those born after the handover are not eligible.AD4. Why is the U.K. doing this?U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said China\u2019s imposition of the national security law was a \u201cclear and serious breach\u201d of the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration that paved the way for Hong Kong\u2019s return to China in 1997. Speaking in the House of Commons on July 1, he said he\u2019d made clear that if China continued down this path, Britain would introduce a new route for those with BNO status to enter the U.K. \u201cThat is precisely what we will do now,\u201d he said. In an interview with Sky News on June 3, Raab said the U.K. was prepared to sacrifice a free trade deal with China to protect Hong Kong citizens.AD5. What has the reaction been from China?ADThe Chinese Embassy in London said on July 1 the U.K. had previously promised \u201cit will not confer the right of abode to Chinese citizens in Hong Kong who hold BNO passports.\u201d All Chinese compatriots living in Hong Kong count as Chinese nationals, the Embassy said. \u201cIf the British side makes unilateral changes to the relevant practice, it will breach its own position and pledges as well as international law and basic norms guiding international relations.\u201d6. Why didn\u2019t Hong Kong people get regular British passports?People born in Hong Kong after the 1997 handover, who were both Chinese citizens and permanent Hong Kong residents, became eligible for the new Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) passports. While then-Conservative Prime Minister John Major cited Britain\u2019s \u201ccontinuing responsibilities to the people of Hong Kong\u201d in a speech in the city in March 1996, at the same time there was concern within his Tory party back home about the potential scale of arrivals from Hong Kong, according to Jonathan Dimbleby in his book \u201cThe Last Governor.\u201dADAD7. How would Britain handle a large influx now?The government doesn\u2019t expect one. Raab told lawmakers in June that he had held talks with the U.K.\u2019s so-called Five Eyes security allies, the U.S., Canada, Australia and New Zealand, on the potential for sharing the burden of migrants. He said in July he expects \u201ca large number\u201d of those who are eligible to remain in Hong Kong or move elsewhere in the region, while also conceding there would be little the British authorities could do if China tried to block people from Hong Kong traveling to the U.K. Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said his cabinet is \u201cvery actively\u201d considering offering Hong Kong citizens safe haven, but didn\u2019t provide details on how that would be arranged.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P.", "comment": "0 Comments", "topic": "Business"}, {"cover": "", "title": "Today in History", "date": "Jul 20, 2020", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/today-in-history/2020/07/20/891879ba-ca9b-11ea-99b0-8426e26d203b_story.html", "keyword": "China and Security", "website": "the Washington Post", "author": "", "content": "Today in HistoryToday is Saturday, Aug. 1, the 214th day of 2020.

President Donald Trump has begun stripping away that \u201cspecial status\u201d to punish China for moves to tighten its grip on the city after a year of pro-democracy street protests. At its most extreme, that could mean the global financial hub being treated the same as any other Chinese city -- a seismic shift that could harm both economies at an already difficult time. China has already begun retaliating.Support our journalism. Subscribe today.arrow-right1. Is the special status gone?It\u2019s going. On May 27, Secretary of State Michael Pompeo notified Congress that the Trump administration no longer regarded Hong Kong as autonomous from mainland China. On June 29, Commerce Secretary William Ross said the special status had therefore been revoked.ADAD2. What\u2019s been the impact?In an opening salvo, Pompeo announced visa restrictions against unspecified Chinese officials; China did the same against Americans. Pompeo said the U.S. would also cease selling defense equipment to Hong Kong, a largely symbolic act that will mostly affect the city\u2019s police and corrections forces. The Commerce Department made it harder to export sensitive American technology to Hong Kong by suspending special treatment in areas including export license exceptions; Hong Kong\u2019s leader said the impact would be \u201cminimal.\u201d More far-reaching measures could follow. The city is still treated differently from the the mainland when it comes to tariffs, for instance.3. Why so slow?ADIt\u2019s up to Trump to decide how quickly he wants to move while he\u2019s also threatening consequences for China over its handling of the coronavirus and its repression of minorities in Xinjiang province. Hurting China also carries additional risks for the U.S. economy, including the U.S.-China trade deal that Trump had considered one of his biggest achievements, which could affect his odds of winning re-election. Trump has made harsh comments but hasn\u2019t threatened specific punishments for the Beijing government.AD4. What\u2019s at stake for Hong Kong and China?While Hong Kong remains a key gateway from China to the rest of the world, it matters far less to the country\u2019s fortunes than it once did. In 2019, 12% of China\u2019s exports went to or through Hong Kong, down from 45% in 1992. China is also far less reliant on inflows of foreign capital and expertise, and has made a much lower priority of making the yuan an international currency. Nonetheless, the city still matters. Hong Kong\u2019s open capital account and adherence to international standards of governance are unmatched by any mainland Chinese city and make it an important base for international banks and trading firms. Revoking the special status would be \u201cthe nuclear option\u201d and \u201cthe beginning of the death of Hong Kong as we know it,\u201d said Steve Tsang, director of the University of London\u2019s SOAS China Institute.AD5. And their financial markets?ADOne worst-case scenario: if the U.S. treats Hong Kong no differently than any other Chinese city, why wouldn\u2019t ratings firms and investors do the same? It\u2019s a question posed by Deutsche Bank, which noted that S&P Global Ratings has Hong Kong three notches above China while Moody\u2019s and Fitch have Hong Kong one notch higher. The risk is that China\u2019s own rating gets lowered in coming years and drags Hong Kong\u2019s with it. At the same time, equity index providers may take a fresh look at Hong Kong, which is currently in the MSCI World Index with other developed markets. China is in the emerging market index, raising the question, should Hong Kong be treated the same as Shanghai and Shenzhen?6. What about for the U.S.?ADIt has its own reasons for not rocking the boat too much. Hong Kong, the only semi-democratic jurisdiction under Chinese rule, offers U.S. companies a relatively safe way to access the Chinese market and employs a U.S. dollar peg, linking it with the American financial system. According to the Congressional Research Service, the largest U.S. trade surplus in 2019 was with Hong Kong \u2014 $36 billion. Hong Kong counted 278 U.S. companies with regional headquarters in the city that year and another 457 with offices. Hong Kong\u2019s first justice minister after the handover to China in 1997, Elsie Leung, told the South China Morning Post in May that any damage would be mutual: \u201cWe are not just getting the benefits \u2013 it\u2019s a free-trade arrangement which is good for both sides.\u201dAD7. How has China responded?Despite the U.S. action, Chinese lawmakers approved new national security legislation for Hong Kong anyway. The Foreign Ministry has promised unspecified retaliation against what it terms foreign interference, insisting Hong Kong is purely an internal affair. China said last year it would sanction some U.S.-based activist groups including the National Endowment for Democracy, Human Rights Watch and Freedom House, and suspend port visits by U.S. Navy ships to Hong Kong. The official Xinhua News Agency has dismissed as \u201cgroundless\u201d accusations about the loss of freedom or human rights issues in Hong Kong. It also noted that the 2018 Human Freedom Index compiled by the Fraser Institute, a Vancouver-based think tank, ranked Hong Kong at No. 3, well ahead of the U.S. at No. 17.AD8. And Hong Kong?ADThe city\u2019s leader, Chief Executive Carrie Lam, has defended the national security law (as has Li Ka-shing, Hong Kong\u2019s richest tycoon). Lam also has said it would be \u201ctotally unacceptable\u201d for foreign legislatures to interfere in Hong Kong\u2019s internal affairs, and that sanctions would only complicate the problems in the city. (Lam was selected in 2017 by a committee of 1,200 political insiders overwhelmingly loyal to the Chinese government.) She has sought to reassure investors that the city still adheres to the rule of law and has an independent judiciary. She also has defended police actions.9. Is this what the protesters have been seeking?ADAs a largely leaderless movement, the Hong Kong protests have made no official request for international assistance. But some prominent activists including Jimmy Lai and Joshua Wong called on Trump to hit China hard with sanctions, even to the point of revoking the city\u2019s special trading status. Wong had testified last year in Washington in favor of the bill, seeking to put pressure on China. On the streets of Hong Kong, some protesters have made clear their interest in U.S. support by waving American flags, singing \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner\u201d and calling on Trump to \u201cliberate\u201d Hong Kong.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P.", "comment": "0 Comments", "topic": "Business"}, {"cover": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/YWXQ2KGNIEI6VPDKNBA3FDMQSM.jpghttps://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/YWXQ2KGNIEI6VPDKNBA3FDMQSM.jpg", "title": "U.S. Internet freedom group alleges harassment by Trump administration continues despite thwarted takeover", "date": "Jul 24, 2020", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/legal-issues/us-internet-freedom-group-alleges-harassment-by-trump-administration-continues-despite-thwarted-takeover/2020/07/23/1c0239d0-cd0f-11ea-bc6a-6841b28d9093_story.html", "keyword": "China and Security", "website": "the Washington Post", "author": "Spencer S.

Subscribe today.arrow-rightIn a court filing Wednesday night and a letter Thursday to the Justice Department, the fund said the top lawyer for a U.S. media agency that provides grants to the group questioned and appeared to record one of its executives during a snap inspection of its offices.On Wednesday, the lawyer \u2014 Mora Namdar, acting vice president for legal matters of the U.S. Agency for Global Media \u2014 also allegedly inquired about the citizenship status of the fund\u2019s workers and contractors, the group said in objecting to the actions. The query came weeks after the agency ousted the board and leadership of Voice of America, a sister agency, and refused to extend the visas of international journalists working for it.ADADThe fund said Namdar sought the visit Tuesday, the day a panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit blocked similar staffing changes sought by the agency over the fund. The court said the Agency for Global Media appeared to have no authority to appoint or control the fund\u2019s board members or operations.\u201cThese latest actions by the USAGM are extremely troubling, particularly coming just one day after the court\u2019s order,\u201d wrote attorney Deepak Gupta, who represents the fund and four board members who filed suit. \u201cWe hope that the government will decide to stop escalating its efforts to take over the OTF while this case is pending.\u201dAppeals court blocks Trump appointee Michael Pack\u2019s takeover of organization fighting digital censorship and surveillanceThe Justice Department declined to comment. A spokesperson for the Agency for Global Media said it and its officials are unable to comment on ongoing litigation.ADADThe dispute marks the latest controversy under Trump\u2019s appointee to head the agency, Michael Pack, a conservative filmmaker and associate of former White House chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon.Since being confirmed June 4, Pack has fired the top officials and bipartisan board of entities overseen by the agency, which include VOA and four U.S. government-funded news outlets: Radio Free Europe, Radio Free Asia, Middle East Broadcasting Networks and the Open Technology Fund. The fund combats Internet censorship and surveillance by developing technology working with foreign activists, journalists and technology developers.Critics, including leading Republican senators, have accused Pack of jeopardizing a model cultural export and globally trusted source of news and information sponsored by the United States that has helped undermine oppressive regimes around the world.ADADTrump and the White House, during Pack\u2019s two-year confirmation battle, portrayed Voice of America as an out-of-control news organization that has distributed \u201cpropaganda\u201d favorable to regimes in China and Iran \u2014 a claim vigorously disputed by VOA. Pack\u2019s aides have complained of \u201cbias and partisanship\u201d and unspecified but \u201cknown mismanagement and scandals.\u201dDeclining to extend visas at VOA is leading dozens of employees to fear for their jobs and make other plans, threatening production of its many non-English language programs and newscasts, current and former employees said.In a declaration filed in court, Nathaniel Kretchun, Open Technology Fund vice president of programs, said he found Namdar\u2019s inquiries Wednesday \u201cparticularly alarming\u201d because some employees and partners work to advance \u201cfree expression of repressive regimes,\u201d and threats to their status could jeopardize their personal safety.ADADKretchun said Namdar asked several questions about the size of the fund\u2019s staff, their employment status and U.S. citizenship. He said at one point Namdar \u201cbegan filming and narrating,\u201d accompanied by USAGM public affairs director Jonathan Bronitsky, who appeared to record the session with his smartphone.Kretchun said he felt \u201cuncomfortable\u201d because several of Namdar\u2019s questions seemed potentially relevant to the pending lawsuit, he is not a lawyer and the fund had no counsel present. But he said he \u201chad no choice\u201d but to try to answer because Namdar\u2019s email the previous day \u201cappeared to threaten OTF\u2019s grant funding if we did not comply with her inspection or her requests to interview personnel.\u201dGupta asked Justice Department civil division appellate attorney H. Thomas Byron in a letter to counsel his agency client to stop taking \u201cinappropriate, escalating actions.\u201dADADGupta asked the government to confirm by Friday that it will preserve any records and evidence of the inspection, channel all litigation-related communication through attorneys handling the case and cease efforts to access the fund\u2019s offices.Begun as a Radio Free Asia pilot project in 2012, the Open Technology Fund has grown into an independent D.C. nonprofit grantee, incorporated last year and appropriated $20\u2009million by Congress.The group has funded programs in 60 countries with more than 2\u2009billion people to allow secure access to the Internet and U.S.-sponsored news and information, including through tools such as Signal and Tor, which permit users to encrypt communications and anonymously access the Internet despite government controls.

That marks a collapse from late March, when the poll found 57 percent of Americans approved and just 38 percent disapproved of his handling of the economy.\u00a0And Joe Biden is also closing the gap on this issue: Trump has the edge on the former vice president when Americans were asked which candidate they trust more to lead on the economy. But it's now effectively a head-to-head match up \u00a0\u2013 47 percent to 45 percent \u2013 versus an eight-point deficit in late March.\u00a0Other recent polls show Trump faring worse on the question.A Quinnipiac University poll last week found he is underwater on his economic leadership, with just 44 percent approving and 53 percent disapproving, an eight-point drop from June and his worst result on the question since August 2017. The RealClearPolitics average shows voters evenly split on the matter. Meanwhile, half of voters in the Quinnipiac poll trust Biden more on the economy, giving him a five-point lead over Trump. And a Fox News poll showed Biden enjoys a one-point lead over the president on the question.ADADPresented with the results of the Fox News poll in an interview with the network\u2019s Chris Wallace, Trump dismissed them as \u201cfake polls. They were fake in 2016 and now they're even more fake.\u201d\u00a0The economic downturn no doubt is weighing on Trump\u2019s numbers. The pandemic itself looms larger.The president \u201ctrails Biden by more than 2 to 1 among those adults who say they approve of Trump\u2019s handling of the economy but disapprove of the way he has dealt with the coronavirus,\u201d Dan Balz and Scott Clement note. They write that Trump\u2019s chances of reelection now turn on his ability to turn out his base while \u201cconvincing a broader swath of a largely skeptical public that he is dealing effectively with the pandemic.\u201dADBefore the coronavirus arrived in the United States, sending a historically lengthy economic expansion into a recession, Trump was planning to run for reelection on his economic record. He boasted to Wallace that he has \u201calways led on the economy by a lot\u2026 I built the greatest economy in history; I'm now doing it again.\u201d\u00a0Now he's trying to pitch voters that he can be the one to turn it around. Trump has touted the May and June jobs reports that showed surprising rebounds, though the official unemployment rate stands at 11.1 percent. The Congressional Budget Office, among others, predicts it will remain in double-digits through the end of the year. And in his Fox interview, the president pointed to the stock market, which has rallied strongly from March lows despite the suffering in the broader economy.But the president has mostly abandoned his economic message in favor of one focused on stoking the cultural grievances of his base and promising to restore order in cities he frames as overrun by anarchists and violent lawbreakers.Trump\u2019s economic decision-making arguably has never been more consequential.The battered economy is arriving at a crossroads. Republican congressional leaders are heading to the White House today to start negotiations on a fifth economic relief package.ADADTrump on Fox accused Democratic governors of pushing to extend economic shutdowns \u201cbecause they think that\u2019s good for elections.\u201d But Democrats on Capitol Hill have been pushing for more stimulus to help prop up the economy, passing a roughly $3 trillion package in May that Trump threatened to veto.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), on the other hand, is \u201cexpected to introduce an approximately $1 trillion stimulus bill in coming days that will include a limited extension of the federal unemployment benefits approved by Congress in March,\u201d Erica Werner and Jeff Stein report.

Drezner", "content": "Last week Secretary of State Mike Pompeo gave a big human rights speech. In an odd move for a speech on certain inalienable rights, he had some harsh things to say about the freedom of the press and the right of Americans to peaceably assemble. According to my Post colleague Carol Morello:Support our journalism. Subscribe today.arrow-rightSecretary of State Mike Pompeo said Thursday that the American way of life and its founding principles are \u201cunder attack,\u201d focusing his criticism on voices in the mainstream news media and protesters who have torn down statues of historical figures \u2026\u201cAnd yet today, the very core of what it means to be an American, indeed the American way of life itself, is under attack. Instead of seeking to improve America, leading voices promulgate hatred of our founding principles,\u201d he said in his speech at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia. ... Pompeo had harsh criticism for the New York Times\u2019s 1619 Project, on the history of American slavery, saying its underlying message was that \u201cour country was founded for human bondage.\u201d\u201cThey want you to believe the Marxist ideology that America is only the oppressors and the oppressed,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Chinese Communist Party must be gleeful when they see the New York Times spout their ideology.\u201dMorello was hardly the only reporter to note the peculiar nature of Pompeo\u2019s speech.Perhaps those oddities might be due to the underlying reason for him speaking \u2014 the release of the draft report from the Commission on Unalienable Rights that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo convened last year to some controversy. Over the weekend, the hard-working staff here at Spoiler Alerts read that report, and it\u2019s an odd document.ADThe commission is seeking public comment on the draft report, and so far the reviews have been mixed at best. Let\u2019s avail ourselves of the freedom of the press and make my public comment super-public! I\u2019ve adopted the form \u2014 useful in evaluating this State Department\u2019s output \u2014 of how I would grade this if it was, say, a Fletcher School capstone project.ADDear Esteemed Commissioners,You were given a hard assignment. As your chair, Mary Ann Glendon, said in Philadelphia, Secretary of State Pompeo did not give you much in the way of guidance. First, you were to ground your work \u201cin the principles of the U.S. founding and in the principles of the international human rights project \u2014 specifically the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\u201d Second, you were to keep your work \u201cat the level of [principle] and not to get involved in policy.\u201d ADCredit where it\u2019s due, the draft report fits with these instructions. You do a very solid job in particular of connecting the Universal Declaration of Human Rights to America\u2019s founding documents and the country\u2019s idiosyncratic traditions of human rights promotion. You succeed in avoiding much in the way of policy recommendations.ADThat said, the draft report raises more questions than it answers. Some of these questions cannot be resolved \u2014 but some of them should be wrestled with further before publishing your final draft. In particular:1) Why the special emphasis on property rights and religious freedom? The sentence that has garnered the most attention: \u201cForemost among the unalienable rights that government is established to secure, from the founders\u2019 point of view, are property rights and religious liberty.\u201d Secretary Pompeo stressed this in his speech as well. You further elaborate that \u201cfor the founders, property refers not only to physical goods and the fruit of one\u2019s labor but also encompasses life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.\u201d ADThis is odd for several reasons. First, there are obvious elements of liberty in particular that are disconnected from any conventional understanding of property rights concept. The First Amendment right to peaceably assemble, for example, seems like a core aspect of liberty and yet does not quite work as a property right per se.ADSecond, you pretty much fail to back up the preeminence of either property rights or religious liberty in the rest of your report. There is a paragraph or two tying them to the Declaration of Independence \u2014 and then both of these unalienable rights disappear from the rest of the report. Your claim appears to rest on little more than your assertion. This is particularly odd because later on in the document, you refer to rights that are \u201cfundamental\u201d and \u201ccore concept\u201d and \u201cabsolute or nearly so\u201d rights. In none of these instances, however, are you referencing your core unalienable rights, but rather the right to vote, human dignity and the genocide prohibition. In other places, you reference economic and social rights but fail to connect them to the property rights that you hold dear. So I am completely unclear why your thesis paragraph is so unmoored from the rest of the document.AD2) Where\u2019s the evidence? The report is chock-full of passive, tentative claims like, \u201cThere is good reason to worry that the prodigious expansion of human rights has weakened rather than strengthened the claims of human rights and left the most disadvantaged more vulnerable,\u201d and \u201cThe surfeit of new treaty obligations in human rights does not seem to have increased the effectiveness of human rights law.\u201d ADWhere is your evidence to support these assertions? The draft report does not contain a single footnote or reference. The nice way to describe the empirical support in your text is that it is light. The less-nice way is to say that there are passages that read like an 11th-grade book report. Do more research! Add some relevant citations!AD3) You need to do a better job of acknowledging U.S. hypocrisy. It is unfortunate that Secretary Pompeo did not read this document closely. While bashing the 1619 Project and the like, he must have glossed over sections of this report, like: \u201cThe legally protected and institutionally entrenched slavery that disfigured the United States at its birth reduced fellow human beings to property to be bought, sold, and used as a means for their owners\u2019 benefit,\u201d and \u201cProgress toward the securing of rights for all has often been excruciatingly slow and has been interrupted by periods of lamentable backsliding.\u201d ADUnfortunately, you need to acknowledge American hypocrisy in one or two additional places. You lament, for example, that \u201csome of our closest traditional allies, especially in Europe, sometimes show greater eagerness to accommodate China and Russia for commercial reasons, than determination to oppose them by holding up the banner of human rights.\u201d You\u2019ll need to include the Trump administration on that score, too.4) Eliminate the conceptual sloppiness. Stop using the term \u201cnation-state\u201d \u2014 it doesn\u2019t mean what you think it means. Almost all of the sovereign jurisdictions in the world are not ethnically homogeneous. Just use \u201cstates.\u201d Don\u2019t describe the Helsinki Accords as \u201cextralegal,\u201d they are an example of \u201csoft law.\u201d Speaking of which, you rubbish the \u201csoft law\u201d concept and stress the importance of settled law and treaties but later state that \u201cnot every moral imperative and political priority need be translated into juridical form to demonstrate U.S. seriousness of purpose regarding human rights.\u201d Which is it? AD5) What is your purpose? In the report, you note that, \u201cthe widespread proliferation of nonlegal standards \u2014 drawn up by commissions and committees, bodies of independent experts, NGOs, special rapporteurs, etc., with scant democratic oversight \u2014 gives rise to serious concerns.\u201d You are one of those commissions. To be blunt, why should the reader pay more attention to you than to these other bodies? This is an uneven first effort. You have some serious revisions to hammer out.

Subscribe today.arrow-rightAfter almost a year of work, the commission releases its report to the public Thursday at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia. Some say the report\u2019s timing couldn\u2019t be worse. I say the timing couldn\u2019t be better.ADNever before have America\u2019s founding principles been under such relentless assault. For decades, our institutions of higher education have sought to debunk or disown them. Last summer, the New York Times  launched the 1619 Project, which contends that the essence of America is entwined with slavery and racism. In recent weeks, justified outrage at the actions of a rogue Minneapolis policeman has given way to outrageous efforts to erase American history by tearing down statues of our nation\u2019s founders.ADNever has knowledge of our founding principles been more urgent. As President Trump has recognized, we face many mighty challenges from abroad. Ruled with an iron fist by the Chinese Communist Party, for instance, China seeks to remake the world in its autocratic image and subordinate other nations to its hegemonic ambitions. We can\u2019t confront Beijing or other gross human rights violators throughout the world without understanding the roots of our foreign policy, though the lens of our Founders\u2019 intent.Just when unity of purpose is called for, confusion sweeps the land about the convictions that undergird our great experiment in ordered liberty. Some of our best-educated and most highly credentialed citizens have lost sight of the fundamental difference between autocracies, which subordinate the individual to the will of a dictator, and liberal democracies, whose overriding purpose \u2014 notwithstanding their inevitable shortcomings and constant need for vigilance and reform \u2014 is to enable individuals, families and communities to flourish.ADFreedom has always been at the center of the American political order. The Declaration of Independence proclaims that every human being is endowed with certain unalienable rights, such as life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness; that governments are instituted to secure these rights; and that all legitimate power springs from the consent of the governed. The Constitution structures our fundamental political institutions to provide the energy and flexibility to secure rights while circumscribing the exercise of political power to prevent government from violating rights. And the American political tradition records the continuing struggle to honor the nation\u2019s founding promise.ADFreedom has always been at the center of American diplomacy. In the republic\u2019s early years, Presidents George Washington and Thomas Jefferson urged the nation to protect the American people\u2019s freedom by avoiding, in Jefferson\u2019s words, \u201centangling alliances.\u201d In 1823, President James Monroe declared that to safeguard liberty and individual rights at home, the nation must protect the Western Hemisphere from the unfree forms of government that then characterized Europe.Two years earlier, his secretary of state, John Quincy Adams, asserted in a July 4 address that the United States speaks \u201cthe language of equal liberty, of equal justice, and of equal rights. . . . But she goes not abroad, in search of monsters to destroy. She is the well-wisher to the freedom and independence of all. She is the champion and vindicator of her own.\u201d ADThe 19th and 20th centuries brought great changes. Two world wars and successive revolutions in transportation and communications shrank the globe, leaving nations vastly more interconnected and interdependent. The United States was compelled to revise its diplomacy, the better to honor its founding principles. In 1948, the U.N. General Assembly, with the United States taking a leading role, passed the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Although it inspired human rights treaties to which the United States is signatory, the UDHR is not itself binding law. Rather, it establishes \u201ca common standard of achievement for all peoples and all nations.\u201d ADSince 1948, presidents of both parties have insisted that the United States must champion human rights abroad. But hard questions abound: What is the connection between the nation\u2019s constitutional system and its international obligations? How do we apply old rights to new circumstances and assess the validity of new rights claims? How do we balance the commitment to champion human rights with diplomacy\u2019s complex and multifarious demands?By recovering our nation\u2019s founding principles \u2014 and elaborating them in that spirit of toleration and civility on which constitutional government depends \u2014 the State Department\u2019s Commission on Unalienable Rights enables the nation to better answer these always-pressing questions and thereby makes an important contribution to securing freedom.

What\u2019s the plan?It has to do with giving expanded rights to Hong Kong residents with unique travel documents known as British National (Overseas), or BNO, passports, and to those considered to be eligible for them. The U.K. created the passports before handing Hong Kong back to China in 1997. They allowed holders to visit the U.K. visa-free for up to six months, but didn\u2019t automatically confer the right to live or work there. Holders also weren\u2019t eligible to access public funds.AD2. What\u2019s changing?U.K. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab told the House of Commons on July 1 that a new \u201cbespoke immigration route\u201d will allow holders of BNO status to come to the U.K. without the current six-month limit. They will be allowed to stay and work in the U.K. for five years. After that period, they can apply for settled status and, after a further 12 months with that status, for citizenship. Family dependents will also be allowed into the U.K. and there will be no limit on the numbers allowed to apply.AD3. Who will be eligible?There were about 350,000 holders of BNO passports as of February, according to the U.K. Home Office. Others born before the July 1, 1997 handover were eligible to apply before that date, however, and the U.K. Home Office says it estimates there are \u201caround 2.9 million BNOs currently in Hong Kong.\u201d That\u2019s almost 40% of the population. Those born after the handover are not eligible.AD4. Why is the U.K. doing this?U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said China\u2019s imposition of the national security law was a \u201cclear and serious breach\u201d of the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration that paved the way for Hong Kong\u2019s return to China in 1997. Speaking in the House of Commons on July 1, he said he\u2019d made clear that if China continued down this path, Britain would introduce a new route for those with BNO status to enter the U.K. \u201cThat is precisely what we will do now,\u201d he said. In an interview with Sky News on June 3, Raab said the U.K. was prepared to sacrifice a free trade deal with China to protect Hong Kong citizens.AD5. What has the reaction been from China?ADThe Chinese Embassy in London said on July 1 the U.K. had previously promised \u201cit will not confer the right of abode to Chinese citizens in Hong Kong who hold BNO passports.\u201d All Chinese compatriots living in Hong Kong count as Chinese nationals, the Embassy said. \u201cIf the British side makes unilateral changes to the relevant practice, it will breach its own position and pledges as well as international law and basic norms guiding international relations.\u201d6. Why didn\u2019t Hong Kong people get regular British passports?People born in Hong Kong after the 1997 handover, who were both Chinese citizens and permanent Hong Kong residents, became eligible for the new Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) passports. While then-Conservative Prime Minister John Major cited Britain\u2019s \u201ccontinuing responsibilities to the people of Hong Kong\u201d in a speech in the city in March 1996, at the same time there was concern within his Tory party back home about the potential scale of arrivals from Hong Kong, according to Jonathan Dimbleby in his book \u201cThe Last Governor.\u201dADAD7. How would Britain handle a large influx now?The government doesn\u2019t expect one. Raab told lawmakers in June that he had held talks with the U.K.\u2019s so-called Five Eyes security allies, the U.S., Canada, Australia and New Zealand, on the potential for sharing the burden of migrants. He said in July he expects \u201ca large number\u201d of those who are eligible to remain in Hong Kong or move elsewhere in the region, while also conceding there would be little the British authorities could do if China tried to block people from Hong Kong traveling to the U.K. Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said his cabinet is \u201cvery actively\u201d considering offering Hong Kong citizens safe haven, but didn\u2019t provide details on how that would be arranged.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P.", "comment": "0 Comments", "topic": "Business"}, {"cover": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/KHF6CXV4QEI6VDHVTQNY274EYY.jpghttps://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/KHF6CXV4QEI6VDHVTQNY274EYY.jpg", "title": "India isn\u2019t just fracturing the Internet with its ban on Chinese apps.

Subscribe today.arrow-rightIndia\u2019s government banned 59 Chinese mobile apps, including TikTok and WeChat,  week, seemingly in retaliation for the killing of at least 20 of its soldiers along the disputed border between the countries high in the Himalayas. The reason provided was national security; officials said in a statement that the programs were \u201cstealing and surreptitiously transmitting users\u2019 data\u201d to servers outside India. The initial announcement was more sweeping: The barred services were \u201cprejudicial to sovereignty and integrity of India, defence of India, security of state and public order.\u201dCyber sovereignty has long been a central component of the Chinese government\u2019s approach to the Web, an approach it has been advocating to the rest of the world. Every nation, the thinking goes, ought to exercise control over the flow of information within its borders \u2014 and into or out of them, too. Every country, including democratic states, has an interest in some restrictions on an otherwise open Internet: rules against illegal material such as child exploitation imagery, for example, or the prohibition of tools that pose cybersecurity risks. Yet many of the demands of authoritarian governments, justified in the name of techno-nationalism, are intended to constrict free expression and communication. These range from the wholesale blocking of global websites to insistence that data be stored locally.ADADViewed in this light, India\u2019s decision is both understandable and alarming. Answering China\u2019s provocations with economic rather than military measures is the responsible thing to do, and China set the stage for the splintering of the global Web when it erected its Great Firewall. Nor is it unreasonable for India to suspect that Chinese apps are transmitting data to that country\u2019s government \u2014 maybe not as a matter of course, but certainly if officials demand it. TikTok is under a national security review in the United States over precisely that concern. Yet going through a process to determine whether a specific risk exists for a specific company is different from cutting off access to dozens of services in one fell swoop as part of a physical turf war. What India has done turns its citizens\u2019 access to information and the outside world into a geopolitical game chip to be leveraged against another country.Almost one-third of TikTok\u2019s downloads came from India. This action will hurt China, in other words, but also more than 120 million Indians \u2014 not to mention the users of those 58 other apps. And though China\u2019s short-term interest may have been harmed, its long-term goal of a fractured Internet has been served. For those who live in countries inclined to ban Web services from abroad, this fracturing of the Internet isn\u2019t only a fracturing. It\u2019s a shrinking, too.Read more: The Post\u2019s View: TikTok and the long arm of the Chinese governmentThe Post\u2019s View: Could TikTok allow China to export repression?Barkha Dutt: The inside story of how India and China came to blows in the HimalayasBarkha Dutt: A deadly border clash should end India\u2019s delusions about ChinaMolly Roberts: Gen Z\u2019s strategy to ruin Trump\u2019s rally looks a little too familiar", "comment": "0 Comments", "topic": "The Post's View"}, {"cover": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/OM7EOCWCYYI6VCIINCRLT2XJ4A.jpghttps://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/OM7EOCWCYYI6VCIINCRLT2XJ4A.jpg", "title": "Millions watched an Indian man eat chicken legs on TikTok until the app was banned", "date": "Jul 10, 2020", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/india-tiktok-ban-chicken-leg-piece/2020/07/10/46b79598-c0a4-11ea-8908-68a2b9eae9e0_story.html", "keyword": "China and Security", "website": "the Washington Post", "author": "Niha Masih", "content": "NEW DELHI \u2014 Ulhas Kamathe\u2019s life changed when he started eating chicken legs on TikTok.Every day, millions of people watched the 41-year-old gym owner from Mumbai wolf down his favorite food and describe it in his characteristic style: \u201cchicken leg bis,\u201d or chicken leg piece.

President Trump has often blamed China for the worsening situation of the novel coronavirus in the United States and has barred U.S. companies from doing business with Chinese technology company Huawei. This week, Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the United States is considering banning some Chinese apps.Owned by the Chinese business ByteDance, TikTok has been downloaded more than 2 billion times worldwide. Its biggest star is an American teenager from Connecticut. More than 40 percent of its users are under 24.TikTok\u2019s rise in India has been fueled in part by millions of first-time Internet users. At the beginning of the decade, an estimated 20 million people in the country had access to the Internet. In 2018, that figure had swelled to 560\u00a0million. India is also the second-largest smartphone market in the world and has the cheapest data prices. With 200\u00a0million users on TikTok, \u00adIndia was its biggest market outside of China.The app became a symbol of the aspirations of the country\u2019s fast-growing young population. Millions of users from small-town India logged in to channel their creative fantasies, no matter how absurd. More important, it provided them quick fame and money \u2014 a rare prize in the country of more than 1.3 billion people.\u00a0The father of two teenagers, Kamathe was confounded by his success. For more than a year, he had danced and sung songs on the app without registering a blip. His big moment came after he began filming and describing his meals. Offers poured in from hotels to feature them, and colleges invited him to festivals.

But Democrats and Republicans roundly dismissed that idea immediately.AD\u201cThis terrible virus is still with us.

Late Thursday, they were still fighting over whether to include a demand by Sen. Lindsey O.

Marco Rubio (R-Fla.).ADAs differences intensified and next week\u2019s deadline neared, the White House agreed to scrap President Trump\u2019s demand to include a payroll tax cut in the package after the provision was met with fierce resistance by Republicans.Stay safe and informed with our free Coronavirus Updates newsletterThe delays on Capitol Hill came amid more grim developments about the coronavirus\u2019s fierce grip on the United States and its economy. There have been 4 million confirmed U.S. cases of the virus, far more than any other country. More than 140,000 people have died, including 3,000 since Tuesday. In addition, 1.4 million people filed for unemployment benefits last week, up from 1.3 million the week before, the first time there was a week-over-week increase in several months.ADHouse Democrats passed a $3 trillion measure in May to send Americans new stimulus checks and help cities and states, but the White House and Senate Republicans delayed negotiations until recent days. Since then, they have floundered over what the package should look like. They had said they wanted the package to be roughly $1 trillion, but the GOP plan has fueled fierce internal divisions about the size and scope of the government response as lawmakers have digested grim polling news about the party\u2019s standing ahead of the November elections.ADMnuchin and White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows emerged from a morning meeting with McConnell to insist there was \u201cfundamental agreement\u201d on the overall deal. But they then immediately said it might make more sense to break the bill into multiple pieces so they could address the expiring unemployment benefits.Democrats and Republicans immediately shot down the idea.AD\u201cNo, no, no,\u201d House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said. \u201cThis is a package. We cannot piecemeal this.\u201dComplicating matters, the White House renewed its push for language related to the location of the Federal Bureau of Investigation building in downtown Washington \u2014 which is cater-cornered from Trump International Hotel on Pennsylvania Ave NW \u2014 according to two people with knowledge of the talks who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss them. Trump has expressed interest in the location of the FBI\u2019s headquarters for some time.ADThe details were unclear, but the Trump administration previously scrapped a plan to move the FBI headquarters to the suburbs, instead seeking to rebuild a new FBI building in its current location. It was unclear what this had to do with the coronavirus. Trump said Thursday he wanted the FBI to be able to rebuild at the current site. He even mentioned the possibility of installing a running track on top of the building because \u201cFBI people like to work out a lot.\u201dADHe said, though, that the language might not make it in this bill and could be addressed at a later date.In his floor speech McConnell said the GOP proposal would include a new round of stimulus checks, aid for schools, money for testing, changes to unemployment assistance rules, more money for small businesses, and liability reform setting up legal protections to make it hard for employees to sue their employers if they become sick at work. Democrats have rejected this last idea as a nonstarter.One of the few things that was ironed out was an agreement to jettison any payroll tax cut from the final deal. Trump had insisted that this payroll tax cut be included and suggested he might not sign a bill unless it was included, but Senate Republicans refused his plea and the White House acknowledged defeat Thursday. Trump attempted to blame Democrats in a Twitter post, but it was Republicans who actually shot down the idea.The broad outlines of the shifting GOP proposal would replace the expiring unemployment benefits with a new arrangement that pays jobless Americans roughly $200 per week instead of $600 on top of the state benefit. In March, Congress approved an additional $600 weekly benefit for unemployed Americans, but it is set to expire next week. The unemployment rate in June was 11.1 percent, down from its high several months ago but still higher than at any point during the financial crisis.ADAD\u201cWe don\u2019t want this to expire next Friday,\u201d Mnuchin said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a difficult concept. You don\u2019t get paid more to stay home than you do when you have a job.\u201dDemocrats want to extend the $600 payment through January.The retreat on the payroll tax idea marked a big setback for the White House.\u201cThe president is very focused on getting money quickly to workers right now and the payroll tax takes time, so we\u2019ll come back and look at that later,\u201d Mnuchin told reporters at the Capitol.He said the decision was made to instead focus on sending another round of stimulus checks to Americans, because that approach would put money in people\u2019s pockets more quickly.ADStephen Moore, a conservative economist who advised on Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign, said he was \u201cvery discouraged\u201d that the GOP package would leave out the payroll tax cut but include the $1,200 stimulus payments, arguing the president risked alienating his conservative base over the move.AD\u201cWe\u2019ve gone in less than 10 days from Trump saying that he won\u2019t sign a bill without a payroll tax cut to the bill they\u2019re drafting not having a payroll tax cut,\u201d Moore said. \u201cThere is no benefit from dumping money from helicopters into people\u2019s laps.\u201dDemocrats and Republicans had already supported sending another round of stimulus checks, and now that idea appears to be one of a few areas where there is bipartisan support.Coronavirus live updatesDemocrats slammed Republicans for the delay in releasing their legislation.AD\u201cOur Republican colleagues have been so divided, so disorganized and so unprepared that they have to struggle to draft even a partisan proposal within their own conference before they talk to a single Democrat,\u201d Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) said on the Senate floor. \u201cIt appears the Republican legislative response to covid is un-unified, unserious and unsatisfactory.\u201dADThe emerging GOP bill also was expected to include $70 billion for elementary and secondary schools, with half of that money connected to schools physically reopening their classrooms. No new money for state and local governments was expected, but instead the legislation would allow local leaders more flexibility in spending $150 billion allocated in the Cares Act in March. Tax credits were expected to encourage businesses to retain workers and help them enact safety protections in workplaces. Another round of funding for the small-business Paycheck Protection Program was also expected.Trump pushes payroll tax cut while GOP eyes benefit cuts for unemployedElection-year politics have complicated the talks as a handful of vulnerable senators up for reelection push for more generous spending, while fiscal conservatives in the Senate GOP conference oppose spending any more money after Congress already pumped about $3 trillion into the economy in March and April.", "comment": "0 Comments", "topic": "Economic Policy"}, {"cover": "", "title": "Putin and Trump discuss arms control issues in phone call", "date": "Jul 23, 2020", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/putin-and-trump-discuss-arms-control-issues-in-phone-call/2020/07/23/ab106e18-cd13-11ea-99b0-8426e26d203b_story.html", "keyword": "China and Security", "website": "the Washington Post", "author": "", "content": "MOSCOW \u2014 Russian President Vladimir Putin and U.S. President Donald Trump discussed arms control and cooperation in fighting the coronavirus during a phone call between the two leaders Thursday, the Kremlin and White House said.Support our journalism.

Playing out against the backdrop of a pandemic, a worldwide recession, the U.S.-China battle for trade supremacy and the American presidential election, there couldn\u2019t be more at stake. But Brazilian Director-General Roberto Azevedo\u2019s decision to step down at the end of August, a year before his term ends, also offers an opportunity for the U.S., the European Union and other nations to reshape the organization.Support our journalism. Subscribe today.arrow-right1. What\u2019s at stake?The Geneva-based WTO\u2019s mission of economic integration is under threat from protectionist policies around the globe, and without reform it risks being sidelined during the biggest economic crisis in a century. The world\u2019s largest economies agree that the organization must evolve to address the shifts in technology and the global trading system that have occurred since 1995. If members can align behind a candidate committed to modernization, it could break bureaucratic logjams and help unleash a wave of global growth at a time when it is needed most. If no such candidate can be found, the WTO risks further receding into irrelevance.ADAD2. What\u2019s precipitated the crisis?The WTO\u2019s appellate body, the main forum for settling worldwide trade disagreements, lost its ability in December 2019 to rule on new dispute cases. That resulted from a U.S. refusal over the previous two years to consider any nominees to fill vacancies on the panel. WTO members can still bring disputes to the trade body and receive an initial ruling, but that can be appealed into legal limbo. The U.S. imposition of hundreds of billions of dollars worth of tariffs against China, and use of the WTO\u2019s national security loophole to levy duties on steel and aluminum, have also weakened the organization.3. What is the WTO\u2019s selection process?ADThe chairman of the WTO General Council launched a selection procedure in June to confirm the trade body\u2019s next director-general. WTO members had sought to truncate the six-month process into just three in order to avoid a leadership vacuum in September, but it\u2019s likely a new candidate won\u2019t be selected until after the U.S. presidential election in November. During this time, the candidates will present themselves to the WTO\u2019s membership, campaign for support and sit for a question-and-answer session with the WTO General Council. Then the WTO\u2019s three highest-ranking delegates, known as \u201cthe troika,\u201d will consult with the membership and try to build a consensus around a final candidate.AD4. Who is running?\u2022 Jesus Seade Kuri, Mexico\u2019s chief negotiator of USMCA and a former WTO deputy director-generalAD\u2022 Hamid Mamdouh, an Egyptian attorney at King & Spalding LLP and former services division director at the WTO\u2022 Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, Nigeria\u2019s former finance minister and former managing director of the World Bank\u2022 Tudor Ulianovschi, Moldova\u2019s former minister of foreign affairs.\u2022 Yoo Myung-hee, South Korea\u2019s trade minister.5. Who\u2019s not?\u2022 EU Trade Commissioner Phil Hogan\u2022 Former EU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom\u2022 Canadian Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland\u2022 Dutch Foreign Trade Minister Sigrid Kaag6. What credentials are required?WTO rules require candidates to have \u201cextensive experience in international relations, encompassing economic, trade and/or political experience; a firm commitment to the work and objectives of the WTO; proven leadership and managerial ability; and demonstrated communications skills.\u201dADAD7. What kind of leader are nations looking for?Governments hope the next WTO director-general can persuade members to complete the much-needed reform of the organization. Trade officials in Geneva broadly argue that Azevedo\u2019s successor should have sufficient leadership authority and capability to marshal broad support around the WTO\u2019s reform agenda. That means strong consideration should be given to candidates who have, at the very least, some experience as a minister.8. Is there a nationality requirement?No. However, trade officials from the U.S., EU and Canada say the next WTO director-general should come from a developed country due to their belief that the organization\u2019s leadership should rotate between developed and developing countries. Not all delegates agree on this, however, and representatives from African nations argue that it\u2019s their continent\u2019s turn to take on the top mantle of the WTO.ADAD9. Should a woman lead the WTO?There is a strong push among Geneva trade delegates to select a woman to lead the WTO for the first time. However, free-trade advocates like Wendy Cutler, vice president of the Washington-based Asia Society Policy Institute, argue that WTO members should try to avoid placing gender constraints on the selection process.10. Are there any other considerations?The candidate must also thread a narrow diplomatic needle that displeases neither the U.S. nor China, whose bitter conflict over the pandemic is testing their fragile economic truce. The Trump administration has actively sought to undermine the WTO\u2019s ability to function, saying it has infringed on American sovereignty and enabled China to become a big economic player globally at the expense of U.S. jobs and manufacturing. Adding to the unpredictability factor, President Donald Trump -- who has called the WTO the worst trade deal the U.S. has ever signed -- is up for re-election in November, so America\u2019s tolerance for a candidate who looks too favorably on China might be tested. Meanwhile, China has engaged in a multi-year campaign to expand its diplomatic influence by installing key personnel at the top levels of international decision making bodies.11. What happens if no candidate is selected?One of the WTO\u2019s four deputy directors-general may serve as an interim caretaker if the WTO\u2019s members cannot agree on a consensus nominee by Sept. 1. They are Yonov Frederick Agah of Nigeria, Karl Brauner of Germany, Alan Wolff of the U.S. and Yi Xiaozhun of China.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P.", "comment": "0 Comments", "topic": "Business"}, {"cover": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/53MSGIWB4QI6VCIINCRLT2XJ4A.jpghttps://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/53MSGIWB4QI6VCIINCRLT2XJ4A.jpg", "title": "The Technology 202: Pressure mounts for more Silicon Valley companies to undertake civil rights audits", "date": "Jul 9, 2020", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/the-technology-202-pressure-mounts-for-more-silicon-valley-companies-to-undertake-civil-rights-audits/2020/07/09/f302a570-4fc2-4005-b3c2-93c0d432dfb9_story.html", "keyword": "China and Security", "website": "the Washington Post", "author": "Cat Zakrzewski", "content": "Facebook just received a scathing report from auditors reviewing its record on civil rights.

NY)The novel coronavirus is showing some signs of mutating in a way that may make it easier to spread, according to Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases.ADResearch currently underway suggests a single mutation is emerging that lets the virus replicate better and create a higher viral load, measures that could make it easier to transmit, Fauci said at an online event Thursday hosted by the Journal of the American Medical Association.There is some dispute about the findings and it\u2019s not clear whether people who become infected with a newer variation of the pathogen fare worse than those with the original strain, he said. \u201cIt just seems that the virus replicates better and may be more transmissible,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is still at the stage of trying to confirm that.\u201dADModerna Sets Human Trial for Vaccine (1:40 p.m. NY)ADDrug-maker Moderna Inc. said a 30,000-patient trial of its Covid-19 vaccine candidate will start late this month, although a Stats News article earlier Thursday said the work had been expected to begin next week.

Subscribe today.arrow-rightThe Great American Outdoors Act will funnel millions of dollars a year into expanding and maintaining both remote wilderness areas and urban playgrounds. Bipartisan passage of the legislation comes at a time when access to the outdoors is more desired than ever in the middle of a pandemic that has closed down so many indoor spaces.\u201cWe are judged on what we choose to pass on,\u201d Rep. Ra\u00fal Grijalva (D-Ariz.), chair of the House Natural Resources Committee, said on the House floor before the measure's passage. \u201cFor too long we have allowed our national parks to fall into disrepair.\u201dADThe bill was approved in a 310-to-107 vote.The package is one of the most consequential environmental bills to pass Congress in decades.It would put $900 million a year into the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF), a popular but perennially underfunded program that pays for adding acreage and improving amenities in public lands.ADIt would also kick-start a new, $9.5 billion initiative for fixing worn-out trails, potholed roads and other infrastructure in national parks, forests and wildlife refuges that collectively face a $20 billion backlog of maintenance work.The Senate has already passed the bill by a 73-to-25 margin. And shortly before the House vote, President Trump called for passage of the bill.Normally Republicans and Democrats disagree on environmental policy. But this bill has broad bipartisan support.Liberals like seeing more money invested in building parks and protecting wildlife habitat. Conservatives are pleased it is paid for not directly by taxpayers, but by oil and gas companies through the royalties the government collects on drilling and mining on federal lands and waters.AD\u201cIt's very unusual for the Senate to get 73 votes for the time of day, let alone for a major piece of legislation,\u201d Sen. Angus King (I-Maine), who caucuses with Democrats, said last month.ADNearly every environmental organization backs the bill. \u201cPassing the Great American Outdoors Act is quite simply the most significant investment in conservation in decades,\" said Collin O\u2019Mara, head of the National Wildlife Federation. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge win for wildlife, our natural treasures, our economy, and all Americans, who enjoy our America\u2019s public lands for solace, recreation, and exercise, especially amid this pandemic.\u201dSo too does the petroleum sector, happy to share credit for improving iconic parks such as Yellowstone and Yosemite, which attract millions of visitors a year.AD\u201cWe prefer the funds stay out West where the vast majority of public lands are,\u201d said Kathleen Sgamma, head of the Western Energy Alliance, an oil and gas trade group. \u201cWe would like to be a major source of national parks funding.\u201dThe bill is now virtually guaranteed to become law. But its passage looked unlikely just a year ago.Back then, President Trump\u2019s White House proposed to almost entirely eliminating LWCF's funding.\u00a0ADAnd Trump and Congress let authorization for the fund lapse during the partial government shutdown at the beginning of 2019.The shutdown helped \u201cgalvanize the grass roots\u201d to put extra pressure on Congress to fund the program, according to Land Tawney, head of the Backcountry Hunters and Anglers, a conservation group in Montana.The upcoming election did a lot to change the calculus for Republicans.Cory Gardner of Colorado and Steve Daines of Montana, two GOP senators with plenty of public lands back home that could use the money, both face tough reelection races in November. Two Democrats who have already won statewide office \u2014 former Colorado governor John Hickenlooper and current Montana Gov. Steve Bullock \u2014 are running to succeed them.ADThe pair also face shifting economies out West, where more money is made by drawing tourists to the mountains than by extracting their resources. By 2015, the recreation sector, including hotels and restaurants, became a bigger part of Colorado\u2019s economy than the drilling and mining industry, according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis.ADAs Darryl Fears and I reported last week, Gardner and Daines met with Trump in February in the White House Roosevelt Room \u2014 named for the party\u2019s original conservationist \u2014 and flattered the president by saying he could be remembered like Roosevelt if he signed the bill.\u201cThis is not about politics for me,\u201d Daines said in June. \u201cMontanans love the outdoors. I grew up fishing, hiking, hunting. I still do it today.\u201dThe bill still has its detractors among conservatives.Some conservative lawmakers think land agencies already struggle to manage the vast acreage they have. And some lawmakers from around the Gulf of Mexico wanted more money to go toward coastal restoration in the populated, hurricane-battered region made more vulnerable by climate change.ADRep. Rob Bishop (Utah), top Republican on the House Natural Resources Committee, unsuccessfully sought to delay a vote over concerns about how an 84 percent decline in federal offshore oil royalty revenue during the pandemic could hamper conservation programs.ADIn a statement, Bishop said \u201cit would be ludicrous for House Democrats to move forward with this bill without amendment.\u201dPower playsThe Environmental Protection Agency proposed setting its first greenhouse gas standards for airplanes, at the same level that the industry is already on track to meet.Environmentalists had threatened to sue the Trump administration unless it imposed limits in line with what the International Civil Aviation Organization finalized in 2017. The U.S. airline industry is on track to meet those targets, which require new aircraft in 2028 to be 4 percent more fuel efficient compared to those in 2015.\u00a0\u201cThis is the third time in the past two years that this administration has taken major action to regulate greenhouse gases in a way that is legally defensible, reduces CO2 and protects American jobs,\u201d\u00a0EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler told reporters during a teleconference Wednesday. The EPA has revised two federal climate rules adopted under President Barack Obama, targeting power plants and vehicles, to make them less stringent.ADADWheeler said the standards are based on \u201cwhere the technology is today,\u201d and another agency official said EPA does not project that the proposed rule, in and of itself, will reduce the industry\u2019s overall carbon footprint.\u00a0\u00a0Groups such as the Center for Biological Diversity, which filed notice of intent to sue at the start of the year, said the proposal did not go far enough in curbing carbon pollution from air travel, which accounts for 2.5 percent of the world\u2019s total emissions. The ICAO projects those emissions will triple by mid-century.\u201cThis toothless proposal does nothing to meaningfully address the serious problem of airplanes\u2019 planet-warming pollution,\u201d said Clare Lakewood, the center\u2019s climate legal director.AD-Juliet EilperinThe Sierra Club is denouncing the racism of its founder John Muir.\u00a0Muir is critical to the history of environmental conservation and is known as the \u201cpatron saint of the American wilderness\u201d and the \u201cfather of the national parks.\u201d\u00a0\u201cBut on Wednesday, citing the current racial reckoning, the group announced it will end its blind reverence to a figure who was also racist,\u201d Darryl Fears and Steven Mufson report.\u00a0Michael Brune, the group's executive director, said \u201cit\u2019s time to take down some of our own monuments, starting with some truth-telling about the Sierra Club\u2019s early history.\u201d Muir, who fought to preserve Yosemite Valley and Sequoia National Forest, once referred to African Americans as lazy \u2018Sambos,\u2019 a racist pejorative that many black people consider to be even more offensive than the n-word.\u201dADADThe Sierra Club\u2019s efforts to speak out against its founder come as other environmental groups are dealing with their own reckonings. \u201cLeaders of predominantly white, liberal and progressive groups throughout the field of conservation say they are taking a hard look within their organizations and don\u2019t like what they see,\u201d Darryl and Steven write. \u201cAfrican American and other minority employees are pointing out the lack of diversity in green groups and the racial bias that persists in top and mid-level management.\u201d\u00a0Secretary of State Mike Pompeo stressed the U.S. interest in the Arctic during a visit to Denmark.\u00a0\u201cMany Danes remain suspicious of U.S. interest in the Arctic, and Pompeo\u2019s meeting Wednesday with the foreign ministers of Greenland and the Faroe Islands underscored U.S. aims to build closer ties, while edging out competition from China and Russia,\u201d Florian Elabdi and John Hudson report.But there was no discussion of buying Greenland, following Trump's signaled interest in purchasing the island last year.\u00a0ADDanish Foreign Minister Jeppe Kofod said the four foreign policy chiefs discussed \u201chow we can strengthen our cooperation on a whole range of areas.\u201d\u00a0\u201cWe are, as I said, each other\u2019s closest allies when it comes to security in the Arctic, North Atlantic, we are true partners, and we will continue to be that,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we also have unexplored potential to grow trade, tourism, education cooperation and other types of cooperation between us.\u201dDemocrats in the Ohio House want a nuclear plant bailout law repealed following an alleged bribery scandal.\u00a0\u201cThe announcement came a day after Larry Householder, the Republican speaker of the Ohio House, and four associates were arrested in a $60 million federal bribery case connected to the taxpayer-funded bailout,\u201d the Associated Press reports. \u201c\u2026Householder was one of the driving forces behind the nuclear plants\u2019 financial rescue.

The study, published last week in Environmental Health Perspectives, is the first to look specifically at flaring.\u201d\u00a0The study\u2019s lead author Lara Cushing, an assistant professor of environmental health sciences at the University of California, said the findings are \u201con par with the increased risk you see for women who smoke.\u201d But unlike smoking, \u201cit\u2019s not really something you can do much about on an individual level.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0A new study points to the increasing likelihood that human-driven carbon emissions can lead to irreversible damage to the Earth.\u00a0\u201cResearchers studying one of the most important and vexing topics in climate science \u2014 how sensitive the Earth\u2019s climate is to a doubling of the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere \u2014 found that warming is extremely unlikely to be on the low end of estimates,\u201d Andrew Freedman and Chris Mooney report. \u201cThese scientists now say it is likely that if human activities \u2014 such as burning oil, gas and coal along with deforestation \u2014 push carbon dioxide to such levels, the Earth\u2019s global average temperature will most likely increase between 4.1 to 8.1 degrees Fahrenheit (2.3 and 4.5 degrees Celsius).\u201d\u00a0Kate Marvel, a physicist at NASA\u2019s Goddard Institute of Space Studies and Columbia University, said even if warming reaches the midpoint of the narrower range, it would be extremely damaging to the planet.\u00a0Oil checkSome banks are selling off energy loans and slashing credit lines to oil and gas firms, wary of the pandemic\u2019s impact on the industry.\u00a0\u201cHancock Whitney, a regional bank with six branches in Houston, recently said it will sell $497 million in energy loans to Los Angeles-based Oaktree Capital Management in a deal that the bank said will \u2018significantly de-risk our balance sheet,\u2019 \u201d the Houston Chronicle reports. \u201c\u2026U.S. oil and gas companies, which have increasingly relied on banks to fund operations and new drilling, are finding it difficult to attract capital investment after years of lagging financial performance, accelerated by the recent oil bust caused by the global pandemic.\u201dAs the price of oil has plummeted, so has the value of oil and gas assets.\u00a0\u201cThe result has left energy companies without a lifeline as they struggle to weather the downturn in crude prices, slashing budgets and halting production,\u201d the Houston Chronicle adds.\u00a0Extra mileageThere was a rare coyote sighting in D.C. this week.\u00a0The wild coyote was seen in East Potomac Park in Southwest Washington on Tuesday, Dana Hedgpeth reports.\u201cOfficials with the National Park Service said on Twitter that it is \u2018rare\u2019 to see coyotes on the Mall.

When her two children are napping, she sits at the kitchen table in her 850-square-foot bungalow in Lawrence, Kan., opens her computer and dials strangers on her cellphone, hoping to trace the spread of the novel coronavirus in Wyandotte County.ADADSometimes she\u2019s able to gather good data for the health department, and to help recovering citizens navigate their way back to work, and she feels as if we\u2019re in this together.Sometimes people balk at the intrusion. A few weeks ago a man answered the phone while coughing and struggling to breathe. He told her \u201cdon\u2019t worry about me\u201d and hung up.\u201cThat made me so sad,\u201d says Sanchez, 32. \u201cI hope he\u2019s okay.\u201dLast week the county\u2019s contact tracers were 500 cases behind, she says, with 70 new ones piling up every day. She feels like a citizen trying her best, in a nation that isn\u2019t really doing the same.\u201cI don\u2019t know if anyone has biffed anything as bad as the federal government biffed their management of this,\u201d she says.This test of solidarity and public trust couldn\u2019t have come at a worse time. America\u2019s mask has slipped. There is a feeling of failure, of being repeatedly victimized by a virus despite our supposed exceptionalism. National pride in the United States has fallen to a record low, according to Gallup, and only 1 in 5 Americans is satisfied with the direction of the country \u2014 a steep drop from four months ago, when satisfaction was at a 15-year high. Forty-nine percent of whites \u2014 also a record low \u2014 say they are \u201cextremely proud\u201d to be an American; for nonwhite Americans the rate is half that.ADADPerhaps we ignored our preexisting conditions for too long. In 1979, Jimmy Carter admitted to a national \u201ccrisis of confidence,\u201d in the wake of Vietnam and Watergate and energy shortages. But then we shut our eyes and pictured Ronald Reagan\u2019s \u201cshining city,\u201d as wealth oozed upward. We believed Bill Clinton\u2019s pep talk about how our best qualities excused our worst, which included prioritizing mass incarceration. We cloaked George W. Bush\u2019s costly foreign policy in pageant-style patriotism and then believed Barack Obama\u2019s insistence that Americans were not as divided as we seemed. Meanwhile, big banks crashed the economy and got bailed out, white people in rural areas started dying \u201cdeaths of despair,\u201d black people kept getting killed by police at disproportionately high rates, and more Americans turned to conspiracy theories to make sense of it all and prescription pills to blunt the pain.Then a minority of voters elected as president a salesman who built his empire on fraud, spectacle and bankruptcy. Three years and 20,000 \u201cfalse or misleading claims\u201d later, the reality-show presidency is reaching a dramatic first-season climax marked by mass death, rampant joblessness, tens of millions of people in the streets.Josh Harrison is trying to ride it all out until November, hoping at least for a political cure. Harrison runs a small pest-control business in North Carolina and voted for Donald Trump in 2016. He regrets it mightily. This year was the breaking point, particularly when Trump suggested that perhaps the virus could be killed by injecting disinfectant into the body. Then, watching the lack of Republican leadership in the wake of Floyd\u2019s death, Harrison started questioning whether he even belonged in the party.ADADSo one night last month, after some red wine and White Claw, he sat on his deck about 2 a.m. and hit record on his phone. Shirtless and smoking a Marlboro Light, Harrison said that for the first time in his life he would be voting for a Democrat. Then he submitted the homemade video to Republican Voters Against Trump, which has been releasing similar testimonials. Harrison\u2019s video has since been viewed over 1.1 million times.\u201cTrump doesn\u2019t have to build a wall because Mexico is closing its border to us,\u201d he says by phone. \u201cWe can\u2019t travel. We\u2019re a laughingstock. The world is either laughing at us or pitying us.\u201dWhen Chris Wallace asked Trump about the death count on \u201cFox News Sunday,\u201d the president blamed China and said \u201cIt is what it is.\u201d\u201cYou can no longer pretend that \u2018the American century\u2019 isn\u2019t over,\u201d says Elizabeth Tandy Shermer, an associate professor of history at Loyola University Chicago. She views the years since 1968 as a cycle of recessions and widening inequality, debt and disenfranchisement that is only now becoming apparent to broader America \u2014 white America, moneyed America \u2014 because the pandemic and social media have made it impossible to ignore. Institutions have been deteriorating and failing us for generations, she says, but we rigged workarounds with our own social networks and mutual-aid groups. We made do. Then the pandemic scattered us, isolated us, exposed us for what we really are.\u201cAll these years after the Civil War, are we still just a union of states \u2014 or have we become a nation of people?\u201dADADThat\u2019s the question Shermer will ask the students in her U.S. history survey course. She\u2019s watched governors battle the president and states squabble over stocks of personal protective equipment. Meanwhile the movement of Black Lives Matter has behaved like a nation of people, demanding something more, something holistic, something that was promised centuries ago.The coronavirus is \u201cfueled upon the systemic injustices in our country,\u201d says Cedric Dark, an emergency-room physician and assistant professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston. The contagion doesn\u2019t just spread because of proximity or air droplets; it feeds on disparity in housing, insurance, transportation, wages, child care, food security. Our current failure is built on previous failures.Coronavirus is a test that no one knows how to passDark grades the U.S. response to our crises with a C-minus. \u201cI think some states are going to pass and some states are going to fail,\u201d he says. \u201cSo Georgia, Arizona, Florida and Texas are going to fail this test, until they listen.\u201dADADIn Texas, the volume of covid-19 cases is 10 times higher than it was in the spring, Dark says. Hospitalizations are seven times higher; deaths are five times higher. Last week, a man came into Dark\u2019s hospital worried about his low blood sugar. He had no covid-19 symptoms, but a check of his vitals revealed a blood-oxygen level of 89 percent: perilously low. An X-ray showed a white, fluffy buildup all over his lungs.\u201cIt\u2019s everywhere,\u201d Dark says. \u201cAnd everyone keeps claiming we\u2019re alarmist, but when we in the ER are panicking now, and telling you what we\u2019re going through, listen. Because we don\u2019t normally panic.\u201dThe next test that we\u2019ll pass or fail, according to Dark, is whether we send our children back to school. As a kind of trial run, Hannah Lebovits sent her two children to a day camp in Plano, Tex., the last week of June. The camp did everything right, she thought, but within two weeks the news arrived via email: one symptomatic child and multiple counselors had tested positive for covid-19.\u201cI knew it,\u201d says Lebovits, 27, an incoming assistant professor of public administration at the University of Texas at Arlington. \u201cI just knew it. I knew in my heart that this is what was going to happen.\u201dLebovits studies social sustainability, and how government creates or degrades it. Through the lens of her work, she sees this year\u2019s crises as a total failure of government and institutions.ADAD\u201cWe\u2019re being gaslit by this country that everything will be fine if we just get back to work,\u201d Lebovits says. \u201cWe\u2019re focused on economic stability, business revitalization, what the economy is going to look like after covid \u2014 not what we\u2019re going to look like after covid. My kids are going to need a s--- ton of therapy. I\u2019m going to need therapy. It\u2019s just overwhelming. I see this as impacting countless Americans for so long. I want to say a single decade, but it\u2019s going to be longer than that.\u201d The irrefutable evidence of mismanagement \u2014 the 140,000 deaths, the police violence across the country \u2014 has made many people realize that \u201cwe don\u2019t need to be nice to our institutions anymore.\u201dThe pandemic isn\u2019t over. But America sure seems over it.In his 1998 book \u201cThe American Century,\u201d Harold Evans wrote about the nation\u2019s \u201cinner light of freedom.\u201d Since then, he says, the pursuit of freedom has become reckless. Democracy has become transactional. An isolated America has plunged into a \u201cpermanent fog of war\u201d on its own turf.\u201cWe are reeling from the tsunami of lies and the images of outrage,\u201d Evans, 92, writes in an email from his home in the Hamptons. \u201cWhat has been inspiring to see is that Americans have cut through the mist to fight for justice and equality.\u201dADADIs America failing, or is it just changing?\u201cI learned America was a failure when I was 18 and they tried to talk to me about the electoral college,\u201d says D.C. resident Allison Lane, 34. \u201cI\u2019ve always felt this country wasn\u2019t made for me.\u201dLane woke up Saturday at her home in Columbia Heights and saw on Twitter that Rep. John Lewis had died. Here was a man, she thought, who had every reason to give up on institutions, on this country, and yet he fought and fought and fought. It made her think of her own journey this year. In March, she lost her job at a new restaurant downtown. She kept it together until May, when George Floyd was killed, and then fell apart. Floyd looked like her uncle. It was all too much. She was depressed by her deferred career, grieving Floyd\u2019s death, paralyzed by the pandemic. Then June 1 she pulled herself outside and walked with friends to the White House. Police corralled the crowds uptown, until Lane found herself pepper-sprayed and seeking shelter from officers, with dozens of other wheezing activists, in a stranger\u2019s home on Swann Street NW, in a pandemic.\u201cAnd my entire life changed,\u201d says Lane, who in the aftermath launched a nonprofit called Bartenders Against Racism. \u201cI\u2019ve operated in anger over this past month, but it wasn\u2019t that same old anger, where old Allison Lane would be like \u2018F--- all this.\u2019 It was: \u2018Let me organize my community.\u2019 And I think I\u2019m so emotional with John Lewis because that\u2019s what he did with his entire life.\u201dSo she is remaking a small part of this country, the country that wasn\u2019t made for her, into her own. Bartenders Against Racism is amplifying black voices and providing supplies and sustenance to protesters. On Saturday night, Lane and others lit 300 tea candles spread over Black Lives Matter Plaza, the stretch of 16th Street NW leading to the White House, in a vigil for John Lewis. It was like lighting a path to freedom, she thought, to a better America.A union of states, or a nation of people?American collapse, or American transformation?Lane talks of her new life of activism as an experiment. She might as well be talking about the country.\u201cI tell the team: I\u2019m failing literally every day,\u201d she says. \u201cEvery day I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing. That doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m not smart or won\u2019t figure it out.\u201d\n\n", "comment": "0 Comments", "topic": "Style"}, {"cover": "", "title": "These Loser Stocks Deserve a Lot More Love", "date": "Jul 23, 2020", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/these-loser-stocks-deserve-a-lot-more-love/2020/07/22/f0f1bc26-cc27-11ea-99b0-8426e26d203b_story.html", "keyword": "China and Security", "website": "the Washington Post", "author": "", "content": "Add the lackluster performance of defense stocks to the long list of puzzling inequities in the pandemic stock market.\u00a0A custom basket of top U.S. defense contractors within\u00a0the S&P 500 Index is down about 20% for the year, even as the broader benchmark pushed into the green this week.

Subscribe today.arrow-rightLockheed Martin Corp., which reported\u00a0second-quarter earnings on Tuesday, displayed\u00a0the sector\u2019s resilience\u00a0amid the pandemic upheaval. Earnings, sales and cash flow were all higher than the year-earlier period, with cash balances helped in part by accelerated progress payments from the Department of Defense that were then passed on to suppliers. At a time when most companies are hesitant to make any concrete predictions about the immediate future, Lockheed touted a record $150.3 billion backlog and actually raised its guidance on all fronts. And yet even after a respectable 2.6% gain on Tuesday\u2019s earnings report, Lockheed still trades at roughly 14 times its estimated earnings in 2021. The valuation discount to the broader S&P 500 is just shy of the widest spread in at least five years.Fellow defense contractors Raytheon Technologies Corp., General Dynamics Corp. and Northrop Grumman Corp. are scheduled to report results next week, as is Boeing.ADADThe reason\u00a0for the defense sector\u2019s\u00a0underperformance appears multi-fold. For one, defense contractors don\u2019t really fit with the technology-focused bent of the recent upswing in stocks and because their business didn\u2019t crash and burn as much as many others did, there\u2019s less room for that mythical, V-shaped recovery many still\u00a0hope will occur.\u00a0 Second, as Congress  debates injecting at least $1 trillion more in\u00a0stimulus funds into the pandemic-stricken economy, the deficit is set to explode and the government will likely have to make up some of that spending elsewhere. The worry is that the U.S.\u2019s gargantuan defense budget will be a prime target, particularly if former Vice President Joe Biden succeeds in unseating President Donald Trump in this year\u2019s presidential election.Any hit to defense spending isn\u2019t likely to be as bad as what\u2019s suggested by\u00a0current valuations, though. While the deficit may put a cap on defense spending growth, the volatile geopolitical situation likely creates a floor. Historically, there\u2019s a weak correlation between deficit-related economic variables \u2014\u00a0whether that\u2019s business cycles or changes in tax policy \u2014\u00a0and defense spending, Melius Research analyst Carter Copeland noted on a call earlier this month. Material shifts in budgets tend to be more a reflection of changes in national-security posture, he said, such as President Barack Obama\u2019s withdrawal from Iraq\u00a0or President Ronald Reagan\u2019s more aggressive stance toward Russia during the early part of his administration. And there\u2019s not much room for that kind of rethink right now, regardless of who gets elected.\u00a0Tensions are still running hot with the likes of Iran and\u00a0North Korea, while\u00a0Russia and China have taken increasingly aggressive postures. Copeland pointed to a Gallup poll published in March that found half of Americans view the current level of defense spending as\u00a0\u201cabout right,\u201d the highest percentage in more than 50 years.\u00a0Asked on Lockheed\u2019s earnings call Tuesday if the defense budget would decline, new CEO Jim Taiclet declined to \u201cspeculate on the behavior of people that are going to make independent decisions that we can\u2019t predict,\u201d but said the company\u2019s divisions are planning for a wide range of scenarios to be prepared for any outcome. He made a point of citing\u00a0a downturn as a potential opportunity for Lockheed to take advantage of\u00a0depressed asset prices through strategic M&A.\u00a0ADADAt the end of the day, \u201csentiment is fickle, while fundamentals are facts,\u201d\u00a0Vertical Research Partners analyst Rob Stallard wrote in a report last month. \u201cWhile we think defense companies can\u2019t do much about the slowing Department of Defense budget outlook, they are still growing and\u00a0have good visibility, good cash flow and good valuations.\u201d What more do you want?\u00a0This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Brooke Sutherland is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering deals and industrial companies.

According to Ad Analytics, which tracks TV buys, no other commercials by Republican candidates for House or Senate have bothered with Biden, focusing more frequently on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) or Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York.ADFour months after Super Tuesday, four months before the general election, Biden has not become the focus of Republican or conservative attacks at the level of recent Democratic nominees. That\u2019s not for a lack of trying by President Trump\u2019s campaign, which has spent tens of millions of dollars attacking Biden.

In the run-up to Iowa\u2019s caucuses, former Iowa first lady Christie Vilsack urged voters to \u201cthink about the people in the middle\u201d and pick Biden to appeal to them, even if they were more in agreement with another candidate.ADThat argument didn\u2019t sell in Iowa or New Hampshire, but it clicked in South Carolina and quickly got Biden the nomination. The months since then have been a study in Republican frustration, with Biden\u2019s personal favorable rating holding steady in the high 40s and no particular personal attack on Biden breaking through with focus groups.\u201cYou can try to paint him as a radical, but it\u2019s not going to work,\u201d Vilsack\u2019s husband, former agriculture secretary Tom Vilsack, said in an interview. \u201cThere may be a lot of reasons, both in terms of race and in terms of gender, that made Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton susceptible to that kind of stuff. Joe Biden is a white guy.\u201dADThat\u2019s one theory for why Biden, despite two previous runs for president, has simply not churned up much voter anger. No recent Democratic nominee has entered the summer of a presidential election without a clear effort to portray them as dangerous. By this point in 2016, the conservative publisher Regnery was selling eight books about Hillary Clinton; by this point in 2012, it was selling 13 books about Barack Obama.ADThe publisher is offering just one book about this year\u2019s nominee, the upcoming \u201cThe Biden Deception,\u201d\u00a0which asks whether Biden is a \u201ccrypto-socialist.\u201d That\u2019s it, and no other books critical of Biden, specifically, are being published right now. Dinesh D\u2019Souza, who produced election-year books and documentaries about both Obama and Clinton, is now selling \u201cThe United States of Socialism,\u201d in which Biden appears only a few times as a \u201csocialist lite,\u201d with more attention paid to the business dealings of Biden\u2019s son Hunter and brother Jimmy than to Biden\u2019s own record. Peter Schweizer, whose \u201cClinton Cash\u201d and related 2016 articles provided ammo for the Trump campaign, dealt briefly with Biden in a book about \u201cAmerica's progressive elite.\u201d\u00a0David Freddoso, a conservative journalist who published\u00a0\u201cThe Case Against Barack Obama\u201d\u00a0for Regnery in August 2008, watched it hit the New York Times bestseller list, then published two more takedowns of the 44th president. He doubted that there would be as much interest in a similar Biden book.AD\u201cThere was a real hunger for knowledge about Obama in 2008,\u201d Freddoso said. \u201cHe was intriguing and unknown. People perceived him as something different, and as someone with a future. Biden can't pretend to be any of those things. He's also running against an incumbent who is everyone's center of attention. If your goal is to generate interest and sell books, you're probably better off this time writing about Trump.\u201dADThere has been digging into Biden\u2019s record, but none of it has stirred conservative passions. The Republican National Committee briefly campaigned for the release of Biden\u2019s Senate papers, which are being held by the University of Delaware until after his career in \u201cpublic life\u201d is over. But it has not mentioned that issue since May 12, a night-and-day difference with the demands Clinton faced for her emails or that Obama faced for his birth and college records.\u00a0The conservative group Judicial Watch has sued for those papers and sued for Hunter Biden\u2019s business records, but neither effort has gotten much attention. In a recent, seven-minute segment with Judicial Watch\u2019s Tom Fitton, Fox Business host Lou Dobbs repeatedly pivoted to other stories, asking Fitton about the Supreme Court\u2019s electoral college ruling and the president\u2019s July 3 speech at Mount Rushmore.AD\u201cI want to take up the Biden issue, and I\u2019m talking about the Hunter Biden issue, with 10 percent ownership in that private equity, Chinese, private equity firm,\u201d Dobbs said. \u201cBut I want to get a sense, from you, as to the president taking on, for the first time, corporate America and its role in this left-wing fascism that is being bred in this country.\u201dADRepublican attacks on Biden have adjusted to the candidate's outrage-deficient image. In its own advertising, the Trump campaign portrays Biden as \u201cweak\u201d and \u201cdeclining,\u201d arguing that he would not truly be running the country if he won the election. In a Fourth of July tweet, sometime Trump adviser Newt Gingrich wrote that he was not \u201cafraid of Joe Biden\u201d but afraid of the Democrats his win would empower.\u00a0\u201cPrecisely because Biden is weak he would be dominated by Pelosi and Schumer,\u201d Gingrich wrote. In a column three days later, former New Hampshire senator Judd Gregg went further, arguing without evidence that \u201cthe socialist/progressive wing of the Democratic Party\u201d would engineer a \u201ccoup\u201d if Biden won, installing a new left-wing president that the country had never gotten to vet.AD\u201cWithin a few months of assuming the presidency, Biden may find himself being the next statue toppled as the socialist/progressive movement moves closer to power,\u201d Gregg wrote. \u201cReplacing him with his vice president could be deemed necessary to the cause.\u201dADAt the start of the year, Republicans hoped to be running against of those other Democrats. Ahead of the South Carolina primary, as Biden reeled, Republicans prepared to mourn him: a Democrat they could do business with, defeated by his party's radical left.\u201cI\u2019d say he\u2019s probably the most likely one to have a chance at beating Donald Trump,\u201d former House speaker Paul D. Ryan told CNBC in February. \u201cBut I don\u2019t see Joe getting the nomination, I just don\u2019t see him getting there. I think it\u2019s going be one of these progressives, which I think will be much easier to beat.\u201dADFive months later, the Democratic nominee has given Republicans little to work with, and even his critics inside the party are delighted. At his June 30 news conference in Wilmington, Biden distanced himself from protesters who've torn down, or called for the removal, of statues celebrating America's founders. In lieu of a gaffe, Republicans accused him of being too meek to condemn those protesters.AD\u201cDems support the riots. The vandals. The anarchists,\u201d Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas tweeted. \u201cThat\u2019s their base. And they\u2019re terrified to offend them.\u201dThat inspired a response from Ocasio-Cortez, who had endorsed Bernie Sanders for president, and once said that in another country, she and Biden would belong to different political parties.AD\u201cYes, that is precisely why the party nominated...

Wootson Jr.A guide to racial politics in an older conservative stronghold.In the statesThe Democratic presidential primary is not over. Yes, Joe Biden has secured enough delegates to win the nomination on the first ballot. Yes, his Democratic rivals have endorsed him. But three states and Puerto Rico, all of which had delayed their primaries due to the coronavirus pandemic, are finally picking delegates this week. And former Bernie Sanders campaign staffers are still encouraging supporters to back him and increase his clout at the DNC.Two of those states vote today, Delaware and New Jersey. (Louisiana votes this weekend.) In the former vice president's adopted home state, he's favored to win all 21 delegates, thanks both to his local strength and to the state's demographics.\u00a0Black voters regularly make up a third of the Democratic electorate in Delaware, and the state's biggest population center, New Castle County, contains the kind of suburbs that rallied behind Biden when the primary was still competitive. Combine that with Sanders's weakness in the Maryland counties that border rural Delaware, and Elizabeth Warren's presence on the ballot, and it may be a stretch for Sanders to hit the 15 percent of the vote needed to secure a delegate. The most interesting aspect of the election may be that Delaware used it to experiment with online, secured voting, though it halted that after concerns were raised by voters.There are 126 delegates at stake in New Jersey, the biggest prize still left on the calendar; like Delaware, it wasn't friendly territory for Sanders four years ago. (He won 37 percent of the vote there, compared with 39 percent in the First State.) Like Texas, New Jersey assigns some of its delegates statewide and the rest to winners in state legislative districts. Sanders won just one of those districts, in red and rural northwest New Jersey, four years ago, and he ran strongly around college campuses. Unlike Delawareans, New Jersey voters will have just two candidates on their ballots, but they'll have an \u201cuncommitted\u201d option, too, and the choice of a no-name protest vote has probably cost Sanders delegates in other states, such as Kentucky.Delaware won't hold the rest of its statewide elections until September, but New Jersey's congressional primaries will end tomorrow, and four of them are worth watching. The bitterest race is in the 2nd District, which Rep. Jeff Van Drew won as a Democrat two years ago, only to switch parties when polling found his vote against impeachment potentially costing him the seat in a primary. (Van Drew has since flipped on a multitude of issues, co-sponsoring statehood for D.C. before voting against it.) He faces an intraparty challenge from Bob Patterson, who ran in a different seat on the other side of the state four years ago and has spent only around $200,000 on this race.Five Democrats are fighting for the right to face Van Drew. The strongest fundraiser has been Amy Kennedy, the wife of former Rhode Island congressman Patrick Kennedy, making her first run for office. Local Democratic support had gone to Brigid Callahan Harrison, a Montclair State University political scientist; Kennedy has tried to jujitsu that against Harrison, portraying herself as an anti-machine candidate, even though her husband had tried to win south Jersey Democratic boss George Norcross over to her campaign. Will Cunningham, a former Hill staffer who ran unsuccessfully in the 2018 primary, has struggled to break through, with liberal groups such as the Working Families Party sticking with Kennedy, seeking to avoid the 2018 vote split that helped Van Drew win in the first place. Two other Democrats are on the ballot but have done little campaigning.Democrats flipped three other New Jersey House seats two years ago, all of them heading for very different November races. In the 3rd District, either venture capitalist David Richter or county politician Kate Gibbs will win the right to face Rep. Andy Kim. In the 7th District, state Sen. Tom Kean, the son of the state's most popular living Republican governor, is already one of the party's strongest recruits; he's expected to beat two gadfly candidates and face Rep. Tom Malinowski. (There are no primaries in the 11th District, where Rep. Mikie Sherrill already knows her GOP opponent, former Hill aide Rosemary Becchi.)The rest of Tuesday's contrast are Democratic family feuds, with left-wing candidates working to best incumbents who've outspent them and, in the past, rolled past opposition easily. In the 5th District, which moderate Rep. Josh Gottheimer is the first Democrat to represent, city councilor Arati Kreibich has run from the left, arguing that constituents can do better than a congressman who frequently votes against party leadership and with Republicans. But since getting organized after the 2016 election, insurgent Democrats have struggled to beat incumbents in swing seats; the 5th District has been moving toward the party but was carried by the president four years ago by a single point.The 8th District is one of the safest Democratic seats in New Jersey and a test for whether the kind of campaign that elected Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in New York can win across the river. Hector Oseguera is the first serious challenger to Rep. Albio Sires, who won the seat 14 years ago and has made few waves in Congress. Oseguera won an early victory when he secured the \u201cA\u201d line on the ballot, the first one voters see in the booth; the district's Democratic leaders countered that by making sure Joe Biden led the \u201cB\u201d line, the one Sires would appear under. While Oseguera has spent just $42,183 on the race, Sires, who does not face credible Republican challengers, spent and raised less than $400,000, a pittance in a safe seat. (New York Rep. Eliot Engel spent nearly $1.4 million on his primary against challenger Jamaal Bowman, which has yet to be called.)Ad watchBrigid Callahan Harrison, \u201cCory Booker.\u201d The Democrat who has locked up the most institutional support in today's key House primary has made the most of it, here using the state's best-known (and widely liked) Democratic figure to encourage voters to turn in ballots. \u201cThere's a reason firefighters, grocery store workers, and laborers support Brigid Harrison,\u201d Booker says; a reflection of coronavirus-era politics, with grocery workers mentioned in the same breath as jobs more commonly mentioned in ads.Amy Kennedy, \u201cMatters.\u201d The well-funded quasi-outsider's closing ad looks like the sort that Democrats have been running everywhere, from a loose focus on \u201caffordable\u201d health care to rebuilding after the pandemic. The twist comes at the end, when there's a quick shot of John, Bobby and Ted Kennedy standing together. \u201cI'll continue the Kennedy legacy of putting people first,\u201d Kennedy says.Jeff Van Drew, \u201cValues.\u201d The onetime conservative Democrat has abandoned all trappings of the party he got elected with, and his closing pre-primary ad could be run by any Republican, anywhere: a pledge to help the president build the wall, more footage of President Trump talking than of the candidate talking, and even a quick hit on the \u201cradicals\u201d in Congress, personified as Ilhan Omar, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Nancy Pelosi.NRSC, \u201cOptions.\u201d Steve Bullock's presidential campaign established him as a centrist Democrat who opposed the party's left flank on issues such as health care. Here, the GOP's campaign committee tries to undo that work, arguing that by giving Democrats control of the Senate, Bullock would grease the skids for Medicare-for-all, a policy he has never supported. \u201cSteve Bullock in the Senate could put Democrats in charge to create a $32 trillion government health-care system that would raise taxes, limit your choice and access to health care,\u201d a narrator warns.\u00a0 \n  \n  \n  You are reading The Trailer, the newsletter that brings the campaign trail to your inbox.  \n   \n   \n    \n   \n   \n  \n \nPoll watchPresident Trump approval rating (Gallup, 1,016 registered voters)Republicans: 91%Independents: 33%Democrats: 2%Gallup no longer does trial heat polling, giving up on it after its final pre-election poll in 2012 found Mitt Romney slightly ahead of Barack Obama. But it does a monthly check of the president's approval rating, and after finding a rise in the start of the year, it has found voters drifting away since the start of the coronavirus pandemic. The headlines focused on Trump's 38 percent approval rating \u2014 well below the number incumbent presidents have been elected with \u2014 but it's the withering of swing-vote support that tells the story. Just one demographic group, white voters without college degrees, supports the president with a clear majority. Meanwhile, while 48 percent of white voters with degrees backed Trump four years ago, per exit polling, just 33 percent of them approve of his performance now.Candidate trackerJoe Biden's do-no-harm campaigning continued through and past the holiday weekend, with no public events, some fundraising and the aforementioned video celebrating the Fourth of July. On Thursday, he'll head to Pennsylvania's Lackawanna County, the place where he was born and where Republicans have made gains recently, to deliver a speech on an economic plan that was delayed by the George Floyd protests.President Trump, meanwhile, announced his first rally since the underwhelming turnout in Tulsa: an outdoor event in Portsmouth, N.H., a swing-state seacoast town with easy access to another swing state, Maine.While the president's Twitter feed has reeled between issues, frequently related to protests and historic statues, the president's team has suggested more executive actions in the coming weeks, which could be used to refocus his campaign.\u201cThis president will do more in the next four weeks than Joe Biden and his team did in the last 40 years,\u201d White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows said in a Monday morning interview on Fox News. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be looking at how we make sure China is addressed, how we bring manufacturing back from overseas to make sure the American worker is supported. We\u2019re also going to look at a number of issues as it relates to\u00a0immigration. We\u2019re going to look at a number of issues as it relates to prescription drug prices and we\u2019re going to get them done when Congress couldn\u2019t get them done.\u201d\u00a0Veep watchSen. Tammy Duckworth of Illinois has only recently been mentioned as a top vice presidential option for Joe Biden; over 36 hours, she became the most talked-about candidate. On Sunday, Duckworth appeared on CNN's \u201cState of the Union\u201d to discuss the president's Mount Rushmore speech and fell into some of the culture war traps that Biden had avoided.\u201cHe spent all his time talking about dead traitors,\u201d Duckworth said. \u201cRemember that the president at Mount Rushmore was standing on ground that was stolen from Native Americans who had actually been given that land during a treaty.\u201d When asked by CNN's Dana Bash whether statues of George Washington should be taken down, Duckworth said \u201cwe should listen to everybody\u201d and \u201clisten to the argument there.\u201dThat led to a full day of rebukes, capped with a Fox News monologue by Tucker Carlson that accused the \u201cunimpressive\u201d senator of not loving America. Duckworth, who lost her legs in an attack on her helicopter during the Iraq War, challenged Carlson to \u201cwalk a mile\u201d in her prosthetics.In Atlanta, Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms tested positive for the coronavirus \u2014 the first person mentioned as a possible Biden running mate to do so \u2014 while the Atlanta Journal-Constitution criticized her recent response to protests.\u201cAtlanta no longer has the luxury of using a hands-off approach that\u2019s allowed some criminals to slyly ply their violent trade amidst peaceful protests,\u201d the newspaper wrote in an editorial. \u201cMayor Bottoms, we need you to assertively step up and lead.\u201dOn Thursday, Sen.

According to Ad Analytics, which tracks TV buys, no other commercials by Republican candidates for House or Senate have bothered with Biden, focusing more frequently on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) or Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York.ADFour months after Super Tuesday, four months before the general election, Biden has not become the focus of Republican or conservative attacks at the level of recent Democratic nominees. That\u2019s not for a lack of trying by President Trump\u2019s campaign, which has spent tens of millions of dollars attacking Biden. But the early summer period that\u2019s typically used to define a presidential challenger has left Biden largely undamaged, with Democrats down the ballot happily associating themselves with him.\u201cHillary Clinton had 30 years of hard negatives against her, and Nancy Pelosi was a leader on liberal issues like Obamacare,\u201d said Matt Gorman, a Republican strategist whose stints at the National Republican Congressional Committee produced countless attacks on Pelosi. \u201cThey were in the spotlight in a way that a vice president operating in Barack Obama\u2019s shadow just wasn\u2019t. And Biden has been adept at not always taking the bait on stuff like \u2018defund the police\u2019 or the Green New Deal. He just doesn\u2019t come off as polarizing.\u201dADBiden\u2019s image, and the troubles that Republicans might have in muddying it, was one of the major arguments for his candidacy. That didn\u2019t always inspire Democratic primary voters. In the run-up to Iowa\u2019s caucuses, former Iowa first lady Christie Vilsack urged voters to \u201cthink about the people in the middle\u201d and pick Biden to appeal to them, even if they were more in agreement with another candidate.ADThat argument didn\u2019t sell in Iowa or New Hampshire, but it clicked in South Carolina and quickly got Biden the nomination.

I think it\u2019s going be one of these progressives, which I think will be much easier to beat.\u201dADFive months later, the Democratic nominee has given Republicans little to work with, and even his critics inside the party are delighted. At his June 30 news conference in Wilmington, Biden distanced himself from protesters who've torn down, or called for the removal, of statues celebrating America's founders. In lieu of a gaffe, Republicans accused him of being too meek to condemn those protesters.AD\u201cDems support the riots. The vandals. The anarchists,\u201d Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas tweeted. \u201cThat\u2019s their base. And they\u2019re terrified to offend them.\u201dThat inspired a response from Ocasio-Cortez, who had endorsed Bernie Sanders for president, and once said that in another country, she and Biden would belong to different political parties.AD\u201cYes, that is precisely why the party nominated...

Wootson Jr.A guide to racial politics in an older conservative stronghold.In the statesThe Democratic presidential primary is not over. Yes, Joe Biden has secured enough delegates to win the nomination on the first ballot. Yes, his Democratic rivals have endorsed him. But three states and Puerto Rico, all of which had delayed their primaries due to the coronavirus pandemic, are finally picking delegates this week. And former Bernie Sanders campaign staffers are still encouraging supporters to back him and increase his clout at the DNC.Two of those states vote today, Delaware and New Jersey. (Louisiana votes this weekend.) In the former vice president's adopted home state, he's favored to win all 21 delegates, thanks both to his local strength and to the state's demographics.\u00a0Black voters regularly make up a third of the Democratic electorate in Delaware, and the state's biggest population center, New Castle County, contains the kind of suburbs that rallied behind Biden when the primary was still competitive. Combine that with Sanders's weakness in the Maryland counties that border rural Delaware, and Elizabeth Warren's presence on the ballot, and it may be a stretch for Sanders to hit the 15 percent of the vote needed to secure a delegate. The most interesting aspect of the election may be that Delaware used it to experiment with online, secured voting, though it halted that after concerns were raised by voters.There are 126 delegates at stake in New Jersey, the biggest prize still left on the calendar; like Delaware, it wasn't friendly territory for Sanders four years ago. (He won 37 percent of the vote there, compared with 39 percent in the First State.) Like Texas, New Jersey assigns some of its delegates statewide and the rest to winners in state legislative districts. Sanders won just one of those districts, in red and rural northwest New Jersey, four years ago, and he ran strongly around college campuses. Unlike Delawareans, New Jersey voters will have just two candidates on their ballots, but they'll have an \u201cuncommitted\u201d option, too, and the choice of a no-name protest vote has probably cost Sanders delegates in other states, such as Kentucky.Delaware won't hold the rest of its statewide elections until September, but New Jersey's congressional primaries will end tomorrow, and four of them are worth watching. The bitterest race is in the 2nd District, which Rep. Jeff Van Drew won as a Democrat two years ago, only to switch parties when polling found his vote against impeachment potentially costing him the seat in a primary. (Van Drew has since flipped on a multitude of issues, co-sponsoring statehood for D.C. before voting against it.) He faces an intraparty challenge from Bob Patterson, who ran in a different seat on the other side of the state four years ago and has spent only around $200,000 on this race.Five Democrats are fighting for the right to face Van Drew. The strongest fundraiser has been Amy Kennedy, the wife of former Rhode Island congressman Patrick Kennedy, making her first run for office. Local Democratic support had gone to Brigid Callahan Harrison, a Montclair State University political scientist; Kennedy has tried to jujitsu that against Harrison, portraying herself as an anti-machine candidate, even though her husband had tried to win south Jersey Democratic boss George Norcross over to her campaign. Will Cunningham, a former Hill staffer who ran unsuccessfully in the 2018 primary, has struggled to break through, with liberal groups such as the Working Families Party sticking with Kennedy, seeking to avoid the 2018 vote split that helped Van Drew win in the first place. Two other Democrats are on the ballot but have done little campaigning.Democrats flipped three other New Jersey House seats two years ago, all of them heading for very different November races. In the 3rd District, either venture capitalist David Richter or county politician Kate Gibbs will win the right to face Rep. Andy Kim. In the 7th District, state Sen. Tom Kean, the son of the state's most popular living Republican governor, is already one of the party's strongest recruits; he's expected to beat two gadfly candidates and face Rep. Tom Malinowski. (There are no primaries in the 11th District, where Rep. Mikie Sherrill already knows her GOP opponent, former Hill aide Rosemary Becchi.)The rest of Tuesday's contrast are Democratic family feuds, with left-wing candidates working to best incumbents who've outspent them and, in the past, rolled past opposition easily. In the 5th District, which moderate Rep. Josh Gottheimer is the first Democrat to represent, city councilor Arati Kreibich has run from the left, arguing that constituents can do better than a congressman who frequently votes against party leadership and with Republicans. But since getting organized after the 2016 election, insurgent Democrats have struggled to beat incumbents in swing seats; the 5th District has been moving toward the party but was carried by the president four years ago by a single point.The 8th District is one of the safest Democratic seats in New Jersey and a test for whether the kind of campaign that elected Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in New York can win across the river. Hector Oseguera is the first serious challenger to Rep. Albio Sires, who won the seat 14 years ago and has made few waves in Congress. Oseguera won an early victory when he secured the \u201cA\u201d line on the ballot, the first one voters see in the booth; the district's Democratic leaders countered that by making sure Joe Biden led the \u201cB\u201d line, the one Sires would appear under. While Oseguera has spent just $42,183 on the race, Sires, who does not face credible Republican challengers, spent and raised less than $400,000, a pittance in a safe seat. (New York Rep. Eliot Engel spent nearly $1.4 million on his primary against challenger Jamaal Bowman, which has yet to be called.)Ad watchBrigid Callahan Harrison, \u201cCory Booker.\u201d The Democrat who has locked up the most institutional support in today's key House primary has made the most of it, here using the state's best-known (and widely liked) Democratic figure to encourage voters to turn in ballots. \u201cThere's a reason firefighters, grocery store workers, and laborers support Brigid Harrison,\u201d Booker says; a reflection of coronavirus-era politics, with grocery workers mentioned in the same breath as jobs more commonly mentioned in ads.Amy Kennedy, \u201cMatters.\u201d The well-funded quasi-outsider's closing ad looks like the sort that Democrats have been running everywhere, from a loose focus on \u201caffordable\u201d health care to rebuilding after the pandemic. The twist comes at the end, when there's a quick shot of John, Bobby and Ted Kennedy standing together. \u201cI'll continue the Kennedy legacy of putting people first,\u201d Kennedy says.Jeff Van Drew, \u201cValues.\u201d The onetime conservative Democrat has abandoned all trappings of the party he got elected with, and his closing pre-primary ad could be run by any Republican, anywhere: a pledge to help the president build the wall, more footage of President Trump talking than of the candidate talking, and even a quick hit on the \u201cradicals\u201d in Congress, personified as Ilhan Omar, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Nancy Pelosi.NRSC, \u201cOptions.\u201d Steve Bullock's presidential campaign established him as a centrist Democrat who opposed the party's left flank on issues such as health care.

But it does a monthly check of the president's approval rating, and after finding a rise in the start of the year, it has found voters drifting away since the start of the coronavirus pandemic. The headlines focused on Trump's 38 percent approval rating \u2014 well below the number incumbent presidents have been elected with \u2014 but it's the withering of swing-vote support that tells the story. Just one demographic group, white voters without college degrees, supports the president with a clear majority. Meanwhile, while 48 percent of white voters with degrees backed Trump four years ago, per exit polling, just 33 percent of them approve of his performance now.Candidate trackerJoe Biden's do-no-harm campaigning continued through and past the holiday weekend, with no public events, some fundraising and the aforementioned video celebrating the Fourth of July. On Thursday, he'll head to Pennsylvania's Lackawanna County, the place where he was born and where Republicans have made gains recently, to deliver a speech on an economic plan that was delayed by the George Floyd protests.President Trump, meanwhile, announced his first rally since the underwhelming turnout in Tulsa: an outdoor event in Portsmouth, N.H., a swing-state seacoast town with easy access to another swing state, Maine.While the president's Twitter feed has reeled between issues, frequently related to protests and historic statues, the president's team has suggested more executive actions in the coming weeks, which could be used to refocus his campaign.\u201cThis president will do more in the next four weeks than Joe Biden and his team did in the last 40 years,\u201d White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows said in a Monday morning interview on Fox News. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be looking at how we make sure China is addressed, how we bring manufacturing back from overseas to make sure the American worker is supported. We\u2019re also going to look at a number of issues as it relates to\u00a0immigration. We\u2019re going to look at a number of issues as it relates to prescription drug prices and we\u2019re going to get them done when Congress couldn\u2019t get them done.\u201d\u00a0Veep watchSen. Tammy Duckworth of Illinois has only recently been mentioned as a top vice presidential option for Joe Biden; over 36 hours, she became the most talked-about candidate. On Sunday, Duckworth appeared on CNN's \u201cState of the Union\u201d to discuss the president's Mount Rushmore speech and fell into some of the culture war traps that Biden had avoided.\u201cHe spent all his time talking about dead traitors,\u201d Duckworth said. \u201cRemember that the president at Mount Rushmore was standing on ground that was stolen from Native Americans who had actually been given that land during a treaty.\u201d When asked by CNN's Dana Bash whether statues of George Washington should be taken down, Duckworth said \u201cwe should listen to everybody\u201d and \u201clisten to the argument there.\u201dThat led to a full day of rebukes, capped with a Fox News monologue by Tucker Carlson that accused the \u201cunimpressive\u201d senator of not loving America. Duckworth, who lost her legs in an attack on her helicopter during the Iraq War, challenged Carlson to \u201cwalk a mile\u201d in her prosthetics.In Atlanta, Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms tested positive for the coronavirus \u2014 the first person mentioned as a possible Biden running mate to do so \u2014 while the Atlanta Journal-Constitution criticized her recent response to protests.\u201cAtlanta no longer has the luxury of using a hands-off approach that\u2019s allowed some criminals to slyly ply their violent trade amidst peaceful protests,\u201d the newspaper wrote in an editorial. \u201cMayor Bottoms, we need you to assertively step up and lead.\u201dOn Thursday, Sen.

The need to maintain relationships with mainland clients has influenced coverage in the past, but many fear the new law will exacerbate this trend.It\u2019s a bit\u00a0late to be worrying about that, though. Self-censorship isn\u2019t just a matter of avoiding gratuitous digs and glib phrases.\u00a0If you look at the ratings given by equity analysts in recent years, it seems to include portraying companies with strong mainland connections as better investments than they actually are.ADADTake the 50 companies on the Hang Seng Index. You can easily break them into three groups: 15 Chinese state-owned enterprises, or SOEs, such as Bank of China Ltd. and PetroChina Ltd.; 13 civilian-controlled mainland Chinese businesses, or COEs, such as Tencent Ltd. and Sino Biopharmaceutical Ltd.; and 22\u00a0other, mostly locally controlled stocks, such as HSBC Holdings Plc, CK Hutchison Holdings Ltd. and AIA Group Ltd(1).\u00a0Then look at the extent to which analysts\u2019 consensus target prices have exceeded\u00a0actual stock prices in recent years. SOEs get the most favorable treatment, with target prices exceeding actual prices by an average\u00a0of 24% since the start of 2016, compared to 16% for the COEs and 13% for non-mainland companies.It\u2019s not just in Hong Kong that brokers\u2019 target prices tend to run higher than the actual market \u2014\u00a0there\u2019s a reason they\u2019re called sell-side analysts.\u00a0China is still an emerging market, too, so it\u2019s not impossible that its stocks simply have more upside than those operating out of a mature economy such as Hong Kong.\u00a0ADADSo perhaps the reason state-owned enterprises get a target price premium over local companies is simply that they\u2019re better investments that will deliver higher returns to investors?If only. Thanks to booming\u00a0tech and biotech stocks and the huge run-up in prices during 2017, civilian-owned Chinese companies did achieve pretty stunning average total returns of 31% over the past four-and-a-half years. SOEs, however, averaged a measly\u00a01.9%, far less than the 6.1% achieved by the non-mainland stocks.It\u2019s not totally irrational that possessing a wealthy patron should be seen as an advantage for some investments. The Chinese state tends to put its thumb heavily on the scales in favor of its own organs, with diminishing benefits the further you get from the commanding heights of the economy,\u00a0as my colleague  Shuli Ren has written.ADADIn particular, it\u2019s logical for credit analysts to give state-owned enterprises a better rating than those that can\u2019t count on the backing of the Chinese government to bail them out. Even there, you\u2019ve not been paying attention if you think the interests of private bondholders are going to be treated equally with those of  better-connected investors.Still, when looking at the equity market, the proof should be in the pudding. If analysts predict a stock will consistently outperform \u2014\u00a0as they tend to do in relation to SOEs \u2014\u00a0then it should do that. If not, they\u2019re either bad at their jobs or\u00a0misleading their clients.There are many things\u00a0to worry about in Hong Kong\u2019s new national security law. The integrity of equity research is probably not one of them. Sell-side brokers themselves gave that away long ago.ADAD(1) We\u2019ve equal-weighted each of these baskets of stocks so that a few stocks with huge market caps like Tencent, HSBC or China Construction Bank don\u2019t skew the overall result.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.David Fickling is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering commodities, as well as industrial and consumer companies.

Subscribe today.arrow-right1. What\u2019s state aid?It\u2019s when governments hand out support to key manufacturers or industries, which typically takes the form of cheap loans, tax breaks, contracts or direct subsidies. The idea is to give homegrown corporations an edge over outside competitors to create jobs, drive exports and fuel economic growth. Sometimes the state acquires partial ownership. Though aid can be modest, it attracts attention when it lasts for decades or drives the deliberate creation of dominant firms celebrated as \u201cnational champions.\u201dADAD2. What\u2019s wrong with a little help?It\u2019s a question of fairness, and about who gets to pick winners. There\u2019s also concern that governments may be supporting unviable \u201czombie\u201d companies, choking innovation and wasting money. Before the pandemic, Italy\u2019s repeated bank rescues raised hackles, while the U.S. and Europe have feuded for decades over support for rival planemakers Boeing Co. and Airbus SE. Under President Donald Trump, the U.S. sparked a trade war partly over accusations that China\u2019s subsidies created unfair competition for American firms. State support can fuel battles between places vying for jobs and investment; Ireland and Luxembourg became targets of European Union regulators for the low tax rates they charged Apple Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. respectively.3. Is state aid on the rise?ADADThe pandemic may be sweeping aside any pretense of restraint. For years, European leaders struggling with rising populism and competition from big Chinese firms wanted more leeway to act. Then the virus crisis drove governments and central banks to unleash waves of state assistance. While much of it preserved jobs and businesses economy-wide, other efforts were more targeted. The EU quickly relaxed curbs on cash injections and other support. Airlines around the world were rescued with offers of multi-billion dollar loans and job support packages. France provided funds to carmaker Renault SA and the aerospace industry, while Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV secured a loan to support its operations in Italy. The U.K. and Canada also pledged to step in. Germany put aside frugal traditions and unleashed a strategy to help key industries and promote local suppliers. Its $10 billion bailout of Deutsche Lufthansa AG will result in the government owning a 20% stake.4. Who\u2019s complaining?One regular voice of outrage is the chief executive officer of budget airline Ryanair Holdings Plc, Michael O\u2019Leary, who says state assistance for his rivals amounts to governments \u201cselectively gifting billions of euros to their inefficient flag carriers.\u201d Deep-pocketed Germany is showering firms with aid that debt-ridden Italy can\u2019t match, prompting calls for more fairness. To ensure weakened companies don\u2019t become easy prey, the EU is rewriting competition rules to restrict takeovers by foreign entities that may be receiving state aid. China\u2019s HNA Group Co., which shot to prominence by spending more than $40 billion on acquisitions across six continents starting in 2016, has become one of the biggest corporate casualties of the pandemic. China began assuming control of the debt-laden firm in March.ADAD5. Who keeps score?Institutions such as the World Trade Organization try to keep the peace by adjudicating state-aid spats. But there\u2019s plenty of scope for discord. Member states created a system for handling subsidies but left plenty of wiggle room for the nations to provide support. Since the U.S. paralyzed the WTO\u2019s appellate body in 2019, defendants can veto rulings by appealing them into a legal void. Meanwhile the U.S., Japan and the EU have been trying to work together to forge new subsidy rules for China. Policing state aid is also a cornerstone of the EU, which regulates Europe\u2019s vast free trade area known as the common market, home to almost 450 million consumers.6. Does state aid work?ADYes -- or there wouldn\u2019t be fights about it. Helping companies and creating jobs serves a political purpose; whether there\u2019s an economic benefit to aiding coal, steel or autos is harder to say. But there\u2019s a broad perception that having companies that can compete globally has powered exports in the U.S., South Korea, Japan and China. Bailouts of banks and big companies during the 2008 crisis rescued the global financial system and most loans were repaid, though they also created resentment about the use of taxpayer funds.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P.", "comment": "0 Comments", "topic": "Energy"}, {"cover": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/NMOIQ5GBEMI6VCIINCRLT2XJ4A.jpghttps://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/NMOIQ5GBEMI6VCIINCRLT2XJ4A.jpg", "title": "Spreading rock dust on the ground could pull carbon from the air, researchers say", "date": "Jul 8, 2020", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-solutions/2020/07/08/spreading-rock-dust-ground-could-pull-carbon-air-researchers-say/", "keyword": "China and Security", "website": "the Washington Post", "author": "Lyndsey Layton", "content": "Spreading rock dust on farmland could pull enough carbon dioxide from the atmosphere to remove about half of the amount of that greenhouse gas currently produced by Europe, according to a major study published Thursday in the journal Nature.Support our journalism.

When silicate or carbonate minerals in the dust dissolve in rain water, carbon dioxide is drawn from the atmosphere into the solution to form bicarbonate ions. The bicarbonate ions are eventually washed by runoff into the ocean, where they form carbonate minerals, storing their carbon indefinitely.ADADThe study published Thursday is the first analysis that used modeling and simulations to estimate the potential of individual countries to capture carbon through enhanced rock weathering.As nations around the globe strive to mitigate climate change, it\u2019s not enough to reduce the carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases produced when humans burn fossil fuels, experts say.Carbon already in the atmosphere has to be removed, scientists say, if nations are to prevent the average global surface temperature from crossing a perilous threshold: 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit) above preindustrial levels. That is the point beyond which experts warn about dangerous and irreversible changes to the planet. The 2015 Paris accord, supported by every major economy except the United States under President Trump, calls for severe cuts in greenhouse gas emissions, as well as the removal of between 2 billion and 10 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide each year to reach net-zero emissions by 2050.ADAD\u201cSpreading rock dust on agricultural land is a straightforward, practical CO2 drawdown approach with the potential to boost soil health and food production,\u201d said David Beerling, director of the Leverhulme Centre for Climate Change Mitigation and lead author of the study. \u201cOur analyses reveal the big emitting nations \u2014 China, the U.S., India \u2014 have the greatest potential to do this, emphasizing their need to step up to the challenge.\u201dThe researchers point out that the countries where enhanced rock weatherization has the greatest potential also have much to lose as the planet warms. \u201cChina, the United States and India are all vulnerable to climate change and resultant sea-level rise,\u201d the study said. \u201cTheir high risks of economic damage and social disruption provide impetus for creative co-design of agricultural and climate policies.\u201dClimate change is a racial justice problemEuropean countries have less capacity to remove CO2 through enhanced rock weatherization than China, the United States and India because they have less farmland. The European countries with the greatest potential to get rid of carbon dioxide through enhanced rock weatherization are also the largest emitters: Germany, Spain and Poland, the study said.ADADThe researchers say the cost of enhanced rock weatherization is comparable to other proposals to remove carbon dioxide, including sequestration, in which CO2 is captured as it is emitted from a power plant or a factory and is absorbed into a liquid or a solid and stored. But spreading rock dust over farmland carries the added benefit that it could help rebuild deteriorating agricultural soils in many parts of the world, they argue.Still, researchers acknowledged their theoretical analysis requires long term real-world trials. And they raise concerns that demand for rock dust may increase mining or grinding operations, which in turn could consume enough energy to account for 10 to 30 percent of the amount of CO2 captured. Layering dust on agricultural soils also requires careful management to make sure metals and other organic compounds are not added to crop fields, they said.Most Americans want the government to do more to fight climate changeFarmers have long applied limestone to their fields to reduce acidity and provide nutrients in Africa, Brazil and Malaysia. Enhanced rock weathering replaces lime with crushed calcium and magnesium-rich silicate rock.ADADSpreading volcanic rock on farmland not only has the potential to remove carbon dioxide but has several side benefits, the scientists said. The practice does not compete with the use of agricultural land \u2014 in fact, it can enhance the quality of the soil, improving crop yields while reducing the need for artificial fertilizers. Rock left over from mining or construction \u2014 \u201cwaste rock\u201d \u2014 can be processed for this use, creating a reason to recycle it, the researchers said.Indonesia and Brazil, which emit a small fraction of the carbon dioxide produced by the United States and China, would also have great potential to remove CO2 this way because they have a large percentage of farmland and because their tropical climates would speed up the processes involved in weathering, the scientists said.\u201cWe have passed the safe level of greenhouse gases,\u201d said James Hansen, a partner in the study and director of the Climate Science, Awareness and Solutions Program at Columbia University\u2019s Earth Institute. \u201cCutting fossil fuel emissions is crucial, but we must also extract atmospheric CO2 with safe, secure and scalable carbon dioxide removal strategies to bend the global CO2 curve and limit future climate change.\u201d", "comment": "335 Comments", "topic": "Climate Solutions"}, {"cover": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/VB2UEQGBDMI6VCIINCRLT2XJ4A.jpghttps://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/VB2UEQGBDMI6VCIINCRLT2XJ4A.jpg", "title": "The Daily 202: Some U.S. health officials lament a coronavirus crisis that didn\u2019t need to happen", "date": "Jul 8, 2020", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/the-daily-202-some-us-health-officials-lament-a-coronavirus-crisis-that-didnt-need-to-happen/2020/07/08/6c525d62-08af-432b-abe1-10736b5dd1bc_story.html", "keyword": "China and Security", "website": "the Washington Post", "author": "Chelsea Janes", "content": "with Mariana AlfaroNote to readers: James Hohmann is on vacation until July 20.

Subscribe today.arrow-rightIn late May, former World Bank president Jim Yong Kim, an American who has served in Democratic and Republican administrations, waxed incredulous at the lack of a coordinated U.S. strategy\u00a0aimed at combating the novel coronavirus.Kim was making an opening statement during an online roundtable with public health experts from academia, local U.S. health departments and hospital systems about tried-and-true infection containment strategies like testing, contact tracing and isolation, which have been employed effectively in other countries.AD\u00a0\u201cThe thing that\u2019s been driving me crazy is that we\u2019ve just decided that the standard health response \u2014 the only thing that\u2019s worked in any of the countries that suppressed the virus \u2014 is something that we\u2019re just not going to do,\u201d said Kim, who headed the World Health Organization\u2019s HIV response during the second George W. Bush administration and led the World Bank for parts of the Obama and Trump administrations.ADSara Cody, head of the public health department in California's Santa Clara County, known now for orchestrating one of the country\u2019s earliest coronavirus shutdowns, was also on the call. She seemed relieved to hear him say so.\u201cI begin to feel like, am I the one that\u2019s not thinking straight? It feels a little lonely,\u201d Cody said then.ADCody is not alone among U.S. health officials, epidemiologists, virologists and other experts in feeling like she missed the memo saying the world\u2019s richest nation really couldn\u2019t do much to keep this virus from paralyzing it. Many local officials are still asking the same question Kim posed that day: \u201cWhy have we given up on containment?\u201d \u00a0The pressing question is whether political officials have the will to employ reliable measures to curtail the virus.So far, that political will has been largely lacking, from President Trump down to many state and local officials trying to limit the virus's spread without destroying the economy. The country as a whole sets a new high in cases almost every day. The virus is spreading unchecked in states as distant geographically and ideologically as California and Alabama. Arizona has diagnosed more cases per capita than any European country.ADADA new influential model released Tuesday from the University of Washington's Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation predicts 208,255 American deaths by Nov. 1 if no further mitigation efforts are enforced. If mask use becomes widespread, then those projected deaths would drop to 162,807 people.\u201cThe key is we did not have to be here right now,\u201d Leana Wen, a Washington Post contributing columnist and former Baltimore health commissioner and head of Planned Parenthood, told CNN. Wen argued that if the United States employs effective containment measure \u2014 including social distancing and mask wearing \u2014 \u201cthat 200,000 number doesn't have to be inevitable.\u201dAnthony S. Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergies and Infectious Diseases, said Monday that the country is still experiencing the beginning stages of the pandemic.\u201cWe are still knee-deep in the first wave of this, and I would say this would not be considered a wave \u2014 this is a surge and resurgence of infections, superimposed on a baseline that never got down where we wanted to go,\u201d Fauci said.That only hardened the notion of inevitability \u2014 cementing the feeling that the virus would have spread no matter what.\u00a0The Trump administration isn't aggressively messaging around or clamping down on the virus, as the president has violated recommendations from his own health officials to wear a mask in public, not to attend crowded gatherings and to distance from others. Indeed, the Trump administration seems bent on getting Americans to forget about the contagion, even as cases surge in some states.ADAD\u201cWhite House officials also hope Americans will grow numb to the escalating death toll and learn to accept tens of thousands of new cases a day, according to three people familiar with the White House\u2019s thinking, who requested anonymity to reveal internal deliberations. Americans will \u2018live with the virus being a threat,\u2019 in the words of one of those people, a senior administration official,\" according to my colleagues Yasmeen Abutaleb and Josh Dawsey.But\u00a0the virus didn\u2019t have to become so widespread that officials aren't sure they will be able to offer full in-person teaching at American schools in the fall, although Trump is pressuring state and local officials to do so. Just look at other places like Taiwan, South Korea and Hong Kong that have successfully contained the virus.\u00a0The United States, experts say, was not doomed to lose control.\u201cOther countries have taken it seriously, and we have not,\u201d said Ashish Jha, director of the Global Health Institute at Harvard University. \u201cOther [countries] have had a very aggressive shutdown. We have not. Other countries have taken an aggressive approach to testing and tracing and isolation. We have not. Some countries have universal masking laws, and we don\u2019t.\u201dADADKim led the HIV response in Haiti. He oversaw implementation of contact tracing for Ebola in Liberia and Sierra Leone. Still, he said the coronavirus pandemic in the United States is still one of the most difficult public health challenges he has ever encountered, in part because of a convoluted health insurance system and political dysfunction.Certainly, the effort required to contain the virus in the United States sooner would have qualified as Herculean \u2014 adjusted upward for 3,000 years or so of inflation. But there were a host of missed opportunities, from not recognizing the threat early enough, to a botched testing strategy rolled out by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, to a patchwork of erratic orders from states and not the central government.Containment would have required coordinated mobilization of federal and state resources to acquire or manufacture enough personal protective equipment and testing supplies to avoid shortages if at all possible. It would have required outfitting a nation of long understaffed and underfunded health departments. It would have required a cohesive public messaging campaign strong enough to unify to a divided nation behind the common cause of eradicating the virus before hundreds of thousands could die from it.But containment was not impossible here.After the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa, experts from the nonprofit Nuclear Threat Initiative and Johns Hopkins University partnered with the Economist Intelligence Unit and philanthropic groups to develop a Global Health Security Index measuring countries\u2019 readiness to combat dangerous outbreaks based on the answers publicly available data yielded to 140 questions across six categories. In a report published in 2019, the United States ranked as the most prepared country overall.ADAD\u201cOne of the things they didn\u2019t think about was political inaction and political ineptitude,\u201d Jha said of that report, echoing other experts who say the United States has lacked the \u201cpolitical will\u201d to meet the covid-19 moment.Local officials and nationally visible epidemiologists alike say that when federal and state officials downplayed the public health threat posed by the virus, they undermined the sense of urgency necessary to mobilize a country of this size and keep it focused on the problem.As with most public health responses, success is not usually measured in what does happen but what doesn\u2019t. In this case, success would be measured in people not suffering and dying from a virus they needn\u2019t have been exposed to in the first place. Beating the virus, therefore, would feel significant only in hindsight and by comparison, when what could have been is juxtaposed with what was.ADADFighting a pandemic, therefore, requires commitment to consistency and delayed gratification \u2014 something public health experts like Kim and Jha say federal leadership has not modeled for the public. Each day now costs the country more than 500 lives. The country no longer has weeks to prepare testing, tracing and isolation strategies. Our nationwide public health infrastructure cannot fit into a few panicked weeks what it needed to do over months.So far, the cost of American apathy has been 128,566 lives in the United States in four months \u2014 or a fourth of what the country lost to World War II in three and a half years.In the meantime, local officials who haven\u2019t given up on containment are being forced to lead the massive undertaking themselves, knowing that whatever they achieve in their own jurisdictions, they can't control what happens in the next county over. Some have been rewarded with criticism and even death threats from those who believe their efforts cratered the economy or are imposing on individual freedoms.ADADHealth departments from Louisville to Portland, Ore., to Sauk County, Wis., are trying to hire more staff on the fly \u2014 in some cases more than doubling the size of their departments \u2014 so they will also have enough staff to trace cases, assuming they have the testing supplies to identify them in the first place.\u00a0Mayors are begging citizens to wear masks, even as their state governments won\u2019t mandate them. A country\u2019s worth of local officials with tired arms is holding tiny umbrellas they must patch as they go, hoping it will prevent their localities from being inundated with the virus.\u00a0So far, it isn\u2019t really working.\u201cThe current state is really not good,\u201d Fauci said. \u201c \u2026 We went up, never came down to baseline, and now are surging back up. It\u2019s a serious situation we have to address immediately.\u201dMore on the coronavirusFlorida invited the nation to its reopening. Then it became the nation's new coronavirus epicenter.\u00a0\u201cNearly 1 out of every 100 residents is infected with the virus, hospital intensive care units are full or filling up, and big-name visitors who chose Florida for their first post-isolation events are now mired in questions and controversies about safety. Amid escalating infections, Florida, once held up by Trump as a model for how to manage the novel coronavirus, is faring poorly. Residents worry the situation will get much worse,\u201d Cleve R. Wootson Jr., Isaac Stanley-Becker and Lori Rozsa report. \u201cOn Tuesday there were 213,794 cases of the coronavirus in Florida, according to Post data. \u2026 52 intensive care units across more than a third of the state\u2019s counties had reached capacity\u2026\u00a0AD\u201cHospital leaders, lawmakers, physicians, epidemiologists, advocates and others familiar with the state\u2019s response said a false sense of security set in when grim predictions about the virus\u2019s spread in Florida did not come to pass in March and April. \u2026 \u00a0Sports leagues that opted to restart their seasons in Florida will now play in a state that is in worse shape than when the pandemic began. \u2026 The Republican National Convention, scheduled to take place in Jacksonville next month, faces similar questions about safety \u2026 Several hundred doctors have signed a petition that says the convention needs stronger safety measures \u2026 Disney World has announced it would begin to allow visitors back into the Magic Kingdom this week. \u2026\u00a0\u201cThere has been a rise in cases affecting older Floridians as well as those living in nursing homes and other long-term care facilities \u2026 Testing sites across the state are seeing shortages, and the wait time for results is now as long as 10 days \u2026 There were also acute shortages of the antiviral drug remdesivir in parts of the state, causing Democratic members of Florida\u2019s congressional delegation to send a letter Tuesday to HHS Alex Azar asking him to speed the shipment of emergency supplies. \u2026 Amid the array of old and new concerns, teachers across Florida learned they would have to begin preparing their classrooms for an influx of students. \u2026 \u2018I\u2019ve spoken with a lot of my teacher friends, and a lot of them don\u2019t want to go back,\u2019 [first-grade teacher Cara Conlogue said]. \u2018We love our students, we miss them, and we love our jobs. But we don\u2019t feel safe.\u2019\u201dAs the virus spreads and hospitalizations rise, it\u2019s America vs. the world.\u201cTrump pitted America against the world [by] moving to pull the United States out of the WHO while his FBI director accused China of hacking U.S. health-care companies that are researching the novel coronavirus,\u201d Joshua Partlow reports. \u201c\u2018At this very moment, China is working to compromise American health-care organizations, pharmaceutical companies and academic institutions conducting essential covid research,\u2019 [FBI Director Christopher] Wray said in remarks at the Hudson Institute...\u00a0\"His remarks came as cases and hospitalizations in the United States continued to mount \u2026 Arizona reported 117 deaths on Tuesday, a daily record for the state, as more than 3,000 people were being treated in hospitals and ICU beds neared capacity. Texas canceled its annual state fair, the longest-running fair in the country, as more than 8,000 Texans were hospitalized on Monday, a third higher than last week. Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine (R) issued an order Tuesday requiring residents to wear masks in public in seven counties, including those that are home to Cincinnati and Cleveland. \u2026 More than 890 U.S. deaths were reported Tuesday, the highest total in 12 days, amid signs the country\u2019s death rate might be creeping up after falling for the past three months.\u00a0\"Trump has repeatedly complained that not enough attention is being paid to the country\u2019s death rate. ... Scientists say many countries have lower death rates than the United States. \u2026 Anthony S. Fauci, said that although the fatality rate of the coronavirus has dropped, Americans should not be complacent. \u2018It\u2019s a false narrative to take comfort in a lower rate of death,' Fauci [said] \u2026 The lower mortality rate is a result of two factors, he said. The country has gotten better at treating people, particularly through therapies that work in the advanced stages of the disease. And, Fauci said, the mean age of those getting infected has dropped by about 15 years.\u201dTrump\u2019s new visa rules are seen as a way to pressure colleges into reopening.\u201cA directive by the Trump administration that would strip international college students of their U.S. visas if their coursework was entirely online prompted widespread confusion on Tuesday as students scrambled to clarify their statuses and universities reassessed their fall reopening policies amid the coronavirus pandemic,\u201d the Times reports. \u201cThe effect may be to dramatically reduce the number of international students enrolling in the fall. Together with delays in processing visas as a result of the pandemic, immigrant advocates say the new rules, which must still be finalized this month, might discourage many overseas students from attending American universities, where they often pay full tuition. \u2026 Although higher education officials saw the move by the Trump administration as an attempt to force their hands on reopening, which Trump has pushed for, the directive also holds appeal to groups that favor reducing legal immigration to the United States.\u201d\u00a0Southeastern Veterans\u2019 Center, a Pennsylvania nursing home, gave some veterans hydroxychloroquine even without testing them for the coronavirus in what nurses referred to as the \u201ccovid cocktail.\u201d There is no way to know whether the treatment played a role in any deaths at the home, which has attributed 42 fatalities to covid-19.

(NYT)The Trump presidencyTrump\u2019s attacks on mail voting are turning Republicans off absentee ballots.\u00a0The dynamic is alarming \u201cRepublican strategists, who say it could undercut their own candidates, including Trump himself,\u201d Amy Gardner and Josh Dawsey report. \u201cIn several primaries this spring, Democratic voters have embraced mail ballots in far larger numbers than Republicans during a campaign season defined by the pandemic. And when they urge their supporters to vote by mail, GOP campaigns around the country are hearing from more and more Republican voters who say they do not trust absentee ballots, according to multiple strategists. \u2026 The growing Republican antagonism toward voting by mail comes even as the Trump campaign is launching a major absentee-ballot program in every competitive state, according to multiple campaign advisers \u2013 a delicate balancing act \u2026 The president, however, has been arguing the opposite. Nearly daily in recent weeks and usually on Twitter, Trump has attacked mail balloting, leveling many unsubstantiated allegations.\"In a new guidance, the CDC is recommending that voters consider alternatives to casting their ballots in person.\u00a0\u201cThe guidance was issued with little fanfare on June 22 and suggested that state and local election officials take steps to minimize crowds at voting locations, including offering \u2018alternative voting methods,\u2019\u201d Michelle Ye Hee Lee reports. \u201cVoters who want to cast ballots in person should consider showing up at off-peak times, bringing their own black ink pens or touch-screen pens for voting machines, and washing their hands before entering and after leaving the polling location, the guidance said. Workers and voters alike, it said, should wear face coverings.\u201d \u00a0At least five Republican lawmakers are not going to the Jacksonville convention.\u201cSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), 78, indicated Tuesday he will attend the convention, but two other top Senate Republicans, Iowa\u2019s Charles E. Grassley, 86, and Tennessee\u2019s Lamar Alexander, 80, are taking a pass,\u201d Michael Scherer and Josh Dawsey report. \u201cMaine\u2019s Susan Collins, 67, said though a spokesman that she avoids attending the party convention in years when she is facing reelection. Alaska\u2019s Lisa Murkowski, 63, also has no plans to attend, according to a spokesperson, nor does Utah\u2019s Mitt Romney, 73. Collins, Murkowski and Romney have criticized Trump on occasion, making their presence potentially uncomfortable at an event that will largely be a tribute to the president. But Grassley made it clear his decision is motivated solely by fear of contracting the coronavirus. \u2026\u00a0\u201cTrump himself signaled Tuesday some flexibility regarding the convention. \u2018When we signed a few weeks ago, it looked good. And now all of a sudden it\u2019s spiking up a little bit and that\u2019s going to go down,\u2019 the president told television host Greta Van Susteren. \u2018It really depends on the timing. .\u2009.\u2009. We can do a lot of things, but we\u2019re very flexible.\u2019\u2026 For some, going is a way to show their support for Trump. Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), 64, avoided the nominating convention in 2016 as part of his public rejection of Trump\u2019s candidacy \u2026 But the senator\u2019s spokesman \u2026 said Graham, who is facing a contested election in a Trump-friendly state, would be there this time. Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), 50, who is also looking to win another term in November, has signaled she plans to be in Jacksonville, as has Sen. Mike Braun (R-Ind.), 66, who credits Trump with helping him win election in 2018.\u201dNew Hampshire\u2019s Republican governor defended Trump\u2019s decision to hold a rally in the state, but he\u2019s not attending.\u00a0Gov. Chris Sununu assured reporters that Trump's rally in the state could be pulled off safely and without a mandatory mask order, CNN reports. Sununu said that he plans on greeting Trump at some point during his visit, but that it was unlikely that he\u2019d attend the rally, citing health concerns.\u00a0Biden criticized Trump\u2019s campaign for taking aim at Sen. Tammy Duckworth, one of his potential running mates.\u00a0\u201cSpeaking at a virtual fundraiser that Duckworth (D-Ill.) also attended, [Biden] said it was \u2018disgusting, sickening\u2019 of Trump\u2019s circle to question her patriotism and that it was a \u2018reflection of the depravity of what\u2019s going on in the White House right now,\u2019\u201d Sean Sullivan reports. On Sunday, Duckworth was asked on CNN about activists\u2019 demands that statues of George Washington be removed because he owned slaves. \u201cI think we should listen to everybody. I think we should listen to the argument there,\u201d she said. Fox News host Tucker Carlson then attacked Duckworth, calling her an \u201cunimpressive person\u201d and suggesting that she and other Democratic leaders \u201cactually hate America.\u201d Trump shared a clip from Carlson\u2019s show.\u00a0No Americans are known to have died in the reported Russian bounty operation.Marine Gen.

But the Park Police, along with nearly all federal uniformed police, have never worn body cameras.

Subscribe today.arrow-rightIn late May, former World Bank president Jim Yong Kim, an American who has served in Democratic and Republican administrations, waxed incredulous at the lack of a coordinated U.S. strategy\u00a0aimed at combating the novel coronavirus.Kim was making an opening statement during an online roundtable with public health experts from academia, local U.S. health departments and hospital systems about tried-and-true infection containment strategies like testing, contact tracing and isolation, which have been employed effectively in other countries.AD\u00a0\u201cThe thing that\u2019s been driving me crazy is that we\u2019ve just decided that the standard health response \u2014 the only thing that\u2019s worked in any of the countries that suppressed the virus \u2014 is something that we\u2019re just not going to do,\u201d said Kim, who headed the World Health Organization\u2019s HIV response during the second George W. Bush administration and led the World Bank for parts of the Obama and Trump administrations.ADSara Cody, head of the public health department in California's Santa Clara County, known now for orchestrating one of the country\u2019s earliest coronavirus shutdowns, was also on the call. She seemed relieved to hear him say so.\u201cI begin to feel like, am I the one that\u2019s not thinking straight? It feels a little lonely,\u201d Cody said then.ADCody is not alone among U.S. health officials, epidemiologists, virologists and other experts in feeling like she missed the memo saying the world\u2019s richest nation really couldn\u2019t do much to keep this virus from paralyzing it. Many local officials are still asking the same question Kim posed that day: \u201cWhy have we given up on containment?\u201d \u00a0The pressing question is whether political officials have the will to employ reliable measures to curtail the virus.So far, that political will has been largely lacking, from President Trump down to many state and local officials trying to limit the virus's spread without destroying the economy. The country as a whole sets a new high in cases almost every day. The virus is spreading unchecked in states as distant geographically and ideologically as California and Alabama. Arizona has diagnosed more cases per capita than any European country.ADADA new influential model released Tuesday from the University of Washington's Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation predicts 208,255 American deaths by Nov. 1 if no further mitigation efforts are enforced. If mask use becomes widespread, then those projected deaths would drop to 162,807 people.\u201cThe key is we did not have to be here right now,\u201d Leana Wen, a Washington Post contributing columnist and former Baltimore health commissioner and head of Planned Parenthood, told CNN. Wen argued that if the United States employs effective containment measure \u2014 including social distancing and mask wearing \u2014 \u201cthat 200,000 number doesn't have to be inevitable.\u201dAnthony S. Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergies and Infectious Diseases, said Monday that the country is still experiencing the beginning stages of the pandemic.\u201cWe are still knee-deep in the first wave of this, and I would say this would not be considered a wave \u2014 this is a surge and resurgence of infections, superimposed on a baseline that never got down where we wanted to go,\u201d Fauci said.That only hardened the notion of inevitability \u2014 cementing the feeling that the virus would have spread no matter what.\u00a0The Trump administration isn't aggressively messaging around or clamping down on the virus, as the president has violated recommendations from his own health officials to wear a mask in public, not to attend crowded gatherings and to distance from others. Indeed, the Trump administration seems bent on getting Americans to forget about the contagion, even as cases surge in some states.ADAD\u201cWhite House officials also hope Americans will grow numb to the escalating death toll and learn to accept tens of thousands of new cases a day, according to three people familiar with the White House\u2019s thinking, who requested anonymity to reveal internal deliberations. Americans will \u2018live with the virus being a threat,\u2019 in the words of one of those people, a senior administration official,\" according to my colleagues Yasmeen Abutaleb and Josh Dawsey.But\u00a0the virus didn\u2019t have to become so widespread that officials aren't sure they will be able to offer full in-person teaching at American schools in the fall, although Trump is pressuring state and local officials to do so. Just look at other places like Taiwan, South Korea and Hong Kong that have successfully contained the virus.\u00a0The United States, experts say, was not doomed to lose control.\u201cOther countries have taken it seriously, and we have not,\u201d said Ashish Jha, director of the Global Health Institute at Harvard University. \u201cOther [countries] have had a very aggressive shutdown. We have not. Other countries have taken an aggressive approach to testing and tracing and isolation. We have not. Some countries have universal masking laws, and we don\u2019t.\u201dADADKim led the HIV response in Haiti. He oversaw implementation of contact tracing for Ebola in Liberia and Sierra Leone. Still, he said the coronavirus pandemic in the United States is still one of the most difficult public health challenges he has ever encountered, in part because of a convoluted health insurance system and political dysfunction.Certainly, the effort required to contain the virus in the United States sooner would have qualified as Herculean \u2014 adjusted upward for 3,000 years or so of inflation. But there were a host of missed opportunities, from not recognizing the threat early enough, to a botched testing strategy rolled out by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, to a patchwork of erratic orders from states and not the central government.Containment would have required coordinated mobilization of federal and state resources to acquire or manufacture enough personal protective equipment and testing supplies to avoid shortages if at all possible. It would have required outfitting a nation of long understaffed and underfunded health departments. It would have required a cohesive public messaging campaign strong enough to unify to a divided nation behind the common cause of eradicating the virus before hundreds of thousands could die from it.But containment was not impossible here.After the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa, experts from the nonprofit Nuclear Threat Initiative and Johns Hopkins University partnered with the Economist Intelligence Unit and philanthropic groups to develop a Global Health Security Index measuring countries\u2019 readiness to combat dangerous outbreaks based on the answers publicly available data yielded to 140 questions across six categories. In a report published in 2019, the United States ranked as the most prepared country overall.ADAD\u201cOne of the things they didn\u2019t think about was political inaction and political ineptitude,\u201d Jha said of that report, echoing other experts who say the United States has lacked the \u201cpolitical will\u201d to meet the covid-19 moment.Local officials and nationally visible epidemiologists alike say that when federal and state officials downplayed the public health threat posed by the virus, they undermined the sense of urgency necessary to mobilize a country of this size and keep it focused on the problem.As with most public health responses, success is not usually measured in what does happen but what doesn\u2019t. In this case, success would be measured in people not suffering and dying from a virus they needn\u2019t have been exposed to in the first place. Beating the virus, therefore, would feel significant only in hindsight and by comparison, when what could have been is juxtaposed with what was.ADADFighting a pandemic, therefore, requires commitment to consistency and delayed gratification \u2014 something public health experts like Kim and Jha say federal leadership has not modeled for the public. Each day now costs the country more than 500 lives. The country no longer has weeks to prepare testing, tracing and isolation strategies. Our nationwide public health infrastructure cannot fit into a few panicked weeks what it needed to do over months.So far, the cost of American apathy has been 128,566 lives in the United States in four months \u2014 or a fourth of what the country lost to World War II in three and a half years.In the meantime, local officials who haven\u2019t given up on containment are being forced to lead the massive undertaking themselves, knowing that whatever they achieve in their own jurisdictions, they can't control what happens in the next county over. Some have been rewarded with criticism and even death threats from those who believe their efforts cratered the economy or are imposing on individual freedoms.ADADHealth departments from Louisville to Portland, Ore., to Sauk County, Wis., are trying to hire more staff on the fly \u2014 in some cases more than doubling the size of their departments \u2014 so they will also have enough staff to trace cases, assuming they have the testing supplies to identify them in the first place.\u00a0Mayors are begging citizens to wear masks, even as their state governments won\u2019t mandate them. A country\u2019s worth of local officials with tired arms is holding tiny umbrellas they must patch as they go, hoping it will prevent their localities from being inundated with the virus.\u00a0So far, it isn\u2019t really working.\u201cThe current state is really not good,\u201d Fauci said. \u201c \u2026 We went up, never came down to baseline, and now are surging back up. It\u2019s a serious situation we have to address immediately.\u201dMore on the coronavirusFlorida invited the nation to its reopening. Then it became the nation's new coronavirus epicenter.\u00a0\u201cNearly 1 out of every 100 residents is infected with the virus, hospital intensive care units are full or filling up, and big-name visitors who chose Florida for their first post-isolation events are now mired in questions and controversies about safety. Amid escalating infections, Florida, once held up by Trump as a model for how to manage the novel coronavirus, is faring poorly. Residents worry the situation will get much worse,\u201d Cleve R. Wootson Jr., Isaac Stanley-Becker and Lori Rozsa report. \u201cOn Tuesday there were 213,794 cases of the coronavirus in Florida, according to Post data. \u2026 52 intensive care units across more than a third of the state\u2019s counties had reached capacity\u2026\u00a0AD\u201cHospital leaders, lawmakers, physicians, epidemiologists, advocates and others familiar with the state\u2019s response said a false sense of security set in when grim predictions about the virus\u2019s spread in Florida did not come to pass in March and April. \u2026 \u00a0Sports leagues that opted to restart their seasons in Florida will now play in a state that is in worse shape than when the pandemic began. \u2026 The Republican National Convention, scheduled to take place in Jacksonville next month, faces similar questions about safety \u2026 Several hundred doctors have signed a petition that says the convention needs stronger safety measures \u2026 Disney World has announced it would begin to allow visitors back into the Magic Kingdom this week. \u2026\u00a0\u201cThere has been a rise in cases affecting older Floridians as well as those living in nursing homes and other long-term care facilities \u2026 Testing sites across the state are seeing shortages, and the wait time for results is now as long as 10 days \u2026 There were also acute shortages of the antiviral drug remdesivir in parts of the state, causing Democratic members of Florida\u2019s congressional delegation to send a letter Tuesday to HHS Alex Azar asking him to speed the shipment of emergency supplies. \u2026 Amid the array of old and new concerns, teachers across Florida learned they would have to begin preparing their classrooms for an influx of students. \u2026 \u2018I\u2019ve spoken with a lot of my teacher friends, and a lot of them don\u2019t want to go back,\u2019 [first-grade teacher Cara Conlogue said]. \u2018We love our students, we miss them, and we love our jobs. But we don\u2019t feel safe.\u2019\u201dAs the virus spreads and hospitalizations rise, it\u2019s America vs. the world.\u201cTrump pitted America against the world [by] moving to pull the United States out of the WHO while his FBI director accused China of hacking U.S. health-care companies that are researching the novel coronavirus,\u201d Joshua Partlow reports. \u201c\u2018At this very moment, China is working to compromise American health-care organizations, pharmaceutical companies and academic institutions conducting essential covid research,\u2019 [FBI Director Christopher] Wray said in remarks at the Hudson Institute...\u00a0\"His remarks came as cases and hospitalizations in the United States continued to mount \u2026 Arizona reported 117 deaths on Tuesday, a daily record for the state, as more than 3,000 people were being treated in hospitals and ICU beds neared capacity. Texas canceled its annual state fair, the longest-running fair in the country, as more than 8,000 Texans were hospitalized on Monday, a third higher than last week. Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine (R) issued an order Tuesday requiring residents to wear masks in public in seven counties, including those that are home to Cincinnati and Cleveland. \u2026 More than 890 U.S. deaths were reported Tuesday, the highest total in 12 days, amid signs the country\u2019s death rate might be creeping up after falling for the past three months.\u00a0\"Trump has repeatedly complained that not enough attention is being paid to the country\u2019s death rate. ... Scientists say many countries have lower death rates than the United States. \u2026 Anthony S. Fauci, said that although the fatality rate of the coronavirus has dropped, Americans should not be complacent. \u2018It\u2019s a false narrative to take comfort in a lower rate of death,' Fauci [said] \u2026 The lower mortality rate is a result of two factors, he said. The country has gotten better at treating people, particularly through therapies that work in the advanced stages of the disease. And, Fauci said, the mean age of those getting infected has dropped by about 15 years.\u201dTrump\u2019s new visa rules are seen as a way to pressure colleges into reopening.\u201cA directive by the Trump administration that would strip international college students of their U.S. visas if their coursework was entirely online prompted widespread confusion on Tuesday as students scrambled to clarify their statuses and universities reassessed their fall reopening policies amid the coronavirus pandemic,\u201d the Times reports. \u201cThe effect may be to dramatically reduce the number of international students enrolling in the fall. Together with delays in processing visas as a result of the pandemic, immigrant advocates say the new rules, which must still be finalized this month, might discourage many overseas students from attending American universities, where they often pay full tuition. \u2026 Although higher education officials saw the move by the Trump administration as an attempt to force their hands on reopening, which Trump has pushed for, the directive also holds appeal to groups that favor reducing legal immigration to the United States.\u201d\u00a0Southeastern Veterans\u2019 Center, a Pennsylvania nursing home, gave some veterans hydroxychloroquine even without testing them for the coronavirus in what nurses referred to as the \u201ccovid cocktail.\u201d There is no way to know whether the treatment played a role in any deaths at the home, which has attributed 42 fatalities to covid-19. (Debbie Cenziper and Shawn Mulcahy)Arizona has the highest percentage of positive cases in the country. That signals that testing is limited and may only be reaching those who are the sickest as the virus impacts wide swaths of people. (Arizona Republic)Texas saw a sharp $650 million drop in tax revenue as the surge unleashed more budget uncertainty. Texas leaders attributed the decline to consumers shelling out less for cars, gasoline, alcohol and other goods, as well as precipitous drops in travel and tourism.

(NYT)The Trump presidencyTrump\u2019s attacks on mail voting are turning Republicans off absentee ballots.\u00a0The dynamic is alarming \u201cRepublican strategists, who say it could undercut their own candidates, including Trump himself,\u201d Amy Gardner and Josh Dawsey report. \u201cIn several primaries this spring, Democratic voters have embraced mail ballots in far larger numbers than Republicans during a campaign season defined by the pandemic. And when they urge their supporters to vote by mail, GOP campaigns around the country are hearing from more and more Republican voters who say they do not trust absentee ballots, according to multiple strategists. \u2026 The growing Republican antagonism toward voting by mail comes even as the Trump campaign is launching a major absentee-ballot program in every competitive state, according to multiple campaign advisers \u2013 a delicate balancing act \u2026 The president, however, has been arguing the opposite. Nearly daily in recent weeks and usually on Twitter, Trump has attacked mail balloting, leveling many unsubstantiated allegations.\"In a new guidance, the CDC is recommending that voters consider alternatives to casting their ballots in person.\u00a0\u201cThe guidance was issued with little fanfare on June 22 and suggested that state and local election officials take steps to minimize crowds at voting locations, including offering \u2018alternative voting methods,\u2019\u201d Michelle Ye Hee Lee reports. \u201cVoters who want to cast ballots in person should consider showing up at off-peak times, bringing their own black ink pens or touch-screen pens for voting machines, and washing their hands before entering and after leaving the polling location, the guidance said. Workers and voters alike, it said, should wear face coverings.\u201d \u00a0At least five Republican lawmakers are not going to the Jacksonville convention.\u201cSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), 78, indicated Tuesday he will attend the convention, but two other top Senate Republicans, Iowa\u2019s Charles E. Grassley, 86, and Tennessee\u2019s Lamar Alexander, 80, are taking a pass,\u201d Michael Scherer and Josh Dawsey report. \u201cMaine\u2019s Susan Collins, 67, said though a spokesman that she avoids attending the party convention in years when she is facing reelection. Alaska\u2019s Lisa Murkowski, 63, also has no plans to attend, according to a spokesperson, nor does Utah\u2019s Mitt Romney, 73. Collins, Murkowski and Romney have criticized Trump on occasion, making their presence potentially uncomfortable at an event that will largely be a tribute to the president. But Grassley made it clear his decision is motivated solely by fear of contracting the coronavirus. \u2026\u00a0\u201cTrump himself signaled Tuesday some flexibility regarding the convention. \u2018When we signed a few weeks ago, it looked good. And now all of a sudden it\u2019s spiking up a little bit and that\u2019s going to go down,\u2019 the president told television host Greta Van Susteren. \u2018It really depends on the timing. .\u2009.\u2009. We can do a lot of things, but we\u2019re very flexible.\u2019\u2026 For some, going is a way to show their support for Trump. Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), 64, avoided the nominating convention in 2016 as part of his public rejection of Trump\u2019s candidacy \u2026 But the senator\u2019s spokesman \u2026 said Graham, who is facing a contested election in a Trump-friendly state, would be there this time. Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), 50, who is also looking to win another term in November, has signaled she plans to be in Jacksonville, as has Sen. Mike Braun (R-Ind.), 66, who credits Trump with helping him win election in 2018.\u201dNew Hampshire\u2019s Republican governor defended Trump\u2019s decision to hold a rally in the state, but he\u2019s not attending.\u00a0Gov. Chris Sununu assured reporters that Trump's rally in the state could be pulled off safely and without a mandatory mask order, CNN reports. Sununu said that he plans on greeting Trump at some point during his visit, but that it was unlikely that he\u2019d attend the rally, citing health concerns.\u00a0Biden criticized Trump\u2019s campaign for taking aim at Sen. Tammy Duckworth, one of his potential running mates.\u00a0\u201cSpeaking at a virtual fundraiser that Duckworth (D-Ill.) also attended, [Biden] said it was \u2018disgusting, sickening\u2019 of Trump\u2019s circle to question her patriotism and that it was a \u2018reflection of the depravity of what\u2019s going on in the White House right now,\u2019\u201d Sean Sullivan reports. On Sunday, Duckworth was asked on CNN about activists\u2019 demands that statues of George Washington be removed because he owned slaves. \u201cI think we should listen to everybody. I think we should listen to the argument there,\u201d she said. Fox News host Tucker Carlson then attacked Duckworth, calling her an \u201cunimpressive person\u201d and suggesting that she and other Democratic leaders \u201cactually hate America.\u201d Trump shared a clip from Carlson\u2019s show.\u00a0No Americans are known to have died in the reported Russian bounty operation.Marine Gen. Frank McKenzie, \u201ca top U.S. military official confirmed Tuesday that U.S. intelligence assessed that Russia had offered to pay Taliban militants to kill American service members, but said there was no evidence the proposed payment scheme resulted in any U.S. troop deaths,\u201d the WSJ reports. \u201cAccording to the classified assessment, Russia\u2019s GRU military intelligence agency paid members of Afghanistan\u2019s Taliban movement to carry out lethal attacks on U.S. troops in that country. Russia has denied the existence of the arrangement.\u201d\u00a0McKenzie said he\u2019s confident that Iraqis will ask American troops to remain.\u00a0\"I believe the government of Iraq recognizes the true value that the coalition brings to the fight against Daesh (another name for ISIS) in Iraq, and I believe that going forward, they're going to want us to be with them,\" McKenzie said.

(ABC News)\u00a0Trump\u2019s worldview was forged by neglect and trauma at home, according to his niece\u2019s new book.\u201cTrump\u2019s view of the world was shaped by his desire during childhood to avoid his father\u2019s disapproval, according to the niece, Mary L. Trump, whose book is by turns a family history and a psychological analysis of her uncle,\u201d Shane Harris and Michael Kranish report. \u201cBut she writes that as Donald matured, his father came to envy his son\u2019s \u2018confidence and brazenness,\u2019 as well as his seemingly insatiable desire to flout rules and conventions, traits that brought them closer together as Donald became the right-hand man in the family real estate business.\u201dA book by NBC\u2019s Jacob Soboroff quotes top Pence aide Katie Miller questioning immigrant-heavy neighborhoods.\u00a0Miller, a Florida native, singled out Miami\u2019s Little Havana. \u201cI believe that if you come to America, you should assimilate,\u201d Miller said, per Soboroff. \u201cWhy do we need to have Little Havana?\u201d The comments drew ire from Republicans, since older Cuban American voters in Miami are a key part of Trump\u2019s strategy to win Florida in 2020.

But the Park Police, along with nearly all federal uniformed police, have never worn body cameras. Officers and commanders said they expected that their comments and orders made during the operation would be captured electronically, to create a contemporaneous record of the event. But that didn\u2019t happen. \u2018At the conclusion of the demonstrations,\u2019 Park Police Lt. Jonathan Hofflinger said, \u2018we discovered that the radio recorder was not working and did not record any transmissions. However, written radio logs were generated as a redundant practice.

The monuments have also ignited debate among the protesters themselves over where to draw the line on historical figures that some say are too morally compromised to be venerated,\u201d Annie Gowen reports. \u201cThe demonstrators\u2019 views range from support for removal of all monuments to an embrace slow-paced community discussion and historical review. \u2026 For some demonstrators, it\u2019s not the image of a particular president that is important, but how the leader is portrayed.\u201d\u00a0Christopher Columbus symbols are falling across the country.

Subscribe today.arrow-rightOn Tuesday, the Persian hashtag was the most tweeted in Iran. Before long, the country, where the government often seeks to silence dissent, saw \u201csignificant disruption\u201d to some Internet networks, according to NetBlocks, a nongovernmental watchdog. By Thursday, reports circulated that the ruling handing down the death sentences \u2014 upheld despite an appeal claiming the men were tortured into confessing \u2014 could still be overturned.ADIranians have a long history of finding ways to express discontent, despite harsh restrictions on speech and protests. But the seemingly spontaneous response to the approaching execution of demonstrators gained unusual breadth and momentum, amid a new wave of novel coronavirus infections that has strained the country\u2019s health-care system. The online movement also marked the week of the fifth anniversary of the Iran nuclear deal, from which President Trump withdrew in 2018. The return of U.S. sanctions have had stark economic consequences for Iranians.AD\u201cIt\u2019s a particularly bad time to be an Iranian in Iran right now,\u201d said Dina Esfandiary, a fellow at the New York-based Century Foundation. \u201cEconomically, they are really struggling. Politically, there doesn\u2019t seem to be a lot of hope.\u201d\u201cThe anniversary [of the nuclear deal] makes it that much more in your face,\u201d she added.ADAll week, Esfandiary said, many Iranians online shared and were inundated by remembered moments from 2015, when optimism over the country\u2019s prospects soared. The agreement, in theory, promised to end Tehran\u2019s economic and political isolation in return for checks on the country\u2019s nuclear program. Instead, as relations between Washington and Tehran deteriorated under Trump, economic stagnation continued.The value of Iran\u2019s currency is in decline, as inflation and the prices of basic goods rise.ADThe case of the three protesters sentenced to die \u2014 Amirhossein Moradi, 25; Saeed Tamjidi, 27; and Mohammad Rajabi, 25 \u2014 resonated with Iranians from different walks of life because of the severity of the punishment for something many had done themselves, said Holly Dagres, a nonresident fellow at the Atlantic Council, a think tank in Washington.AD\u201cIranians understood that sentencing three men to death for protesting was a message to anyone taking part in future protests,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was an extreme ruling with no evidence, and it angered many Iranians.\u201dLate last year, Iran was rocked by days of nationwide demonstrations against the government, sparked by an overnight hike in gasoline prices. Rights groups estimated that over 300 people were killed by security forces and more than 7,000 arrested during the protests.Iran finally admits it shot and killed \u2018rioters.\u2019 But it still won\u2019t say how many people died in last month\u2019s protests.The three young men facing execution were among those detained and charged with \u201cvandalism and arson with the intent to confront and engage in war with the Islamic Republic of Iran,\u201d according to the New York Times.ADADTheir lawyer said that his clients were tortured and forced to confess. On Tuesday, Iran\u2019s Supreme Court rejected an appeal and upheld the death sentences.Soon after, Instagram, Telegram and Twitter, which is banned in Iran, lit up with angry responses. Famous Iranian artists, athletes, bloggers and even some politicians and clerics joined the fray \u2014 alongside everyday Iranians, for whom the risks of participating in such discourses is often even higher.Internet campaigns always run the risk of appearing larger than they really are due to bots, but Amir Rashidi, a digital researcher, told the New York Times that he had \u201cnever seen a hashtag with this level of participation from Iranians everywhere.\u201dLast year, Iran executed at least 251 people, second only to China, according to Amnesty International, a human rights group. The country has recently executed prisoners on charges ranging from drinking alcohol to spying for the CIA.ADAD\u201cThere\u2019s been a growing movement inside Iran led by celebrities, activists and charities that are pushing for those sentenced to death to be forgiven,\u201d said Dagres. \u201cThe practice of executions is increasingly being seen as archaic, and this is in part why Iranians were quick to take to social media to express their disapproval.\u201dOn Wednesday, Trump entered the fray, tweeting his opposition to the executions in both Persian and English. The tweets came a day after his administration carried out the first federal execution in the United States since 2003.The Trump administration has adopted a hawkish stance on Iran, which nearly came to a head in January, when the United States killed Qasem Soleimani, a top Iranian military leader, in a Baghdad airstrike, dragging the countries to the brink of armed conflict.Iranians were unlikely to take Trump\u2019s support seriously, said Esfandiary.Any real change, she said, would be driven by Iranians, who are looking for ways to show discontent without taking major risks. \u201cThat\u2019s why I think you are going to see an uptake in campaigns like this,\u201d she said.", "comment": "11 Comments", "topic": "Middle East"}, {"cover": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/OWNATWSYJQI6RCBWUSQSHQ2ZVM.jpghttps://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/OWNATWSYJQI6RCBWUSQSHQ2ZVM.jpg", "title": "Israel\u2019s outgoing U.N. ambassador: \u2018We have to fight anti-Semitism on all fronts\u2019", "date": "Jul 14, 2020", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/israels-outgoing-un-ambassador-we-have-to-fight-anti-semitism-on-all-fronts/2020/07/14/4aaeddac-c2c3-11ea-9fdd-b7ac6b051dc8_story.html", "keyword": "China and Security", "website": "the Washington Post", "author": "Souad Mekhennet", "content": "Israel\u2019s outgoing ambassador to the United Nations, Danny Danon, spoke to The Washington Post about his five years in the position, security threats in the region and anti-Semitisim. The following is a lightly edited transcript.Support our journalism. Subscribe today.arrow-rightQ: On Jan.\u200927 of this year, you tweeted a video to remember the victims of the Holocaust and included the voices of several other ambassadors to the U.N. Why did you do that?A: The issue of anti-Semitism is very important to me \u2014 it is a global issue. We should not be silent about it. That\u2019s why I dedicated a lot of effort to educate my colleagues at the U.N. about the danger of hate [and] anti-Semitism.Q: In this fight against anti-Semitism, how important is it to also fight the glorification of the Nazis or Nazi symbols?ADA: I think we have to fight anti-Semitism on all fronts. Today with social media it is a challenge, and we have debates with scholars and legal experts about what we can do regarding, hate crimes, how to deal with freedom of speech and where we draw the line. We cherish freedom of speech, but we cannot cherish freedom of hate.ADQ: Were you directly confronted with anti-Semitism during your time at the U.N.?A: I had difficult moments, both when you hear the voices coming from Iran or the hate crime in Pittsburgh here in the U.S.Q: You mentioned in interviews trips to Dubai and to other Arab countries. How is Israel\u2019s relationship with the Arab states at the moment?ADA: It\u2019s a very important and strategic relationship, beneficial for both sides. We share the common threat over the Iranian regime, which is threatening the entire region.We collaborate and can collaborate more. The issue is whether the Arab states actually recognize, publicly, the accomplishments and cooperation. I think it is about time to move to the next level and to see what we can do publicly, not only behind closed doors.Q: The United Arab Emirates\u2019 ambassador to the United States has spoken publicly about his country\u2019s relationship with Israel and said it\u2019s either \u201cannexation or normalization,\u201d stressing that your country\u2019s annexation plans would make it impossible to go ahead with a normalization process.ADADA: We welcome his involvement and input. It\u2019s important we do take it into consideration and to have a dialogue \u2014 weather it is with Arab or European countries, the U.S. or Russia, China \u2014 it is very important for us, and it is part of the process. But at the end of the day, the Israeli government will have to reach a decision about the issue of applying sovereignty.Q: Are you communicating with any Arab ambassadors over the annexation topic at the moment?A: We always have open channels of communication. We do agree most of the time on most issues. But even if there are issues we don\u2019t agree on, we still discuss them.Q: The Palestinians announced they have ended security cooperation with Israel.ADA: It is not the first time we hear an announcement similar to that one.And this security cooperation is not only beneficial to Israel but for the Palestinians themselves. In a few occasions, we shared information with them that helped prevent terrorist attacks not against Israeli but actually against the Palestinian Authority.ADQ: Is there any attempt at the moment to bring the Palestinians back to the table, to discuss and negotiate?A: We are open-minded. I have been approaching President [Mahmoud] Abbas when he came to the U.N. the last time. .\u2009.\u2009. We are willing to go back to the negotiating table. But it\u2019s difficult to find a good partner on the other side.ADQ: How do you see at the moment the threat coming from Hamas?A: I think Hamas is continuing to occupy Gaza. Instead of supporting the population, they are investing in tunnels and weapons, and that\u2019s unfortunate because it means that they\u2019re actually investing in the future conflict with Israel instead of investing in the future of the Palestinians.Q: Where do things stand with Iran? Do Western countries see eye to eye with Israel when it comes to the question of how to deal with Iran?ADA: We believe the Iranians are not only posing a threat to Israel but to the entire community of the world. In October we have the issue of the arm embargo, whether it will be extended or not. We encourage all countries to support the position of the U.S. and not allow Iran to continue and increase the involvement in supplying arms to different groups in the Middle East.ADQ: Has the Trump administration handled the threat you see coming from Iran in a way that was sufficient?A: We are grateful for the decision to pull out of the Iran deal, it was very important.And we appreciate the strong stance of President Trump and [Secretary of State Mike] Pompeo on this issue. We have stated many times, we will not allow Iran to achieve nuclear weapons, no matter what. We welcome the leadership of the U.S. on this issue.ADQ: There was an explosion in the nuclear facility in Iran. How important was this facility for Iran?A: We will not get into a specific incident. But overall, our policy is very clear about not allowing Iran to achieving the nuclear weapon.Q: What are your plans? What will you be doing next?A: I am concluding five years. It\u2019s a very long term. .\u2009.\u2009. I intend to stay involved in public service. I gained a lot of experience, knowledge and connections that I intend to use in order to support Israel.\n\n", "comment": "0 Comments", "topic": "National Security"}, {"cover": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/KCV3J3WCXMI6VCIINCRLT2XJ4A.jpghttps://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/KCV3J3WCXMI6VCIINCRLT2XJ4A.jpg", "title": "Why Low-Earth Orbit Satellites Are the New Space Race", "date": "Jul 10, 2020", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/why-low-earth-orbit-satellites-are-the-new-space-race/2020/07/10/51ef1ff8-c2bb-11ea-8908-68a2b9eae9e0_story.html", "keyword": "China and Security", "website": "the Washington Post", "author": "", "content": "In a world divided between digital haves and have-nots, billionaires Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos are trying to close the gap. The two entrepreneurs separately aim to launch thousands of small satellites to zip around the globe in what\u2019s known as low-Earth orbit, or LEO. Their plan is to offer high-end internet coverage for clients like governments, mining companies and shipping conglomerates, as well as providing it to regions too remote or poor to install it on the ground. Startup costs are in the billions of dollars.Support our journalism. Subscribe today.arrow-right1. How low is low?LEO satellites operate from 500 kilometers (311 miles) to 2,000 kilometers above the Earth\u2019s surface. Traditional communication satellites are stationed far higher, at roughly 36,000 kilometers, and travel in so-called geosynchronous orbits, moving at the speed of the Earth\u2019s rotation and appearing to float motionless above a fixed point.ADAD2. What\u2019s the advantage of a lower orbit?A shorter trip is a faster trip, so the time needed for data to be sent and returned -- what\u2019s known as latency -- is lower for LEO satellites than for those farther out. And because signals can travel more rapidly through the vacuum of space than through fiber-optic cables, LEO satellites have the potential to rival or possibly exceed the fastest ground-based networks.3. How fast is fast?OneWeb, a London-based company originally backed by Richard Branson that\u2019s begun launching washing machine-sized LEO satellites, recorded an average latency of 32 milliseconds in July 2019 on transmissions between space and South Korea. Musk, the founder of Space Exploration Technologies Corp., has said that his Starlink satellite system is aiming for a latency of 20 milliseconds initially, which he hopes eventually to cut in half. Talk like that has sparked speculation that financial firms could outpace their terrestrial securities trading operations. High-orbit systems, by contrast, have a median latency of nearly 600 milliseconds for a round trip. That\u2019s adequate for broadcasting but is a barrier to real-time two-way communication.ADAD4. What\u2019s the downside of a low orbit?The speed needed for stable orbit -- achieved by balancing an object\u2019s inertia with the Earth\u2019s gravity -- diminishes with distance. High-flying geostationary satellites travel at about 11,000 kilometers per hour to avoid falling back to Earth, while LEO satellites must travel at about 27,000 kph, completing a full circuit of the planet in 90 to 120 minutes. That means each individual satellite is only in direct contact with a ground transmitter for a brief period and is why LEO projects involve so many satellites: OneWeb says that in its system, receivers are able to get a consistent signal because a new satellite will always fly into range and pre-emptively replace the signal of the satellite which is about to fly beyond the horizon, about every 2 minutes.5. Are LEO satellites new?ADADNo. Most of the Earth\u2019s approximately 2,700 active satellites are already in LEO, according to a monitoring group called the Union of Concerned Scientists. For instance, a network belonging to U.S.-based Iridium Communications Inc. allows voice and data communication from hand-held satellite phones, and has been operating since 1998. Previous efforts led to bankruptcies by Iridium and Globalstar Inc., also a U.S. company. What\u2019s new is the sheer scale of recent proposals, with the big firms planning to launch satellites in the thousands. The new ventures are counting on savings from smaller, cheaper satellites and reusable rockets, along with more powerful software capable of tracking all those hand-offs.6. When will this start?SpaceX has launched more than 480 of a planned 12,000 satellites; in October 2019, the company sought permission for 30,000 more. Both Musk and OneWeb have said that partial networks could go into service in 2021. State-owned China Aerospace Science & Industry Corp. is proposing a network of 156 satellites by 2022. Bezos\u2019s Amazon.com Inc. has requested permission to launch 3,236 satellites. Meanwhile, traditional operators like ViaSat Inc. and Eutelsat Communications SA are continuing to invest in more powerful geostationary satellites, collaborating with companies such as Facebook Inc. to beam broadband to rural areas and airplanes.ADAD7. Are they going to make money?Many satellite companies never have. SpaceX has said completing Starlink may cost more than $10 billion, though Musk estimated in 2019 it could bring in $30 billion to $50 billion per year once fully operational. (He says the satellites will produce the money needed for his ultimate goal of settling Mars.) To reach the four billion people on Earth who now lack high-speed internet access, the satellite companies aspire to sell their services to governments, nonprofits and telecommunications providers. OneWeb, which had signed contracts it says could lead to Wi-Fi hotspots connected to its satellites, was acquired in July by the U.K. government and an arm of Indian telecommunications tycoon Sunil Mittal\u2019s Bharti Enterprises Ltd. in an auction after filing for bankruptcy.8. Who regulates LEO?ADADIn a sense, no one. But satellite operators have to get approval for their launch and orbit plans from national communications regulators, and anyone planning to sell services to the U.S. needs to go before the Federal Communications Commission. The International Telecommunication Union coordinates the allocation of frequencies for communications.9. Is there room up there for all these satellites?No one knows how close existing satellites are to triggering the Kessler Effect -- named after NASA scientist Donald Kessler, who raised the possibility that if space becomes too crowded, there will be collisions that trigger a catastrophic chain reaction of debris, causing yet more collisions. The U.S. Air Force is developing a ground based radar system known as the Space Fence that\u2019s meant to track satellites and debris; in September 2019, the European Space Agency moved a space probe after being warned it could come too close to a Starlink satellite. Another worry is that a more crowded sky will ruin the view. Astronomers complained after the SpaceX launch about sunlight they suspected was reflecting off the satellites, and Musk has asked his team to make them less reflective.(An earlier version of this story corrected number of Iridium satellites currently in orbit in fourth answer.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P.", "comment": "13 Comments", "topic": "Business"}, {"cover": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/OQ4DSBUQOQI6VEZCUKPHL374SM.jpghttps://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/OQ4DSBUQOQI6VEZCUKPHL374SM.jpg", "title": "The beginning of the end for ever-rising Pentagon budgets", "date": "Jul 14, 2020", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/07/14/beginning-end-ever-rising-pentagon-budgets/", "keyword": "China and Security", "website": "the Washington Post", "author": "Katrina vanden Heuvel", "content": "When Congress returns to work, progressives in the House and Senate will launch the first round of what will be a central debate in the coming years: challenging ever-rising Pentagon budgets. After years of virtually reflexive bipartisan support for shoveling more money at the military, progressives, led by Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), as well as Reps. Barbara Lee (D-Calif.) and Mark Pocan (D-Wis.), will push for a 10 percent cut in the Pentagon\u2019s top-line budget. The $74 billion in savings would instead be used for distressed communities\u2019 vital needs.Support our journalism. Subscribe today.arrow-rightThe president, of course, has boasted about the money he has shoveled to the Pentagon, delighting particularly in the baroque weapons he calls \u201cincredible equipment\u201d and a new \u201csuper duper missile.\u201d Democrats have largely gone along, pushing only for a bit larger piece of the pie for domestic purposes. The Sanders-Lee-Pocan amendment marks the end of that dance. As Sanders summarized, \u201cIt is time to fundamentally change our national priorities. In the midst of the worst public health crisis in over 100 years and the most severe economic downturn since the Great Depression, we do not need to authorize $740.5 billion in bombs, weapons, fighter jets and endless wars.\u201dJust as in most states and localities, spending on police and prisons outweighs what the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. described as \u201cprograms of social uplift,\u201d so the Pentagon\u2019s bloated budget consumes an ever-increasing portion of federal discretionary spending. The Defense Department and related appropriations such as the Energy Department\u2019s nuclear budget now comprise more than half of the national discretionary budget. Last year\u2019s $732 billion in defense spending exceeded the next 10 largest defense budgets \u2014 including China and Russia \u2014 combined.ADADThis money continues to flow even as the Pentagon remains riddled with waste, fraud and abuse, with billions upon billions in wasteful spending. And that\u2019s not counting the more than $6.4 trillion that has been squandered in the endless wars in the Middle East and Asia which have only added to our insecurity.As the pandemic has shown so starkly, military force has no answer for the rising international security challenges we now face \u2014 emergent diseases; extreme weather and climate change; destabilizing inequality and poverty; corrosive corruption; and crime. These demand investment in science, diplomacy, development, enforcement of white-collar crimes and so on \u2014 not endless wars on the other side of the world.The folly of our current posture is now confronting questioning from across the political spectrum. The libertarian Charles Koch Institute calls for moving to a \u201cgrand strategy of restraint\u201d that would allow deep cuts in military spending. The Moral Budget from the progressive Poor People\u2019s Campaign calls for \u201c$350 billion in annual military spending cuts that would make the nation and the world more secure.\u201dADADThe cuts across the board of the Sanders-Lee-Pocan resolution, in fact, echo the strategy employed by the Republican president who knew the military the best. Dwight D. Eisenhower, who warned Americans that a military-industrial complex would generate threats to justify expanded budgets, kept military spending under control in his administration by putting a lid on Pentagon budgets. That forced the services, the arms contractors, the lobbyists and the fixers to fight each other for who got what under the lid. The resulting donnybrook gave Congress inside information on waste and fraud that might otherwise have gone unreported.Here, as elsewhere, a newly energized progressive movement, and emboldened leadership in the Congress are forcing the issue. Biden has yet to speak forcefully on the subject of military spending. In the past, Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) have generally signed off on rising military spending in trade for domestic spending; now, Schumer has endorsed the Sanders amendment.The economic and human devastation wrought by the coronavirus pandemic \u2014 and the grotesque bungling of the administration in face of the threat \u2014 demands new priorities, to suppress the pandemic, put people back to work safely in the short term, and to address the glaring shortcomings exposed by the threat. Those deficiencies include our impoverished public health capacity, the absence of universal day care and sick leave, the lack of an organized workers\u2019 voices, institutionalized racial disparities and more.ADADThe Sanders-Lee-Pocan amendments aren\u2019t likely to pass. They will be hard-pressed even to get the support of a majority of Democrats. But, in the long run, the Pentagon is not likely to escape the growing imperative of change. And thanks to these amendments, legislators won\u2019t be able to hide what side of history they are on.Read more:Josh Rogin: The White House-Pentagon feud is bad for democracyHugh Hewitt: The fourth rescue bill needs to repair damage done to the economy and national securityDavid Ignatius: How the Pentagon is struggling to stay out of politics", "comment": "95 Comments", "topic": "Opinions"}, {"cover": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/VHZ6NOGATAI6VNHWZM443CKA7M.jpghttps://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/VHZ6NOGATAI6VNHWZM443CKA7M.jpg", "title": "It\u2019s America vs. world as coronavirus spreads and hospitalizations rise", "date": "Jul 7, 2020", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/coronavirus-america-versus-world/2020/07/07/977c8dea-c06c-11ea-b4f6-cb39cd8940fb_story.html", "keyword": "China and Security", "website": "the Washington Post", "author": "Joshua Partlow", "content": "Amid a resurgent pandemic and rising hospitalizations, President Trump pitted America against the world on Tuesday, moving to pull the United States out of the World Health Organization while his FBI director accused China of hacking U.S. health-care companies that are researching the novel coronavirus.Support our journalism.

The Fake News should be reporting these most important of facts, but they don\u2019t!\u201d Trump tweeted.Scientists say many countries have lower death rates than the United States.The nation\u2019s top infectious-disease expert, Anthony S. Fauci, said Tuesday that although the fatality rate of the coronavirus has dropped, Americans should not be complacent.AD\u201cIt\u2019s a false narrative to take comfort in a lower rate of death,\u201d Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said during a Facebook Live news conference with Sen. Doug Jones (D-Ala.). \u201cThere\u2019s so many other things that are very dangerous and bad about this virus.\u201dADThe lower mortality rate is a result of two factors, he said. The country has gotten better at treating people, particularly through therapies that work in the advanced stages of the disease. And, Fauci said, the mean age of those getting infected has dropped by about 15 years.Compared with the older population, young people generally face less-severe consequences from the virus, unless they have underlying medical complications, he said. Still, some young people have been hospitalized or have required intensive care, and there could be long-term health implications.AD\u201cThe death rate is lower, I admit that, because people in general who are young are healthier,\u201d Fauci said. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean that you could not get seriously ill.\u201dIn Brazil, home to the world\u2019s second-worst outbreak, President Bolsonaro became at least the third world leader to contract the virus. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson was treated in intensive care in April and has since recovered. Honduran President Juan Orlando Hern\u00e1ndez, who was hospitalized last month, said last week that he was leaving the hospital and returning to work.ADBolsonaro, 65, has repeatedly played down the seriousness of the pandemic, even as Brazil has reported more than 1.6\u00a0million confirmed cases and 65,000 deaths. He has been a skeptic of the pandemic as he has pushed Brazilians to get back to work and saying that with his own \u201chistory as an athlete, if I were infected by the virus, I wouldn\u2019t need to worry.\u201dADHe was tested after developing symptoms that included a fever.Tensions about how to handle border-hopping during the outbreak also flared again this week.New federal guidance that international students must take classes in person to legally stay in the United States this fall has left university officials scrambling to adapt while making students fearful of deportation. The guidance from the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency said that foreign students won\u2019t be allowed to have visas for programs that are fully online during the fall semester, nor will they be allowed into the country. Though some universities, including Harvard, have pledged to create an on-campus experience for students \u2014 especially those in their first year \u2014 many have said classes will be online only even if students are on campus.ADADThe White House, meanwhile, has been pushing for schools to open in the fall. Trump said he would pressure governors to open buildings because in-person education is essential for the well-being of students, parents, and the country. \u201cWe want to reopen the schools,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want people to make political statements or do it for political reasons. They think it\u2019s going to be good for them politically, so they keep schools closed. No way.\u201dThe Trump administration is also seeking to expand testing in hard-hit areas. The Department of Health and Human Services said that it is dispatching private contractors to three communities \u2014 Edinburg, Tex.; Baton Rouge; and Jacksonville \u2014 to administer 5,000 free tests per day in coming weeks.\u201cThe Trump administration is doubling down on support to areas hard hit by covid-19,\u201d the illness caused by the virus, said Brett P. Giroir, an HHS assistant secretary who is the administration\u2019s coordinator for diagnostic testing for the virus.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also published a study on Tuesday that offered further evidence that the virus disproportionately affects workers of color. The study looked at workers in 329 U.S. meat and poultry facilities across 23 states and found that the majority of cases occurred among Hispanic employees (56\u00a0percent), followed by 19\u00a0percent in black employees, 13\u00a0percent in white employees and 12\u00a0percent in Asian employees.The rates are disproportionate to employee demographics at the facilities. The workforce breakdown is 39\u00a0percent white, 30\u00a0percent Hispanic, 25\u00a0percent black and 6\u00a0percent Asian, the report said.Meat and poultry plant workers are particularly vulnerable to the rapid spread of the virus because of the working and living conditions that are common in the industry: prolonged close contact among co-workers, eight- to 12-hour shifts, shared workspaces, group housing and shared transportation.\n\nEmily Rauhala, Devlin Barrett, Amy Goldstein, Brittany Shammas, Sean Sullivan, Laura Meckler and Terrence McCoy contributed to this report.", "comment": "939 Comments", "topic": "National"}, {"cover": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/LFX2M5F4SEI6VPNPUEU7SIICN4.jpghttps://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/LFX2M5F4SEI6VPNPUEU7SIICN4.jpg", "title": "Trump and Biden campaigns shift focus to coronavirus as pandemic surges", "date": "Jul 6, 2020", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-and-biden-campaigns-shift-focus-to-coronavirus-as-pandemic-surges/2020/07/06/53a4ec50-bd62-11ea-80b9-40ece9a701dc_story.html", "keyword": "China and Security", "website": "the Washington Post", "author": "Yasmeen AbutalebJosh Dawsey", "content": "The Trump and Biden presidential campaigns now see the coronavirus response as the preeminent force shaping the results of November\u2019s election, prompting both camps to try to refocus their campaigns more heavily on the pandemic, according to officials and advisers of both campaigns.Support our journalism. Subscribe today.arrow-rightAdvisers to presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden see the covid-19 crisis as perhaps the clearest way yet to contrast the former vice president with President Trump, using the stumbling response and renewed surge in cases as ways to paint Trump as uninformed, incapable of empathy and concerned only about his own political standing.Trump\u2019s advisers, by contrast, are seeking ways to reframe his response to the coronavirus \u2014 even as the president himself largely seeks to avoid the topic because he views it as a political loser. They are sending health officials to swing states, putting doctors on TV in regional markets where the virus is surging, crafting messages on an economic recovery and writing talking points for allies to deliver to potential voters.ADADThe goal is to convince Americans that they can live with the virus \u2014 that schools should reopen, professional sports should return, a vaccine is likely to arrive by the end of the year and the economy will continue to improve.White House officials also hope Americans will grow numb to the escalating death toll and learn to accept tens of thousands of new cases a day, according to three people familiar with the White House\u2019s thinking, who requested anonymity to reveal internal deliberations. Americans will \u201clive with the virus being a threat,\u201d in the words of one of those people, a senior administration official.Stay safe and informed with our free Coronavirus Updates newsletter\u201cThey\u2019re of the belief that people will get over it or if we stop highlighting it, the base will move on and the public will learn to accept 50,000 to 100,000 new cases a day,\u201d said a former administration official in touch with the campaign.ADADTrump campaign officials and advisers recognize that the administration\u2019s coronavirus response presents one of their biggest political challenges in coming months, as voters generally disapprove of Trump\u2019s handling of the virus and the push to reopen, while still giving Trump higher marks than Biden on the economy.Faced with some of Trump\u2019s tide of problematic comments \u2014 such as suggesting lungs could be cleaned of coronavirus with disinfectants \u2014 the administration also plans to rely on surrogates to speak on the issue, including Vice President Pence and White House coronavirus response coordinator Deborah Birx. Several advisers have proposed coronavirus events in upcoming weeks that Trump has agreed to participate in that will highlight a potential vaccine and economic recovery, according to two campaign advisers and a White House official.Several advisers said Trump is still shellshocked by the faltering economy, protests over racial injustice and his declining political fortunes. Some close to Trump, including a range of Republican senators and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), have encouraged him to focus on blaming China for the pandemic and to emphasize the administration\u2019s successes in the response, including preventing a widely feared ventilator shortage and increasing the country\u2019s testing capacity to 500,000 tests a day.\u201cAnytime you\u2019re an incumbent, you kind of own these things more than the challengers,\u201d said Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), adding that the election will hinge on whether the economy has made a robust recovery, which can happen only if the outbreak comes under control.ADADBiden has ramped up attacks on Trump\u2019s response and outlined how he would place the federal government at the center of the response if he is elected, a contrast to Trump\u2019s decision to largely leave it to the states to procure testing kits and personal protective equipment and decide when and how to reopen. Trump reiterated his belief on Wednesday that the virus would simply \u201cdisappear,\u201d despite new daily infections surpassing 50,000 for the first time last week and more than 127,000 Americans dying from the disease.Trump\u2019s May days: A month of distractions and grievances as nation marks bleak coronavirus milestone\u201cFrom really January on, Vice President Biden has been laser-focused on the rising risk to the American people presented by this pandemic,\u201d said Biden campaign adviser Ariana Berengaut. \u201cYou can almost imagine them side by side \u2014 Trump\u2019s leadership and Biden\u2019s leadership. .\u2009.\u2009. Trump has no plan for tomorrow, no plan for a week from now, so there is absolutely no plan for the fall, and that\u2019s what encapsulates the whole arc of that contrast.\u201dPolls have shown Americans growing increasingly worried about the course of the outbreak. A Gallup poll released Thursday found a new high of 65 percent of Americans saying that the coronavirus situation is getting worse \u2014 up from 48 percent the week before.And Trump\u2019s approval rating has steadily slipped since March. In a Washington Post average of polls, Biden led Trump by 11 points in June, up from an eight-point lead in May and a six- to seven-point lead between February and April.ADAD\u201cTrump is increasingly defined in voters\u2019 minds by his failing response to the coronavirus crisis, and virtually every action and position he\u2019s taken have been wildly out of sync with where the public is at on what should be done,\u201d said Democratic pollster Geoff Garin. \u201cBiden now has a remarkable opportunity to contrast himself with this failure of leadership that a large majority of voters see so clearly.\u201dRepublican leaders now say everyone should wear a mask \u2014 even as Trump refuses and mocks some who doBiden delivered a 20-minute speech on Tuesday outlining actions he would take as president to bring the outbreak under control and criticized Trump for having \u201csurrendered\u201d to the virus and refusing to wear a mask in public.Biden\u2019s campaign plans to continue hammering Trump for what they perceive as his failed response and highlighting many of his most controversial statements, including his claim that he asked officials to \u201cslow down the testing,\u201d his push of unproven drugs, his accusation that health-care workers were stealing masks and his sidelining of scientists.ADADThey also plan to put out policies and proposals as the course of the virus changes, one Biden campaign adviser said, to continue making the case that \u201cthe country would be in a much different place today .\u2009.\u2009. if Joe Biden had been the president in January.\u201d\u201cMake no mistake: We are still in a deep, deep jobs hole because Donald Trump has so badly bungled the response to the coronavirus and now has basically given up responding at all,\u201d Biden said Thursday. \u201cMillions more Americans would still have their jobs today if Donald Trump had done his job. And many of the jobs that have now come back should never have been lost in the first place.\u201dTrump campaign spokesman Tim Murtaugh said the campaign plans to highlight the \u201cradical ramping up of testing,\u201d along with private-sector collaboration that secured more ventilators than the country eventually needed.ADAD\u201cEvery time he opens his mouth, he gives the same speech,\u201d Murtaugh said of Biden. \u201cThey act as if Biden is sitting in some position of authority to be armchair quarterbacking on this.\u201dWhite House spokeswoman Sarah Matthews said in a statement that \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s response has marshaled the power and might of the greatest mobilization since World War II\u201d to combat the coronavirus and that he \u201cwill rebuild the most inclusive economy in history.\u201dA key problem is that Trump himself has resisted focusing on the pandemic as deaths have climbed, saying that no matter what he does, it will not be a \u201cgood story\u201d for him, one senior administration official said.Biden escalates criticism of Trump on coronavirus as cases grow nationwideTrump has attacked Biden for the Obama administration\u2019s response to the 2009 H1N1 swine flu outbreak and what the former vice president said after Trump decided on Jan. 31 to ban most travel from China to stem the spread of the coronavirus.From April 2009 to April 2010, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated that there were about 12,500 deaths from the swine flu \u2014 far fewer than the 30,000 to 90,000 deaths once projected.Trump has also repeatedly referenced Biden\u2019s comments following the China travel ban. \u201cWe are in the midst of a crisis with the coronavirus. We need to lead the way with science \u2014 not Donald Trump\u2019s record of hysteria, xenophobia and fearmongering. He is the worst possible person to lead our country through a global health emergency,\u201d Biden wrote on Twitter on Feb. 1, the day after the China travel restrictions were announced.Fact Checker: How specific were Biden\u2019s warnings on coronavirus?Communications aides hope to work with Trump so that he can talk about his administration\u2019s response in a more effective and comprehensive way and are planning coronavirus-focused events for coming weeks, according to two senior administration officials, who requested anonymity to discuss internal deliberations.The campaign and White House have compiled extensive talking points in an effort to reframe the administration\u2019s response \u2014 or, at the very least, \u201cfight it back closer to a draw,\u201d one of the senior administration officials said.\n\n\n\n", "comment": "2k Comments", "topic": "Politics"}, {"cover": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/HB6OACWKSAI6VMHD2VN5UB6WNI.jpghttps://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/HB6OACWKSAI6VMHD2VN5UB6WNI.jpg", "title": "Oxford coronavirus vaccine safe and promising, according to early human trial results published in the Lancet", "date": "Jul 20, 2020", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/oxford-coronavirus-vaccine-phase-1-lancet/2020/07/20/12fbbc92-c857-11ea-a825-8722004e4150_story.html", "keyword": "China and Security", "website": "the Washington Post", "author": "William BoothCarolyn Y.

Subscribe today.arrow-rightThe study, published in the British medical journal the Lancet and involving 1,077 volunteers, was described as promising. A second report in the same publication on a Chinese vaccine showed what researchers not involved in the study described as modest positive results.The two vaccines are among 23 candidates now being tested in human trials, according to a running tally kept by the World Health Organization. More than 130 others are in preclinical studies. None have yet been proved to protect people from infection or illness. And scientists caution that no one yet knows what level of immune response will be a shield against the virus in the real world through a cross section of humanity \u2014 young to old, healthy to those with preexisting conditions.ADADBut with hopes soaring that a number of vaccines will soon emerge to quiet the global pandemic, governments are making massive investments and pharmaceutical companies are readying production.China approved the use of its vaccine within its military in late June.The U.S. government has pledged up to $1.2\u00a0billion toward the Oxford effort and secured a promise of 300\u00a0million doses by October. A European alliance has claimed 400\u00a0million doses, while the British government has dibs on 100\u00a0million doses, alongside another possible candidate being developed by Imperial College London.British Prime Minister Boris Johnson was enthusiastic about the early-stage Oxford results.AD\u201cThis is very positive news. A huge well done to our brilliant, world-leading scientists & researchers at @UniofOxford,\u201d Johnson tweeted Monday. \u201cThere are no guarantees, we\u2019re not there yet & further trials will be necessary \u2014 but this is an important step in the right direction.\u201dADThe record-breaking pace of vaccine developers has heartened many who want to see the virus tamed in the new year and life return to normal.But much about this novel pathogen remains unknown. Last week, British researchers reported that people infected with the virus may see defensive antibodies against it fade within months, raising the possibility that long-term protection may be elusive \u2014 and that treatments may offer more promise than vaccines.ADStill, vaccine researchers at Oxford and elsewhere are optimistic they can stimulate the production of T cells that can stay in circulation for years and serve as a permanent praetorian guard against infection.\u201cWe hope this means the immune system will remember the virus, so that our vaccine will protect people for an extended period,\u201d Andrew Pollard, lead author of the Oxford study, said in a statement. \u201cHowever, we need more research before we can confirm the vaccine effectively protects against SARS-CoV-2 infection, and for how long any protection lasts.\u201dADLarge-scale, real-world trials of the Oxford vaccine \u2014 named ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 \u2014 are underway in Britain, Brazil and South Africa. The United States plans to test it later this summer, along with a handful of other candidates, in clinical trials, each with about 30,000 volunteers.ADThe Oxford vaccine was made from a weakened and non-replicating version of a common cold virus, an adenovirus. It has been engineered to express a bit of the coronavirus that produces the spike protein that the virus uses to enter and infect human cells.The early trials found no serious side effects.Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia, said it is still unclear how protective the immune memory in T cells will be against the coronavirus, in part because immune memory is typically more valuable against pathogens that have a longer incubation period than the coronavirus.ADHis biggest concern about the Oxford study was that while the vaccine triggered the immune system best when a second shot was administered, that two-dose regimen was only tested in 10 patients.AD\u201cI\u2019d want to see, in a Phase 2 trial, two doses consistently inducing a neutralizing antibody response, and that it\u2019s relatively long-lived \u2014 not months, not a few weeks,\u201d Offit said.Infectious-disease experts caution that vaccines must be widely administered to protect the general population, and in an era of widespread skepticism and even overt hostility toward research and scientists, any vaccine that underperforms or causes serious side effects will set back the effort.An editorial in the Lancet warned, \u201cThe race for a vaccine moves fast, as the need for a solution is evident, but we cannot forget that safety is of the highest importance.\u201dADADIn a reflection of how widely anticipated even very early vaccine results have become during the pandemic, results from the Oxford trial were leaked to news outlets in the days before publication, and the hype continued to build over the weekend.\u201cTo me, the message is it looks like it warrants further study. There\u2019s no showstopper here,\u201d said Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at the Baylor College of Medicine. \u201cThe bottom line is there\u2019s maybe some promise, but definitely you cannot declare victory by any means on these two vaccines. There\u2019s nothing here that would cause me to say we can now release this to the public.\u201dThe Chinese candidate was tested in 500 people and shown to be relatively safe, causing side effects such as pain at the injection site, fevers and headaches, but with some severe reactions. It induced an immune response in most participants. However, the vaccine\u2019s early performance has been disappointing to some scientists, and there have been worries that there may already be a reason it will not work on many people. There is substantial immunity in the human population to the technology at the core of the vaccine \u2014 a harmless virus that is used to ferry in a gene that triggers the immune response to the coronavirus.ADADThe vaccine triggered the production of neutralizing antibodies that can block the virus in only about half the test subjects \u2014 59\u00a0percent of those given a high dose and 47\u00a0percent given a lower dose. Older people tended to respond less favorably.The ultimate proof of whether any vaccine works will be large-scale clinical trials that use a flip of the coin to randomly decide whether thousands of people receive the experimental vaccine or a placebo shot \u2014 and then wait to see whether the vaccinated group is protected against infection or severe disease.The immune system uses a multi-pronged approach to defeat any pathogen, and it is not yet known exactly what protects against a coronavirus infection.ADMuch public attention has focused on antibodies that block and neutralize the virus. Experimental vaccines from biotechnology company Moderna and pharmaceutical giant Pfizer have been shown to trigger antibodies at similar or greater levels than people who are naturally recovering from coronavirus infections, a benchmark that many scientists consider a hopeful sign.ADBut there are other forms of immune memory, including T cells, that are an area of increasing interest as evidence accumulates that antibody levels can drop off quickly in people naturally recovering from an infection. The Oxford and Chinese studies, like studies from Moderna and Pfizer, measured some T-cell responses.One type of T cell, helper T cells, can be compared to \u201cthe football coach, where the coach calls the play,\u201d said Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at Columbia University. \u201cThey\u2019re coordinating the immune response of all the other cells in the immune system \u2014 those are really important.\u201d The helper T cells can instruct the immune system to produce virus-fighting antibodies.There are also \u201ckiller,\u201d or cytotoxic, T cells, which are capable of destroying infected cells.\u201cIt is unclear the role that cytotoxic T cells play in amelioration of covid-19 disease,\u201d Offit said. \u201cIt is, in a sense, a second line of defense.\u201d\n\n\n\nJohnson reported from Boulder, Colo.U.S., Britain and Canada say Russian cyberspies are trying to steal coronavirus vaccine researchElegant but unproven, RNA experiments leap to the front in coronavirus vaccine race.

Now in his third year as ambassador, after serving as Russia\u2019s deputy minister of both foreign affairs and defense, his remarks echoed many of those previously made by Russian President Vladimir Putin in recent months.While he characterized conversations between Putin and President Trump, including five telephone calls in late March and April, as constructive, Antonov said that \u201cunfortunately, it is not always possible to implement in practice the constructive tone of the presidents\u2019 talks.\u201dADADU.S. critics of Trump have long accused him of kowtowing to Putin, and even some inside the administration have expressed concern that Trump has been unable or unwilling to stand up to the Russian leader.Trump and Putin are not known to have spoken since allegations of the Russian bounty program surfaced. Trump has called the reports a \u201choax.\u201dOn other issues, Antonov said that Russia, which has a veto in the U.N. Security Council,  will oppose U.S. efforts there to reimpose sanctions on Iran\u2019s sale or purchase of weapons that are to be lifted in October as part of the Iran nuclear deal.Antonov repeated Russia\u2019s contention, shared by others party to the Iran agreement, that Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw from the agreement more than two years ago \u201cmeans that the United States has not any right to trigger or to start \u2018snapback,\u2019\u00a0\u201d as the reimposition of sanctions is known.ADAD\u201cWe can\u2019t see any legal and technical ways for such a decision,\u201d he said.Antonov declined to be drawn into current U.S. domestic political tensions. \u201cOf course I am shocked. Shocked [by] what I see today in the United States,\u201d he said. But \u201cI have to be very cautious. I am the ambassador of a foreign country.\u201dMuch of his remarks focused on arms control, and particularly a meeting in Vienna last month between newly appointed U.S. special envoy Marshall S.

With a market capitalization of $224 billion, Tesla has surpassed Toyota Motor Corp. as the world\u2019s most valuable automaker.Support our journalism. Subscribe today.arrow-rightYet in the second quarter of 2020, Tesla delivered 91,000 vehicles \u2014 about 5% fewer than the same period last year. That\u2019s pretty underwhelming for a company whose fans view it as a fast-growing technology company in the mold of Amazon.com Inc., rather than a sluggish\u00a0metal-bashing carmaker. So how is the massive recent jump in its market value justified?In fairness, it shows resilience to sell\u00a0this many cars when the company\u2019s main California plant was shut by the pandemic for much of the spring period. Doubtless, Tesla\u2019s new Shanghai plant picked up the production slack, which suggests the expense and effort of getting that\u00a0China factory up and running was worth it. The launch of Tesla\u2019s new Model Y crossover vehicle will have helped. Ford Motor Co. and General Motors Co. both saw their U.S. deliveries decline by a third in the same quarter.\u00a0ADADNevertheless, Tesla\u2019s stock market\u00a0acolytes pushed the shares up another 8% on Thursday, adding $16.5 billion to the market value. Such exuberance is\u00a0hard to understand. Musk\u2019s company sold 7,650 more vehicles than analysts expected during the second quarter, and the stock price jump equates to about $2 million of added shareholder value for each of those additional sales. This seems a little excessive\u00a0given that a Tesla Model 3 sells for less than $40,000, and the profit margin\u00a0on those cars is pretty slim. \u00a0The shareholder reaction makes even less sense when you consider that Tesla investors\u00a0aren\u2019t really meant to\u00a0buying the stock because of the company\u2019s current sales, which are less than 4% of Volkswagen AG\u2019s. Rather, the investment case is a long-term one: that it will come to occupy a dominant position in clean transport and energy in the years ahead. That explains why the shares trade at 320 times its analyst-estimated earnings this year. Viewed through this lens, Tesla\u2019s ability to shift\u00a0a few thousand extra cars in recent weeks shouldn\u2019t matter\u00a0so much for the valuation.\u00a0\u00a0Investors\u2019 tendency to overreact to Tesla news\u00a0made more sense when its survival was open to doubt. A year ago it was laying off workers, U.S. sales were slowing and its retail strategy was  confused. Senior staff kept heading for the exit. The company was burning through cash and ran pretty low on financial fuel. It had just $2.2 billion of cash in March 2019, compared with more than $8 billion now.ADADBut subsequent evidence that Tesla can sell cars for more than it costs to produce them has transformed the mood \u2014 and with it Tesla\u2019s stock price.Instead of \u201ckilling\u201d off Tesla, the tepid electric offerings of established carmakers such as Audi\u00a0and Mercedes have only underscored the quality of their rival\u2019s battery and powertrain technology (the same can\u2019t be said of Tesla\u2019s build quality). Volkswagen\u2019s software problems with its forthcoming ID.3 electric vehicle suggest catching Tesla won\u2019t be straightforward, even with the Germans\u2019 vast resources.Tesla\u2019s stratospheric valuation appears to have become self-reinforcing. Should it require more money to fund its roughly $9 billion of capital expenditure\u00a0over the next three years, it can raise it from shareholders without worrying about diluting them too much.ADADSimilarly, holders of more than $4 billion of convertible bonds that Tesla issued to fund its expansion should be happy to convert them into stock, rather than demand cash repayment, taking some of the pressure off the company and its balance sheet. \u00a0Still, Tesla\u2019s valuation remains impossible to justify by\u00a0any standard metrics. Analysts\u2019 average price target is more than 40% below the current level. Even Musk has suggested that the share price, which has almost trebled since the start of 2020, is too high \u2014 although, as with his taunting of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and his comments about \u201cfascist\u201d lockdowns, it\u2019s usually better to tune out what Musk says and focus on his actions instead. \u00a0The skeptics might have more faith in Tesla\u2019s new position as\u00a0the leader of the automaker pack when Musk stops his provocations and his shareholders stop getting giddy over modest good news.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Chris Bryant is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering industrial companies.

That was before security forces attacked peaceful protesters in Lafayette Square so that Trump could stage a bizarre photo-op. Before he pushed to send the armed forces into the streets. Before he embraced \u201cwhite power\u201d and called Black Lives Matter \u201ca symbol of hate.\u201d Before he vowed to veto the defense authorization bill to prevent the renaming of military bases named after Confederate generals. Before he used the novel coronavirus as an excuse to shut down immigration and threatened to revoke the visas of college students unable to attend classes in the fall. Before he ignored reports that a Russian intelligence unit had placed a bounty on U.S. soldiers in Afghanistan. Before he moved to pull out of the World Health Organization during the worst pandemic in a century. Before he held rallies that most likely helped to spread the disease. Before he falsely accused MSNBC host and Post columnist Joe Scarborough of murdering a staff member. Before former national security adviser John Bolton revealed that Trump praised China\u2019s prison camps for Uighurs and asked Chinese leader Xi Jinping to help him win reelection.Most of all, that was before the coronavirus had infected more than 3.1 million Americans and claimed the lives of more than 131,000. The pandemic was already a disaster on April 5, but back then we still had \u201conly\u201d 331,000 cases and 9,400 deaths. On April 5, some 25,000 new cases were reported. More than twice as many were recorded on Friday, when daily new coronavirus cases climbed to a record-breaking 63,900. In early April it was still possible to imagine that the virus really would abate by the middle of summer. That this hasn\u2019t happened \u2014 that the virus is still raging out of control in America while being brought under control in so many other countries \u2014 is directly attributable to the epic failure of leadership by a president who infamously proclaimed \u201cI don\u2019t take responsibility at all.\u201dADADBut what makes Trump the worst president ever is not simply that he is colossally incompetent. It is that he is also thoroughly corrupt. It is hard to think of a single major decision he has made for the good of the country, rather than for his own advantage. Trump has so egregiously abused the power of the presidency that he makes Warren Harding and Richard Nixon look like choirboys. Trump was impeached for trying to use military aid to blackmail Ukraine into helping his reelection campaign. He seems to have learned nothing from the experience save that, with Republicans in control of the Senate, he can get away with anything. Since his acquittal, he has committed one appalling act of corruption after another.Trump has purged anyone who dared to testify against him. The most recent victim was Army Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, a decorated combat veteran who was forced to retire while being belittled by a callow White House press secretary as a \u201cformer junior employee.\u201d Also gone are the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York and numerous inspectors general who dared to investigate Trump and his cronies. At the same time, Attorney General William P. Barr has launched a politically motivated probe of the investigators who had looked into the Trump campaign\u2019s copious ties to Russia. FBI agents have already been hounded into retirement and slandered by the president. They may yet face prosecution.While seeking vengeance against those who spoke the truth about his ugly machinations, Trump has sought to reward those who broke the law on his behalf. Barr wants to drop charges to which former national security adviser Michael Flynn already pleaded guilty \u2014 a move that a retired federal judge described as \u201cclear evidence of gross prosecutorial abuse.\u201d Barr also sought a reduced sentence for Stone, even while conceding that his \u201cprosecution was righteous,\u201d before Trump on Friday simply set Stone free.ADADStone served as the liaison between the Trump campaign and WikiLeaks, the website that Russian intelligence used to release stolen Democratic Party emails to help Trump win the presidency. Stone refused to testify about what he knew; he perjured himself and obstructed justice to protect the president. And now Trump has rewarded him for his silence. The quid pro quo is blindingly obvious. Not even Nixon during Watergate dared to pardon his co-conspirators or commute their sentences. That Trump has done so secures his unrivaled place in the annals of presidential infamy.He is not just the worst president ever; he keeps getting worse.Read more:Ruth Marcus: Trump\u2019s self-serving help for Roger StoneHoward Fineman: Roger Stone is savedThe Post\u2019s View: Trump\u2019s commutation of Roger Stone\u2019s sentence is an unforgivable betrayal of his officeRadley Balko: The Roger Stone case highlights our pernicious system of tiered justiceSeth Cousins: I was a juror in the Roger Stone trial.

How is this virus different?Unlike the coronavirus responsible for the 2002-2003 outbreak in Asia of severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, this new one can spread via people who are infected but haven\u2019t yet developed or won\u2019t develop symptoms. Researchers at the University of Oxford estimated in March that a third to half of transmissions occur from pre-symptomatic people. What\u2019s more, the new virus has a relatively long incubation incubation period -- the time between infection and the appearance of symptoms -- enabling it to move silently in a community before being detected. The interval is about five days for the coronavirus, compared with two days for the flu, which spreads the same way and is the most common cause of pandemics. The stealthy nature of the coronavirus wasn\u2019t well understood at first and contributed to the staggered and uneven quality of the response.ADADRead more: Why \u2018Silent Spreaders\u2019 Make Coronavirus Hard to Beat: QuickTake2. Why wasn\u2019t it contained?On Jan. 23, China imposed the most extensive quarantine in known history in Hubei province, where the outbreak began in the capital Wuhan, an industrial city of 11 million. By then, however, the virus had been seeded in other places in China and abroad. Starting in early February, travel bans were introduced between countries, but not before the virus had reached around the world. Governments locked down populations through stay-at-home orders and mandated \u201csocial distancing\u201d to \u201cflatten the curve\u201d of new infections, but the economic toll propelled reopenings that in some cases brought a surge in cases. It took months for some governments to recommend or mandate that people wear face masks in tight public spaces to counter the virus\u2019s silent spread.ADADRead more: Mask or No Mask? And Which Kind? What the Experts Say: QuickTakeRead more: Who\u2019s Succeeding Against the Coronavirus and Why: QuickTake3. What\u2019s the biggest mystery about the virus?A major question affecting how social-distancing protocols could be safely eased and people could feel more secure about returning to public spaces is whether those who get the coronavirus emerge with immunity to it. Generally speaking, infections prompt the body to develop antibodies that protect against reinfection, although there are notable exceptions, such as HIV and malaria. By mid-year a slew of test kits to detect antibodies to the coronavirus were available, including some that could be ordered online for taking at home. Many tests, however, weren\u2019t reliable. What\u2019s more, researchers still don\u2019t know whether the presence of antibodies means someone has immunity, or how long that protection might last. Concerns that infections might recur have been stoked by a small number of people testing positive for the virus sometimes weeks after their symptoms ended.ADADRead more: The Two Kinds of Virus Tests That Can Save Us. Or Not: QuickTake4. What are the other unanswered questions?\u2022 How deadly is it: Calculating the fatality rate in the midst of an outbreak is difficult because many cases go uncounted. Also, countries have different criteria for what deaths they include in their Covid-19 tallies. By mid-year, studies tended to converge on rates ranging from 0.5% to 1%. The higher figure would make Covid-19 10 times more lethal than seasonal flu, though the risk of dying varies greatly by age and is vastly higher for those with underlying illnesses. Apart from the scourge of HIV, which has stretched over four decades, this is poised to become the deadliest pandemic since the 1918 influenza that infected approximately a third of the world\u2019s population, killing an estimated 50 million people.ADAD\u2022 Is it seasonal?: In temperate climates, seasonal flu tends to flare in winter and recede as spring arrives. That gave rise to hopes that the arrival of warmer weather in the Northern Hemisphere would keep Covid-19 in check there. Some early evidence suggests higher temperatures slowed transmission of the coronavirus \u2014 but the effect was a modest one. Plus, a decline in summer could mean a surge in fall, as it does for flu.Read more: Does Warm Weather Curb Coronavirus? What Experts Say: QuickTake\u2022 What are all the ways it spreads?: It\u2019s clear people contract the coronavirus by coming into contact with virus-containing droplets emitted when an infected person coughs, sneezes, talks or just exhales normally, as with flu. The main risk is encountering these droplets directly from someone in close proximity. It\u2019s also possible to become infected by touching a contaminated surface and then the mouth, nose or eyes. One study concluded that the coronavirus can survive four hours on copper, 24 hours on cardboard, 48 hours on stainless steel and 72 hours on plastic. Researchers continue to investigate the theoretical risk that the coronavirus can spread through feces or in tiny airborne particles known as aerosols.ADADRead more: How Do People Catch the Coronavirus? What Experts Say: QuickTake\u2022 What circumstances are dangerous?: Evidence increasingly suggests that most people contract the virus via exposure to an infected person in an enclosed space for longer than a few moments. Spread of the virus in an outdoor environment appears to be relatively uncommon. Researchers have begun to conclude that so-called super-spreading events play an outsized role in the pandemic. These are episodes in which a single individual infects a cluster of people, for instance at a bar, a funeral or a choir practice.Read more: How Safe Is Flying in the Age of Coronavirus: QuickTakeAD\u2022 Where it came from: When the virus first emerged in early December in Wuhan, attention focused on a market where live animals were butchered and sold. Early cases not tied to the market suggest it wasn\u2019t where the virus originated but probably where it subsequently spread. The viral genome is closely related to several coronaviruses found in bats. Diseases transmissible from animals to humans, sometimes referred to as zoonoses, comprise a large percentage of all newly identified infectious diseases. U.S. and Chinese officials have traded accusations, though without evidence, that the other is responsible for releasing the virus.AD5. What have we learned about the virus?About 80% of cases have mild or no symptoms, 15% are severe and require oxygen, and 5% are critical, requiring ventilation, according to the World Health Organization. The elderly and those with underlying health issues, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, cardiovascular disease and obesity, are most at risk of developing a life-threatening illness. In the limited studies done by mid-year, those 65 and older have accounted for about 80% of deaths. The earliest recognized symptoms of Covid-19 were fever, dry cough and tiredness. Over time, the WHO added less common manifestations: aches and pains, nasal congestion, headache, conjunctivitis, sore throat, diarrhea, loss of taste or smell, a skin rash or discoloration of fingers or toes. Complications include failure of the respiratory and other vital systems, septic shock and blood-clotting disorders.ADWhat\u2019s next?ADThere are a few things to watch for:\u2022 New epicenters: Six months into the crisis, new cases were declining in most countries, yet still mostly rising in Latin America\u2019s largest economies.\u2022 A second wave: After restrictions in most places began to be lifted in May, authorities were on high alert for spikes, clusters of outbreaks or a full second wave. In the face of surging cases in early summer, some U.S. states began suspending or reversing reopenings to try to prevent swamped health systems.Read more: Why the World Worries About a Covid-19 \u2018Second Wave\u2019: QuickTake\u2022 Herd immunity: If prior illness provides protection against reinfection, once a sufficient percentage of people in a community catch it, so-called herd immunity can become established. That reduces the number of susceptible people to a level at which transmission slows and eventually stops. The same effect can be achieved through vaccination. The necessary percentage depends on the contagiousness of the pathogen. For the novel coronavirus, it\u2019s estimated to range from 55% to 82%. In the U.K. as of June, an estimated 5% of people had coronavirus antibodies. The figure was measured in May at 17% in London and 22.7% in New York City.ADAD\u2022 Better treatments: In late April, U.S. researchers announced that remdesivir, an experimental drug made by Gilead Sciences Inc., helped patients recover from Covid-19 more quickly than standard care. In June, the low-cost, anti-inflammatory dexamethasone improved survival in patients with Covid-19 in a study, becoming the first treatment to show life-saving promise. The search for additional treatments continues, with more than 100 under investigation.Read more: Where Are We in the Quest for Coronavirus Drugs: QuickTake\u2022 Vaccines: More than 130 experimental ones against the coronavirus are in development.

Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), also threw a curveball yesterday when they released an updated version. The new version reduces the chances for a nationwide requirement forcing companies to create encryption backdoors for law enforcement. But it raises the chances laws with those requirements could be passed at the state level \u2013 which opponents say is just as bad.ADAD\u201cThis new bill doesn\u2019t fix the encryption concerns, it just shifts them to a different place,\u201d Neema Singh Guliani, senior legislative counsel at the American Civil Liberties Union, told me.\u00a0The Internet Association, which includes Google, Microsoft and Amazon among its members, charged that the new version \u201creplaces one set of problems with another by opening the door to an unpredictable and inconsistent set of standards under state laws.\u201d (Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos owns the Washington Post.)\u00a0Judiciary Committee members could vote to forward the old version of the bill, the new version or none to be considered by the full Senate.\u00a0The bill has become a lightning rod in a government push against encryption.Attorney General Bill Barr has revved up his campaign to convince lawmakers that strong encryption helps criminals and terrorists evade law enforcement. The new bill also comes amid a backlash over privacy issues that\u2019s made many lawmakers far less sympathetic to tech companies and the cybersecurity advocates who are taking their side in this case.\u00a0ADAD\u201cSaying we need to [change] technology so it can\u2019t be used for evil is a fool\u2019s errand,\u201d said Sascha Meinrath, a Penn State professor and\u00a0founding director of the X-Lab think tank focused on the intersection of technologies and public policy. \u201cBut convincing people that there are risks we have to accept as a society because of the beneficial uses of technology is very difficult.\u201d\u00a0There's stark division in Congress over encryption.\u00a0Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) plans to push for an amendment during today\u2019s committee debate that would effectively bar state or federal officials from undermining encryption when they implement the bill. \u00a0ADSen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore), a longtime encryption advocate, charged the updated bill \u201cwill do even less than the previous version to stop the spread of\u00a0child sexual abuse materials\u201d and \u201ccreate massive uncertainty, both for strong encryption and free speech online.\u201d Wyden and several other senators are sponsoring a separate bill that would invest $5 billion in combating online child sexual exploitation but not weaken encryption.\u00a0Graham, meanwhile, is also sponsoring a separate bill called the Lawful Access to Encrypted Data Act that would completely block companies from using encryption if it prevents law enforcement with a warrant from accessing users\u2019 data and communications.\u00a0The updated version of EARN IT would effectively shift the encryption fight from the federal to the state level. \u00a0The first version created a commission tasked with writing rules for how companies could best protect against users sharing child pornography. It would have retained liability protections for companies that followed those rules but imposed severe civil and criminal liability on companies that didn\u2019t. The standard for culpability was relatively low: Companies could be punished for being \u201creckless\u201d about not stopping the sharing. And the courts could consider the use of strong encryption that blocked companies from seeing that their users were sharing illegal content to fit this criteria.\u00a0ADADThe new version simply removes the liability protections in all instances where users share child pornography. But it only includes federal penalties if the companies know specific users are sharing the material and don\u2019t do anything about it. At the state level, however, it opens the door for far more stringent standards, which could include criminalizing companies using encryption.\u00a0The potential loss of liability protections for content posted on tech platforms would be a significant deterrent to keeping or adopting strong encryption that keeps all users safe from data theft and cyberattacks. And the challenges could be even tougher if companies are forced to comply with a patchwork of different liability standards across 50 states.\u00a0Free speech advocates fear the bill will push tech companies to clamp down on content far beyond child pornography.\u00a0They point to a 2018 law, nicknamed FOSTA, that rolled back tech companies\u2019 liability protections for content related to sex trafficking. The law successfully shut down major sex trafficking sites. But critics say it also made tech companies so fearful of legal consequences they removed large amounts of content that wasn\u2019t actual sex trafficking \u2013 including content aimed at helping keep sex workers safe from exploitation and harassment. \u00a0\u00a0ADADEARN IT critics fear the new version of the bill could lead companies to similarly remove unrelated content, such as sex education materials or message boards aimed at helping LGBTQ youth.\u00a0\u201cSeparate and apart from undermining encryption, this raises broad speech concerns in a way that\u2019s unacceptable,\u201d ACLU Senior Legislative Counsel Kate Ruane told me.\u00a0Programming note: The Cybersecurity 202 newsletter is off tomorrow.

Subscribe today.arrow-rightSponsors of the bipartisan EARN IT Act say their bill will force tech companies to get tough about combating child pornography by stripping them of liability protections when users share the material on their platforms. But critics fear provisions in the bill could force those companies to abandon strong encryption protections that keep all their users secure against hacking.\u00a0The bill\u2019s sponsors, Senate Judiciary Chairman Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) and Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), also threw a curveball yesterday when they released an updated version. The new version reduces the chances for a nationwide requirement forcing companies to create encryption backdoors for law enforcement. But it raises the chances laws with those requirements could be passed at the state level \u2013 which opponents say is just as bad.ADAD\u201cThis new bill doesn\u2019t fix the encryption concerns, it just shifts them to a different place,\u201d Neema Singh Guliani, senior legislative counsel at the American Civil Liberties Union, told me.\u00a0The Internet Association, which includes Google, Microsoft and Amazon among its members, charged that the new version \u201creplaces one set of problems with another by opening the door to an unpredictable and inconsistent set of standards under state laws.\u201d (Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos owns the Washington Post.)\u00a0Judiciary Committee members could vote to forward the old version of the bill, the new version or none to be considered by the full Senate.\u00a0The bill has become a lightning rod in a government push against encryption.Attorney General Bill Barr has revved up his campaign to convince lawmakers that strong encryption helps criminals and terrorists evade law enforcement. The new bill also comes amid a backlash over privacy issues that\u2019s made many lawmakers far less sympathetic to tech companies and the cybersecurity advocates who are taking their side in this case.\u00a0ADAD\u201cSaying we need to [change] technology so it can\u2019t be used for evil is a fool\u2019s errand,\u201d said Sascha Meinrath, a Penn State professor and\u00a0founding director of the X-Lab think tank focused on the intersection of technologies and public policy. \u201cBut convincing people that there are risks we have to accept as a society because of the beneficial uses of technology is very difficult.\u201d\u00a0There's stark division in Congress over encryption.\u00a0Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) plans to push for an amendment during today\u2019s committee debate that would effectively bar state or federal officials from undermining encryption when they implement the bill. \u00a0ADSen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore), a longtime encryption advocate, charged the updated bill \u201cwill do even less than the previous version to stop the spread of\u00a0child sexual abuse materials\u201d and \u201ccreate massive uncertainty, both for strong encryption and free speech online.\u201d Wyden and several other senators are sponsoring a separate bill that would invest $5 billion in combating online child sexual exploitation but not weaken encryption.\u00a0Graham, meanwhile, is also sponsoring a separate bill called the Lawful Access to Encrypted Data Act that would completely block companies from using encryption if it prevents law enforcement with a warrant from accessing users\u2019 data and communications.\u00a0The updated version of EARN IT would effectively shift the encryption fight from the federal to the state level. \u00a0The first version created a commission tasked with writing rules for how companies could best protect against users sharing child pornography. It would have retained liability protections for companies that followed those rules but imposed severe civil and criminal liability on companies that didn\u2019t. The standard for culpability was relatively low: Companies could be punished for being \u201creckless\u201d about not stopping the sharing. And the courts could consider the use of strong encryption that blocked companies from seeing that their users were sharing illegal content to fit this criteria.\u00a0ADADThe new version simply removes the liability protections in all instances where users share child pornography. But it only includes federal penalties if the companies know specific users are sharing the material and don\u2019t do anything about it. At the state level, however, it opens the door for far more stringent standards, which could include criminalizing companies using encryption.\u00a0The potential loss of liability protections for content posted on tech platforms would be a significant deterrent to keeping or adopting strong encryption that keeps all users safe from data theft and cyberattacks. And the challenges could be even tougher if companies are forced to comply with a patchwork of different liability standards across 50 states.\u00a0Free speech advocates fear the bill will push tech companies to clamp down on content far beyond child pornography.\u00a0They point to a 2018 law, nicknamed FOSTA, that rolled back tech companies\u2019 liability protections for content related to sex trafficking. The law successfully shut down major sex trafficking sites. But critics say it also made tech companies so fearful of legal consequences they removed large amounts of content that wasn\u2019t actual sex trafficking \u2013 including content aimed at helping keep sex workers safe from exploitation and harassment. \u00a0\u00a0ADADEARN IT critics fear the new version of the bill could lead companies to similarly remove unrelated content, such as sex education materials or message boards aimed at helping LGBTQ youth.\u00a0\u201cSeparate and apart from undermining encryption, this raises broad speech concerns in a way that\u2019s unacceptable,\u201d ACLU Senior Legislative Counsel Kate Ruane told me.\u00a0Programming note: The Cybersecurity 202 newsletter is off tomorrow.

He wants schools to be fully open in the fall. He wants a Republican convention next month to be as normal as possible. So far, the public isn\u2019t buying.The president has the bully pulpit but the public is looking at what\u2019s happening around them.\u00a0About half of states are recording increases in the number of cases of covid-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. In some places, the increases have been dramatic. State and local leaders have been forced to reverse course on previous efforts to reopen businesses.Attitudes are shifting almost as dramatically as the spread of the disease.\u00a0Recent Gallup polling, reported by the organization\u2019s Jeffrey M. Jones, tells the story. More people now say the situation with the virus is getting worse than at any time during the pandemic and expectations about how long the disruption might last are shifting as well. The changes are not at the margins.ADADIn early June, 47 percent said the virus situation was getting a little or a lot better, while 30 percent said it was getting a little or a lot worse. (The rest said it was staying the same.) By the end of June, the numbers had flipped, with 23 percent saying the situation was a little or a lot better and 65 percent saying it was a little or a lot worse. In a month, there was a 35-point spike in the percentage of people saying things were getting worse.The previous high point of those saying things were getting worse was in early April, when 56 percent said that. Through most of the spring and early summer, the percentage saying things were getting worse hovered around 42 percent.As the disease spreads, Americans are recalibrating their expectations about the future. In the late June survey, 74 percent said they now expect disruption of their lives due to the disease to last until the end of this year or longer. That group is split evenly between those who expect things to return closer to normal by year\u2019s end and those who say it will be at least sometime in 2021 before that happens.ADADIn early June, 54 percent said they thought the disruptions would last to the end of the year or beyond. That means during the month of June, there was a 20-point jump in the direction of pessimism about the lasting effects of the pandemic.As with all such polling, there are significant partisan differences in the way people see things.While 90 percent of Democrats said things are getting worse, just 28 percent of Republicans held that view. Among independents, 63 percent said the situation is getting worse.But the trendlines all moved in unison toward more concern. In the week between June 21 and June 28, there was a 15-point rise among Democrats, an 18-point jump among independents and an 8-point increase among Republicans.ADMore people are worried about getting covid-19. Currently, 56 percent say they are worried, which is just 1 point below the peak of concern back in April and a rise of 9 points since early June.People are more cautious about going out in public. In one week, the percentage who said even healthy people with no symptoms should stay at home as much as possible rose 6 points, from 66 percent to 72 percent. That compares with 28 percent who said that healthy people should try to lead their lives as normally as possible.Trump\u2019s latest initiative is to encourage schools to open up this fall.\u00a0He pressed the idea on Tuesday and on Wednesday morning tweeted his displeasure with the guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, calling them \u201cvery tough and expensive.\u201d He said the CDC was asking schools to do \u201cvery impractical things,\u201d adding, \u201cI will be meeting with them!!!\u201d A few hours later, Vice President Pence said the CDC will soon reissue school guidance. Yet on Thursday morning, CDC Director Robert Redfield said on ABC's \u201cGood Morning America\u201d that the guidelines won't be revised, but \u201cwe are going to provide additional reference documents.\u201dADADThat continues a pattern of the president disagreeing with the scientists and institutions tasked with public health and attempting to jawbone them into taking a different position. But there is now a track record of what can happen when states and cities ignore guidelines.Some of the states that moved fastest to reopen their economies \u2014 \u00a0in many cases paying minimal attention to the government\u2019s guidelines on when and how to reopen \u2014 \u00a0have since seen enormous increases in coronavirus cases. Among them are Texas, Arizona and Florida.The issue of school reopening is enormously difficult. School administrators are weighing the health risks to students, their families and their communities of fully returning to schools this fall against the long-term damage to young people who could fall behind academically and in their social development if they are not back in the classroom. That is especially the case for elementary and secondary students without access to fast Internet, good computers and parents who can spend time helping with remote learning.ADADColleges and universities are weighing the same issues, as well as the economic costs to their institutions of lost tuition money if they aren\u2019t providing a learning environment attractive to students. On a cautionary note, there is some evidence there are clear risks of having thousands of young people gathered on campuses, studying and partying as they are likely to do.Trump prefers to be a cheerleader, painting rhetorically with a broad brush that pushes aside the complications that come with all these decisions. The reason is obvious. He wants to return to the pre-pandemic America, a country with a vibrant economy, which he sought as the foundation of his reelection campaign.Instead, reality continues to get in his way. Trump can say what he does, but people are drawing their own conclusions \u2014 about the state of the coronavirus crisis, the risks they face personally and how to continually adjust their behavior.ADADUntil the spread begins to decline widely, most Americans are likely to be cautious. They will not be looking to the president to make that judgment for them.Quote of the day\u201cA lot people thought once the alarm was sounded back in March surely the federal government would fix this, but that hasn\u2019t happened,\u201d said Deborah Burger, a California nurse and the president of National Nurses United. (William Wan)\u00a0More on the coronavirusHospitals across the Sun Belt are strained.\u00a0\u201cIn pandemic hotspot states such as Florida, Arizona, California and Texas, hospitals are adding new intensive care unit beds and special air-flow systems to treat the growing demand as virus hospitalizations set records almost daily. To cope with the wave of patients, hospitals are canceling elective surgeries to free up space for those sick with the virus. Medical staff warn they could become overwhelmed,\u201d Chelsea Janes, Isaac Stanley-Becker, Lenny Bernstein and Joshua Partlow report. \u201cThe United States passed the 3 million case mark on Wednesday, and more than 129,000 people have died. Florida is rushing some 100 new health-care workers to \u00adMiami-Dade County\u2019s public hospital network to handle the influx of coronavirus cases, including 75 nurses who will be ready to work in intensive care units. \u2026 Texas on Wednesday reported 98 deaths from covid-19, a one-day high that surpassed its earlier record reached on Tuesday, when Arizona and Mississippi also reached one-day highs. Arizona and Texas also hit new highs this week in seven-day rolling averages of deaths. \u2026 About 45 percent of the Texas Medical Center\u2019s 1,364 intensive care unit beds are now filled with coronavirus patients. \u2026 Hospitals are also feeling the strain in Los Angeles County, which is averaging around 2,300 new cases each day.\"The country is running short on masks, gowns and gloves. Again.\u00a0\u201cNurses say they are reusing N95 masks for days and even weeks at a time. Doctors say they can\u2019t reopen offices because they lack personal protective equipment. State officials say they have scoured U.S. and international suppliers for PPE and struggle to get orders filled. Experts worry the problem could worsen as coronavirus infections climb, straining medical systems,\u201d William Wan reports. \u201cIn interviews, White House officials said concerns over PPE shortages are overblown. They said U.S. manufacturing and stockpiles of protective equipment have improved dramatically and are adequate in most states. \u2026 Demand for protective equipment has soared, but unlike in March, when efforts focused on getting PPE for major hospitals \u2026 supplies now are desperately needed by primary care offices, nursing homes, prisons and psychiatric and disability facilities.\u201dTrump\u2019s Tulsa rally is \u201clikely\u201d the source of a virus surge.Tulsa City-County Health Department Director Bruce Dart said the rally \u201clikely contributed\u201d to a dramatic surge in new cases, the AP reports. \u201cTulsa County reported 261 confirmed new cases on Monday, a one-day record high, and another 206 cases on Tuesday. By comparison, during the week before the June 20 Trump rally, there were 76 cases on Monday and 96 on Tuesday. Although the health department\u2019s policy is to not publicly identify individual settings where people may have contracted the virus, Dart said those large gatherings \u2018more than likely\u2019 contributed to the spike.\u201d\u00a0ADADA rapidly growing number of Houston-area residents are dying at home, according to an NBC News and ProPublica investigation. A growing number of these at-home deaths have been linked to covid-19.A Texas GOP convention originally scheduled to be held next week in Houston has been canceled,\u00a0Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner (D) said. \"These are some very serious times,\" Turner said. \"Simply, the public health concerns outweighed anything else.\" (Texas Tribune)But, but, but: Trump is heading to Odessa, Tex., later this month for a fundraiser.\u00a0The invite to the event, shared by the Tribune\u2019s Patrick Svitek, doesn\u2019t specify where in the city the fundraiser will be held, but tickets range from $2,800 to $100,000.Disney World will reopen on Saturday, despite Florida\u2019s worsening outbreak.

(Dana Hedgpeth, Julie Zauzmer and Erin Cox)Trump wants schools to reopen. But school officials are pushing against it.\u00a0School officials across the country have concluded they cannot fully reopen while following new CDC guidance that recommends that students be kept six feet apart to prevent spreading the virus, because classrooms are too small to accommodate all students with the recommended distancing, Laura Meckler reports. \u201cThe administration is finding it nearly impossible to control the situation, with the president\u2019s views often at odds with those of his health advisers \u2026 On Wednesday, New York City schools, the nation\u2019s largest school system, announced a plan that will have most students in school two days a week and learning from home the other three. Many other systems have announced or are considering similar plans. \u2026. Trump \u2026 ended with a nebulous threat: \u2018May cut off funding if not open!\u2019 Trump has no power to cut federal funding already allocated to states and districts, but the vice president suggested the administration would seek to tie any future aid to opening of schools.\"Harvard and MIT sued the Trump administration to protect international students.\u00a0\u201cThe\u00a0lawsuit\u00a0represented a swift response to\u00a0an unexpected order issued this week by the federal government, as universities rush to protect the status of thousands of international students. It also marks a new battle line in the war between Trump and education leaders over how to safely reopen schools in the midst of his reelection bid,\u201d Susan Svrluga and Nick Anderson report. \u201cIn their lawsuit, the universities argue that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement\u2019s decision was designed to force universities to conduct in-person classes, part of an apparent political strategy from the Trump administration to pressure schools, from kindergarten to graduate school, to fully reopen this fall, even as virus cases soar. \u2026 The lawsuit cites remarks from acting deputy secretary of homeland security Ken Cuccinelli on Tuesday, in which he said the directive \u2018will \u2026 encourage schools to reopen.\u2019\u201d\u00a0Retail workers are caught in the latest culture war: Getting customers to wear face masks.\u00a0\u201cMixed messaging and politicization have turned a public health safeguard into a lightning-rod issue. As a result, workers have been berated, even assaulted, by aggressive anti-maskers,\u201d Abha Bhattarai reports. \u201cSome workers say they have been told they cannot refuse service to maskless customers, even if local laws require it. Others feel they\u2019ve been put in the awkward and sometimes dangerous position of confronting shoppers who refuse to wear the coverings. In recent weeks, retail workers have been punched in the face, suffered broken limbs and, in the case of\u00a0a security guard at a Family Dollar\u00a0store in Michigan, killed while trying to enforce mask requirements.\u201d\u00a0ADADThe head of the TSA ordered new covid-19 safety precautions after meeting with a whistleblower who said the agency wasn\u2019t doing enough.\u00a0\u201cThe new measures require officers to wear eye protection when they are in close contact with travelers and aren\u2019t protected by a plastic screen, the attorney said. Officers must also change their gloves or sanitize them after patting down passengers, handling identification documents or checking in luggage,\u201d Ian Duncan reports. \u00a0United Airlines warned that it may furlough 36,000 of its employees, almost half of its U.S. workforce. (WSJ)On some planes, some rows are kept empty even as passengers are crowded together.\u00a0On an American Airlines flight, \u201cJoy Gonzalez, an aviation engineer based in Seattle, found herself seated at a window with two older passengers beside her in the middle and aisle seats. In order to gain more social distance, she and the aisle passenger both moved to seats behind them where two rows were empty. But before takeoff, a flight attendant ordered them back to their assigned seats, telling them they had not paid for those exit row seats, which are more expensive,\u201d the Times reports. \u201cAirlines vowed to bring social distancing to the air \u2026 by reducing capacity and blocking many middle seats. Now as air travel builds, freeing up that kind of space is plainly at odds with the airlines\u2019 profit motive, and passengers are finding they may be confined to a cramped seat if they don\u2019t pay for a premium one.\u201d\u00a0ADThings you can no longer do in Japan's theme parks: scream.\u00a0\u201cPlease scream inside your heart,\u201d said two theme park executives in an informational video shown to guests in Japan, the WSJ reports. \u201cFrom Fujiyama to Tokyo DisneySea\u2019s Tower of Terror, Japan\u2019s campaign against the coronavirus is targeting thrill-seekers who might expel a burst of virus-carrying droplets with a mid-ride utterance.

Americans for Tax Reform Foundation, led by firebrand anti-tax advocate Grover Norquist, took a loan between $150,000 and $350,000 from the Paycheck Protection Program. The Ayn Rand Institute and Citizens against Government Waste likewise accepted loans funded by the program,\u201d Tom Hamburger, Aaron Gregg and Anu Narayanswamy report. \u201cAmericans for Tax Reform Foundation is one of two related tax revision groups led by Norquist, who famously said: \u2018I don\u2019t want to abolish government. I simply want to reduce it to the size where I can drag it into the bathroom and drown it in the bathtub.\u2019\u201dAlmost one-third of U.S. households missed their July housing payments.\u00a0Thirty-two percent of households haven\u2019t made their full July payments yet, CNBC reports. That makes July the fourth month in a row that a \u201chistorically high\u201d number of households were unable to pay their housing bill on time and in full, up from 30 percent in June.\u00a0The Trump presidencyThe Supreme Court said employers can opt out of Obamacare\u2019s birth control mandate over religious objections.\u201cThe decision greatly expands the ability of employers to claim the exception, and the government estimates that between 70,000 and 126,000 women could lose access to cost-free birth control as a result,\u201d Robert Barnes reports. \u201cThe contraceptive case involves a long-running dispute over Obamacare, as the ACA is known, and a requirement that employers provide cost-free birth control for female employees. The law itself doesn\u2019t specify the rules, leaving it to federal agencies to determine how contraceptives fit into the mandate for cost-free \u2018preventive care and screenings.\u2019 The Obama administration required contraceptives and had narrower exceptions for churches and other houses of worship. \u2026 The Trump administration moved in 2018 to expand the types of organizations that could opt out to include religious groups and nonreligious employers with moral and religious objections. \u2026\u00a0\u201cThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the 3rd Circuit had put the Trump administration exemptions on hold, and said the agencies didn\u2019t have the broad authority to grant them. Justice Clarence Thomas, who wrote the majority opinion, said that was wrong. \u2026 Liberal Justices Elena Kagan and Stephen G. Breyer agreed with the court\u2019s conservatives that the administration had the right to create an exemption, but they said lower courts should examine whether the administration\u2019s rules were \u2018consistent with reasoned judgment.\u2019 Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg issued a blistering dissent, in which she said her colleagues had gone too far to appease religious conservatives.\u201dThe Court also gave religious organizations the ability to hire and fire without offending some anti-discrimination laws.\u201cIn a 7-to-2 decision, the court strengthened the \u2018ministerial exception\u2019 it found in 2012 that protects religious organizations from some employment lawsuits. It said two teachers at parochial schools who wanted to contest their firings in court were the kinds of employees who were covered by the exception and thus unable to sue. It indicated that those involved in almost any kind of religious instruction would be considered \u2018ministers\u2019 of the faith, no matter their official title or even if they practiced the faith themselves,\u201d Robert Barnes reports. \u201cJustices Sonia Sotomayor and Ginsburg dissented, saying the decision gave religious employers \u2018free rein to discriminate.\u2019 \u2026 Breyer and Kagan, usually part of the court\u2019s liberal bloc, voted with the majority.\u201dThe Supreme Court\u2019s decisions will conclude today with what could be a blockbuster decision on whether Trump may shield his private financial records and tax returns from congressional committees and a New York prosecutor.As the economy reels from the pandemic, Trump and Mexico\u2019s L\u00f3pez Obrador mark the start of a trade pact.\u00a0\u201cTrump marked the start of a three-nation regional trade deal in a Rose Garden ceremony with Mexican President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador,\u201d David Nakamura and David Lynch report. \u201cThe two populist-leaning presidents, from opposite ends of the political spectrum, signed a joint proclamation hailing the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement \u2026 Trump thanked his counterpart for responding to U.S. pressure to help curb a major spike in unauthorized immigration last year \u2026 L\u00f3pez Obrador responded that Trump has \u2018honored our position as an independent nation\u2019 and \u2018behaved with kindness and respect.\u2019 The positive comments from the two leaders on Wednesday were striking when compared with the tensions between the neighboring countries in recent years.\"The Russian ambassador said reports of a bounty program to kill U.S. soldiers are a \u201cdownright lie.\u201d\u201c\u2018No concrete evidence has been presented\u2019 of allegations that a Russian military intelligence unit offered to pay Taliban-linked militants to target American and other coalition forces, Anatoly Antonov said. Authors of the reports are \u2018trying to create an impression that our country is an enemy of the United States,\u2019\u201d Karen DeYoung reports. \u201cBut beyond Afghanistan, he said, overall U.S.-Russia relations are in a \u2018deplorable state,\u2019 which he attributed largely to U.S. withdrawal from multilateral arms control treaties and refusal to extend or seriously renegotiate the bilateral New START nuclear arms reduction treaty that expires in February. \u2026 While he characterized conversations between Putin and Trump, including five telephone calls in late March and April, as constructive, Antonov said that \u2018unfortunately, it is not always possible to implement in practice the constructive tone of the presidents\u2019 talks.\u2019\u201dThe FBI is investigating exiled Chinese businessman Guo Wengui, including his work with Steve Bannon.\u201cFBI national security agents in recent months have asked people who know both men for information on Mr. Guo\u2019s activities, including the source of funds of a media company linked to him that hired Mr. Bannon in 2018 as a consultant, the people said,\u201d the WSJ reports. \u201cThe probe has been under way for more than six months, and prosecutors from the U.S. Attorney\u2019s offices in Manhattan and Brooklyn have been involved, some of the people said. The purpose of the FBI\u2019s interests couldn\u2019t be determined. \u2026 Mr. Guo, a former property tycoon in China, in 2014 fled the country, where he is accused of wrongdoing including bribery, fraud, money laundering, kidnapping and rape\u2014allegations he has denied. He also has applied for asylum in the U.S.\u201dFacebook closed a network of accounts and pages affiliated with Roger Stone.\u201cFacebook took down a network of more than 100 pages and accounts on Wednesday it said was affiliated with felon and former Republican operative Roger Stone for \u2018coordinated inauthentic behavior,\u2019 taking the company\u2019s campaign against disinformation closer to the heart of the nation\u2019s political establishment,\u201d Craig Timberg and Isaac Stanley-Becker report. \u201cThe offending activity on Facebook and its subsidiary Instagram dated as far back as 2015 but was particularly active during the 2016 presidential election season, when Stone was advising Trump\u2019s presidential campaign, and in 2017, as federal investigators were scrutinizing his activities.\u201dDivided AmericaGeorge Floyd told police that he thought he would die because he couldn\u2019t breathe.\u00a0\u201cFloyd repeatedly begged police officers not to shoot him and complained of being claustrophobic as they tried to place him in a squad car in the minutes before he was killed on a South Minneapolis street corner in May, according to transcripts of police body camera footage from the scene released Wednesday,\u201d Holly Bailey reports. \u201cThe transcripts make clear that Floyd was trying to cooperate with police but was deathly afraid of them, at times telling them that he had had covid-19 and was worried that he was going to die because he couldn\u2019t breathe while in their custody. As one of the officers \u2014 Derek Chauvin \u2014 pressed a knee into his neck and held Floyd on the ground, he told Floyd that he must be okay because he was able to speak, saying that he was using up a lot of oxygen pleading for help. \u2018They going to kill me,\u2019 Floyd said as officers sat atop him in the street. \u2026 Floyd went lifeless minutes later and was pronounced dead.\u201cThe newly disclosed transcripts of audio from body cameras worn by J. Alexander Kueng and Thomas K. Lane, two of the four former Minneapolis police officers charged in Floyd\u2019s killing, were disclosed in court Wednesday as Lane\u2019s attorney sought to have charges against his client dismissed, arguing that there is not enough evidence that he committed a crime. Lane, according to the transcripts, appeared to ask Chauvin \u2014 the most senior officer at the scene \u2014 whether they should reposition Floyd. Chauvin, according to the transcripts, declined \u2026 Transcripts show that Lane approached the car and called on Floyd at least five times to show his hands, drawing his gun when he didn\u2019t. \u2018I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m sorry,\u2019 Floyd responded, according to a transcript of Lane\u2019s body camera. \u2026\u00a0\u201cAs Lane asked him to step out of the car, Floyd apologized several times and repeatedly asked the officer not to shoot him. \u2026 The transcripts show that Floyd continued to ask officers not to shoot him as he stepped from his vehicle, and suggest that he struggled with officers as they tried to handcuff him. \u2026 Lane asked [witness Shawanda Renee] Hill about Floyd\u2019s behavior \u2026 \u2018He\u2019s been shot before,\u2019 Hill said. \u2026 According to the transcript of footage from Kueng\u2019s body camera, the officer sat Floyd down on a sidewalk and explained that he was being detained for suspicion of passing fake U.S. currency. Floyd said he understood. \u2026 He begged to be released from his handcuffs, promising he wouldn\u2019t hurt anyone \u2026 The officers restrained him on the ground \u2026 \u2018My neck hurts,\u2019 Floyd said. \u2026 \u2018They going to kill me, man.\u2019 \u2018Takes a heck lot of oxygen to say that,\u2019 Chauvin said.\u201dDawit Kelete, the man who allegedly drove a car into Seattle demonstrators, killing protester Summer Taylor, was charged with vehicular homicide.

He wants schools to be fully open in the fall. He wants a Republican convention next month to be as normal as possible. So far, the public isn\u2019t buying.The president has the bully pulpit but the public is looking at what\u2019s happening around them.\u00a0About half of states are recording increases in the number of cases of covid-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. In some places, the increases have been dramatic. State and local leaders have been forced to reverse course on previous efforts to reopen businesses.Attitudes are shifting almost as dramatically as the spread of the disease.\u00a0Recent Gallup polling, reported by the organization\u2019s Jeffrey M. Jones, tells the story. More people now say the situation with the virus is getting worse than at any time during the pandemic and expectations about how long the disruption might last are shifting as well. The changes are not at the margins.ADADIn early June, 47 percent said the virus situation was getting a little or a lot better, while 30 percent said it was getting a little or a lot worse. (The rest said it was staying the same.) By the end of June, the numbers had flipped, with 23 percent saying the situation was a little or a lot better and 65 percent saying it was a little or a lot worse. In a month, there was a 35-point spike in the percentage of people saying things were getting worse.The previous high point of those saying things were getting worse was in early April, when 56 percent said that. Through most of the spring and early summer, the percentage saying things were getting worse hovered around 42 percent.As the disease spreads, Americans are recalibrating their expectations about the future. In the late June survey, 74 percent said they now expect disruption of their lives due to the disease to last until the end of this year or longer. That group is split evenly between those who expect things to return closer to normal by year\u2019s end and those who say it will be at least sometime in 2021 before that happens.ADADIn early June, 54 percent said they thought the disruptions would last to the end of the year or beyond. That means during the month of June, there was a 20-point jump in the direction of pessimism about the lasting effects of the pandemic.As with all such polling, there are significant partisan differences in the way people see things.While 90 percent of Democrats said things are getting worse, just 28 percent of Republicans held that view. Among independents, 63 percent said the situation is getting worse.But the trendlines all moved in unison toward more concern. In the week between June 21 and June 28, there was a 15-point rise among Democrats, an 18-point jump among independents and an 8-point increase among Republicans.ADMore people are worried about getting covid-19. Currently, 56 percent say they are worried, which is just 1 point below the peak of concern back in April and a rise of 9 points since early June.People are more cautious about going out in public. In one week, the percentage who said even healthy people with no symptoms should stay at home as much as possible rose 6 points, from 66 percent to 72 percent. That compares with 28 percent who said that healthy people should try to lead their lives as normally as possible.Trump\u2019s latest initiative is to encourage schools to open up this fall.\u00a0He pressed the idea on Tuesday and on Wednesday morning tweeted his displeasure with the guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, calling them \u201cvery tough and expensive.\u201d He said the CDC was asking schools to do \u201cvery impractical things,\u201d adding, \u201cI will be meeting with them!!!\u201d A few hours later, Vice President Pence said the CDC will soon reissue school guidance. Yet on Thursday morning, CDC Director Robert Redfield said on ABC's \u201cGood Morning America\u201d that the guidelines won't be revised, but \u201cwe are going to provide additional reference documents.\u201dADADThat continues a pattern of the president disagreeing with the scientists and institutions tasked with public health and attempting to jawbone them into taking a different position. But there is now a track record of what can happen when states and cities ignore guidelines.Some of the states that moved fastest to reopen their economies \u2014 \u00a0in many cases paying minimal attention to the government\u2019s guidelines on when and how to reopen \u2014 \u00a0have since seen enormous increases in coronavirus cases. Among them are Texas, Arizona and Florida.The issue of school reopening is enormously difficult. School administrators are weighing the health risks to students, their families and their communities of fully returning to schools this fall against the long-term damage to young people who could fall behind academically and in their social development if they are not back in the classroom. That is especially the case for elementary and secondary students without access to fast Internet, good computers and parents who can spend time helping with remote learning.ADADColleges and universities are weighing the same issues, as well as the economic costs to their institutions of lost tuition money if they aren\u2019t providing a learning environment attractive to students. On a cautionary note, there is some evidence there are clear risks of having thousands of young people gathered on campuses, studying and partying as they are likely to do.Trump prefers to be a cheerleader, painting rhetorically with a broad brush that pushes aside the complications that come with all these decisions. The reason is obvious. He wants to return to the pre-pandemic America, a country with a vibrant economy, which he sought as the foundation of his reelection campaign.Instead, reality continues to get in his way. Trump can say what he does, but people are drawing their own conclusions \u2014 about the state of the coronavirus crisis, the risks they face personally and how to continually adjust their behavior.ADADUntil the spread begins to decline widely, most Americans are likely to be cautious. They will not be looking to the president to make that judgment for them.Quote of the day\u201cA lot people thought once the alarm was sounded back in March surely the federal government would fix this, but that hasn\u2019t happened,\u201d said Deborah Burger, a California nurse and the president of National Nurses United. (William Wan)\u00a0More on the coronavirusHospitals across the Sun Belt are strained.\u00a0\u201cIn pandemic hotspot states such as Florida, Arizona, California and Texas, hospitals are adding new intensive care unit beds and special air-flow systems to treat the growing demand as virus hospitalizations set records almost daily. To cope with the wave of patients, hospitals are canceling elective surgeries to free up space for those sick with the virus. Medical staff warn they could become overwhelmed,\u201d Chelsea Janes, Isaac Stanley-Becker, Lenny Bernstein and Joshua Partlow report. \u201cThe United States passed the 3 million case mark on Wednesday, and more than 129,000 people have died. Florida is rushing some 100 new health-care workers to \u00adMiami-Dade County\u2019s public hospital network to handle the influx of coronavirus cases, including 75 nurses who will be ready to work in intensive care units. \u2026 Texas on Wednesday reported 98 deaths from covid-19, a one-day high that surpassed its earlier record reached on Tuesday, when Arizona and Mississippi also reached one-day highs. Arizona and Texas also hit new highs this week in seven-day rolling averages of deaths. \u2026 About 45 percent of the Texas Medical Center\u2019s 1,364 intensive care unit beds are now filled with coronavirus patients. \u2026 Hospitals are also feeling the strain in Los Angeles County, which is averaging around 2,300 new cases each day.\"The country is running short on masks, gowns and gloves. Again.\u00a0\u201cNurses say they are reusing N95 masks for days and even weeks at a time. Doctors say they can\u2019t reopen offices because they lack personal protective equipment. State officials say they have scoured U.S. and international suppliers for PPE and struggle to get orders filled. Experts worry the problem could worsen as coronavirus infections climb, straining medical systems,\u201d William Wan reports. \u201cIn interviews, White House officials said concerns over PPE shortages are overblown. They said U.S. manufacturing and stockpiles of protective equipment have improved dramatically and are adequate in most states. \u2026 Demand for protective equipment has soared, but unlike in March, when efforts focused on getting PPE for major hospitals \u2026 supplies now are desperately needed by primary care offices, nursing homes, prisons and psychiatric and disability facilities.\u201dTrump\u2019s Tulsa rally is \u201clikely\u201d the source of a virus surge.Tulsa City-County Health Department Director Bruce Dart said the rally \u201clikely contributed\u201d to a dramatic surge in new cases, the AP reports. \u201cTulsa County reported 261 confirmed new cases on Monday, a one-day record high, and another 206 cases on Tuesday. By comparison, during the week before the June 20 Trump rally, there were 76 cases on Monday and 96 on Tuesday. Although the health department\u2019s policy is to not publicly identify individual settings where people may have contracted the virus, Dart said those large gatherings \u2018more than likely\u2019 contributed to the spike.\u201d\u00a0ADADA rapidly growing number of Houston-area residents are dying at home, according to an NBC News and ProPublica investigation. A growing number of these at-home deaths have been linked to covid-19.A Texas GOP convention originally scheduled to be held next week in Houston has been canceled,\u00a0Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner (D) said. \"These are some very serious times,\" Turner said. \"Simply, the public health concerns outweighed anything else.\" (Texas Tribune)But, but, but: Trump is heading to Odessa, Tex., later this month for a fundraiser.\u00a0The invite to the event, shared by the Tribune\u2019s Patrick Svitek, doesn\u2019t specify where in the city the fundraiser will be held, but tickets range from $2,800 to $100,000.Disney World will reopen on Saturday, despite Florida\u2019s worsening outbreak. Disney says that instituting an aggressive cleaning schedule and slew of new health protocols while dramatically cutting down on the visitors allowed means that it can open safely.

(Dana Hedgpeth, Julie Zauzmer and Erin Cox)Trump wants schools to reopen. But school officials are pushing against it.\u00a0School officials across the country have concluded they cannot fully reopen while following new CDC guidance that recommends that students be kept six feet apart to prevent spreading the virus, because classrooms are too small to accommodate all students with the recommended distancing, Laura Meckler reports. \u201cThe administration is finding it nearly impossible to control the situation, with the president\u2019s views often at odds with those of his health advisers \u2026 On Wednesday, New York City schools, the nation\u2019s largest school system, announced a plan that will have most students in school two days a week and learning from home the other three. Many other systems have announced or are considering similar plans. \u2026. Trump \u2026 ended with a nebulous threat: \u2018May cut off funding if not open!\u2019 Trump has no power to cut federal funding already allocated to states and districts, but the vice president suggested the administration would seek to tie any future aid to opening of schools.\"Harvard and MIT sued the Trump administration to protect international students.\u00a0\u201cThe\u00a0lawsuit\u00a0represented a swift response to\u00a0an unexpected order issued this week by the federal government, as universities rush to protect the status of thousands of international students. It also marks a new battle line in the war between Trump and education leaders over how to safely reopen schools in the midst of his reelection bid,\u201d Susan Svrluga and Nick Anderson report. \u201cIn their lawsuit, the universities argue that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement\u2019s decision was designed to force universities to conduct in-person classes, part of an apparent political strategy from the Trump administration to pressure schools, from kindergarten to graduate school, to fully reopen this fall, even as virus cases soar. \u2026 The lawsuit cites remarks from acting deputy secretary of homeland security Ken Cuccinelli on Tuesday, in which he said the directive \u2018will \u2026 encourage schools to reopen.\u2019\u201d\u00a0Retail workers are caught in the latest culture war: Getting customers to wear face masks.\u00a0\u201cMixed messaging and politicization have turned a public health safeguard into a lightning-rod issue. As a result, workers have been berated, even assaulted, by aggressive anti-maskers,\u201d Abha Bhattarai reports. \u201cSome workers say they have been told they cannot refuse service to maskless customers, even if local laws require it. Others feel they\u2019ve been put in the awkward and sometimes dangerous position of confronting shoppers who refuse to wear the coverings. In recent weeks, retail workers have been punched in the face, suffered broken limbs and, in the case of\u00a0a security guard at a Family Dollar\u00a0store in Michigan, killed while trying to enforce mask requirements.\u201d\u00a0ADADThe head of the TSA ordered new covid-19 safety precautions after meeting with a whistleblower who said the agency wasn\u2019t doing enough.\u00a0\u201cThe new measures require officers to wear eye protection when they are in close contact with travelers and aren\u2019t protected by a plastic screen, the attorney said. Officers must also change their gloves or sanitize them after patting down passengers, handling identification documents or checking in luggage,\u201d Ian Duncan reports. \u00a0United Airlines warned that it may furlough 36,000 of its employees, almost half of its U.S. workforce. (WSJ)On some planes, some rows are kept empty even as passengers are crowded together.\u00a0On an American Airlines flight, \u201cJoy Gonzalez, an aviation engineer based in Seattle, found herself seated at a window with two older passengers beside her in the middle and aisle seats. In order to gain more social distance, she and the aisle passenger both moved to seats behind them where two rows were empty. But before takeoff, a flight attendant ordered them back to their assigned seats, telling them they had not paid for those exit row seats, which are more expensive,\u201d the Times reports. \u201cAirlines vowed to bring social distancing to the air \u2026 by reducing capacity and blocking many middle seats. Now as air travel builds, freeing up that kind of space is plainly at odds with the airlines\u2019 profit motive, and passengers are finding they may be confined to a cramped seat if they don\u2019t pay for a premium one.\u201d\u00a0ADThings you can no longer do in Japan's theme parks: scream.\u00a0\u201cPlease scream inside your heart,\u201d said two theme park executives in an informational video shown to guests in Japan, the WSJ reports. \u201cFrom Fujiyama to Tokyo DisneySea\u2019s Tower of Terror, Japan\u2019s campaign against the coronavirus is targeting thrill-seekers who might expel a burst of virus-carrying droplets with a mid-ride utterance.

Americans for Tax Reform Foundation, led by firebrand anti-tax advocate Grover Norquist, took a loan between $150,000 and $350,000 from the Paycheck Protection Program. The Ayn Rand Institute and Citizens against Government Waste likewise accepted loans funded by the program,\u201d Tom Hamburger, Aaron Gregg and Anu Narayanswamy report. \u201cAmericans for Tax Reform Foundation is one of two related tax revision groups led by Norquist, who famously said: \u2018I don\u2019t want to abolish government.

The law itself doesn\u2019t specify the rules, leaving it to federal agencies to determine how contraceptives fit into the mandate for cost-free \u2018preventive care and screenings.\u2019 The Obama administration required contraceptives and had narrower exceptions for churches and other houses of worship. \u2026 The Trump administration moved in 2018 to expand the types of organizations that could opt out to include religious groups and nonreligious employers with moral and religious objections. \u2026\u00a0\u201cThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the 3rd Circuit had put the Trump administration exemptions on hold, and said the agencies didn\u2019t have the broad authority to grant them. Justice Clarence Thomas, who wrote the majority opinion, said that was wrong. \u2026 Liberal Justices Elena Kagan and Stephen G. Breyer agreed with the court\u2019s conservatives that the administration had the right to create an exemption, but they said lower courts should examine whether the administration\u2019s rules were \u2018consistent with reasoned judgment.\u2019 Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg issued a blistering dissent, in which she said her colleagues had gone too far to appease religious conservatives.\u201dThe Court also gave religious organizations the ability to hire and fire without offending some anti-discrimination laws.\u201cIn a 7-to-2 decision, the court strengthened the \u2018ministerial exception\u2019 it found in 2012 that protects religious organizations from some employment lawsuits. It said two teachers at parochial schools who wanted to contest their firings in court were the kinds of employees who were covered by the exception and thus unable to sue. It indicated that those involved in almost any kind of religious instruction would be considered \u2018ministers\u2019 of the faith, no matter their official title or even if they practiced the faith themselves,\u201d Robert Barnes reports. \u201cJustices Sonia Sotomayor and Ginsburg dissented, saying the decision gave religious employers \u2018free rein to discriminate.\u2019 \u2026 Breyer and Kagan, usually part of the court\u2019s liberal bloc, voted with the majority.\u201dThe Supreme Court\u2019s decisions will conclude today with what could be a blockbuster decision on whether Trump may shield his private financial records and tax returns from congressional committees and a New York prosecutor.As the economy reels from the pandemic, Trump and Mexico\u2019s L\u00f3pez Obrador mark the start of a trade pact.\u00a0\u201cTrump marked the start of a three-nation regional trade deal in a Rose Garden ceremony with Mexican President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador,\u201d David Nakamura and David Lynch report. \u201cThe two populist-leaning presidents, from opposite ends of the political spectrum, signed a joint proclamation hailing the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement \u2026 Trump thanked his counterpart for responding to U.S. pressure to help curb a major spike in unauthorized immigration last year \u2026 L\u00f3pez Obrador responded that Trump has \u2018honored our position as an independent nation\u2019 and \u2018behaved with kindness and respect.\u2019 The positive comments from the two leaders on Wednesday were striking when compared with the tensions between the neighboring countries in recent years.\"The Russian ambassador said reports of a bounty program to kill U.S. soldiers are a \u201cdownright lie.\u201d\u201c\u2018No concrete evidence has been presented\u2019 of allegations that a Russian military intelligence unit offered to pay Taliban-linked militants to target American and other coalition forces, Anatoly Antonov said.

Lane, according to the transcripts, appeared to ask Chauvin \u2014 the most senior officer at the scene \u2014 whether they should reposition Floyd. Chauvin, according to the transcripts, declined \u2026 Transcripts show that Lane approached the car and called on Floyd at least five times to show his hands, drawing his gun when he didn\u2019t. \u2018I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m sorry,\u2019 Floyd responded, according to a transcript of Lane\u2019s body camera. \u2026\u00a0\u201cAs Lane asked him to step out of the car, Floyd apologized several times and repeatedly asked the officer not to shoot him. \u2026 The transcripts show that Floyd continued to ask officers not to shoot him as he stepped from his vehicle, and suggest that he struggled with officers as they tried to handcuff him. \u2026 Lane asked [witness Shawanda Renee] Hill about Floyd\u2019s behavior \u2026 \u2018He\u2019s been shot before,\u2019 Hill said. \u2026 According to the transcript of footage from Kueng\u2019s body camera, the officer sat Floyd down on a sidewalk and explained that he was being detained for suspicion of passing fake U.S. currency.

But the signatories to the paper say the potential of the virus to spread via airborne transmission has not been fully appreciated even by public health institutions such as the WHO.ADADThe paper, which was shared with The Washington Post ahead of publication this week in the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases, comes as the WHO faces criticism over its coronavirus response, calls for reform and a U.S. threat to cut funding and withdraw completely.Elegant but unproven, RNA experiments leap to the front in coronavirus vaccine race. Will they work?The fact that scientists resorted to a paper to pressure the WHO is unusual, analysts said, and is likely to renew questions about the WHO\u2019s messaging.\u201cWHO\u2019s credibility is being undermined through a steady drip-drip of confusing messages, including asymptomatic spread, the use of masks, and now airborne transmission,\u201d said Lawrence Gostin, a professor of global health law at Georgetown University who provides technical assistance to the organization.ADHe praised the WHO for hosting regular briefings and acknowledged that the organization is in a tough spot because it \u201chas to make recommendations for the entire world and it feels it needs irrefutable scientific proof before coming to a conclusion.\u201dADBut he warned that \u201cthe public, and even scientists, will lose full confidence in WHO without clearer technical guidance.\u201dA spokesperson for the organization said it is aware of media reports about the issue and will have technical experts review the matter. The agency has repeatedly defended its handling of the pandemic.The WHO, which was founded in 1948, is the U.N. agency tasked with promoting global health. It plays a critical role in expanding access to health care, setting up vaccination programs and fighting diseases such as polio.ADBut its portfolio has grown faster than its budget. And in times of crisis, it has often struggled to lead.Stay safe and informed with our free Coronavirus Updates newsletterSince the early days of the coronavirus crisis, the WHO and its director-general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, have been dogged by questions about whether the agency\u2019s effusive praise for China created a false sense of security and potentially spurred the spread of covid-19, the disease caused by the virus.ADThat criticism has been compounded at various points by questions about its positions on technical issues, including transmission, mask use \u2014 and, now, airborne transmission.The signatories to the paper contend that the virus can still spread through aerosols, or tiny respiratory droplets, that infected people cough or otherwise release into the air. In crowded or poorly ventilated indoor settings, this could be especially dangerous, and would account for a number of \u201csuperspreading\u201d incidents.AD\u201cThere is no reason for fear. It is not like the virus has changed. We think it has been transmitted this way all along,\u201d said Jose Jimenez, a chemist at the University of Colorado who signed the paper. \u201cKnowing about it helps target the measures to control the pandemic more accurately.\u201dCo-author Donald Milton, a professor of environmental health at the University of Maryland, said the WHO\u2019s apparent reluctance to emphasize this aspect of the virus\u2019s ability to spread is probably because of the difficulty identifying tiny infectious particles.AD\u201cIt is easy to find virus on surfaces, on hands, in large drops,\u201d he said in an emailed statement. \u201cBut, it is very hard to find much less culture virus from the air \u2014 it is a major technical challenge and naive investigators routinely fail to find it. .\u2009.\u2009.AD\u201cBecause a person breathes 10,000 to 15,000 liters of air a day and it only takes one infectious dose in that volume of air, sampling 100 or even 1000 liters of air and not finding virus is meaningless.\u201dBrazil, ravaged by the coronavirus, becomes key testing ground for vaccineWhatever the verdict on transmissibility, the paper is another headache for the WHO as it seeks to lead the response while fending off months of criticism.In the early days of the crisis, WHO repeated Chinese claims on case numbers and transmission uncritically. When questioned, WHO officials defended Beijing, with the director-general, Tedros, going so far as to personally laud Chinese President Xi Jinping\u2019s leadership.ADTedros\u2019s defenders thought he was merely being diplomatic. It is true that as a member-state organization, the WHO could not compel China to provide accurate data \u2014 or march in to collect it.ADBut by early February, even the organization\u2019s traditional supporters, including current and former advisers, were expressing concern about the praise, worried that the tone was undermining other aspects of the response.In news conferences, Tedros and other top officials tried to deliver an important message \u2014 \u201ctest, test, test\u201d \u2014 but were often pulled off course by questions about the organization\u2019s ties to China.Studies leave question of \u2018airborne\u2019 coronavirus transmission unansweredAs the crisis spread from Asia to Europe and the United States, President Trump seized on the critique, using the agency\u2019s treatment of China to divert attention from shortcomings in the U.S. response.ADIn April, Trump announced that he was freezing all new funding to the organization. In late May, he said the United States planned to withdraw from the organization.ADJimenez said the scientists\u2019 purpose was not to hurt the agency, but merely to encourage it to consider new information.\u201cOur group of scientists doesn\u2019t want to do anything that would undermine the WHO as an organization,\u201d he said. \u201cWe only want it to adapt its guidance on aerosol transmission to the increasing evidence.\u201d\n\n\n\nChinese officials note serious problems in coronavirus response.

But advertisers and the agencies they work with say they are still negotiating.\u00a0ADADThey want more than Facebook's pledge to label some politicians\u2019 posts when they break the company\u2019s policies. Civil rights leaders who organized the boycott are expected to meet with top Facebook executives, including chief executive Mark Zuckerberg, this week.More than 750 companies including Coca-Cola, Hershey and Unilever have temporarily paused their advertising on Facebook and its subsidiary Instagram.\u00a0Kerri Pollard, senior vice president of the membership platform Patreon \u2014 which is pulling all of its ads from Facebook and Instagram \u2014 said the recent string of concessions doesn't address the company's concerns about how Zuckerberg characterizes free speech.

Black employees are breaking norms by speaking out against employers and investors who did not take seriously their stories of toxic bias. Employees from Facebook, LinkedIn and other tech companies also have spoken out.\u201cOn the one hand, Pinterest was fine with me being the person interviewed on \u2018All Things Considered,\u2019 the person who\u2019s doing press all around the world on behalf of the company for an initiative I\u2019m leading,\u201d Ozoma said. \u201cAnd on the other hand, they just completely did not believe that I had enough sense and enough ability, both financially and otherwise,\u201d to keep pursuing her bias claims, which she felt Pinterest had shrugged off.Pinterest declined to comment on specific allegations. The company pointed to a note Pinterest CEO Ben Silbermann sent employees last week, which was included in a statement announcing Pinterest\u2019s board of directors hired the law firm WilmerHale to conduct an independent review of the culture.\u201cThis is important work that will help us make Pinterest better,\u201d Silbermann wrote, urging his staff to prioritize following up if they were contacted by the firm.Rant and raveKanye West has at least one prominent tech industry supporter as he runs for president:Inside the industryUber agreed to acquire food delivery rival Postmates for $2.65 billion in an all-stock takeover.\u00a0The deal is expected to be announced as early as today, report Bloomberg's Eric Newcomer, Liana Baker and Katie Roof.

That, she told Heather Long in a PostLive interview Wednesday, would come about \u201cif we can get the public health issues under control either through a really robust mitigation strategy or a vaccine\u2026 But if we end up with a pervasive long-listing hit to the economy, then it could take longer.\u201dADADEconomists surveyed by the Wall Street Journal said they expect the economy added 2.9 million jobs in June, nudging the unemployment rate down to 12.4 percent, the paper's Sarah Chaney reports. That would \u201cstill leave the U.S. with about 17 million fewer jobs than in February, the month before the coronavirus pandemic struck the U.S. economy.\u201d And the jobs report set for release this morning, \u201cbased on survey data largely collected in mid-June, won\u2019t reflect these recent government-mandated business closures and related layoffs.\u201dPROGRAMMING NOTE: We're going dark for the holiday tomorrow and will be back on Monday.

Powell has repeatedly said that the path out of this recession, which began in February, will depend on containing the virus and giving Americans the confidence to resume normal working and spending habits. But the notes from the two-day meeting reveal how interconnected Fed officials view a prolonged economic recession and the pandemic\u2019s continued spread \u2014 and why Powell often asserts that lawmakers will need to do more to carry millions of Americans out of this crisis.\u201dMain Street Lending Program sees lukewarm interest: \u201cThe government is offering to lend up to $600 billion to help small and midsize businesses weather the coronavirus-induced recession, but so far interest has been sparse,\u201d WSJ's Paul Kiernan reports.\u201cMore than two months after the program was announced, however, some bankers say they are still trying to decide whether to take part. They cite less-than-appealing terms, which changed repeatedly before the official June 15 launch, and anemic interest among potential borrowers.\u201dFrom the HillGOP senators are glad the unemployment benefit boost is ending: \u201cSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Tuesday that the unemployment benefit passed in the Cares Act in March won't be in the next phase of coronavirus relief, which he said he expects to pass by the end of July. He argued that it has encouraged many Americans to remain jobless,\u201d NBC's Sahil Kapur reports.ADAD\u201cIn interviews with nearly a dozen GOP senators \u2026 a consistent theme emerged: They are certain they don't want to extend the $600 per week in emergency jobless compensation because they widely agree that it is motivating people to stay out of work. But they have little clarity on what ought to replace it.\u201dBut Democrats want to tie worker benefits to joblessness in each state: \u201cSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) introduced legislation that would tie enhanced unemployment benefits to joblessness levels in each state, the most prominent effort yet to expand federal policies that kick in automatically during a recession,\u201d Politico's Victoria Guida reports.\u201cUnder the bill, the additional $600 a week that jobless workers have been receiving during this economic crisis would be phased out in stages in each state as its unemployment rate drops below 11 percent.\u201dCoronavirus falloutTrump appears to back another round of stimulus checks.But double checking his remarks leave his stance a little vague: \u201cAsked by Fox Business if he supports \u2018another round of direct payments for individuals\u2019 \u2014 a reference to the $1,200 stimulus payments \u2014 the president said: \u2018I do. I support it. But it has to be done properly. And I support actually larger numbers than the Democrats. But it\u2019s got to be done properly,'\" Jeff Stein reports.ADAD\u201cRepublicans have so far rejected Democratic lawmakers\u2019 push to send out $2,000 per person a month to Americans during the pandemic. In the next sentence, Trump appeared to highlight conservative concerns over the impact of higher unemployment insurance payments on discouraging Americans to return to the labor market. That made it unclear if the president was expressing support for another round of direct stimulus payments, or some other form of federal help for individual taxpayers. A White House spokesman declined to clarify what the president meant.\"Treasury now owns 30 percent of a trucking company: \u201cUnder the unusual arrangement, the Treasury Department will provide the emergency loan to YRC Worldwide, while taking a 29.6 percent equity stake in the company. The U.S. government does not typically take ownership stakes in companies but was given permission to do so by Congress as a way to ensure taxpayer funds are not misspent,\u201d Jeff Stein and Aaron Gregg report.\u201cThe deal is the first under a $17 billion loan program approved as part of the broader stimulus by Congress in March. That pot of money was earmarked for firms deemed \u2018critical\u2019 to U.S. national security.

Subscribe today.arrow-rightIt\u2019s a hugely emotional and fraught topic as the coronavirus pandemic continues to worsen in the United States. Parents worry about not being able to return to their jobs because of kids stuck at home, teachers fret about getting ill in the classroom and health professionals are anxious about the educational and emotional effects on kids, especially those in disadvantaged homes.\u201cSchool communities desperate for normalcy are hoping that the new school year will be more stable than the last, when the coronavirus forced schools to close and launch remote learning overnight,\u201d The Post's Valerie Strauss writes. \u201cBut that seems like wishful thinking, as 2020-2021 is shaping up to be even more problematic.\u201dThe American Academy of Pediatrics is urging schools to prioritize students learning while \u201cphysically present in school.\u201d Keeping children away from school \u2013 and the social services many access there \u2013 could be more risky for kids than potentially exposing them to a virus that is largely bypassing them, the AAP said in a statement that garnered widespread attention this week.ADAD\u201cThe importance of in-person learning is well-documented, and there is already evidence of the negative impacts on children because of school closures in the spring of 2020,\u201d the statement said.Yet a handful of school districts have announced major shifts away from in-classroom learning for the fall.\u00a0Hundreds more around the nation are grappling with weighty decisions of whether and how to bring kids back to elementary, middle and high schools in two months or less.Fairfax County in Virginia, which includes one of the largest school districts, is asking parents to choose between 100 percent virtual learning or part-time in-person schooling in the fall, my colleague Hannah Natanson reported. Virginia's Loudoun County approved a similar plan this week.AD\u201cUnder the plan endorsed Monday, the amount of in-person schooling the Northern Virginia district of 84,000 offers will differ depending on which phase of Gov. Ralph Northam\u2019s reopening process the state has entered by the time school starts,\u201d Hannah writes.ADVirginia transitioned to Phase 3 of its reopening yesterday, meaning child-care centers can reopen and the cap on social gatherings will rise to 250. If the state is still in Phase 3 by the time school begins, families who selected the hybrid option will send their kids to school just two days a week.\u00a0But if the state slides back to Phase 2, \u201call students will be required to learn 100 percent virtually except for students with disabilities, English-language learners and students in prekindergarten through third grade,\u201d Hannah reports.ADSchools in other states are also dealing with an uncertain future. In Arizona, which is daily hitting new highs in cases, Gov. Doug Ducey (R) ordered bars, gyms, movie theaters and water parks to shut down for at least 30 days and ordered public schools to delay the start of classes until Aug. 17.ADKathy Hoffman, Arizona's Superintendent of Public Instruction:Teachers' unions aren\u2019t happy with a hybrid approach.Teachers in Fairfax County say they\u2019ll refuse to teach in-person until the district revises its strategy. \u201cThe teachers\u2019 resistance previews the kind of backlash administrators throughout the country may encounter as they ask their workforce to return to school hallways,\u201d Hannah writes.ADNEA President Lily Eskelson Garcia seemed to downplay the AAP guidance, telling me she feels people \u201cmisinterpreted\u201d it to mean schools should prioritize reopening over any other considerations.\u201cI\u2019ll respond and I\u2019ll try to keep the four letter words out,\u201d she said, when asked to respond to the group\u2019s statement.Garcia feels teachers \u201care the last ones\u201d being consulted as schools are drawing up reopening plans. She worries teachers will be asked to do more with fewer resources \u2013 because districts are seeing revenue dry up due to the lockdowns \u2013 and won\u2019t be provided with adequate supplies to protect themselves from the virus.ADAnd the argument that parents will be unable to return to work because their kids are at home is a \u201cnonstarter,\" she said.AD\u201cI don\u2019t freaking care about getting the parents back to work,\u201d Garcia said. \u201cI care about opening a school carefully so those kids have a decent education.\u201dYet scientific research \u2013 and outcomes in other countries \u2013 suggests sending kids back to school may be low risk.In an extensive statement that recommended measures like mask-wearing and social distancing, the AAP noted children and teenagers are far less likely to be symptomatic and less likely to have severe disease. Indeed, children ages 5-17 have so far accounted for fewer than 0.1 percent of U.S. deaths from covid-19 and 4.3 percent of known cases, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.ADResearchers at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine recently found children were 35 to 60 percent less susceptible to coronavirus infection than adults 20 and over, writing that \u201cinterventions aimed at children might have a relatively small impact on reducing SARS-CoV-2 transmission.\u201dADSome research has also suggested \u2013 although more is needed \u2013 that kids spread the virus to others less frequently than their adult counterparts. If that bears out, teachers may be at less risk of contracting the virus in the classroom than previously thought.And some European countries didn\u2019t see significant increases in new cases when they began sending children back to school in April and early May. Denmark, Austria and Germany haven\u2019t reported spikes due to school reopenings, which include mandates around mask-wearing and social distancing.Reopening schools may bring outsized benefits.\u201cSchools should be prioritized,\u201d Boston University epidemiologist Helen Jenkins and Harvard School of Public Health professor William Hanage wrote in an op-ed for The Post.\u00a0ADJenkins and Hanage argue that because schools are so crucial to the well-being of children, reopening them should be prioritized. In order to slow transmission of the virus so that schools can open safely, stricter rules should be imposed right now on places like restaurants and stores, they write.AD\u201cLong school closures during the novel\u00a0coronavirus\u00a0pandemic have exacerbated existing inequalities: Children whose parents can invest in a computer and an expensive online learning program will fall behind less than others whose parents cannot, or those who are working essential jobs that mean it\u2019s impossible to support home schooling,\u201d the pair argued.Zeynep Tufekci, associate professor at University of Southern California:Dear readers: The Health 202 won't be publishing tomorrow in honor of Independence Day. Have a safe and relaxing holiday weekend, and we'll see you back here on Monday.Ahh, oof and ouchAHH: Coronavirus infections surged nearly 50 percent last month.\u201cMore than 800,000 new cases were reported across the country last month, led by Florida, Arizona, Texas and California \u2014 bringing the nation\u2019s officially reported total to just over 2.6 million,\u201d The Post's Anne Gearan, Derek Hawkins and Siobhan O'Grady report.ADADThe virus is particularly spreading in the South and Southwest. \u201cMore than 52,000 new cases were reported in the United States on Wednesday, the highest total since the start of the pandemic,\u201d my colleagues write. \u201cRecord-shattering numbers of new cases were reported Wednesday in six states \u2014 California, Georgia, Texas, Alaska, North Carolina and Arizona.\u201dCalifornia reported 110 new deaths yesterday, more than any other state. Its governor, Gavin Newsom (D), ordered 19 counties to shut down all indoor services and activities before the holiday weekend, meaning that bars, restaurants and other businesses will remain open only outside.\u201cNewsom\u2019s order was the latest step the governor has taken to impose new rules on counties that, in late spring, appeared to have the virus largely under control,\u201d they write. \u201cWhile it names only a minority of California\u2019s 58 counties, the reclosing order will affect nearly 75\u00a0percent of the state\u2019s residents, including those who live in Los Angeles, Silicon Valley and the East Bay area.\u201dADOther governors are also ramping up restrictions. \u201cPennsylvania ordered protective masks to be worn in public, and New York City delayed the planned loosening of restrictions on indoor dining. Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D) ordered the end of indoor service at bars through most of the state\u2019s lower region, citing a spike in cases among younger people,\u201d Anne, Derek and Siobhan write.Caitlin Rivers, epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security:OOF: Trump appears to back another round of stimulus payments to millions of Americans.But his jumbled remarks on a Fox Business interview yesterday left his position somewhat unclear, The Post's Jeff Stein reports.\u201cThere are sharp divisions among Republicans about whether to approve a second round of $1,200 payments, and the president\u2019s own aides haven\u2019t reached a consensus,\u201d Jeff writes. \u201cThe first round of payments, approved in late March, went to more than 150 million American households.\u201dAsked by Fox Business if he supports \u201canother round of direct payments for individuals,\" the president said: \u201cI do. I support it. But it has to be done properly. And I support actually larger numbers than the Democrats.

Subscribe today.arrow-rightIt\u2019s a hugely emotional and fraught topic as the coronavirus pandemic continues to worsen in the United States. Parents worry about not being able to return to their jobs because of kids stuck at home, teachers fret about getting ill in the classroom and health professionals are anxious about the educational and emotional effects on kids, especially those in disadvantaged homes.\u201cSchool communities desperate for normalcy are hoping that the new school year will be more stable than the last, when the coronavirus forced schools to close and launch remote learning overnight,\u201d The Post's Valerie Strauss writes. \u201cBut that seems like wishful thinking, as 2020-2021 is shaping up to be even more problematic.\u201dThe American Academy of Pediatrics is urging schools to prioritize students learning while \u201cphysically present in school.\u201d Keeping children away from school \u2013 and the social services many access there \u2013 could be more risky for kids than potentially exposing them to a virus that is largely bypassing them, the AAP said in a statement that garnered widespread attention this week.ADAD\u201cThe importance of in-person learning is well-documented, and there is already evidence of the negative impacts on children because of school closures in the spring of 2020,\u201d the statement said.Yet a handful of school districts have announced major shifts away from in-classroom learning for the fall.\u00a0Hundreds more around the nation are grappling with weighty decisions of whether and how to bring kids back to elementary, middle and high schools in two months or less.Fairfax County in Virginia, which includes one of the largest school districts, is asking parents to choose between 100 percent virtual learning or part-time in-person schooling in the fall, my colleague Hannah Natanson reported. Virginia's Loudoun County approved a similar plan this week.AD\u201cUnder the plan endorsed Monday, the amount of in-person schooling the Northern Virginia district of 84,000 offers will differ depending on which phase of Gov. Ralph Northam\u2019s reopening process the state has entered by the time school starts,\u201d Hannah writes.ADVirginia transitioned to Phase 3 of its reopening yesterday, meaning child-care centers can reopen and the cap on social gatherings will rise to 250. If the state is still in Phase 3 by the time school begins, families who selected the hybrid option will send their kids to school just two days a week.\u00a0But if the state slides back to Phase 2, \u201call students will be required to learn 100 percent virtually except for students with disabilities, English-language learners and students in prekindergarten through third grade,\u201d Hannah reports.ADSchools in other states are also dealing with an uncertain future. In Arizona, which is daily hitting new highs in cases, Gov. Doug Ducey (R) ordered bars, gyms, movie theaters and water parks to shut down for at least 30 days and ordered public schools to delay the start of classes until Aug. 17.ADKathy Hoffman, Arizona's Superintendent of Public Instruction:Teachers' unions aren\u2019t happy with a hybrid approach.Teachers in Fairfax County say they\u2019ll refuse to teach in-person until the district revises its strategy. \u201cThe teachers\u2019 resistance previews the kind of backlash administrators throughout the country may encounter as they ask their workforce to return to school hallways,\u201d Hannah writes.ADNEA President Lily Eskelson Garcia seemed to downplay the AAP guidance, telling me she feels people \u201cmisinterpreted\u201d it to mean schools should prioritize reopening over any other considerations.\u201cI\u2019ll respond and I\u2019ll try to keep the four letter words out,\u201d she said, when asked to respond to the group\u2019s statement.Garcia feels teachers \u201care the last ones\u201d being consulted as schools are drawing up reopening plans. She worries teachers will be asked to do more with fewer resources \u2013 because districts are seeing revenue dry up due to the lockdowns \u2013 and won\u2019t be provided with adequate supplies to protect themselves from the virus.ADAnd the argument that parents will be unable to return to work because their kids are at home is a \u201cnonstarter,\" she said.AD\u201cI don\u2019t freaking care about getting the parents back to work,\u201d Garcia said. \u201cI care about opening a school carefully so those kids have a decent education.\u201dYet scientific research \u2013 and outcomes in other countries \u2013 suggests sending kids back to school may be low risk.In an extensive statement that recommended measures like mask-wearing and social distancing, the AAP noted children and teenagers are far less likely to be symptomatic and less likely to have severe disease. Indeed, children ages 5-17 have so far accounted for fewer than 0.1 percent of U.S. deaths from covid-19 and 4.3 percent of known cases, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.ADResearchers at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine recently found children were 35 to 60 percent less susceptible to coronavirus infection than adults 20 and over, writing that \u201cinterventions aimed at children might have a relatively small impact on reducing SARS-CoV-2 transmission.\u201dADSome research has also suggested \u2013 although more is needed \u2013 that kids spread the virus to others less frequently than their adult counterparts. If that bears out, teachers may be at less risk of contracting the virus in the classroom than previously thought.And some European countries didn\u2019t see significant increases in new cases when they began sending children back to school in April and early May. Denmark, Austria and Germany haven\u2019t reported spikes due to school reopenings, which include mandates around mask-wearing and social distancing.Reopening schools may bring outsized benefits.\u201cSchools should be prioritized,\u201d Boston University epidemiologist Helen Jenkins and Harvard School of Public Health professor William Hanage wrote in an op-ed for The Post.\u00a0ADJenkins and Hanage argue that because schools are so crucial to the well-being of children, reopening them should be prioritized. In order to slow transmission of the virus so that schools can open safely, stricter rules should be imposed right now on places like restaurants and stores, they write.AD\u201cLong school closures during the novel\u00a0coronavirus\u00a0pandemic have exacerbated existing inequalities: Children whose parents can invest in a computer and an expensive online learning program will fall behind less than others whose parents cannot, or those who are working essential jobs that mean it\u2019s impossible to support home schooling,\u201d the pair argued.Zeynep Tufekci, associate professor at University of Southern California:Dear readers: The Health 202 won't be publishing tomorrow in honor of Independence Day. Have a safe and relaxing holiday weekend, and we'll see you back here on Monday.Ahh, oof and ouchAHH: Coronavirus infections surged nearly 50 percent last month.\u201cMore than 800,000 new cases were reported across the country last month, led by Florida, Arizona, Texas and California \u2014 bringing the nation\u2019s officially reported total to just over 2.6 million,\u201d The Post's Anne Gearan, Derek Hawkins and Siobhan O'Grady report.ADADThe virus is particularly spreading in the South and Southwest. \u201cMore than 52,000 new cases were reported in the United States on Wednesday, the highest total since the start of the pandemic,\u201d my colleagues write. \u201cRecord-shattering numbers of new cases were reported Wednesday in six states \u2014 California, Georgia, Texas, Alaska, North Carolina and Arizona.\u201dCalifornia reported 110 new deaths yesterday, more than any other state. Its governor, Gavin Newsom (D), ordered 19 counties to shut down all indoor services and activities before the holiday weekend, meaning that bars, restaurants and other businesses will remain open only outside.\u201cNewsom\u2019s order was the latest step the governor has taken to impose new rules on counties that, in late spring, appeared to have the virus largely under control,\u201d they write. \u201cWhile it names only a minority of California\u2019s 58 counties, the reclosing order will affect nearly 75\u00a0percent of the state\u2019s residents, including those who live in Los Angeles, Silicon Valley and the East Bay area.\u201dADOther governors are also ramping up restrictions. \u201cPennsylvania ordered protective masks to be worn in public, and New York City delayed the planned loosening of restrictions on indoor dining. Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D) ordered the end of indoor service at bars through most of the state\u2019s lower region, citing a spike in cases among younger people,\u201d Anne, Derek and Siobhan write.Caitlin Rivers, epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security:OOF: Trump appears to back another round of stimulus payments to millions of Americans.But his jumbled remarks on a Fox Business interview yesterday left his position somewhat unclear, The Post's Jeff Stein reports.\u201cThere are sharp divisions among Republicans about whether to approve a second round of $1,200 payments, and the president\u2019s own aides haven\u2019t reached a consensus,\u201d Jeff writes. \u201cThe first round of payments, approved in late March, went to more than 150 million American households.\u201dAsked by Fox Business if he supports \u201canother round of direct payments for individuals,\" the president said: \u201cI do. I support it. But it has to be done properly. And I support actually larger numbers than the Democrats. But it\u2019s got to be done properly.\u201dBut then, Trump appeared to highlight concerns that higher unemployment insurance payments could discourage Americans to return to the labor market. \u201cThat made it unclear if the president was expressing support for another round of direct stimulus payments, or some other form of federal help for individual taxpayers,\u201d Jeff writes.\u201cWe had something where they wanted where it gave you a disincentive to work last time.

If you don\u2019t have them, they cease to be trivial,\u201d said Awi Federgruen, a professor of logistics and supply chain management at Columbia University. \u201cA shortage of any one of those will act as a bottleneck.\u201dEven in ordinary circumstances, Americans are sometimes subject to vaccine shortages. The most recent example is the shingles vaccine, which is recommended for people over 50 and requires two shots, an initial dose and a booster. GlaxoSmithKline\u2019s Shingrix vaccine was in short supply in 2019 because it was such an improvement over the previous vaccine that demand rose significantly. Now, because fewer people are venturing out for routine care during the coronavirus pandemic, Shingrix is not in shortage, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.ADThe United States also experienced shortages of influenza vaccine in 2004 and 2005.Stay safe and informed with our free Coronavirus Updates newsletterMedical systems are now experiencing unprecedented urgency to develop and distribute coronavirus vaccines, which will create shocks along the supply chain.ADUnder the most optimistic time frames, hundreds of millions of doses of the first vaccines could be available by the end of 2020. The United States, through the Trump administration\u2019s Operation Warp Speed initiative, is locking down supply while prioritizing a boost in domestic manufacturing of medical supplies, many of which are made overseas in Asia and Europe.The approach to vials and syringes is similar to the Trump administration\u2019s strategy regarding drugs: Spend heavily on contracts with the makers of therapeutics and vaccine makers to secure sufficient supply domestically.AD\u201cSo our priorities are very clear. Let\u2019s take care of Americans first,\u201d a senior administration official said on the condition of anonymity under rules set by Operation Warp Speed officials for participation in a telephone briefing on vaccine procurement last month. The administration also is anticipating demand to jump for syringes with the start of influenza season in the fall and wants to avoid bottlenecks that would create shortages of flu vaccine.ADFor coronavirus, the industry is settling on 10-milliliter vials, capable of holding eight to 15 doses, as the most common standard.A big part of the reason for multi-dose vials is to conserve glass supply; for many common vaccines, single-dose vials and single-dose, pre-filled syringes have become commonplace, although multi-dose vials are available as well, according to the CDC.ADCorning, the U.S. glassmaker based in New York, is tapping a $204 million government contract to help accelerate construction of a 2,000-degree furnace in New Jersey that will extrude molten glass into lengths of medical-grade tubing hundreds of feet long. The tubes will be divided into vials and shipped out to be filled with vaccine.\u201cNo one wants to see glass be the reason the world can\u2019t get access,\u201d said Brendan Mosher, vice president and general manager of Corning Pharmaceutical Technologies. \u201cEveryone is working together and has a common goal to make sure there are plenty of vials.\u201dThe U.S. government also is seeking to ramp up domestic supply of syringes. BD, a global medical supply company based in New Jersey that is the largest supplier of syringes in the world, announced last week it is upgrading a factory in Nebraska with help from a $42 million contract with the government. BD already has a contract to sell 50 million syringes to the government. The company said the upgrade will allow it to produce hundreds of millions more syringes for \u201cpriority access\u201d by the U.S. government \u201cto support current and future pandemic efforts.\u201dADADThe Trump administration also awarded contracts of $53 million to a Texas company, Retractable Technologies, to expand its production capacity of syringes, and $138 million to ApiJect Systems, of Stamford, Conn., to boost capacity needed to manufacture 100 million pre-filled syringes.A coronavirus vaccine rooted in a government partnership is fueling financial rewards for company executivesStevanato Group, a global medical glassmaker based in Italy, and other manufacturers have estimated that worldwide demand will rise by 1 billion to 2 billion new glass vials, each capable of holding multiple vaccine doses, over the next two years.Stevanato has received an order from the global nonprofit Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) for 100 million vials that can contain enough vaccine for 20 doses each, enough for 2 billion shots. CEPI has said it is working with nine different companies in the hunt for an effective vaccine. It is investing millions of dollars in manufacturing upgrades for some of those companies to help them prepare ahead of time in the event their vaccines are effective.To get to \u201cherd immunity,\u201d the threshold where the coronavirus is no longer able to easily spread, as many as 5.6 billion of the world\u2019s 8 billion people will need to receive a vaccine. To be effective, a second booster shot a month or so later is likely to be needed for many of the vaccines under development. That means more than 11 billion individual doses may be needed to defeat the virus.The demand for vials has already begun because of the scientific community\u2019s speedy response to develop vaccines. Drugmakers including Johnson & Johnson, AstraZeneca, Merck, Moderna and Novavax \u2014 to name five that the Trump administration\u2019s Operation Warp Speed is supporting \u2014 are preparing to manufacture vaccine in large quantities and fill vials for shipping without even knowing whether their vaccines are effective.ADADThe White House and the Department of Health and Human Services have said hundreds of millions of doses are expected to be ready by the end of 2020. Many experts believe that is an overly optimistic timetable, considering it typically takes years to develop and test a vaccine.The U.S. government is already securing supplies of vials in anticipation of demand. It has signed contracts of $204 million with Corning and $143 million with an Alabama company, SiO2, which makes specialized plastic pharmaceutical vials that the company says withstand breakage and do not require manufacturing by using the extreme heat of a glass furnace.SiO2 will provide 120 million vials for U.S. domestic priorities by the end of 2020 and as many as 1 billion by April 2021 \u2014 which could satisfy a very large portion of the surge in global demand. The company recently announced a $163 million expansion of its manufacturing plant in Auburn, Ala. In March, SiO2 was running at a pace of 14 million vials per year. It expects to hit a pace of 120 million a year by December, Chief Business Officer Lawrence Ganti said.Doctors keep discovering new ways the coronavirus attacks the bodySiO2 has been able to tap into a strong desire by the Trump administration to make sure vital medical supplies are manufactured in the United States. The company is restricted from earmarking its government-backed production in Alabama to companies overseas, Ganti said.ADAD\u201cSeventy to 80 percent of medical glass is manufactured out of the United States, and they wanted to bring some of that back home,\u201d Ganti said. \u201cThey have priority over our distribution of that 120 million capacity. If a company wanted to use 120 million of those [outside the United States], we\u2019d say sorry.\u201dThree competing glass manufacturers in Europe \u2014 Stevanato Group, Gerresheimer and Schott \u2014 issued a joint statement last month that sought to assure the public that global demand for glass will be met.Stevanato has manufacturing plants in Italy, China, Brazil and Mexico, and it is considering building a new plant in the United States. In an interview, Stevanato chief executive Franco Stevanato declined to say what state was under consideration for U.S. production but that it probably would be near biopharmaceutical customers. The U.S. biopharmaceutical industry is concentrated in Boston and California, with additional hubs in New Jersey, Maryland and North Carolina.ADADOnce vials are filled by manufacturers, a challenge will be distributing volumes of coronavirus vaccine around the country and the world, steering them to viral outbreak hot spots and professions such as health-care workers and emergency responders where they are needed most.\u201cThe companies that are most prepared with infrastructure readiness, they are really the ones that are going to help save the day,\u201d said Anne Robinson, chief strategy officer for Kinaxis, a supply chain software company. \u201cThis is a really delicate situation, because once a vaccine is available, the demand is going to greatly exceed supply.\u201d", "comment": "0 Comments", "topic": "Business"}, {"cover": "", "title": "Why It Seems Like Everybody\u2019s Getting a State Bailout", "date": "Jul 2, 2020", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/energy/why-it-seems-like-everybodys-getting-a-state-bailout/2020/07/02/a936da9e-bc80-11ea-97c1-6cf116ffe26c_story.html", "keyword": "China and Security", "website": "the Washington Post", "author": "", "content": "In theory, the system of free trade driving the world economy is supposed to provide a level playing field for all.

Subscribe today.arrow-right1. What\u2019s state aid?It\u2019s when governments hand out support to key manufacturers or industries, which typically takes the form of cheap loans, tax breaks, contracts or direct subsidies. The idea is to give homegrown corporations an edge over outside competitors to create jobs, drive exports and fuel economic growth. Sometimes the state acquires partial ownership. Though aid can be modest, it attracts attention when it lasts for decades or drives the deliberate creation of dominant firms celebrated as \u201cnational champions.\u201dADAD2. What\u2019s wrong with a little help?It\u2019s a question of fairness, and about who gets to pick winners. There\u2019s also concern that governments may be supporting unviable \u201czombie\u201d companies, choking innovation and wasting money. Before the pandemic, Italy\u2019s repeated bank rescues raised hackles, while the U.S. and Europe have feuded for decades over support for rival planemakers Boeing Co. and Airbus SE. Under President Donald Trump, the U.S. sparked a trade war partly over accusations that China\u2019s subsidies created unfair competition for American firms. State support can fuel battles between places vying for jobs and investment; Ireland and Luxembourg became targets of European Union regulators for the low tax rates they charged Apple Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. respectively.3. Is state aid on the rise?ADADThe pandemic may be sweeping aside any pretense of restraint. For years, European leaders struggling with rising populism and competition from big Chinese firms wanted more leeway to act. Then the virus crisis drove governments and central banks to unleash waves of state assistance. While much of it preserved jobs and businesses economy-wide, other efforts were more targeted. The EU quickly relaxed curbs on cash injections and other support. Airlines around the world were rescued with offers of multi-billion dollar loans and job support packages. France provided funds to carmaker Renault SA and the aerospace industry, while Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV secured a loan to support its operations in Italy. The U.K. and Canada also pledged to step in. Germany put aside frugal traditions and unleashed a strategy to help key industries and promote local suppliers. Its $10 billion bailout of Deutsche Lufthansa AG will result in the government owning a 20% stake.4. Who\u2019s complaining?One regular voice of outrage is the chief executive officer of budget airline Ryanair Holdings Plc, Michael O\u2019Leary, who says state assistance for his rivals amounts to governments \u201cselectively gifting billions of euros to their inefficient flag carriers.\u201d Deep-pocketed Germany is showering firms with aid that debt-ridden Italy can\u2019t match, prompting calls for more fairness. To ensure weakened companies don\u2019t become easy prey, the EU is rewriting competition rules to restrict takeovers by foreign entities that may be receiving state aid. China\u2019s HNA Group Co., which shot to prominence by spending more than $40 billion on acquisitions across six continents starting in 2016, has become one of the biggest corporate casualties of the pandemic. China began assuming control of the debt-laden firm in March.ADAD5. Who keeps score?Institutions such as the World Trade Organization try to keep the peace by adjudicating state-aid spats. But there\u2019s plenty of scope for discord. Member states created a system for handling subsidies but left plenty of wiggle room for the nations to provide support. Since the U.S. paralyzed the WTO\u2019s appellate body in 2019, defendants can veto rulings by appealing them into a legal void. Meanwhile the U.S., Japan and the EU have been trying to work together to forge new subsidy rules for China. Policing state aid is also a cornerstone of the EU, which regulates Europe\u2019s vast free trade area known as the common market, home to almost 450 million consumers.6. Does state aid work?ADYes -- or there wouldn\u2019t be fights about it. Helping companies and creating jobs serves a political purpose; whether there\u2019s an economic benefit to aiding coal, steel or autos is harder to say. But there\u2019s a broad perception that having companies that can compete globally has powered exports in the U.S., South Korea, Japan and China. Bailouts of banks and big companies during the 2008 crisis rescued the global financial system and most loans were repaid, though they also created resentment about the use of taxpayer funds.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P.", "comment": "0 Comments", "topic": "Energy"}, {"cover": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/QOB4L5V4OAI6VF6BNTYRN77CNQ.jpghttps://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/QOB4L5V4OAI6VF6BNTYRN77CNQ.jpg", "title": "Which do you prefer: Trump\u2019s agenda or Biden\u2019s?", "date": "Jul 5, 2020", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/07/05/which-do-you-prefer-trumps-agenda-or-bidens/", "keyword": "China and Security", "website": "the Washington Post", "author": "Hugh Hewitt", "content": "The best commentators on the presidential race who are also partisans \u2014 and that includes about 99 percent of all reporters, hosts, analysts, in my view \u2014 should nonetheless be able to fairly articulate the motivations of each coalition backing either President Trump or former vice president  Joe Biden.Support our journalism.

If there is any doubt about that, consider a recent speech by Robert C. O\u2019Brien, in which the president\u2019s national security adviser declared, \u201cThe Chinese Communist Party is a Marxist-Leninist organization. The Party General Secretary Xi Jinping sees himself as Joseph Stalin\u2019s successor.\u201dADADAttorney General William P. Barr is a deeply intelligent, experienced and relentless force for the rule of law. Trump\u2019s supporters hope he oversees the rapid conclusion of U.S. Attorney John Durham\u2019s investigation into the interference with the peaceful transition of power after Trump\u2019s surprise 2016 win and a cleansing from government of those who refuse to honor the people\u2019s votes.Trump has pushed through a massive deregulation of the American economy, and his supporters want more of this shrinking of federal control.Support for Biden rests on many pillars. He is genuinely pleasant and amiable, a calm and welcoming presence. Many of his supporters simply yearn for an era of domestic good will, of reborn \u201ccivility,\u201d and believe Biden will be gracious and kind to all.ADBiden\u2019s supporters want taxes raised, significantly, to build infrastructure and to raise up long underserved Americans. Biden will defend and expand President Barack Obama\u2019s signature legislative achievement in health care. Biden\u2019s judges will be the opposite of Trump\u2019s, ready to leave the job of umpiring and eager to participate in a long overdue injection of their understandings of equality into American institutions. Biden judges will almost certainly see nothing wrong with the return of race-based rewards or in limiting the newly invigorated \u201cFree Exercise\u201d clause. The return of \u201cgoals and timetables,\u201d if not explicit quotas, will likely be assured. Reparations will not just be \u201con the table,\u201d they may wind up in law. Teacher unions expect a massive infusion of federal funding, and public employee unions generally expect the same for their beleaguered state-administered pension funds.Though Biden has said he is against it, his supporters may expect him to sign any bill that increases the number of Supreme Court justices, in a successful replay of Franklin D. Roosevelt\u2019s failed 1937 plan to pack the court. Indeed, most of Biden\u2019s supporters will want a new-millennium version of FDR, relentlessly experimenting with new agencies and programs, changing everything, often, in the name of social justice. His appointees will be from the left and the far left. This lurch to the left will be a feature, not a bug, as the Democratic coalition has moved well to the left of Bill Clinton\u2019s or Obama\u2019s supporters. A Green New Deal will be law, and the United States will rejoin the Paris Climate Agreement and the Europeans committed to reviving the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or Iran Deal. Trump\u2019s proposed peace plan for Israel and the Palestinian Authority will be withdrawn.ADBiden supporters hope he will use \u201csoft power\u201d to coax the People\u2019s Republic of China into renewed amicable relations with the West. They expect from Biden a return to national security administered, as it had been until Trump, by the standing, though informal, central committee of foreign policy grandees of New York and Washington.ADAmnesty for people in the country without permission will be a \u201cfirst 100 days\u201d goal for some and the hated border wall will likely be defunded or stopped. A Democratic Congress could impose universal voting by mail on the states in the name of ending voter suppression. That\u2019s a fair statement of the expectations of both coalitions on this weekend celebrating our shared freedoms. They should begin debating their visions across a stage, facilitated by fair moderators, soon.Read more:Jennifer Rubin: Biden\u2019s response to job numbers shows why he\u2019s leadingPaul Waldman: How Trump can win reelectionBill Weld: Please, Republicans, don\u2019t join Trump\u2019s crusade against voting-by-mailMichael Gerson: Trump surveyed the smoking ruin of his reelection and decided: Be more TrumpyHenry Olsen: President Trump, take a lesson from Mississippi ", "comment": "8.1k Comments", "topic": "Opinions"}, {"cover": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/OXTGPTGADUI6VCIINCRLT2XJ4A.jpghttps://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/OXTGPTGADUI6VCIINCRLT2XJ4A.jpg", "title": "U.S. Units of Chinese Companies Got American Bailout Funds", "date": "Jul 10, 2020", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/on-small-business/us-units-of-chinese-companies-got-american-bailout-funds/2020/07/07/8ab86830-c01d-11ea-8908-68a2b9eae9e0_story.html", "keyword": "China and Security", "website": "the Washington Post", "author": "", "content": "Chinese companies including conglomerate HNA Group Co. and affiliates of a state-owned defense giant were among recipients of the billions of dollars in coronavirus-relief loans handed out by the U.S. government.Support our journalism.

Citing security concerns, the U.S. has tried to constrain the global reach of Huawei Technologies Co. and moved to block Chinese wireless carriers from entering its home market.

Subscribe today.arrow-rightWhen analysts describe police militarization, they point out the Department of Defense\u2019s donation of military equipment to U.S. police forces, the development of military-style police training programs or the growth of paramilitary policing units like SWAT teams. To some critics, it\u2019s the U.S. global \u201cWar on Terror\u201d coming home to roost, with the training and materiel deployed around the world now ready for use against U.S. citizens.Does military equipment lead police officers to be more violent? We did the research.But the United States also exports policing techniques. In fact, the U.S. has been exporting policing techniques and technologies for more than a century, from constabulary training academies in Cuba and Panama at the turn of the 20th century to anti-communist police training programs during the Cold War.ADADThese programs have expanded over the past two decades. Much of this transfer of knowledge and technology involves Department of Defense and Department of State foreign police training programs. My research on these training programs not only charts their expansion, but also raises questions about whether the U.S. is contributing to the militarization of police forces worldwide.Who receives this police training?Although Congress restricted U.S. agencies\u2019 ability to train police abroad after the Cold War, police training became a focus of U.S. foreign policy in recent decades. In some cases, the expansion of U.S. police training reflects America\u2019s globalized response to the 9/11 attacks. But police professionalization and training also have become a cornerstone of various foreign policies \u2014 as part of U.N. peacekeeping missions, IMF loans, and as membership criteria for organizations like the European Union.ADADThe Defense Department and the State Department\u2019s yearly Foreign Military Training Report outlines all publicly available information on these security force training programs. While some information about foreign policing remains classified, especially information about training in NATO countries or other American allies, the available data show that U.S. funding for foreign police training expanded from $4.3 million in 2001 (the first year reliable data exists) to $146 million in 2018.Black people have protested police killings for years. Here\u2019s why officials are finally responding.Meanwhile, the number of countries receiving police training programs more than doubled, from 37 countries in 2001 to 91 in 2018. Although funding for police training is concentrated in Latin America, North Africa and Southeast Asia, there are some surprises. Most notably, the 2018 Foreign Training Report describes at least three programs that included police officers from Hong Kong and four programs that included police from Myanmar.Military education is often part of this trainingADADSo what is the U.S. teaching foreign police? According to the Foreign Training Report\u2019s data, police training courses vary from cybersecurity to crisis management. The majority of police training programs in 2018 fell into three categories: counterterrorism (15.6 percent), professionalization (15.6 percent) and technical training (21.9 percent).Much of the police training documented in the Foreign Training Report focuses on noncontroversial topics \u2014 like courses on anti-corruption or English language skills. Yet in select instances, the report indicates that foreign police receive military training as well. Without more public disclosure, it\u2019s difficult to determine whether these courses constituted serious military training or why this training was specifically needed.This training creates opportunities for police militarizationADADThe Foreign Military Training Report suggests various routes of militarization. For instance, foreign police sometimes train at U.S. military bases or military training facilities. Here\u2019s an example: Panamanian police reportedly received training alongside U.S. Air Force officers at Lackland Air Force Base. Similarly, police from Mauritius received officer training at a naval education facility in Pensacola, Fla.Moreover, the Foreign Training Report often refers to courses that police and militaries take together. Sometimes these involve classes like interministerial cooperation or statewide crisis management. In these cases, it makes sense that police would train alongside other forces.The Floyd protests have changed public opinion about race and policing. Here\u2019s the data.Yet not all these cases are as clear-cut. Colombian police, for instance, received joint operations training alongside members of the Colombian army and navy. Police in Indonesia, the Philippines and Nigeria similarly gained counterterrorism training alongside members of their country\u2019s armed forces. This type of cross-training may help police and military harmonize goals, but could create opportunities for the diffusion of a paramilitary mind-set, one that emphasizes the use of force, discretion from authority and mistrust of protesters.ADADWhy is this an issue? The data from these reports highlight potential areas where including police in military programs could effectively militarize the police. Research suggests that when police receive military training, or train alongside the military, they can be socialized into a militarized, warrior-like mind-set. Once police have a militarized mind-set, the distinction between an urban insurgent and a peaceful protester may blur, creating preconditions, at home and abroad, for crackdowns on free speech.Overall, then, most U.S. foreign police training appears noncontroversial. But the training of foreign police on U.S. military bases, often in military-oriented classes alongside members of the military, points to opportunities for foreign police militarization. Given policing\u2019s controversy in the U.S. today, these training programs highlight that the impact of American police training practices do not end at the water\u2019s edge.The TMC newsletter has moved!

The president has cast himself in the starring role of the blameless victim \u2014 of a deadly pandemic, of a stalled economy, of deep-seated racial unrest, all of which happened to him rather than the country.ADTrump put his self-victimization on public display Thursday in response to a Supreme Court ruling rejecting his claim of absolute immunity and permitting a New York prosecutor to see the president\u2019s private and business financial records.Trump reacted with a social media meltdown, writing on Twitter, \u201cPROSECUTORIAL MISCONDUCT!\u201d and \u201cPOLITICAL WITCH HUNT!\u201d He wrote that the decision was \u201cNot fair to this Presidency\u201d and claimed that \u201cCourts in the past have given \u2019broad deference\u2019. BUT NOT ME!\u201dADTrump has always exhibited a healthy ego and his self-victimization tendencies are not a new phenomenon, according to those who have known him over the years. But those characteristics have been especially pronounced this summer, revealing themselves almost daily in everything from private conversations to public tweets as the pandemic continues to upend daily life across America and threaten the president\u2019s political fortunes.ADBarbara Res, a former executive at the Trump Organization, said that when she worked for Trump, he interpreted nearly everything in deeply personal terms.\u201cWhatever bad happened, no matter what it was, it was always against him, always directed at him,\u201d Res said. \u201cHe would say, \u2018Why does everything always happen to me?\u2019\u2009\u201dShe added: \u201cIt was as if the world revolved around him. Everything that happened had an effect on him, good or bad.\u201dNow, however, Trump\u2019s sense of victimhood strikes even some allies as particularly incongruous considering the devastation wrought by the pandemic and the pain and anguish apparent in Black Lives Matter protests.ADMore than 130,000 Americans so far have died of the novel coronavirus, with more than 3 million cases reported. Nearly 43 million Americans \u2014 more than a quarter of the labor force \u2014 have filed for unemployment benefits since the pandemic began. And the nation is riven not just by protests following the death of George Floyd, the unarmed black man killed in Minneapolis police custody, but also by a president who has deliberately stoked racial animus.ADEven those in Trump\u2019s orbit are trying to nudge him toward a sunnier, less egocentric approach to the crises he is facing, fearing that his sullen demeanor could backfire politically. Among those internally who have advocated a more optimistic tone are Alyssa Farah, the White House communications director, and Jared Kushner, the president\u2019s son-in-law and senior adviser, according to one senior administration official.Trump increasingly preoccupied with defending his physical and mental healthOther top White House advisers \u2014 including Hope Hicks and Dan Scavino \u2014 have also sought to buttress Trump\u2019s mood with events they thought he would enjoy, such as celebrating truckers by bringing 18-wheelers onto the White House South Lawn in mid-April or creating social media videos that feature throngs of his adoring fans, according to aides.ADAdvisers also have sought to boost Trump\u2019s mood by presenting him internal polling that shows him in a better position than public surveys, which universally show him trailing presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden.One senior administration official rejected the notion that Trump views himself as a victim, saying instead that he has repeatedly expressed his frustration over a virus that seemed to emerge out of nowhere and has ravaged the country, and that his only concern is for the victims of the pandemic. A second official said that the president is most frequently speaking about how the country collectively has been victimized by the virus.ADThe first official added that Trump, as a former businessman, is especially well-suited for this unprecedented moment of crisis, and has demonstrated his management abilities by making the decision early on to shut down some travel from China and by waiving regulations to rush coronavirus therapeutics to the market.AD\u201cThe United States of America did not ask for this plague and every American has been affected from the closure of our economy to caring for the sick and mourning those tragically lost, but under the leadership of President Trump our Transition to Greatness has already begun, and the American people are showing tremendous courage to defeat the virus, responsibly open the economy, and restore law and order to our streets,\u201d White House spokesman Judd Deere said in an email statement. \u201cThe President\u2019s message has been consistent: resilience, hope, and optimism.\u201dStay safe and informed with our free Coronavirus Updates newsletterJen Psaki, former communications director in the Obama White House, agreed with private assessments that the president\u2019s complaining could be costly.AD\u201cI don\u2019t think he has many sympathetic ears to his claims that he\u2019s been mistreated,\u201d Psaki said. \u201cLeadership, as we\u2019ve seen at many moments in history, is about not only accepting adulation when you do something great but also accepting responsibility. That lack of accepting responsibility is seen as a lack of leadership and that doesn\u2019t sit well with people who might be more open to supporting him again.\u201dADAt times, though, Trump can\u2019t seem to help himself, said people who have spoken with him in recent weeks, describing him as shellshocked and sullen about his declining fortunes even as he continues to insist he will ultimately win in November.\u201cWe had the greatest economy in the world,\u201d Trump said in an Oval Office meeting last month, talking about how good the statistics were before the coronavirus, said one adviser. An outside adviser in frequent touch with the White House offered a similar recollection, saying that Trump simply keeps on repeating, \u201cI had this great economy and they made me shut it down.\u201dTrump and Biden campaigns shift focus to coronavirus as pandemic surgesAnother adviser who chatted with Trump about a month ago said the president opened with a lengthy rant expressing animus toward reporters \u2014 with Trump citing individual names of journalists and specific stories, particularly those about the coronavirus recovery. This person added that Trump also railed about pollsters being out to get him and deliberately sampling the wrong voters, and complained he was being blamed for protests that he had nothing to do with.A third outside adviser in frequent touch with the White House said that in a recent conversation, the president seemed almost \u201cinconsolable\u201d and summed up Trump\u2019s riff: Gripes about the great economy he built, now felled by the virus, and also how \u201csome stupid cop in Minneapolis kneels on someone\u2019s neck and now everyone is protesting.\u201dADADThe president has also complained to political advisers that the media blames him for the protests in the wake of Floyd\u2019s death, and that no matter what he says, \u201cit is not enough.\u201dTo some of his longtime advisers, the president has seemed tired, low-energy and lacking the passion and energy that defined him when he was a candidate during the 2016 race. Aides noticed he largely read his script at Mount Rushmore and did not veer off the teleprompters for high-energy riffs like he usually does when delivering political speeches.He has been spending an inordinate amount of time watching television news and has been scrambling for ways to fire up his base and keep his loyalists supportive, with little in the way of a set daily schedule.AD\u201cEvery guy that talks to him, the first half of the conversation is, \u2018Woe is me,\u2019\u2009\u201d said one of the outside operatives, speaking anonymously to share private details. \u201cThey\u2019re all saying, \u2018You\u2019ve got to snap out of it. You\u2019re the president. Presidents are supposed to deal with crises.\u2019 But he\u2019s fixated.\u201dADRuth Ben-Ghiat, a history professor at New York University and author of the forthcoming book, \u201cStrongmen,\u201d a history of authoritarian leaders, said Trump\u2019s victimization complex fits a pattern of authoritarian leaders past and present.\u201cThey have no empathy, and they only see the world through how things affect them personally,\u201d Ben-Ghiat said. \u201cThey\u2019re not there to govern. They\u2019re there to enrich themselves, they\u2019re there to plunder the nation, and they\u2019re there to be world historical.\u201dSome officials and advisers, however, say they are encouraged that Trump in recent days has gotten into a more optimistic mind-set, where he sees a path to victory and is ready to work toward it. The president just approved a calendar through the beginning of August that includes coronavirus-focused events, economic events and, they hope, a return to regular political events. Trump had planned to hold a campaign rally in an airport hangar in Portsmouth, N.H., on Saturday night, but it was postponed because of weather. The White House said it would be rescheduled for a week or two from now.June was a tough month for both the country and the president, the senior official said, but Trump\u2019s celebration in South Dakota in advance of July 4 represented something of an unofficial turning point, as aides hope the president will refocus on several top priorities.ADThe key themes for coming weeks, the official added, are rebuilding the nation\u2019s economy, continuing to fight the virus and continuing to secure communities, which will encompass the aftermath of the protests. There may also be some actions intended to show toughness against China.Trump \u2018white power\u2019 tweet set off a scramble inside the White House \u2014 but no clear condemnationThe president\u2019s mood had also improved as he focused on the fight over whether to rename or tear down statues named after Confederate generals and other controversial historical figures. Aides say he believes a battle over such symbols will help him politically.Despite his bouts of moroseness, Trump can also exhibit optimism not entirely grounded in reality. He has continued to tell advisers, for instance, that he is certain the virus will go away by October and that there will be a \u201ccure\u201d by then \u2014 a word he favors over \u201cvaccine.\u201dThen, he adds in these tellings, the economy will rebound overnight and he will win a second term.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "comment": "10k Comments", "topic": "Politics"}, {"cover": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/GIOMBGWIMAI6VMBX7FYR7CPOIY.jpghttps://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/GIOMBGWIMAI6VMBX7FYR7CPOIY.jpg", "title": "This spring, the virus made our decisions for us.

Our desire to follow through kept us busy revising plans even as the handwriting appeared on the wall. Only as Europe and the United States shut down did we see that the decision was out of our hands. The virus had decided for us.Support our journalism. Subscribe today.arrow-rightMore than four months later, despite all the world has experienced and learned about this pandemic, our country has circled back to that same mental space. This time, no one is talking about trips to Europe \u2014 the European Union has barred U.S. travelers \u2014 but there are other things we are eager to do, would love to do, have planned to do. Yet, even as we doggedly press ahead, it feels as though the virus is deciding otherwise.Exhibit A: Back to school. There are so many reasons the country wants to return to in-person learning. The economy needs it. Millions of parents can\u2019t get back to work until their children have someplace safe and constructive to spend their days. Justice demands it. Students in poverty have limited access to the computers and broadband necessary for virtual learning. The physical and mental health of young people depends on it. That\u2019s why the American Academy of Pediatrics \u201cstrongly advocates that all policy considerations for the coming school year should start with a goal of having students physically present in school,\u201d as the doctors said in a recent statement. \u201cThe importance of in-person learning is well-documented, and there is already evidence of the negative impacts on children because of school closures in the spring of 2020.\u201dADADBut returning safely to schools, colleges and universities was a formidable task even in spring, when the covid-19 trend lines looked as though they might turn favorable. In a paper published during the relatively optimistic days of May, John P.\u00a0Bailey and Jessica Schurz of the American Enterprise Institute noted that close to one-fifth of all teachers and more than 25\u00a0percent of principals in U.S. schools are over 55 and, therefore, at elevated risk of contracting covid-19. To reopen schools without driving mass retirements and resulting staff shortages would require \u201cimportant health precautions as part of containment strategies until a vaccine can be developed and safely deployed,\u201d they warned.\n[Full coverage of the coronavirus pandemic]\nAs we know, such precautions and strategies have been wanting. Egged on by our irresponsible president, many Americans have ignored pleas to mask up, wash up and keep a safe distance. The sadly predictable results are seen in a galloping spread of new infections. China sealed off the city of Wuhan in January when the known caseload there reached 1,300. Italy effectively quarantined 16 million people in March when its total case count reached 5,800. The United States has surpassed 70,000 new covid-19 cases .\u2009.\u2009. per day.ADADThat many of these cases are mild, or even asymptomatic, is a happy fact. But enough are severe to strain hospitals in many parts of the country \u2014 and that\u2019s before the approaching return of flu season, which will further tax health-care resources. People focused on the relatively low risk of serious illness among kids are missing a key point. Adults, too, are necessary to the education ecosystem; in fact, we need more of them to operate covid-safe schools. Those at elevated risk of death are looking at the wildfire spread of this disease, weighing the implications and, in many cases, concluding that they don\u2019t feel safe returning to their jobs as teachers, professors, coaches, school bus drivers, fraternity house managers, lunchroom cooks, custodians, security guards and administrators.Just as we saw in early March, harbingers are gathering. Two of the largest school districts in California have canceled in-person learning for another semester, and some smaller districts are following suit. Other jurisdictions have kicked the can, announcing delays to their reopening plans. The NCAA issued a warning that fall sports, including college football, may have to be scrapped.Keep in mind, the covid-19 recession is decimating state and local budgets that supply the majority of school funding. A promise of safe classrooms rings hollow without the money to pay for them. The Trump administration\u2019s bluster about cutting funds to schools that cannot open makes matters worse; talk of adding money for schools to a future relief package comes too late to save the semester.ADADThe United States had a chance to get covid-19 under control. Other countries are doing it. But with transmission unfettered and the traditional start of school drawing near, it looks as if we\u2019ve blown the opportunity and failed our kids. Their anger and depression will be justified if their classrooms are empty again this fall. I only hope they learn a lesson from our failure.\n\nRead more from David Von Drehle\u2019s archive.Read more:Molly Roberts: Anthony Fauci built a truce. Trump is destroying it.Leana S.

Subscribe today.arrow-rightTrump is not only using this right-wing information bubble to exploit his supporters. He also seems, increasingly, to have taken up residence there. As his failures have multiplied, his hold on political reality has loosened. Trump has become our boy in the bubble, with an intellectual immune system too weak for him to survive exposure to reality.ADADIn one sense, every president struggles with this temptation. All of them live in a world of high security, familiar advisers and a cocoon of deference. How can you really be wrong when they play \u201cHail to the Chief\u201d as you walk in the room? In most presidencies, this tendency is fought. Working with allies in the National Security Council and the State Department, I helped introduce President George W. Bush to a series of dissidents and human rights activists from Sudan, North Korea, China and elsewhere. Their stories touched Bush and focused his policymaking. At the White House, I sent Bush articles harshly critical of his foreign policy \u2014 which sometimes angered him but generally provoked discussion. This did not guarantee good results, but it enabled serious deliberation.Trump has systematically removed sources of dissent and critical thinking within his administration \u2014 people such as Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats. Sycophants now occupy those posts. From the start, the president expressed distrust for the U.S. intelligence services \u2014 even publicly preferring Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s word over their findings. Trump has recently disputed the views of government public health experts and tried to shift and sabotage their professional advice.For Trump, everything is politics, and all politics is personal. Disagreement with his impulses is taken as betrayal. Dissent is disloyalty.ADADSo what are the sources of truth and authority in the land of Trump? There is the cool rationality of right-wing Twitter. There is the wisdom of golfing buddies. There is a constant consumption and regurgitation of cable television. There is Tucker Carlson for advice on epidemiology, Jeanine Pirro on constitutional theory, Lou Dobbs on immigration policy, Sean Hannity to polish his shoes.We have entered a genuine crisis of truth. The president of the United States is allowing only inputs that reinforce his instincts. He is operating based on a set of views and assumptions that have no relation to the lives of Americans. The African American experience of injustice doesn\u2019t matter to him. The deaths of the elderly from a preventable disease don\u2019t register. The struggles of Americans in a disease-cursed economy are not even admitted. Instead, we get a huge helping of denial with a side of racism.Does Trump really think this is the path to reelection? Does he believe that most Americans will give him a pat on the back for a job well done? Yes, he appears to believe this. It is part of his delusion to believe it is always November 2016. Hillary Clinton is still his opponent. The polls are still weighted against him. The experts and doubters will again be humiliated. If only he stays the course of polarization and intolerance. If only he refuses to doubt his bigotry and his destiny.ADADBut Trump is not the strongman of his daydreams. In the real world of covid-19, racial injustice and economic suffering, his delusions are pathetic and dangerous. He combines the pretentions of a Caesar with the impulse control of a toddler. He is bound by his own compulsions and imprisoned by his own lies. The scent of his weakness is everywhere.Because Trump cannot listen, he will not change.

An introductory presentation of President Trump\u2019s successes or concerns. A spate of questions parried like Luke Skywalker deflecting blaster fire. Then an abrupt ending, often with a few prepared slides and talking points before she strides out the door.Support our journalism. Subscribe today.arrow-rightIt\u2019s that middle part where McEnany\u2019s extended stint as a cable-news pundit before joining the Trump administration is most obvious. In that job, she would sit down at a table in a television studio to fulfill her role as designated Donald Trump supporter, an iPad in front of her containing the points she intended to make on the appointed subject. She now approaches questions from the reporters as she would challenges from a fellow panelist, as necessarily aggressive and as an opportunity to score points rather to inform. And in service of those picayune scraps, she comes prepared not with an iPad but a thick binder of talking points she\u2019s prepared to offer on any given subject \u2014 regardless of whether those points actually address the reporter\u2019s question.ADADConsider an interaction from a news briefing on Thursday. McEnany was asked how Trump felt about the indictment of a Republican member of Congress on charges related to fraudulent voting, the sort of thing that would occupy a disproportionate amount of Trump\u2019s attention were it a Democrat. Instead of simply saying that she wasn\u2019t aware of Trump\u2019s position on the matter, which is fair enough even if it\u2019s a deflection in its own right, McEnany instead flipped through her binder. She might not have any comments about that incident, but she had a lot to say about fraud in general, listing a series of incidents aimed at presenting a hazy sense of risk about the process of voting by mail. (It was not terribly effective.)Reuters photographer Jonathan Ernst managed to snap a photo of the binder as McEnany was flipping through it, capturing an image of tabs indicating a number of different subjects that McEnany was prepared to address. Unlike when she was sitting on a set at CNN, where the network would give a heads-up about the topic being discussed, McEnany had to be prepared for anything. And so: more than 40 individual subjects, all labeled, all accessible with one precisely manicured finger flip.Here is each of the labeled tabs that were visible in Ernst\u2019s photo in order of appearance, and what each appears to mean. Some of these are our assumptions; if you have more insight, please email.ADADABSURD. The first tab is perhaps the vaguest. \u201cAbsurd\u201d is one of McEnany\u2019s favorite terms of art for questions from the press \u2014 \u201cWell, your first question is absolutely absurd,\u201d she said to a reporter on June 29, for example \u2014 but it\u2019s not entirely clear what might prompt her to flip to this particular page.BLM. Questions about the Black Lives Matter movement. In the past, for example, she has criticized the movement by quoting from an anti-police chant that was used at one rally five years ago.BALLOT. As a reporter asked McEnany about Rep. Steve Watkins (R-Kan.), the member of Congress who had been indicted, she listened to the question until the alleged voter fraud was mentioned. Then, as she began her answer, she flipped to the front of her binder and freestyled until she landed on her talking points.In this case, McEnany used her talking points to note that many mail ballots are rejected (a sign they are vetted for validity), that some ballots had been misprinted and that a mail truck containing ballots had caught fire.ADADThese, she said, were signs there was \u201crampant voter fraud\u201d with mail-in voting \u2014 which, again, wasn\u2019t the question. And which they aren\u2019t.CASES. Presumably data on the number of new cases recorded in the coronavirus pandemic. This didn\u2019t come up on Thursday.CDC. An employee of the aggressively pro-Trump One America News asked a question about the reliability of data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, giving McEnany an opportunity to flip to the CDC tab and articulate the surveillance mechanisms the government uses to track the spread of the pandemic.CHINA. Obviously myriad possibilities for the contents of this tab. McEnany did flip to it in response to a question, but simply stated that the White House had no announcements to make about potential bans on travel by the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party.ADADCOVID. During a briefing earlier this month, a reporter asked about the increase in hospitalizations as new coronavirus cases surged.\u201cI\u2019m glad that you asked about covid,\u201d McEnany replied, referring to covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, \u201cbecause I do want to take a moment to highlight some of the things that the federal government has done.\u201dWhich is how this whole process works.It\u2019s worth noting that, while there was an overarching \u201cCOVID\u201d tab on Thursday, there were also individual tabs focused on aspects of the response to the disease. That included the two tabs that followed \u201cCOVID,\u201d each identified with a superimposed red sticker.AD[M]ORTA. The visible part of the first sticker read \u201cORTA,\u201d almost certainly meaning that it focused on the MORTAlity rate of the virus.With new cases climbing several weeks before the number of covid-19 deaths did, the administration has of late focused on mortality rate \u2014 that is, the number of deaths relative to the number of cases. More cases and fewer deaths means a lower mortality rate, which means a better metric for the White House to use.ADAs deaths continue to rise, though, that metric will become less politically useful.TEST. Another red-sticker tab, referring to testing for the virus. McEnany flipped to it in response to a question about slow turnaround times for new tests. Her response, apparently read from the binder, focused on how much testing the United States has done relative to other countries and the number of test sites that had been established in \u201ccounties with moderate to high social vulnerability.\u201dADDEFUND. The administration has sought to to elevate calls for defunding police departments as an attack on Trump\u2019s political opponents, an effort for which McEnany was certainly prepared. So far, Americans broadly understand the slogan to mean a demand that police departments change how they operate, not generally that the departments be disbanded entirely.ADDACA. Talking points focused on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals policy implemented by Barack Obama. The policy allowed people who\u2019d come to the country illegally as children a way to live in the U.S. legally. Trump has opposed the policy and attempted to undercut it. Earlier this week, a court ordered the administration to accept new applications for the program, but it has refused to do so.EARLY. It\u2019s not clear what this refers to though it might be a reference to early voting.ADECON. Presumably for questions about the economy. The administration has repeatedly celebrated record monthly gains in new employment, records that occurred thanks to the sharp drop in employment that accompanied efforts to contain the virus.ELECTION. McEnany\u2019s standard response for political questions she doesn\u2019t want to answer (such as about Trump\u2019s sagging poll numbers) is to direct questioners to the campaign. It\u2019s not clear, then, what specifically this refers to.ADFAU[CI]. In recent days, tension between members of the administration and the government\u2019s leading infectious-disease expert, Anthony S. Fauci, has become public. Trump\u2019s top trade official, Peter Navarro, attacked Fauci\u2019s credibility in an op-ed published by USA Today, an attack that Trump had blessed, according to later reporting.ADFLYNN. For questions about Michael Flynn, Trump\u2019s first national security adviser who left the administration after only a few weeks. He was later indicted as part of Robert S. Mueller III\u2019s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. Despite his admission of guilt, the Justice Department sought to have the charges against him thrown out.GOLF. Trump\u2019s frequent golf-playing has conflicted with his pre-election criticisms of Barack Obama for his own golf habit. Over the weekend, Trump defended his frequent trips to the course as being a form of exercise and claimed that he has played less often than Obama did.ADHe has played far more often and almost always at properties that generate personal income for himself.GOYA. A White House visit by the chief executive of Goya Foods Inc. prompted backlash among Trump\u2019s critics. The company is heavily reliant on Hispanic American customers, and Hispanic Americans are heavily critical of Trump\u2019s presidency. The backlash spurred a counterbacklash, which included Trump himself posing at the venerable Resolute Desk in the Oval Office, giving a thumbs up to several Goya products.HATCH. That promotion and Trump\u2019s campaign-rally-style remarks from the Rose Garden earlier this week raised questions about the Hatch Act, a law that prohibits using government resources for campaigning.\u201cCan you talk about your understanding of what the White House policy is for this White House as far as politics?\u201d a reporter asked on Thursday, citing the Rose Garden comments.\u201cWe act in accordance with the Hatch Act,\u201d McEnany replied. \u201cIt\u2019s well established that the president and vice president are not subject to the Hatch Act.\u201dAfter a bit more on the law, the reporter followed up.\u201cThat\u2019s not my question,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Hatch Act has nothing to do with this.\u201dPerhaps not, but that was something McEnany was prepared to talk about.HATE. A vague reference with no clear antecedent in the current news environment.HEALTH. Presumably for questions about Trump\u2019s personal health. There has been a swirl of questions about Trump in recent months, including about his risk from the coronavirus and blowback from his focus on the mental capacity of his likely general election opponent, former vice president Joe Biden.HOGAN. In an op-ed for The Post, Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan (R) criticized Trump\u2019s handling of the pandemic.McEnany was prepared for questions about him, flipping to the \u201cHOGAN\u201d tab and noting various occasions \u2014 March 19, April 18 \u2014 when Hogan had praised the federal response.KARL. Perhaps a reference to ABC News\u2019s Jonathan Karl, who, in another Post op-ed, criticized McEnany herself for the way in which she approached press briefings.\u201cThe White House press secretary\u2019s job differs fundamentally from that of a spokesperson for a candidate or political party,\u201d Karl wrote. \u201cThe White House press secretary serves at the pleasure of a president but is also a public servant whose salary is paid by taxpayers. The job is to inform the public: to be an intermediary between the president and a press corps the public relies on for information....\u201d\u201cDenying reality and using the White House podium for purely political purposes is a violation of public trust,\u201d he wrote.On Thursday, McEnany was prepared with talking points to rebut him, should the issue have come up.LGBT. An umbrella for questions about gay and transgender issues.Earlier this week, there was a question posed to McEnany about Trump\u2019s 2019 tweet banning transgender individuals from serving in the military.\u201cI haven\u2019t talked to him about that specific policy,\u201d McEnany replied \u2014 then pivoted to her talking points. \u201cBut this president is proud that, in 2019, we launched a global initiative to end the criminalization of homosexuality throughout the world.\u201d And so on.LIES. An evocative label for information being offered by a press secretary, to be sure.It\u2019s possible that this tab included talking points meant to rebut The Post\u2019s determination earlier this week that Trump had made at least 20,000 false or misleading statements as president. We don\u2019t call all of those statements lies, but it is certainly a succinct way of referring to the subject.MARY. Presumably Mary L. Trump, the president\u2019s niece whose new book about the family has become a bestseller.MASKS. Another coronavirus-related topic. Over the weekend, the president posed for cameras while wearing a face mask for the first time, which may be why the subject was included in McEnany\u2019s notes.Or, perhaps, it included talking points about CDC Director Robert Redfield\u2019s comment this week that we could shut down the spread of the virus in a month or two. The White House position has been not that Americans should wear masks but, instead, that they should follow the lead of local officials \u2014 a position that has at times proven awkward for administration officials.MEDIA. McEnany revels in using anecdotal examples of media outlets having to correct stories as a way to undercut trust in their broader reporting. She has repeatedly rattled off similar examples at past briefings, suggesting that this particular tab is well-worn.\u201cI really think that it\u2019s time for the New York Times to step back and ask themselves why they\u2019ve been wrong \u2014 so wrong, so often,\u201d she said on June 29, for example, then listing a number of things she asserted the newspaper had been incorrect about.MEULLER [sic]. Trump\u2019s decision to commute the sentence of his longtime adviser Roger Stone prompted the former special counsel to write an op-ed for The Post reinforcing Stone\u2019s guilt on the charges he faced. While the tab may have included broader talking points about the Mueller probe, it likely also focused on Mueller\u2019s essay.OBAMA. Another broad category. It may have included a point McEnany threw out at the end of the briefing on Thursday, accusing the Obama administration of prematurely halting testing during the H1N1 pandemic in 2009. That halt, though, came under vastly different circumstances during the spread of a vastly less dangerous virus. It also marked a transition to a different sort of data collection.PPE. Presumably data on the government\u2019s production of personal protective equipment for addressing the pandemic. The administration frequently cites numbers about the supply of masks and gowns because of the scale: millions produced and supplied. There have nonetheless been recent reports of shortages in hard-hit areas of the country.PRIVIL. Likely shorthand for questions about the application of executive PRIVILege by the White House.REOPEN. Talking points on the president\u2019s push to reopen the economy after the coronavirus lockdown. The rush to get back to business encouraged by Trump led many states to skip over recommended benchmarks aimed at preventing a resurgence of the virus.RUSSIA. Another broad category, though with at least two topical applications in the moment.The first concerns recent reports about Russia offering bounties to Taliban fighters for killing American troops, a subject that has come up repeatedly in recent weeks, including in late June. (These notes likely include McEnany\u2019s standard response: Those reports are unconfirmed.) The second is that this week marked the second anniversary of Trump\u2019s meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Finland.SCHEDUL. Presumably the president\u2019s daily schedule for reference.SCHOOL. Above, we noted that \u201cREOPEN\u201d likely referred to reopening the economy precisely because this tab probably refers to Trump\u2019s recent push to get schools to reopen this fall.As soon as a reporter mentioned schools during Thursday\u2019s briefing, McEnany\u2019s eyes darted to the appropriate tab, and she flipped to that page, though her response was broad.She flipped to it again later when asked what Trump would say to parents about the risk of reopening. She offered quotes from experts and noted studies about the limited risk to children (though not to school staff).SHAR[?]. A partially obscured tab. (Think you know what it was? Email us. Reader suggestions: SHARpie, SHARia, SHARpton.)STATUES. Trump has focused heavily on the protection of memorials around the country, seeing the issue as a way of casting his political opponents as foes of American history. This tab likely included talking points centered on defending Trump\u2019s position.STONE. Presumably information about the Stone commutation and criticism of the investigation that led to his arrest and conviction.SYSTEM. Another vague, unclear tabs. (Think you know what it is? Email us. The most common reader suggestion: SYSTEMic racism.)UNIVER. As a reader noted, this may refer to a subset of school reopenings: universities welcoming students back this fall, or not. Several schools have announced specific plans aimed at limiting the spread of the virus.It may also include information about the administration\u2019s brief flirtation with rescinding visas for foreign students enrolled in U.S. universities which were only conducting classes online. After causing a furor as college scrambled to figure out how it might apply to their students, the policy was not put into effect.WINS. The Trump administration likes to tout its successes, generally presenting its accomplishments as the endpoint of possible achievement. Trump himself has often listed a number of things he argues show his presidency as historically successful. There\u2019s every reason to believe that McEnany was prepared to do the same if needed.Those were all of the subjects visible on Thursday.There\u2019s one point, though, that bears repeating about McEnany\u2019s tab-based approach to fielding questions. It is the case that some of the information contained in her binder is useful and directed to natural inquiries from the media. It is also the case that much of the information and, in fact, many of the subjects for which she was prepared were simply intended to inject talking points into the discussion and/or to pull a bit of political judo. You want to talk about an indicted Republican? Well, let\u2019s talk about a mail truck catching fire.Earlier this month, McEnany ended her briefing the way Thursday\u2019s began, talking about crime in U.S. cities.\u201cYou know,\u201d she complained, \u201cI was asked probably 12 questions about the Confederate flag. This president is focused on action, and I\u2019m a little dismayed that I didn\u2019t receive one question on the deaths that we got in this country this weekend.\u201dShe rattled off some statistics that she presented as bolstering her case. She came prepared to win the argument, even if she had to gin up the argument herself.", "comment": "647 Comments", "topic": "Politics"}, {"cover": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/CNIBJRF64YI6VN62LAB3FFHENU.jpghttps://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/CNIBJRF64YI6VN62LAB3FFHENU.jpg", "title": "Elegant but unproven, RNA experiments leap to the front in coronavirus vaccine race.

Subscribe today.arrow-rightThis promising \u2014 but unproven \u2014 new generation of vaccine technologies is based on deploying a tiny snip of genetic code called messenger RNA to trigger the immune system. It has never before been approved for use.But almost overnight, these cutting-edge RNA vaccine efforts have leaped forward as top candidates to fight covid-19. Some developers plan to have tens of millions of doses ready by the end of the year.Elegant in theory, efficacious in the laboratory but untested in the real world, the possible RNA vaccines are especially attractive because they might be cheaper, easier and faster to manufacture on a massive scale \u2014 at least one team boasts it could partner with producers in developing countries to provide millions of vials for as little as $5 a pop.Brazil, ravaged by coronavirus, becomes testing ground for vaccine pushMore than 150 possible vaccines are now being developed by multinational pharmaceutical companies, academic groups and government laboratories around the world, many employing traditional protocols used to make flu and other vaccines for decades.ADADAt least 17 teams are now testing their potential vaccines in humans \u2014 and at least five of these are betting on RNA vaccines.The RNA group has been among the first out of the gate because they can be rapidly designed on computers, using just the genetic sequence of the coronavirus that was shared online in early January.Big risk, big rewardsThe stakes, and risks, are enormous.\u201cThis is the greatest science experiment in vaccinology that\u2019s ever been done,\u201d said Andrew Ward, a structural biologist at the Scripps Research Institute in San Diego. \u201cIt\u2019s literally testing all the different technologies, and it\u2019s going to be cool to see how this all shakes out.\u201dADThe RNA vaccines under study come from a small laboratory at Imperial College London, from the People\u2019s Liberation Army Academy of Military Sciences in China, from three large pharmaceutical companies \u2014 Pfizer, Moderna and CureVac \u2014 and their partners.ADThey\u2019re competing alongside groups pursuing a slew of other methods, including the use of inactivated or killed virus or bits of the virus \u2014 a traditional strategy used against seasonal flu and other pathogens. Others harness harmless viruses to ferry distinctive pieces of the coronavirus machinery into cells.Mapping the pandemic around the worldThough never deployed in humans outside of clinical trials, the RNA research is being backed by hundreds of millions of dollars in investment, fueled by the urgency to crack the covid code. Each team is seeking the prize of being first to a vaccine, while guaranteeing their own populations will get early access.ADIt\u2019s a high-wire, high-price gamble on 21st-century, computer-aided medicine.Among the first to begin human trials is a self-amplifying RNA vaccine developed by the British professor Robin Shattock, 57, who in his college days at North East Surrey College of Technology, wasn\u2019t very good at math or science and thought maybe he\u2019d like to be a rock star instead.Human trials underwayWithin days of the novel coronavirus emerging in Wuhan, China, and its genetic sequence being published, Shattock and his small team at Imperial College London went to work.ADIn January, February and March, Shattock couldn\u2019t get his telephone calls answered by top British officials. He spent days of precious lab time applying and cajoling for funding to move his vaccine candidate forward, allies said.ADThen Britain\u2019s health secretary, Matt Hancock, decided to back Shattock and his potential vaccine, and $50 million poured in.In the past week, at an anonymous clinic in west London that cannot be named for security reasons, the first nine volunteers got a jab from the Imperial College vaccine.\u201cThey seem to have responded well,\u201d Shattock said.How health specialists deal with the nonstop risksAn additional 300 volunteers will receive the dose over the summer. Imperial College hopes to launch a 6,000-person trial in October.\u201cWe think that just around the corner there will be a sea change in the way that vaccines are developed and manufactured,\u201d Shattock told The Washington Post. \u201cI think we\u2019re just on the cusp of that.\u201d\u00a0ADADIf all goes well, a U.S. trial of the first potential RNA vaccine will enter the crucial third phase to measure how well it protects against infection and sickness this month. It\u2019s the gold standard of double-blind controlled studies involving thousands of volunteers in multiple countries. Half get the candidate vaccine, and half get a placebo.All the potential vaccines share a common aim: to teach the immune system to recognize and neutralize the coronavirus. Newer approaches use genetic material such as RNA or DNA to turn the body\u2019s cells into miniature vaccine factories.Genetic code sharedSome of the possible vaccines are breaking speed records.ADScientists were able to use the genetic sequence shared by researchers in China on Jan.\u00a010 to design possible vaccines on a computer before the coronavirus causing a mysterious pneumonia even had a name.ADThe Imperial College researchers took just two weeks to identify the bit of genetic material they wanted to deploy to attempt to trigger an immune response.The leading American effort, an RNA vaccine being developed by the Massachusetts biotechnology company Moderna, went from a genetic sequence on a computer screen to a shot in the arm of a person in an unprecedented 66 days.Leaders of Inovio Pharmaceuticals, a Pennsylvania company working on a possible vaccine that uses DNA, have said it took three hours to design.ADThe idea of deploying RNA to fight infectious diseases and cancer has tantalized scientists for years. But they have yet to move beyond the experimental stage.Each vaccine technology has advantages and trade-offs \u2014 the speed and flexibility of the RNA platform balanced against the lack of experience in using it in large human populations.ADVaccines that might take longer to make could offer a stronger immune response.The usefulness of some vaccines could be limited in the developing world if they require extensive refrigeration. Questions remain about how long any of the potential vaccines might be effective and whether people might need booster shots.No 'single silver bullet'\u201cNo one thinks there\u2019s going to be a single silver bullet,\u201d said Deborah Fuller, a microbiologist at the University of Washington.ADThat\u2019s because multiple treatments might be needed to meet the number of doses required around the world \u2014 and it\u2019s likely that vaccines will have different profiles.The fastest to be developed might not be the most effective. One might work better in older people than in the young, or vice versa.\u201cAs a collective team, they\u2019re going to be able to battle this pandemic together,\u201d Fuller said.The RNA technology being tested in human volunteers is promising, but questions remain about safety, whether it works and how long it might last.AD\u201cI don\u2019t think we know,\u201d said Peter Jay Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine. \u201cIt\u2019s a brand-new technology, and we\u2019ve not really had large numbers of [vaccinated] people walking around for years.\u201dPharmaceutical giant Pfizer and the German firm BioNTech are testing four RNA vaccine candidates in a clinical trial and reported results from one of them this month. It uses a modified strand of RNA that codes for the spike protein found on the surface of the coronavirus, with a tweak to its genetic code to increase its ability to trigger an immune response.Such modifications \u201ctry to get the right balance between stimulating the innate immune response, but not stimulating it so much you shut down the RNA\u2019s ability\u201d to create the spike protein, said William Gruber, senior vice president of Pfizer Vaccine Clinical Research.Vaccine 'factory' in cellsThe Pfizer results, shared in a preprint article that has not been peer-reviewed, showed that an RNA-based formula was safe at low doses and triggered a stronger immune reaction in people who were vaccinated than in those recovering from a natural infection. Pfizer plans to test at least one of its possible RNA vaccines in a 30,000-person clinical trial by the end of the July, pending regulatory approval.ADThe hoped-for\u00a0RNA vaccines being tested by some of the groups mean a smaller dose could be extremely potent \u2014 which could mean people might need only a single dose.The technology could also decrease the amount of genetic material needed in the future vaccine, making manufacturing more efficient.Shattock said one liter of his RNA reaction \u2014 about four cups\u2019 worth \u2014 can make at least 2\u00a0million doses of possible vaccine. Other vaccine models require thousands of liters to make the same number of doses.One of Pfizer\u2019s candidates is a self-amplifying RNA vaccine.\u201cOnce you inject it into a human being, it gets taken up by a cell, and it\u2019s like its own factory \u2014 it amplifies itself in the cell,\u201d Kathrin Jansen, head of vaccine research and development at Pfizer, said in May, when human trials began. \u201cOne copy goes in, and the factory starts kicking in and making more and more copies.\u201dIf the self-amplifying RNA vaccine is successful, Jansen said, it could allow the company to use a much smaller dose \u2014 and radically change the company\u2019s predictions about how much vaccine it could manufacture next year.Pfizer has not chosen which of its four vaccines it will scale up, but has said that next year it will manufacture 1.2\u00a0billion doses.\n\n\n\nJohnson reported from Boulder, Colo.Coronavirus vaccine developers have a \u2018bizarre\u2019 problem.

And its growing budget uncertainty could be a warning sign for other red states such as Arizona and Florida where already spiking cases have led to the the reversal of some economic reopening plans and a dampening of confidence among residents increasingly wary about returning to normal life in the new coronavirus epicenters.\u00a0Texas \u201cwitnessed a $650 million drop in tax revenue collected in June, according to data released Wednesday by state budget officials, which includes sales mostly made in May. Texas leaders attributed the decline to consumers shelling out less for cars, gasoline, alcohol and other goods, as well as precipitous drops in travel and tourism, compared with the same period a year earlier,\u201d Tony Romm reports.\u201cTax collections in Texas in the meantime are down by roughly $5.7 billion over the past four months of the pandemic, according to a Washington Post analysis of state budget records, compared with the same March-to-June period in 2019. A significant portion of the gap is attributed to the fact that Texas delayed the filing date for some business franchising taxes until July.\u201dTexas is also dealing with shocks to the energy industry: \u201cThe state\u2019s most lucrative revenue stream, sales taxes, plummeted more than $200 million between mid-May and mid-June, falling roughly 6.5 percent compared with collections in June 2019, state budget officials said,\u201d my colleague writes. \u201cThe decline came partly in response to \u2018steep drops in remittances from oil- and gas-related sectors,\u2019 Glenn Hegar, the comptroller, said in a statement.\u201d\u00a0What's particularly concerning is the shortfall was mostly related to sales in May.Texas began reopening in mid-April, but cases didn't really begin to spike until last month. This probably means July's numbers will be worse.\u00a0Gov. Greg Abbott (R) has paused reopening plans, shutting down bars and scaling back restaurant dining as cases hit records and hospitalizations soar. Meanwhile, health-care officials in Houston, the state's largest city, project that hospital space could run out in a matter of weeks.The state does have one big advantage: \u201cUnlike many states, Texas entered the economic crisis with healthy cash reserves of roughly $11 billion, allowing state officials perhaps to avoid some of the more painful cuts and tax increases pursued by other locales,\u201d my colleague writes.ADADBut even that won't protect Texans from budget cuts: \u201cAbbott in May still asked most state agencies to calculate 5 percent reductions in their budgets, a sign that even localities in a strong fiscal position may suffer if the downturn proves protracted.\u201dThat should be a red flag for other states.\u00a0\u201cEven the states that are really well run are being really overwhelmed by the level of downturns they are going to see in terms of revenues,\u201d Dan White, the director of government consulting and fiscal policy research at Moody's Analytics, told my colleague.\u00a0What that means: \u201cThe public sector has shed more than 1 million jobs since the crisis began, as these governments slash their staffs to balance their unsettled budgets, according to Labor Department data released Thursday. Federal indicators show that states in particular shed roughly 25,000 jobs just last month, even as other hard-hit sectors began the slow path to recovery.\u201dState aid will likely remain a flash point in stimulus talks on the Hill.The \u201ccongressional effort to authorize an additional $1 trillion in state and local support, which House Democrats have already adopted, has received little traction among Republican leaders in the Senate even as negotiations continue on a new emergency coronavirus relief package,\u201d my colleague writes. \u201cGOP lawmakers are skeptical about additional spending, with some suggesting along with [Trump] that only states led by Democrats are in need of direct federal help. Others contend the best solution is to repurpose existing dollars so cities and states can spend them more easily.\u201d\u00a0ADADEven Texas's own lawmakers say more assistance isn't the answer: \u201cWhat I hear back home is that our states and cities don\u2019t need more money, they need the flexibility to be able to spend it where they need it,\u201d Rep.

Ted Cruz (R), told my colleague that the senator is also skeptical of additional local aid.At the White House, the hope is tax cuts and stimulus checks can make a difference in the broader economic uncertainty.Trump affirmed yesterday he's in favor of another round of direct payments to Americans, but it's unclear how much he those checks should be for and how many people should receive them.

Subscribe today.arrow-rightThe fight over the F-1 visas follows a June executive order by President Trump blocking visas for temporary foreign workers, including H-1B visas for those with specialized skills. Business leaders and immigration advocates remain critical of the suspension of H-1B visas.Tuesday\u2019s Rose Garden news conference remarks by Trump suggest immigration matters remain at the top of the White House agenda. But what\u2019s the real relationship between immigrants and U.S. economic development?Trump wants to limit immigration to protect jobs. Will that work?The administration says these rules put Americans firstDozens of schools and state officials had balked at the F-1 plan, citing the need for online education in the face of the continued threat of covid-19 transmission. The administration\u2019s reversal on F-1 visas came after 19 states, the District of Columbia and a number of U.S. universities initiated lawsuits to block the rule.ADADThe administration defended the new student visa rules by saying they would \u201cencourage U.S. schools to reopen\u201d this fall, which would be good for American students, families and the national economy. The president similarly justified the suspension of H-1B visas for overseas workers with special skills by arguing they represented \u201can unusual threat\u201d in taking away jobs and hampering the economic recovery.The U.S. has long attracted skilled immigrantsOver 50 years ago, the landmark Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 increased immigration rates and replaced an older quota system that gave preference to white, northern Europeans. The new law prioritized immigration visas for three groups: refugees, those with close ties to family already legally established in the U.S. and foreign nationals with special skills or training.ADADThus, for more than half a century, the premise of U.S. immigration policy has been admitting foreign businesspeople, students, scientists and technicians based on merit and ability, rather than race and cultural familiarity promotes U.S. education, industry and economic performance.What\u2019s the evidence that immigrants contribute to the economic development of the United States? MIT, for instance, owes much of its success as a premier research and teaching institution to the talents of its foreign-born teachers, technicians, researchers and students. More than 43 percent of the MIT faculty were born outside the U.S. Almost 100 alumni, faculty and researchers affiliated with the university have won Nobel Prizes \u2014 within this group, more than one-third were foreign born.The Trump administration is curtailing visas for Chinese scientists. That could backfire.Across U.S. universities, foreign-born researchers and teachers are concentrated in high-growth STEM fields. A Congressional Research Service report reveals almost a quarter of all STEM undergraduates and about half of all STEM graduate students are foreign-born, many of whom will remain in this country and work after graduation. Without students and workers from outside the U.S., it\u2019s difficult to see how the current successes of U.S. scientific research and innovation could continue.Immigrants fuel innovationImmigrants in universities are not only integral to the U.S. learning and teaching environment, but they are also central in U.S. academic and business leadership, training a new generation of researchers and professionals.ADADConsider the National Academy of Sciences, arguably the most prestigious U.S. professional organization in the sciences. Annually, the NAS elects a select group of the nation\u2019s most distinguished scientific scholars, with the stipulation that these researchers must be American citizens. Over a recent six-year period, one-third of NAS inductees were foreign-born, hailing from nations as diverse as China, Guatemala, Hungary, Iran, South Africa, Syria, Turkey and Vietnam.Immigrants have become fixtures in innovation hubs like Boston and Silicon Valley and leaders in their fields. One recent report found immigrants have started more than half of America\u2019s start-ups valued at $1 billion or more. The U.S. Patent Office reports inventors born outside the U.S. file about half of the hundreds of thousands of new patents each year.Are U.S. jobs at stake? Research and government studies don\u2019t support the president\u2019s claims that these foreign workers take jobs away from native-born Americans. The H1-B visa program halted by the president is designed to attract essential skills and training in short supply in the U.S. labor pool. The supply of employer-sought high-skill workers is often concentrated in specific global regions, leading to employee shortfalls. Thus, as the Brookings Institution has reported, while more than half of the world\u2019s engineering degrees are earned in Asia, just 4 percent of the global total are issued to U.S. students. The H1-B program helps correct this disjuncture between supply and demand.ADADIn fact, the president\u2019s H1-B executive order recognizes foreign workers are essential. It directs administration officials to create rules exempting immigrants critical to our security needs, those conducting research to help the nation \u201ccombat COVID-19\u201d and anyone facilitating \u201cthe immediate and continued economic recovery of the United States.\u201dThe TMC newsletter has moved! Sign up here to keep receiving our smart analysis.While the link between H1-B workers and business and research innovation seems clear enough, the American system of higher education is also dependent upon foreign students for its financial survival. An open secret in universities is that international students pay more than their classmates to study in the United States, effectively subsidizing education for U.S. students. Here\u2019s an example: In four-year public institutions, the average international student pays almost three times the in-state tuition amount.In an era of state budget cuts to higher education \u2014 not to mention the uncertainties of fall enrollments clouded by the coronavirus \u2014 the boost from international students is especially important. According to the Department of Commerce, international students contributed almost $45 billion to U.S. GDP in 2018, and helped create or support over 450,000 U.S. jobs.ADADThis fall offers an uncertain road for millions of students, workers and employers whose lives have been disrupted by the covid-19 pandemic. But the track record of U.S. universities, businesses and economic innovation suggests foreign-born students, teachers, doctors and Nobel laureates would continue to contribute to the route forward.Bruce Peabody is professor of government and politics at Fairleigh Dickinson University and the co-author of a forthcoming book on the political theory of death.Harvey Lodish is a founding member of the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research and professor of biology and biological engineering at MIT.", "comment": "26 Comments", "topic": "Monkey Cage"}, {"cover": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/T4YEHKX4CQI6THQCDVC4WPP2R4.jpghttps://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/T4YEHKX4CQI6THQCDVC4WPP2R4.jpg", "title": "Trump ignores the history of nuclear weapons at our peril", "date": "Jul 16, 2020", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2020/07/16/president-trump-ignores-history-nuclear-weapons-our-peril/", "keyword": "China and Security", "website": "the Washington Post", "author": "", "content": "As we mark the 75th anniversary of the atomic bomb, we may be headed into a new arms race with Russia and China following President Trump\u2019s plans to resume nuclear testing. According to a Washington Post report, the Trump administration has been holding discussions on carrying out nuclear test explosions for the first time since 1992.Support our journalism. Subscribe today.arrow-rightThis news alarmed presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, who stated, \u201cThe possibility that the Trump administration may resume nuclear explosive weapons testing in Nevada is as reckless as it is dangerous.\u201dIt\u2019s vital that we remember our responsibility as the first nation to test a nuclear weapon to lead the world in controlling and ultimately eliminating them. In fact, this idea has been embedded in nuclear policy since the beginning.ADThere was a real fear that Nazi Germany would develop an atomic bomb first, and the Manhattan Project began a race during the war to make sure that did not happen. There was also increasing alarm about the potential of a postwar world with nuclear weapons in the hands of many, recognizing the inevitability of this dangerous technology eventually reaching the Soviet Union and others. Secretary of War Henry Stimson warned President Harry Truman about the danger of other nations and even rogue groups developing an atomic bomb. They knew they could not keep the knowledge of how to build the bomb a secret forever.ADThanks to the successful secret research efforts of physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer and his team of scientists at the Los Alamos Laboratory in New Mexico, the Army detonated the first atomic bomb, code name Trinity, on July 16, 1945.Just weeks later, the United States dropped atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945 to end World War II in the Pacific. Some cautioned against using the atomic bombs at all during the war, and following the war, these warnings again emerged to shape nuclear policy. In 1946, after studying the effect of the atomic bomb, the U.S. Strategic Bombing survey stated: \u201cAs the developer and exploiter of this ominous weapon, our nation has a responsibility, which no American should shirk, to lead in establishing and implementing the international guarantees and controls which will prevent its future use.\u201dADAnd so, while the United States expanded its nuclear arsenal, it also crafted strategies for controlling and preventing its use. President Dwight Eisenhower made nuclear arms control a priority with his 1953 Atoms for Peace speech, which argued for diverting nuclear power to peaceful purposes. Eisenhower\u2019s Open Skies proposal for mutual aerial inspection and a nuclear test ban treaty started diplomatic outreach with the Soviet Union.ADSignifying its bipartisan nature, President John F. Kennedy picked up Eisenhower\u2019s push for a test ban when he entered office in 1961.The shock of the Cuban missile crisis of 1962, which brought the United States and the U.S.S.R. to the brink of nuclear war, further increased the urgency for diplomacy. A hotline between the United States and the Soviets was set up to improve communications to prevent nuclear war.ADKennedy, one year after the Cuban missile crisis, achieved a Limited Nuclear Test Ban Treaty with the Soviet Union banning nuclear tests in the atmosphere, underwater and space. Underground nuclear tests continued. The landmark treaty was pivotal for reducing tensions and showing it was possible for the Cold War rivals to negotiate successfully. There was the realization that a continuing arms race posed both massive dangers and costs that could not be sustained.ADIn 1968, President Lyndon Johnson achieved the  Non-Proliferation Treaty which committed the United States and other nuclear powers to eventually disarm. While U.S. policy during the 1970s was primarily aimed at nuclear arms limitations and confidence-building measures to reduce the threat, under President Ronald Reagan in the 1980s, negotiators were able to turn toward actual arms reductions.Beginning in 1985, Reagan held summit meetings with his Soviet counterpart, Mikhail Gorbachev, and these led to breakthrough treaties including the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces pact eliminating short- and medium-range nuclear missiles. Reagan\u2019s famous \u201ctrust but verify\u201d line came about as verification was essential to make sure treaty commitments were being honored. Getting the Soviets to agree to inspections of their nuclear facilities was a huge diplomatic achievement.ADWhen George H.W. Bush took office, he carried over Reagan\u2019s momentum and secured the original START Treaty reducing U.S. and Russian strategic nuclear warheads. President Bill Clinton worked toward getting the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty signed. His successor, George W. Bush, achieved a treaty with Russia reducing strategic nuclear warheads.ADPresident Barack Obama, like Reagan, stated his desire for a nuclear weapons-free world and achieved the New START accord with Russia, further reducing both nations\u2019 arsenals. Obama also achieved an agreement with Iran to prevent them from developing a nuclear weapon.But while for over 60 years presidents in both parties worked to reduce nuclear weapons and the likelihood of their use, Trump has begun unraveling these efforts. Trump has withdrawn the United States from arms treaties including the landmark INF agreement and the Iran nuclear deal. Additionally, he has failed to extend the New START accord, which expires early next year.ADIf it expires without renewal or a replacement, then we will have no treaty in place controlling the two largest nuclear arsenals. There will be no trust, no verification. Today, there are about 14,000 nuclear weapons worldwide according the Arms Control Association, most of them held by the United States and Russia. We constantly live with the fear of more nations, perhaps even terrorists, acquiring these weapons of mass destruction.ADYet Trump continues to reject nuclear diplomacy including the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, which bans all nuclear test explosions. Trump has also gone forward with expensive nuke modernization plans that will further drain America\u2019s precious resources, forcing billions of dollars each year to go toward nuclear weapons.All nations share the burden of nukes and every country would benefit from diverting resources from nukes toward feeding the hungry, fighting disease and climate change.ADBut this demands American leadership on the issue. As Eisenhower said about disarmament in 1955, \u201cIt would ease the fears of war in the anxious hearts of people everywhere. It would lighten the burdens upon the backs of the people. It would make it possible for every nation, great and small, developed and less developed, to advance the standards of living of its people, to attain better food, and clothing, and shelter, more of education and larger enjoyment of life.\u201dADThe first atomic bomb changed our world in July 1945. It was the ultimate weapon, a product of World War II and a trigger for the Cold War nuclear arms race to follow.But as we remember this moment in history, we cannot lose sight of the dangerous consequences nuclear weapons continue to have on the world today. We must not become complacent about this threat after so many years and just casually accept their existence. Seventy-five years after Trinity, banning nuclear testing and working toward eliminating nukes is the only sensible path forward. Nuclear weapons must become part of our history only, not a threat to our future.", "comment": "3 Comments", "topic": "Made by History"}, {"cover": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/NKVJCRWCZAI6VH65W6WGWBI5ZA.jpghttps://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/NKVJCRWCZAI6VH65W6WGWBI5ZA.jpg", "title": "Failing to renew VOA foreign staffers\u2019 visas would devastate one of its core functions", "date": "Jul 10, 2020", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/global-opinions/failing-to-renew-voa-foreign-staffers-visas-would-devastate-one-of-its-core-functions/2020/07/10/a942400c-c200-11ea-b4f6-cb39cd8940fb_story.html", "keyword": "China and Security", "website": "the Washington Post", "author": "Editorial Board", "content": "MICHAEL PACK, the alt-right filmmaker installed by President Trump to run U.S.\u00a0foreign broadcasting operations, remains on course to dismantle the independent journalism that has been their calling card.

And, more important, what about the Trump of a potential second term in the White House?On June 1, as demonstrators gathered and marched in Washington and around the country to protest the killing of George Floyd by the Minneapolis police, President Trump, in a brief speech in the White House Rose Garden, called for states to use the National Guard to \u201cdominate the streets\u201d and promised that if they didn\u2019t, \u201cI will deploy the United States military and quickly solve the problem for them.\u201d Federal forces then used tear gas and stun grenades on peaceful protesters to clear a path for him to walk from the White House to nearby St. John\u2019s Episcopal Church for a photo op with a Bible as prop.ADAD\u201cThe fascist speech Donald Trump just delivered verged on a declaration of war against American citizens,\u201d Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) tweeted. Rep. Jared Huffman (D-Calif.) \u2014 noting in an opinion column three days later that the president\u2019s \u201cattempt to use chaos to shred democratic safeguards and consolidate authoritarian power is deadly serious\u201d \u2014 put it this way: \u201cThis is our own Reichstag fire and, yes, Trump is playing the role of would-be Fuehrer, proclaiming a \u2018God-given signal\u2019 to seize more power.\u201dI first reported on Trump in 1982, when he conned me into putting him on the Forbes 400 rich list. That Trump was just a younger version of this Trump, and now I worry that what happened in June was a mere prelude; he\u2019s certainly capable of a far worse Reichstag-fire-like event that would allow him to steal the 2020 election. And if he does win a second term, legitimately or not, his words and actions of the past four years provide 12 indicators that he would seek to replace our democracy with a fascist dictatorship.1. Trump uses military power and federal law enforcement to suppress peaceful political protest. In June, he deployed the National Guard and federal  officers to violently evict protesters in Washington,  terrorizing them with two military helicopters flying low near the crowd. Trump also had 1,600 members of the 82nd Airborne on standby outside the capital and readied tens of thousands of rounds of ammunition. It\u2019s reported that he wanted to deploy 10,000 troops to Washington alone. Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, took this so seriously that he got into a shouting match with the president over the prospect of deploying active-duty troops on U.S. soil.ADAD2. Trump persistently lies about voter fraud, setting the stage for him to use emergency powers to seize control of the election or challenge the results if he loses. During a recent special election in California, for example, after a Republican mayor requested the opening of an additional polling station, Trump tweeted falsely that the Democrats \u201chave just opened a voting booth in the most Democrat area in the State. They are trying to steal another election. It\u2019s all rigged out there. These votes must not count. SCAM!\u201d Trump has repeatedly tweeted that mail-in voting will lead to fraudulent and rigged elections. After winning the 2016 presidential election while losing the popular vote, he claimed a landslide victory and said that Hillary Clinton\u2019s lead in the popular vote was due to \u201cmillions of people who voted illegally.\u201d3. Trump has repeatedly suggested that he might remain in office after a second term and has offered reason to doubt he\u2019d leave peacefully after this first term. \u201cUnder the normal rules, I\u2019ll be out in 2024, so we may have to go for an extra term,\u201d he said at a rally last September. A year earlier, he remarked, \u201cPresident for life .\u2009.\u2009. maybe we\u2019ll have to give that a shot someday.\u201d It\u2019s a joke he\u2019s tossed off on several occasions, and the power of suggestion is so strong in Trump and his followers that Joe Biden, Nancy Pelosi and former Trump attorney Michael Cohen have all expressed serious concern that Trump may try to steal the election or contest the results, and not leave the White House if he loses.4. Trump appears to believe he has the power to outlaw speech critical of him, and he calls the free press \u201cthe enemy of the people.\u201d He tweeted of the New York Times and The Washington Post: \u201cThey are both a disgrace to our Country, the Enemy of the People.\u201d Former national security adviser John Bolton, in his new book, claims that Trump said of journalists: \u201cThese people should be executed. They are scumbags.\u201dADAD5. With Fox News promoting Trump\u2019s lies as truth, the president controls one of the most powerful propaganda machines ever created. During the impeachment trial, for example, Fox hosts repeatedly attacked the character and mental faculties of Democratic representatives and sworn witnesses, while focusing almost exclusively on the testimony of pro-Trump Republicans. When it did show footage of Democrats and witnesses, the network frequently used voice-overs to explain or interpret what was being said, rather than broadcasting what was actually being said.6. Trump believes that he has the power to do what he wants, regardless of Congress or the courts. \u201cI have an Article II, where I have the right to do whatever I want as president,\u201d he has said. He has also claimed to have the \u201cabsolute right to do what I want to do with the Justice Department\u201d and, in the event the judiciary branch disagreed, \u201cthe absolute right to PARDON myself.\u201d His attorney general, William Barr, and his own lawyers have made clear that this is the administration\u2019s position as they have rejected both congressional and criminal subpoenas for information during the past few years. Their arguments \u2014 including an assertion to a federal appellate court last October that the president could shoot someone in the middle of New York\u2019s Fifth Avenue and still be immune from prosecution until he left office \u2014 came crashing down with a Supreme Court decision Thursday. \u201cWe cannot conclude that absolute immunity is necessary or appropriate under Article II or the Supremacy Clause,\u201d Chief Justice John Roberts wrote.7. Trump acts as if he owns our government and can fire any official who defends the law. He has dismissed an FBI director and a deputy FBI director, as well as five inspectors general and U.S. attorneys, all of whom were investigating or considering either his abuse of power or the alleged crimes of his cronies. This past week, Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, who served as a national security aide at the White House until earlier this year and was up for a promotion, resigned from the military, citing \u201cbullying, intimidation, and retaliation\u201d after he testified under oath to Congress counter to Trump\u2019s interests.ADAD8. Trump uses federal prosecutorial powers to investigate his opponents and anyone who dares scrutinize him or his allies for the many crimes they may have committed. After the Mueller investigation of Russia\u2019s role in the 2016 election, Trump\u2019s Justice Department began a criminal probe into the origins of the inquiry \u2014 to, in Trump\u2019s words, \u201cinvestigate the investigators.\u201d He tried to get the Justice Department to prosecute former FBI director James Comey and Hillary Clinton.9. Trump viciously attacks his critics and has publicly implied that the Ukraine whistleblower should be hanged for treason. During a speech to diplomatic staffers in New York last September, Trump said: \u201cI want to know who\u2019s the person who gave the whistleblower the information? Because that\u2019s close to a spy. You know what we used to do in the old days when we were smart? Right? The spies and treason, we used to handle it a little differently than we do now.\u201d10. Trump has messianic delusions that are supported with religious fervor by millions of his supporters. He has \u201cjokingly\u201d looked up to the sky and said, \u201cI am the chosen one\u201d in relation to negotiations with China. Then-Energy Secretary Rick Perry echoed other evangelicals who\u2019ve said that Trump was sent by God to do great things when he seriously proclaimed that Trump is the \u201cchosen one.\u201d  A Guardian report described the evangelical response to Trump\u2019s photo op in front of Lafayette Square\u2019s St. John\u2019s Episcopal Church, which many viewed positively: One evangelical supporter was so moved that she began speaking in tongues when she saw the footage, according to her son.ADAD11. Trump subscribes to a doctrine of genetic superiority and incites racial hatred to scapegoat immigrants and gain power. He has rallied his base with dog-whistle attacks, calling Mexicans rapists and criminals. When he attacked a group of progressive members of Congress from diverse backgrounds, he stated that they should go back to the places they came from. Over the years Trump has frequently praised his \u201cwinning\u201d genes, at one point telling an interviewer, \u201cI\u2019m proud to have that German blood \u2014 there\u2019s no question about it.\u201d12. Trump finds common ground with the world\u2019s most ruthless dictators while denigrating America\u2019s democratic allies. The oppressive leaders he has praised  include North Korea\u2019s Kim Jong Un (\u201cHe gets it. He totally gets it\u201d); the Philippines\u2019s Rodrigo Duterte (\u201cWhat a great job you are doing\u201d); Saudi Arabia\u2019s Mohammed bin Salman (\u201cYou have done a spectacular job\u201d); and, of course, Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin (\u201cYou know what? Putin\u2019s fine. He\u2019s fine\u201d). Meanwhile, he has attacked traditional U.S. alliances and allies, like NATO and Germany\u2019s Angela Merkel (\u201cStupid\u201d).Twitter: @JournalistJGRead more from Outlook:The 6 essential cons that define Trump\u2019s successFollow our updates on Facebook and ", "comment": "2k Comments", "topic": "Outlook"}, {"cover": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/OI7LHIWGTMI6VMBX7FYR7CPOIY.jpghttps://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/OI7LHIWGTMI6VMBX7FYR7CPOIY.jpg", "title": "White House backs away from Fauci attacks days after promoting them", "date": "Jul 15, 2020", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/white-house-distances-itself-from-extraordinary-navarro-op-ed-criticizing-fauci/2020/07/15/05121c6e-c697-11ea-b037-f9711f89ee46_story.html", "keyword": "China and Security", "website": "the Washington Post", "author": "John WagnerMeryl KornfieldToluse Olorunnipa", "content": "The chaos surrounding the federal response to the coronavirus crisis escalated Wednesday as infighting between a top trade adviser to President Trump and other senior administration officials burst into public view, exposing the White House\u2019s lack of message discipline and focus amid a surging pandemic.Support our journalism.

Fauci, the nation\u2019s top infectious-disease expert, the White House sought to distance itself from the anti-Fauci effort Wednesday by publicly chastising trade adviser Peter Navarro for writing a USA Today op-ed blasting the popular public health official.Trump chided Navarro on Wednesday for the opinion piece, which ran under the headline \u201cAnthony Fauci has been wrong about everything I have interacted with him on,\u201d and the White House released a statement saying the article was unauthorized. Fauci told the Atlantic that \u201cI can\u2019t explain Peter Navarro\u201d and that \u201che\u2019s in a world by himself.\u201d White House officials anonymously told reporters that chief of staff Mark Meadows was \u201cfully engaged\u201d and found Navarro\u2019s behavior \u201cunacceptable.\u201dThe latest on the pandemic and the Trump administration\u2019s responseThe extraordinary moves illustrated how a White House known for dysfunction and internal drama has come to realize that there is little appetite among the public for such qualities in the middle of a health crisis that has decimated the economy. Even Trump, who has long courted controversy and intrigue, publicly complained about the lack of discipline among his aides.ADAD\u201cHe made a statement representing himself. He shouldn\u2019t be doing that,\u201d Trump said of Navarro as he spoke with reporters before departing the White House for an event in Georgia.The White House effort to disavow Navarro\u2019s op-ed came despite moves in recent days by Trump and senior administration officials to raise questions about Fauci\u2019s credibility, including by giving reporters a list of instances in which they alleged Fauci had been incorrect about aspects of the pandemic.Fauci, in an interview with the Atlantic published Wednesday, called the attempts to discredit him \u201cbizarre\u201d and counterproductive.\u201cI cannot figure out in my wildest dreams why they would want to do that,\u201d Fauci said. \u201cI think they realize now that that was not a prudent thing to do, because it\u2019s only reflecting negatively on them.\u201dWhite House effort to undermine Fauci is criticized by public health experts, scientists and DemocratsTrump sought to minimize the discord among his advisers.ADAD\u201cWe\u2019re all on the same team, including Dr. Fauci,\u201d the president told reporters.At an earlier White House event, Trump said twice, when asked about the Navarro op-ed, that he gets along very well with Fauci. Navarro has played a role in the coronavirus response, particularly on supply chain issues.Earlier Wednesday, the White House sought to make clear it had not blessed Navarro\u2019s USA Today piece.\u201cThe Peter Navarro op-ed didn\u2019t go through normal White House clearance processes and is the opinion of Peter alone,\u201d White House spokeswoman Alyssa Farah said in a tweet, adding: \u201c@realDonaldTrump values the expertise of the medical professionals advising his Administration.\u201dADMeadows was not happy with Navarro\u2019s decision to write the op-ed, which came after the trade adviser had been told to de-escalate the rift with Fauci, according to a White House official, who like others spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations.ADNavarro apologized to Meadows on Wednesday morning, according to a senior administration official. Navarro had asked for permission to write the op-ed, and wrote it anyway after being been turned down, according to two officials.\u201cPeter Navarro\u2019s statement or op-ed or whatever you want to classify it as was an independent action that was a violation of well-established protocols that was not supported overtly or covertly by anybody in the West Wing,\u201d Meadows told reporters traveling with the president to Georgia.ADHe declined to say whether it was a fireable offense.\u201cI don\u2019t talk about personnel matters,\u201d Meadows said.The White House declined to say Wednesday if Navarro would be punished in any way.Despite the White House\u2019s posture, Navarro\u2019s op-ed in some way echoed Trump\u2019s comments during a Fox News interview last week with Sean Hannity, when he said Fauci \u201cis a nice man, but he\u2019s made a lot of mistakes.\u201dADFauci hasn\u2019t spoken with Trump since June, The Washington Post has reported.Among the criticisms circulated by White House officials and Navarro is that Fauci didn\u2019t urge caution when the cases were first reported in China in January, that he gave varied advice on masks and that he has said that he didn\u2019t believe there was concrete scientific evidence to support that hydroxychloroquine is an effective treatment against the coronavirus. Navarro has been a vocal advocate of the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine, an anti-malarial drug, despite the Food and Drug Administration revoking its emergency authorization for the medication after major studies found it wasn\u2019t effective for covid-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus.Touting criticized study, White House presses FDA to authorize hydroxychloroquine \u2014 againDan Scavino, the White House social media director and deputy chief of staff for communications, late Sunday shared a cartoon on his Facebook page mocking Fauci. It depicted the scientist as a faucet spewing cold water on the economy, with phrases written alongside including \u201cSchools stay closed this fall,\u201d \u201cIndefinite lockdown\u201d and \u201cNo NFL season.\u201d Scavino, who is one of Trump\u2019s longest-serving and most trusted aides, did not face any public reprimand from the White House for the post.ADADWhile Trump has personally soured on Fauci, he has decided that a public feud is not in his best interest, given that Fauci has a higher approval rating than he does, according to an official who spoke to the president. Fauci told the Atlantic that the White House attacks against him had wound up hurting Trump.A string of polls show Trump with a slumping approval rating for handling the pandemic, which has infected more than 3.3\u2009million Americans and killed at least 134,000. A Quinnipiac University poll released Wednesday showed Biden leading Trump by 15 percentage points, a 52-37 margin that marks the widest gap yet between the two men.Trump\u2019s political opponents have seized on the public rift between the White House and Fauci. A recent New York Times/Siena College poll showed that 67\u2009percent of voters trusted Fauci for information on the coronavirus, compared with 26\u2009percent who trusted Trump.ADADThe Lincoln Project, a super PAC launched by veteran Republican operatives seeking to oust Trump from office, put out a video ad Wednesday praising Fauci and slamming his critics.\u201cNow Donald Trump is attacking Dr. Fauci. Why? Because Trump failed America,\u201d the ad\u2019s narrator said. \u201cSo he does what he always does \u2014 attack and blame.\u201dThe ad featured archival footage of former Republican presidents, including George H.W. Bush, praising Fauci.Republican lawmakers have been hesitant to follow Trump\u2019s lead in criticizing Fauci, who has served under six presidents during a decades-long career in Washington and received the Presidential Medal of Freedom.ADSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), praised Fauci on Wednesday, telling reporters in his home state that he continued to have \u201ctotal\u201d confidence in him.ADSpeaking to ABC News\u2019s \u201cPowerhouse Politics\u201d podcast Wednesday, Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan (R) sharply criticized the White House for targeting Fauci, calling the effort \u201cabsolutely outrageous\u201d and \u201cone of the biggest mistakes.\u201dVice President Pence tweeted out a picture of his coronavirus task force meeting Wednesday afternoon in which Fauci was prominently featured.\u201cProductive meeting of the @WhiteHouse Coronavirus Task Force today,\u201d he wrote.As the coronavirus crisis spins out of control, Trump issues directives \u2014 but still no clear planOne White House official said the administration was attempting to de-escalate the situation with Fauci in the days ahead, a tacit admission that efforts to tarnish his credibility had backfired.ADBut both allies and critics of the Trump administration fear the White House\u2019s attempts to move on from ill-advised attacks against an epidemiologist during a pandemic could be upended with a presidential tweet.ADNavarro, one of the few remaining White House officials who started back in 2017, has claimed to be a true representative of the Trump agenda. He has outlasted many of his rivals and survived previous controversies.In 2018, Navarro apologized after saying on Fox News that there was a \u201cspecial place in hell\u201d for Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who had clashed with the president on trade. But Trump, who was incensed at Trudeau over a news conference he gave, had actually called for White House officials to publicly attack the Canadian leader on television, former national security adviser John Bolton wrote in his recent memoir, \u201cThe Room Where It Happened.\u201dTrump has often supported Navarro\u2019s pugilistic style and pined for more people to defend him aggressively.Navarro\u2019s op-ed was a clear example of the kind of forceful, no-holds-barred media engagement Trump has supported during his time in office. Trump has felt under siege in recent weeks, complaining about media coverage and lamenting to friends about the pandemic and social unrest unfolding under his watch.In the USA Today piece, Navarro praised Trump and criticized Fauci for \u201ctelling the news media not to worry\u201d about the coronavirus in late JanuaryHe did not mention that Trump also was telling Americans not to worry in late January and for several weeks after, predicting that the virus would \u201cdisappear\u201d on its own.\n\n\n\nJosh Dawsey contributed to this report.", "comment": "5.9k Comments", "topic": "Politics"}, {"cover": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/4B2HD5WAKQI6VN62LAB3FFHENU.jpghttps://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/4B2HD5WAKQI6VN62LAB3FFHENU.jpg", "title": "The Technology 202: Many tech companies received large coronavirus relief loans", "date": "Jul 7, 2020", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/the-technology-202-many-tech-companies-received-large-coronavirus-relief-loans/2020/07/07/a8c79d12-b84f-4e1b-893c-09fabc6d086c_story.html", "keyword": "China and Security", "website": "the Washington Post", "author": "Cat Zakrzewski", "content": "Prominent tech companies that have raised millions in venture capital funding were among the recipients of some of the largest loans distributed by the federal government to small businesses during the coronavirus pandemic.\u00a0Support our journalism.

Some critics have previously said these businesses should have taken priority over tech companies that have existing investors with deep reserves of funding on hand.\u00a0ADADAs my colleagues wrote yesterday, the new data \u201cpaints a picture of a haphazard first-come, first-served program that was not designed to evaluate the relative need of the recipients.\u201dThere was also widespread confusion when the program launched over whether start-ups that raised venture funding were even eligible for the government-backed loans. That sparked an intense industry lobbying effort to force the government to clarify the rules, a move backed by several prominent congressional Democrats. Venture capitalists argued the industry needed the loans to help build technologies that could aid with pandemic response.

These companies all received loans between $5 million and $10 million, according to data released yesterday by the Small Business Administration about the $660 billion relief program.\u00a0The recruiting start-up Hired and supply chain payments company TradeShift also took loans between $5 million and $10 million, according to SBA records. These companies declined to comment.\u00a0Several companies defended taking PPP loans as a necessary lifeline as the pandemic dramatically disrupted their businesses.\u00a0ADAD\u201cOn a global basis, our business was drastically impacted by the lockdowns and restrictions stemming from the coronavirus pandemic,\u201d Getaround spokeswoman Courtney Richard said in a statement. \u201cThe PPP program helped reduce the otherwise severe impact on the health of our organization. In turn, this enabled us to continue providing an essential service to the communities we serve.\u201dHowever there were signs some of these companies were struggling prior to the pandemic. Getaround for instance announced significant layoffs in early January, as the company sought to cut costs.\u00a0The new records have reignited a debate in Silicon Valley about whether venture-backed companies should have applied for the relief.\u00a0The tech sector has not been as dramatically impacted by the pandemic as some other small businesses seeking the loans, including restaurants, hair and nail salons and small retailers. Some critics have previously said these businesses should have taken priority over tech companies that have existing investors with deep reserves of funding on hand.\u00a0ADADAs my colleagues wrote yesterday, the new data \u201cpaints a picture of a haphazard first-come, first-served program that was not designed to evaluate the relative need of the recipients.\u201dThere was also widespread confusion when the program launched over whether start-ups that raised venture funding were even eligible for the government-backed loans. That sparked an intense industry lobbying effort to force the government to clarify the rules, a move backed by several prominent congressional Democrats. Venture capitalists argued the industry needed the loans to help build technologies that could aid with pandemic response. The new filings show many tech companies ultimately moved forward with applying for the program.\u00a0Now, the companies that took these loans say it helped them avoid layoffs, at least until the end of the year.\u00a0ADAD\u201cThe funding offered through the Program played a significant role in helping us avoid headcount reductions and positioned us to maintain our full staffing levels for the rest of 2020,\u201d said BarkBox chief of staff Christina Donnelly in a statement.\u00a0Other major tech players, however, disputed the SBA records.\u00a0The list included several major venture capital firms, including Foundation Capital and Index Ventures. But both firms told The Technology 202 that they had never applied for such a loan, and the addresses included in the SBA's filings were inaccurate. They said they were working with the agency to correct the record.\u00a0\u201cThe entry listed is in error, as although it lists us as a business name, it is not our address or correct information about our fund,\u201d Index spokeswoman Ana Andreescu said in an email. \u201cOur legal team is looking into why our name is listed and look to correct it ASAP.\u201dADADBird, a purveyor of on-demand scooters, was also listed as a loan recipient. But the company says it never formally applied for such a loan, even though it did at one point discuss the possibility of taking one with its banker Citi, Bird chief executive Travis VanderZanden said on Twitter:\u00a0Citi also disputed the records. \u201c\u201cCiti has not funded a PPP loan for Bird,\u201d spokeswoman Danielle Romero-Apsilos said in a statement. \"Citi will seek the assistance of the SBA to ensure that the agency\u2019s data accurately reflects actual PPP lending.\u201dThe SBA did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the venture firms' denial they should be included in the records. \u00a0A senior administration official did say some firms might mistakenly appear in its database if the loans were later returned.Other companies that appeared on the list said they already returned the money.\u00a0ZocDoc, an online medical appointment booking service, said it paid it back more than a month ago.\u00a0ADAD\u201cAs a business that saw our revenue based on in-person doctor appointment bookings dramatically decline at the onset of COVID-19, we met the criteria and applied for the SBA loan,\u201d ZocDoc spokeswoman Jessica Aptman said in a statement. \u201cSubsequently, as our business began to recover \u2014 due to our quick expansion into telehealth and the return of in-person bookings \u2014 we were able to obtain additional capital. As a result, we fully returned all PPP funds over a month ago so they could be redistributed to other small businesses in need.\u201dOur top tabsSecretary of State Mike Pompeo says the United States is \u201clooking at\u201d banning TikTok and other Chinese social apps.\u00a0His remarks on Fox News follow mounting tensions between the U.S. government and China, where TikTok's parent company ByteDance is based.

But the durability of this much-needed recovery \u2014 and, with that, the sustainable recovery of the global economy \u2014\u00a0is unlikely to be firmly established without a few more iterations\u00a0in the historically tricky process of learning how best to live with Covid-19.Support our journalism. Subscribe today.arrow-rightThe surprisingly strong jobs report for June followed what many others and I felt had been the biggest data surprise ever witnessed by economists and Wall Street analysts \u2014 the previous month\u2019s report.The 4.8 million net new jobs in June were almost twice the 2.5 million in May. It\u2019s a record-setting outcome that came well ahead of the median consensus estimate of 3.1 million, itself subject to a wide variation of individual forecasts, falling essentially in a range of 900,000 to 5 million.ADADThe nearly 2 percentage point drop in the unemployment rate to 11.1 percent was noticeably better than the expected 12.5 percent. And with the Bureau of Labor Statistics indicating that the possible extent of misclassifications had been reduced to 1 percentage point, it pointed to an impressive 7 percentage point drop from the implied April high of some 10 percent.Signs of a strong labor market recovery went well beyond these widely cited headline numbers. Both labor force participation and the employment-to-population rates showed healthy increases, rising to 61.5% and 54.6% respectively. Moreover, every segment of the population experienced a decline in unemployment, including the one that missed out May\u2019s improvement, Black workers.Two other important data releases last week also pointed to a strong bounce in economic activity.ADADThe ISM index of factory activity for June rose by a stunning 9 percentage points to 52.6, beating the consensus estimate of 49.8, powered in part by the critical orders component. This jump in a widely followed supply-side indicator was accompanied by an equally notably rise in an important demand-side indicator: the surge to 98.1 in the consumer confidence index, up from last month\u2019s revised 85.9 and beating an expected 91.5.Such data warrant optimism about the resilience and agility of the U.S. economy in the face of the economic devastation wrought by the Covid-19 shock, let alone the pain and suffering associated with its debilitating and often-too-deadly health effects. They also come as a relief to more open economies around the world, including China and Europe, whose own data pointed to domestic economic improvement.But extrapolating all this good news forward is subject to five sobering qualifications.ADADFirst, the economy is still early in recovering back to pre-Covid-19\u00a0conditions. As impressive as the record two-month tally of more than 7 million new jobs is, it constitutes only a third of what is needed to fully reverse the March-April carnage in employment. The employment-population ratio remains well below its February level.Second, some other data flashed more yellow than green signals last week. This included continuing jobless claims, which rose to 19.3 million, above the expected\u00a019 million, as new claims amounted to a still worrisome 1.43 million. Other high-frequency indicators of economic activity also painted a concerning picture, include the national decline in retail traffic and the increasing number of states experiencing lower mobility.Third, indications are surfacing daily that layoffs are migrating up from small- and medium-sized firms to larger ones as a growing number of these companies talk about \u201cright sizing\u201d for the economy ahead. Airlines led the way last week, with announcements of additional layoffs by American and Air France-KLM, along with new bankruptcies for some Latin American carriers, but this sector is not an exception but rather a leading indicator.ADADFourth, the scale and scope of corporate bankruptcies are expanding beyond the list of usual suspects \u2014 companies that entered the Covid-19 shock with vulnerable balance sheets or whose business evaporated for a long time or both.\u00a0Finally, over the weekend a number of states, including some of the country\u2019s largest such as California and Texas, either halted or reversed more reopenings in response to record new Covid-19 infections and concerns about declining hospitalization capacity. But it was far from a generalized process with a particularly notable exception: Florida\u2019s state authorities resisted the re-closing process despite daily infections topping 11,000, beating the daily record of just more than 10,000 from the previous Tuesday.Together, this supports the view that, rather than constitute a smooth linear process, economic recovery is likely to be bumpy as companies, households and governments look to strike what is an inevitably uncertain and fluid balance between economic activity and public health.ADADOver the next three months or so, the U.S. economy is unfortunately likely to experience a notable moderation in what has been an impressive rebound before once again being in a position to pick up significant steam overall. And this may not be the end of this stop-go-slow-go cycle. But assuming Congress acts to maintain relief measures in a more-targeted and pro-work fashion, as well as initiate work on longer-term policies to bolster productivity and household economic security, these fluctuations should occur in a narrowing band as health and economic experts work\u00a0in concert to strike a sequentially improving balance overall.\u00a0This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Mohamed A.

Subscribe today.arrow-rightIt's true that even as cases spike in western and southern states, deaths haven\u2019t followed the same steep, upward curve \u2014 at least so far. Deaths are still on a downward trajectory; while as many as 3,000 people died daily from the illness in April, that figure has fallen to around 550 deaths per day.\u201cDeaths and the all important Mortality Rate goes down,\u201d he pronounced in a pair of otherwise misleading tweets over the weekend:But coronavirus deaths are almost certain to rise. The key question is how quickly.\u00a0\u201cI do expect to see an increase in deaths in the coming weeks,\u201d Lauren Ancel Meyers, a professor of biology at the University of Texas, told me. \u201cExactly how many more is uncertain, but unfortunately that is what we expect at this point.\u201d\u00a0ADADPresident Trump's former Food and Drug Administration chief Scott Gottlieb said on CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation\u201d that \u201cthe total number of deaths is going to start going up again as the number of hospitalizations starts to spike again.\u201d\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re going to have more deaths, tragically,\" he said.Epidemiologists say there are several potential reasons for why the death rate is trailing infections.\u00a0Infections appear to be spreading fastest among younger people as they start mingling more.Younger Americans are far less prone to serious illness or death than elderly Americans, so it\u2019s feasible that as the virus burns through this population, it may cause proportionally fewer hospitalizations and fatalities.ADIn Arizona, around 40 percent of known cases were among people younger than 44 at the beginning of May but that\u2019s now up to 60 percent of all cases. Florida officials have said people ages 18 to 44 are primarily responsible for the state\u2019s recent spike in cases. And in Texas, more than half of new cases in the counties that encompass Austin, Dallas, Houston and San Antonio are among the young.\u00a0And as testing becomes even more widespread \u2014 between 600,000 and 700,000 tests are now being conducted in the United States every day \u2014 more people with only mild cases of covid-19 or no symptoms at all are being included in the testing tallies.Deaths also lag behind infections by three or four weeks.Patients seriously ill with covid-19 generally don\u2019t die until weeks into their illness. So, as infections and hospitalizations surge in states including Arizona, California, Texas and Florida, deaths will follow.ADAD\u201cWe know death is a lagging indicator,\u201d said Abraar Karan, a physician at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital. \u201cYou have cases show up first, hospitalizations next and deaths show up after that.\u201d\u00a0It\u2019s been clear for more than a month that infections are rising rapidly. Hospitalizations in most of these states are also climbing; over the weekend, coronavirus-related hospitalizations rose to their highest levels to date in Arizona and Nevada.There are emerging signs that deaths are already trending upward in some states.Compared to two weeks ago, the seven-day average of daily deaths is up nearly 50 percent in Florida and 54 percent in Arizona, according to the tracking website 91-DIVOC, which pulls data from Johns Hopkins University. The statewide death rate in both California and Texas is still holding steady, but some hospitals in both states have reported they\u2019re nearing capacity in intensive care units.ADAD\u201cAfter Texas reported another single-day record for new coronavirus cases over the weekend, Austin Mayor Steve Adler (D) told CNN\u2019s \u2018State of the Union\u2019 that there won\u2019t be enough medical personnel to keep up with the spike in cases if the rate of increase continues unabated in his city,\u201d Robert Barnes and Derek Hawkins report.\u201cIf we don\u2019t change this trajectory, then I am within two weeks of having our hospitals overrun,\u201d Adler said, noting that the city's intensive care units could be overflowing within 10 days.There's some good news: Doctors have figured out better ways of treating covid-19 patients.Experts say this could be a small factor in lower death rates.ADPhysicians have come a long way in developing a standardized way of caring for covid-19 patients, compared to the pandemic\u2019s outset. They\u2019ve learned \u2014 and research has confirmed \u2014 that dexamethasone cuts the risk of death for patients on a ventilator by a third and reduces the risk of death for patients on oxygen by a fifth.ADAnother drug, remdesivir, has been shown to speed up hospital recoveries by four days, but didn\u2019t have a statistically significant impact on survival rates. Doctors have also discovered that putting severely ill patients in a prone position improves the flow of oxygen to their lungs.\u00a0And then there\u2019s plasma transfusion, where patients are given blood plasma from people who recovered. Those who have recovered from an infection have virus-fighting antibodies floating in their blood that can help the immune systems of recipients fight off an infection.Former and current government officials issued dire warnings yesterday.Gottlieb also had this dire prediction about the country's political leadership, per a \u201cFace the Nation\u201d producer:Tom Bossert, former homeland security advisor to Trump, had this to say:By the time deaths go up again, it could be too late to turn the trend around with more drastic restrictions.\u00a0New coronavirus infections in Florida, for instance, exceeded 10,000 in a day for the third time in the past week, after the state posted a record of 11,458 the previous day. \u201cThe new infections pushed the state\u2019s total caseload past 200,000, a mark passed by just two other states, New York and California,\u201d Robert and Derek write.ADAD\u201cFrustration about the pandemic response has mounted among local leaders, who say they have had to grapple with conflicting orders and frequently changing guidelines from governors and the White House as they try to curb sharply rising infections,\u201d Derek and Marisa Iati report.\u201cWe don\u2019t have room to experiment; we don\u2019t have room for incrementalism when we\u2019re seeing these kinds of numbers,\u201d said Judge Lina Hidalgo (D), the top elected official in Harris County, Tex., which encompasses the sprawling Houston metro area. \u201cNor should we wait for all the hospital beds to fill and all these people to die before we take drastic action.\u201dAhh, oof and ouchAHH: Scientists are using a new method of vaccine development based on deploying RNA to trigger the immune system.\u00a0This cutting-edge approach, not previously used in vaccine development, is showing promise. Developers in Britain, Germany, China and the United States plan to have tens of millions of doses ready by the end of the year,\u201d William Booth and Carolyn Y. Johnson report.\u00a0\u201cElegant in theory, efficacious in the laboratory but untested in the real world, the possible RNA vaccines are especially attractive because they might be cheaper, easier and faster to manufacture on a massive scale \u2014 at least one team boasts it could partner with producers in developing countries to provide millions of vials for as little as $5 a pop.\u201d\u00a0RNA vaccines could mean smaller, more potent doses. But questions do remain about the safety and long-term efficacy of RNA technology.ADADDrugmakers, academic groups and government labs are working on more than 150 vaccine candidates, most using traditional vaccine approaches. But out of 17 teams that have moved into the human testing phase of their potential vaccines, at least five are working toward RNA vaccines.\u00a0\u201cThe RNA vaccines under study come from a small laboratory at Imperial College London, from the People\u2019s Liberation Army Academy of Military Sciences in China, from three large pharmaceutical companies \u2014 Pfizer, Moderna and CureVac \u2014 and their partners,\u201d Will and Carolyn write.\u00a0\u201cThough never deployed in humans outside of clinical trials, the RNA research is being backed by hundreds of millions of dollars in investment, fueled by the urgency to crack the covid code,\u201d they add. \"Each team is seeking the prize of being first to a vaccine, while guaranteeing their own populations will get early access.\u201d\u00a0OOF: Officials and public health experts disputed Trump's assertion that 99 percent of coronavirus cases are \u201ctotally harmless.\u201d\u00a0\u201cNow we have tested almost 40 million people \u2026 by so doing, we show cases 99 percent of which are totally harmless,\u201d Trump said during his Saturday remarks at the White House.\u00a0ADADAsked during an interview on CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation\u201d about the president\u2019s remarks, Gottlieb said he wasn\u2019t \u201creally sure what he\u2019s referring to,\u201d and suggested Trump could be referring to the number of infected people who need to be hospitalized.\u201cBut certainly more than 1 percent of people get serious illness from this,\u201d Gottlieb said. \u201cAbout 60 percent of people who get infected become symptomatic, about 10 to 15 percent of them will develop some form of covid pneumonia and somewhere around 2 to 5 percent of them will become hospitalized, depending on what the age mix is of the people who are getting infected. So this is still a pretty bad virus.\u201d\u00a0On numerous shows, FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn dodged questions about the president\u2019s comments. \u201cWell, let\u2019s talk about where we are right now. We\u2019re seeing cases around the Sun Belt,\u201d Hahn said when asked about the accuracy of the president\u2019s remarks on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201d \"We are certainly concerned, at the White House corona task force, about this \u2026 We\u2019ve sent teams into those states to actually help with taking care of the patients who are now with Covid-19.\u201dADAsked again, he said: \u201cYou know, any case, we don\u2019t want to have in this country. This is a very rapidly moving epidemic, rapidly moving pandemic. And any death, any case is tragic.\u201d\u00a0Asked on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d about Trump\u2019s remarks, Hahn said: \u201cI\u2019m not going to get into who is right and who is wrong\u2026 We have seen the surge in cases. We must do something to stem the tide.\u201dOUCH: There is growing evidence the virus can spread through the air.More than 200 scientists from more than 30\u00a0countries will publish a paper outlining growing evidence of the potential that the coronavirus can spread via airborne transmission. The Post's James McAuley and Emily Rauhala report. The signatories want the World Health Organization to take the possibility seriously,\u00a0\u201cUntil recently, most public health guidelines have focused on social distancing measures, regular hand-washing and precautions to avoid droplets. But the signatories to the paper say the potential of the virus to spread via airborne transmission has not been fully appreciated even by public health institutions such as the WHO,\u201d they write. \u201cThe fact that scientists resorted to a paper to pressure the WHO is unusual, analysts said, and is likely to renew questions about the WHO\u2019s messaging.\u201d\u201cThe paper, which was shared with The Washington Post ahead of publication this week in the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases, comes as the WHO faces criticism over its coronavirus response, calls for reform and a U.S. threat to cut funding and withdraw completely,\u201d they add.In the statesMost U.S. states haven\u2019t publicized details of whether their contact tracing efforts are working.Contact tracing, the process of contacting individuals who have potentially been exposed to the coronavirus and persuading them to quarantine, has been touted by experts as a key to controlling the pandemic.\u00a0\u201cBut most places across the United States aren\u2019t making public how fast or well they\u2019re running it, leaving Americans in the dark about how their governments are mitigating the risk,\u201d Steve Thompson reports.\u00a0D.C. has published contact tracing efforts on an online dashboard. The city built up a staff of several hundred contact tracers and officials say they are seeking to contact those who test positive within 24 hours of a positive test in about 98 percent of cases. Oregon also posts regular data about contact tracing, and New York officials say they plan to do the same soon.\u00a0The District\u2019s dashboard also indicates it will soon publish metrics on the percentage of new cases that are people who tracers have already contacted and who have quarantined because they were in contact with an infected person. That would be a sign of success for a contact-tracing program.As states see a spike in coronavirus cases, the surges will hinder contact tracing efforts. That will be true in places including Texas, Arizona, Nevada, South Carolina, West Virginia, Georgia and California, Steve writes.\u201cBut even states seeing declines are finding it hard to measure their success in contact tracing, in part because the effort is often spearheaded by local and county health departments,\u201d he adds. \u201c\u2026The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention posted guidance in April that included various recommended contact-tracing metrics \u2014 none of which are being publicly reported by most states.\u201d\u00a0The Trump administration's effortsVice President Pence has been zigzagging the country, visiting various hot spots where coronavirus cases are spiking.\u00a0It\u2019s an effort to signal that the administration is taking the resurgences seriously, even as the president appears to play down the ongoing pandemic, the Wall Street Journal\u2019s Andrew Restuccia reports.\u00a0Pence spent three hours in Florida on Thursday where he met the governor and local health experts, following similar visits to Arizona and Texas.\u201cAs cases surge around the country, the Trump administration has also once again put members of the White House\u2019s coronavirus task force in the spotlight after several weeks in which the panel was largely out of public view,\u201d Andrew writes. \"Three members of the task force\u2014White House coronavirus coordinator Dr. Deborah Birx, Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Stephen Hahn and Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar\u2014accompanied Mr. Pence on the trip.\u201d\u00a0Pence wore a mask during most of his visit late last week, a contrast with Trump, who has been reticent to wear one in public. Pence's mask-waring is a \u201cresponse to concerns among some in the administration that the White House was sending mixed messages about the importance of wearing a mask, advisers said,\u201d Andrew adds. Pence has pushed back against calls to mandate masks nationwide.The industry impactLow-skilled but essential health workers have been left out of the spotlight as people applaud doctors and nurses.\u00a0The Brookings Institution points to the millions of essential but undervalued and low-paid workers, such as orderlies, pharmacy aides, nursing assistants, as well as janitors and food preparation and serving workers who work in health-care settings. They often face the same risk as their higher-profile colleagues, \u201cbut sometimes with less access to protective gear, pay that can fall below a living wage and only a modicum of recognition,\u201d Justin Jouvenal reports.\u00a0\u201cWith a median wage of $13.58 an hour, some of the largely female and minority cadre of nearly 7 million across the country worry they are a serious case of covid-19 away from financial ruin,\" he writes.Lisa Brown, executive vice president of SEIU Local 1199 for the District and Maryland, said the union is not always informed when the workers fall ill. Brown said early in the pandemic, many workers who were not nurses or doctors were not a priority to get essential products, such as masks.\u00a0Justin adds: \u201cShe said most receive basic gear now, but there are still problems. At one Washington-area medical facility, she said, workers are sharing smocks from shift to shift. Other workers are forced to buy their own equipment if employers don\u2019t provide it.\u201d\u00a0Coronavirus latestAnd here are a few more stories to catch up on after the weekend:\u00a0The hardest hit:\u00a0The covid-19 death of a black man who was disabled underlines questions surrounding disability and race, and provides a glimpse into the fraught end-of-life decisions many are making during the pandemic, Ariana Eunjung Cha reports.Black and Latino residents across the country have been three times as likely to become infected as white residents, according to new CDC data obtained by the New York Times. Black and Latino people have also been nearly twice as likely to die of covid-19, compared with white people, according to the data.\u00a0More on the administration\u2019s response:\u00a0Two working papers point to ways the pandemic will lead to deep psychological scars long term in the United States, including a distrust of government institutions, Christopher Ingraham reports.More from the states:\u00a0After beginning June with no active coronavirus cases, the city of Joplin, Mo., is at the heart of one of the fastest-growing coronavirus hot spots in the country, Griff Witte reports. \u201cAnd like many places that skipped the springtime surge only to be walloped this summer, it\u2019s fighting back with a much-diminished arsenal,\u201d he adds, noting Missouri\u2019s lifted stay-at-home order is not likely to be restored.Curbing the pandemic:\u00a0Temperature checks are being deployed to identify people who may be infected with the coronavirus. But it\u2019s an imperfect system, since many contagious people have no symptoms. Some experts are suggesting that adding on smell tests could work well to better identify infected people, because the loss of sense of smell has been identified as an earlier symptom of the coronavirus, Stat News\u2019s Sharon Begley reports.Good to know:More covid-19 patients are surviving after being placed on ventilators. After reports early in the pandemic indicated that a majority of patients who required ventilators eventually died, since the pandemic has continued U.S. hospitals are \u201creporting much lower mortality rates, results on par with death rates for patients with similar severe lung problems caused by other diseases,\u201d Lenny Bernstein reports.Sugar rush", "comment": "58 Comments", "topic": "PowerPost"}, {"cover": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/2YRLUGF6HYI6VF6BNTYRN77CNQ.jpghttps://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/2YRLUGF6HYI6VF6BNTYRN77CNQ.jpg", "title": "The Health 202: The coronavirus death rate is likely to rise again as cases spike, experts say", "date": "Jul 6, 2020", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/the-health-202/2020/07/06/the-health-202-the-coronavirus-death-rate-is-likely-to-rise-again-as-cases-spike-experts-say/5f01b89c88e0fa7b44f6de88/", "keyword": "China and Security", "website": "the Washington Post", "author": "Paige Winfield Cunningham", "content": "with Paulina FiroziPresident Trump has seized on a bit of positive news as coronavirus cases surge in new hot spots across the country: The country's deaths are still going down.\u00a0Support our journalism. Subscribe today.arrow-rightIt's true that even as cases spike in western and southern states, deaths haven\u2019t followed the same steep, upward curve \u2014 at least so far. Deaths are still on a downward trajectory; while as many as 3,000 people died daily from the illness in April, that figure has fallen to around 550 deaths per day.\u201cDeaths and the all important Mortality Rate goes down,\u201d he pronounced in a pair of otherwise misleading tweets over the weekend:But coronavirus deaths are almost certain to rise. The key question is how quickly.\u00a0\u201cI do expect to see an increase in deaths in the coming weeks,\u201d Lauren Ancel Meyers, a professor of biology at the University of Texas, told me. \u201cExactly how many more is uncertain, but unfortunately that is what we expect at this point.\u201d\u00a0ADADPresident Trump's former Food and Drug Administration chief Scott Gottlieb said on CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation\u201d that \u201cthe total number of deaths is going to start going up again as the number of hospitalizations starts to spike again.\u201d\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re going to have more deaths, tragically,\" he said.Epidemiologists say there are several potential reasons for why the death rate is trailing infections.\u00a0Infections appear to be spreading fastest among younger people as they start mingling more.Younger Americans are far less prone to serious illness or death than elderly Americans, so it\u2019s feasible that as the virus burns through this population, it may cause proportionally fewer hospitalizations and fatalities.ADIn Arizona, around 40 percent of known cases were among people younger than 44 at the beginning of May but that\u2019s now up to 60 percent of all cases. Florida officials have said people ages 18 to 44 are primarily responsible for the state\u2019s recent spike in cases. And in Texas, more than half of new cases in the counties that encompass Austin, Dallas, Houston and San Antonio are among the young.\u00a0And as testing becomes even more widespread \u2014 between 600,000 and 700,000 tests are now being conducted in the United States every day \u2014 more people with only mild cases of covid-19 or no symptoms at all are being included in the testing tallies.Deaths also lag behind infections by three or four weeks.Patients seriously ill with covid-19 generally don\u2019t die until weeks into their illness. So, as infections and hospitalizations surge in states including Arizona, California, Texas and Florida, deaths will follow.ADAD\u201cWe know death is a lagging indicator,\u201d said Abraar Karan, a physician at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital. \u201cYou have cases show up first, hospitalizations next and deaths show up after that.\u201d\u00a0It\u2019s been clear for more than a month that infections are rising rapidly. Hospitalizations in most of these states are also climbing; over the weekend, coronavirus-related hospitalizations rose to their highest levels to date in Arizona and Nevada.There are emerging signs that deaths are already trending upward in some states.Compared to two weeks ago, the seven-day average of daily deaths is up nearly 50 percent in Florida and 54 percent in Arizona, according to the tracking website 91-DIVOC, which pulls data from Johns Hopkins University. The statewide death rate in both California and Texas is still holding steady, but some hospitals in both states have reported they\u2019re nearing capacity in intensive care units.ADAD\u201cAfter Texas reported another single-day record for new coronavirus cases over the weekend, Austin Mayor Steve Adler (D) told CNN\u2019s \u2018State of the Union\u2019 that there won\u2019t be enough medical personnel to keep up with the spike in cases if the rate of increase continues unabated in his city,\u201d Robert Barnes and Derek Hawkins report.\u201cIf we don\u2019t change this trajectory, then I am within two weeks of having our hospitals overrun,\u201d Adler said, noting that the city's intensive care units could be overflowing within 10 days.There's some good news: Doctors have figured out better ways of treating covid-19 patients.Experts say this could be a small factor in lower death rates.ADPhysicians have come a long way in developing a standardized way of caring for covid-19 patients, compared to the pandemic\u2019s outset. They\u2019ve learned \u2014 and research has confirmed \u2014 that dexamethasone cuts the risk of death for patients on a ventilator by a third and reduces the risk of death for patients on oxygen by a fifth.ADAnother drug, remdesivir, has been shown to speed up hospital recoveries by four days, but didn\u2019t have a statistically significant impact on survival rates. Doctors have also discovered that putting severely ill patients in a prone position improves the flow of oxygen to their lungs.\u00a0And then there\u2019s plasma transfusion, where patients are given blood plasma from people who recovered. Those who have recovered from an infection have virus-fighting antibodies floating in their blood that can help the immune systems of recipients fight off an infection.Former and current government officials issued dire warnings yesterday.Gottlieb also had this dire prediction about the country's political leadership, per a \u201cFace the Nation\u201d producer:Tom Bossert, former homeland security advisor to Trump, had this to say:By the time deaths go up again, it could be too late to turn the trend around with more drastic restrictions.\u00a0New coronavirus infections in Florida, for instance, exceeded 10,000 in a day for the third time in the past week, after the state posted a record of 11,458 the previous day. \u201cThe new infections pushed the state\u2019s total caseload past 200,000, a mark passed by just two other states, New York and California,\u201d Robert and Derek write.ADAD\u201cFrustration about the pandemic response has mounted among local leaders, who say they have had to grapple with conflicting orders and frequently changing guidelines from governors and the White House as they try to curb sharply rising infections,\u201d Derek and Marisa Iati report.\u201cWe don\u2019t have room to experiment; we don\u2019t have room for incrementalism when we\u2019re seeing these kinds of numbers,\u201d said Judge Lina Hidalgo (D), the top elected official in Harris County, Tex., which encompasses the sprawling Houston metro area. \u201cNor should we wait for all the hospital beds to fill and all these people to die before we take drastic action.\u201dAhh, oof and ouchAHH: Scientists are using a new method of vaccine development based on deploying RNA to trigger the immune system.\u00a0This cutting-edge approach, not previously used in vaccine development, is showing promise.

So this is still a pretty bad virus.\u201d\u00a0On numerous shows, FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn dodged questions about the president\u2019s comments. \u201cWell, let\u2019s talk about where we are right now.

Black and Latino people have also been nearly twice as likely to die of covid-19, compared with white people, according to the data.\u00a0More on the administration\u2019s response:\u00a0Two working papers point to ways the pandemic will lead to deep psychological scars long term in the United States, including a distrust of government institutions, Christopher Ingraham reports.More from the states:\u00a0After beginning June with no active coronavirus cases, the city of Joplin, Mo., is at the heart of one of the fastest-growing coronavirus hot spots in the country, Griff Witte reports. \u201cAnd like many places that skipped the springtime surge only to be walloped this summer, it\u2019s fighting back with a much-diminished arsenal,\u201d he adds, noting Missouri\u2019s lifted stay-at-home order is not likely to be restored.Curbing the pandemic:\u00a0Temperature checks are being deployed to identify people who may be infected with the coronavirus. But it\u2019s an imperfect system, since many contagious people have no symptoms. Some experts are suggesting that adding on smell tests could work well to better identify infected people, because the loss of sense of smell has been identified as an earlier symptom of the coronavirus, Stat News\u2019s Sharon Begley reports.Good to know:More covid-19 patients are surviving after being placed on ventilators. After reports early in the pandemic indicated that a majority of patients who required ventilators eventually died, since the pandemic has continued U.S. hospitals are \u201creporting much lower mortality rates, results on par with death rates for patients with similar severe lung problems caused by other diseases,\u201d Lenny Bernstein reports.Sugar rush", "comment": "58 Comments", "topic": "PowerPost"}, {"cover": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/6FBMHTFQUMI6VGFVE6NGI6NB4Q.jpghttps://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/6FBMHTFQUMI6VGFVE6NGI6NB4Q.jpg", "title": "A coronavirus vaccine rooted in a government partnership is fueling financial rewards for company executives", "date": "Jul 2, 2020", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/07/02/coronavirus-vaccine-moderna-rna/", "keyword": "China and Security", "website": "the Washington Post", "author": "Christopher RowlandCarolyn Y.

Subscribe today.arrow-rightJay Clayton, chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, responded that companies should avoid even the appearance of impropriety. \u201cWhy would you want to even raise the question that you were doing something that was inappropriate?\u201d he said.Notwithstanding Clayton\u2019s statement, there is little public evidence that company leaders slowed their stock selling. Now, corporate governance experts and some lawmakers say the trades could cast a shadow over Moderna, one of the biopharmaceutical industry\u2019s most remarkable stories. The questions come as the 10-year-old company is leading the race in the United States for a coronavirus vaccine \u2014 a feat rooted in a government partnership formed years ago that could change the path of a disease afflicting the world.ADADIn total, seven corporate executives and board members as well as a venture capital fund run by Moderna\u2019s board chairman collectively sold almost $101 million worth of stock following Clayton\u2019s comments. The trades were part of more than $200 million in sales by insiders since Moderna announced Jan. 21 that it was pursuing a vaccine in partnership with the National Institutes of Health. That\u2019s according to an analysis of SEC filings that the national executive compensation research firm Equilar performed at the request of The Washington Post \u2014 the first such comprehensive examination of the company\u2019s stock sales this year.Insiders selling included Moderna Chief Executive Officer St\u00e9phane Bancel, Chief Financial Officer Lorence Kim and Chief Medical Officer Tal Zaks. The trades were preprogrammed, according to the company\u2019s required public disclosure filings, meaning they were made in accordance with a predetermined schedule or triggering event such as a share-price threshold. Moderna said it will not disclose any details of the preprogrammed trading rules for its executives.On May 21 and 22, the co-founder and chairman of the company, Noubar Afeyan, reported selling $68 million worth of stock held by Flagship Pioneering, the venture capital fund he founded that is Moderna\u2019s largest shareholder. Afeyan did not sell any of his personal stock holdings in Moderna, according to Flagship and public filings. These trades were not preprogrammed, according to the company\u2019s public disclosures.ADADModerna\u2019s stock rose by 200 percent from January to June \u2014 as company news releases and news reports described early progress in its quest for a vaccine. In May, it was up as high as 300 percent after the release of the results of the clinical trial. The company made a public offering of stock on May 18 at the very peak of its share value.Stay safe and informed with our free Coronavirus Updates newsletterFederal securities law requires officers, directors and large shareholders of publicly traded companies to report their trades in company stock to the SEC. Companies typically prohibit sales of stock by executives for 180 days after the initial public offering, specialists said.The very first insider stock sales reported at Moderna occurred infrequently last fall, with the first in September 2019, 10 months after the company went public in a record-setting IPO in December 2018. Bancel began routinely selling shares starting in the fourth quarter of 2019 under his preprogrammed plan. The pace of selling picked up among Moderna\u2019s other executives in 2020, according to the public filings.ADAD\u201cExecutive sales are made under preplanned 10b5-1 plans, which are entered into during open trading windows in accordance with the company\u2019s insider trading policy,\u2019 \u201d said company spokesman Ray Jordan in an email. \u201cAs a matter of practice, Moderna does not intend to comment on any alleged or potential litigation or investigation; nor on purchases or sales by individual executives, investors or groups.\u201dModerna did not make company officials available for interviews.Bancel has a \u201clong-term commitment to Moderna and to the development of the \u2026 technologies being developed by the company,\u201d which he joined as its second employee nine years ago, Jordan added. \u201cHe has liquidated a small portion of his holdings each month through a planned 10b5-1 selling program. \u2026 Substantially all of his family\u2019s assets remain invested in Moderna.\u201dADADThe company has nearly 150 employees who operate under 10b5-1 plans, he added.Flagship spokesman Gregory Kelley said in an email that the fund\u2019s stock sales, which were not preprogrammed, \u201cwere made in accordance with [Moderna\u2019s] policies and during an open trading window as determined by [Moderna\u2019s] general counsel.\u201dExperts in securities law say the rules for preprogrammed stock trading plans are ambiguous enough that executives could gain unfair advantages, particularly when it comes to their control over the timing of release of market-moving data, and deserve scrutiny. The sales at Moderna in May raise potential concerns, the experts said.AD\u201cAll of the activity in the days leading up to the announcement and the offering, and the days following the announcement, are ripe fodder for SEC investigation,\u201d said Jacob S. Frenkel, a former top SEC investigator now in private practice as chair of government investigations and securities enforcement at the law firm Dickinson Wright. Frenkel said a likely subject of scrutiny would be what policies Moderna has for \u201cblackouts\u201d on executive trades during major news events and whether such policies were followed. The company said blackout dates are included in its insider trading policies, but the dates are not public.ADThe SEC said it would not comment. The agency typically does not publicly disclose whether it is investigating a company.Nell Minow, an expert in corporate governance and vice chair at ValueEdge Advisors, said it is inadvisable for Moderna\u2019s corporate insiders to be selling stock, particularly in the midst of major news about its leading product.AD\u201cIt can send the market a signal that is opposite to all of the positive things that they are trying to communicate,\u201d she said. \u201cBy definition, it is very concerning.\u201cWhether it is preprogrammed or not, it\u2019s hard to believe that anybody who thought the company was going to be tremendously successful with this vaccine would be selling,\u201d Minow said.Harvey Pitt, a former SEC chairman who now heads Kalorama Partners, told CNN in May that the timing of the trades was \u201chighly problematic\u201d and that the SEC should review communications inside the company to find out \u201cwhat was going on in people\u2019s minds before all these transactions.\u201dADBloomberg in May estimated Bancel\u2019s stake in the company as worth more than $2.2 billion, when measured at Moderna\u2019s peak stock price. He has sold about $17 million worth of shares since Jan. 21, according to the Equilar analysis. Flagship\u2019s 11 percent share of the company was worth $3.2 billion, Bloomberg said, and its sales of Moderna stock represented about 2 percent of that value. Given the large value of those holdings, the relatively small value of stock sales does not raise a major concern, said Jesse Fried, a Harvard Law School professor and expert on executive pay and insider trading.AD\u201cYou don\u2019t want to be exploiting a crisis to make money, but the truth is that any company that is going to sell the vaccine is going to be making money on the crisis,\u201d Fried said, \u201cand that\u2019s great, because we want to incentivize people to wake up early in the morning and stay in their labs late at night coming up with something that will help us.\u201dBut the Moderna sales are triggering political debate.AD\u201cModerna executives used this opportunity to capitalize on the covid-19 crisis, and to add insult to injury, the value of their stocks increased based on the taxpayer-funded investment in the development of the vaccine,\u201d Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md) said in an email. Van Hollen is the sponsor of legislation that would require the SEC to revisit its rules for preprogrammed insider trades.A fast responseThe enormous success of Moderna shows how pharmaceutical companies, often with help from the government, can achieve fantastic results even without delivering a product to market.ADIts speedy response to the covid-19 pandemic was enabled by its vaccine technology based on messenger RNA, which carries genetic codes instructing human cells to produce what is known as a \u201cspike protein\u201d molecule. The spike protein, which was invented jointly by scientists at the National Institutes of Health and the University of Texas at Austin, triggers the immune system to create antibodies against the coronavirus. The technology allowed Moderna in March to become the first company to test a vaccine in a human, just 66 days after the coronavirus genetic code was published.Even finding a covid-19 vaccine won\u2019t be enough to end the pandemicOn May 18, Moderna announced partial clinical results from 45 human test subjects suggesting the vaccine was safe and triggered an immune response. It said it measured neutralizing antibodies in eight test subjects, which was seen as early evidence that its vaccine may work. The news release did not contain detailed data from the patients in the trial, and crucial test results on some subjects were not available at the time the release was issued.ADThe news drove the share price to a record peak of $80. On that day, the chief financial officer, Kim, who is leaving the company in a previously planned departure, sold $19.5 million in shares in preprogrammed trades, according to public filings. In all since Jan. 21, Kim sold $54 million in shares, according to the Equilar analysis. As of June 2, he still held $70 million worth of shares.Minutes after the end of trading on May 18, Moderna announced it would issue $1.3 billion worth of new stock at $76 per share. The company said cash from the offering would be plowed into coronavirus vaccine manufacturing, including hiring 150 new production staff, as well as other company priorities. But as the stock dropped from its peak in subsequent days and weeks, plaintiff lawyers quickly announced that they would prepare class-action lawsuits, suggesting that the company\u2019s news release overhyped the data.Moderna said it \u201cworked cooperatively\u201d with NIH on the content of its news release and expects NIH to make detailed data from the Phase 1 trial public at a later date. NIH confirmed that it reviewed the data in the news release and said it was accurate.The chain of events in the midst of the pandemic has generated negative attention for a company that is competing with much larger corporations \u2014 including Pfizer, Merck, Johnson & Johnson, and AstraZeneca \u2014 to develop the first coronavirus vaccine.Unlike those companies, Moderna has no approved products and zero revenue stream from sales, according to the company\u2019s disclosure reports. Fifteen drugs in its pipeline, ranging from virus vaccines to heart treatments and a cancer vaccine, are still in early or mid-stage development.The company is built on the notion that cells inside the body can produce drugs and vaccines, if they are directed to do it by delivering the messenger RNA directly into the cells. Investors are wagering that Moderna\u2019s technology will work for other medicines down the road, including more viral targets and a cancer vaccine, say drug industry specialists.\u201cIf it works for this one virus, you can bet that it works for many, many others \u2026 and that kind of franchise will be incredibly valuable,\u201d said Andrew W. Lo, the Charles E. and Susan T. Harris professor of finance at the MIT Sloan School of Management, who does not have holdings in Moderna but who has personal investments and financial ties to other biotechnology companies and biotech venture capital funds.Trump pushing officials to speed up already-ambitious coronavirus vaccine timelineBetting on new technologyThe Cambridge, Mass., company, founded in 2010, has attracted more than $5 billion in private-sector investment, according to company figures, including partnerships with Merck and AstraZeneca, multiple rounds of venture capital financing, and public stock offerings worth about $2.5 billion. The company has $483 million in government commitments to develop a coronavirus vaccine but said it has not tapped the money yet. Over its history, Moderna has received about $77 million in funding for various projects, the company said.Moderna\u2019s rapid response gave it a leg up in the markets. Older vaccines relied on deactivated or weakened virus, grown in chicken eggs, in a slow process. The new breed of RNA vaccines like Moderna\u2019s can be designed on computers based on the genetic code of the virus and manufactured quickly. Pfizer also is working to develop an RNA-based coronavirus vaccine and began a Phase 1 trial in May.Still, the delivery system needs to be proved safe and effective in large numbers of people.\u201cThere is not a single drug approved with this technology. This is really the bet we are making, that all this is going to work,\u201d said Otello Stampacchia, the founder and managing director of Omega Funds, a life sciences venture capital firm in Boston.Years-old groundworkThe foundation of the Moderna vaccine was laid years before a mysterious respiratory illness was reported in Wuhan, China. In 2012, another deadly coronavirus, Middle East respiratory syndrome, jumped from camels into humans. Barney Graham, the deputy director of the federal Vaccine Research Center, which is part of NIH, said in an interview that he wanted to use cutting-edge technologies that examined the precise shape of a virus \u2014 down to individual atoms \u2014 to design a vaccine against the threat.But Graham and academic collaborators had to solve a problem. The target the scientists were interested in \u2014 the distinctive spiky protein on the virus surface \u2014 was unstable and tended to shape-shift.Nianshuang Wang, a postdoctoral researcher then at Dartmouth, spent months trying to identify genetic mutations that would stabilize the shape-shifting spike protein, eventually finding a solution that worked in multiple coronaviruses. The paper, published in 2017, took persistence to publish \u2014 it was rejected five times.\u201cPeople generally at that time said, \u2018Coronavirus is not a big concern,\u2019 \u201d Wang said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t get the idea that this can be a great technology in the future, to prevent another coronavirus pandemic.\u201dGraham was interested in using new technologies to speed up MERS vaccine development and in October 2017 began working with Moderna. The company\u2019s technology could deliver messenger RNA to normal human cells that instructs them to churn out the spike protein with the crucial mutations. The presence of the spike protein in the body triggers the creation of antibodies against the virus. But with MERS sparking only small, occasional outbreaks, it wasn\u2019t until January 2020 that the approach drew the world\u2019s attention.Before the pandemic, top contractor received billions from government to help prepare the nation for biowarfareEven before anyone knew for certain what was causing a mysterious pneumonia in Wuhan, Graham and Bancel began talking about working together. Graham also called Wang\u2019s boss, Jason McLellan, now at the University of Texas at Austin, to see if they could design a stabilized spike protein that could be used in a vaccine.Researchers in Graham\u2019s and McLellan\u2019s labs designed the protein through computer modeling in a single weekend. Moderna scientists helped finalize the genetic sequence for the vaccine platform they had spent years developing. Within days, the company began producing the coronavirus vaccine in a factory south of Boston. The NIH and UT Austin teams filed a joint patent application on the mutated spike protein. Moderna has a \u201cnonexclusive\u201d license to the protein, which means that NIH can license it to other companies, NIH said.In record time \u2014 66 days after the genome of a never-before-seen virus was posted on an online server \u2014 the first doses were injected into human beings through a clinical trial supported by more than $700,000 in federal funding. Moderna announced the beginning of a Phase 2 trial in May and said its Phase 3 trial in 30,000 subjects is scheduled to start in July.Bancel has said it may be known whether the vaccine works by Thanksgiving \u2014 a view echoed in an interview with Anthony S. Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.McLellan said his laboratory has created a second version of the spike protein that is even more potent and that it has already signed an agreement with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to ensure global access, which will enable companies with different technologies the ability to test and further develop potential covid-19 vaccines.Two months after the first human subject was dosed with the Moderna vaccine, the public got its first glimpse of its potential effectiveness.Before stock markets opened on May 18, Moderna issued a news release with positive but preliminary results of its Phase 1 safety trial. Eight trial subjects who received the vaccine had virus-fighting antibodies in their blood at levels similar or greater than people who have recovered from covid-19. Another 37 had promising immune responses, but tests were not available to see whether they had neutralizing antibodies.As soon as markets opened on May 18, Moderna\u2019s stock jumped. By the close of trading, it had risen more than 20 percent. But Moderna was criticized for releasing limited data by Fauci in an interview published by Stat on June 1.\u201cI didn\u2019t like that. What we would have preferred to do, quite frankly, is to wait until we had the data from the entire Phase 1 \u2014 which I hear is quite similar to the data that they showed \u2014 and publish it in a reputable journal and show all the data,\u201d he told Stat. \u201cBut the company, when they looked at the data, as all companies do, they said, wow, this is exciting. Let\u2019s put out a press release.\u201dTwo days later, Bancel offered an explanation for the company\u2019s actions. A concern about leaks drove the decision to issue early information, he said in a June 3 video hosted by the Wall Street investment banking firm Jefferies that was publicly posted online.Moderna had received preliminary data from NIH, which sponsored the Phase 1 trial, on May 14, Bancel said. The next day, Moncef Slaoui, a Moderna board member who had just left the company to go to the White House and assume leadership of President Trump\u2019s Operation Warp Speed initiative to develop vaccines, expressed confidence in a Rose Garden news conference that a vaccine could be ready by the end of 2020. Slaoui said from the lectern that he had just seen positive data from a vaccine manufacturer. Slaoui did not identify the trial or manufacturer.Moderna determined that too many people knew about the data, Bancel said, and that the company needed to publicly release limited results to level the playing field for all investors.\u201cI have no idea if tomorrow it\u2019s going to be tweeted by somebody, it\u2019s going to be mentioned at a conference, on TV,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s a risk our legal team said you cannot take.\u201d", "comment": "258 Comments", "topic": "Business"}, {"cover": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/CFD4X4GFZ4I6VKBFQ4RAATSBKA.jpghttps://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/CFD4X4GFZ4I6VKBFQ4RAATSBKA.jpg", "title": "The Daily 202: Trump\u2019s coronavirus blame game is part of a pattern from the White House", "date": "Jul 14, 2020", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/the-daily-202-trumps-coronavirus-blame-game-is-part-of-a-pattern-from-the-white-house/2020/07/14/7a4aedb2-f0a6-4edf-9815-cd8cea14d309_story.html", "keyword": "China and Security", "website": "the Washington Post", "author": "Carol D.

Subscribe today.arrow-rightOver the past five days, the United States has suffered a worsening resurgence of coronavirus cases indicating that \u2014 after six months \u2014 the most powerful country in the world has made little progress in controlling the virus and that Americans may indefinitely remain its prisoners.President Trump, meanwhile, has been largely MIA on a question most citizens expect their president to address: What does he plan to do now to better protect the public health and return the country to normalcy?ADThe American people heard little from their president over the weekend on the worrisome infections spreading throughout the South and West.ADFrom Thursday to today, Trump apparently preferred to spend his time on other things.\u00a0He wiped away the prison sentence of his convicted political adviser Roger Stone and golfed two days in a row at his Trump National Golf Club on the banks of the Potomac River. The president sent out dozens of tweets, including some that threatened 10-year prison sentences for protesters who defile federal monuments and statues, defended his border wall, and congratulated his Fox News booster Sean Hannity for a \u201cbig night\u201d of viewer ratings on Thursday night, when Trump was his guest.Trump has increasingly sidestepped responsibility for leading a coordinated federal response.\u00a0That behavior fits a pattern in Trump's presidency in which the president seemingly has no interest in or patience for what he considers the boring work of governing, several of his former senior advisers say, speaking on the condition of anonymity. He was not fully engaged for the hard work of defusing the pandemic, including listening to panels of experts, sifting through scientific models and making hard choices to craft a whole-of-government response, an option not seriously considered.Trump's attempts to contain the virus have always been tentative.In early spring, as his advisers pushed the reluctant president to deem the virus a public health emergency, Trump tried marketing, taking to the White House lectern almost daily to talk about the \u201cgreat\u201d job his administration was doing to tackle the disease, despite a botched testing launch that put the country way behind the curve in containment. \u00a0Trump still routinely pans testing as a \u201cdouble-edged sword,\u201d arguing it only increases the number of confirmed cases and makes his administration \u201clook bad,\u201d while \u00a0simultaneously vowing an imminent vaccine. He then tried saddling governors with the responsibility of tamping down the crisis, while calling to \u201cLIBERATE!\u201d states that wouldn't move to reopen quickly enough. Now, he is saying schools should move to fully reopen this fall despite major pushback from local officials and teachers unions.ADADThat\u2019s come into sharp relief again in the past five days, as the rate of coronavirus infections is setting records, suggesting \u00a0America is back to square one in this health crisis.\u00a0Coronavirus deaths are on the rise in every region of the country. As happened in early spring, the volume of new cases is rising so fast, particularly in the Sun Belt, that testing can\u2019t keep up. Receiving rapid test results, quarantining the sick and controlling the virus's spread is proving nearly impossible.\u00a0Several major school systems and colleges in California are retrenching on their plans to reopen this fall, and announced they will instead have online classes only for the time being. CEOs are preparing for employees to continue working remotely indefinitely after Labor Day, as well.\u00a0The worsening pandemic cries out for concrete steps from the federal government. But Trump has stubbornly sought to shift the blame for the situation and sees himself as the victim of an unfortunate convergence of circumstances.\u00a0Trump\u2019s most recent fall guy is Anthony S. Fauci.Though never entirely on the same page as his top infectious-disease specialist, the president appeared with Fauci at coronavirus task force briefings, and the two seemed to be communicating earlier in the crisis. But things have clearly changed between the two men, with Trump apparently viewing Fauci\u2019s grim message about burgeoning cases and the dangers of reopening as a threat. In the midst of the most perilous public health threat in a century, the president hasn\u2019t met with Fauci in over a month. The doctor slipped into the White House yesterday, however, to meet with Chief of Staff Mark Meadows as criticism of the administration's bashing of him intensified.In the past five days, as the news has grown more dire and Fauci has refused to sugarcoat it, Trump and his allies have sought to cast Fauci as\u00a0error-prone.ADADIn his Thursday interview with Hannity, Trump criticized Fauci as a nice guy who has nevertheless \u201cmade a lot of mistakes.\u201d By Monday, Trump\u2019s souring on the doctor\u00a0had become part of a larger concerted campaign within the White House. A senior White House official anonymously gave reporters opposition-research-style bullet points of comments Fauci made about the virus that were described as misleading or inaccurate. They included Fauci\u2019s early advice that people who didn\u2019t feel sick need not wear masks and should preserve the supply for medical workers, and Fauci typically cautioned the situation was evolving.The White House list doesn\u2019t mention Trump's repeated inaccurate and misleading comments about the virus and the government's response, including his claim the U.S. could reopen safely by Easter or his recommendation that people with covid-19 could get better by taking hydroxychloroquine or possibly by being treated with bleach or ultraviolet light. The list didn\u2019t mention when Trump in January insisted the coronavirus was \u201ctotally under control\u201d and would create only a few U.S. cases, or when he said the number of cases would \u201cgo down to zero.\u201d\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s going to disappear,\u201d Trump said Feb. 28. \u201cOne day it\u2019s like a miracle, it will disappear.\u201dADADThe campaign of presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden on Monday attacked Trump\u2019s effort to blame Fauci.\u201cOver 135,000 Americans have lost their lives and tens of millions have lost their jobs because Donald Trump spent the last six months disastrously mismanaging the worst public health crisis in a century, the whole time failing to heed the warnings and guidance of medical experts \u2014 particularly Dr. Fauci,\u201d Biden campaign spokesman Andrew Bates said.\u00a0So much of Trump\u2019s response is part of the playbook he deployed during the first three years of his presidency.\u00a0Trump finds governing tedious, several of his senior former advisers have said. He likes to make decisions on impulse, and later, if those decisions blow up in his face, he tends to blame others for making them.ADThough Trump repeatedly praised his defense secretary Jim Mattis as one of his best Cabinet picks ever, he later concluded the four-star general was \u201coverrated\u201d after he resigned in protest of Trump\u2019s decision to pull U.S. soldiers out of Syria. Trump made the decision on the fly during a phone call when Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan asked him to leave Syria. Mattis felt it was militarily unwise to exit the battlefield, which would just allow Islamic State factions to regain their strongholds. He also considered it unethical to leave America's Kurdish allies in danger, and inexplicable for Trump to grant this gift to Erdogan without any benefit to the United States.\u00a0ADWhen Trump was in Paris in November 2018 and didn\u2019t want to go to a sacred memorial to fallen American soldiers in World War II, he asked his chief of staff John Kelly and another aide for options. They said he could blame his absence on weather; it would be difficult to clear the streets for his motorcade at the last minute and potentially worrisome to fly by helicopter. But when Trump got terrible press for skipping the event, with some critics asking if he didn\u2019t want to get his hair wet,\u00a0Trump blamed Kelly, saying he should have talked him into attending.\u201cHe never apologizes,\u201d said one former senior adviser who left the Trump administration. \u201cIt\u2019s always somebody else\u2019s fault. He can\u2019t take responsibility for any decision.\u201d\u00a0ADThis March, Trump blamed the rules and regulations from the Obama administration for his administration\u2019s inability to test enough Americans for the virus to control its spread at a critical early stage. He didn\u2019t mention that he and his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, had feared that such rapid, emergency testing might be bad for the markets and the economy.AD\u201cI don't take responsibility at all,\u201d Trump said.Governing is boring, hard, uncertain. Blaming is infinitely easier.Quote of the day\u201cIt\u2019s shocking,\u201d said Janis Orlowski, chief health-care officer of the Association of American Medical Colleges and one of many academics and researchers who rallied to defend Fauci from White House attacks. \u201cWhen you begin to discredit scientists like Fauci, who are national treasures, you are in serious trouble.\u201d (Laurie McGinley and Yasmeen Abutaleb)More on the coronavirusThe White House will ask states to consider calling up the National Guard to help with data collection. \u00a0\u201cA letter, to be sent to governors imminently, backs away from earlier drafts as recently as Friday that had directed state leaders to deploy the National Guard to help hospitals with daily data submissions. It now includes the National Guard among states\u2019 options for improving the data flow, according to two senior administration officials and one industry official who was informed Monday about the final version,\u201d Lena Sun and Amy Goldstein report. \u201cStill, even the possibility of National Guard involvement has infuriated hospital industry leaders, who say any data collection problems lie primarily with the Department of Health and Human Services and repeatedly changing federal instructions.\"Schools in Los Angeles, San Diego and Atlanta will remain closed in the fall, teaching entirely online.\u00a0\u201cSchools in Nashville plan to do the same, at least through Labor Day. Several other big cities were considering similar plans, while others have adopted hybrid plans where students will be in school on certain days and at home on others. Some have announced plans to open five days a week, as the White House has demanded, but they appear to be in the minority,\u201d Laura Meckler reports. \u201cAt the White House Monday, Trump again pressed his case for in-person learning. \u2018Schools should be opened,\u2019 he said when asked for his message to worried parents. \u2018Schools should be opened. Kids want to go to school. You\u2019re losing a lot of lives by keeping things closed.'\"Trump is pushing colleges to reopen. Their health centers aren't prepared to handle the crisis. \u00a0\u201cAs millions go back to school during the pandemic, the ability of campus health services to safeguard and care for students will be tested as never before \u2014 and many colleges appear unprepared for the challenge. To assess the landscape of student health services at roughly 1,700 four-year residential campuses, The Post interviewed more than 200 students, parents and health officials and examined thousands of pages of medical records and court documents and 5,500 reviews of student health centers posted on Google,\u201d Jenn Abelson, Nicole Dungca, Meryl Kornfield and Andrew Ba Tran report. \u201cCollege students reported they commonly waited days or weeks for appointments and were routinely provided lackluster care. Dozens of students ended up hospitalized \u2014 and some near death \u2014 for mistakes they said were made at on-campus clinics \u2026 Many students, including low-income individuals on Medicaid, said they avoided seeking treatment altogether because the care was too costly.\u201dCalifornia Gov.

Virginia, West Virginia, Alaska, Missouri, Hawaii, Rhode Island and Minnesota all saw the average rate of new infections rise between 41 and 55 percent compared with the week of July 6. Colorado, Kentucky, the District of Columbia, Montana, North Dakota and the Virgin Islands saw increases of average new infections at a rate of 63 percent or higher. Sparsely populated North Dakota had a particularly intense week, with the number of infections nearly doubling from 44 to 84.\u201dAmericans\u2019 use of masks varies greatly by demographics, a Gallup poll found.The poll found less than half of Americans are following health officials\u2019 guidance and always covering their nose and mouth while in public.

Majorities of women (54 percent), Democrats (61 percent) and Northeasterners (54 percent) say they always use masks outside their homes, while their counterparts do so less often. A majority of Republicans \u2014 54 percent \u2014 said they wear masks infrequently, including 27 percent who said they never do.\u00a0ADADSen.

Another analysis, published Monday by the Urban Institute and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, projected that by the end of 2020, 10.1 million people will no longer have employer-sponsored health insurance or coverage that was tied to a job they lost because of the pandemic.\u201d \u00a0Workers are being pushed to the brink as they continue to wait for their delayed unemployment checks.\u00a0\u201cAlexis Herdez has been filing for unemployment every week since April, shortly after she was laid off on her first day of work at a bridal clothing store. But more than two months later, the 23-year-old in Lexington, Ky., has yet to receive any payment,\u201d Eli Rosenberg reports. \u201cFour months into the worst recession since the Great Depression, tens of thousands of workers like Herdez across the country have filed for jobless claims but have yet to receive payments. Many are now in dire financial straits. \u2018We\u2019ve been only able to make half payments on everything,\u2019 Herdez said \u2026 \u2018We bought a large amount of groceries and have been taking things out of the freezer, but as the weeks go by, it\u2019s hard to figure out whether to pay bills or whether we have enough food to last the week.\u2019 \u2026 The ongoing delays are the result of a confluence of crises, experts say. A flood of new jobless applications \u2014 about 50 million \u2014 has overwhelmed state unemployment offices over the past four months.

The amount of tax revenue collected by the federal government remained largely flat, at about $240 billion, in part because the Treasury Department delayed the tax filing deadline until July. The huge surge in June pushed the budget deficit for the first nine months of the fiscal year to $2.7 trillion.\"Small-business owners are giving up.\u201cThe resurgence of the virus, especially in states such as Texas, Florida and California that had begun to reopen, has introduced a far darker reality for many small businesses: Their temporary closures might become permanent.

Some copies already have been distributed, and the work is already considered a bestseller. \u2026 Mary Trump, 55, was sued by her uncle Robert Trump, the president\u2019s brother, in an effort to block publication. He had accused her of violating a confidentiality agreement in an inheritance case settled two decades ago. \u2026 In Dutchess County, N.Y., Justice Hal Greenwald said that Simon & Schuster had no obligations under the family\u2019s nondisclosure agreement and that constitutional law \u2018trumps contracts.\u2019 \u2026\u00a0Trump was granted a second 45-day extension to file his personal financial disclosure forms.\u00a0\u201cThe forms are supposed to detail Trump\u2019s income, debt, stock holdings and outstanding loans for 2019. They were originally due May 15, but Trump got an extension until the end of June,\u201d David Fahrenthold and Anu Narayanswamy report. \u201cOn June 29, Scott Gast, deputy counsel to the president, granted Trump a second extension, until Aug. 13, according to the letter. Federal law allows only two such extensions. Gast\u2019s letter said that the extension was given for \u2018good cause,\u2019 but did not specify what that cause was. A White House spokesperson said Trump \u2018has a complicated report, and he\u2019s been focused on addressing the coronavirus and other matters.\u2019\u201dHouse Democrats will revive a legal effort to get Trump\u2019s financial records.\u00a0\u201cIn a\u00a0filing late Monday, the House\u2019s top lawyer, Douglas Letter, urged the [Supreme Court] to immediately effectuate their July 9 ruling on the House\u2019s subpoena for Trump\u2019s records. Once the ruling is in force, the House can return to the U.S. District Court judge who initially heard the case and ask for renewed consideration,\u201d Politico reports. Last week, \u201cthe justices devised a four-part test to determine whether an effort by Congress to obtain the personal papers of a sitting president is proper \u2013 and they urged the lower courts to apply this test on any future attempt by lawmakers to get [the records] \u2026 Letter noted that the [ruling] would normally take effect on Aug. 3 without the intervention of the justices. The lower courts can\u2019t begin to take up the effort until the Supreme Court ruling takes hold, and the House is urging the justices to make that happen as quickly as possible.\u201d\u00a0More Republicans are dropping out of the Jacksonville convention.\u201cSenators Roy Blunt of Missouri and Pat Roberts of Kansas are planning to skip the Republican National Convention next month,\u201d the Times reports. \u201cRepresentatives Mario Diaz-Balart and Francis Rooney of Florida are sticking with their plans not to attend, even though the convention is now in their home state.

Neither has John Thune of South Dakota, the second-ranking Senate Republican, or Representative Liz Cheney of Wyoming, the third-ranking House Republican. \u2026 \u2018Everybody just assumes no one is going,\u2019 said Representative Darin LaHood of Illinois, an honorary state co-chairman for the Trump campaign.

Subscribe today.arrow-rightOver the past five days, the United States has suffered a worsening resurgence of coronavirus cases indicating that \u2014 after six months \u2014 the most powerful country in the world has made little progress in controlling the virus and that Americans may indefinitely remain its prisoners.President Trump, meanwhile, has been largely MIA on a question most citizens expect their president to address: What does he plan to do now to better protect the public health and return the country to normalcy?ADThe American people heard little from their president over the weekend on the worrisome infections spreading throughout the South and West.ADFrom Thursday to today, Trump apparently preferred to spend his time on other things.\u00a0He wiped away the prison sentence of his convicted political adviser Roger Stone and golfed two days in a row at his Trump National Golf Club on the banks of the Potomac River. The president sent out dozens of tweets, including some that threatened 10-year prison sentences for protesters who defile federal monuments and statues, defended his border wall, and congratulated his Fox News booster Sean Hannity for a \u201cbig night\u201d of viewer ratings on Thursday night, when Trump was his guest.Trump has increasingly sidestepped responsibility for leading a coordinated federal response.\u00a0That behavior fits a pattern in Trump's presidency in which the president seemingly has no interest in or patience for what he considers the boring work of governing, several of his former senior advisers say, speaking on the condition of anonymity. He was not fully engaged for the hard work of defusing the pandemic, including listening to panels of experts, sifting through scientific models and making hard choices to craft a whole-of-government response, an option not seriously considered.Trump's attempts to contain the virus have always been tentative.In early spring, as his advisers pushed the reluctant president to deem the virus a public health emergency, Trump tried marketing, taking to the White House lectern almost daily to talk about the \u201cgreat\u201d job his administration was doing to tackle the disease, despite a botched testing launch that put the country way behind the curve in containment. \u00a0Trump still routinely pans testing as a \u201cdouble-edged sword,\u201d arguing it only increases the number of confirmed cases and makes his administration \u201clook bad,\u201d while \u00a0simultaneously vowing an imminent vaccine. He then tried saddling governors with the responsibility of tamping down the crisis, while calling to \u201cLIBERATE!\u201d states that wouldn't move to reopen quickly enough. Now, he is saying schools should move to fully reopen this fall despite major pushback from local officials and teachers unions.ADADThat\u2019s come into sharp relief again in the past five days, as the rate of coronavirus infections is setting records, suggesting \u00a0America is back to square one in this health crisis.\u00a0Coronavirus deaths are on the rise in every region of the country. As happened in early spring, the volume of new cases is rising so fast, particularly in the Sun Belt, that testing can\u2019t keep up. Receiving rapid test results, quarantining the sick and controlling the virus's spread is proving nearly impossible.\u00a0Several major school systems and colleges in California are retrenching on their plans to reopen this fall, and announced they will instead have online classes only for the time being. CEOs are preparing for employees to continue working remotely indefinitely after Labor Day, as well.\u00a0The worsening pandemic cries out for concrete steps from the federal government. But Trump has stubbornly sought to shift the blame for the situation and sees himself as the victim of an unfortunate convergence of circumstances.\u00a0Trump\u2019s most recent fall guy is Anthony S. Fauci.Though never entirely on the same page as his top infectious-disease specialist, the president appeared with Fauci at coronavirus task force briefings, and the two seemed to be communicating earlier in the crisis. But things have clearly changed between the two men, with Trump apparently viewing Fauci\u2019s grim message about burgeoning cases and the dangers of reopening as a threat. In the midst of the most perilous public health threat in a century, the president hasn\u2019t met with Fauci in over a month. The doctor slipped into the White House yesterday, however, to meet with Chief of Staff Mark Meadows as criticism of the administration's bashing of him intensified.In the past five days, as the news has grown more dire and Fauci has refused to sugarcoat it, Trump and his allies have sought to cast Fauci as\u00a0error-prone.ADADIn his Thursday interview with Hannity, Trump criticized Fauci as a nice guy who has nevertheless \u201cmade a lot of mistakes.\u201d By Monday, Trump\u2019s souring on the doctor\u00a0had become part of a larger concerted campaign within the White House. A senior White House official anonymously gave reporters opposition-research-style bullet points of comments Fauci made about the virus that were described as misleading or inaccurate. They included Fauci\u2019s early advice that people who didn\u2019t feel sick need not wear masks and should preserve the supply for medical workers, and Fauci typically cautioned the situation was evolving.The White House list doesn\u2019t mention Trump's repeated inaccurate and misleading comments about the virus and the government's response, including his claim the U.S. could reopen safely by Easter or his recommendation that people with covid-19 could get better by taking hydroxychloroquine or possibly by being treated with bleach or ultraviolet light. The list didn\u2019t mention when Trump in January insisted the coronavirus was \u201ctotally under control\u201d and would create only a few U.S. cases, or when he said the number of cases would \u201cgo down to zero.\u201d\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s going to disappear,\u201d Trump said Feb. 28. \u201cOne day it\u2019s like a miracle, it will disappear.\u201dADADThe campaign of presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden on Monday attacked Trump\u2019s effort to blame Fauci.\u201cOver 135,000 Americans have lost their lives and tens of millions have lost their jobs because Donald Trump spent the last six months disastrously mismanaging the worst public health crisis in a century, the whole time failing to heed the warnings and guidance of medical experts \u2014 particularly Dr. Fauci,\u201d Biden campaign spokesman Andrew Bates said.\u00a0So much of Trump\u2019s response is part of the playbook he deployed during the first three years of his presidency.\u00a0Trump finds governing tedious, several of his senior former advisers have said. He likes to make decisions on impulse, and later, if those decisions blow up in his face, he tends to blame others for making them.ADThough Trump repeatedly praised his defense secretary Jim Mattis as one of his best Cabinet picks ever, he later concluded the four-star general was \u201coverrated\u201d after he resigned in protest of Trump\u2019s decision to pull U.S. soldiers out of Syria. Trump made the decision on the fly during a phone call when Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan asked him to leave Syria. Mattis felt it was militarily unwise to exit the battlefield, which would just allow Islamic State factions to regain their strongholds. He also considered it unethical to leave America's Kurdish allies in danger, and inexplicable for Trump to grant this gift to Erdogan without any benefit to the United States.\u00a0ADWhen Trump was in Paris in November 2018 and didn\u2019t want to go to a sacred memorial to fallen American soldiers in World War II, he asked his chief of staff John Kelly and another aide for options. They said he could blame his absence on weather; it would be difficult to clear the streets for his motorcade at the last minute and potentially worrisome to fly by helicopter. But when Trump got terrible press for skipping the event, with some critics asking if he didn\u2019t want to get his hair wet,\u00a0Trump blamed Kelly, saying he should have talked him into attending.\u201cHe never apologizes,\u201d said one former senior adviser who left the Trump administration. \u201cIt\u2019s always somebody else\u2019s fault. He can\u2019t take responsibility for any decision.\u201d\u00a0ADThis March, Trump blamed the rules and regulations from the Obama administration for his administration\u2019s inability to test enough Americans for the virus to control its spread at a critical early stage.

It now includes the National Guard among states\u2019 options for improving the data flow, according to two senior administration officials and one industry official who was informed Monday about the final version,\u201d Lena Sun and Amy Goldstein report. \u201cStill, even the possibility of National Guard involvement has infuriated hospital industry leaders, who say any data collection problems lie primarily with the Department of Health and Human Services and repeatedly changing federal instructions.\"Schools in Los Angeles, San Diego and Atlanta will remain closed in the fall, teaching entirely online.\u00a0\u201cSchools in Nashville plan to do the same, at least through Labor Day.

Their health centers aren't prepared to handle the crisis. \u00a0\u201cAs millions go back to school during the pandemic, the ability of campus health services to safeguard and care for students will be tested as never before \u2014 and many colleges appear unprepared for the challenge. To assess the landscape of student health services at roughly 1,700 four-year residential campuses, The Post interviewed more than 200 students, parents and health officials and examined thousands of pages of medical records and court documents and 5,500 reviews of student health centers posted on Google,\u201d Jenn Abelson, Nicole Dungca, Meryl Kornfield and Andrew Ba Tran report. \u201cCollege students reported they commonly waited days or weeks for appointments and were routinely provided lackluster care. Dozens of students ended up hospitalized \u2014 and some near death \u2014 for mistakes they said were made at on-campus clinics \u2026 Many students, including low-income individuals on Medicaid, said they avoided seeking treatment altogether because the care was too costly.\u201dCalifornia Gov.

The amount of tax revenue collected by the federal government remained largely flat, at about $240 billion, in part because the Treasury Department delayed the tax filing deadline until July.

He had accused her of violating a confidentiality agreement in an inheritance case settled two decades ago. \u2026 In Dutchess County, N.Y., Justice Hal Greenwald said that Simon & Schuster had no obligations under the family\u2019s nondisclosure agreement and that constitutional law \u2018trumps contracts.\u2019 \u2026\u00a0Trump was granted a second 45-day extension to file his personal financial disclosure forms.\u00a0\u201cThe forms are supposed to detail Trump\u2019s income, debt, stock holdings and outstanding loans for 2019.

The New York Times first reported \u2014 with The Washington Post and others confirming \u2014 that U.S. intelligence has assessed that a Russian military spy unit offered bounties to Taliban-linked fighters in Afghanistan to kill coalition troops, including American ones. The Post further reported that the bounties have indeed been linked to U.S. troop deaths.Support our journalism. Subscribe today.arrow-rightThere has been intense debate within the intelligence community, dating back to March, about how to respond. Three months later, though, the Trump administration still hasn\u2019t responded. In the intervening period, Trump has described Russia and Putin as friends of the United States, has sent humanitarian aid to Russia and has continued to push for its inclusion into the Group of Seven summit.ADADSince the news broke, Trump has also repeatedly dismissed the bounties story as a \u201choax\u201d \u2014 breaking with many in his own party who are taking it seriously, as well as with administration officials who have suggested that the intelligence is still being analyzed.The potential scandal here is readily apparent: the idea that a president and an administration would do nothing about an antagonistic foreign power funding the killing of Americans.There\u2019s still plenty we don\u2019t know, including which attacks on U.S. troops might have been linked to the bounties. But below is a timeline of what we know, when it happened and what Trump has done vis-a-vis Russia since the intelligence community\u2019s conclusion.ADApril 2017: Army Gen. John Nicholson, the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan, appears to confirm reports that Russia is arming the Taliban. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis adds, \u201cAny weapons being funneled here from a foreign country would be a violation of international law unless they were coming to the government of Afghanistan.\u201dADFebruary 2018: U.S. troops and their Syrian allies kill about 100 people, including Russian mercenaries who were working for an oligarch close to Putin, Yevgeniy Prigozhin, after coming under attack. The event marks the deadliest clash between Americans and Russians since the Cold War ended three decades earlier. U.S. officials have indicated that the bounties might have been in retaliation for this, according to The Post.March 2018: Nicholson again cites \u201cdestabilizing activity by the Russians\u201d in Afghanistan. The Taliban and Russia say the claim is baseless.ADApril 2019: Three U.S. Marines are killed and three service members wounded in an attack on an American convoy returning to Bagram air base in Afghanistan. The Taliban claims responsibility. Intelligence officials believe this to have been part of the Russian bounty program, according to Washington Post sources. The attack has also been connected to the bounties reported by the Associated Press.ADEarly 2019: The White House is first made aware of intelligence suggesting Russia was offering bounties, according to Washington Post reporting. The intelligence, which came from Afghan militants and indicated that the bounties might have dated back as early as 2018, is discussed within the White House\u2019s National Security Council. The intelligence community and U.S. Central Command are told to find out more before any action is taken.October 2019: Russia joins the United States, China and Pakistan in signing a statement on peace in Afghanistan.ADEarly 2020: SEAL Team 6 raids a Taliban outpost and recovers $500,000 in cash \u2014 an event which affirmed the intelligence community\u2019s suspicions about Russia paying bounties.February: Allegations of Russia\u2019s bounties again make their way to the National Security Council.ADFeb. 29: The United States strikes an initial peace deal with the Taliban, which includes a full withdrawal of U.S. forces in 14 months. But Taliban-linked groups would fail to comply with the deal, and further planned peace talks have yet to materialize.Late March: U.S. intelligence holds a large interagency meeting to discuss the intelligence on Russia\u2019s alleged bounties. The CIA would ultimately conclude that the information was credible and that there was little doubt Russia was targeting U.S. troops, while the National Security Agency would take a more skeptical view. The New York Times reported that Trump had been briefed on the matter at this time, which Trump and the White House deny. But sources have confirmed the information was contained in Trump\u2019s written President\u2019s Daily Brief (or PDB), which Trump reportedly rarely, if ever, reads. The administration still hasn\u2019t lodged an official response to the alleged bounties.ADApril 18: Trump says, \u201cI have a very good relationship with Putin.\u201dADMay: A converted version of the intelligence is distributed in the Wire, a regular CIA report that can be accessed by other government agencies and certain congressional offices.May 8: Trump says of Russia: \u201cWe had no calls from Russia for years. And all of a sudden, we have this great friendship. And, by the way, getting along with Russia is a great thing, getting along with Putin and Russia is a great thing.\u201dMay 8: Trump speaks with Putin and offers to send ventilators to help Russia fight the coronavirus outbreak there. The United States will send 200 ventilators as part of a $5.6 million humanitarian package.ADMay 21: Trump says: \u201cRussia and us have developed a very good relationship. As you know, we worked on the oil problem together. I think we have a very good relationship with Russia.\u201dADMay 30: Trump postpones the G-7 summit and renews his calls for Russia to be reinstated into it.June 5: Trump says of the ventilators, \u201cWe\u2019re sending some to Russia. It\u2019s good for relationship. It\u2019s good for everything.\u201dLate June: Britain is informed of the intelligence on Russia\u2019s bounties, given that its troops could also have been targets. Other coalition members are not informed.June 24: Trump attacks the Obama administration for allegedly having been weak on Russia. After Polish President Andrzej Duda brings up Russia\u2019s 2014 annexation of Crimea from Ukraine, Trump says, \u201cI just want to add: 2014, which the president was talking about \u2014 that was a year where Russia had a good time with the United States. To the best of my knowledge, President Obama and Sleepy Joe Biden, they were in power. They were the ones that were doing it. This was before us. It hasn\u2019t happened with us, and it won\u2019t happen with us, either.\u201dADADJune 25: One day before news of the Russian bounties and the lack of a U.S. response breaks, Trump repeats his claim to having been tough on Russia. \u201cI was tougher on Russia than any president that\u2019s ever lived \u2014 any president,\u201d Trump tells Fox News Channel\u2019s Sean Hannity. \u201cNobody has done what I\u2019ve done with sanctions and all.\u201dJune 26: The New York Times breaks the news about Russia\u2019s bounties. It would soon be confirmed by The Post, the Associated Press and others.June 28: Trump claims in a tweet responding to the reports, \u201cIntel just reported to me that they did not find this info credible, and therefore did not report it to me or @VP\u201d Mike Pence. Trump adds that it\u2019s \u201cPossibly another fabricated Russia Hoax.\u201dJune 29: Congressional Republicans are briefed on the intelligence at the White House, with many of them, unlike Trump, expressing grave concerns about it.ADADJune 30: Congressional Democrats are briefed, but say they weren\u2019t provided much information besides the White House\u2019s spin.July 1: Trump again repeatedly calls the situation a \u201choax,\u201d both in tweets and an interview with Fox Business Network. \u201cFrom what I hear, and I hear it pretty good, the intelligence people didn\u2019t even \u2014 many of them didn\u2019t believe it happened at all.

With domestic policy grabbing much attention, it tries to stake out the terms of a debate over what progressive foreign policy might look like in the Biden administration, should he get elected.ADThe letter \u2014 which is signed by organizations that include Win Without War, J Street, Indivisible, MoveOn, Justice Democrats, and Demand Progress \u2014 calls on Biden to undertake a \u201cfundamental re-envisioning of the United States\u2019 role in the world.\u201dADTo that end, it lays out numerous principles that signatories hope Biden will adhere to, many of which amount to a robust vision of what\u2019s sometimes called progressive internationalism.For instance, it demands that matters requiring international attention and cooperation among countries \u2014 mass global inequality, climate change, global white nationalist movements, rising international authoritarianism \u2014 be treated as national security challenges.ADRelated to this is the letter\u2019s demand that Biden pledge to prioritize international cooperation over the sort of \u201cgreat power competition\u201d that we\u2019re drifting back into during the Trump era.Also called for is an \u201cembrace of reducing the Pentagon\u2019s budget\u201d to shift priorities towards peace building and diplomacy as the \u201cprimary tools to address violence and violent conflict,\u201d including terrorism.ADThe letter also asks Biden to refrain from staffing foreign policy positions with people who have supported CIA torture programs, opposed the release during the Barack Obama presidency of a Senate report on those programs, supported Israeli settlements, and backed \u201ccovert policies that resulted in  civilian harm\u201d (this might include prominent advocates for Obama\u2019s targeted killing program, which did cause civilian casualties).ADThe letter concludes:A potential Biden administration presents an opportunity to begin to challenge the institutions and groupthink that have led to a disastrous, overly-militarized, unilateral approach to foreign affairs, and put the United States in a position to credibly lead on addressing the existential threats the world faces in the coming century.All this points to the complex position Biden occupies in relation to foreign policy progressives. Biden supported the Iraq War, which associated him with an older-line and more hawkish foreign policy establishment whose failures Obama ran against in 2008 (before disappointing progressives with his record on drones, war powers and other matters).Yet Biden also was involved in negotiating the Iran nuclear deal. Many progressives regard this as a crowning internationalist achievement and a realization of the good side of Obama\u2019s vision, which was shaped in reaction to Iraq, with the goal of moving past \u201cthe mindset that got us into war in the first place,\u201d as Obama put it in 2008.ADADThis tension was well articulated by Matt Duss, an adviser to Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who clashed with Biden in the primaries over Iraq. As Duss noted, Biden still must \u201cshow that he has grappled with the consequences of that war,\u201d but at the same time, he was \u201con the more restraint-oriented side\u201d of numerous key foreign policy debates during the Obama years.This letter seems designed to create a framework with which Biden can be pinned down more precisely on many of these matters.The other key context here is that foreign policy progressives has come a long way in the past two decades. The antiwar movement that sprung up in reaction to Iraq and George W. Bush\u2019s \u201cwar on terrorism,\u201d evolved further with its organizing on behalf of the Iran nuclear deal.ADForeign policy progressives have since demonstrated still more reach and depth by helping to corral virtually all congressional Democrats into opposing Trump over U.S. support for the Saudi-led war in Yemen, which has unleashed a humanitarian catastrophe.ADSo this letter is also a first volley in foreign policy progressives\u2019 effort  to exert real influence over a Biden administration, and to show that it has become a major presence to be reckoned with.Read more:George F.

Subscribe today.arrow-rightAt a moment when many communities of color are calling for greater input in public policy, President Trump is seeking to overhaul one of the nation's most powerful environmental laws in a way that could minimize their voices.On Wednesday, the president is slated to finalize changes to the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), which requires the federal government to analyze how a major decision affects the environment and take public comment. Trump will travel to Atlanta to make the case that scaling back the 50 year-old statute will speed the construction of highways, pipelines and other infrastructure projects across the country. His cheerleading for a robust economic rebound comes in the midst of the novel coronavirus pandemic that continues to set new infection records.NEPA has emerged as a major legal counterweight to the Trump administration\u2019s policy agenda.\u00a0And it's one of the most effective ways Americans of color have pushed back against plans that could harm their health and environment. Business groups and some unions, however, argue that it is a burdensome and complex law that has exponentially increased the cost and time it takes to modernize America\u2019s infrastructure.ADADAsked about the new rule, White House spokesman Judd Deere said in an email, \u201cThe President will continue to take action to facilitate the great American comeback and to improve the quality of life [for] all Americans.\u201dIn the past few months alone, challenges involving the law have halted at least three multibillion-dollar projects championed by the administration and its allies in the energy industry: the Keystone XL pipeline, the Dakota Access pipeline and the Atlantic Coast pipeline. In late June, a federal judge ordered the U.S. Forest Service to redo its environmental impact assessment for a plan to log old-growth trees across 1.8 million acres of Alaska\u2019s Tongass National Forest, after finding the initial proposal violated the law\u2019s basic requirements.Back in January, the White House proposed major changes to NEPA to limit which projects it applied to, how the government would calculate a proposal\u2019s environmental impacts and how long the public would have to weigh in on any given decision.ADADThese changes include eliminating the requirement to examine a project\u2019s cumulative impact, including taking into account other projects in the area; requiring the most complex analyses be completed within two years; and prohibiting agencies from calculating the climate impact of burning fossil fuels extracted from federal lands or waters once they reach their final destination.\u201cIt\u2019s just massive,\u201d said Raul Garcia, legislative director for healthy communities in the policy and legislative department of Earthjustice, an environmental law group, referring to the administration's NEPA overhaul.\u00a0He argued the administration is rewriting the law \u201cwith the overall goal of excluding the public, undermining the study of the impacts that our federal infrastructure has on our communities and cutting a blank check for companies to do whatever they want when it comes to affecting public health and safety.\u201dA coalition of groups \u2014 energy, farming, logging, ranching and chemical manufacturers \u2014 seeks to scale back NEPA.\u00a0Marty Durbin, president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce\u2019s Global Energy Institute, said in a phone interview Saturday the administration\u2019s overhaul will \u201cprovide predictability and transparency\u201d so developers can learn whether a project is viable. The lengthy analysis required under the law, coupled with the legal challenges that almost inevitably follow, can delay proposals for several years.ADAD\u201cThe question is, can we have a process in place here that, in a reasonable time frame, can get us to a yes or a no,\u201d he said. \u201cWe totally support environmental reviews of whatever\u2019s necessary, and community input.\u201dFor decades, developers have deliberately built polluting operations \u2014 including trash incinerators, coal stacks and chemical plants \u2014 near low-income communities and communities of color. A study published last year in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences found African Americans bear a \u201cpollution burden\u201d that is 56 percent higher than other Americans, on average, relative to what they spend on goods and services. Hispanics have a pollution burden that is 63 percent higher, the researchers found.Durbin argued that going forward, industries can rectify these wrongs by building mass transit and renewable energy projects under a streamlined law.ADAD\u201cWe should look at this as an opportunity to provide more economic growth to those areas and have more environmentally sustainable projects in those communities,\u201d he said. \u201cWe clearly have to recognize things we didn\u2019t do right in past, so how do we build them going forward?\u201dBut the Coalition for Healthy Ports\u2019 Kim Gaddy, a 56-year-old activist living in the South Ward of Newark, said in a phone interview that the long-standing environmental law is a critical tool in fending off development contributing to the city\u2019s higher rates of cancer and lung disease.Gaddy has three children with asthma, ages 31, 20 and 16. The area is already home to long-haul diesel trucks shipping goods from the New York-New Jersey Port, Newark Liberty International Airport, the largest incinerator in the Northeast, a natural-gas power plant and another gas plant being proposed by NJ Transit.\u00a0ADADResidents in Newark\u2019s East Ward, known as the Ironbound, convinced policymakers to reroute some heavy trucks off local streets by using NEPA. Gaddy said she fears the NEPA changes will weaken residents\u2019 ability to push back on additional development.\u201cOur main issue is we already suffer from the cumulative impacts of pollution that has disproportionately impacted people of color. So one of the reasons we are fighting for NEPA is that NEPA at least allows us to have a voice,\u201d she said, adding the White House shouldn\u2019t be changing the law \u201cin this day and age of police brutality, of covid-19, when more of us are impacted because we have compromised health systems.\u201d\u00a0\u201cSo now you\u2019re silencing us totally,\u201d Gaddy said. \u201cYou\u2019re forcing us to accept more pollution.\u201dWhile you were sleepingThe Washington Redskins will change their name.\u00a0\u201cThe Washington Redskins plan to announce Monday morning that they will change their team name, three people with knowledge of the situation confirmed Sunday night. The team is not expected to reveal a new name until a later date,\u201d Les Carpenter and Mark Maske report. \u201cTwo people with knowledge of the team\u2019s plans said Sunday that the preferred replacement name is tied up in a trademark fight, which is why the team can\u2019t announce the new name Monday. \u2026 The decision to change the nearly 87-year-old team name comes amid mounting pressure on the franchise from corporate sponsors and the broader nationwide discussion of race.\u201d\u00a0China imposes sanctions on GOP Sens. Marco Rubio (Fla.) and Ted Cruz (Texas).They are for \u201cinterfering in China's internal affairs,\u201d The Post reports. \u201cNo details were disclosed on what the sanctions would involve, but the move comes days after the Trump administration banned three Chinese officials from visiting the United States and froze any U.S. assets they might have.\u201d The sanctions also extend to former Kansas governor Sam Brownback (R), Trump's ambassador for international religious freedom, and Rep. Christopher H. Smith (R-N.J.).The coronavirusLong delays in getting test results are hobbling the coronavirus response.\u00a0\u201cTest results for the novel coronavirus are taking so long to come back that experts say the results across the United States are often proving useless in the campaign to control the deadly disease,\u201d Rachel Weiner, William Wan and Abigail Hauslohner report. \u201cSome testing sites are struggling to provide results in five to seven days. Others are taking even longer. Outbreaks across the Sun Belt have strained labs beyond capacity. That rising demand, in turn, has caused shortages of swabs, chemical reagents and equipment as far away as New York. The long testing turnaround times are making it impossible for the United States to replicate the central strategy used by other countries to effectively contain the virus \u2014 test, trace and isolate. \u2026\u00a0ADAD\u201cAfter attending a funeral, Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms (D) and her family got tested June 29 as a precaution. No one in her family had developed symptoms. A week later, her test results still hadn\u2019t come back, but her husband started feeling ill. So they got a different, rapid test through Emory University. Within hours, Bottoms learned that she, her husband and one of the couple\u2019s four children had all become infected. It wasn\u2019t until the next day that their initial test results finally arrived. They showed that when the family first got tested, only one of them, the child, had the virus. While they waited for their test results, the boy possibly passed it to his parents. \u2026\u201cMore efficient testing \u2014 such as in South Korea, where results are often given the next day \u2014 might have prevented the Bottomses from getting the virus. But such turnarounds seem out of reach in the United States because of a lack of federal coordination, supply shortages and surging demand as outbreaks in some states spiral out of control.\"The U.S. has recorded 3.29 million cases and more than 132,000 deaths. Two Trump health officials warned that more will die.\u201cAdm. Brett Giroir, an assistant secretary with the Health and Human Services department, and Dr. Jerome Adams, the surgeon general, both emphasized their concern about surging outbreaks, many of them in areas where people have not followed recommended public health guidelines to contain the spread of the virus,\u201d the Times reports. \u201c\u2018We\u2019re all very concerned about the rise in cases, no doubt about that,\u2019 [Giroir] said.\u2019 \u2018We do expect deaths to go up,\u2019 \u2026\u2018If you have more cases, more hospitalizations, we do expect to see that over the next two or three weeks before this turns around.\u2019 Still, [Giroir] and Dr. Adams offered up a few optimistic notes. Admiral Giroir said the percentage of positive test results was leveling off, and both officials said that doctors had better tools to treat people who become sick than they did at the start of the pandemic. \u2026\u00a0ADAD\u201cBoth health officials were questioned about the administration\u2019s reluctance to consider returning to a lockdown in some cities and states. Asked on \u2018This Week\u2019 if states with stark increases in cases, like Florida, South Carolina, Arizona, Texas and Georgia, should consider more stringent measures, [Giroir] said \u2018everything should be on the table.\u2019 He said closing bars and limiting the number of patrons allowed in restaurants were \u2018two measures that really do need to be done.\u2019 \u2026 Dr. Adams struck a similar tone \u2026 Appearing on \u2018Face the Nation,\u2019 Dr. Scott Gottlieb, a former commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration in the Trump administration, said, \u2018I think things are going to get worse before they get better.\u2019\u201dFlorida reported more than 15,000 positive cases \u2013 the highest single-day number for any state.\u00a0\u201cFlorida health officials on Sunday reported 15,300 new confirmed cases of COVID-19 \u2014 more than any other state in America has previously reported in a single day. The number in the Florida Department of Health\u2019s latest update blew past the previous high, 12,274 by New York on April 4, and past Florida\u2019s previous high of 11,458 on July 4,\u201d the Miami Herald reports. \u201cWhile the figure reflects Florida\u2019s ballooning case numbers in recent weeks, it may also be the result of a dramatic one-day rise in the number of reported test results. \u2026 But a Herald analysis this past week found disturbing two-week trends \u2014 of increasing positivity and rising numbers of confirmed cases, even as testing volume remained the same. Florida has now had 269,811 confirmed case \u2026 [Republican Gov. Ron] DeSantis has recommended the wearing of face masks, but he has resisted calls to mandate it \u2026 Miami-Dade County Mayor Carlos Gimenez told CNN on Sunday that the county\u2019s hospitals will soon reach capacity, but he said more beds can be added, including for intensive care. \u2026\u00a0ADAD\u201cHealth experts are concerned that people are gathering in crowds, and have expressed concern that the Republican National Convention\u2019s nomination party for Trump is scheduled to be held in Jacksonville in August. A commissioner for a county near Jacksonville is seriously ill with the virus, according to a posting by his daughter on Facebook. \u2026 On Saturday, the Magic Kingdom and Animal Kingdom reopened at Walt Disney World in Orlando, concerning health experts who urge people not to gather in groups. Guests at the park said that people were wearing masks and social distancing, and videos showed near-empty parks.\u201dThe White House is trying to discredit Tony Fauci.\u201cFauci no longer briefs Trump and is \u2018never in the Oval [Office] anymore,\u2019 said a senior administration official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. Fauci last spoke to the president during the first week of June, according to a person with knowledge of Trump\u2019s calendar,\" write Yasmeen Abutaleb, Josh Dawsey and Laurie McGinley.\u00a0\"A White House official released a statement saying that \u201cseveral White House officials are concerned about the number of times Dr. Fauci has been wrong on things\u201d and included a lengthy list of the scientist\u2019s comments from early in the outbreak. Those included his early doubt that people with no symptoms could play a significant role in spreading the virus \u2014 a notion based on earlier outbreaks that the novel coronavirus would turn on its head. They also point to public reassurances Fauci made in late February, around the time of the first U.S. case of community transmission, that \u201cat this moment, there is no need to change anything that you\u2019re doing on a day-by-day basis.\u201dBetsy DeVos made it clear she wants schools to fully reopen for most students.\u00a0\u201cDeVos made her latest statement about what schools should do on CNN\u2019s \u2018State of the Union.\u2019 In the interview with journalist Dana Bash, DeVos doubled down on calls she made last week for schools to reopen. \u2018Kids need to be in school,\u2019 she said. \u2018They need to be learning, they need to be moving ahead. And we can\u2019t \u2014 we cannot be paralyzed and not allow that or not be intent on that happening,\u2019\u201d Valerie Strauss reports. \u201cDeVos said nothing, however, about what school superintendents have been saying they need to reopen: billions of dollars in additional federal funding to cover the costs of changes they have to make and personal protective equipment they need to buy.\u201dFairfax County, Va., schools superintendent Scott Brabrand \u2013 one of the largest U.S. public school systems \u2013 said DeVos \u201ccan\u2019t put every kid back in a school.\u201d\u00a0DeVos has called out Fairfax County\u2019s plan to have students attend in-person schooling twice weekly while spending the other days in remote learning. Brabrand hit back, saying that \u201cthe guidelines for 6 feet social distancing simply mean that you can't put every kid back in a school with the existing square footage footprint. It's just that simple.\u201d (CNN)\u201cI wouldn\u2019t trust you to care for a house plant let alone my child,\" said Rep. Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.) in response to DeVos's push to fully reopen schools. Pressley was among several Democratic lawmakers, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (Calif.), Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (N.Y.) and Sen. Kamala D. Harris (Calif.), who publicly blasted DeVos following her Sunday claims. Pelosi accused Trump and his administration of \u201cmessing with the health of our children,\u201d noting, \u201cGoing back to school presents the biggest risk for the spread of the coronavirus.\u201d (Allyson Chiu)\u00a0A ray of hope: New York City reported zero coronavirus deaths for the first time since March.\u00a0\u201cAccording to initial data reported by the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, no one died from the virus in New York City on July 11. Officials recorded no confirmed deaths the day before as well, but did have two probable death. The department's data shows there hasn't been a day without a coronavirus-related death since March 13, two days after the first reported death,\u201d NBC New York reports. \u00a0California\u2019s failure on early mass testing led to the current surge.\u00a0\u201cCalifornia found itself unprepared, overwhelmed and constantly lagging,\u201d the Los Angeles Times found. \u201cThose early failures left California far behind in the fight against the coronavirus, and it has struggled to keep up \u2014 even as cases surge today. In the beginning, dozens of investigators, called \u2018cluster busters,\u2019 worked each case to try to contain the spread of the coronavirus. They aimed at identifying each strand of transmission and snipping it before the virus could take hold as a sturdy web across communities. They functioned as all-inclusive personal assistants: arranging child care, setting up WiFi, coordinating grocery drop-offs. But data would later show that, long before the official case count began to climb, the virus was freewheeling. Federal officials grappling with a shortage of test kits issued narrow testing criteria; that meant key local spreaders in the state\u2019s budding outbreak were going unnoticed and untraced.\u201d\u00a0Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner and Harris County Judge Lina Hidalgo, both Democrats, are calling for Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) to impose a statewide stay-at-home order amid surging case numbers. Regional cases rose to 63,864 on Sunday. At least 258,658 cases have been reported in the state, per our tracker. Abbott said he might consider shutting down more nonessential businesses if things worsen. (Houston Chronicle)Three Arizona teachers who shared a summer classroom contracted the virus, leaving one of them dead. Kimberley Chavez Lopez Byrd, 61, died last month, less than two weeks after she was hospitalized. All three teachers wore masks and gloves, according to school officials. The state topped 122,000 cases this weekend. (CNN)Several people who attended a huge sandbar party in Michigan for the Fourth of July have tested positive for the virus, officials said. The event was so crowded that health authorities said it\u2019s impossible to track all the people the infected attendees came into contact with. Footage from the event shows thousands partying hip-to-hip in the water. (M Live)Disagreements between the Fed and Treasury slowed down the start of the Main Street Lending Program.\u00a0\u201cThe differences centered on how to craft the loan terms of [the $600 billion program] to help support businesses through the early stages of the pandemic,\u201d the WSJ reports. \u201cFed officials generally favored easier terms that would increase the risk of the government losing money, while Treasury officials preferred a more conservative approach, people familiar with the process said. Treasury, which has put up $75 billion to cover losses, resisted recent changes to relax loan terms. \u2026 The upshot is that the program, announced in March, went through multiple revisions and opened for business this past week. As of Wednesday, it hadn\u2019t purchased any loans. Some Fed officials privately have voiced frustration that painstaking negotiations wasted precious weeks in launching the program.\u201dThe Trump presidencySen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said Bob Mueller may be called to testify after publishing an op-ed on Roger Stone.Graham, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, \u201cdidn\u2019t give any details on the timing of any potential invitation,\u201d Felicia Sonmez reports. \u201cGraham\u2019s statement came one day after Mueller defended his office\u2019s prosecution of Stone, Trump\u2019s longtime friend and political adviser, in a Post op-ed. Trump commuted Stone\u2019s 40-month prison sentence on Friday \u2026 In his statement Sunday, Graham suggested that he had reconsidered his position on allowing Mueller to testify in light of the former special counsel\u2019s op-ed. \u2018Apparently Mr. Mueller is willing \u2014 and also capable \u2014 of defending the Mueller investigation through an oped in the Washington Post,\u2019 Graham said. \u2018Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee have previously requested Mr. Mueller appear before the Senate Judiciary Committee to testify about his investigation. That request will be granted.\u2019 \u2026 A Graham spokeswoman, said a formal invitation to Mueller is in the works but did not provide details on the timing of any potential testimony. There are only about three dozen legislative days remaining for the Senate before the November election. \u2026\u201cTrump\u2019s commutation of Stone\u2019s sentence has triggered a flood of criticism, with Democrats \u2014 and a handful of Republicans \u2014 in recent days arguing that the move amounted to an abuse of presidential power and an effort to undermine the justice system. On Sunday, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) said that \u2018anyone who cares about the rule of law in this country\u2019 should be \u2018nauseated\u2019 by Trump\u2019s actions in the Stone case. \u2026 Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan (R) also criticized Trump\u2019s commutation of Stone\u2019s sentence, calling it a \u2018problem.\u2019 \u2018The president does have the right, by law, to take the action he took,\u2019 Hogan said on NBC News\u2019s \u2018Meet the Press.\u2019 \u2018That doesn\u2019t mean he should have.\u2019 \u2026 Trump fired back at two of the Republicans who have criticized him \u2014 Sens. Mitt Romney (Utah) and Patrick J. Toomey (Pa.) \u2014 in a tweet on Saturday night in which he called them \u2018RINO\u2019S.\u2019\u201dStone plans on campaigning for Trump now that he \u201cwon\u2019t die in a squalid hellhole of corona-19 virus.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m asthmatic,\u201d he told Axios. \u201cSending me to a prison where I could not be socially distanced ... would, I think, be a death sentence.\u201d He said he\u2019ll do \u201canything necessary to elect my candidate, short of breaking the law.\u201dTrump has made more than 20,000 false or misleading claims.\u201cIt took Trump 827 days to top 10,000 false and misleading claims in The Fact Checker\u2019s database, an average of 12 claims a day. But on July 9, just 440 days later, the president crossed the 20,000 mark \u2014 an average of 23 claims a day over a 14-month period,\u201d Glenn Kessler, Salvador Rizzo and Meg Kelly report. \u201cThe coronavirus pandemic has spawned a whole new genre of Trump\u2019s falsehoods. The category in just a few months has reached nearly 1,000 claims, more than his tax claims combined.\u201dMark Meadows has been feeding nuggets of information to suspected leakers to see if they pass them on.\u00a0So far, Meadows, Trump\u2019s chief of staff, has yet to discover any leakers, Axios reports. \u201cA source familiar with Meadows' thinking said he is \u2018focused on national security leaks and could care less about the palace intrigue stories.\u2019 On a recent podcast with Ted Cruz, however, Meadows said they tracked down and fired a federal employee who leaked information about a White House social media executive order.\u201d\u00a0Trump lashed out against supporters who built a portion of the border wall in his honor.\u201cTrump on Sunday criticized a privately built border wall in South Texas that\u2019s showing signs of erosion months after going up, saying it was \u2018only done to make me look bad,\u2019 even though the wall was built after a months-long campaign by his supporters,\u201d the AP reports. \u201cThe group that raised money online for the wall promoted itself as supporting Trump during a government shutdown that started in December 2018 because Congress wouldn\u2019t fund Trump\u2019s demands for a border wall. Called \u2018We Build the Wall,\u2019 the group has raised more than $25 million promoting itself as supporting the president. Former Trump chief strategist Steve Bannon joined the group\u2019s board and Trump ally Kris Kobach became its general counsel. \u2026 The section in question is a roughly 3-mile (5-kilometer) fence of steel posts just 35 feet (10 meters) from the Rio Grande, the river that forms the U.S.-Mexico border in Texas. That\u2019s much closer to the river than the government ordinarily builds border barriers in South Texas because of concerns about erosion and flooding that could violate U.S. treaty obligations with Mexico.\u201d\u00a0The electionTrump campaign manager Brad Parscale is hitting a rough patch.\u201cAs Trump\u2019s reelection effort struggles, Parscale, despite his self-promotion, increasingly finds himself out of favor with his boss and hemmed in by newly hired staffers and recently promoted advisers, according to people familiar with the campaign,\u201d Michael Scherer and Josh Dawsey report. \u201cTrump has made clear his displeasure with Parscale, especially after a disappointing rally in Tulsa, and the campaign has expanded its senior team in ways that diminish his role, according to multiple campaign and administration officials. Trump\u2019s new kitchen cabinet, a combination of White House and campaign employees led by White House senior adviser Jared Kushner, includes Parscale\u2019s recently promoted deputy Bill Stepien and two communications aides from the 2016 campaign \u2014 Hope Hicks and Jason Miller, who was recently hired by the campaign and is increasingly seen as its principal strategist. \u2026 [C]ampaign and White House officials say Parscale does not always appear to understand the political dynamics of crucial swing states. \u2026 A senior Trump administration official \u2026 said Parscale \u2018knows he screwed up\u2019 with the Trump rally\u2026\u00a0\u201c[Parscale is also absent] from campaign headquarters. Parscale lives in Florida, and the campaign is based in Northern Virginia, and staffers say that when they talk to him, he is often by his pool in Fort Lauderdale. \u2026 The amount of money that Parscale has personally earned from the campaign is undisclosed in Federal Election Commission reports, because the reports do not distinguish between the money that goes directly to him and the payments that go to his firm, Parscale Strategies, for pass-through costs. \u2026 Between September 2019 and May 2020, [Trump and GOP] accounts paid Parscale Strategies an average of $100,905 a month. \u2026 In comparison, records show that Biden\u2019s campaign manager, Jen O\u2019Malley Dillon, has been paid $11,486 a month since taking over in April.\u201d\u00a0The pandemic has reshaped the presidential race in the Sun Belt.\u00a0\u201cBiden is now leading Trump by six points in Florida, and the two are tied in Arizona and competitive in Texas, where Biden is down by just a point to Mr. Trump. Biden has made gains in part because most say their state's efforts to contain the virus are going badly \u2014 and the more concerned voters are about risks from the outbreak, the more likely they are to support Biden,\u201d a CBS News poll found. \u201cIn all three states, most voters say their state reopened too soon, and those who say this feel their state went too fast under pressure from the Trump administration. Most also say the president is doing a bad job handling the outbreak. He may be paying a price for that, at least in the short term.\u201d\u00a0Biden has a five-point lead over Trump in Texas, per a Dallas Morning News-University of Texas at Tyler poll.\u00a0The Biden campaign, though, has done little to demonstrate it will make a major push in the Lone Star State. Texas hasn\u2019t voted for a Democratic presidential candidate since Jimmy Carter in 1976.Trump\u2019s battle against Michigan\u2019s female leaders could have 2020 implications.\u00a0\u201cBeyond being the women leading Michigan\u2019s state government, Gretchen Whitmer, Dana Nessel and Jocelyn Benson have a lot in common,\u201d the Times reports. \u201cBy 2018, the three were swept into statewide office on a wave that flipped much of Michigan\u2019s leadership from red to blue and put three women \u2014 Ms. Whitmer, the governor; Ms. Nessel, the attorney general; and Ms. Benson, the secretary of state \u2014 in charge of running the state for the first time. Now these women share another distinction: They\u2019re all targets of Trump. Trailing in polls to Biden in this key battleground state, the president has taken aggressive aim at [them] zeroing in on their mission to expand voting rights in a state where his 2016 winning margin of just 10,704 votes was the narrowest in the country. The three women have in turn responded forcefully to Mr. Trump \u2026 Michigan Democrats believe that the state leaders are a not-so-secret weapon in the 2020 election. They see the president\u2019s frequent barbs \u2026 as helping fuel the anti-Trump bandwagon in the state, which before 2016 had not voted for a Republican presidential candidate since 1988.\u201dQuote of the day\u201cThere\u2019s a tsunami coming,\u201d in November, said former Virginia governor Terry McAuliffe (D) about the Democrats' chances in the general election. \u201cIf [Trump had] early on jumped in front of the coronavirus and been a leader, this guy would\u2019ve been unbeatable. But every opportunity he\u2019s had to stand up and be a leader, whether Charlottesville or anything else, he\u2019s failed each time.\u201d (Philip Rucker, Rachael Bade and Seung Min Kim)\u00a0Social media speed readThe Houston Chronicle's Sunday edition had a stand-alone obituary section:\u00a0Many jumped to Tony Fauci's defense after it was reported that the White House is leading a campaign against him:\u00a0Back in 1998, President George H.W.

Subscribe today.arrow-rightAt a moment when many communities of color are calling for greater input in public policy, President Trump is seeking to overhaul one of the nation's most powerful environmental laws in a way that could minimize their voices.On Wednesday, the president is slated to finalize changes to the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), which requires the federal government to analyze how a major decision affects the environment and take public comment. Trump will travel to Atlanta to make the case that scaling back the 50 year-old statute will speed the construction of highways, pipelines and other infrastructure projects across the country. His cheerleading for a robust economic rebound comes in the midst of the novel coronavirus pandemic that continues to set new infection records.NEPA has emerged as a major legal counterweight to the Trump administration\u2019s policy agenda.\u00a0And it's one of the most effective ways Americans of color have pushed back against plans that could harm their health and environment. Business groups and some unions, however, argue that it is a burdensome and complex law that has exponentially increased the cost and time it takes to modernize America\u2019s infrastructure.ADADAsked about the new rule, White House spokesman Judd Deere said in an email, \u201cThe President will continue to take action to facilitate the great American comeback and to improve the quality of life [for] all Americans.\u201dIn the past few months alone, challenges involving the law have halted at least three multibillion-dollar projects championed by the administration and its allies in the energy industry: the Keystone XL pipeline, the Dakota Access pipeline and the Atlantic Coast pipeline. In late June, a federal judge ordered the U.S. Forest Service to redo its environmental impact assessment for a plan to log old-growth trees across 1.8 million acres of Alaska\u2019s Tongass National Forest, after finding the initial proposal violated the law\u2019s basic requirements.Back in January, the White House proposed major changes to NEPA to limit which projects it applied to, how the government would calculate a proposal\u2019s environmental impacts and how long the public would have to weigh in on any given decision.ADADThese changes include eliminating the requirement to examine a project\u2019s cumulative impact, including taking into account other projects in the area; requiring the most complex analyses be completed within two years; and prohibiting agencies from calculating the climate impact of burning fossil fuels extracted from federal lands or waters once they reach their final destination.\u201cIt\u2019s just massive,\u201d said Raul Garcia, legislative director for healthy communities in the policy and legislative department of Earthjustice, an environmental law group, referring to the administration's NEPA overhaul.\u00a0He argued the administration is rewriting the law \u201cwith the overall goal of excluding the public, undermining the study of the impacts that our federal infrastructure has on our communities and cutting a blank check for companies to do whatever they want when it comes to affecting public health and safety.\u201dA coalition of groups \u2014 energy, farming, logging, ranching and chemical manufacturers \u2014 seeks to scale back NEPA.\u00a0Marty Durbin, president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce\u2019s Global Energy Institute, said in a phone interview Saturday the administration\u2019s overhaul will \u201cprovide predictability and transparency\u201d so developers can learn whether a project is viable. The lengthy analysis required under the law, coupled with the legal challenges that almost inevitably follow, can delay proposals for several years.ADAD\u201cThe question is, can we have a process in place here that, in a reasonable time frame, can get us to a yes or a no,\u201d he said. \u201cWe totally support environmental reviews of whatever\u2019s necessary, and community input.\u201dFor decades, developers have deliberately built polluting operations \u2014 including trash incinerators, coal stacks and chemical plants \u2014 near low-income communities and communities of color. A study published last year in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences found African Americans bear a \u201cpollution burden\u201d that is 56 percent higher than other Americans, on average, relative to what they spend on goods and services. Hispanics have a pollution burden that is 63 percent higher, the researchers found.Durbin argued that going forward, industries can rectify these wrongs by building mass transit and renewable energy projects under a streamlined law.ADAD\u201cWe should look at this as an opportunity to provide more economic growth to those areas and have more environmentally sustainable projects in those communities,\u201d he said. \u201cWe clearly have to recognize things we didn\u2019t do right in past, so how do we build them going forward?\u201dBut the Coalition for Healthy Ports\u2019 Kim Gaddy, a 56-year-old activist living in the South Ward of Newark, said in a phone interview that the long-standing environmental law is a critical tool in fending off development contributing to the city\u2019s higher rates of cancer and lung disease.Gaddy has three children with asthma, ages 31, 20 and 16. The area is already home to long-haul diesel trucks shipping goods from the New York-New Jersey Port, Newark Liberty International Airport, the largest incinerator in the Northeast, a natural-gas power plant and another gas plant being proposed by NJ Transit.\u00a0ADADResidents in Newark\u2019s East Ward, known as the Ironbound, convinced policymakers to reroute some heavy trucks off local streets by using NEPA. Gaddy said she fears the NEPA changes will weaken residents\u2019 ability to push back on additional development.\u201cOur main issue is we already suffer from the cumulative impacts of pollution that has disproportionately impacted people of color. So one of the reasons we are fighting for NEPA is that NEPA at least allows us to have a voice,\u201d she said, adding the White House shouldn\u2019t be changing the law \u201cin this day and age of police brutality, of covid-19, when more of us are impacted because we have compromised health systems.\u201d\u00a0\u201cSo now you\u2019re silencing us totally,\u201d Gaddy said. \u201cYou\u2019re forcing us to accept more pollution.\u201dWhile you were sleepingThe Washington Redskins will change their name.\u00a0\u201cThe Washington Redskins plan to announce Monday morning that they will change their team name, three people with knowledge of the situation confirmed Sunday night. The team is not expected to reveal a new name until a later date,\u201d Les Carpenter and Mark Maske report. \u201cTwo people with knowledge of the team\u2019s plans said Sunday that the preferred replacement name is tied up in a trademark fight, which is why the team can\u2019t announce the new name Monday. \u2026 The decision to change the nearly 87-year-old team name comes amid mounting pressure on the franchise from corporate sponsors and the broader nationwide discussion of race.\u201d\u00a0China imposes sanctions on GOP Sens. Marco Rubio (Fla.) and Ted Cruz (Texas).They are for \u201cinterfering in China's internal affairs,\u201d The Post reports. \u201cNo details were disclosed on what the sanctions would involve, but the move comes days after the Trump administration banned three Chinese officials from visiting the United States and froze any U.S. assets they might have.\u201d The sanctions also extend to former Kansas governor Sam Brownback (R), Trump's ambassador for international religious freedom, and Rep. Christopher H. Smith (R-N.J.).The coronavirusLong delays in getting test results are hobbling the coronavirus response.\u00a0\u201cTest results for the novel coronavirus are taking so long to come back that experts say the results across the United States are often proving useless in the campaign to control the deadly disease,\u201d Rachel Weiner, William Wan and Abigail Hauslohner report. \u201cSome testing sites are struggling to provide results in five to seven days. Others are taking even longer. Outbreaks across the Sun Belt have strained labs beyond capacity. That rising demand, in turn, has caused shortages of swabs, chemical reagents and equipment as far away as New York. The long testing turnaround times are making it impossible for the United States to replicate the central strategy used by other countries to effectively contain the virus \u2014 test, trace and isolate. \u2026\u00a0ADAD\u201cAfter attending a funeral, Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms (D) and her family got tested June 29 as a precaution. No one in her family had developed symptoms. A week later, her test results still hadn\u2019t come back, but her husband started feeling ill. So they got a different, rapid test through Emory University. Within hours, Bottoms learned that she, her husband and one of the couple\u2019s four children had all become infected. It wasn\u2019t until the next day that their initial test results finally arrived. They showed that when the family first got tested, only one of them, the child, had the virus. While they waited for their test results, the boy possibly passed it to his parents. \u2026\u201cMore efficient testing \u2014 such as in South Korea, where results are often given the next day \u2014 might have prevented the Bottomses from getting the virus. But such turnarounds seem out of reach in the United States because of a lack of federal coordination, supply shortages and surging demand as outbreaks in some states spiral out of control.\"The U.S. has recorded 3.29 million cases and more than 132,000 deaths. Two Trump health officials warned that more will die.\u201cAdm. Brett Giroir, an assistant secretary with the Health and Human Services department, and Dr. Jerome Adams, the surgeon general, both emphasized their concern about surging outbreaks, many of them in areas where people have not followed recommended public health guidelines to contain the spread of the virus,\u201d the Times reports. \u201c\u2018We\u2019re all very concerned about the rise in cases, no doubt about that,\u2019 [Giroir] said.\u2019 \u2018We do expect deaths to go up,\u2019 \u2026\u2018If you have more cases, more hospitalizations, we do expect to see that over the next two or three weeks before this turns around.\u2019 Still, [Giroir] and Dr. Adams offered up a few optimistic notes. Admiral Giroir said the percentage of positive test results was leveling off, and both officials said that doctors had better tools to treat people who become sick than they did at the start of the pandemic. \u2026\u00a0ADAD\u201cBoth health officials were questioned about the administration\u2019s reluctance to consider returning to a lockdown in some cities and states. Asked on \u2018This Week\u2019 if states with stark increases in cases, like Florida, South Carolina, Arizona, Texas and Georgia, should consider more stringent measures, [Giroir] said \u2018everything should be on the table.\u2019 He said closing bars and limiting the number of patrons allowed in restaurants were \u2018two measures that really do need to be done.\u2019 \u2026 Dr. Adams struck a similar tone \u2026 Appearing on \u2018Face the Nation,\u2019 Dr. Scott Gottlieb, a former commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration in the Trump administration, said, \u2018I think things are going to get worse before they get better.\u2019\u201dFlorida reported more than 15,000 positive cases \u2013 the highest single-day number for any state.\u00a0\u201cFlorida health officials on Sunday reported 15,300 new confirmed cases of COVID-19 \u2014 more than any other state in America has previously reported in a single day. The number in the Florida Department of Health\u2019s latest update blew past the previous high, 12,274 by New York on April 4, and past Florida\u2019s previous high of 11,458 on July 4,\u201d the Miami Herald reports. \u201cWhile the figure reflects Florida\u2019s ballooning case numbers in recent weeks, it may also be the result of a dramatic one-day rise in the number of reported test results. \u2026 But a Herald analysis this past week found disturbing two-week trends \u2014 of increasing positivity and rising numbers of confirmed cases, even as testing volume remained the same. Florida has now had 269,811 confirmed case \u2026 [Republican Gov. Ron] DeSantis has recommended the wearing of face masks, but he has resisted calls to mandate it \u2026 Miami-Dade County Mayor Carlos Gimenez told CNN on Sunday that the county\u2019s hospitals will soon reach capacity, but he said more beds can be added, including for intensive care. \u2026\u00a0ADAD\u201cHealth experts are concerned that people are gathering in crowds, and have expressed concern that the Republican National Convention\u2019s nomination party for Trump is scheduled to be held in Jacksonville in August. A commissioner for a county near Jacksonville is seriously ill with the virus, according to a posting by his daughter on Facebook. \u2026 On Saturday, the Magic Kingdom and Animal Kingdom reopened at Walt Disney World in Orlando, concerning health experts who urge people not to gather in groups. Guests at the park said that people were wearing masks and social distancing, and videos showed near-empty parks.\u201dThe White House is trying to discredit Tony Fauci.\u201cFauci no longer briefs Trump and is \u2018never in the Oval [Office] anymore,\u2019 said a senior administration official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. Fauci last spoke to the president during the first week of June, according to a person with knowledge of Trump\u2019s calendar,\" write Yasmeen Abutaleb, Josh Dawsey and Laurie McGinley.\u00a0\"A White House official released a statement saying that \u201cseveral White House officials are concerned about the number of times Dr. Fauci has been wrong on things\u201d and included a lengthy list of the scientist\u2019s comments from early in the outbreak. Those included his early doubt that people with no symptoms could play a significant role in spreading the virus \u2014 a notion based on earlier outbreaks that the novel coronavirus would turn on its head. They also point to public reassurances Fauci made in late February, around the time of the first U.S. case of community transmission, that \u201cat this moment, there is no need to change anything that you\u2019re doing on a day-by-day basis.\u201dBetsy DeVos made it clear she wants schools to fully reopen for most students.\u00a0\u201cDeVos made her latest statement about what schools should do on CNN\u2019s \u2018State of the Union.\u2019 In the interview with journalist Dana Bash, DeVos doubled down on calls she made last week for schools to reopen. \u2018Kids need to be in school,\u2019 she said. \u2018They need to be learning, they need to be moving ahead. And we can\u2019t \u2014 we cannot be paralyzed and not allow that or not be intent on that happening,\u2019\u201d Valerie Strauss reports. \u201cDeVos said nothing, however, about what school superintendents have been saying they need to reopen: billions of dollars in additional federal funding to cover the costs of changes they have to make and personal protective equipment they need to buy.\u201dFairfax County, Va., schools superintendent Scott Brabrand \u2013 one of the largest U.S. public school systems \u2013 said DeVos \u201ccan\u2019t put every kid back in a school.\u201d\u00a0DeVos has called out Fairfax County\u2019s plan to have students attend in-person schooling twice weekly while spending the other days in remote learning. Brabrand hit back, saying that \u201cthe guidelines for 6 feet social distancing simply mean that you can't put every kid back in a school with the existing square footage footprint. It's just that simple.\u201d (CNN)\u201cI wouldn\u2019t trust you to care for a house plant let alone my child,\" said Rep. Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.) in response to DeVos's push to fully reopen schools. Pressley was among several Democratic lawmakers, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (Calif.), Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (N.Y.) and Sen. Kamala D. Harris (Calif.), who publicly blasted DeVos following her Sunday claims. Pelosi accused Trump and his administration of \u201cmessing with the health of our children,\u201d noting, \u201cGoing back to school presents the biggest risk for the spread of the coronavirus.\u201d (Allyson Chiu)\u00a0A ray of hope: New York City reported zero coronavirus deaths for the first time since March.\u00a0\u201cAccording to initial data reported by the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, no one died from the virus in New York City on July 11. Officials recorded no confirmed deaths the day before as well, but did have two probable death. The department's data shows there hasn't been a day without a coronavirus-related death since March 13, two days after the first reported death,\u201d NBC New York reports. \u00a0California\u2019s failure on early mass testing led to the current surge.\u00a0\u201cCalifornia found itself unprepared, overwhelmed and constantly lagging,\u201d the Los Angeles Times found. \u201cThose early failures left California far behind in the fight against the coronavirus, and it has struggled to keep up \u2014 even as cases surge today. In the beginning, dozens of investigators, called \u2018cluster busters,\u2019 worked each case to try to contain the spread of the coronavirus. They aimed at identifying each strand of transmission and snipping it before the virus could take hold as a sturdy web across communities. They functioned as all-inclusive personal assistants: arranging child care, setting up WiFi, coordinating grocery drop-offs. But data would later show that, long before the official case count began to climb, the virus was freewheeling. Federal officials grappling with a shortage of test kits issued narrow testing criteria; that meant key local spreaders in the state\u2019s budding outbreak were going unnoticed and untraced.\u201d\u00a0Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner and Harris County Judge Lina Hidalgo, both Democrats, are calling for Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) to impose a statewide stay-at-home order amid surging case numbers. Regional cases rose to 63,864 on Sunday. At least 258,658 cases have been reported in the state, per our tracker. Abbott said he might consider shutting down more nonessential businesses if things worsen. (Houston Chronicle)Three Arizona teachers who shared a summer classroom contracted the virus, leaving one of them dead. Kimberley Chavez Lopez Byrd, 61, died last month, less than two weeks after she was hospitalized. All three teachers wore masks and gloves, according to school officials. The state topped 122,000 cases this weekend. (CNN)Several people who attended a huge sandbar party in Michigan for the Fourth of July have tested positive for the virus, officials said. The event was so crowded that health authorities said it\u2019s impossible to track all the people the infected attendees came into contact with. Footage from the event shows thousands partying hip-to-hip in the water. (M Live)Disagreements between the Fed and Treasury slowed down the start of the Main Street Lending Program.\u00a0\u201cThe differences centered on how to craft the loan terms of [the $600 billion program] to help support businesses through the early stages of the pandemic,\u201d the WSJ reports. \u201cFed officials generally favored easier terms that would increase the risk of the government losing money, while Treasury officials preferred a more conservative approach, people familiar with the process said. Treasury, which has put up $75 billion to cover losses, resisted recent changes to relax loan terms. \u2026 The upshot is that the program, announced in March, went through multiple revisions and opened for business this past week. As of Wednesday, it hadn\u2019t purchased any loans. Some Fed officials privately have voiced frustration that painstaking negotiations wasted precious weeks in launching the program.\u201dThe Trump presidencySen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said Bob Mueller may be called to testify after publishing an op-ed on Roger Stone.Graham, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, \u201cdidn\u2019t give any details on the timing of any potential invitation,\u201d Felicia Sonmez reports. \u201cGraham\u2019s statement came one day after Mueller defended his office\u2019s prosecution of Stone, Trump\u2019s longtime friend and political adviser, in a Post op-ed. Trump commuted Stone\u2019s 40-month prison sentence on Friday \u2026 In his statement Sunday, Graham suggested that he had reconsidered his position on allowing Mueller to testify in light of the former special counsel\u2019s op-ed. \u2018Apparently Mr. Mueller is willing \u2014 and also capable \u2014 of defending the Mueller investigation through an oped in the Washington Post,\u2019 Graham said. \u2018Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee have previously requested Mr. Mueller appear before the Senate Judiciary Committee to testify about his investigation. That request will be granted.\u2019 \u2026 A Graham spokeswoman, said a formal invitation to Mueller is in the works but did not provide details on the timing of any potential testimony. There are only about three dozen legislative days remaining for the Senate before the November election. \u2026\u201cTrump\u2019s commutation of Stone\u2019s sentence has triggered a flood of criticism, with Democrats \u2014 and a handful of Republicans \u2014 in recent days arguing that the move amounted to an abuse of presidential power and an effort to undermine the justice system. On Sunday, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) said that \u2018anyone who cares about the rule of law in this country\u2019 should be \u2018nauseated\u2019 by Trump\u2019s actions in the Stone case. \u2026 Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan (R) also criticized Trump\u2019s commutation of Stone\u2019s sentence, calling it a \u2018problem.\u2019 \u2018The president does have the right, by law, to take the action he took,\u2019 Hogan said on NBC News\u2019s \u2018Meet the Press.\u2019 \u2018That doesn\u2019t mean he should have.\u2019 \u2026 Trump fired back at two of the Republicans who have criticized him \u2014 Sens. Mitt Romney (Utah) and Patrick J.

But on July 9, just 440 days later, the president crossed the 20,000 mark \u2014 an average of 23 claims a day over a 14-month period,\u201d Glenn Kessler, Salvador Rizzo and Meg Kelly report. \u201cThe coronavirus pandemic has spawned a whole new genre of Trump\u2019s falsehoods. The category in just a few months has reached nearly 1,000 claims, more than his tax claims combined.\u201dMark Meadows has been feeding nuggets of information to suspected leakers to see if they pass them on.\u00a0So far, Meadows, Trump\u2019s chief of staff, has yet to discover any leakers, Axios reports. \u201cA source familiar with Meadows' thinking said he is \u2018focused on national security leaks and could care less about the palace intrigue stories.\u2019 On a recent podcast with Ted Cruz, however, Meadows said they tracked down and fired a federal employee who leaked information about a White House social media executive order.\u201d\u00a0Trump lashed out against supporters who built a portion of the border wall in his honor.\u201cTrump on Sunday criticized a privately built border wall in South Texas that\u2019s showing signs of erosion months after going up, saying it was \u2018only done to make me look bad,\u2019 even though the wall was built after a months-long campaign by his supporters,\u201d the AP reports. \u201cThe group that raised money online for the wall promoted itself as supporting Trump during a government shutdown that started in December 2018 because Congress wouldn\u2019t fund Trump\u2019s demands for a border wall. Called \u2018We Build the Wall,\u2019 the group has raised more than $25 million promoting itself as supporting the president. Former Trump chief strategist Steve Bannon joined the group\u2019s board and Trump ally Kris Kobach became its general counsel. \u2026 The section in question is a roughly 3-mile (5-kilometer) fence of steel posts just 35 feet (10 meters) from the Rio Grande, the river that forms the U.S.-Mexico border in Texas. That\u2019s much closer to the river than the government ordinarily builds border barriers in South Texas because of concerns about erosion and flooding that could violate U.S. treaty obligations with Mexico.\u201d\u00a0The electionTrump campaign manager Brad Parscale is hitting a rough patch.\u201cAs Trump\u2019s reelection effort struggles, Parscale, despite his self-promotion, increasingly finds himself out of favor with his boss and hemmed in by newly hired staffers and recently promoted advisers, according to people familiar with the campaign,\u201d Michael Scherer and Josh Dawsey report. \u201cTrump has made clear his displeasure with Parscale, especially after a disappointing rally in Tulsa, and the campaign has expanded its senior team in ways that diminish his role, according to multiple campaign and administration officials. Trump\u2019s new kitchen cabinet, a combination of White House and campaign employees led by White House senior adviser Jared Kushner, includes Parscale\u2019s recently promoted deputy Bill Stepien and two communications aides from the 2016 campaign \u2014 Hope Hicks and Jason Miller, who was recently hired by the campaign and is increasingly seen as its principal strategist. \u2026 [C]ampaign and White House officials say Parscale does not always appear to understand the political dynamics of crucial swing states. \u2026 A senior Trump administration official \u2026 said Parscale \u2018knows he screwed up\u2019 with the Trump rally\u2026\u00a0\u201c[Parscale is also absent] from campaign headquarters. Parscale lives in Florida, and the campaign is based in Northern Virginia, and staffers say that when they talk to him, he is often by his pool in Fort Lauderdale. \u2026 The amount of money that Parscale has personally earned from the campaign is undisclosed in Federal Election Commission reports, because the reports do not distinguish between the money that goes directly to him and the payments that go to his firm, Parscale Strategies, for pass-through costs. \u2026 Between September 2019 and May 2020, [Trump and GOP] accounts paid Parscale Strategies an average of $100,905 a month. \u2026 In comparison, records show that Biden\u2019s campaign manager, Jen O\u2019Malley Dillon, has been paid $11,486 a month since taking over in April.\u201d\u00a0The pandemic has reshaped the presidential race in the Sun Belt.\u00a0\u201cBiden is now leading Trump by six points in Florida, and the two are tied in Arizona and competitive in Texas, where Biden is down by just a point to Mr. Trump. Biden has made gains in part because most say their state's efforts to contain the virus are going badly \u2014 and the more concerned voters are about risks from the outbreak, the more likely they are to support Biden,\u201d a CBS News poll found. \u201cIn all three states, most voters say their state reopened too soon, and those who say this feel their state went too fast under pressure from the Trump administration. Most also say the president is doing a bad job handling the outbreak. He may be paying a price for that, at least in the short term.\u201d\u00a0Biden has a five-point lead over Trump in Texas, per a Dallas Morning News-University of Texas at Tyler poll.\u00a0The Biden campaign, though, has done little to demonstrate it will make a major push in the Lone Star State. Texas hasn\u2019t voted for a Democratic presidential candidate since Jimmy Carter in 1976.Trump\u2019s battle against Michigan\u2019s female leaders could have 2020 implications.\u00a0\u201cBeyond being the women leading Michigan\u2019s state government, Gretchen Whitmer, Dana Nessel and Jocelyn Benson have a lot in common,\u201d the Times reports. \u201cBy 2018, the three were swept into statewide office on a wave that flipped much of Michigan\u2019s leadership from red to blue and put three women \u2014 Ms. Whitmer, the governor; Ms. Nessel, the attorney general; and Ms. Benson, the secretary of state \u2014 in charge of running the state for the first time. Now these women share another distinction: They\u2019re all targets of Trump. Trailing in polls to Biden in this key battleground state, the president has taken aggressive aim at [them] zeroing in on their mission to expand voting rights in a state where his 2016 winning margin of just 10,704 votes was the narrowest in the country. The three women have in turn responded forcefully to Mr. Trump \u2026 Michigan Democrats believe that the state leaders are a not-so-secret weapon in the 2020 election. They see the president\u2019s frequent barbs \u2026 as helping fuel the anti-Trump bandwagon in the state, which before 2016 had not voted for a Republican presidential candidate since 1988.\u201dQuote of the day\u201cThere\u2019s a tsunami coming,\u201d in November, said former Virginia governor Terry McAuliffe (D) about the Democrats' chances in the general election. \u201cIf [Trump had] early on jumped in front of the coronavirus and been a leader, this guy would\u2019ve been unbeatable. But every opportunity he\u2019s had to stand up and be a leader, whether Charlottesville or anything else, he\u2019s failed each time.\u201d (Philip Rucker, Rachael Bade and Seung Min Kim)\u00a0Social media speed readThe Houston Chronicle's Sunday edition had a stand-alone obituary section:\u00a0Many jumped to Tony Fauci's defense after it was reported that the White House is leading a campaign against him:\u00a0Back in 1998, President George H.W.

So it is reassuring to see the British government begin to impose sanctions on human rights abusers \u2014 and deny them safe harbor.Support our journalism. Subscribe today.arrow-rightThe foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, last week announced the first sanctions under a law similar to the Global Magnitsky Act in the United States, naming 47 individuals who will face travel restrictions and asset freezes, including 25 Russians involved with the death of Sergei Magnitsky in a Russian prison and 20 Saudis involved in the assassination of Post contributing columnist Jamal Khashoggi, among others. Mr. Raab said, \u201cIf you are a kleptocrat or an organized criminal, you will not be able to launder your blood money in this country.\u201dThe U.S. law is named after Magnitsky, a 37-year-old tax law expert who died ill and brutalized in a Moscow prison on Nov. 16, 2009. Magnitsky had exposed Russian officials who fraudulently obtained a $230 million tax refund from their government.ADADThe law intends to hold accountable people complicit in human rights abuses who, in the past, have often frolicked unimpeded in open societies. Britain passed the law two years ago but has now begun imposing sanctions, made possible by its exit from the European Union in January. Two of the Crown dependencies, Jersey and Guernsey \u2014 as well as the Cayman Islands, an overseas territory of the United Kingdom \u2014 have followed suit, potentially closing off important destinations for dirty cash. There are now seven countries with Magnitsky laws: the United States, Canada, Britain, Estonia, Lithuania, Latvia and Kosovo. The European Union has agreed in principle, and Australia is moving toward it.Britain\u2019s determination to play a more aggressive role is to be welcomed. The latest sanctions included one of President Vladimir Putin\u2019s security officials, Alexander Bastrykin, head of the federal Investigative Committee, who is also under U.S. sanction. Do these sanctions bite? Seems like it: Soon after the British announcement, the Kremlin threatened to reciprocate.More attention must focus on China, which is carrying out the cultural and demographic genocide of the Muslim Uighur people in Xinjiang province, the suppression of democracy in Hong Kong and systematic repression in Tibet. For the most part, sanctions have been aimed at people who execute atrocities, but what about the political leaders and overlords who enable them, such as Xinjiang party boss Chen Quanguo? The United States last week imposed sanctions and visa restrictions on Mr. Chen and other Xinjiang officials, and Britain should follow suit. So far, a certain diplomatic caution and realpolitik has spared the likes of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman or Hong Kong\u2019s executive, Carrie Lam, from direct personal sanction.

Observers had long wondered: Would he stay or would he go?Support our journalism. Subscribe today.arrow-rightVoters in Russia answered that question by approving a package of constitutional amendments this week \u2014 including changes that grant Putin the right to run for two more six-year presidential terms. Reports of irregularities were widespread. A European Union spokesperson noted concerns including voter coercion and double voting, along with intimidation of observers.Russia\u2019s referendum could keep Vladimir Putin in power until 2036. What do high-ranking Russians think?Here\u2019s the backstoryIn mid-January, Putin submitted proposals for amendments to the constitution and formed a working group to refine the legislation. On March 10, a Russian Duma deputy proposed an amendment that would reset Putin\u2019s presidential term limit clock to zero \u2014 a move that would allow him to run for office in 2024 and 2030, and potentially remain in office through 2036. Within a week, Russia\u2019s parliament and regional governments ratified the amendments and the Constitutional Court approved the changes. The popular referendum was the next step.ADADA shaky Kremlin takes no chancesWith a stagnant economy, a dysfunctional bureaucracy, a haphazard coronavirus response and declining trust in the president, the Kremlin took no chances on the vote. The Kremlin tacked on a number of popular initiatives, such as raising the minimum wage, indexing pensions and defining marriage as a union only between a man and woman \u2014 hardly a sign of confidence in the popularity of the constitutional reform.Bundling the amendments as a single package rather than having Russians vote on separate issues suggests concern that Russians might not have supported extending the president\u2019s term beyond 2024, if this appeared as a stand-alone ballot question. A recent survey found 51 percent in favor and 44 against this amendment.ADIn the end, the Kremlin achieved its goal. Early reports show that the full packet of amendments passed with 78 percent approval and a 68 percent turnout.ADBut why did Putin seek to extend his rule? Six months ago, many smart analysts thought Putin would step down as president to head a newly empowered State Council and oversee Russia as its \u201cnational leader\u201d \u2014 perhaps following the model of Deng Xiaoping in China.Will Vladimir Putin become Russia\u2019s prime minister after 2024?To explain Putin\u2019s motivations, some observers point to his KGB background or Russia\u2019s tradition of strongman rule. Putin himself has highlighted the need to protect Russia\u2019s political stability, such as it is.But these arguments miss the bigger picture. Since 1991, rulers in consolidated autocracies in the former Soviet Union have frequently sought to extend their rule, regardless of their personal backgrounds, the need for political stability or their country\u2019s historical traditions. Examples include ex-collective farm director Alyaksandr Lukashenko in Belarus in 2004, and Ilham Aliyev \u2014 the son of a dictator \u2014 in Azerbaijan in 2008. Leaders in Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan made similar moves, and did so during periods of stability and instability. Both presidents of Turkmenistan extended their rule beyond their original limit.ADADOf course, Putin did step down as president in 2008, but in many respects, he kept control as Russia\u2019s prime minister. Nursultan Nazarbayev stepped aside as president in Kazakhstan in 2019, but only after staying in power for 29 years and extending his term in office indefinitely in 2009.Russia is a personalist autocracy Putin seems to be following the broader logic of autocratic rule. In recent years, \u201cpersonalist autocracies\u201d \u2014 regimes centered on individuals rather than parties, as in China; or the military, as in Chile under Gen. Augusto Pinochet \u2014 have become the most common form of non-democracy. Roughly 40 percent of non-democracies fit this category. Prominent personalist autocrats include Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Turkey and the late Hugo Ch\u00e1vez in Venezuela, both of whom also pushed for constitutional changes to allow them to extend their terms. Personalist autocracies have been the most common form of government in the former Soviet Union since the end of the U.S.S.R. in 1991.So much for Putin\u2019s promise he\u2019d abide by term limits. Here\u2019s what\u2019s happening.Several studies suggest the risks to personalist autocrats of ceding power. Hein Goemans collected data on all non-democracies from 1946 to 2008 and found that 70 percent of rulers in personalist autocracies lost office through coups, revolts or other nonconstitutional means vs. 47 percent for military regimes and just 19 percent for one-party autocracies. In addition, 80 percent of rulers in personalist autocracies ended up in jail, in exile or dead after leaving office, compared with 41 percent for rulers in military regimes and 25 percent for rulers in one-party autocracies. Rulers in military regimes can return to the barracks, and leaders of one-party regimes can return to the party, but personalist autocrats have no soft landing pad.ADADRussia is better educated, more ethnically homogenous and wealthier than most personalist autocracies. These factors might smooth a political transition, but the odds are not good.What does viewing Putin\u2019s Russia as a personalist autocracy tell us? Most important, replacing Russia\u2019s leader might change very little \u2014 after all, another personalist autocrat in the Kremlin would be likely to follow Putin\u2019s example. Rulers tend to step down from office when they can feel relatively secure that their successor will respect their rights. That outcome is harder to achieve in a personalist autocracy than in a military regime or one-party autocracy.At a minimum, the constitutional amendments should allow Putin greater leverage over rivals at home and abroad until 2024. At a maximum, he will run for president in 2024 and again in 2030, and retire when he is 84. But as long as Russia remains a personalist autocracy, Putin is unlikely to find a peaceful retirement when he leaves office \u2014 and that\u2019s why he will try to stay in power.ADADThe TMC newsletter has moved!

Trump\u2019s personal qualities are regarded negatively. \u201cA 54% majority describes [former vice president Joe] Biden as caring about the needs of ordinary people; only 41% say this phrase describes Trump very or somewhat well. And more voters say Biden is a good role model and describe him as honest than say that about Trump, by 15 percentage points and 12 points, respectively.\u201dADADThe president\u2019s handling of issues is likewise viewed negatively. Once a strong suit, his handling of the economy wins only 51 percent approval, with handling of race (35 percent) and ability to unify the country (31 percent) even worse.No wonder Trump trails Biden by 10 points (54 percent to 44 percent). Remarkably, Biden has closed the gap among male voters to within two points of Trump, while sailing ahead of Trump among women by a 57 percent to 41 percent margin. Biden also leads handily in battleground states 52 percent to 46 percent. It should be noted that the poll was taken before news of the Russian bounties broke; it is quite possible his numbers are now even worse.Sign up for The Odds newsletter for election updates from data columnist David BylerThe story is much the same in the latest USA Today/Suffolk poll, where Trump\u2019s approval rating clocks in at a shabby 40 percent and Biden leads 53 percent to 41 percent. Moreover, \u201cThe findings have a warning flare for Republicans down the ballot. Asked about their vote for Congress in November, 51% of those surveyed say they are inclined to support an unnamed Democratic candidate; 37% say they are inclined to support an unnamed Republican.\u201d In addition, Biden leads on six of seven issues \u2014 \u201crace relations, the COVID-19 pandemic, health care, immigration, national security and dealing with China\u201d \u2014 while Trump barely leads on the economy (47 percent to 45 percent). On personal qualities, Biden receives positive ratings on bringing the country together, having a vision for the country, caring \u201cabout people like you,\u201d getting things done, keeping his promises and being honest and trustworthy; Trump rates negatively on all but having a vision and receives split marks on getting things done.One point deserves emphasis: Biden is over 50 percent in head-to-head match-ups while Trump is stuck in the low 40s. To turn this around, Trump would have to convince some current Biden voters \u2014 not merely undecideds \u2014 to vote for him.

As she entered 2020, her 15th year in office, she looked\u00a0exhausted. Having ruled out a fifth term and resigned as boss of her party, she was in effect a lame duck.\u00a0But Covid changed all that. It\u00a0rejuvenated Merkel as a leader.As a trained quantum chemist, she\u2019s been managing\u00a0the outbreak like the scientist she is, with pragmatic policies based on the expertise of epidemiologists. In polls, she became Germany\u2019s most popular politician\u00a0again, with an approval rating of 71%.\u00a0ADADBut as she nears\u00a0the end of her time in office, her legacy still seems\u00a0questionable. Aside from Covid, her domestic record is\u00a0mediocre, with no economic reform worth speaking of. In European politics, she was often divisive. During the refugee crisis of 2015, she shocked her European partners by unilaterally opening Germany\u2019s borders to migrants for several chaotic months. Before that, during the euro crisis, she alienated Greeks and other southerners by forcing them into fiscal \u201causterity.\u201dThe consensus in Berlin and other capitals was that Merkel, who spent half her life living in communist East Germany, had a cerebral connection to the idea of European integration and identity, not an emotional one. She was seen to do just enough during crises to prevent dissolution, but never enough \u2014\u00a0even when French President Emmanuel Macron begged her \u2014\u00a0to move the European Union forward.And then, surprisingly, Covid changed that.\u00a0Early in the outbreak, as member states closed their borders, hoarded medical equipment and suspended the single market, Merkel glimpsed a scenario in which the EU might become irrelevant or even unravel. And she felt genuine fear.ADADSo Merkel and\u00a0Macron\u00a0restarted\u00a0the traditional Franco-German \u201cengine\u201d that powers the EU. They\u00a0 proposed a 500 billion-euro ($562 billion) fund to give grants to\u00a0member states, such as Italy and Spain, that suffered most in the pandemic. Another German leader, Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, then slapped an additional 250 billion euros on top in loans.The biggest surprise was Merkel\u2019s consent to financing this fund with bonds issued by the Commission. This seemed to be a baby step toward mutualized debt and the European \u201ctransfer union\u201d that she\u2019d always resisted. It could imply a more federal EU, with European tax revenues in the future. That would require treaty change and fall to Merkel\u2019s successors. But for this German chancellor, her conversion was almost Damascene.It could also secure her the legacy she still lacks, provided she makes the plan\u00a0reality. And it really is now up to her. On Wednesday, Germany takes over\u00a0the rotating presidency of the Council of the EU, the institution that represents the 27 member states and co-legislates with the European Parliament. For the rest of this year, the EU\u2019s\u00a0largest country formally has the role Germans  have long been resisting: of being Europe\u2019s leader.ADADThe European coronavirus fund will consume much of her effort. Getting\u00a0all 27 countries to accept it \u2014\u00a0Merkel wants a deal in time for the European summit on July 17 \u2014\u00a0will be fiendishly difficult.\u00a0She also has to get agreement on the EU\u2019s next seven-year budget. And she wants to stabilize\u00a0relations with China, which have been getting worse, to do more with Africa,\u00a0to jump-start Europe\u2019s \u201cGreen Deal\u201d and digital transformation \u2014\u00a0and generally to make Europe more credible  in a dangerous world.That\u2019s a lot for any leader. So how does\u00a0Merkel plan to go about it? Before she became Commission president, Von der Leyen once described to me the quintessential German style of statecraft as \u201cleading from the center.\u201d I used to sneer at that phrase as German waffling to get out of real leadership \u2014 the kind you do from the front, with others following.But in this\u00a0unusual year in world history, I\u2019m having second thoughts. What\u2019s kept Merkel in power all these years is her empathy. She has a knack for sensing what motivates others and keeping them at the proverbial table. She does this with every tool at her disposal, from sober logic to subtle body language.ADADIn certain contexts, leading from the center may be the highest form of the political art \u2014\u00a0as also practised by Jacinda Ardern in New Zealand, Mette Frederiksen in Denmark and Tsai Ing-Wen in Taiwan. If Merkel in these coming months holds Europe together, that will be her legacy.

Subscribe today.arrow-rightTrump is not to blame for the recent surge in overdose deaths. Dealing with addiction is difficult in the midst of a pandemic, when services are harder to access and individuals are suffering from stress and loneliness. But it is fair to ask whether an administration that touted itself as \u201cdedicated\u201d to ending the opioid epidemic could have done more.ADADThe numbers are still incomplete, but the available information is bleak. The White House drug policy office reported an 11.4 percent year-over-year increase in overdose deaths for the first four months of 2020. Data from the Overdose Detection Mapping Application Program \u2014 a federal initiative that attempts to collect real-time data on overdoses \u2014 also show that suspected overdoses (including non-fatal overdoses) have accelerated this year. Overdoses in February were 16 percent higher than they were in February of last year. Since then, it has only gotten worse: March overdoses were up 18 percent compared with last year, April overdoses increased 29 percent, and May overdoses rose a stunning 42 percent. Full coverage of the coronavirus pandemicThose sterile statistics don\u2019t capture the horror on the ground. Places where things seemed to be improving are starting to look like they did at the height of the epidemic just a few years ago. Coroners\u2019 facilities are overrun with bodies. Emergency responders are struggling to keep up. Families must navigate the trauma of needless death on top of planning a funeral during a pandemic.Two factors are driving this crisis. The first is the persistence of dangerous synthetic opioids such as fentanyl, often mixed in with other drugs such as methamphetamine and cocaine. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has yet to release final data for 2019, but preliminary data show that despite progress in reducing deaths in 2018, they began to inch upward again last year.ADADThe second is the novel coronavirus, which has devastated the economy and caused a torrent of stress and social isolation that exacerbates substance abuse. Meanwhile, many treatment centers \u2014 starved of revenue because of social distancing and confronted with massive new costs for personal protective equipment \u2014 have been forced to close or pare back programs. Many teeter on the cusp of financial collapse.The administration has taken some useful steps in response to the pandemic. It relaxed regulations to make it easier for patients to access medication that helps stave off withdrawal symptoms for opioid users. But for some patients, that intervention came too late. Meanwhile, many mental health and addiction treatment centers received either too little aid from the federal aid package for health-care providers or were left out of the package entirely, meaning they\u2019re desperately holding out for another round of money from Congress.So where is the president? He hasn\u2019t demanded that Congress do more to shore up treatment centers. He hasn\u2019t pushed his administration to draw attention to the surging deaths. Instead, his administration has too often used the spike in deaths as a political prop to argue that coronavirus lockdowns were unjustified. Lockdowns were always inevitable; the question is whether the government was prepared to deal with the fallout. Clearly, this administration was not.ADADThe lack of leadership on the opioid crisis predates even the pandemic. Public health experts regularly bemoan the administration\u2019s inability to secure any meaningful funding to address the problem. Treatment drugs remain far too difficult for people to access; the White House itself reported in February that almost 400,000 people with drug addiction attempted to get treatment in 2018 (the most recent data available) but failed to do so.We are interested in hearing about how the struggle to reopen amid the pandemic is affecting people's lives. Please tell us yours.The administration has made much of its effort to curtail the flow of dangerous drugs from outside the country, casting China and drug dealers south of our borders as convenient political villains. But given the ongoing threat of fentanyl, that, too, has been a failure.Perhaps the president\u2019s rhetoric on the addiction epidemic was empty all along. Perhaps he hasn\u2019t called attention to the rise in overdoses because doing so would put a spotlight on his administration\u2019s efforts in court to dismantle the Affordable Care Act \u2014 and with it the expanded Medicaid coverage that so many people fighting addiction rely upon.ADADOr perhaps Trump isn\u2019t talking about these \u201cforgotten men and women\u201d because he has forgotten them, too.Read more:Jim Carroll: Here\u2019s how Trump is helping people fight addiction during the pandemicThe Post\u2019s View: Congress should act to allow a ban on fentanyl indefinitelyRobert Gebelhoff: The solutions to the opioid crisis are clear.

Subscribe today.arrow-rightAnd yet, there\u2019s still a danger that humanity will fail in its quest to control Covid-19. The culprit wouldn\u2019t necessarily be the medical complexity, fiendish as it is, of engineering a vaccine. It could also be the ensuing politics surrounding inoculation. The fights will be intense, irrational and sometimes nasty.The first problem is that even after we become confident that a particular vaccine is effective and safe, there won\u2019t be enough for everyone. So we\u2019ll have to decide: Who should get the shots first? Who won\u2019t get any? These questions will come up between countries, and within them.ADADGiven the right leadership, the world would overcome these difficulties with dignity and wisdom. Forty years ago, for example, as the world shivered in a Cold War between the U.S. and the Soviet Union, humanity nonetheless managed to unite and eradicate smallpox.Today, however, the odds for health-care multilateralism are bad. A new Cold War is underway between the U.S. and China. And a \u201cMy Country First\u201d nationalism is infecting ever more countries, including several of those working on vaccines. \u00a0Rich nations will try to outbid poor ones in securing supplies of the vaccine. And someone like U.S. President Donald Trump may not necessarily \u201cshare\u201d a scarce vaccine invented and made in America with other countries. German officials were outraged earlier this year after reports \u2014\u00a0never confirmed \u2014\u00a0that Trump tried to buy CureVac, a German company working on a vaccine, in order to get exclusive access.ADADEthical problems of triage will also haunt domestic politics. Most people will agree that health-care workers on the front lines should get first dibs on jabs. But, after that, nothing is clear. Should pregnant women get priority? What about the elderly? They\u2019re in greatest danger of dying if infected, but they respond much less to vaccination than younger people do. So if herd immunity is the goal, inoculating the old may not make sense.On it goes, with increasingly charged decisions. What about \u201cessential workers,\u201d and who are they anyway? Migrant workers and prisoners live in cramped conditions. Should they jump the queue? Not least, in this time of Black Lives Matter, there\u2019s the question of whether ethnicity should in some cases confer priority. In the U.S., Black and Latino people are suffering disproportionately from Covid-19. Should\u00a0they get shots before Whites?If these dilemmas are political\u00a0dynamite, they may end up looking trivial next to what\u2019s sure to be the biggest showdown: the standoff between scientific rationality and conspiracy theories. Early in the pandemic, there were hopes that the balderdash of anti-vaxxers would become untenable and their movement would atrophy. Instead, it\u2019s booming.ADADHumans have always spun conspiracy theories, especially at times of calamity. The anxiety that comes with loss of control primes people to seek simple explanations with compelling story lines and an obvious culprit. Unsurprisingly, the Covid-19 epidemic has been accompanied all along by\u00a0an \u201cinfodemic.\u201dFor example, a\u00a0fake-news video called \u201cPlandemic,\u201d claiming that the new coronavirus was hype and that a vaccine would kill millions, was viewed more than 7 million times on YouTube before it was taken down. Demonstrators from Germany to the U.S.\u00a0have been spreading bizarre fantasies that Bill Gates, one of the world\u2019s great\u00a0philanthropists, conspired with \u201cBig Pharma\u201d to engineer SARS-CoV-2 so he could establish a global health dictatorship. He\u2019ll police this with microchips implanted under your skin. There\u2019s no end to this bilge available on the internet.None of this is funny. Conspiracy theories have already led to anti-vaxxers refusing to get shots against measles, thus compromising the already-achieved\u00a0herd immunity and causing new outbreaks of this deadly disease. The same could happen when a coronavirus vaccine\u00a0becomes available.\u00a0The threshold for herd immunity against Covid-19 is estimated at between 55% and 82% of a given population. But only about 50% of Americans\u00a0say they\u2019d\u00a0get vaccinated.ADADSo the time for corona statecraft\u00a0and education is now, before the vaccine arrives. Internationally, countries are likely to be most open to multilateral solutions\u00a0before it\u2019s clear which nation will first develop a vaccine. Domestically, the debate about who has priority has the best chance of staying scientific\u00a0before people are clamoring for jabs. Above all, educating people to distinguish facts from fake news is effective only before they become exposed to, and infected by, conspiracy theories.

Like Trump, he\u2019s under fire at home after letting complacency define his initial response to the coronavirus pandemic.ADADL\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s scheduled Wednesday appearance at the White House provides a strange coda to the final months of the U.S. president\u2019s term. Trump\u2019s campaign was launched, notoriously, on anti-Mexican animus: He decried Mexican \u201crapists,\u201d demonized a judge of Mexican heritage and repeatedly vowed to build a wall between the United States and Mexico, which Mexico would pay for. The southern neighbor became the locus of much that ails Trump\u2019s America \u2014 a beneficiary of unfair trade deals, the staging ground for \u201ccaravans\u201d of illegal infiltrators, the abode of menacing cartels and other criminal elements.For AMLO \u2014 a common nickname for the Mexican president \u2014 Trump, too, presented a useful political foil. Before his election, he spoke of Trump as a \u201cneo-fascist\u201d he likened to Hitler and as \u201can irresponsible bully\u201d whose border wall plans were a \u201cmonument to hypocrisy and cruelty.\u201dBut since L\u00f3pez Obrador came to power it has been a different story. The populist presidents have cultivated a conspicuously amicable friendship, despite the borders that separate them and their politics. Under AMLO\u2019s watch, Mexico has diverted security resources to clamp down on migrants traveling into the country over its southern border. Facing the White House\u2019s punitive tariffs, it agreed to the Trump administration\u2019s controversial Migrant Protection Protocols, which force would-be asylum seekers to await their cases in often unsafe camps in Mexico.ADAD\u201cWe should not have people forced to wait for asylum \u2014 trying to find safety for themselves and their families \u2014 while camped outside in the elements for months at a time,\u201d Sister Norma Pimentel, director of a Texas-based Catholic charity that works with migrants, wrote in a Washington Post op-ed last week. \u201cIt is contrary to our laws and the dictates of humanity.\u201dDemocratic lawmakers in the United States warned that AMLO\u2019s arrival risks politicizing the U.S.-Mexico relationship by shifting the focus away from the disaster of the pandemic. In Mexico, critics have also decried the visit, not least because it appears to endorse an American president with a long track record of demonizing immigrants and insulting Mexicans. Others contend that Mexico has little choice but to find common ground with the White House.\u201cWe are talking about the most powerful man on Earth, Mexico\u2019s most important trade partner. You want to be on good terms with that person,\u201d Viridiana R\u00edos, a Mexican political analyst, told the Guardian. \u201cAt some point during his campaign, [Trump] is going to scapegoat Mexico and Mexicans again. But the key thing is policy: Do we get more out of a Donald Trump who feels empathy towards AMLO and towards his government, or not?\u201d In Washington, optimists hope that differences over immigration won\u2019t disrupt proceedings. The two leaders will celebrate the start of the United States-Mexico-Canada trade deal, a moderately altered version of the previous North American Free Trade Agreement, which Trump vociferously attacked in his campaigning. \u201cThe deal offers investors certainty, but 95 percent of it is basically the same as NAFTA,\u201d Valeria Moy, an economist and professor at the Instituto Tecnol\u00f3gico Aut\u00f3nomo de M\u00e9xico, told my colleagues.ADADCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau opted out of the gathering, placing the spotlight firmly on the other two leaders. Some analysts see them as a pair of demagogic peas in a pod.\u201cBoth seek the absolute dominance of the executive branch,\u201d wrote the Mexican commentator Enrique Krauze. \u201cThey dismiss institutions and the rule of law. They attack the critical independent press: Trump cries \u2018fake news,\u2019 while L\u00f3pez Obrador repeats, \u2018I have other data.\u2019 They scorn science and have confronted the pandemic irresponsibly and ineffectively, and with total lack of empathy. Both cultivate a twisted cult of personality.\u201d\u201cThe two leaders are ideological foes but in some ways kindred spirits: populists whose strengths are in the realm of symbols rather than the substance of government,\u201d noted the Economist.ADADThe significance of L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s visit is expected to remain a mostly symbolic one. Analysts don\u2019t see the leaders emerging from the proceedings with much more than what already has been accomplished. And even then, progress remains somewhat thin.\u201cEconomists say the trade deal is unlikely to drive much new foreign investment, given uncertainty created by the L\u00f3pez Obrador administration,\u201d my colleagues reported. \u201cHe has canceled a new Mexico City airport project and a U.S. firm\u2019s $1.4 billion brewery in Mexicali on allegations of corruption, and backpedaled on reforms to open the energy sector to more private investment.\u201dThe upshot of this summit, argued Genaro Lozano, a professor at Mexico City\u2019s Iberoamerican University, may have little to do with the principals involved. \u201cBoth Republicans and Democrats need to take Mexico and the region as a whole more seriously,\u201d he wrote in Americas Quarterly. \u201cIntegration between the two economies and societies is unstoppable and, if nothing else, Mexico should be a regular stop for U.S. presidential candidates, just as the U.S. is a stop for any Mexican presidential candidate.\u201dRead more: Why Guyana\u2019s political stalemate mattersChina strangles its world cityPutin\u2019s term-limit win suggests stagnation, not strength", "comment": "62 Comments", "topic": "Today's WorldView"}, {"cover": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ZTI6HVWATII6VCIINCRLT2XJ4A.jpghttps://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ZTI6HVWATII6VCIINCRLT2XJ4A.jpg", "title": "How big cities became inequality machines", "date": "Jul 8, 2020", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/07/08/how-cities-failed-black-middle-class/", "keyword": "China and Security", "website": "the Washington Post", "author": "Andrew Van Dam", "content": "For Americans without an elite profession, connections or education, cities were once the ultimate ticket to the middle class.This held particularly true for black workers who moved from smaller communities to cities to be factory and construction workers, office assistants and salespeople supporting the countries\u2019 fast-innovating urban economies. They earned a substantial premium over their small-town counterparts.Support our journalism. Subscribe today.arrow-rightAround the turn of the millennium, something broke, new data suggests. Moving to cities is still a pretty good choice for most white people. But for black Americans, especially those without a college degree, cities no longer guarantee the kinds of opportunity they used to.ADConsider the below chart, part of a new report by leading labor economist David Autor of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Autor calculates growth rates from 1980 to 2015, then measures how different those growth rates have been in the biggest cities vs. smaller ones. Here, Autor calculates that since 1980, pay for urban white people with college degrees increased between 6 percentage points for men and 13 percentage points for women more quickly than it did for their small-community counterparts \u2014 even after adjusting for inflation. He did this by comparing Census Bureau data for the most urban quarter of the country with the least urban one.Black families pay significantly higher property taxes than white families, new analysis showsFor whites without a college education, this urban premium has remained steady. But for black people without a college degree, the urban premium has plummeted. Black men in big cities saw their wages grow 17 points more slowly than their small-community counterparts; for black women, the gap was 13 points.Even college-educated black Americans have seen fewer gains, while educated white folks have thrived in cities. Hispanic Americans are in a similar, albeit less pronounced, situation.\u201cAn increasing share of GDP is produced by just a relatively small handful of superstar cities and people are paying an arm and leg just to get in there,\u201d Autor said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s where you go if you\u2019re highly educated and highly specialized. So college grads have done well in urban places, but white college graduates have done much better than blacks and Hispanics.\u201dThe wage growth gap doesn\u2019t even factor in housing costs, Autor said. When accounting for housing and other cost-of-living factors, less-educated, urban black and Hispanic workers earn less now than they would have made compared with their small-city counterparts in 1980.ADADWhat happened? Automation replaced many of the jobs that had lifted less-skilled workers into the middle class. By the turn of the millennium, corporations had turned to spreadsheets, fancy phone systems and robots to replace specialists in many repetitive jobs. Lower-paying service sector jobs at restaurants, retailers and hotels rose up to take their place.Plus, many middle-class factory and manufacturing jobs that lured African Americans to big cities during the Great Migration have been automated or completely lost, as companies moved jobs to lower-wage countries such as Mexico and, particularly, China after 2000.Administrative assistant jobs helped propel many women into the middle class. Now they\u2019re disappearing.\u201cMiddle-skill work that was available was no longer available. And so they are crowded into a narrower set of traditionally lower-paid, lower-productivity occupations,\u201d Autor said.The pattern of occupational polarization will be familiar to anyone who has followed Autor\u2019s work, but his newest research adds an important dimension.\u201cPolarization has not been evenly felt. It\u2019s much more concentrated among minorities,\u201d said Autor, who also helps direct the MIT Task Force on the Work of the Future, which released the study. \u201cChanges in occupational structure, in cities, have been larger and arguably less favorable among blacks and Hispanics than among whites.\u201dFirst, consider the plight of big-city college graduates. Especially among black and Hispanic college graduates, middle-wage jobs have decreased relative to the smallest communities, but the decline is somewhat subdued and \u2014 for many of these most-educated workers \u2014 somewhat offset by gains in higher-skill jobs.When you look at that pattern for city-dwelling workers without a bachelor\u2019s degree, the labor-market carnage becomes immediately evident. The losses of middle-wage jobs are much more severe, especially for black and Hispanic workers. These jobs have been replaced almost entirely by low-paying roles such as janitors, cooks, waiters, transportation workers, repair workers and security guards.ADADWith that in mind, look at Autor\u2019s charts showing how cities were once engines of middle-class opportunity for all workers, but evolved to be the province of the top-earning elite and the less-educated, low-paid workers who serve them. Focus on the slope of each line. When it\u2019s higher toward the right, it means people are earning more in big cities than they are in the smallest ones. That\u2019s the urban wage premium.For college grads, the line just keeps getting steeper, meaning cities are paying graduates more and more. Meanwhile, in 1980 the urban premium for less-educated workers is about equal to that of their educated peers, but the relationship soon breaks down. By 2015, the line is almost flat, indicating less-educated workers don\u2019t earn much more in major cities than they do in tiny ones. And overall, their urban wages have actually deteriorated, adjusting for inflation.\u201cWhat we learn from Autor\u2019s work is that non-college workers can no longer expect that moving to a high-paying city will be a mechanism of upward mobility,\u201d said Melissa Kearney, a University of Maryland labor economist. Kearney was not directly involved in the research, but she directs the Economic Strategy Group at the Aspen Institute, which commissioned the paper.ADADLess urban areas have changed too, exacerbating the gap between big cities and small ones. Over the years, smaller cities \u2014 think Cumberland, Md.; Duluth, Minn. or Santa Fe, N.M. \u2014 find their demand for skilled workers increasing, even as they have fewer and fewer workers available, Autor said.He found that, outside of large cities \u2014 such as New York, San Francisco or Tampa \u2014 workers without a college education are moving into managerial roles.\u201cGrowing inequality is not just about robots and automation eliminating middle-skill jobs, said Elisabeth Reynolds,\u201d executive director of the MIT task force. \u201cOther factors have contributed, including import competition in manufacturing, a stagnant federal minimum wage and a decline in unions.AD\u201cThere\u2019s a host of different policy decisions that have been taken that have, in the end, weakened the position of workers in terms of their earnings as well as their voice,\u201d she said.ADNow, it seems, there\u2019s a new layer of difficulty for black and Hispanic workers, on top of less wage growth in big cities.\u201cMinority populations are bearing the public health and economic costs of this current pandemic recession harder than others,\u201d Kearney said. \u201cThis is just another episode where we\u2019re seeing that the least advantaged among us are bearing the largest burdens.\u201dMany less-educated, minority workers already have lost their jobs. Just half of the black adult population is employed, and the service industry will never be the same. Autor points out that, as white-collar workers use their newfound work-from-home leverage to scatter throughout the country, service-industry workers will once again be left behind.\u201cOur whole understanding of urban and service-related jobs will be shifted,\u201d Reynolds said. \u201cThings will change after this.

Subscribe today.arrow-rightThe Israeli leader is under pressure from settler groups and political parties further to his right to extend Israeli sovereignty over as much as 30 percent of the West Bank as soon as possible, before President Trump\u2019s potential departure from office. Through major policy concessions to Israel over the past three years, as well as its controversial blueprint for Middle East \u201cpeace\u201d unveiled in January, the White House has shown its willingness to move beyond the long-cherished U.S. goal of a \u201ctwo-state solution\u201d in favor of a new status quo more aligned with the interests of the Israeli right.ADAD\u201cApplying Israeli law to much of the West Bank would mean the irreversible end of the Palestinian statehood project, making [Netanyahu] the prime minister who not only buried the two-state solution but annexed choice West Bank real estate,\u201d wrote Aaron David Miller, a former U.S. diplomat and veteran of earlier rounds of Israel-Palestinian peace talks.The rest of the world \u2014 including many lawmakers and pundits in Washington \u2014 still clings to the vision of a viable, independent Palestinian state. Netanyahu\u2019s annexation plans were, of course, rejected by the Palestinian leadership, who suspended cooperation with Israel\u2019s security and civil agencies in protest. But they are also overwhelmingly opposed by the international community: E.U. officials have raised the prospect of sanctions; left-leaning Democrats in the United States now want to suspend or condition military aid to Israel based on its behavior; a host of Arab states engaged in a tacit rapprochement with Israel have warned that annexation would doom their budding friendship.The consensus view among analysts of Israeli politics is that Netanyahu will take a less aggressive approach, perhaps initially extending sovereignty over a small handful of settlement blocs. Announcing \u201csome form of annexation-lite,\u201d explained my colleague Steve Hendrix, would allow Netanyahu \u201cand President Trump \u2014 who both have seen booming economies collapse \u2014 to focus on other fronts.\u201dBut for Palestinians, there\u2019s no moving on. The Palestinian Authority, the entity created to help shepherd the two-state solution forward in concert with the Israelis and the international community, is in deep crisis. It\u2019s at odds with a right-wing Netanyahu government that shows little interest in meeting even baseline Palestinian demands; is facing bankruptcy; is mired in a dysfunctional intra-Palestinian standoff between mainstream factions and the Islamist group Hamas in Gaza; and has become increasingly unpopular among ordinary Palestinians, the majority of whom \u201cnow see the PA as a liability, not an asset,\u201d said Ghaith al-Omari, a former adviser to the Palestinian side in peace talks two decades ago.ADADIf Netanyahu presses ahead with annexation, prominent Palestinian officials fear a definitive end to their already enfeebled statehood project and a future shorn of equal rights of citizenship, where their lives and movements are forever curtailed by the imperatives of the Israeli security state. \u201cIt means that I, as a Palestinian, will not be able to do anything without their permission,\u201d Saeb Erekat, secretary general of the Palestine Liberation Organization, told my colleague Ruth Eglash. \u201cIt means they will control my movements, my planning, my borders and my access to everything. \u2026 They are trying to suffocate me, bury me, and they think I will stand for it?\u201dOthers contend that years of Israeli occupation, land grabs and settlement expansion in the West Bank and around East Jerusalem had already cemented this reality. \u201cContrary to the popular narrative, annexation will not kill the two-state solution \u2014 you cannot kill something that has long been dead,\u201d wrote Yousef Munayyer, a Palestinian American scholar. \u201cRather, annexation is dragging and displaying the two-state solution\u2019s corpse before the world.\u201d\u201cIf you ask Palestinians in the Jordan Valley how they feel about annexation, many will tell you that they thought we had already been annexed long ago,\u201d wrote Salem Barahmeh, executive director of the Palestine Institute for Public Diplomacy, based in the West Bank city of Ramallah. \u201cThis is why we cannot help but ridicule the world\u2019s growing, alarmist, and existential outcry as we approach July 1.\u201dIndeed, the alarm in Washington has been loudest among Israel\u2019s traditional defenders. They argue against annexation on pragmatic, policy terms, recognizing that the current status quo of ironclad Israeli control over Palestinian territory and relative global quiescence over an indefinite military occupation suits both Israeli and U.S. interests \u2014 more so, at least, than a unilateral move that will provoke a backlash from Palestinians and governments elsewhere.ADADBut critics on the Israeli left argue that the case against annexation ought to be one of morality, not tactics. \u201cDuring the era of slavery in the United States, and apartheid in South Africa, there were those who profited from the social order that was enshrined in law at the time,\u201d wrote Yehuda Shaul, one of the founders of Breaking the Silence, an organization of former Israeli soldiers who speak out against the abuses of the occupation.\u201cA fair person isn\u2019t interested in having the society in which he lives imitate their ways,\u201d he added. \u201cAnyone living in a country that was founded as a result of a U.N. resolution, one based on the right to self-determination, would have to betray himself to deny the native people who live alongside us that very same right.\u201dRead more: China\u2019s campaign of \u2018genocide\u2019 could bring the U.S. and E.U. closer togetherThe world\u2019s climate catastrophe worsens amid the pandemicLatin America\u2019s coronavirus crisis is only getting worse", "comment": "382 Comments", "topic": "Today's WorldView"}, {"cover": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/UL2BB3VWPMI6VGQ52PNRZPQHZY.jpghttps://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/UL2BB3VWPMI6VGQ52PNRZPQHZY.jpg", "title": "Here\u2019s how an unpopular ruling party swept Mongolia\u2019s June elections", "date": "Jul 7, 2020", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/07/07/heres-how-an-unpopular-ruling-party-swept-mongolias-june-elections/", "keyword": "China and Security", "website": "the Washington Post", "author": "", "content": "When Mongolia held its June 24 parliamentary elections, more than 73 percent of voters turned up despite the heavy rains, and followed strict two-meter distancing requirements to avoid spreading the novel coronavirus.

Subscribe today.arrow-rightThe main opposition Democratic Party (DP) came in a distant second, winning 11 seats with 25 percent of the total votes. Two minor parties and an independent candidate won the remaining three seats. Of the 606 total candidates, 121 ran as an independent, far more than any previous election. Overall, a record number of candidates from 13 parties and four electoral coalitions competed this year.Why so many parties \u2014 and so many independent candidates? This was a direct response to the widespread public distrust of the two major parties, as both the MPP and the DP\u00ad were involved in corruption scandals in recent years.ADADDespite its unpopularity, here\u2019s how the MPP managed to win, and what these results mean for this young democracy.The MPP manipulated the electoral rulesMongolia\u2019s ruling parties have frequently and arbitrarily manipulated the electoral rules to benefit themselves at the expense of third parties, often changing the system shortly before election day. In December, the MPP replaced the single-member district plurality system used in the previous election with a multi-member district plurality voting.Here\u2019s how democracy is eroding in MongoliaMongolia had used this type of \u201cblock-voting\u201d only twice in the past. In both of those elections, the MPP won. Elsewhere in the world, only eight countries use this system, including Kuwait, Mauritius and Syria.ADUnder the current block-voting rules, Mongolia now has 29 electoral districts that are uneven in terms of population, and each district chooses two or three members of parliament. The winners in each constituency were determined by those with the most votes. But this \u201cwinners take all\u201d approach discouraged voters from supporting minor parties, and encouraged them to support candidates from one of the two major parties.ADThe MPP redrew the electoral map, providing 52 of 76 seats to rural districts where its support base has been robust. The capital city of Ulaanbaatar, where nearly half of Mongolian citizens live, now has just 24 seats, or one-third of the total. This is four seats fewer than the last election.The new rules also increased the size, in terms of both land and population, of electoral districts \u2014 and that benefited established parties with more resources, like the MPP. Recent elections have also restricted the official campaigning period to 21 days, a period too short for lesser-known candidates to make their case to a large number of voters.ADLow virus cases may have boosted support for the governmentFollowing the initial outbreak of the coronavirus in Wuhan, Mongolia became the second country, after North Korea, to close its border with China. In early February, the MPP government canceled a national holiday, prohibited all international travel, closed public facilities, instituted social distancing measures and required citizens to wear masks. On the eve of election day, Mongolia had logged 215 confirmed cases, all of them imported.ADA zero rate community spread of the virus bolstered the MPP\u2019s governing credentials at a time when citizens were wary of covid-19, the disease caused by the virus. A recent public opinion survey revealed that covid-19 was the third most pressing sociopolitical problem facing Mongolian citizens. Nearly half of the respondents in the poll said the government\u2019s most significant success had been its response to the pandemic.In Mongolia, proposed legislation endangers civil societyThe DP suffered from internal strifeADThe MPP campaigned on its successful pandemic response well as reducing air pollution, which has reached toxic levels in recent years. Another major theme of the MPP campaign was social justice and fighting corruption. Prime Minister Khurelsukh portrayed himself as a decisive leader courageously taking on what he calls \u201cthe 30 rich families\u201d who unjustly benefit from the country\u2019s vast mineral resources, at the expense of ordinary citizens.ADIn contrast, the DP failed to run a cohesive campaign with a unified message. The MPP attacked the party\u2019s leader, Erdene Sodnomzundui, for allegedly having sold the DP candidate slots to whomever paid the most money. He did not actively campaign on behalf of other DP candidates, in contrast to the prime minister \u2014 who managed to tour the country in less than three weeks to muster voter support. Factional disputes plagued the DP, prompting some of its prominent leaders to set up a third party before the election and others to run independent campaigns, effectively splitting the party\u2019s support base.The two major parties\u2019 election platforms differed little. Both promised to create jobs through direct government involvement in the economy, especially in heavy industry and mining. There were no major policy debates \u2014 instead, the election was more about the personality of the party leaders. The MPP succeeded in casting the race as a choice between its popular leader Khurelsukh and the uncharismatic DP leader, Erdene.Some European governments acted quickly to fight the pandemic. But not the ones you\u2019d expect.Six candidates were arrestedADADThis year\u2019s election was the eighth parliamentary election in Mongolia\u2019s democratic history, which began with a peaceful transition from communism in 1990. However, for the first time in these 30 years, six candidates \u2014 four from opposition parties, one independent and one from the MPP \u2014 were arrested during the campaign. Five were prominent politicians who have been in direct conflict with either President Battulga Khaltmaa or Prime Minister Khurelsukh, suggesting that these arrests were politically motivated.The arrests appear to be a clear violation of Mongolia\u2019s Law on Elections, which provides election candidates with immunity from prosecution. To observers, the arrests were a worrying development following the threats to democracy from last year\u2019s controversial law that threatened judicial independence.

But that initial surge soon fizzled, leaving the retailer\u2019s brick-and-mortar business down more than one-third.Support our journalism. Subscribe today.arrow-rightSome stores reopened in malls where restaurants and movie theaters remained closed, limiting foot traffic. Outlets in major cities suffered from the absence of foreign tourists. And recent coronavirus flare-ups across the South and West convinced executives they faced a grueling recovery that could take until 2022.\u201cThe situation is really fluid. And it changes day by day,\u201d Jeff Gennette, Macy\u2019s chief executive, told investors this week on an earnings call.ADThe same could be said of the entire U.S. economy, which has defied the most pessimistic forecasts yet still faces an uncertain trek back to its former heights. With the unemployment rate at 11.1 percent, worse than at any point during the Great Recession, and output continuing to decline, the healing could go on for years.ADEmployers are rehiring workers faster than economists anticipated, at least as of mid-June when the latest Labor Department survey was taken. But more recent setbacks in the economic reopening, as the daily number of coronavirus cases topped 50,000 for the first time, have blackened the outlook.\u201cIt\u2019s going to be pretty slow going. The bottom line is this is all about public health, public health, public health,\u201d said Narayana Kocherlakota, a former Federal Reserve Bank president. \u201cThis is absolutely a multiyear recovery.\u201dADMore than half of the country has now paused or reversed plans to reopen for business, according to Goldman Sachs. Almost four months after the first shutdowns, the health situation is getting worse, not better, in states such as Florida, Texas, Arizona and California. New national data on credit card spending, restaurant reservations and small-business hours show that the recovery from the recession that began in February may already be losing steam.On Thursday, the Congressional Budget Office released its new forecast, calling for the economy to expand at an annual rate of 12.4 percent in the second half of the year, down from the 15.8 percent it projected in May. That represents unusually rapid growth, but it will follow a three-month period that is widely expected to be the worst in modern history.ADThe Atlanta Fed\u2019s real-time model estimates that the economy shrank in the quarter that ended June 30 at a rate of 35 percent.ADStill, the situation is not as bad as many economists feared. In March, as the economy plunged into the deepest recession in decades, many warned that the unemployment rate would hit 20 percent by summer.On Thursday, in contrast, the Labor Department reported that the economy created 4.8 million jobs in June, shattering the record set in May. At the White House, President Trump took a victory lap, heralding the development as \u201cspectacular \u2026 record setting \u2026 astonishing.\u201dThe president boasted of the rising stock market, robust retail sales, and a revival of consumer confidence. With customary bravado, he took credit for the rebound while laying the blame elsewhere for the plummet that had preceded it.ADAD\u201cThis is not just luck, what's happening; this is a lot of talent,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAll of this incredible news is the result of historic actions my administration has taken working with our partners in Congress to rescue the U.S. economy from a horrible event that was formed, took place in China, and came here.\u201dIndeed, Congress approved spending $3 trillion to rescue the economy while the Fed expanded its balance sheet by an additional $3 trillion to support lending to businesses, households and local governments.Yet Democrats have charged that the president\u2019s failure to combat the coronavirus by encouraging the use of masks and implementing a national testing program helped fuel the latest surge in cases.ADThe economy remains badly wounded. Nearly 19.3 million Americans are receiving unemployment benefits, almost three times the peak during the worst of the 2008-09 financial crisis and up from just 1.7 million in early March.ADThe situation is still so dire that the Fed for the first time in its 107-year history has created a program to buy the corporate bonds of blue-chip companies such as Apple, Walmart and AT&T to facilitate lending.Trump\u2019s salesmanship also risks opening a credibility gap between his rosy comments and reality. In a Fox Business interview on Wednesday, he again predicted a swift \u201cV-shaped\u201d recovery, an expectation that few economists outside his administration share. And he repeated his unfounded claim that the coronavirus will \u201cjust disappear\u201d one day.AD\u201cWe\u2019re headed back in a very strong fashion with a \u2018V,\u2019 and I think we\u2019re going to be very good with the coronavirus,\u201d the president said. \u201cI think that at some point that is going to sort of just disappear.\u201dInstead, the outlook is a start-and-stop recovery with the economy held hostage by a failure to contain the pandemic, some economists said. Adjusted for inflation, the economy will be smaller than it was at the end of 2019 until the middle of 2022, according to the CBO.ADMegan Greene, an economist with Harvard University\u2019s Kennedy School of Government, expects the unemployment rate to increase in July. Many small businesses that took advantage of a government loan program for small businesses may exhaust their borrowings next month, and enhanced unemployment insurance payments will also expire unless Congress acts.AD\u201cIt\u2019s a massive cash cliff for the economy,\u201d she said.Elsewhere, Apple, which had been among the first retailers to close during the initial pandemic shutdown, this week shuttered 77 stores in seven states for a second time. Credit and debit card spending, which had recovered steadily since mid-April, fell back in the week ending June 27, according to JP Morgan.The investment bank cited findings from a panel of 30 million Chase cardholders and said the decline was \u201csurprisingly widespread across states and demographic groups.\u201dADRestaurant reservations also have lost ground in recent days. On July 1, bookings were down 64.7 percent from one year ago, having worsened from the 57 percent decline on June 27, according to the online dining service Open Table.ADAnd Homebase, a provider of scheduling software, warned that small businesses were hitting a \u201creopening plateau.\u201d After a rush to reopen in May, progress in cities such as Houston and Phoenix has stalled, the company said. Up to 20 percent of small businesses might not survive, it added.\u201cGoing forward, my expectation is it will be more mixed,\u201d said Nathan Sheets, chief economist at PGIM Fixed Income. \u201cThe biggest question is what happens with the virus. If we could get the virus out of the way, we have an economy that is itching to get back to normal.\u201dThere is ample evidence that the pandemic retains its iron grip on the $21 trillion economy.ADIn Texas, United Auto Workers Local 276 last week asked General Motors to halt production at its Arlington assembly plant out of concern over the spreading virus, a request the automaker refused as unnecessary in light of company safety protocols. \u201cEvery day we are setting new records in the number of people who are testing positive in the Dallas-Fort Worth area,\u201d the union said on its website.In New York City, Mayor Bill de Blasio halted indefinitely plans to allow restaurants and bars to resume indoor dining.In California, Gov. Gavin Newsom ordered mandatory business closures in 19 counties where the coronavirus is raging.While the stock market gives off a scent of euphoria \u2014 the tech-heavy Nasdaq sits at a record high \u2014 bond investors are sending a different signal. The yield on the 10-year Treasury security sits at 0.67 percent, little different from where it traded in late March, and proof that traders anticipate anemic growth.ADContinued cause for concern was evident in the 1.4 million Americans who filed for first-time unemployment benefits in the week ending June 27. That marked the 16th consecutive week that jobless claims have topped 1 million. Before March, the previous record had been 695,000 in 1982.Companies in some of the states struggling amid the worst coronavirus outbreaks continue to let workers go, contrary to the president\u2019s cheery forecast. In Florida, Levy Premium Foodservice, which handles concessions at sports facilities that are home to the NBA\u2019s Miami Heat and Orlando Magic and Major League Baseball\u2019s Tampa Bay Rays, notified the state of plans to lay off or reduce by more than 50 percent the hours worked for more than 1,400 employees.It may be years before many Americans can count on complete recovery.Over the past 70 years, the unemployment rate has declined from its recession peaks by 0.85 percentage points per year, according to a recent paper by Robert Hall, an economics professor at Stanford University, and Marianna Kudlyak, a research adviser at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco.The Fed expects the unemployment rate to be 9.3 percent at the end of this year.

Subscribe today.arrow-right\u201cI didn\u2019t believe it,\u201d Johnston said.Now health-care workers across Texas are seeing those alarming predictions come true, with overwhelmed testing centers, lines at emergency rooms and crowded intensive care units, where it is difficult to maintain adequate numbers of specialized staff.Many hospitals in the state are dealing with a mounting  influx of coronavirus patients and, in some places, shortages of the drug known to be effective in those who are critically ill with covid-19, the disease caused by the virus, plus staffing shortages.ADCase numbers in Texas are three times as high as they were in April, and now the curve that the state flattened with its stay-at-home order is more of an upward arrow. The state saw record-high case counts over the past week, averaging nearly 6,300 a day. More than 175,000 Texans have tested positive for covid-19 and 2,525 have died.AD\u201cThis is actually what the model predicted for a pretty open society,\u201d Johnston said. \u201cIt goes up. It continues to go up,\u201d he said.Gov. Greg Abbott (R), who was among the first governors to reopen businesses on May\u00a01, again closed bars and limited restaurant capacity last week. Abbott prohibited municipalities from implementing mandates on mask wearing and social distancing, but on Friday he required all people in counties with more than 20 coronavirus cases to wear masks while in public.ADWith the virus showing no signs of abating, some hospitals have to look elsewhere for beds for coronavirus patients. Harris Health System, which serves many uninsured patients in Houston and Harris County, has been transferring patients to other hospitals for days. Some are being sent as far as Conroe and Galveston.AD\u201cWe\u2019re pretty full,\u201d said Harris Health spokesman Bryan McLeod. The system had transferred 33 patients in the previous 24\u00a0hours and was planning to relocate 15\u00a0more, he said.Ricardo Cigarroa, an internist and cardiologist at Laredo Medical Center, said Thursday that the hospital has run out of remdesivir, the antiviral medication used to treat seriously ill patients.ADThe drug \u201chelped tremendously,\u201d he said. \u201cFor all of our sick patients who were close to being intubated, and the ones who were already intubated, it was helpful.\u201dCigarroa said the hospital has asked the state for more of the drug. He was told another shipment is coming to Texas, but there are no guarantees that the hospital will receive more.The Department of Health and Human Services said in an email that it will distribute more of the drug in mid-July. Priority goes to the states with the highest proportion of cases.AD\u201cWe await further allocations,\u201d said Roberta Schwartz, executive vice president of Houston Methodist, where there were just 250\u00a0cases in the first surge. Today, the hospital has 520 coronavirus cases and is planning for 800 to 1,000.AD\u201cWe did not expect numbers to go beyond 600,\u201d said Schwartz, who said other hospitals in the Texas Medical Center system are facing similar crunches.Over the past four months, hospitals in Texas tried to control for everything in their power. Public health leaders warned about inadequacies with testing, contact tracing,  public policy and inconsistent messaging. But they could not control what might have prevented this moment: the behavior of individual Texans.The surge of cases \u2014 reflecting the activity of recent weeks, including Memorial Day gatherings \u2014 has awakened concerns about hospital capacity, particularly in intensive care units. Most Texas hospitals \u201care probably at about 75, encroaching on that 80\u00a0percent capacity level,\u201d said Serena Bumpus, director of practice for the Texas Nurses Association and a nurse in Austin. Hospitals can convert space in their buildings for additional covid-19 patient beds. The more urgent problem is whether Texas facilities can staff those new wards, she said \u2014 a problem that could worsen  if more health-care workers fall sick even as cases increase.ADAD\u201cYou\u2019ve got nurses who are bracing themselves \u2014  they are bracing for impact. They are scared,\u201d Bumpus said. \u201cWhen this is all said and done \u2014  will there be more layoffs? Will there be furloughs? Because we\u2019ve already experienced that without the surge.\u201dAlthough some hospitals are overwhelmed and expect the situation to worsen, many doctors across the state are cautiously optimistic because they are able to draw on lessons learned during the first six months of the pandemic. Texas had time to bolster its health-care infrastructure, placing some hospitals and doctors in a confident, if wary, position to fight back, experts said.\u201cThe good news is this is within our control,\u201d said James McDeavitt, dean of clinical affairs at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston who heads Baylor\u2019s Incident Command Center.ADADPat Herlihy recalled transforming one of Baylor St. Luke\u2019s Medical Center\u2019s units in Houston into one that could receive coronavirus patients when he received the advice he needed.Herlihy got a call from a doctor at New York-Presbyterian/Columbia University Medical Center who had seen the worst of the novel coronavirus as it swamped New York\u2019s health-care system with tragic consequences.The first three words out of the New York doctor\u2019s mouth stuck with Herlihy: \u201cPrepare. Prepare. Prepare.\u201dThe reopening of the state worried public health officials who believed it was too fast, prompting medical directors to plan for a possible wave of cases.Texas doctors including Herlihy communicated in real time with colleagues elsewhere, scoured social media, studied YouTube videos from around the world and reviewed articles for anything that could help them get ready. The state and municipalities had time to streamline supply chains for personal protective equipment (PPE) and scale up staff numbers. State officials used their robust emergency management apparatus to deliver ventilators, medicine and test kits.ADADAbbott restricted elective surgeries to help conserve PPE, and he ordered health-care institutions to reserve beds for covid-19 patients. Doctors in New York passed on what they had learned then and now.\u201cIt was very important to communicate in real time because we were learning in real time,\u201d said David Greenwald, director of clinical gastroenterology and endoscopy at Mount Sinai in New York.\u201cWe are hearing from people in Texas,\u201d he said. \u201cAll of that information that we created in March, we memorialized and we have been offering all those resources back out.\u201dHealth-care workers in Texas have been trying to stay abreast of a flood of information on phone calls, Zoom lectures, in published papers and through medical societies.AD\u201cIt\u2019s impossible, impossible,\u201d said Carol Wu, a radiologist at the MD Anderson Cancer Center, describing the tsunami of research coming not only from hard-hit U.S. cities such as New York, but also from China, other Asian countries and Europe.ADIn Texas, many coronavirus patients are significantly younger and a higher proportion are Hispanic, said David Lakey, a former Texas health commissioner. The severity of their illness is not as great as those hospitalized in New York three months earlier, he said.Sam Bagchi, chief clinical officer at Christus Health, which has 30 hospitals in Texas including in Corpus Christi and San Antonio, said watching patients in other places have poor outcomes while on ventilators pushed Christus to try therapies that would keep patients off breathing machines or avoid them for as long as possible. The system cut its coronavirus mortality rate by more than half by May\u00a031. Even the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which provides guidance on public health functions like contact tracing and infection prevention, seemed behind the learning curve, he said.\u201cBecause the CDC has been so challenged, and maybe even politicized, at times we\u2019ve had to look beyond the CDC,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve moved things faster.\u201dADAt St. Luke\u2019s in Houston, Herlihy and his team paid close attention to their staffing needs to determine the right ratio for the volume of patients. They monitored their health-care workers for burnout and fatigue. They set up protocols when patients showed signs of renal failure and cardiac arrest. Each new promising treatment option \u2014 from steroids to remdesivir to convalescent plasma \u2014 were used in intensive care units.Hospitals normally update their protocols after medical journals publish the results of randomized clinical trials and expert groups provide recommendations. But the coronavirus has not allowed a great deal of time for that. Each week, medical chiefs are changing the strategy for how best to take care of their covid-19 patients.Herlihy recently came across international reports of a fungal infection, aspergillosis, found in covid-19 patients and adjusted protocols to get ahead of any fatal consequences.\u201cWhen this thing first happened, there was a lot of fear because it was new,\u201d Herlihy said. \u201cThree months later, we feel more confident. It\u2019s not new, and we know what it does.\u201dSt. Luke\u2019s  is pushing past capacity, shifting beds and making space for more covid-19 patients. The virus is unpredictable, but Herlihy said he is grateful Texas had some time to draw from the experiences of his colleagues to feel secure.\u201cWe have the attitude that failure is not an option,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\n\nLaurie McGinley contributed to this report.", "comment": "751 Comments", "topic": "National"}, {"cover": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ULOSRIVWLUI6VGQ52PNRZPQHZY.jpghttps://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ULOSRIVWLUI6VGQ52PNRZPQHZY.jpg", "title": "Trump is beating Biden on the most important factor in this campaign", "date": "Jul 1, 2020", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/07/01/trump-is-beating-biden-most-important-factor-this-campaign/", "keyword": "China and Security", "website": "the Washington Post", "author": "", "content": "Brad Parscale is the campaign manager of President Trump\u2019s reelection campaign.\u201cBush\u2019s Rating Falls To Its Lowest Point, New Survey Finds,\u201d read a bold headline on the front page of the New York Times on June 29, 2004.

But Trump is following through on his promises to the American people, and his reelection campaign is well positioned to spread his pro-growth economic agenda and contrast the president to 47-year career politician Joe Biden \u2014 who epitomizes the very system that has led to the current protests, and in many instances, civil unrest.ADADThe president\u2019s reelection war chest, including a record-setting $131 million raised in June from thousands of donors at all levels, reflects the continued support, enthusiasm and confidence so many Americans have in President Trump and his agenda. The massive amount raised in June eclipses the total raised in any single month of 2016.Read the latest edition of the 2020 Post Pundit Power RankingIn terms of turnout, the president\u2019s reelection effort has built the largest field program and data operation in Republican Party history, including 1.3 million volunteers trained and activated. The campaign has already made north of 45 million voter contacts, and efforts are growing stronger by the day.And when it comes to the most important factor, enthusiasm, President Trump is dominating. The unprecedented enthusiasm behind the president\u2019s reelection efforts stands in stark contrast to the flat, almost nonexistent enthusiasm for Biden.ADADPresident Trump experienced record-setting vote totals as the 2020 primary season kicked off. Despite the fact he is running essentially unopposed, voters are turning out in record numbers to voice their support for the president. In 23 of the 27 states that held primaries both now and in 2012, Trump outpaced then-President Barack Obama\u2019s vote by wide margins, even doubling Obama\u2019s numbers. President Trump\u2019s numbers have dwarfed not just Obama\u2019s, but Bush\u2019s as well. In Wisconsin in 2020, the president received more than 616,000 votes \u2014 compared with Obama\u2019s 293,914 and Bush\u2019s 158,933 votes received in 2004. In Georgia, the president hit almost 1 million primary votes this year, compared with Obama\u2019s 139,273 and Bush\u2019s 161,374. By contrast, Biden continues to struggle to even establish a base, let alone inspire it.\u201cThose who do not learn history are doomed to repeat it\u201d is a tired yet prescient phrase. Many mock the suggestion that President Trump is once again the outsider in 2020. \u201cHow can the incumbent president of the United States run as an outsider?\u201d goes the conventional wisdom. When your opponent has been a career politician in Washington for 47 years and is campaigning on a return to the former status quo, it\u2019s clear who the insider is and who remains the political outsider. Biden, like Hillary Clinton in 2016, is a career politician who has been a central part of the very Washington political system that voters opposed in 2016 and are doing so again.Biden\u2019s near half-century-long political career is littered with terrible policy decisions that have had disastrous effects on the American middle class over the past four decades.ADADIn 1994, he wrote one of the most devastating pieces of legislation in recent history \u2014 the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act that disproportionately put hundreds of thousands of young black men in prison.In 2001, he championed China\u2019s entry to the World Trade Organization \u2014 which enabled the loss of 60,000 U.S. factories.In 2002, he voted for the war in Iraq that cost thousands of American lives and trillions of dollars.Sign up for The Odds newsletter for election updates from data columnist David BylerEvery single one of those major decisions that make up Biden\u2019s legacy contributed to the electorate\u2019s pushback against the status quo. Trump understood the mood of the country and how both major political parties ignored the plight of the working man and woman of America.ADThe campaign has only just begun to define Biden and introduce the American electorate to who he really is: a 47-year career politician whose actions decimated American working families and betrayed black Americans.ADRead more:Read letters to the editor responding to this opinion pieceGreg Sargent: Biden just slammed Trump on a new and hidden vulnerabilityHugh Hewitt: Trump\u2019s sparse crowd in Tulsa means nothingGary Abernathy: Trump\u2019s imminent defeat is wishful thinking by his opponentsMarc A.

Subscribe today.arrow-rightAt the time, Hong Kong, known mostly as a financial center and tourism hub, was pretty much a news backwater. Then suddenly everything changed. The port city erupted in massive waves of pro-democracy protests. Frantic police were soon attacking not only the demonstrators, but also the reporters and local \u201ccitizen journalists\u201d supporting them. \u201cTwo weeks after I became president, the protests started,\u201d Schneider says. \u201cHong Kong itself [became] the story, and the FCC itself a player.\u201dThe turmoil steered the club into an unexpected political vortex and turned Schneider\u2019s easygoing gig into a delicate balancing contest with the increasingly harsh Beijing-backed authorities. Schneider and her board quickly released statements in support of a free Hong Kong press, which is guaranteed under the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d deal Britain extracted from Beijing when it relinquished control of the island in 1997. \u201cBut we thought, well, we want to go beyond that\u201d and directly engage the police, Schneider says.ADADIn October and again in early June, Schneider met with the Hong Kong police to express concerns about reporters being roughed up, arrested and prohibited from recording paramilitary \u201cdispersal operations.\u201d \u201cWe reminded them that press freedom is a right guaranteed under Hong Kong law, which the representatives acknowledged,\u201d the FCC said in a statement after the June meeting.The club also challenged authorities \u2014 who hold the lease on the club\u2019s building \u2014 by featuring pro-democracy voices at newsmaker luncheons and hosting videotaped panel discussions on topics such as how to defend press freedom and best practices against police tear gas and beatings. In an adroit move in November, however, Schneider also persuaded the club to invite C.Y. Leung, a former Beijing-backed chief executive of Hong Kong, to speak. As expected, he warned democracy advocates not to cross the \u201cred line\u201d of pressing for independence.Now Beijing has announced a new national security law that could equate criticism of the Communist Party with sedition, even treason, prompting the club to issue an open letter of \u201cconcern\u201d about its effect on journalists and press freedom. And that\u2019s on top of the coronavirus pandemic, which has added more misery to an economy already in deep recession from the political turmoil.For Schneider, who\u2019s a friend and former colleague, the virus was just another unexpected event in a year full of them. In late November, I met with her at the big oval bar of the club, which occupies an elegantly repurposed, high-ceilinged, multistoried former warehouse from British colonial days. She fielded greetings and traded wisecracks with the regulars as she joined me at a table against the back wall. She seemed unusually vibrant, perhaps because of the nearly unanimous praise she\u2019d earned for her stewardship of the club through difficult days.\u201cJodi has been an incredibly steady hand at the FCC during turbulent times,\u201d Keith Richburg, a former Washington Post Beijing bureau chief and onetime FCC president himself, told me. Now director of the Journalism and Media Studies Centre at the University of Hong Kong, Richburg credited Schneider with \u201cexactly the levelheaded, balanced approach and leadership we need, never wavering to defend press freedom while steering clear of histrionics.\u201dADADNearly everything that has happened in Hong Kong recently was unimaginable a year ago, much less when Schneider first caught the journalism bug at the University of Wisconsin at Madison in the early 1980s. Like many of her generation, she was inspired by The Washington Post's celebrated coverage of the Watergate scandal. As she raced through reporting jobs with newspapers in Colorado and Florida, the scoops piled up, eventually landing her a job as a local business editor at The Post. That was followed by more senior editing stints at U.S. News & World Report and then Congressional Quarterly, before she headed to Bloomberg, which eventually sent her to Tokyo and then Hong Kong.Even with the coronavirus pandemic, she has managed to keep the club open with temperature checks at the door and new socially distanced seating arrangements \u2014 the bar stools are gone, so no more elbow-to-elbow drinking as of old. In May she was reelected, unopposed, for a second term. Now, as she waits for the next wave of protests \u2014 and the possibility of Beijing\u2019s secret police rolling up dissidents for sham trials \u2014 she expects China to more closely monitor reporting and tighten controls over how many Western journalists can work in Hong Kong.Which would bring the club full circle to its ramshackle days during World War II in Chungking (now Chongqing), when it was less a club than a band of brothers in search of warm bunks, decent whiskey and straight answers from Chinese Nationalist leader Chiang Kai-shek. \u201cThe club moved with the action,\u201d hopscotching across treacherous battle zones and eventually landing in Shanghai, according to a history in the FCC\u2019s Correspondent magazine. In 1949, menaced by a communist \u201cfifth column\u201d in the city, the club retreated to the safety of British Hong Kong, where it \u201cgained a reputation for high living in boozy camaraderie that it has never lost,\u201d according to the affectionate 1999 BBC documentary \u201cOf All the Gin Joints.\u201dADADIn early June, I asked Schneider over the phone whether things were grim now, given the situation in the city. \u201cNot really,\u201d she said, chuckling. Reporters will be reporters. The same for the bankers, diplomats, public relations people and suspected spies who drop by for a beer or a meal. Downstairs, the famous Bert\u2019s jazz club has reopened, along with the gym, albeit with physical-distancing restrictions.\u201cIt\u2019s still kind of a port in the storm, a safe place,\u201d Schneider says of the club. And, she points out, with outgoing flights still virtually shut down because of the pandemic, \u201cno one can leave here. So this summer, the place is going to be packed.

But in the meantime, if a 15-year-old kid ran, I\u2019d vote for him,\u201d Frump told me in an interview, adding he doesn\u2019t like that Trump seems too willing to throw taxpayer dollars at problems instead of solving them. \u201cHe\u2019s not presidential stuff, and I thought he was because he thought a little differently, and I thought that\u2019s what we needed in the office.\u201dADADBut Frump \u2014 yes, his last name is just like \u201cTrump\u201d but with an \u201cF\u201d \u2014 doesn\u2019t know if he would go as far as to vote for Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee, who is much more liberal than Frump.\u201cI would be willing to bet that [Biden] would never make anybody mad like Trump does,\u201d Frump said. \u201cHe smiles at everything. He doesn\u2019t seem to think there\u2019s a problem anywhere, and he\u2019ll still be smiling when he\u2019s fighting it. That\u2019s a little too politics.\u201d\u00a0Warning signs: Sure, California will undoubtedly vote for the Democratic nominee no matter who Frump picks, but the retiree\u2019s concerns about the president\u2019s leadership and temperament are reflected in a series of national polls over the last several months revealing a major problem for President Trump\u2019s reelection campaign: He\u2019s losing the support of seniors, the country\u2019s most dedicated and reliable voters.\u00a0ADADTrump secured seniors by eight points in 2016 \u2014 and is now trailing Biden by five points on average in recent national polls, according to my colleagues Scott Clement and Emily Guskin.\u00a0Trump is also losing ground with white voters, including those without college degrees who were key to his 2016 victories in several states. \u201cAccording to new New York Times/Siena College polls, Trump is at least slightly behind Biden in six states that he won in 2016 and are pivotal to his reelection path \u2014 including Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, where he trails by double digits,\u201d my colleagues Ashley Parker, Robert Costa and Josh Dawsey reported this weekend.\u00a0Not so sunny: In Florida, where more than 20 percent of voters in 2016 were over the age of 65, Trump won the senior vote by a 17-point margin. A Quinnipiac poll in late April found 52 percent of Florida seniors supporting Biden to 42 percent for Trump, while a Fox News poll around the same time found Biden narrowly ahead. Democratic strategists say if Biden can win over roughly 10 percent of seniors who picked Trump in 2016, he could steal the state.\u00a0The Trump campaign has repeatedly brushed off suggestions it\u2019s struggling with seniors, even as Republicans across the country express alarm.\u00a0Trump recently tweeted a video showing a pro-Trump golf cart parade at The Villages, a heavily Republican Florida retirement community. Anti-Trump protesters lined the street, and the two sides screamed at one another in a stark visualization of the country's deep political divide. In the opening seconds, one man shouts at a woman wearing a \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d shirt and other protesters retort, \u2018White power!

Tim Scott (R-S.C.).The video is a reminder of how racism has long been central to Trump\u2019s campaign strategy, especially in galvanizing the support of older white conservative voters who are scared by the country\u2019s growing diversity and want to return to an earlier time, as Trump promises with his \u201cMake America Great Again\" slogan.Times they are a-changin: Back in May, I wrote an article about the senior vote in Florida, and I struggled to find wavering Trump voters like Frump who were unsure if they would vote for him again. I spoke with numerous Republicans or conservative-leaning independents who didn\u2019t vote for Trump in 2016 but couldn\u2019t bring themselves to vote for Hillary Clinton. Those voters are now likely to back Biden.Trump hasn\u2019t done much to win over these sorts of voters in recent months given the coronavirus pandemic and mass protests against racial injustice. In interviews with dozens of seniors across the country \u2014 mostly independents and former Republicans, but also some Republicans and Democrats \u2014 this is what worried them the most about the president:\u00a0ADADHis tweets: Every single person I interviewed, regardless of party, said Trump needs to stop tweeting, speak more purposefully and stop being so divisive. Several seniors noted they are around the president\u2019s age, 74, and would never act as he is acting. Many were particularly bothered by how Trump continues to fan the flames of racial tension in the country. A conservative retiree living in rural central Pennsylvania said he left the Republican Party in 2016 because it felt stuck in time when it comes to civil rights and the environment \u2014 and Trump has proven he made the right decision.\u00a0His coronavirus messaging: Most seniors said they were urged by their doctors \u2014 and, more often, their children and grandchildren \u2014 \u00a0not to leave the house during the pandemic unless necessary and to always wear a mask if they do. They listened and are frustrated Trump isn't conveying a similar message. One devout Trump supporter in Florida, who said only God could stop the pandemic, said she doesn\u2019t leave her house without a mask, as that would be like \u201cdriving with your eyes shut.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0His economic boosterism: When asked about reopening the economy during the pandemic, these seniors rarely talked about themselves \u2014 as most say they will continue to stay home until there\u2019s a vaccine. They instead shared their worries about grown children or grandchildren who have lost their jobs, had their pay slashed or are being rushed back to work in unsafe conditions. In Florida, seniors who worked part-time jobs say they\u2019ve struggled to receive unemployment benefits.\u00a0His bashing of mail-in voting: Most of these seniors said they plan to vote-by-mail this fall rather than possibly expose themselves to the virus by standing in line for hours to cast a ballot in person. Trump is firmly opposed to expanding ballot access through the mail, even though seniors \u2014 including those who support him \u2014 would benefit greatly. It\u2019s almost as if he\u2019s giving these voters an excuse to stay home.\u00a0Voting for Trump or against Trump: Several politically independent seniors spoke about this election and their options for this fall strictly in terms of Trump, rarely if ever mentioning Biden. They very much see 2020 as a referendum on the president, more so than an endorsement of Biden or his vision for the nation.\u00a0Peer pressure: One of the seniors I interviewed in May was a retiree living in northeastern Florida who did not want his name published because his golf buddies are Trump supporters, and he didn\u2019t want them to know his political leanings. After the article ran, he emailed me to say one of those buddies read the article and could tell it was him.\u201cHe needled me a bit in good humor,\u201d the email read, \u201cand when I expressed my shock that he would read The Washington Post, he said, \u2018I don't have the same views as most of these guys we play with!\u2019\"Outside the BeltwayABOUT (THE PRIMARIES) LAST NIGHT: Former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper (D) easily dispatched his primary foe after concerns his shaky performance in the contest so far might have left an opening.

But in the meantime, if a 15-year-old kid ran, I\u2019d vote for him,\u201d Frump told me in an interview, adding he doesn\u2019t like that Trump seems too willing to throw taxpayer dollars at problems instead of solving them. \u201cHe\u2019s not presidential stuff, and I thought he was because he thought a little differently, and I thought that\u2019s what we needed in the office.\u201dADADBut Frump \u2014 yes, his last name is just like \u201cTrump\u201d but with an \u201cF\u201d \u2014 doesn\u2019t know if he would go as far as to vote for Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee, who is much more liberal than Frump.\u201cI would be willing to bet that [Biden] would never make anybody mad like Trump does,\u201d Frump said. \u201cHe smiles at everything. He doesn\u2019t seem to think there\u2019s a problem anywhere, and he\u2019ll still be smiling when he\u2019s fighting it. That\u2019s a little too politics.\u201d\u00a0Warning signs: Sure, California will undoubtedly vote for the Democratic nominee no matter who Frump picks, but the retiree\u2019s concerns about the president\u2019s leadership and temperament are reflected in a series of national polls over the last several months revealing a major problem for President Trump\u2019s reelection campaign: He\u2019s losing the support of seniors, the country\u2019s most dedicated and reliable voters.\u00a0ADADTrump secured seniors by eight points in 2016 \u2014 and is now trailing Biden by five points on average in recent national polls, according to my colleagues Scott Clement and Emily Guskin.\u00a0Trump is also losing ground with white voters, including those without college degrees who were key to his 2016 victories in several states. \u201cAccording to new New York Times/Siena College polls, Trump is at least slightly behind Biden in six states that he won in 2016 and are pivotal to his reelection path \u2014 including Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, where he trails by double digits,\u201d my colleagues Ashley Parker, Robert Costa and Josh Dawsey reported this weekend.\u00a0Not so sunny: In Florida, where more than 20 percent of voters in 2016 were over the age of 65, Trump won the senior vote by a 17-point margin. A Quinnipiac poll in late April found 52 percent of Florida seniors supporting Biden to 42 percent for Trump, while a Fox News poll around the same time found Biden narrowly ahead. Democratic strategists say if Biden can win over roughly 10 percent of seniors who picked Trump in 2016, he could steal the state.\u00a0The Trump campaign has repeatedly brushed off suggestions it\u2019s struggling with seniors, even as Republicans across the country express alarm.\u00a0Trump recently tweeted a video showing a pro-Trump golf cart parade at The Villages, a heavily Republican Florida retirement community. Anti-Trump protesters lined the street, and the two sides screamed at one another in a stark visualization of the country's deep political divide. In the opening seconds, one man shouts at a woman wearing a \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d shirt and other protesters retort, \u2018White power! White power!\u201d Trump later deleted the video after prompting from advisers and Sen.
