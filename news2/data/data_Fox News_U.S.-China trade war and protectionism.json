So, I'm confident, we've had private\u00a0conversations as well, we will proceed in a\u00a0way that makes clear, it's not\u00a0OK to use your diplomats to engage\u00a0in industrial espionage, it's\u00a0not OK to steal intellectual property [or] engage in\u00a0those\u00a0kinds of behaviors.\u00a0That's the reason we did it: We\u00a0did it to protect the American\u00a0people.\"The host added that China reportedly threatened retaliation in the form of potentially closing U.S. outposts in Chengdu and/or Wuhan, pressing Pompeo as to whether that might come to pass.\"Let's go back to first\u00a0principles: ... for\u00a040 plus years --\u00a0this is why I am\u00a0at the Nixon Library today --\u00a0America has turned\u00a0the other cheek while we watched\u00a0the Chinese Communist Party\u00a0engage in activity that's not\u00a0fair to the American people,\u00a0it's not reciprocal for the\u00a0American people, and it doesn't\u00a0have the transparency we need so\u00a0we can engage with China in a\u00a0way that's fair for our people\u00a0and provide security for our\u00a0people, that's what we are\u00a0aiming to do,\" Pompeo responded. \"This decision about the [Houston] consulate is consistent with a\u00a0whole bunch of other actions\u00a0that we've taken and a whole\u00a0bunch more that we are going to\u00a0continue to do until we get the\u00a0change.\"MacCallum later considered whether the actions involving the Houston consulate, combined with other actions on both sides of the Pacific have brought upon that same atmosphere that Washington once had in its relationship with the Kremlin.\"We talk about\u00a0sanctions that we have, there\u00a0are military exercises that have\u00a0become somewhat more prominent in the\u00a0region,  that\u00a0just received indictments, are\u00a0we in a Cold War right now with\u00a0China?\" she asked. \"If we are not, it certainly\u00a0looks like we are.\"Pompeo said that China continues to leave a trail of broken promises involving things \"central to how great power-nations behave.\"He said that Chinese President Xi Jinping promised the Obama administration he would not militarize the South China Sea, and also that the Chinese had made a pact with Great Britain in 1999 involving the 50-year relative autonomy of Hong Kong.\"He busted it -- he broke it.\u00a0The United States is simply demanding that if the Chinese Communist Party wants to be\u00a0considered in the league of\u00a0nations that have great\u00a0power and great roles and great\u00a0importance, they have to behave\u00a0according to promises that they\u00a0make -- and the rules that have been\u00a0set out for sovereign nations to\u00a0preserve freedom for their own\u00a0people, that's what we are\u00a0seeking to see happen,\" Pompeo said.\"Label it what you must but\u00a0President Trump understands that previous administrations -- both\u00a0Republican and Democrat alike -- to turn\u00a0the other cheek for an awfully\u00a0long time and it resulted in a\u00a0real imbalance in the\u00a0relationship between the\u00a0United States and China -- and we aim\u00a0to fix it.\".", "comment": "(66)", "topic": "Fox News Flash", "date": " July 23"}, {"cover": "https://a57.foxnews.com/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/694940094001/e94a9056-6b9a-46e7-944d-8132a3f2465d/b0302298-cf46-4d39-b6f9-892d952e9f10/1280x720/match/156/88/image.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "title": "Pompeo on importance of protecting Americans from Chinese espionage", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/transcript/pompeo-on-importance-of-protecting-americans-from-chinese-espionage", "subtitle": "Guests: Mike Pompeo, K.T.

I'm Martha MacCallum in New York. And this is a fast-moving \"Story\" tonight. A lot of breaking news for you this evening.And a rapidly changing landscape for the 2020 election. The President canceled the Jacksonville portion of the Republican National Convention when he came out to speak to the press today.Also, we've got some brand new polling numbers for you from Fox polling that show that the President trails Joe Biden in the battleground states of Michigan, Minnesota and Pennsylvania, as we are about 100 days out from the election.Mr. Trump was in a similar position, though, we should point out back in 2016, and after his very surprising victory that year there was a lot of talk in the country about who these voters in this silent majority in America could be? Watch this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Trump voters were long-suffering; analysts say often silenced.GREG MYTROSEVICH, OHIO TRUMP VOTER: A lot of people kept quiet about a lot of things.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: So you don't say it in the polls, you don't say it to anybody else, but you show up and in the voting booth you go Trump.JOHN BRABENDER, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST: They're not answering the phone and telling people publicly they're voting for Donald Trump.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: Could some new numbers tonight from the libertarian think tank, the Cato Institute suggests that Americans are still, in fact even more so now, keeping their politics to themselves. Look at these numbers. 62 percent say that today's climate prevents them from talking about what they believe with anybody. By a large margin, those who identify, though, as very liberal. This is the group who feels the most free to speak out among friends, family, whatever, about their politics.So what exactly does this tell us about the state of the 2020 race? And what is America's growing frustration with cancel culture as an adjunct to that tell us? Marc Thiessen and Marie Harf are here to debate tonight.Also, as Bret mentioned, my exclusive interview this evening with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who just delivered a blistering message to China's communist leadership, calling on the Chinese people to perhaps consider a different path than the communist government that leads them. We're going to break that down and talk to him about exactly what he said about that.That, as China says they are not going to leave the embassy in Houston. We will get for the first time the Secretary of State to respond to them, digging in their heels at that embassy in moments.Then after that, K.T. McFarland is here with her analysis of the Pompeo interview. What's - are we in a cold war with China now? Is China been a failed experiment since 1979? All that with Katie.But we start tonight with Marc Thiessen, American Enterprise Institute Scholar and Marie Harf, Executive Director of Serve America PAC. Both are Fox News Contributors. Great to have both of you here tonight, Marie and Marc.It strikes me every time we have anyone on from the Trump campaign, we show them the latest numbers. Tonight we just showed everybody the latest numbers from Michigan, Minnesota and Pennsylvania. And they always say, look, we don't care. The polls aren't right. There's a lot of secret Trump voters out there, which we saw in a Monmouth poll last week in Pennsylvania. But Marc, it makes it very difficult to gauge where the country is at right now.MARC THIESSEN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Yes. Well, they probably overstated, especially these new Fox News polls show a big gap. It's probably not as big a gap as the polls show. So I don't think Democrats should get too excited about it.But I think that - and questionably there are secret Trump voters. In fact, there was a poll - Monmouth poll in Pennsylvania, that 57 percent of the voters there were pretty sure that some of their neighbors were planning to vote for Trump, but weren't saying it.And there's a reason for that. There's the cancel culture as it has taken hold in a way it has in recent months. I mean, think about this. Is it more or less hospitable environment for a Trump supporter to express their support for the president now than it was four months ago? I think not. So, I think that - I think there are a lot of people who won't tell a pollster that they're supporting Trump and - but are really going to vote for him in the ballot box.MACCALLUM: I think it's fascinating. And when you look at that number, 62 percent say that they do not want to share their political feelings with anybody. And back in 2017, three years ago, that number was at 58 percent. So we've seen increase, Marie, in the people in the country who are just saying, I'm not going to talk about it. I'm keeping my decision to myself.MARIE HARF, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Yes, Martha. And every Democrat, I know is running like Joe Biden is 10 points behind for this exact reason. People were very confident in 2016 that Hillary Clinton would win. We know there was a hidden Trump voter then in many of these swing states that the Fox News poll spoke to today like Michigan or Pennsylvania, where Donald Trump won by very little in 2016.So Democrats are worried about this. They really want to act like they're running from behind. I think these numbers do concern the Trump team, though. And I also think it's a really polarized time in our country. I mean, there are people on the other side of the aisle who've told me that Democrats hate America, and they hate Christianity. And that kind of language, even four or five years ago wasn't really out there. So our country is really deeply divided. We see that every day and it's a real problem. I don't know how to fix it. There's no easy answer.MACCALLUM: Yes. I want you to take a look at some of these other numbers, because they are disturbing. I mean, let's pull up this one. 32 percent worry about their jobs, because if their political opinions become known, they're concerned that they could lose their job.Look at this next one. Do you think it's OK to fire someone who supports Trump or Biden? In other words, if at your job it became known that you had given money to Joe Biden or who had given money to Trump, they support firing you. 50 percent of those who consider themselves very liberal, Marc - I mean, just think about this. So they support - they think that person should be fired from their company, that's a very disturbing number.THIESSEN: Well, it's insane and the reality is--MACCALLUM: I don't know what country--THIESSEN: --that it just show how polarized our country has become. But let's keep in mind - that I agree with Marie that there are some Republicans who say things that are overwrought about Democrats like saying that they don't love America. I condemn that.But the reality is, if you look at that poll, Republicans are more worried - there are more Republicans who are worried about expressing their views than Democrats by 25-point margin. The only group that feels that it's - that has - a majority feel confident about it, saying what they what they believe are staunch liberals.And the reason for that is, because there really isn't a penalty for being a liberal or for expressing staunch liberal views. You're not going to get in trouble at work for saying Black Lives Matter. You will get in trouble for saying blue lives matter. There will be repercussions for that. So I think there is - this cancel culture is going after the Right in a way that it's not over the Left. And we should condemn it whether it goes after conservatives or liberals.MACCALLUM: Yes. I also thought that deeper in that number, the 62 percent, who say that they don't feel comfortable talking about who they support politically, 59 percent of independents said that. So - I mean, these are the people who elect presidents and we don't know, which side they're on when you look at that number. But 59 percent of independents, Marie, said that they did not want to discuss who they will vote for or who they support.HARF: Yes, these numbers are really interesting, and I agree, disturbing in many ways. And Donald Trump as an election strategy hasn't gone after independents. He's really tripled down on his base. We've seen that with his rhetoric and his policies. And so, I don't know where those independents will break.In the polling we've seen from Fox and others, they're breaking towards Democrats and they certainly broke towards Democrats in 2018.MACCALLUM: That's interesting.HARF: But cancel culture is on both sides. Right? Like I'm not on Twitter--MACCALLUM: Is it?HARF: --because I was bullied off of it by conservatives. So it's on both sides and it's not good wherever it is.MACCALLUM: Yes.THIESSEN: Get back on Twitter, Marie, no one should believe you. I won't stand for it.MACCALLUM: It's disgusting what happens these days there.HARF: Thank you.MACCALLUM: Thank you very much, guys. Marie, Marc, great to have you. Lots more to talk to you about, but we'll pick it up next time. Thank you for being here tonight.So China digs in its heels now. This is a reflection of the burning of documents at that consulate in Houston. Now they say they're not going to leave the United States. So we asked Secretary of State Pompeo what he plans to do about that? Next.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MIKE POMPEO, SECRETARY OF STATE: Securing our freedoms from the Chinese Communist Party is the mission of our time, and America is perfectly positioned to lead it because our founding principles give us that opportunity.(END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)MACCALLUM: Are China and United States at a crossroads that could lead us into another Cold War? Perhaps even a Cold War decade. In a speech today at the Nixon Library, Secretary Pompeo said this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)POMPEO: The CCP fears the Chinese people's honest opinions more than any foe, and save for losing their own grip on power, they have reason - no reason to.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: That as China's General Consul in Houston tells POLITICO today in an interview that they do not plan to leave their Houston consulate.Here now exclusively to respond to that and lots of other things today is Secretary of State. Mike Pompeo. Mr. Secretary, thank you very much for speaking with us today.POMPEO: Martha, it's great to be with you. Thanks for having me on.MACCALLUM: Thank you. So let's start there. The consul in Houston says that they do not have plans to leave that consulate right now. What's your response to that?POMPEO: While everyone knows the rules for diplomats. You're only permitted to be there in a diplomatic status with the consent of the host nation. And so, I'm confident, we've had private conversations as well.I'm very confident that we'll proceed in a way that makes clear that it's not OK to use your diplomats to engage in industrial espionage. It's not OK to steal intellectual property. It's not OK to engage in those kind of behaviors. That's the reason we did it. We did it to protect the American people. And we're going to make sure that that happens.MACCALLUM: I guess, the question - they say that you're - that United States is abandoning the Vienna Convention and also violating the China- U.S. consular treaty. You, obviously, think that they've already violated both of those. But literally, physically, what if they say, we will not leave, what will the United States do?POMPEO: Yes. Martha, I'm not going to speculate. We're going to make sure that we protect the American people. President Trump began to talk about this threat back in 2015 in this campaign, and you're seeing his administration begin to do the things that will lead to make sure that the American people are safe and secure.And that the jobs that depend on American intellectual property aren't lost to theft from Chinese diplomats that sit in a place in Houston, Texas with great access to American scientific knowhow and business value.MACCALLUM: There is discussion that China may retaliate by asking us to leave one of the six embassies that we have in China. We also have one in Hong Kong. And it looks like Chengdu and potentially Wuhan are at the top of that list. Will we be vacating any of our embassies in China, Mr. Secretary?POMPEO: Martha, let's go back to first principles. The first principles are this, for 40 plus years now - and this is why I'm at the Nixon Library today. For 40 plus years, America has turned the other cheek while we've watched the Chinese Communist Party engage in activity that's fundamentally not fair to the American people, it's not reciprocal for the American people and it doesn't have the transparency we need, so that we can engage with China in a way that's fair for our people and provide security for people. That's what we're aiming to do.And so this decision about the consulate that was made is consistent with all - whole bunch of other actions that we have already taken. A whole bunch more that we're going to continue to do until we get the change.I talked about President Nixon saying that the important thing was that we could induce change from China. That's the mission set the President Trump has set our course on. So whether it is the indictments that have been handed down by the Department of Justice, or the decisions we've made with respect to Hong Kong.All of those are aimed at inducing change inside the Chinese Communist Party for the simple purpose of protecting the American people. And so the Chinese government will get to make its decisions about our diplomats their inside of China. We will make sure that we do right by the American people.MACCALLUM: So, I mean, it sounds like you're saying that this is a very ruptured relationship. And, if I'm reading too much in to take from that, but it - we may, yes, we may pull out of embassies in China that might be part of this process.POMPEO: Yes, Martha I talked today about actions, not words. I was in Honolulu, just a few weeks back. I met with Yang Jiechi. We had a wonderful discussion. But in the end, what matters are actions, the things that make sure that we protect the American people. President Trump's trade deal was a good first effort. That the Phase 1 trade deal is important. If we get that right, that'd be the beginning of a basis for us to expand a fair and reciprocal set of trading relationships.But look at our diplomatic relationship today. They have many more diplomats here in the United States than we have inside of China. And their diplomats here in the United States have much more freedom of movement, and much more access that our diplomats do in China - inside of China.MACCALLUM: Yes.POMPEO: All we're asking, Martha, all we're asking is we want it to be fair and reciprocal. And that's the aim of President Trump. It's what we're going to accomplish.MACCALLUM: So you talked about the sanctions that we have, there's military exercises that have also become somewhat more prominent in the region. We have two hackers that just received indictments. Are we in a Cold War right now with China? And if we're not, it certainly looks like we are.POMPEO: General Secretary Xi has clearly taken actions that are aggressive and broken promises that are central to how great power nations behave. Remember he made a promise back in 2015 in the Rose Garden with President Obama. He said he wouldn't militarize the South China Sea. You can go look, there's now significant military activity there by China.He made a promise to the people of Britain, to the people of Hong Kong that they would have a 50-year deal of one country two systems. He busted it. He broke it. United States is simply demanding that if the Chinese Communist Party wants to be considered in the League of Nations that have great power and great roles and great importance, they've got to behave according to promises that they make and the rules that have been set out for sovereign nations to preserve freedom for their own people.That's what we're seeking to see happen. Label it what you must. But President Trump understands that the previous administrations, both Republican and Democrat alike, turned the other cheek for an awfully long time.MACCALLUM: Yes.POMPEO: And resulted in a real imbalance in the relationship between the United States and China. We aim to fix it.MACCALLUM: I spoke to trade advisor Peter Navarro on this program several weeks back. And I said is the trade deal basically over? And he said, yes, it is. He walked that back a bit. But, it appears that it is. Is that fair to say at this point?POMPEO: No, I'm hopeful that the Phase 1 trade deal we've complied with by both sides. The Chinese Communist Party tells us that they're going to fulfill their commitments. We have every expectation that they will, and our task will be to verify that they've done so. We hope that they do. And if they do, perhaps there'll be an opportunity to build on that.And what we're not going to let happen is what we've allowed to happen before, is that they make a set of promises, they make a commitment, like the Phase 1 trade deal and then they try and they do a little bit and America calls it good enough. President Trump is not going to permit that to happen. We're going to hold them accountable for the promises that they make, MarthaMACCALLUM: President Trump just said moments ago, that that trade deal is not as important to him anymore as it once was.POMPEO: I understand that. I completely understand it. When you see what the Chinese Communist Party has done to our country and to the world with their failure to live up to another set of promises they made to the world about their responsibility if a pandemic began to break out of their country, the cover up that took place. You can absolutely understand why a trade deal like the Phase 1 trade deal no longer ranks first among all the various issues we have with the Chinese Communist Party.MACCALLUM: Yes.POMPEO: We've seen across the world, hundreds of thousands of deaths. Trillions of dollars in economic destruction wrought on this world, because the Chinese Communist Party failed to live up to some basic commitments to the world.MACCALLUM: You made a very strong appeal to the Chinese people in this speech, basically calling on them to call for a new form of government in China. Are you encouraging them towards regime change? And you said that we would encourage and empower - engage and empower. How will we do that? What - how do we play that role? What will that look like?POMPEO: Martha, I talked about several things. One of which is there are 1.4 billion Chinese people. And what I wanted to make clear in my remarks today is we want good things for them. They've raised hundreds of millions of people out of destitute, poverty, we think that's a good thing. We're not trying to contain the prosperity for the people of China. We're simply trying to preserve freedom for the people of the United States of America. That is the American task.President Trump, when he was sworn in, and I - when I was sworn in as Secretary of State, that's the promise that we made. And so what we are concerned about is not holding China down, but making sure that we all get this right, so that we can have a prosperous economy here in the United States of America, and that we can hold them accountable in ways that preserve and secure freedom for the American people. That's the mission.So when I talk about the Chinese people, I'm talking about making sure that they have the opportunity to participate on a fair and reciprocal basis, in the same way that we expect the American people will.MACCALLUM: I guess - but if I'm the government of China listening to what you're saying, it sounds like you are encouraging the people of China to rise up, to create a different - to push for a different form of government. And we see what's happening in Taiwan where they have a genuine fear that they might be invaded or attacked by the Mainland.You look at what's happening in Hong Kong, where they are experiencing a diminishment all the time of their independence. So those are very provocative words to the Chinese government to say we want your people to push for a new form of government.MACCALLUM: Martha, that's not what I said. Go back and reread what I talked about. This was a speech about the American perspective and the need for a global alliance of freedom loving nations. This is what we're demanding.We know that the Chinese Communist Party has a different system. They still have obligations to live up to promises, promises even that they make to their own people. Our task is to preserve freedom and security for our people. And we know we need partners to do that. We know we need friends.I was in London and Copenhagen just the last two days, talking to them about this. The whole world is beginning to see that when you bend the knee to China, that bad things happen to your own country. So I have every expectation what the whole world, indeed freedom loving people all around the world must demand that the Chinese Communist Party live up to the commitments that it makes.MACCALLUM: You talked a moment ago about - your obvious concerns about this virus and the origins of this virus. Today in the United States we passed 4 million cases, which is obviously a milestone that is difficult for everybody to hear. Nancy Pelosi, the Speaker of the House said that the President calls it the China virus. She said that she is calling it the Trump virus as a result of the President's handling of this virus. What do you say to that, sir?POMPEO: One ought not to make a virus that has had such devastation in United States a political matter. What one ought to do is to call out the people and places that resulted in this virus getting out of Wuhan, China. There's no mistake. There's lots to dispute about the precise origin of this virus. We'd love to know the answers to that. But sadly, the Chinese Communist Party has prevented that.But we know it came from Wuhan. We know they closed down Hubei Province, but didn't close down traveled to the rest of the world. That has caused enormous harm to the United States of America. So this is indeed a china virus. It emanated from there. Make no mistake about it. It is not political. It is factual.MACCALLUM: Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, thank you very much. Good to have you with us this evening. Thank you for your time, sir.POMPEO: Martha. Thank you.MACCALLUM: Former Deputy National Security Advisor K.T. McFarland on where all of this is leading the United States and China. Next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)MACCALLUM: Strong word tonight from Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. He says essentially, Richard Nixon was right when he wrote in 1967 that the world cannot be safe until China changes. And now the United States faces that turning point once again, here he is moments ago.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)POMPEO: --talked about President Nixon saying that the important thing was that we could induce change from China. That's the mission set the President Trump has set our course on. So whether it is the indictments that have been handed down by the Department of Justice, or the decisions we've made with respect to Hong Kong.All of those are aimed at inducing change inside the Chinese Communist Party for the simple purpose of protecting the American people.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: Former deputy national security advisor for the Trump administration. K.T. McFarland joins me now. She's the author of Revolution: Trump, Washington, and We, the People.\" K.T., good to see you tonight. Your thoughts on with the secretary of state had to say there.K.T. MCFARLAND, AUTHOR, \"REVOLUTION\": You know, this is a really significant interview you just had with him and it's a really significant event. And here's why it's important.Forty-nine years ago this month, Richard Nixon, President Nixon directed his national security advisor to go to China and open up relations with China, to bring China into the world.I was a young staff aide to Richard Nixon and Henry Kissinger at that time. I remember this as if it was yesterday.And that set American foreign policy with China in a certain direction for 50 years. And President Nixon was right. He said we will induce them to change. Our thoughts, Republican and Democrat alike was that as China modernizes, as China comes into the world, as they develop a middle class, they will be an open society, an open economy, an open society, but that's not how it turned out.The Chinese in fact have exploited that. And that's why Pompeo was at the Nixon Library today, because he is indicating we now have a reverse. We are now -- we are now acknowledging the fact that the Chinese have stolen intellectual property rights, have militarized the South China Sea, have unleashed a bio weapon onto the world, have practiced wolf diplomacy and so, we, the Trump administration with the United States we're going to have a very different approach to China going forward and that's exactly what he was telling you.And, Martha, I also thought it was interesting when he mentioned to you that he was in Copenhagen, he was in London.MACCALLUM: Yes.MCFARLAND: And he was talking to America's allies about getting the coalition together so we together stand up to China.MACCALLUM: And what does China's coalition look like?MCFARLAND: China has never had very many allies. I mean, their vision of the world and the world that they really want to impose on the rest of us is China is the superpower, China is going to be, they think, the world's major economic political, military, diplomatic power. And then China will determine what everybody else does.And you step out of line for a minute, you try to -- you try to challenge China, you try to go against China and you get crushed. The Australians, for example, the Australians had the temerity to say let's just investigate what happens with the pandemic, with the coronavirus and China turned around and tried to crush their exports, their barley and wheat exports to China. China has, they play with really elbows out sharp. There is President Trump says they are ruthless in their negotiations.MACCALLUM: Yes. Well, I mean, they've essentially someone say they've been buying friends in Latin America, in Asia, in Africa, we know helping with aid and all of that. So, it will be interesting to see if there is a cold war period that we are entering how everything lines up.Secretary Pompeo said we must engage and empower the Chinese people. And he was very careful to say that he is not calling for regime change in China, and yet, you can see these seeds of rebellion in Hong Kong wanting to stay independent, and in Taiwan saying to the rest the world, you know wake up.MCFARLAND: Yes.MACCALLUM: You know, we could be invaded.MCFARLAND: Yes. And I thought that was also really significant what he told you, because he was sort of talking about regime change but he really wasn't talking about regime change.I think that the pandemic, Hong Kong, the South China Sea, these has been a slap in the face in the world and I think it's a wake-up call to the rest of the world. And so, we are not criticizing China, the Chinese people. We are criticizing the Chinese Communist Party which runs China right now which is accumulated more and more power and is a dictatorship, really of President Xi Jinping who is now going to be president for life of China.MACCALLUM: It's fascinating to watch. And it reminds me so much of the Cold War with Russia, we're even in the space race.MCFARLAND: Yes.MACCALLUM: This time it's to Mars, the Chinese against the United States.So, K.T., thank you very much.MCFARLAND: There you have it.MACCALLUM: Great to see you as always.MCFARLAND: Thank you, Martha. Thank you.MACCALLUM: So, the CDC has just released new guidance on how to reopen our schools saying that COVID-19 poses low risk to school age children echoing the sentiment of President Trump today. We are going to talk to a panel of educators with decades of teaching experience about what they think this should look like when we come back.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Fortunately, the data shows that children are at lower risk from the China virus very substantially. When children do contract the virus, they often have only very mild symptoms or none at all.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: Fox News alert tonight. The CDC has just released their guidance for reopening schools this fall. The headline according to the CDC, this virus poses, quote, \"low risks to students and teachers,\" therefore face masks and social distancing are the best defense.Quote, \"the best available evidence from countries that have opened schools indicates that COVID-19 poses low risk to school age children. Reopening schools creates opportunity to invest in the education, well-being and future of one of America's greatest assets, our children, while taking every precaution to protect students, teachers, staff, and all their families.\"Tonight, we are joined by three teachers, all with different opinions about whether students can safely return to the classroom. Leigha Phillips teaches high school English, Krista Herrin teaches kindergarten and first grade special education, and Phil Strunk teaches middle school social studies.Great to have all of you with us today.Krista, let me start with you, teaching kindergartners, how do you feel about the fact that, you know, they say some very young children don't even need to do the mask part necessarily?KRISTA HERRIN, KINDERGARTEN & FIRST GRADE TEACHER: I have a lot of concerns going into the school year. Kindergartners love to share, they love to share toys, they love to share hugs and they love to share germs. And I think it's going to be really difficult for us to keep masks on kids and social distance in a small classroom. I don't have any windows in my room, so I'm just pretty nervous about how things are going to go this school year.MACCALLUM: So, how do you feel though about the statistics that show that it's -- you know, the transmission is very low among children and that the risk according to what we see in other countries appears to be very low in terms of -- even studies that have been done that show that their transmission to other people appears to be very low, that doesn't reassure you?HERRIN: It's reassuring but at the same time, here in the United States, we shut down before we had any chance to spread germs in the school. So that's my big concern is, we don't know. I mean, there are other countries that are showing that, but I just worry when we get closer to the fall and the winter with more illness, that we are going to see a lot more illness.MACCALLUM: Phil, what do you think about those guidelines?PHIL STRUNK, MIDDLE SCHOOL TEACHER: Regarding the guidelines whenever I look at them, I am, you know, it's comforting to see that students under age 10 we're not really seeing a high transmission but it's the number for students over age 10.The New York Times came out with an article that said we're spreading it -- or sorry -- 10-year-olds are spreading it at about the same age as adults. We are working in schools now where like the state of Pennsylvania, that a nurse to student ratio is 1500 to one. That guideline was set back in the 40s. In my home state of Virginia, it's over 800 to one. And the CDC guidelines are 750 to one.MACCALLUM: Yes.STRUNK: We're not exactly set right now to be able to combat this whole currently uncurable virus.MACCALLUM: But Phil, let me ask you this. Because, you know, looking at a chart here that shows the flu deaths in the country. So right now, we're at 30 children under 15. Thirty children under 15 have died, most of them had complicating factors and obviously no one wants to see any child die from any disease in this country.STRUNK: Sure.MACCALLUM: If we can prevent it we of course want to do everything we can. However, the average over the past 10 years of children who died because of the flu every year is 511. And we do not shut schools down from, you know, November to January every year because of the flu.STRUNK: Right. You're absolutely right, we don't shut it down during the flu. One of my big concerns right now is students passing it on to educators like myself. I'm coming home to a wife and we are expecting our first child this November.The CDC has also pointed out that women that are in their third trimester of pregnancy are at huge risk and that's where she's going to be. I think of teachers that have taught with that are overcoming cancer and a lot of other illnesses. And for me, you know, I want the economy open just like everybody else, I want to eat meals with my friends. I want to be able to stand next to a student whenever they're struggling with something.I don't think you're going to find any teachers who are going to say I don't want to be back in school. But for me, my value on human life is much higher than the need to currently open up the education system in an in-person format. Schools didn't close last spring, you know, teachers continue to work tirelessly.MACCALLUM: Yes.STRUNK: And we'll continue to work tirelessly this fall.MACCALLUM: Leigha, what do you think?LEIGHA PHILLIPS, HIGH SCHOOL ENGLISH TEACHER: I mean, I agree with a lot of what they are saying especially if I were working with the young kids, I'd be concerned. I've got a nine, four, and 2-year-old, and I know that keeping their hands to themselves and keeping masks on can be hard so I really empathize especially with our elementary school teachers, middle schoolers aren't much different in all honesty.Just like Phil said, I am worried about my high school kids transmitting it whether it's between themselves, giving it to me and me taking at home, me giving it to my elderly grandma. So, I would love to be in school and I would love to see a hybrid work but that takes a lot of work and a lot of resources that not all districts have and are able to do in such a short time.MACCALLUM: I mean, we've had, you know, the whole summer, or really since March to be adapting to this, there's been hundreds of millions of dollars that went out in the CARE Act to help schools get ready for this and prepare.One of the things that President Trump said had to do with, you know, reallocating money if the schools choose not to open in the face of these guidelines, here's what he said about that.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: If schools are not reopened, the funding should go to parents to send their child to public-private, charter, religious, or homeschool of their choice.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: So, Krista, some schools will open, should parents have the option to use the tax dollars that are allocated to their child to send them someplace else that is open if they want them in school?HERRIN: I think that it's a parent's choice as to where they want their child to go and what they feel would be the best for their family. But I know that more public educators they want the best for what their student needs and they want them to be safe. And so, no matter what the outcome is, the community needs to come together and support the teachers that are trying to do their best.MACCALLUM: What about remote learning, Phil? We've heard a lot that over all, especially for children in urban environments, in inner-city environments, that remote learning has been a failure.STRUNK: Yes, remote learning is going to be challenging no matter what, and I think the other teachers on this panel would agree with me whenever I'd say none of us would suggest remote learning or anything like that because it's easier or better for students, we all know being in a classroom with kids is what's the best option.MACCALLUM: Yes.STRUNK: But again, we're facing an unprecedented time with this pandemic that's killing thousands of people. At this point, I think in the interest of safety, that kind of has to take the top priority, that way we can bring more students back into the classroom in the safe format.MACCALLUM: What about, Leigha, before I let you go, quickly if you can, you know, these studies that show that kids are actually they are in more danger in school than they are staying home. There's instances of abuse, there's difficulties at home, there are things that you don't pick up on necessarily if you don't get to see that child in school every day, does that danger outweigh the virus?PHILLIPS: It's a hard question --(CROSSTALK)STRUNK: I think, you know, they aren't --MACCALLUM: Leigha, if you can. Thanks.PHILLIPS: Yes.STRUNK: Sorry.PHILLIPS: I'm not sure you can weigh -- I'm not sure you can weigh what's more important, a life or a life filled with pain and abuse. I mean, it's a valid point, and it's a concerning point. I know my colleagues and I are all concerned with, but I think there gets to be a point when society and the community has placed too much of a burden on schools to be the police of what's happening, to be the counselors, to do all of these different things.I think that employers, I think the community, and I think all stakeholders need to have an impact on that and need to step up and kind of fill in the gaps where kids are going to struggleMACCALLUM: Yes.PHILLIPS: -- because their life isn't worth it.(CROSSTALK)MACCALLUM: A lot of -- a lot of people are very concerned, you know, if they stay home for another semester or God forbid to the whole school year, all of the loss of learning could be devastating, it could really set a lot of these kids back for a long time.So, I thank you all for your dedication and for sharing your thoughts with us on this today. Leigha, Krista, and Phil, all the best to you as you head forward towards the school year.PHILLIPS: Thank you.MACCALLUM: Thank you very much.STRUNK: Thank you, Martha.MACCALLUM: Thank you.So, coming up, there has been a lot of talk about a violent crime surging in Chicago and New York, but the city of Detroit is also seeing a 29 percent increase in homicides this year. Detroit based Pulitzer Prize winning journalist Charlie LeDuff on whether the feds need to protect his city, next.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: Well, I'm going to do something, that I can tell you. Because we're not going to let New York, and Chicago, and Philadelphia, and Detroit, and Baltimore and all of these -- all cleaned. It's a mess. We're not going to let this happen in our country.(END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: Chicago should be calling us and so should Philadelphia and Detroit and others, to go in and really help them. Because when you're losing many people a weekend, many, many people, you see the same numbers as I do. When you're losing these people, they should call us and they should say come on in.And it's incredible to me but they're not doing it. At some point, they will. At some point we may have no other choice but to go in.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: So, with violent crime on the rise now in Detroit as well, President Trump hinting that it could be among the cities that receive some help from federal officers under the new Operation Legend that was announced yesterday.Homicides there are up 29 percent, and you know, good estimates. I think our next guests will tell us it's higher than that. Nonfatal shootings are up 52 percent over the same period last year, and over the weekend, there were 33 shooting incidents leaving 26 people injured and seven dead.Charlie LeDuff has covered Detroit extensively, he's a Pulitzer Prize winning journalist and says that the increase in crime is historical. He is the author of \"S Show\" there you go. \"This Country is Collapsing but the Ratings Are Great.\"Charlie, always good to see you. Thank you very much for being here.CHARLIE LEDUFF, AUTHOR, \"SH*TSHOW\": The title is still true, Martha.MACCALLUM: So, is the -- what's the answer here? Who needs to come in to help the situation in Detroit, what's the mayor doing about it?LEDUFF: What are they doing about it? First of all, we've had five mass shootings in two weeks, two quadruples, two quintuples, and a nine tuple. So, I don't know what this package is that the president is sending. Are you sending 10 agents? A 100 agents? A thousand? Because our own chief of police says he needs another thousand cops at least.So, we've entered into agreements with them -- they haven't really work what we have task force. ATF, FBI, DEA, the relationship between the Detroit police and the DEA is rotten, it's done. The chief threw them out because of an informant in January who went on a rampage and killed six people. So, I'd like to see some specifics. They had a relationship, now they don't and it's a political year so, I don't even -- I'm not even buying this.MACCALLUM: What's life like now in Detroit for people who live there?LEDUFF: What's it's like?MACCALLUM: Yes.LEDUFF: They are scared and they are angry and they want help. And I don't -- nobody seriously thinks you should defund the police because as we talked about before, we've already done it and look what's happening. And remember, in the next couple of days, those $600 super unemployment checks run out, then what happens?MACCALLUM: So, you heard the president, you know, he talks about sending help. Right?LEDUFF: Yes.MACCALLUM: You say that the police aren't doing their job because they are afraid of the ramifications, you talk about sending in state troopers. You know, what do you think having lived there and worked there and watched all of this, is there a solution that's going to make people safer on the streets?LEDUFF: I think we're in for a slog here, I think you know it and I think the country knows it, the police do do their jobs, there's not enough police to do it and some are afraid to do it. But just last week they pulled 106 guns off of 117 arrestees. Guns are everywhere, what could the governor do? She's not even talking about it, right? She's busy tweeting with the president.Madam, put the state police on the major thoroughfares in the city, seven- mile, six-mile, McNichols, Finco (Ph), five-mile, Telegraph, let them patrol the main boulevards so the police can be in the neighborhoods. That's one way to do it. We've got more state troopers than the president is sending federal agents.MACCALLUM: So, she's way ahead in job performance, she's at 64 percent. President Trump is at 45 percent in Michigan, what do you say about that before we go?LEDUFF: Well, we don't have a very rabid media in this state. You, I think we'll all notice she's got a lot of softball questions. She doesn't get good marks for the nursing homes, she hasn't addressed that. The Senate today voted to take COVID positive people out of nursing homes and have their own facilities.MACCALLUM: That's a good idea.LEDUFF: It's bipartisan. And she's threatening to veto it. And I got to go, Martha. That's all the time I have.MACCALLUM: All right, Charlie, thank you. Come back soon. Always good to talk to you. Best of luck.LEDUFF: Thank you.MACCALLUM: More of The Story coming up next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)MACCALLUM: You don't want to miss this in the latest episode of the Untold Story podcast.

Security Council to extend arms embargo against Iran,\u201d Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying said in a  Friday.\u201cWithout violating international obligations including Security Council resolutions, China can carry out normal arms trade cooperation with any country and such cooperation is beyond reproach.\u201dPresident Trump pulled out of the arms agreement in 2018, calling the Obama-era deal \u201cdecaying and rotten.\u201dIntelligence officials and U.N member states warned that the move could destabilize the region\u2019s security.\u201cThe U.S. has no right to criticize China on this issue. It unsigned the Arms Trade Treaty last year while China recently just joined it,\u201d Hua said Friday.\u201cThe two countries' attitudes towards international rules stand in such sharp contrast that they are self-explanatory.\u201dPompeo also warned the U.N. last month that should the embargo expire, Iran will be able to purchase \u201cRussian-made fighter jets\u201d\u00a0which have the capability to strike \u201cup to a 3,000-kilometer radius, putting cities like Riyadh, New Delhi, Rome, and Warsaw in Iranian crosshairs.\u201dPompeo suggested that China and Iran are already working to establish a relationship in arms sales.\u201cI think Europeans should stare at that and realize that the risk of this is real and that the work between Iran and the Chinese Communist Party may well commence rapidly and robustly on October 19th if we\u2019re not successful at extending the U.N. arms embargo,\u201d Pompeo said this week.The Trump administration is also pushing to have a new nuclear arms deal with Russia that includes China \u2013 though a top Russia diplomat, Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov\u00a0said he was not optimistic this agreement would be met. The New Strategic Arms Reduction\u00a0Treaty (START), which was signed in 2010 by former President Barack Obama and then Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, was made in accordance with the original nuclear arms deal from 1987 and worked to further eliminate the creation and stockpiles of nuclear arms.President Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin pulled out of the 1987 nuclear arms treaty last year, leaving the START treaty as the only nuclear non-proliferation agreement between the two countries.Should the treaty expire, it would be the first time the U.S. and Russia were not united in a nuclear arms agreement since the Cold War.Lavrov said that Russia would be willing to extend the treaty which is set to expire in Feb. 2021 without contingencies, but the U.S. is demanding that China sign the new agreement as well.China has repeatedly said they will not enter into an agreement that requires they reduce their nuclear arms.\u201cThe U.S. has conducted more nuclear testing than others, over a thousand at home and abroad, causing unspeakable damage to other countries' ecological environment,\u201d Hua said Friday. \u201cBy dragging China into this issue, it seeks to let itself off the hook and out of the straitjacket.\u201dShe added that China was one of the first signatories of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, an agreement that bans all testing of nuclear weapons, in 1996. \u201cWe hope the U.S. will stop playing dumb,\u201d Hua said from Friday\u2019s press conference.\u201cWith the largest nuclear arsenal, the US should respond to international concern, earnestly fulfill its special and primary responsibilities to nuclear disarmament, respond positively to Russia's call on extending the New START and further drastically reduce its nuclear arms stockpile.\u201d", "comment": "", "topic": "China", "date": " July 17"}, {"cover": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/07/156/88/KT.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "title": "McFarland: Trump is first leader to finally 'fight back' against China amid decades-long Cold War", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/media/kt-mcfarland-trump-first-leader-fight-china", "subtitle": "President Trump was the first \u201cleader who understood that the\u00a0Chinese have been at Cold War\u00a0with us for decades and now we\u2019re\u00a0finally taking the steps to\u00a0fight back,\u201d former deputy national security adviser\u00a0KT McFarland\u00a0told\u00a0\u201cOutnumbered Overtime\u201d on Wednesday.", "keyword": "U.S.-China trade war and protectionism", "website": "Fox News", "author": "Talia Kaplan", "content": "President Trump was the first \u201cleader who understood that the\u00a0 have been at Cold War\u00a0with us for decades and now we\u2019re\u00a0finally taking the steps to\u00a0fight back,\u201d former deputy national security adviser\u00a0\u00a0told\u00a0\u201c\u201d on Wednesday.McFarland made the comment the same day  what it called an \u201cunprecedented escalation\" by the United States and threatened to retaliate after it was ordered\u00a0to close the Chinese consulate in\u00a0Houston.In a statement sent to Fox News,\u00a0State Department Spokesperson Morgan Ortagus confirmed the directive and said it was issued\u00a0\"to protect American intellectual property and Americans'\u00a0private information.\u201dSen.

Those haven't\u00a0worked.\u00a0So, trying to close consulates\u00a0and other facilities: that might have more of an effect on\u00a0Beijing,\" he concluded.", "comment": "(876)", "topic": "Fox News Flash", "date": " July 22"}, {"cover": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/07/156/88/Screen-Shot-2020-07-08-at-3.52.42-PM.png?ve=1&tl=1", "title": "China experts expect TikTok ban 'by end of this week' as pressure mounts on Trump administration", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/media/trump-administration-china-experts-tiktok-ban", "subtitle": "Secretary of State Mike Pompeo expanded on his considerations to ban the mobile app TikTok, saying it was only one of a number of Chinese companies that need to be held accountable for threatening Americans' data.", "keyword": "U.S.-China trade war and protectionism", "website": "Fox News", "author": "Andrew Craft", "content": "Secretary of State Mike Pompeo expanded on his considerations to ban the mobile  TikTok, saying it was only one of a number of  companies that need to be held accountable for threatening Americans' data.\"We have been engaged in a constant evaluation, about ensuring that we protect the privacy of American citizens and their information...This doesn't relate to any one particular business or company, but rather to American national security,\" Pompeo said during a press conference.But experts on China are reading the tea leaves that a ban\u00a0on TikTok is imminent as the United States puts pressure on Chinese companies.\"I think that sometime this week we will hear an announcement from the Trump administration banning TikTok and possibly other Chinese apps,\" Gordon Chang, author of \"The Coming Collapse of China,\" told Fox News.President Donald Trump indicated as much in an interview yesterday with Gray Television: \"Yes, it's something we're looking at,\" he said when asked about Pompeo's remarks. Trump also said the ban would be \"one of many\" options to punish China for its coronavirus response.TikTok was invented in the United States and then acquired by Chinese company ByteDance, which is headquartered in Beijing. Chinese law allows any Chinese company to confiscate any and all data. There are no commensurate protections from government privacy intrusion like there are here in the U.S., opening the door for large transfers of American's data to the Chinese, usually unbeknownst to American citizens.\"Basically any Chinese technology, if you generate data, and you use Chinese technology, whether it's Lenovo laptop, a Huawei phone, or a TikTok app, all of that data is at risk of going to the Chinese government,\" Roslyn Layton, co-founder of Chinatechthreat.com, said in an interview with Fox News.Layton said a common misconception is that TikTok is also used in China, but it's not operative there. The social media\u00a0app\u00a0promotes free creative expression which is counter to free speech controls implemented by Chinese propaganda authorities. There is also no reciprocity when it comes to mobile apps. American-made apps are not allowed to be sold in China, but the reverse is the case in the U.S.Some experts and elected representatives are urging Americans not to\u00a0download the app.\"It collects your geolocation in realtime, that is a problem for soldiers and military personnel because they can be identified by the Chinese government, it's a problem for children, in fact, TikTok was fined by the Federal Trade Commission for illegally collecting child information...also for your beliefs, they wanted to censor those videos [on Hong Kong],\" said\u00a0 Layton, who also served as an advisor on Trump's\u00a0FCC transition team in 2016.TikTok has denied it collects Americans' data, telling Fox News in a statement,\u00a0\"TikTok is led by an American CEO, with hundreds of employees and key leaders across safety, security, product, and public policy here in the U.S. We have no higher priority than promoting a safe and secure app experience for our users. We have never provided user data to the Chinese government, nor would we do so if asked.\"But that assessment does not seem to have won over the White House. The options open to the president include issuing a proclamation forcing the divestiture of business holdings in the app or more sanctions on its parent company.TikTok reported 30 million monthly active users in the U.S. as of May and is popular with people between 16 and 24 years old.

Thanks for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo. Straight ahead right here on \"Sunday Morning Futures\": brand-new polls out on the presidential election coming up. Crime is up across the country, public trust is down, with just 107 days until election 2020, this as Congress returns to work tomorrow to hammer out a new coronavirus relief package before the August recess. They have got two weeks House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy on what to expect, as millions of Americans fear rent protections and extra unemployment benefits are set to expire. White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows is here with an insider's look from the White House, as the screws keep turning on China. Attorney General Bill Barr calls out corporate America for kowtowing to Beijing. Senator John Kennedy will join me with what his move will be next. Also, global investor Ray Dalio is here responding to A.G. Barr's warning about China. Plus, what does all of this mean for the 2020 election? Former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon with his message on President Trump on what it will take to win in November. All that and a lot more, as we look ahead right here, right now on \"Sunday Morning Futures.\" All that coming up, but, first, flags across the Capitol are at half-staff this morning in remembrance of civil rights icon John Lewis. The longtime Georgia congressman passed away Friday night after a battle with pancreatic cancer. He was 80 years old. A great patriot, Lewis was the last living speaker at the 1963 March on Washington, where Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his \"I Have a Dream\" speech. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy was his friend and colleague. He joins me now. Congressman, it is good to see you this morning. My condolences. REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA): Good to see you, Maria. Thank you. And I do want to talk about John Lewis just for a moment, because he lived such an extraordinary life and was an unbelievable man. At such a young age, he tried to cross a bridge simply to give people the right to vote. He did it in a peaceful manner. And he was beaten almost to his death. I have walked across that bridge with him before. And when he would tell the story, he would stop at a moment and says, I cannot remember past beyond this point, because they would beat him. And he did it in a peaceful manner to help change this nation that no longer do people are -- choice about which bathroom they use or which counter they eat on, or even registering to vote. BARTIROMO: Yes. MCCARTHY: He made this nation better. And he lived his life in a manner that we can all respect and live up to. And he was kind to all. And he -- I just spoke to him a couple weeks ago, checking on his health, but talking to him about what's happening in the nation today, because he did it in a peaceful manner to help preserve and to actually create a more perfect union. I think can -- a lot to understand him and live by his example to make this nation better. BARTIROMO: Yes, thank you for that. When we go to break, after our interview, we're going to show a little clip of John Lewis, which is a beautiful clip and something that I know that our audience will love. So, stay with us for that. But let me get to the business at hand for our viewers. And you're going back to -- Congress will return to work tomorrow. And you are looking at a potential next stimulus package, a relief package. What should be in that package, Congressman? MCCARTHY: A number of things should be in that package. But we also have a large amount of money, more than about $1.5 trillion, still out there that we have already appropriated that we need to get into this economy. But the things I look for are the things we need to do. We need liability of protection, because these small businesses are questioning whether they can open again, our schools and others. So, let's protect those as we move forward. Let's also look at, any time you're using federal money, it shouldn't give you a -- de-incentivize the ability to work. We have made a mistake where we overpaid on unemployment insurance, where now it's hard for people to come back to work because they're making more on unemployment than they can working. So we have got to straighten that out as we move forward. I would look at places that we could -- should prioritize the safety when it comes to child care or for our children and our teachers inside schools. And then I would look at the supply chain. If we learn nothing from this, not the lies of China, but bringing those jobs back to America, but also our supply chain itself, not being beholden to China for so much of our critical minerals and others. Let's find a way that we improve it here and for our stockpiling. I would do that in a different manner, working with the private sector to stockpile it. BARTIROMO: Well, so the president would like schools to open in the fall, Congressman. Will there be money in this next bill for schools? And what about the states? Are these the priorities right now for that next bill? MCCARTHY: Well, the uniqueness of what we have right now, Maria, we have more than $100 billion that we have already appropriated that can go to the states. I think we can look at ways that we can make that greater flexibility. And lots of times, we're finding, when we sent these moneys to these governors, that they have held it up, instead of pushing it down to the counties and the cities. I would like to see more flexibility, where it goes to the counties and cities in the place of need. We would look at hospitals if they need more in the process of where we're going forward. BARTIROMO: Yes. MCCARTHY: We also have more than $100 billion sitting there for such a successful program of PPP for small businesses that saved millions of jobs. Now we're seeing that some states have to close certain portions. Is there a greater need for small businesses? We already have money sitting there. BARTIROMO: Well... MCCARTHY: So, could we use the money already appropriated to solve some of these problems? BARTIROMO: Sure. I understand. But, you know, the Democrats are pushing back on the president saying he wants to open schools. And I wonder how much of this is politics, although, you know, it is scary for parents to say, we're going to send our kids back to school, and we don't know what the situation is in terms of the coronavirus. We're seeing spikes across the country. Here is what President Trump told me just recently when I interviewed him at the beginning of this pandemic. Listen to this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BARTIROMO: Your critics want you to keep it closed going into the election? DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Yes, I do. I do. I think it's a political thing, in addition. I think some sense... BARTIROMO: Because they're saying you're putting money, business ahead of lives. TRUMP: No, no. I think the people that want to see the right thing happen, they agree with me. We have to get our country open. You know, if it was up to some people, let's keep it closed for a long time, OK, a long time. And watch the United States go down the tubes. Not going to happen. (END VIDEO CLIP) BARTIROMO: I mean, I guess we are going to be living with this, Congressman. But can we actually go back to our normal lives safely right now, given these spikes that we're seeing across the country? MCCARTHY: In certain parts of the country, you can. Nobody wants to send somebody to school that's unsafe. That's why Congress should actually look at this. How can we protect when it comes to child care, the children in school and the teachers? But what's more important, when you look at these recent studies, you're finding that children can -- should not -- have not kept their reading, their writing and their math, losing more than 30 percent of it. We cannot have a whole generation that's uneducated. BARTIROMO: Yes. MCCARTHY: So, what we need to do is actually put that plan together, because we have got to make sure schools can reopen. And that takes a responsibility of what we're doing. Now we're finding, even in California, where L.A. and San Diego say they're not going to open for the whole year? BARTIROMO: Wow. MCCARTHY: Remember what is happening here with Warp Speed. We have got five companies that are in BARDA that have a real promise of having a vaccine, could even be this year, or the therapies that are coming forward. Tomorrow is going to be better than today, based upon what this administration is doing. BARTIROMO: Yes, but look what is happening to our cities. MCCARTHY: Yes. BARTIROMO: Look what's happening to our cities. I know you have a bill right now to punish anybody who is taking down statues. But there's a massive movement across the country on the other side of the aisle. Your colleagues on the left, they want to defund the police. Listen to Joe Biden recently. Here it is. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) QUESTION: Can we agree that we can redirect some of the funding? JOSEPH BIDEN (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Yes, absolutely. One of the things that we also need to be doing is fundamentally changing the way -- and I have been pushing it for years -- changing the way we deal with our prison system. It should be a rehabilitation system, not a punishment system. (END VIDEO CLIP) BARTIROMO: Well, what does that mean, Congressman? Because we are seeing this bail reform in New York allow criminals back on the street. And that's one of the reasons crime is skyrocketing. What is your responsibility, as the leader of the GOP, to get law and order back in place in this country? MCCARTHY: Well, every American should be scared right now, because what you just showed country was Joe Biden said, yes, he is for defunding the police. You have got Congresswoman Omar, who wants to dismantle America. Then you have got Nancy Pelosi, who is allowing them to destroy America from statues and on. We have a responsibility for rule and law and for justice. And what we're watching the Democrats doing -- watch what Nancy Pelosi just said the other day. She thinks what's happening is -- in Portland is a graffiti problem. No, it's a mob problem that is overrunning. You have people across this nation scared to death. You have young children being murdered... BARTIROMO: Yes. MCCARTHY: ... because what they're doing to the police department. This is wrong. I introduced a bill... BARTIROMO: So, your bill -- your bill does what? MCCARTHY: When law... BARTIROMO: Yes. MCCARTHY: Our bill will withhold federal grants for cities that do not uphold and protect the statues... BARTIROMO: OK. MCCARTHY: ... because the cities have the responsibility for law and order, not to leave these precincts, not to allow these mobs to rule our communities. BARTIROMO: Wow. Yes. MCCARTHY: We have to stand up to this. BARTIROMO: It is scary out there. I agree with you. Congressman, it's good to see you this morning. We certainly will be watching the developments. Thanks so much, Congressman Kevin McCarthy, this morning. We will see you soon, sir. Thank you. Coming up: White House chief of staff Mark Meadows on the hot seat over the administration's response to the coronavirus. As we take a break, a look at the late, great John Lewis. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BARTIROMO: Welcome back. We have got new FOX News polls released this morning. And it shows coronavirus is the number one issue for voters headed into the 2020 election. More than half of them disapprove of how the president has handled this pandemic. I'm joined right now by the White House's chief of staff, Mark Meadows. He has been leading the administration through this crisis. And, Mark, it is good to have you this morning. Thanks very much for joining us. First off, what can you say to your critics who say the president has fallen short in his response to the pandemic? MARK MEADOWS, WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF: Well, obviously, any time that we get faced with something that is new and unusual, you actually have to engage. And so this came from China. In the last four or five months, we have been having to figure out how to provide personal protective equipment, ventilators, making sure that we have hospital beds. And I can tell you, as we look forward, there are a number of things that we're working on to make sure that we have the therapeutics, even as recent as, this morning, shipments going to Florida and Indiana and other places to make sure that some of the treatments that are needed in these critical areas are actually happening. And I also can tell you that it's a 24/7 around-the-clock kind of work. I was on the phone with the president this morning, as we were working on some of the responses. You will see some new initiatives coming out this week, as the president is not only leading, but will continue to lead and step in a number of fronts. One of those that you just mentioned earlier, Maria, is about our schools. How are we going to open our schools and make sure that moms and dads don't have to worry about the safety of our children that are going back to schools? And so there will be over $70 billion that this president has already authorized to work with Congress to try to make sure that we not only keep the classrooms safe, but the teachers safe and the students safe. BARTIROMO: Right. MEADOWS: And you will see a very broad five to six points in terms of what we will be doing in terms of making sure that our schools are safe. BARTIROMO: That's really important. Obviously, we are going to have to live with this for a little while, before we get the innovation from our pharma sector and a vaccine. Tell me what the president would like to see in another relief package, Mark. Where are we in terms of the relief and the impact on the economy and people's livelihoods? MEADOWS: Well, there's -- the discussions have just started over the last week or so. We have been having a number of internal discussions over the last couple of months. But, as we have started to engage with our Senate and House colleagues up on Capitol Hill, those will start in earnest starting tomorrow. Monday, I know that Leader McConnell and Leader McCarthy will be coming into meet with the president and Steven Mnuchin, who is leading it from our side, to actually start to fine-tune it. So I'd see there's three different areas that we're going to make sure of, that we have enough money to make sure that we expedite not only the Warp Speed as it relates to the treatments that we have, whether it be therapeutics or vaccines, but we also want to make sure that we keep people employed. When you look at the economy and where we need to go with it, we're not going to be shy about making sure that we have protections for the American worker and those that employ individuals. And so you're going to see an additional thrust there. It looks like that that new package will be in the trillion-dollar range, as we have started to look at it, whether it's a payroll tax deduction, whether it's making sure that unemployment benefits continue, without a disincentive to return to work. And then, bluntly, we're looking at a number of areas to look at manufacturing, bringing some of those critical manufacturing jobs back from overseas, so that we're never put in a situation where we have to depend on foreign countries to make sure that we can protect Americans. BARTIROMO: And the president has talked about the crime across the country as well. Is there something coming in terms of an executive order on returning law and order to this country? MEADOWS: Well, he's already done a couple of things. But he's working very closely with Attorney General Barr. I can tell you that, this week, what we're looking at is not only looking at what a lot of people have called the executive order on statues, which he did that. But that's really -- the statues are one thing, but it's really about keeping our communities safe. And the president's committed to do that. Some of the unrest that we saw even in the last month or so, but particularly last night and the week leading up to it, in Portland, it's just not acceptable, when you look at communities not being safe and not upholding the rule of law. BARTIROMO: Yes. That's right. MEADOWS: So, Attorney General Barr is weighing in on that, with Secretary Wolf. And you will see something rolled out this week as we start to go in and make sure that the communities, whether it's Chicago, or Portland, or Milwaukee, or someplace across the heartland of the country. We need to make sure that our communities are safe. BARTIROMO: Mark, let me turn to the Russia probe. You did such an excellent job when you were on the Oversight Committee in terms of zeroing in on the origins of the Russia probe. We now know, for sure -- Lindsey Graham told us this about a month ago, actually, so our audience was aware, that the FBI knew that the dossier was just made-up garbage, and the subsource told the FBI agents that. And yet Jim Comey and Andrew McCabe kept on pushing forward, renewing warrants to spy on Carter Page. Your reaction to what we know now. And when are we going to hear from John Durham? Will there be indictments, sir? MEADOWS: Well, I think the American people expect indictments. I know I expect indictments, based on the evidence I have seen. Lindsey Graham did a good job in getting that out. We know that they not only knew that there wasn't a case, but they continued to investigate and spy -- and, yes, I use the word spy -- on Trump campaign officials, and, actually, even doing things when this president was sworn in, and after that, and doing it in an inappropriate manner. You're going to see a couple of other documents come out in the coming days that will suggest that, not only was the campaign spied on, but the FBI did not act appropriately as they were investigating. It's all starting to come unravel -- to unravel. And I tell you, it's time that people go to jail and people are indicted. BARTIROMO: It's just unbelievable that, for three years, this president was investigated and investigated again over something that wasn't even true, and the entire country was up in arms about collusion. I mean, you know, I don't hear anything on the other side of the aisle about this wrongdoing, which is just stunning to me. MEADOWS: Well, it is stunning. And here is the interesting thing is, it's not only that it wasn't true. The problem is, they knew it wasn't true. BARTIROMO: Right. MEADOWS: And when you know something is not true, and you continue the investigation, that's collusion. That's the kind of thing that we must stop. And that's what we -- where we need to hold people accountable. BARTIROMO: Mark, it's great to have you this morning. Please come back soon. Thanks so much. MEADOWS: Thanks, Maria. BARTIROMO: Mark Meadows joining us there. Coming up next, Louisiana Senator John Kennedy with breaking news on what to expect from the Senate, as we look ahead on \"Sunday Morning Futures.\" Stay with us. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Lawmakers are returning to Washington tomorrow to negotiate the next coronavirus relief package, but can both sides reach an agreement before millions of Americans lose their extra unemployment benefits at the end of July? Joining me right now with his expectations for a bill is Louisiana Senator John Kennedy. He serves on the Banking, Budget and Appropriations Committee. Sir, it's great to see you this morning. Thanks so much for joining me. SEN. JOHN KENNEDY (R-LA): You bet. BARTIROMO: What are your priorities for a next stimulus bill? Do you want to get something out before the recess starts again on August 8? KENNEDY: Well, it depends on what's in the bill, Maria. I don't know what's going to be in the bill. I don't know if there will be a bill. And, frankly, neither does anyone else. It takes 60 votes to pass a bill in the Senate. The only thing I'm certain of right now is that the bill we pass, if we pass one, will not be Speaker Pelosi's bill. It is untethered to reality. And among most senators, including many Democrats, it's about as popular as a sinkhole. Among the topics that we will talk about will be, number one, maybe the most important, getting our schools open, money, extra money for K-12. Most fair-minded people believe that keeping our schools closed will do far more damage to our kids than the coronavirus ever can. Having said that, I know a lot of parents are scared. If you don't want to send your child back to school, you shouldn't, and you shouldn't be forced to. And if you're a teacher or an employee, and you don't want to go back, don't. That's between you and the school board. But I think we will have enough kids, enough teachers, and enough employees, with the right resources, to get our schools open. We probably shouldn't have closed them down to begin with. BARTIROMO: There is also some consensus on limiting ability for businesses, schools, and government in terms of their liability. Is there consensus there? Will that be in the next bill? KENNEDY: There's not a consensus on anything. But the other issues we will talk about will be, as you pointed out, limiting liability for our schools and our universities and our hospitals. We will work on trying to give relief to people laid off who lose their health insurance. We will talk about additional PPP. We will talk about additional unemployment compensation. Payroll tax cut will be on the table, as will direct stimulus payments to American people. BARTIROMO: OK. KENNEDY: But, again, there's not a -- there's not even close to a consensus yet. BARTIROMO: You are also working on a bill. I want to move on to China. You're working on a bill that will prohibit American companies from collaborating with the Chinese Communist Party. A really stunning speech this week by Attorney General Bill Barr. Let's hear that. And then I want to get your take on where we are with China. Here is Bill Barr. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WILLIAM BARR, U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL: The ultimate ambition of China's rulers isn't to trade with the United States. It is to raid the United States. If you are an American business leader, appeasing the PRC may bring short- term rewards, but, in the end, the PRC's goal is to replace you. (END VIDEO CLIP) BARTIROMO: Pretty stunning comments there, Senator. What can you tell us about this? The A.G. called out technology companies Cisco, Google, Microsoft, Yahoo, Apple, all by name. What is at stake if these companies continue working with China? KENNEDY: General Barr, in my estimation, is absolutely correct. The Chinese people are wonderful people, but their government, the Communist Party of China, is comprised of a bunch of outlaws. They're bullies. They understand only strength. If you're too nice to them, if you turn the other cheek, they just stab you in the neck. The poster child for what the general was talking about is the leadership at the National Basketball Association. The NBA leadership is so greedy, so anxious to do business in China that they do whatever the Chinese Communist Party tells them to do. If the party told the leadership of the NBA to join the Taliban, the NBA leadership would say, where's the line? I'm working on a bill that would prohibit American companies from giving in to this bullying by the Communist Party of China. It would say, basically, if you give in to them, you violate American law. Now, it's a delicate bill to draft, and we're working on it. BARTIROMO: Yes. KENNEDY: But Barr is right. BARTIROMO: We want to show you this video of the Uyghurs in China. Now, this video was shot in 2018, so it's not new. But what it clearly shows are the Muslims and the Tibetans that are locked up in camps in China. They are blindfolded. They are being lined up. And what can you tell us? What is the responsibility of the free world to take a stand against these people being locked up in China? The Chinese Communist Party has pushed back and said, it's none of your business what goes on in other countries, Senator. KENNEDY: \u00a0Well, in my estimation, what the Chinese Communist Party has done to the Tibetans and the Uyghurs is despicable. All the Tibetans and the Uyghurs want to do is practice their religion. And the Communist Party in China says, your religion is the Communist Party of China. And we have to stand up to them, not just other governments, other Western democracies, but those who value free enterprise as well. And for those of my colleagues on Capitol Hill who admire the authoritarian socialist approach of countries like China... BARTIROMO: Yes. KENNEDY: ... I will just tell you, look at the Uyghurs, look at the Tibetans. Look what China is doing now, causing mischief with India, in the South China Sea, in Hong Kong. All they understand is -- I don't want to start a cold war with China, but weakness invites the wolves. And we have to be firm with them. BARTIROMO: Yes. And, on Thursday, the president signed the Hong Kong sanctions bill, unanimously passed by the bipartisan Senate. This is an important message. I just will point out that China has already sanctioned Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz. (LAUGHTER) BARTIROMO: And they say that this is holding -- this is for them holding CCP officials accountable for what's going on in China, Senator, real quick. KENNEDY: I think Ted and Marco probably will wear the sanctions as a badge of honor. For 20 years, we have been told by the commentariat that we have to be patient with China, that free enterprise will change them. BARTIROMO: Yes. KENNEDY: They're trying to change free enterprise. BARTIROMO: Senator, thank you so much. We will be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Well, it is 107 days until America will vote for its next president, in what could be one of the most important policy-based elections in history. My next guest knows what it takes to win the White House. He helped lead Donald Trump to victory in 2016 as the chief executive of his campaign. Joining me right now is once again former White House chief strategist, host of \"War Room: Pandemic,\" Steve Bannon. Steve, it's great to see you this morning. Thanks for being here. We want to roll out these polls this morning from FOX News and get your take on all of this, because, once again, we see the president lagging. What do you think is going on? Here is President Trump on the economy, 47 percent approve, 47 percent disapprove, Steve. And then you have got other polls which show the president lagging Joe Biden. Your take? STEVE BANNON, FORMER WHITE HOUSE CHIEF STRATEGIST: Listen, when you go back and look in -- I think it was in March, 51 percent of the American people thought President Trump was doing a good job, a solid job in leadership on this pandemic. I think, in the poll, it's 37, 38 percent, something like this. This is about just bold action and bold leadership. What I think the president should do, my recommendation would be, every day, start to have the top people around you, Dr. Fauci, Dr. Birx, the vice president, Dr. Redfield at CDC, Chief of Staff Meadows, have them in the Oval, get briefed every day on an action plan, just drive action, action, action, and do it through action, urgency, and focus. And get a plan for masks. Get a plan for the schools. Bring the governors in, but with those five people around the desk. And then every couple of days, you bring in the media, and you tell them what the plan of the day is. You tell them where we're driving action. President Trump is a man of action. When he's taken action on whether shutting down China, shutting down Europe, declaring this a national emergency, when President Trump is taking action, the polls reflect this. I would -- I think the polls should be an indication to people in the White House that, hey, you're in the driver's seat here. Just go back to the plan you have got. And, also, you have made a decision about federalism, I think, is very smart, but include the governors now, particularly as this kind of weaponized virus is impervious to summer heat and humidity. It also is asymptomatic. It also targets and looks like it targets the most vulnerable. And so this is where they have to have, I think, targeted interventions. I think Dr. Birx has talked about this in the past. The White House has all the elements. I think it's just bringing it together around President Trump in a principals only, and every couple of days bring the media in there and let President Trump explain what actions he's taking, not one of these two- hour press conferences, where the media can throw out all these other questions. But focus on the pandemic. If you focus on the pandemic, you will start to make real progress. And I think the polls will all start to fall in place. Remember, the CCP lied. Americans died. I think the president can take leadership in this and drive this. And I think the polls will take care of themselves. BARTIROMO: What can you say about Joe Biden's plans right now, Steve? This week, the former vice president unveiled a climate plan to cost $2 trillion. Look, he is going to be raising taxes. He's already discussed that, that he's going to be raising taxes. If Elizabeth Warren is his running mate, she -- or not -- she could be Treasury secretary, but she will certainly be an important, key voice in the economy. She wants to institute a wealth tax. You know, look, we are facing a $22 trillion debt. And you would say, OK, you have to raise taxes in that regard. But he's using that higher revenue to come up with things like a $2 trillion green plan. What's your take on Biden's agenda? BANNON: Look, Biden doesn't know what his agenda is. He's trying to reinvent himself every other day. He goes up to Scranton, Pennsylvania, and makes this kind of populist economic nationalist speech. He's really the concierge of Wilmington, Delaware, which is the headquarters of all the global corporations. You know, Joe Biden, to me, has to come forward to the American people and tell what his plan on China is. The president's kind of war council has laid out the four horsemen of the Apocalypse against the Chinese Communist Party, the national security adviser, head of the FBI, the secretary of state, and then obviously Secretary -- Attorney General Barr in that magnificent speech. Those four individuals laid out an integrated and coherent war plan to confront the Chinese Communist Party on technological and information war and economic war, and then, with our allies, start to open up the South China Sea, and support our allies in India on the border of Chinese- occupied Tibet. You're seeing an integrated war plan put together to take down -- confront first and then take down the Chinese Communist Party, to call their bluff. And Joe Biden, in his entire speech the other day on economics, mentioned China, I think, one time, talking about electric vehicles. Joe Biden is the candidate of globalization. He's a total globalist. He has kowtowed to the Chinese Communist Party. The president has a coherent plan against the Chinese Communist Party. I would like the secretary of Treasury to join in there and Treasury to start to drop the hammer. But you have seen a coherent war plan. I think you have just got to get that same level of coherence on the Chinese virus that's here, the CCP virus that has come to the United States. And I think, if you do that, things will come together. And I don't think Joe Biden has an answer. So far, it's been virtually incoherent. BARTIROMO: Yes, I want to come back to the China story in a second. But who do you think Joe Biden will choose as his vice presidential candidate? BANNON: Well, I think the polling internal to Biden, the number one thing they're looking at is somebody that can't -- that can't throw him off the - - where he's going right now. So, I think whether it's Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris, I think they're looking at a number of candidates. I don't think it's going to matter, at the end of the day, who his V.P. is, because, really, I think Joe Biden is the one that is going to get smoked out. If President Trump continues to drive action, that -- and Biden is going to be smoked out and going to have to really confront President Trump on the hustings. And I just don't think he's going to stand up. BARTIROMO: Yes. BANNON: Right now, remember, he -- nothing he puts forward is really coherent. And he's trying to reform himself as a -- or rebrand himself as a populist and economic nationalist, against 45 years of his track record. It is going to be very, very difficult, as the Trump campaign, as a full -- force multiplier off of what's happening at the White House, I think, begins to really identify and kind of brand Joe Biden for what he is. BARTIROMO: Yes, that was an incredible speech that A.G. Barr made this week, basically calling out corporate America, Steve, to say, look, you can not collaborate with the Chinese Communist Party, that you are putting profits over the short term ahead of the real issues around national security over the long term. Do you think, increasingly, companies are getting it, or are they still seeing the opportunity to sell widgets to 1.4 billion people? BANNON: Well, they better get it, because he put a shot across their bow when he talked about FARA, and he said, hey, not only -- he used the word - - remember, this is a very smart guy. He used collaborator and appeasement, OK, collaboration and appeasement. Those words were specifically chosen by Attorney General Barr to put corporate America on notice. Then he talked about FARA. He talked about you guys being lobbyists and actually being unregistered foreign agents. So this is something that he really threw down on. And I have got to tell you, it was a magnificent speech. The other ones of the NSA director, of the FBI director, of Pompeo also have to be reviewed in an entire context of where President Trump is taking this, really, I think, as a war leader, on economic and information war. What we have to do today is then stop playing games with the CCP. Stop being a supplicant about this virus. We have to tell them, I believe, you turn over every piece of information, you open up the P4 lab, you let Americans and other scientists from around the world go in there and interview everybody, get every document, or we're going to cut you off. We're going to cut you off from the U.S. dollar. We're going to sanction your banks. BARTIROMO: Wow. BANNON: And we're going to sanction the highest members of the Chinese Communist Party, Wang Qishan and Xi. It's time for -- President Trump has got a great saying: no games. It's time to stop playing games with this murderous dictatorship. BARTIROMO: Yes. BANNON: They lied. The American people have died. Their own people have suffered immensely. BARTIROMO: Wow. BANNON: The Communist Party -- people -- the Chinese Communist people -- the people there are innocent victims of this dictatorship. Bill Barr called it out. Right now, Secretary of State Pompeo has to say, you open up every lab. BARTIROMO: Yes. BANNON: And the secretary of Treasury should come in, with the backing of the president of the United States... BARTIROMO: Yes. BANNON: ... and say, we're off the dollar. We're sanctioning every bank. We're going to sanction individuals, until you come clean. BARTIROMO: Oh, my goodness. BANNON: And we're going to get therapeutics and a vaccine and know exactly what this thing is. Listen, this thing being asymptomatic, this thing being... BARTIROMO: Yes. BANNON: \u00a0... impervious to humidity and heat, this thing targeting the most vulnerable population, the aged, comorbidities, minorities... BARTIROMO: OK. BANNON: ... this virus, we know very little about. It's time for them to stop hiding the information. BARTIROMO: All right, we got to jump. My next guest will have a thing or two to say about that. I will speak with Ray Dalio, global investor. Steve Bannon, thank you so much. We will be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Attorney General Bill Barr this week called on American companies to stop appeasing the Chinese Communist Party, saying -- quote -- \"The ultimate ambition of China's rulers is not to trade with the United States. It is to raid the United States. If you are an American business leader, appeasing the PRC may bring short-term rewards, but, in the end, the PRC's goal is to replace you\" -- from A.G. Bill Barr this week. Joining me right now is the co-chief investment officer, the co-chairman and the founder of Bridgewater Associates, Ray Dalio, who has studied China and dynasties for decades. Ray, it's great to have you this morning. Thanks so much for joining us. RAY DALIO, CO-CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER/CO-CHAIRMAN, BRIDGEWATER ASSOCIATES: \u00a0Good to be here. BARTIROMO: And I know that you have been to China many times. You have invested in China. What is your reaction to what you're hearing from Bill Barr, Ray? DALIO: Well, look, I'm a mechanic. I'm -- I just look at cause-effect relationships and what things are like, and so not ideological. I have been to China, as you say, for 35 years. And I watch them. And I -- we're operating in a world in which they are a, let's call it, worthy opponent, that each country seeks to do what's in its own interest. And there's a battle over wealth and power. And that's internal or external. And each company, when they go there, forms their own view about what it's like. And then there's law. And so the way I view that comment or that assessment is that, if the government is going to do something that will have an effect, they will have to create laws, and that those laws will determine what companies are going to do. They will behave according to those laws. BARTIROMO: Right. DALIO: Otherwise, you're going to have individual companies make their own assessments. And from my assessment of going to China and being there, it's not like the China that is being painted. It's not this communist -- it is highly capitalist. The enterprise system is operating, meaning, you go there, and the innovation and the things are powerful. And that's why you're seeing so many issues with competition. It's -- Huawei is about competition. And their technologies are quite amazing. So, it is a definitely worthy opponent. BARTIROMO: Yes. DALIO: And what's happening now, in the rise of a great power to challenge an existing great power, is the same sort of thing that's happened in the 1930-to-'45 period. So I hope we have a chance to talk about that, because there are other things that are related... BARTIROMO: Yes. DALIO: ... that all come together to determine -- to set the stage that we're now in. BARTIROMO: Well, I want to talk more about this, because you say Huawei is quite competitive, but isn't Huawei a collection of assets of Nortel Networks? Was many of those assets stolen? I mean, how do you look at China as a player that is just a competitor, when, in fact, they may very well be stealing intellectual property? I want to get into that when you -- when we come back. Let's take a short break. We're talking with Ray Dalio this morning. And he's not only looking at China, but the enormous amount of stimulus thrown at this economy. We will get into it when we come right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) \u00a0BARTIROMO: And we are back with Bridgewater's co-chairman and co- investments officer, Ray Dalio. And, Ray, we were talking about China. I do want to get into the broader economy and the impact there. You have been studying stimulus, in terms of all of this money being thrown at this economy. What do you think the implications are, Ray? DALIO: I'm going to pick up quickly with your China piece, and then I will come to the other. I'm just a practical man who has studied histories. And what's happening now has happened all through the history. In particular, I studied the rises and declines of empires and the reserve currency, starting with the Dutch -- they had the world empire -- the British, the United States, and now. BARTIROMO: Right. DALIO: And through that period of time, there is what you call stealing. There has always been the taking of ideas. The British took, hired architects, who took from the Dutch, who had the shipbuilding. And that was their main competitive advantage. It's a reality. And I think it's important to see that arc. Part of that arc, as you're referring to, has... BARTIROMO: It's an important point. DALIO: Sorry? Part of... BARTIROMO: I said it's an important point that you're making. DALIO: Yes. There's an arc in which it's like competition. They might -- internally, you might say somebody's stealing their ideas. Well, that's right. I mean, that's just the practicality. And in the world, you don't have the same kind of rules. It's more of a jungle. You don't have laws. And so it's just a practicality... (CROSSTALK) BARTIROMO: So, should we just say, well, China is going to beat us? I mean, should we just sit back and say, well, look, this is a threat and that's it? DALIO: No. No, I think you just have to see it for what it is, and deal with it well, right? In other words, don't deal with it emotionally. Approach it like a chess game. If I make this move, it will have this implication. And so I think, if it was clear -- questions like, do you want to go to war? There is -- there are four types of wars brewing. There is a trade war, there's a technology war, there's a geopolitical war, and there might be a capital war. BARTIROMO: Yes. DALIO: And so just do you want to approach it as that? How do you approach it intelligently to win that war? Our biggest issue is our own... BARTIROMO: Ray, we really need to talk about the economy. We need to talk about the economy. We hope you will come back next weekend, Ray. Thank you so much, Ray Dalio joining us. And that'll do it for \"Sunday Morning Futures.\" I'm Maria Bartiromo.

Its mass detention of Uyghurs, its godless decisions to replace church displays of the Ten Commandments with words from General Secretary Xi have not gone without being called out.\"Despite the recent tough talk, the administration has seemed to take a hodgepodge of stances on criticizing China, oftentimes depending on the issue. Trump has railed against China for taking advantage of the United States on trade deals since the 2016 campaign. But\u00a0he's often praised Chinese President Xi Jinping himself.Meanwhile, the U.S. has maintained a consistent message against China's claims in the South China Sea during the Trump administration, regularly executing freedom of navigation operations with U.S. Navy vessels. But Trump himself roiled Republicans last fall when he congratulated Xi on his country's 70th anniversary, refraining from any criticism of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).The Trump administration has sought to stymie the Chinese-controlled tech company Huawei from global 5G networks \u2014\u00a0something it just secured a major victory\u00a0at with the United Kingdom recently deciding to freeze Huawei out of its 5G infrastructure. But Trump, according to a memoir by his former National Security Adviser John Bolton, had indicated he personally didn't care about China's repression of ethnic minorities, specifically the Uyghur Muslims.\"At the opening dinner of the Osaka G20 meeting, with only interpreters present, Xi explained to Trump why he was basically building concentration camps in Xinjiang. According to our interpreter, Trump had said that Xi should go ahead with building the camps, which he thought was exactly the right thing to do,\" Bolton said. \"[Deputy National Security Advisor Matt] Pottinger told me Trump said something very similar during the 2017 trip to China, which meant we could cross repression of Uighurs off our list of possible reasons to sanction China, at least as long as trade negotiations continued.\"Trump and those in his administration have repeatedly condemned Bolton and his book, denying many of the allegations it contains.Now, amid the continuing fallout from the president's handling of the coronavirus pandemic, with Trump angrily deflecting blame for the virus toward China -- where it originated -- Pompeo and the State Department are putting rhetorical pressure on China with\u00a0renewed vigor.\"Countries that want to be global powers, countries that want to participate on the global stage, have a corresponding obligation to comply to the promises they make. China made a promise to the World Health Organization. There's a set of rules about disclosure, and when you have\u00a0 an incident in your country that could potentially lead to a pandemic, you have an obligation to report that and allow others co tome in and helo,\" Pompeo said in a video tweeted last week that was originally on The Hill's \"Virtually Live.\"The United States has withdrawn from the World Health Organization over its alleged compliance with China in covering up the coronavirus in its initial stages.Pompeo added: \"The Chinese Communist Party chose differently, they co-opted the World Health Organization to achieve that coverup, and the result today is that we have hundreds of thousands of people who have died and trillions of dollars in global damage as a direct result.\"Trump got at a similar point in an interview with \"Fox News Sunday.\"\"It came from China. They should've never let it escape. They should've never let it out,\" he said.Trump later continued: \"The World Health got a tremendous amount wrong. They basically did whatever China wanted them to. And we'll save now almost $500 million a year, which is nice. But the World Health got a lot wrong.\"China, meanwhile, has shot back in the diplomatic war of words, accusing the United States of mishandling the coronavirus and even at one point falsely accusing the U.S. Army of introducing the virus into China.\"The #US politicizes #COVID19 response at home and uses 'attacking China'\u00a0as a panacea for domestic problems. A real-life #HouseofCards\u00a0is on in #Washington, with people's lives at stake,\" Hua Chunying, a  for the country's foreign ministry, said in a tweet last week.It's unclear where U.S.-China relations could go from this increasingly hostile juncture, with another grand trade deal, cooperation on North Korea or reconciliation on geopolitical claims in East Asia looking increasingly unlikely. But any kind of military conflict still appears far-fetched, and\u00a0neither nation appears poised to institute new tariffs on the other -- private businesses in both countries continue to work in the other, with American businesses like the NBA still reluctant to even  China's human rights abuses, let alone take any action or make any statements on the matter.For now, tit-for-tat sanctions appear to be as far as either country will go, with Trump this month signing the Hong Kong Autonomy Act, a bill to sanctions Chinese entities that have contributed to eroding the freedoms once enjoyed in Hong Kong and financial institutions that do business with them. The\u00a0executive branch also announced sanctions in relation to the oppression of the Uyghur Muslims.Meanwhile, China\u00a0sanctioned some U.S. individuals, including Republican Sens. Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio. Cruz, a close ally of the administration, echoed the rhetoric from Pompeo in his response.\"Unfortunately for CCP leaders, I don't have plans to travel to the authoritarian regime that covered up the coronavirus pandemic and endangered millions of lives worldwide,\" Cruz said in a statement that also condemned\u00a0the \"horrific forced abortions and sterilizations\" of the Uyghur Muslims.", "comment": "", "topic": "State Department", "date": " July 20"}, {"cover": "https://a57.foxnews.com/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/694940094001/77ea0880-4f15-4598-982b-7b9f67770bf3/1292c71f-6f21-467e-ab9f-2e3be24c3339/1280x720/match/156/88/image.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "title": "Larry Kudlow slams Joe Biden's economic agenda, warns China is not to be trusted, predicts strong recovery", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/transcript/larry-kudlow-slams-joe-bidens-economic-agenda-warns-china-is-not-to-be-trusted-predicts-strong-recovery", "subtitle": "Guests: Larry Kudlow, Bernard Kerik, John Eastman, Sol Wisenberg, Lou Holtz, Scott Jensen, Stephen Smith", "keyword": "U.S.-China trade war and protectionism", "website": "Fox News", "author": "", "content": "LAURA INGRAHAM,HOST: All right. I'm Laura Ingraham. This is \"The Ingraham Angle\" from Washington tonight. Now, while he sees police force retires in droves, New York Mayor Bill de Blasio was personally putting the finishing touches on a Black Lives Matter mural in front of Trump Tower, that's going to create a lot of jobs Bill.Former NYPD Commissioner Bernie Kerik, oh, boy he's here. You don't want to miss it. It's going to be a scorcher.Also, ignoring the science on COVID has induced a war on American life. Now, we're now seeing this play out as colleges are curtailing and canceling football and other fall sports. Former coach, the great Lou Holtz is here to tell us why losing football is devastating for the American psyche.But first, \"Biden's America Last Campaign,\" that's the focus of \"Tonight's Angle.\" Joe Biden's campaign must obviously not be too confident in the polls, showing him up over the President, because if he was really confident why would he attempt a policy makeover this late in the campaign? Why would a guy who has been one of the worst apologists for globalism suddenly try to out Trump, Trump, by selling himself as a passionate believer in America first populism?(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOE BIDEN, D-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We're going to double this foreign tax -- the tax on foreign profits, so we don't encourage people to leave. I do not accept the defeat as you that forecast that automatic -- automation and globalization mean we can't keep well paid jobs here in America and create more of them. I do not buy it for one second, the vitality of American manufacturing is the thing of the past.(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM: Now, where have heard that before? Donald Trump. Well, Biden suddenly mimicking him, because his handlers know it's a huge weak spot. They know that in order to win, he's going to need some of that blue-collar love from voters in Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Wisconsin.Now, don't forget that according to RealClearPolitics, voters still approve of President Trump's handling the economy. So Joe's team, they decided that he should say something about the economy, don't you think other than promising to lock it down. Now, of course, he has nothing to say. He had almost 50 years to build a record on economic issues, and he utterly failed.So like the rest of his campaign, Biden's economic claims are just another act. They're sleight of hand. Based on his campaign's view that most Americans aren't that smart, and that the press, of course, will provide cover for all of his mistakes.Now, after all, this is the same guy who voted for one bad trade deal after another, including both NAFTA in that catastrophic decision to normalize trade relations with China. Now, that colossal mistake of a bill, not only fast-tracked China's nation -- China's entry into the WTO, but it also gutted American industry, and it destroyed millions of American jobs.Well, I forget almost that Biden was a vocal supporter of the Trans-Pacific Partnership. That was a deal that was so bad even Hillary Clinton could not defend it. She backed away from it. Now, to be fair to Biden, he probably didn't think too hard about any of these votes.After all, he's a Senator from Delaware -- he was, where lots of multinational companies get their charters, and he's probably just doing as he was told. Just like he'll do if he gets in the White House.Now, you think that a guy with almost five decades of political experience, would be proud to tout his record, but not Joe Biden. After decades of doing whatever the globalist wanted and pushing for policies and treaties that gutted American jobs and drove down wages. He wants you to believe that now at the age of almost 80, he's finally seen the error of his ways. At long last, he'll abandon the Clinton-Obama internationalist playbook.So all of a sudden he trundles over to scrim and read this speech designed to make it sound like someone who really cares about American workers. The whole charade is absurd on its face. It's basically an insult to our intelligence. Democrats have told us time and again, what they really think of saving key American industries.Now remember, he was Vice President for eight years, the Democrats had plenty of time to revise NAFTA, stand up to China and push policies that would lead to higher wages. They didn't do any of that. Instead, they promoted exactly the same type of outsourcing policies that the Bushes and the Clintons pushed, and Biden was with them every step of the way. So you want to know what Joe and his party really think of American workers, listen to them in their own words.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BIDEN: Anybody could go down 300 to 3,000 feet in the mind, sure in hell can learn how to program as well. Anybody can throw coal into a furnace, can learn how to program for god sake/HILLARY CLINTON, FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE: We're going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business.BARACK OBAMA, FORMER PRESIDENT: Some of those jobs of the past are just not going to come back.(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM: Maybe he's going to wave his magic wand. Oh, who's going to be able to renegotiate these deals? Obama said. Well, Trump was. Now, why am I not surprised that people who despise America would also despise American workers? Thank God, Trump never believed that defeat is nonsense. Trump didn't just promise to revise NAFTA, he got new provisions in it that would make it harder to ship auto jobs to Mexico.And he didn't just promise to stand up to China. He whacked them with tariffs for their cheating. And he didn't just promise to resist international bureaucrats, he shut down the WTO's Dispute Settlement system in response to its obvious anti-American bias.So is Joe Biden likely to continue fighting for American workers in the same way? Of course, not. Don't make me laugh, OK. I'm already laughing through his speech today. The moment the first Canadian or European bureaucrat raises an eyebrow, the moment the first member of the press asked a hard question, the moment the first CEO gets Biden on the phone, his administration will cave and the outsourcing party begins again.Of course, all of this will help the rich. Big hedge funds will be thrilled. They're desperate for the days of easy returns by selling out to the CCP, and Biden's just their man. Look at it this way. If Joe were truly a made in the USA kind of guy, would a guy like Mike Bloomberg be supporting him?Ignore the happy talk and the fake blue-collar events. To understand Biden's real agenda, we don't have to look any further than the 110-page document released yesterday, a joint product of the Biden campaign and the Bernie Bros. I prefer to call it Biden's roadmap to ruin.Now, a climate task force will push for a Green New Deal and calls for the U.S. to rejoin the Paris Accord. Leading the effort will be those well- known nationalists, John Kerry and AO.C Say goodbye to the U.S. energy sector, my friends, too bad Texas, tough luck, Pennsylvania.Then the criminal justice task force, that will boast an impressive roster of big thinkers, including Senator Biden aide, Symone Sanders. \"The Washington Post\" described her as someone who pushed the campaign to be wary of language that frustrates black activists, urging staffers to avoid the term white working class.Mr. Fast and Furious himself, former Obama AG Eric Holder, also took part. Well, their demands are a law enforcement nightmare. Federal use of force standards, making it easier to sue police, national registry of police officers who abuse power -- whatever that means, repealing mandatory minimums, expunging all past convictions for pot and juvenile criminal activities, no prison time at all for failure to pay fines for child support, no cash bail, and appointing activist judges -- that'll be a varsity sport.So there's a lot in there that's great for Tony Soprano and his crew maybe, but nothing for law abiding citizens. To Biden in this team, that's what you get for liking America. Of course, such an array of radical ideas is only going to ensure more racial injustice.And isn't that you are trying many of these same proposals about the police and defunding them as we speak? And look what's happening there. We have massive police retirements, massive crime, the President talked about it tonight. People with money are leaving New York City in droves. So imagine those policies of Bill de Blasio coming to a neighborhood near you? Well, unlike Biden, Trump doesn't have to pretend to believe in America first. He's already proven it.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: It was always, yes, China will catch America. We took in tens of billions of dollars in tariffs that they paid for.Our immigration system is stretched far beyond the breaking point. To confront this national security crisis, I declared a national emergency.Many emergency declarations have been used to protect people in faraway nations. Now we are protecting, finally, our people.-- add that under my administration, we've delivered $1.5 billion for public charter schools. That's a record.(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM: Now watching Biden, on the other hand, trying to pretend to care about, oh, the schools, the kids, the blue-collar workers, it's almost a repellent. Almost every action in his career and of his party now, and virtually everything that Democrat Party wants today, represents an attack on the middle class -- traditional American families, working Americans.Team Biden will ship your jobs to china and lock you in your homes. They'd shut down churches and schools, they'd let rioters loot and burn, they'd punish the police and free the criminals. This November pay no attention to empty Democrat promises about all the free stuff they're finally going to give you. I've been listening to those promises my whole life. If they had any meaning, we'd all be on Easy Street by now.Remember the jobs we lost to China, the storefronts destroyed by the riots, the cops threatened and humiliated by Left Wing nuts, the kids who still can't go to school. That's the real Democratic Party, and they're coming for you. And that's \"The Angle.\"Joining me now is Larry Kudlow, White House economic adviser. Larry, good to see you tonight. If Biden was serious about empowering American workers, he did the big populist push today. Why didn't he actually do that during his 40 plus years in DC?LARRY KUDLOW, NATIONAL ECONOMIC COUNCIL DIRECTOR: Well, it's good point. He had his chance, particularly with Obama, last eight years before President Trump. We had one of the worst recoveries in history.Look, you go down the list and look at that campaign document, first of all, he intends to repeal every tax cut that President Trump put in to rejuvenate the economy. And let me make this point, despite the mantra of the Democrats that all tax cuts help the rich.The Trump tax cuts did exactly what we hoped. That is, middle income, blue collar workers, lower wage earners performed the best, not only with the lowest unemployment rate in history, but their wage increase was faster than the top 1 percent. And the unemployment rates for African Americans and Hispanics and Asians and women were at historic lows.Plus, Biden's going to add new taxes, today he said by the way. He does want to have the stock market. He doesn't want to have shareholders involved in the stock market. Well, besides pension funds, and even union pension funds 51 percent are invested in the stock market, which I might add is up 40 percent since the laws.He's going to rewrite all of the regulatory reductions that President Trump put in to help small businesses --INGRAHAM: Oh, it's going to be a nightmare.KUDLOW: --to hire workers.INGRAHAM: Nightmare.KUDLOW: He's for the Green New Deal, which will -- and he can talk about coal mines all he wants. But if you go with the Green New Deal, that means all fossil fuels gone.INGRAHAM: Well, it's Biden energy sector.KUDLOW: It will have an incredibly negative effect on the economy.INGRAHAM: Larry, let me get in here. Let me get in here, because I think what Biden sees, obviously, he's had a disadvantage in arguing these points. It's obvious. His whole career speaks to internationalism and exporting jobs to china.But he also can say now, because you all have and done it, I'm going to bring back drug manufacturing. I'm going to do this. Trump says he was going to do it from China. I'm going to do it. Why hasn't the Trump administration moved on that order? I know Peter Navarro and others have been pushing. It was reported today. Why are we not bringing back some of these drugs and bringing them back stat, to use a medical term.KUDLOW: Well, but that's exactly what we're trying to do. Not only pharmaceuticals, but semiconductors --INGRAHAM: Well, what's holding it up?KUDLOW: --retailers. Well, there's nothing holding it up. We are -- when we come out with our program, we're already in discussion with lots of companies based in China. We had a discussion today. A leading semiconductor company is selling their factories in China and coming back home. We will give them the lowest corporate tax rates, we will give them perhaps tax credits, certainly 100 percent expensing. We may use some government funds to pay for their moving costs.We have a whole campaign planned. We're warning American investors not to invest in Chinese stocks because of the fraudulent accounting. Robert O'Brien and I have already warned, the Thrift Savings Plan and the Railroad Retirement Fund. So we are doing exactly that. And we're taking steps to deal with this Hong Kong disaster. So I don't think it's right to say we haven't done it. We've been doing it.And the tax reform itself, we made it so easy to repatriate profits and capital come back to the United States. In a second Trump term, you'll see a lot more of that.INGRAHAM: And so we -- you can commit tonight that we will bring back these crucial drugs and the manufacturing, even if the price goes up a little bit at home, in order to secure our stockpile of critical medications?KUDLOW: I think, Laura, that we learned -- not the only country, other countries. But United States learned that China is not to be trusted, period, full stop. And that we cannot rely on these long-complicated supply chains coming out of China. I think you'll see the whole business community.You don't see business school professors saying now the supply chains don't work. We got to bring it back home, because China is not reliable. They're not the only ones who are unreliable. But I hear the same thing for people around the world, so that's going to be a major change.But we have got to continue low taxes and deregulation and fair-trade deals. If we do that, we will come through this pandemic, I think we're going to get 20 percent growth in the second half. Hopefully, the virus hotspots will be subdued and mitigated, and I think we're going to have a big bang in 2021.We were coming into this strong, you know that. The tax cuts worked, deregulation worked, the energy worked, the trade worked.INGRAHAM: In real short --KUDLOW: We just had the USMCA. We just had the USMCA. President Obrador was here. A lot of goodwill. That's(CROSSTALK)INGRAHAM: Larry, real quick --KUDLOW: --percentage points to GDP.INGRAHAM: Real quick. Isn't it really important that people understand, comparing our response to COVID to Europe's response, our economy is faring far better than the major European countries. I don't think a lot of voters know that. But when you look at the charts, it's undeniable. Trump's policies, post COVID are working economically. Biden wants to turn that back by locking us all down as do those Democrat mayors. Real quick, Larry.KUDLOW: Well, we -- look, we have a strong V shaped recovery. There's some recovery in Europe, by the way, but we do have a strong recovery. Let me just say this in closing.I am concerned about the virus hotspots -- and I will say this. If you want to reopen our economy, if you want to let the President rebuild our economy for the second time, the best thing we can do is take the safety measures, use the face mask. The President said that tonight with Sean. Keep the distancing. The testing is so important in the hotspots and personal hygiene. If you practice that, then we will stabilize the hotspots and we will be off to the races in a strong economy. That's where we started, and it can continue.INGRAHAM: Larry great to see it. Tonight, thanks so much for joining us.And American cities are already getting a preview of what life will be like under the Biden administration. Angry mobs burning down businesses, defacing monuments. Of course, we see the rampant crime, and all-out assault on police by the people who are supposed to be leading the people and keeping them safe. It'll only get worse if Biden wins.Joining me now Bernie Kerik, former NYPD Commissioner. Bernie, you've heard me in \"The Angle.\" No cash bail, no prison for not paying child support. I don't need to repeat the whole thing. This is what Biden's plan is. What will that mean for Americans streets, neighborhoods, communities?BERNARD KERIK, FORMER NYPD COMMISSIONER: Chaos. Chaos, violent crime, murder. We already know in every one of the Democratic cities around the country. The major cities like Chicago and Baltimore and Milwaukee, Minnesota, places like that. They're already the highest crime -- the highest violent crime, the highest murder rates. It's only going to get worse.This diminishing, defunding the police departments is going to create mass chaos. We're seeing it right here with the reductions that this mayor has already started on reducing the street crime units, the plainclothes units.INGRAHAM: Well, the NYPD, Bernie, is seeing this disturbing mass exodus. \"National Review\" said that 179 cops filed for retirement between June 29th and Monday, a 411 percent increase over the 35 who filed during the same period last year. So this is exactly what the Black Lives Matter and the radical left want to see happen, right? Drive police out of the streets, drive police off the force and demoralize the population, so they just say, OK, I'll vote for Biden to make it stop, I guess.KERIK: And that's what the mayor did today. By standing on Fifth Avenue, drawing that mural for Black Lives Matter, knowing that this is a trained Marxist group, that they were inspired by a domestic terrorists convicted of killing a cop, that they've called for the murders of cops, that they've yelled and chant, \"pigs in a blanket, fry like bacon,\" \"the only good cops are dead cops.\"They're responsible for all the riots in 44 states, 76 cities around the country that injured 500 cops. He's out there painting that mural. You know what that says to every New York City cop? I despise you. I despise you.And he himself -- and I got to remind people of this. He is no better than the founders of Black Lives Matter, the Marxist. He himself is a Marxist. If you go back to 1987 when he was 26 years old. He was the guy standing out there saying Nicaragua's troubles are my troubles too, supporting the Sandinistas. He's a lunatic. He should not be in office.INGRAHAM: Well, New York -- I mean, will New York ever wake up or is this the city they want? Because everyone I know is leaving New York. Bernie. It's a complete disgrace. Thank you for your words of wisdom tonight.And the media was downright giddy about the Supreme Court's ruling on Trump's tax returns. But they were wrong. They shouldn't be. Our legal Eagles will explain why this actually might be a huge political victory for Trump. You bet. Stay there.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)ARI MELBER, MSNBC CHIEF LEGAL CORRESPONDENT: A big loss for President Trump here.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I find this to be a very dark day for Donald Trump. This is his greatest fear.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: If he doesn't win reelection, he is potentially going to see a criminal indictment as a private person.NEAL KATYAL, FORMER FEDERAL PROSECUTOR: I'm Donald Trump. I am scared right now.(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM: It's scary that the guy was the Solicitor General of the United States. Well, the truth is that one of the rulings today completely destroyed Congress's gross unconstitutional overstep in trying to obtain Trump's tax returns.So yes, the High Court did rule that the Manhattan D.A. Cyrus Vance could subpoena the tax documents. But it's not the stirring victory the Left would have you believe. You actually have to read the opinions.Now, first, the case was remanded back to the lower court, where Trump's lawyers can make more constitutional arguments to draw up the case. And second, even if a court expedites its decision, the tax returns would go to a grand jury, meaning they'll still be secret.Now, in fact, the Manhattan D.A. may not see the President's tax returns for many more months or many more years. This is just harassment, come on. In other words, there's almost zero chance that Trump's taxes become public before the November election.Joining me now is John Eastman, Claremont Institute Senior Fellow, Constitutional Scholar; also Sol Wisenberg, former deputy independent counsel. So you say this isn't really the win that Vance in New York thinks it is, why?SOL WISENBERG, DEP WHITEWATER INDEPENDENT COUNSEL: Well, even though President Trump and the DOJ lost on their overall legal argument. Remember, all the court said was that the President does not have absolute immunity from state criminal processes.But that's kind of a theoretical question, Laura, they then send it back to the lower courts, as you say, and President Trump is free to say all right. But in this particular instance, this subpoena is a problem. This subpoena, for example, is nothing but a retaliatory effort to interfere with my executive powers.They're still free to make any argument they want with respect to the particular subpoena. Why was it issued at this particular time? Why do you want my -- why exactly do you need these tax returns? So, yes, they lost on their legal points, which I don't think most people thought they were going to win on anyway. But as a practical matter, I think it's a win, certainly in the short term.INGRAHAM: John, your thoughts on this. This seems like this opens the door in a way for any rogue, State AG or DA to harass the President of the United States anytime they have an ideological dispute, not to impart bad motives on all Democrat DAs. But it certainly opens up a can of worms down the road for other Presidents, perhaps.JOHN EASTMAN, CLAREMONT INSTITUTE SENIOR FELLOW: Well, it does open it up perhaps. But I agree with Sol, and that's not what -- I mean, I was watching the news today and wondered whether the news reports were reading the same opinion I was reading. I mean, I think the Chief Justice, and the and the large majority of the court went out of its way to try and prevent that kind of rogue district attorney from harassing the President.He said the entire the entire conduct of the proceeding needs to be conducted with the fact that this is the President of United States and the Office of Chief Executive in mind. And it specifically says that the President can challenge these subpoenas as an attempt to influence the performance of his duties that would violate the supremacy clause.And so, you don't have absolute immunity from the subpoena, but we're not going to allow witch hunts for partisan political gain against a sitting president or a presidential candidate. And I think the court made clear on that.So I don't think this is a win for Vance at all. The Second Circuit decision was affirmed, and that just means the president doesn't have absolute immunity, but the things that are handed to him are more than enough to force him having to disclose.INGRAHAM: Got it. Sol, I want to move on to John Durham, because there's so many people waiting for the results of his investigation, but FOX News is reporting exclusively that Durham does not want this to be viewed politically, and the closer it gets to November, Durham could punt it until after the election. Sol, if this report is delayed until after election, it's never going to the light of day, we might not ever know what was really down to the president or what nefarious efforts were undertaken at the FBI and beyond.WISENBERG: First of all, we don't know that there's going to be a report. He's not a report, he's not a special counsel. He may just tell the story in any indictments that get issued. I would also say there's a considerable amount of time between an election if the president loses and the following term.But listen, I have a lot of faith in Durham. He's got a sterling reputation. And as Attorney General Barr said -- first of all, Attorney General Barr said he doesn't think there is even going to be in an investigation, a criminal investigation of former President Obama or President Biden. If you take those two out of the equation, as Barr said, who are we going to be looking that is going to be running for office? Nobody. So I don't really -- I'll believe it when I see it. I think Durham is being methodical. He doesn't want anyone to say that this is political on his part, and given his reputation, I don't think they will.INGRAHAM: John, really quickly, your reaction to the shocking decision by Federal District Judge Emmet Sullivan to refuse to dismiss the case against Flynn. He is now asking the appeals court en banc to rule about whether to keep the Flynn case alive. John, real quick.EASTMAN: Did he not get the basic separation of powers thing? He doesn't get to bring motions to another court. He's not the party in the case. He doesn't get to appoint his own prosecutor. He is supposed to be the judge. This is just getting laughable. But I hope the en banc circuit, D.C. circuit will slap it down, and slap the judge down too, rather than just the case.INGRAHAM: If you can sanction the judge in this case, I would be all for that. This is a travesty. We've got to roll. Guys, thanks so much.And despite the fact that college aged students are extremely low risk as the task force said yesterday, various leagues now have already started canceling their sports in the fall. Legendary former Notre Dame coach Lou Holtz is here next. Why canceling football is not just ignoring science but could actually crush the American spirit. Stay there.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)INGRAHAM: I was thinking about this today, what we are in the middle of here, it kind of amounts to a war against our way of life. Because after the riots subsided and it became clear that the U.S. economy was improving, and improving really rapidly under President Trump's policies, I think the left and started to freak out a little bit. Can't have all those people working at having fun again. So how could they keep the panic and anxiety going to ensure a Biden victory?(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Dr. Fauci says the United States is knee-deep in the crisis.DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES: I think any state that is having a serious problem, that state should seriously look at shutting down.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Look how steep that curve is, and you think the only way now to change that is to shut down?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We're not dropping cases in our immunity with tests and trace and masking, then yes.(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM: Deaths are going down, cases are going up, so no fun for America.OK, now, a few states of course have seen the rise in positive cases, but again, the daily death rate has been dropping like a rock since peaking in April. This is actually good news. We're getting closer to herd immunity in some sectors of the United States. We also have T cell immunity, talked about that the other night. So it's a serious disease, especially, though, for the old and vulnerable. Most people do quite well with it under the age of 25, most people will be fine, again, with some rare exceptions. Kids who are college aged and younger, what about them?(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DR. DEBORAH BIRX, WHITE HOUSE CORONAVIRUS RESPONSE COORDINATOR: We know that mortality rate in under 25 from the CDC data is less than 0.1 percent.We have no evidence that there is significant mortality in children without coexisting diseases.(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM: So despite this extremely low risk for young people with COVID, colleges around the country seem to be rushing into the fearmongering stage, the panic stage. And the left seems to enjoy this moment where sports seems to be ending.Now yesterday, the Ivy League announced it would cancel all sports in the fall, including football. Just how big a deal is this? Yale won't be playing Princeton or Harvard for the first time since World War II. As expected, the dominoes continue to fall. From there, the Big Ten said today it wouldn't allow any out of conference games for football or any other sport, citing these unprecedented times. But at the end of the day, the commissioner couldn't even promise that.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)KEVIN WARREN, BIG TEN COMMISSIONER: One thing we have to realize is that this is not a fait accompli that we're going to have sports in the fall. We may not have sports in the fall. We may not have a college football season in the Big Ten.(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM: Well, this mindset isn't just taking over colleges, it's trickling down the high schools well. Superintendent of Dallas public schools, have some good football teams there, made this stunning announcement today.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MICHAEL HINOJOSA, DALLAS INDEPENDENT SCHOOL DISTRICT SUPERINTENDENT: I seriously doubt it. I don't know. We're not in control of that. The university interscholastically gives us guidance on that. But that's a true contact sport. I don't know how we can pull it off. There's been some discussion of moving it to the spring, but we'll have to wait and see. I seriously doubt we can pull it off.(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM: Because there is no inherent risk in playing football. The kids don't out there and put their health at risk just playing the sport. Specifically, one of the greatest coaches of all time is Lou Holtz, Notre Dame Hall of Fame coach. Lou, I'm so glad you're here tonight. I say this kind of feels like a war on American life. No church, no singing, no school, no football. Where does it end?LOU HOLTZ, FOOTBALL ANALYST: I think it ends when we have the election. When you're in a leadership role, Laura, you have to look at things from both points of view. As a coach I'd look at it from a player's point of view as well as from a coach's point of view. The way it is right now, they just don't want to have sports, and there's no way in this world you can do anything in this world without a risk. People stormed Normandy. I took some grandchildren over there. They knew there was going to be casualties, they knew there was going to be risk, but it was a way of life.Now if you eliminate all nonconference games, first of all, you have seven teams in the Big Ten that schedule four patsies so they know they're going to win four games, with two conference games, they can go to the bowl. That ain't going to happen. But let me tell you the devastating effect it's going to have is then the nonpower five schools, my son is head coach at Louisiana Tech. He used to play Baylor, Vanderbilt, those are money games, those are very, very important. But how are you going to have football when they don't even want to have school? Some schools like Notre Dame has said, OK, we're going to start on August 10th. Now some of faculty members say, oh, it's too risky, I don't want to go. You have teachers' unions saying you shouldn't go back to school. The underprivileged, the people from the poor neighborhoods, where they going to get education? What has happened to our way of life? Look at it from both points of view. The risk is always there, but you cannot just look at it from one side, and that's exactly what's happening. And I think it will end on Election Day.INGRAHAM: Lou, it seems to me that there are a lot of people on the left especially who have wanted to get rid of football for some time. All the op-eds about, of course it's a dangerous sport, it's a brutal sport, it's a misogynistic sport. Football has been trashed by the left for a couple of decades. So you get the sense that they think they have football right where they want it. But Notre Dame, Alabama, even some of those Ivy League schools, the Pac 10, Ohio, the Buckeyes, they all want to play football. When are we going to hear from coaches and players who say let us assume the risk? We'll assume the risk, let our players play. Are we going to hear from any of them or no?HOLTZ: I don't think so, but if I were coaching I would sure speak up. I've had people say I don't want my son to play football so I'm going to go buy him a motorcycle so he'll have something to do other than football.I want to tell you, Laura. I can't begin to tell you the lessons people learn in football. It's a microcosm of life. You learn about sacrifice, you learn about teamwork, getting along with other people. You learn to work on your skills to make sacrifices, to make a total commitment to other people for the welfare of the overall team and unit. There is so many valuable lessons you learn from it, and when you are part of a team, people want to be part of something. That is how games came about. When they started emphasizing athletics in schools, then people started enjoying the game, because young people wanted to be part of something, and you are that away from them?INGRAHAM: Coach, I want to quickly get to your view on the now push to get Notre Dame to reconsider the Fighting Irish nickname. OK, as a former coach at Notre Dame, what are your thoughts on that? Apparently, that is now politically incorrect.HOLTZ: I think that's ridiculous. They were named the Fighting Irish because the Ku Klux Klan tried to attack the Catholics. They went down and fought the Ku Klux Klan, and that is where the name the Fighting Irish came. Now day you're going to tell me they want to topple my statue Notre Dame. That is when I will really get mad.INGRAHAM: Coach Holtz, before we go, on behalf of all of us at \"The Ingraham Angle,\" I want to express our great condolences for your incredible wife, the lovely Beth. I know you were married for 58 years. She was an amazing woman, and I know it just hurts in your heart, and we heard for you, coach.HOLTZ: Thank you, Laura. If I could make one comment, we had the funeral at Notre Dame Basilica, there couldn't be many people, but we have gotten so many thousands of texts and emails. I wish they had done it when she was alive. So everybody listen, please sit down while somebody's still living and tell them the difference they made in your life. Do it while they can appreciate it. Thank you.INGRAHAM: Lou, we will, and you have made a huge difference to so many players and alumni and students and me, personally, over the years. So thank you so much for everything you do. We really appreciate it.HOLTZ: Thank you. Now I have to watch your program alone. And I enjoy your program, but it will be sad.INGRAHAM: Thanks so much, Lou.HOLTZ: Thank you.INGRAHAM: And being a medical professional who tells the truth about COVID figures gets you smeared professionally, ostracized, even targeted by medical boards. Two men who found themselves in that position at times are here with their stories, next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)INGRAHAM: For challenging the medical establishment, may be the medical deep state, and exposing a massive flaw in our COVID response, my next two guests have found themselves on the wrong side of that medical mafia. Here now is Dr. Scott Jensen, physician, Minnesota state senator, and Dr. Stephen Smith, founder of the Smith Center for Infectious Diseases and Urban Health. Dr. Jensen, you found legitimate flaws in the CDC's guidelines. Now you're being targeted by your state's health board. Explain briefly.DR. SCOTT JENSEN, PHYSICIAN: Basically, I'm being told that because I questioned the Department of Health and the CDC's communications that I've been spreading misinformation. I think this is ludicrous. If you want to know who is spreading misinformation, if the governor comes out and tells Minnesotans they are going to have 74,000 deaths and then later on reduces it to 29,000 deaths, and then later on gives us another statistic and says in mid-July, which is next week, we're going to have 1,000 deaths per day, to me that would be more misinformation than me saying hey, listen, death certificates are a serious thing and we should be doing it right.INGRAHAM: Dr. Smith, you've turned into a pariah of sorts by your own hospital because of your advocacy for and use of, successfully, I might add, hydroxychloroquine. Tell us about it.DR. STEPHEN SMITH, SMITH CENTER OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES: In the beginning when I adopted the French regimen, which was 600 milligrams a day, as opposed to the 2,400 milligrams lower dose that people were using, CDC, actually the FDA eventually endorsed, I got immediate pushback from the CMO at one of the hospitals we go to. Immediate. Like, we'll take it from here, Stephen, after I sent them the article. I said, what? He came in on a Saturday and I was still in the hospital working my tail off, and I said, no, you won't touch my patients.And since then, I don't know why -- I didn't know I was creating controversy. I thought I was following the data like I always do. And it's a safe drug, a cheap drug. And I got in another argument with the CMO of the system. He said, if we give everybody 600 milligrams a day, which is only 6,000, as opposed to 2,400 milligrams, we're going to run out of hydroxychloroquine. I said I don't believe him. He hung up on me. That was after maybe I had spent three hours taking care of 50 of his patients.INGRAHAM: Earlier today, earlier today Dr. Fauci was asked if we can control COVID without a vaccine. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES: I think we can get it under control but keeping it under control is going to be the real problem. This virus, to our dismay, is spectacularly efficient in transmitting from person to person. That makes me skeptical whether we would get permanent, sustained control of this without having a vaccine.(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM: OK, Dr. Jensen. The translation -- get ready to be locked down until Biden is elected. I'm sorry, I hear that, and my blood boils. It is a virus, it's a bad virus, but most people do fine with it. Could this be with us forever? And vaccines aren't 100 percent useful anyway, in most cases.JENSEN: I would ask Dr. Fauci why in the world he would use the word \"spectacularly.\" That sounds like just fearmongering. And I would ask, what RNA viruses have we been successful at in terms of creating a vaccine that really does what we want? We know that with our influenza vaccine, we frequently face just terribly mediocre results. And if you look at other coronavirus viruses, whether you're talking about SARS or MERS, we don't have a great track record. So the fact of the matter is, if a vaccine comes along to help us, that's great, but we are far more realistically leaning into herd immunity.INGRAHAM: Yes, the Henry Ford Health System study on hydroxy has come under fire. Not only was the study not randomized, outside experts noting the patients who received hydroxy were also more likely to get steroids. Dr. Smith, you've read the study, you've treated all these patients successfully. What are your thoughts?SMITH: It's really hard to -- actually it's harder to show something works than doesn't work. And obviously we've had several trials showing this drug or drug combination works very well. Our data support that. There are many other trials that show that. And when you see efficacy, you really take notice, because, again, it's harder to prove something works in this situation then to say it's neutral. It's a lot easier to say he doesn't have an effect for a bunch of reasons.INGRAHAM: And it's a generic drug and it doesn't cause $4,000 a course like remdesivir. Gentlemen, thank you so much. Great to see you.An important Last Bite, next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BAIER: A policy of never-ending lockdowns month after month would ultimately do more harm than good to public health, and so bad for our children. As a result, it really is more loss of life. We can't do that. We have to get back now. We did it right. We saved millions of lives by what we did.(END VIDEO CLIP)", "comment": "", "topic": "TRANSCRIPT", "date": " July 9"}, {"cover": "https://a57.foxnews.com/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/694940094001/11a65d5f-f6ce-4b56-8403-b0e419935747/02f89279-7ae5-47a3-b04b-06e45839c581/1280x720/match/156/88/image.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "title": "Richmond mayor orders Confederate statues on city land removed", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/transcript/richmond-mayor-orders-confederate-statues-on-city-land-removed", "subtitle": "Jul 1, 2020 ...

Breaking tonight, President Trump dismisses the stories about intelligence assessments that Russia offered bounties for killing American troops in Afghanistan as a hoax and made up to hurt him and the Republican Party. The President's National Security Adviser is saying today he had a list of retaliatory options if the intelligence had been corroborated. I will ask Secretary of State Mike Pompeo about this story, many other topics around the world in just a few minutes. But first to the lead story from the White House tonight, we begin tonight with Correspondent Kristin Fisher live on the North Lawn. Good evening, Kristin. KRISTIN FISHER, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT: Good evening, Bret. Today for the first time since The New York Times broke the story on Friday, President Trump talked about it on camera and he said if Russia did offer bounties to kill U.S. troops in Afghanistan, he would take action. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I agree with the intelligence people. I think frankly that many of the intelligence people didn't think it was something that even happened. And if it did happen, the Russians would hear about it, and anybody else would hear about it that was involved. FISHER: Today the National Security Adviser confirmed that the intelligence behind to these Russian bounties was shared with U.S. allies. And he pinned the responsibility for the decision to not share that intelligence with President Trump on the President's daily briefer, a career CIA officer. ROBERT O'BRIEN, NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER: She made that decision because she didn't have confidence in the intelligence that came up. She made that call and you know what? I think she made the right call. FISHER: But Democrats disagree. They believe intelligence of this magnitude should have made its way to the president. (INAUDIBLE) as The New York Times and associated press recording, then Democratic Senator Joe Manchin says, not only did the president, quote, fail our service members, but he broke his oath to protect and defend the constitution. It would be unconscionable to think he did not immediately inform Putin that America would retaliate in the most damning way possible. The New York Times is now claiming to have found the money trail behind these bounties to kill U.S. troops in Afghanistan. The paper reports, American officials intercepted electronic data showing large financial transfers from a bank account controlled by Russia's military intelligence agency to a Taliban-linked account. But Defense Secretary Mark Esper says, the Pentagon has no corroborating evidence at this time. Adding, I want to assure all of our service members that we take seriously any and all potential threats against U.S. military personnel. Today, Democratic Senator Bob Menendez introduced an amendment to the Defense Authorization Act to sanction Russian President Vladimir Putin and other top government officials. But the Kremlin calls the claims total B.S. and so does President Trump. TRUMP: I think it's a hoax by the newspapers and the Democrats. (END VIDEOTAPE) FISHER: Now lawmakers from both parties have been calling for a briefing about all of this from people within the intelligence community, not the White House. And tomorrow morning, the Gang of Eight is going to get one from the director of National Intelligence and the director of the CIA, Bret. BAIER: Yes, and the Secretary of State with us in just a moment. Kristin, thank you. The House of Representatives passed a bill to sanction China over their new national security law for Hong Kong. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi saying the purpose of that law is to frighten and suppress peaceful demonstrators demanding freedom. Thousands of protesters defied the law and tear gas on the anniversary of the former British colonies handover to Chinese rule. Hong Kong police responded with the first arrests under the new law. Correspondent Benjamin Hall is following this story from London. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BENJAMIN HALL, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT: Hong Kong police cracked down today both on protesters and free speech. Police fired rubber bullets as they enforce the new security law which gives sweeping powers to China to arrest people for criticizing the government. As crowds marks 23 years since the end of British rule, police held up signs warning of the new law then arrested people who called for Hong Kong independence, or even displayed the British flag. The law is applied to nonresidents and those abroad, meaning it could affect Americans. Carrie Lam, the Chief Executive of Hong Kong tried to defend it. CARRIE LAM, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF HONG KONG: The purpose of this piece of legislation is not just to punish, but it's also to deter. HALL: The U.S. is responding by moving to end special trade terms with Hong Kong and banning defense exports. With Congress moving to impose sanctions on Chinese officials who try to repress political freedoms. The U.K. is extending residency rights and citizenship to up to three million Hong Kongers. And British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has condemned the law. BORIS JOHNSON, PRIME MINISTER OF THE UNITED KINGDOM: It violates Hong Kong's high degree of autonomy and is in direct conflict with Hong Kong basic law. The laws also threatens the freedoms and rights protected by the joint declaration. HALL: The new law is punishable by up to life in Chinese prison. And China will now be allowed to establish security officers in Hong Kong, which means Chinese security forces operating freely on the island. (END VIDEOTAPE) HALL: Observe this note, this new law is a violation of the agreement made with Britain. Effectively the end of the one country, two-systems framework. The end of Hong Kong's autonomy, Bret. BAIER: Benjamin Hall in London. Benjamin, thank you. Federal authorities seized tons of products suspected to be made out of human hair taken from people locked inside Chinese internment camp. U.S. Customs and Border Protection says the goods represent a serious human rights violation. State Department Correspondent Rich Edson has an exclusive television report. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) RICH EDSON, FOX NEWS CHANNEL STATE DEPARTMENT CORRESPONDENT: In this nearly 13-ton shipment seized in New York, hair weaves and extensions from China. The U.S. officials suspect they're made from human hair. Customs official say they're still analyzing the origins of this cargo, though intercepted it based on information indicating prison labor in Xinjiang, China produced it. KEN CUCCINELLI, ACTING DEPUTY SECRETARY, DHS: It is our intention to keep interdicting shipments like the one you saw today in New York that CBP grabbed. We will keep doing that over and over and over. No American wants to buy a product that they find out later was made with slave labor. EDSON: The spokesman for the National Security Council says, quote, if this highly suspicious, 13-ton shipment of human hair indeed turns out to be linked to the Uyghur concentration camps, then this is a new low, even for the Chinese Communist Party. And they will have to answer to the world community for their actions. Officials say the administration is expanding pressure on businesses operating in the United States, urging them to rid their supply chains of products manufactured with forced labor. The federal government has issued an advisory to companies, warning them to monitor their activities in China. MIKE POMPEO, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: CEOs should read this notice closely and be aware of the reputational, economic and legal risks of supporting such assaults on human dignity. EDSON: The notice specifically references Xinjiang, China where officials say the Chinese government has interned more than one million Muslims and minorities like Uyghurs. Subjecting them to surveillance, indoctrination, and forced labor. Last month, President Trump told Axios he held off on sanctioning Chinese officials involved with the Xinjiang mass detention camps because it would have interfered with his trade deal with China. (END VIDEOTAPE) EDSON: But the president has also signed a law directing sanctions against Chinese government officials who were involved in the mass internment camps in Xinjiang. U.S. officials say that Chinese government has located hundreds of thousands of prisoners from those camps to factories across China, Bret. BAIER: Rich Edson live from the state department. Rich, thank you. For more on China, Hong Kong and America's role in the world, joining me now Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Mr. Secretary, thanks for being here. POMPEO: Bret, thanks for having me on this evening. Great to be with you again. BAIER: We just heard you talked about the companies -- American companies warning them to keep forced labor, labor out of their supply chains pointing directly at China and these concentration camps as descried by the Defense Department. Will we see investigations and prosecutions of American businesses who don't heed this warning? POMPEO: Bret, President Trump has been very clear, the way previous administrations have dealt with the Chinese Communist Party by turning the other cheek and letting them abuse America is not going to continue, so we responded across a number of fronts. So you identify one, this forced labor, nobody wants to buy products -- cheap products that were made with slave labor in Western China. They want clarity about the tracing of the product that they have. And so we've asked every business to evaluate their supply chain and make sure that nothing like that ever gets in, and we put them on notice for actions that we may take as we move forward. BAIER: You know, last month, President Trump told Axios that he held off sanctions -- sanctioning Chinese officials involved with the mass detention camps because it would have interfered with his trade deal with China. Should those have been separated? POMPEO: Bret, I've been Secretary of State for 2-1/2 years, no, there's always complex tradeoffs that one has to make. President Trump's been very clear when he signed this bill, the Uyghur bill last week that we were going to take this seriously, we were going to deal with it, we were going to put harsh restrictions in place, we're working on that. No country has responded in the same way that we have. We hope the whole world will join. What's going on there Bret, is historic, there's forced sterilization, forcing women to have abortions, this is a place with some of the most fundamental violations of human rights that the world has seen in an awfully long time. President Trump's been serious about making sure the world sees. And so we hope that countries all across the world, including Muslim countries in the world will see their way clear to putting their shoulder to the grindstone to help resolve this problem as well. BAIER: I guess the question is should the president had done more in a lot of opportunities talking with President Xi? POMPEO: There's no country that has done more, and I'm confident will do more, Bret. BAIER: All right, in Hong Kong, you -- we did a story there about the new security law in place. You've certified that Hong Kong is no longer sufficiently autonomous. Again, should the administration have acted more forcefully to deter Chinese crackdown in Hong Kong? POMPEO: I'll tell you, Bret, I wish previous administration had taken China seriously. It's true, well, this isn't partisan, 40 years of failed American policy with respect to China. This administration is trying to clean it up, trying to get it right. Now the Chinese have taken advantage of us -- advantage of us in multiple ways. We've done really good work, important work trying to protect the freedoms of the people of Hong Kong. General Secretary Xi has chosen to go a different direction, and we're responding in a way that will put pressure on Beijing, and try to maintain whatever we can of the remaining freedoms in Hong Kong. I will tell you the notion that the remains, one country and two systems is fundamentally at odds with the facts on the ground today. I regret that. BAIER: You know that your critics including now John Bolton say that this is all about election politics and to get China to buy soybeans and places that affect reelection. POMPEO: Nonsense. BAIER: OK, that's what we get from that. What does success look like with China, the U.S. and China? What does it look like? Can China be a responsible partner with President Xi at the helm in the Chinese Communist Party? POMPEO: Look, that's up to the Chinese Communist Party, that's their decision to make. What the United States can control is what we do. When there's unfair and nonreciprocal trade, we're going to demand by -- demand that it be right. When they don't do, we're going to do things like placing tariffs on their goods. When they engage in behavior that's militarily threatening to the United States, we're going to put $700 billion into our Department of Defense to keep Americans safe and secure. And when the Chinese engage in cyber espionage, we're going to impose penalties on them so that they will be deterred from doing that. Those are the things we can do. We are hopeful, we want the Chinese people to be successful. The Chinese Communist Party today has made a decision, it wants to be an imperialist power, it wants to be authoritarian in nature and it wants to compete across the world in ways they are consistent with the good things happening for the American people. And frankly, people with democracies all across the world. Presidents Trump's policies are aimed squarely at reversing that. BAIER: I want to spend some time on the Russia bounty story in Afghanistan. First, does the Russian government have American blood on its hands in Afghanistan? POMPEO: Bret, I don't want to get into the intelligence. The intelligence community has put out two statements. I used to have that job; I'm going to -- I'm going to honor what they said. Here's what I can say with absolute certainty, the United States has responded appropriately to the threats that have been presented to it in Afghanistan consistently during my entire 3-1/2 half years. First the CIA director and now as Secretary of State, there are many folks using the Taliban or who have used the Taliban over years and years and years as proxy forces. There's been money funneled in there from all across the world, unfortunately. President Trump has taken this seriously, we are hopeful, we'll make progress on our peace and reconciliation plan. And we will respond to any threat, whether that's Iranians using the Taliban or the Russians, we'll make sure they know. The Russians have been providing weapons to the Taliban for an awful lot of years, and so, this is an ongoing challenge we have. And our forces on the ground under General Miller and the resolute support mission are deeply aware of the threat from the Taliban whether that's supported by any third party or none. BAIER: But you know, you just referenced you were CIA director, there's not often consensus across the intelligence community on Intel. And if it dealt with bounties killing American troops, shouldn't the president have been told about it? We know that it was discussed in the National Security Council, the principles and deck this level. You said today the key members of Congress had that Intel as well, even though there wasn't a consensus. Why wasn't the president briefed on it? POMPEO: Well, Bret, that's not actually quite right. Most intelligence that's red -- there is in fact a consensus. Almost all of the analytical product that I read every day has a consensus across the entire intelligence community. It is often the case that it is not that happens. When that happens, we need to make sure we get it right. But Bret you know this, every morning I wake up, and I read the intelligence materials. And when I read them, there are people all across the world who are threatened, including my officers and embassies all across the world. We don't always make sure that gets to the president, we do the right thing. We make sure the ambassador on the ground knows, that the commander on the ground knows, that our allies who may be threatened as well know. It is the tactical and operational response to keep our soldiers safe and secure that is most important. When the intelligence community feels like something rises to the level of needs to get to the president, I'm very confident they will consistently present it to them. I know that when I was the CIA director, I did that. BAIER: Did you know about this particular Intel piece? POMPEO: You know, I don't want to talk about the Intel in particular on this, Bret. BAIER: All right. POMPEO: I mean, there's just -- I just -- I'm not trying to be clever, there's just so much that has been reported that is not accurate and that is incomplete that by refuting any particular element of it. I'm putting at risk our capacity to actually resolve and figure out what's going on. BAIER: And I want to ask you about that in the leak itself, but here is what the democratic nominee is saying about it. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: He either reads and/or gets briefed on important issues and he forgets it, or he doesn't think it's necessary that he need to know it. He should have a minimum, have picked up the phone and said, Vladimir, old buddy, if any of this is true, and it doesn't cease amigo, you've got a big problem. (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: All right, so, it's not just the Democrats, obviously, you have Senator Chuck Grassley on the Senate floor, saying it demands a serious response. You have two key Republicans in the House. Mike McCaul and Adam Kinzinger, saying, \"There are already those who are politicizing this issue. However, we cannot use let politics overshadow the truth that Republicans and Democrats alike can agree on: The Putin regime cannot be trusted. If the intelligence review process verifies the report, we strongly encourage the administration to take swift and serious action to hold the Putin regime accountable.\" POMPEO: Yes. Bret, there's been no administration to hold the Russians accountable the way this one has. I only wish former Vice President Biden had held the Russians accountable. We've been cleaning up a lot less of a mess. I wish we provided arms to the Ukrainians, I wish he had gotten out of the INF Treaty, I wish he hadn't allowed and invited the Syrians -- the Russians into Syria. I could go on, but you got a short show. The failures of previous administration allowed the Russians a lot of space to move. We've pushed back, we sanctioned more Russians than any other administration in history. I'll take a backseat to no one with respect to what our administration and President Trump has done to hold Vladimir Putin accountable when he is engaged in malign activity. And should we find out that there's evidence that he's putting our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines at risk, anywhere in the world, including in Afghanistan, I am very confident that President Trump will direct me, and he himself will respond appropriately. BAIER: How damaging was this leak? You were CIA Director, the White House press secretary the other day, said that there were rogue officers in the intelligence community who want to undercut the president. You believe that? POMPEO: Bret, I don't know where this leak came from. But when periodicals report this information, it breaks my heart because it puts our intelligence officers and our military men and women at risk. It is -- it is dangerous, it is unlawful, and I hope that we can figure out who did it, and they'll be brought to justice. BAIER: Mr. Secretary, you did speak out when it was alleged that Iran was paying the Taliban $1,000 for each American killed in Afghanistan, as a member of Congress, and you, spoke out about the Obama administration's response at the time, which obviously you criticize in the overall Iran deal. POMPEO: Yes, it's absolutely true. I've spoken about the Iranians providing assistance to the Taliban in my current role as secretary of state as well. I've criticized other governments. We've worked to make sure Pakistan wasn't providing safe haven for the Taliban in Afghanistan too. No, where equal opportunity when it comes to making sure we protect the Americans wherever they're serving. BAIER: All right, let's talk about the couple of other substantive things. One, as you mentioned, the Taliban peace deal. You said that the Taliban would publicly renounce al-Qaeda. You talked about that, I asked you about it back in March. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: It says it will not allow any of its members or other individuals or groups, including al-Qaeda to use the soil of Afghanistan to threaten the security of the United States and its allies. But that's not really a break. That's not a renouncing -- POMPEO: Oh, yes. Oh, yes. BAIER: A renouncing of al-Qaeda? POMPEO: Absolutely. Absolutely, when you say you're not going to let them operate there, you know it, Bret. They've done it for 20 years. They're not going to let them operate it anymore. That's -- that is a central provision. (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: You went further saying that they would eventually take up arms and fight al-Qaeda, working alongside us to destroy al-Qaeda. Have you seen any indication that the Taliban is doing any of that? POMPEO: Yes. BAIER: How? POMPEO: But I can't talk about the things that I have seen, but know this, I spoke with the Taliban, again, just this week and effort to further the peace negotiations to try and get them to the table with the Afghan government. I think we're closer than we were even just a couple of weeks back. The Taliban continued to have pressed upon them the importance of this break from al-Qaeda, and I think we will be able to see when we get to that point, when we have these negotiations commenced, I think the world will be able to see that the Taliban are no longer going to tolerate what they've permitted to happen and that the Pakistanis too will do the things that need to be done to reduce the footprint from al-Qaeda. Remember, Bret, we're down to a couple of 100 active al-Qaeda fighters inside of Afghanistan. The reason we went there in 2001 was to crush al- Qaeda. That has largely been achieved. BAIER: Can you confidently state that America will have U.S. troops in Afghanistan on Election Day? POMPEO: President will ultimately make that decision, Bret. BAIER: OK. One more thing, the E.U. blocking travelers from the U.S. due to the coronavirus pandemic. Your reaction to that, and is there any pushback from the U.S.? POMPEO: Well, remember, we're not allowing Europeans to come here today, either, Bret. We're in close conversation with countries all around the world, including European countries, to make sure that when we reopen our country to travel from their nations. That we do so in a way that keeps American people safer and reduces risk from COVID here in the United States. They have a responsibility to do that for their nations as well. And I'm very confident that we'll get this right with countries all across the world. It's not just the Europeans, we need to get this right, we need to get the economy back up, when you get people traveling all across to the United States, and international travel as well. BAIER: Mr. Secretary, we appreciate your time. POMPEO: Thank you, Bret. BAIER: Happy Independence Day, early. POMPEO: Thank you. Happy Fourth of July to you too, Bret. BAIER: All right, all the best. Up next, California and New York become the latest states to halt the process of reopening. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BAIER: Private payroll processor ADP, found U.S. companies added nearly 2.4 million jobs in June, with small businesses reporting the biggest increase. According to the data, the economy still has about 14 million fewer jobs than it did in February. President Trump is back in more stimulus as part of the recovery from coronavirus, telling Fox Business, he is not -- he not only favors more payments to individuals, but he wants them to be even larger than the first time around. Stocks started the third quarter of 2020 on a mixed note. The Dow dropped 78. The S&P 500 gained 16, and a record high closed for the NASDAQ which finished ahead 96. Here in Washington, the Fourth of July fireworks show will go on with the Trump administration promising one of the largest displays ever. 300 000 masks will be given away on the National Mall. But attendees will not be required to wear them. Other states are pausing the reopening process and mandating masks. Correspondent Jonathan Serrie, looks at the coronavirus trends across the country. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JONATHAN SERRIE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Alarmed by an increase in coronavirus cases, California's governor has announced a three-week closure of bars and restaurant dining rooms. While the mayor of New York City has postponed plans to reopen in restaurant dining. BILL DE BLASIO, MAYOR OF NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK: The news we have gotten from around the country gets worse and worse all the time. SERRIE: Public health officials say large Memorial Day gatherings and complacency over the use of face masks are driving the nation's new spike in COVID-19 cases. Today, an emergency order in Savannah, Georgia, imposed a $500 fine on people who failed to wear face coverings in public. Doctors at Emory University, say mandates are more effective than recommendations based on their own experience in hospitals. JONATHAN LEWIN, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, EMORY HEALTHCARE: When we simply strongly encouraged face masks, we still saw community spread. When we required masks, we saw our infection rates within our workforce plummet. SERRIE: Following a lot of criticism today, President Trump, explained he usually doesn't wear a mask because people who visit the president are tested. DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: If I were in a tight situation with people, I would absolutely be -- (CROSSTALK) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Do you think the public will see that at some point? TRUMP: I mean, I'd have no problem. Actually, I had a mask and I said I like the way I looked. SERRIE: Although the U.S. leads the world and confirm COVID-19 cases, its deaths per 100,000 population remain among the lowest. However, health experts say that's not reason for complacency. DR. CARLOS DEL RIO, PROFESSOR OF MEDICINE, EMORY UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE: I worry less about the numbers right now, and I worry more about the trend. And the fact that we're seeing an exponential growth is really what bothers me right now, and what really makes me very concerned. (END VIDEOTAPE) SERRIE: Public health officials are especially concerned about the upcoming Fourth of July holiday when many people are planning get-togethers, they're urging people to limit the size of gatherings, and to wear face coverings when social distancing is not possible. Bret. BAIER: Jonathan Serrie in Atlanta. Jonathan, thank you. Up next, the end of the chop zone in Seattle and budget cuts for the NYPD. First, here is what some of our Fox affiliates around the country are covering tonight. FOX 4 in Kansas City, where you, the American taxpayer have an almost 30 percent stake in a trucking company that ships military equipment. The Treasury Department will loan YRC worldwide $700 million in exchange for a stake in the company. Congress gave permission to the deal as a way to ensure taxpayer money is not misspent. FOX 7 in Austin, Texas where the U.S. army says partial human remains have been found close to the Leon River in Bell County. In the search for missing Fort Hood soldier Vanessa Guillen. 20-year-old Guillen was last seen on April 22nd, a family attorney says one suspect committed suicide as police closed in on them. Another suspect is in custody. And this is a live look at San Francisco from our affiliate FOX 2 out there. One of the big stories there tonight. Police, say they will stop making mug shots publicly available unless the person poses a threat to the public. The police chief, says the move is part of an effort to stop perpetuating racial stereotypes and protect the presumption of innocence. That's tonight's live look \"OUTSIDE THE BELTWAY\" from SPECIAL REPORT. We'll be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BAIER: In downtown Seattle, the Capitol Hill Organized Protest zone, or CHOP, is no more. Police cleared the area after the mayor declared it an unlawful assembly following two deadly shootings in less than two weeks there. Correspondent Dan Springer reports. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DAN SPRINGER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Acting on the mayor's executive order signed overnight, police officers and FBI agents moved into the area known as CHOP just before 5:00 a.m. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We need to be clear now. If we don't clear out then we'll be forced to arrest. SPRINGER: While most peacefully left, police, some in riot gear, did arrest at least 30 people for offenses including failure to disperse, assault, and unlawful weapon possession. CARMEN BEST, SEATTLE POLICE CHIEF: What has happened here on these streets is lawless, and it's brutal, and bottom line, it is simply unacceptable. SPRINGER: Established in early June in the wake of George Floyd's death, what was initially an overwhelmingly peaceful protest soon became linked to incidents of violence. Black Lives Matter and similar groups had already pulled out, and there was now concern from both protesters and the city that CHOP's original message, a call for police reform, has been drowned out. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We're going to have to work 10 times as hard to get our message back on track. BEST: Black Lives Matter, and I too want to help propel this movement forward, but enough is enough. (END VIDEOTAPE) SPRINGER: Seattle police are back inside the east precinct which they abandoned in early June. The question now is how long they will hold and keep it from becoming of point again as protestors say the idea of CHOP isn't over yet. Bret? BAIER: Dan Springer in Seattle. Dan, thanks. Just after midnight early this morning, New York City's City Council passed the city's $88 billion budget that includes $1 billion in cuts to the NYPD. But that has not resulted in the end of Occupy City Hall protesters. Correspondent Aishah Hasnie looks at the situation in the big apple today. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: As hereby adopted as of 12:26 p.m. -- AISHAH HASNIE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: With ah historic vote, New York City leaders defunded the NYPD's $6 billion budget by close to $1 billion. The 2021 budget cuts include cutting the number of recruits in half, which would save $40 million, and a reduction on police overtime spending by $352 million. And it comes at a time when shootings are up across the city compared to this time last year. The city faces a $9 billion loss due to coronavirus, and police retirements are rising. DERMOT SHEA, NEW YORK CITY POLICE COMMISSIONER: Let's mark the date on the calendar and how long it's going to be before we'll have that conversation about New Yorkers crying out for more police. HASNIE: But some protesters outside city hall and council members feel the budget did not go far enough. They wanted to eliminate school safety officers and introduce a hiring freeze on police. JONATHAN LYKES, BLACK YOUTH PROJECT 100: We're not happy with the budget, let me be clear. We know that they political tricks. HASNIE: Mayor Bill de Blasio said he will continue to support peaceful protests, but the city needs to move forward now. Protesters, though, have a different message for their mayor. LYKES: We're coming for you. We're going to escalate tactics. We're going to be disruptive. (END VIDEOTAPE) HASNIE: And that very same organizer tells me the people in charge of organizing Occupy City Hall will leave now that the budget has passed, but they will continue to support anyone who wants to stay. Bret? BAIER: Aishah, thank you. Up next, the battle over our nation's history ahead of the holiday weekend. First, Beyond our Borders tonight.

Several thousand Palestinians peacefully marched in Gaza City to protest those plans. Russian voters approved a package of constitutional changes allowing President Vladimir Putin to serve two more terms, possibly staying in power until 2036. The weeklong vote was tarnished by reports of pressure on voters and other irregularities. Putin, who has been in power more than two decades, did not mentioning his political future during a speech Tuesday and has yet to commit to running to 2024 when his current term expires. And way Beyond our Borders, NASA astronauts replaced batteries on the outside of the International Space Station today. For every two batteries removed, a new one and improved one is installed to power the station while on the night side of the earth.

The move comes at a time when the fight over Confederacy symbols takes center stage on Capitol Hill. Congressional correspondent Chad Pergram has the story. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) CHAD PERGRAM, FOX NEWS PRODUCER: Pageantry and imagery defined most Fourths of July. This holiday could ignite flashpoints around the nation's uncomfortable history. There's concern demonstrators could again try to topple controversial statues. KAYLEIGH MCENANY, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: Law and order are the building blocks to the American dream. Anarchy in our streets is unacceptable. PERGRAM: The Department of Homeland Security is deploying special teams to protect federal monuments in Portland, Oregon, and Washington, D.C. President Trump warned people his executive order to safeguard monuments is in full force. That prompted a veto threat of the Senate's annual defense bill if lawmakers stand by a plan to rename bases named after Confederates. SEN. JAMES INHOFE (R-OK), SENATE ARMED SERVICES COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN: He's serious about it. You know the president. He makes up his mind, and he does things. SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER, (D-NY) SENATE MINORITY LEADER: This is nothing but typical bluster from President Trump. At the NDAA will pass. PERGRAM: Still, this bill may not go to the president to sign until fall. SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL, (R-KY) SENATE MAJORITY LEADER: I hope the president would reconsider vetoing the entire defense bill, which includes pay raises for our troops, over a provision in there that could lead to changing the names of some of these military bases. PERGRAM: But members of the Congressional Black Caucus aren't convinced some changes are truly for racial justice, such as Mississippi's decision to mothball its flag with the Confederate emblem. SEN. BENNIE THOMPSON, (D-MS) CONGRESSIONAL BLACK CAUCUS: When SEC, NCAA, the bankers, the richest man in the state who was a Trump delegate said we need to change the flag, boom, it changed. (END VIDEOTAPE) PERGRAM: President Trump believes the culture war over monuments works politically in his favor, but Democrats think that Black Lives Matter tilts the field in their direction. That's why fights over statues and military bases represents a proxy war ahead of November. Bret? BAIER: Chad Pergram live on the Hill. Chad, thanks. Next up, the panel reacts to my interview with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and the big stories around the world, next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: Does the Russian government have American blood on its hands in Afghanistan? MIKE POMPEO, SECRETARY OF STATE: Bret, I don't want to get into the intelligence. The United States has responded appropriately to the threats that have been presented to it in Afghanistan consistently. There are many folks using the Taliban, or who have used the Taliban over years and years and years as proxy forces. I don't know where this leak came from, but when periodicals report this information, it breaks my heart, because it puts our intelligent officers and our military men and women at risk. It is dangerous, it is unlawful, and I hope that we can figure out who did it, and they'll be brought to justice. (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: Secretary of State Mike Pompeo talking about that Russia bounty story in Afghanistan. We'll start there with our panel, Ben Domenech, publisher of \"The Federalist,\" Mara Liasson, national political correspondent for National Public Radio, and Josh Holmes, former top advisor to Mitch McConnell, now president of Cavalry Consultants. Ben, thoughts on his answer, and the story overall. BEN DOMENECH, \"THE FEDERALIST\": First off, I think his answer was as clarifying as he possibly could be in this moment, which is clearly, there's a big muddle here about where this intelligence came from, why it was leaked in the way that it was, and what we are supposed to take away from this situation overall. He is correct that the Taliban has been used as a proxy force in all sorts of different ways. It does seem like this story came out in a way that would undermine the efforts of American forces to figure out what was actually going on in this scenario, and coming at the truth. But I think that that's probably going to lead to a discovery that leads to an indication that this was trying to do something that undermined the president and undermined his overall efforts in the region. BAIER: Clearly the president think so, said it on FOX Business. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, (R) PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: When you bring something into a president, and I see many, many things. And I'm sure I don't see many things that they don't think rose to the occasion. This didn't rise to the occasion. And from what I hear, and I hear it pretty good, the intelligence people, many of them didn't believe it happened at all. I think it's a hoax. I think it's a hoax by the newspapers and the Democrats. (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: Mara? MARA LIASSON, NATIONAL POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, NATIONAL PUBLIC RADIO: Yes, well, Secretary Pompeo didn't say it was a hoax. He was angry that it leaked, I understand that, but I guess the question now is, is this real or not? Did the Russians but a bounty on U.S. troops? And what does the president want to do about it, if anything? So I think that's the next chapter of this. They're going to try to find out who leaked it, that's kind of one problem. But the other one is, if it's true, what is the administration going to do? BAIER: Josh, the national security advisor spoke about the CIA briefer. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ROBERT O'BRIEN, NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER: The person who decided early on whether the president should be briefed on this in Oval intelligence briefing was his career -- senior career civil servant CIA officer. And she made that decision because she didn't have confidence in the intelligence that came up. She made that call. And you know what, I think she made the right call. (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: So there's all kinds of people speculating, did they not want to bring it to President Trump because of what he would think about it, would he tweet about it, would he talk to President Putin in some way, shape, or form about it? That's not what they're saying, Josh. JOSH HOLMES, CAVALRY CONSULTANTS: No, they're not saying that at all. What they're saying is that the CIA and the intelligence services concluded that it wasn't ready for primetime, that in fact it wasn't ready to present the president or congressional leaders, for that matter. I don't think it's difficult to see what's happening here. It was, however, determined fit to print in \"The New York Times.\" And the reason it is fit to leak to \"The New York Times\" is because it goes to this ongoing narrative that Democrats, frankly, cannot let go of, that somehow this president is preferential to Russia. We've gone through three-and-a-half years, tens of millions of dollars in investigations, conclusions definitively that that is not the case, both in terms of policy and in terms of past actions. And yet here we are again debating the same thing. I don't think there's any question in anybody's mind that if we have definitive proof that Russia had bounties on American soldiers that this president is going to act decisively to ensure that that doesn't happen, and they'll have a huge response if it does. BAIER: We mentioned the Iranian bounties on American soldiers in Afghanistan, and reaction of the Obama administration after that, Ben. DOMENECH: So I certainly think that the president would have a very robust response of this. The truth is that, as Josh indicated, we've had all of these allegations put out there, including by this current Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, who continues to engage in this ridiculous campaign where she suggests that Vladimir Putin has some of kind of thing over on the president. It's ludicrous, it's laughable. But it is a situation where I think when issues like this arise, we want to have clarity. And I think in this case, we don't really have clarity about what went on here, and we may not be able to have clarity because of the way that this story played out. BAIER: Meantime, the COVID situation, the news about the cases around the country and spikes in different states, Mara, the president speaking out that he's OK with masks. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, (R) PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I'm all for masks, I think masks are good. I would wear -- if I were in a group of people and I was close -- UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You would wear one? TRUMP: I would. I have. People have seen me wearing one. If I'm in a group of people where were not 10 feet away, but usually I'm not in that position. And everyone's tested. Because I'm the president, they get tested before they see me. But if I was in a tight situation with people, I would absolutely. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Do think the public will see that at some point? TRUMP: I'd have no problem. Actually, I had a mask on. I sort of liked the way I looked. (END VIDEO CLIP) (LAUGHTER) BAIER: Mara, listen, there are, on the serious side of this, Mara -- LIASSON: This is a new, this is -- BAIER: There's the economic guys that are looking at this saying, if you're pro-mask and you don't shut down, you could save the country a lot of GDP percentage that might go down if there's another shutdown. LIASSON: There's been some pretty studying estimates that masks help the economy, because you can go back to work with them. This is a new message from the president than the past. He suggested to the \"Wall Street Journal\" that people who wear masks are doing it to show their disapproval of him. He said to a reporter at the White House, you're wearing a mask because it's politically correct. So it sounds like the White House is changing its tune on masks. The question is, will the president start wearing one, not because he needs it to protect himself or others in the White House, but to model this behavior as something that other people should do. BAIER: And how much will he talk about COVID and be a part of the task force? There's all kinds of questions coming up with the politics. Panel, thank you so much with the secretary's interview. We'll stop there. Appreciate it. When we come back, the brighter side of things, some good news. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BAIER: Finally tonight, when life gives you lemons, you try to make lemonade, right? Well, that was the case for a five-year-old Cooper Wallweber when he heard that a volunteer firefighter was injured in a shooting at a local restaurant, he felt compelled to do something good for her. The Missouri boy got to work making and selling lemonade, raising more than $3,000 from his lemonade stand to help her out. Good job. Princess Paige Lemonade is well known in some neighborhoods around Minneapolis. Its founder, six-year-old Paige, sells lemonade in stores around the Twin Cities. The young entrepreneur donates the profits to the Ronald McDonald House for Families living near a sick child getting treatment, and sometimes Paige visits those kids who are dealing with the medical issues, and of course she shares her lemonade. So there you go, making lemonade out of lemons. Thanks for inviting us into your home tonight. That's it for the SPECIAL REPORT, fair, balanced, and still unafraid. \"THE STORY\" hosted by Martha MacCallum starts right now.

Don't fall for the Roger Stone hysteria, just a distraction, just like the Russia bounty story.The president's power to commute sentences almost absolute. George Washington granted clemency to traitors. Andrew Johnson pardoned every single Confederate soldier. Gerald Ford pardon Nixon. Bill Clinton pardoned his own brother. That's what brothers are for. Bill Clinton pardoned the former C.I.A. Director and his business partner, Susan McDougal, and he pardoned the biggest tax cheat in U.S. history, international fugitive, Mark Rich after Rich's wife donated a half a million to Clinton's presidential library.Barack Obama commuted the sentence of Chelsea Manning, who conspired with WikiLeaks and the media loved it.But Trump commuted the sentence of Roger Stone who did not conspire with WikiLeaks and the media hated it. See what's going on here? There was never any evidence of collusion because there was never any collusion. Nobody has ever been charged with collusion or conspiracy with the Russians.Stone was charged in order to cover up a corrupt investigation. Trump's campaign was framed by the Democrats, the C.I.A. and the crooked F.B.I. agents we all know and love.They planted in doctored evidence. They used spies and foreign agents. They illegally leaked hatch stings and got caught.What happened was this. Roger Stone refused to get framed, so they tried to put them in jail. Stone refused to make up dirt about Trump, so they charged him with crimes. How sick is that?If police plant a gun on you, and then you throw it in the river, you shouldn't be charged with obstruction. That's basically what Mueller's boys did here.Stone should have just acid washed his hard drive like Hillary, right? Apparently, that's totally fine.If you tell your buddy not to cooperate with crooked cops because you're being framed, you shouldn't be charged with witness tampering. That's what they did to Stone.And Stone's buddy testified he was never even intimidated by Stone. They charged him with making false statements. You know, easy it is for the Feds to make that charge? That's the same charge they slapped General Mike Flynn with. Now, and new notes we just saw that the F.B.I. released to show that the F.B.I. didn't even think Flynn was lying.Stone told a so-called lie to Congress, but James Clapper can lie and get away with it. McCabe can lie to investigators and that's okay. Congress can lie to you, but you'll get locked up for lying to Congress.Schiff lied for three years that he had evidence of collusion -- false. But Stone said, I didn't collude -- true -- and he gets charged. You can't cover up a crime that never happened. Crooked investigations only produced crooked charges.You can't frame innocent people, investigate them for crimes they didn't commit, and then lock them up when they refuse to go along with your show trial.The jury foreman in the Stone trial was a raging Trump hater also. She was a member of the resistance. She is all over social media disparaging Donald Trump, she hates him, but she lies her way onto the jury and gets caught covering up her bias, so the jury is tainted, right? No. The Obama appointed judge is okay with it. What a joke.Now, I'll be honest. Stone is no saint. He has been playing in the gutter for decades. It doesn't make him a criminal though. He's just a political operator, and somewhat of an opportunist.There's guys like Stone all over the political world, on the left and on the right. Hillary paid for an operative millions to interfere in the election and smear Trump with Russian disinformation. She bought a warrant so Obama could spy on the Trump campaign. It was all fake. But the media doesn't talk about that, because they were in on it. That's 10 times worse than what they say Stone did.Now, I also don't want to hear Democrats in the media crowing about the rule of law either. As I said before, pardon power is perfectly legal. But here's the point, the left spent the last two months looking the other way at looting and encouraging mobs to rip down the public property in the middle of the night, statues.'The left let radicals create their own country in the middle of Seattle and didn't make a move on it until after two black Americans were murdered. The rule of law -- really?Biden's son was bribed by the Chinese and the Ukrainians. The Saudis were sending Clinton's foundation millions, then they murdered someone in their Embassy. Did Hillary send the money back?Did Comey uphold the rule of law when the F.B.I. doctored evidence to illegally spy on the Trump campaign?A Mexican national can illegally cross the border, commit a crime in San Francisco, and the city won't let I.C.E. pick him up and deport him. That's respecting the rule of law?The Democrats believe in mob rule, not the rule of law. That's why they're waging a war on the First and the Second Amendments. That's why when they tried to impeach the President, they jumped over the judicial system and rushed their case to the Senate instead.The media wants an old man to catch COVID-19 in prison and die behind bars. Really? They want hardcore felons sprung from jail so they don't get sick. But want a Republican with no prior record to rot and drop dead.The left is just mad because Trump sniffed out there witch hunt and stopped it.These were processed crimes and a baseless and politically motivated investigation. This was a dirty tricks hit job on Trump, because he was a threat to their power. They tried to criminalize the movement because it put America first.The movement put the people over the politicians, the swamp is going after Trump because they're really going after you, the voters, because you put him there.Trump represents change, the change you voted for, getting out of Syria, rebuilding America instead of Afghanistan, putting a stop to the Germans ripping us off, challenging the Chinese government thieves, shredding the dumb climate and trade deals, securing the border for American workers and keeping judges out of our business and politicians' hands out of our pockets.Stone is small potatoes compared to the stakes of the election. Free Stone, free Flynn, let Durham indict some bad guys, but we have to stop looking in the rear view mirror.The election is less than four months away. There's only three issues: jobs, China and Biden, a dangerous buffoon who is going to destroy everything Americans have been working towards.Trump is the jobs President. Biden is the mob president. Trump was elected because he was a businessman who was looking out for the working man after the Obama-Biden regime let foreign nations and illegal immigrants steal jobs -- good paying jobs, especially manufacturing jobs that were roaring back until the Chinese communists let the virus escape out of Wuhan into the world.The Chinese government lied, covered it up, hoarded masks, gouged us and then blamed us.Trump needs to confront China and rally the country around Made in the U.S.A. and hold the communists accountable.Bringing factories out of China and back to the America puts the foreign policy and the economic policy together. Protecting America from COVID-19 and punishing the source keeps Americans safe and focused.And now it's time to define Biden. He's a fool who can't be trusted with power. He's been a Washington politician his whole life and put America last during the Cold War and the war on terror.He let China and the Europeans eat our lunch while the forgotten men and women suffered. He never protected us from criminal illegals or ISIS, and he doesn't have the spine to stand up to the Bernie bros, AOC, Pelosi, Antifa, or the mob.Biden is an economic illiterate who lets lobbyists and the globalists write the rules and rig the game. Even his family members take advantage of Joe, because he's an easy mark.But don't let folksy good old Joe fool you. It is just a slick sales job by the pros. Biden's an empty suit for socialism.So the Trump campaign should be hammering away at what really matters. Boom, boom, boom. It's right there for the taking. No more distractions.Let's finish writing the American comeback story. There's not a lot of time left.Reaction to that in a moment, but first breaking news in China's coronavirus cover up. Here with that, former Trump White House chief strategist, Steve Bannon, the host of the podcast \"War Room Pandemic.\"All right, Steve, what are your sources telling you about Chinese covering up the virus?STEVE BANNON, FORMER WHITE HOUSE CHIEF STRATEGIST: Well, we know we're starting to have, Jesse, doctors, actually people associated with the Hong Kong lab and people associated with Wuhan, people associated with their entire biomedical and bio weapons defense industry start to defect and start to get information. There's a massive whistleblower campaign in China right now.People have to understand that Chinese people are the victims of the Chinese Communist Party. They've been the victims of this CCP virus, and they're starting to tell the story.Fox News broke an incredible story, I think it was yesterday with Dr. Yan, who is the first of many that are going to start to come out. Some of them are already out in Europe, the United Kingdom and other places.And you're going to start to see now the Intelligence agencies, the F.B.I., others start to put this together of what the real source of this virus was, how culpable the Chinese Communist Party is about this virus, particularly what they visited on their people and what they visited on the people in the United States.The Chinese Communist Party lied, 130,000 Americans died. We have an economic inferno in our country, an economic inferno around the world. We've blown up the balance sheets of the Federal Reserve and everybody else to try to bridge this in a smart way.That is all the responsibility of the Chinese Communist Party. They have to be held accountable, I think you're going to see a lot more Dr. Yan's start to come forward, and I think she's got a lot more to say.WATTERS: Oh, yes. So the defections are going to blow the lid off this thing. And the President needs to be much more aggressive in the way he confronts the Communist Chinese because they need to pay a price.Americans need to see them paying a price and they need to feel it, because that's going to unite the country around a common goal.So, what did you think about my analysis about the stakes in the election in terms of the economic policy, merging that with the foreign policy, and then defining Joe Biden as the bumbling buffoon that he is?BANNON: That that's the playbook right there. Look, the tell was the other day when Joe Biden who is the senator from Wilmington, Delaware, remember, he represents all the global corporations. He's been the biggest globalist in the Senate for 40 years.He pushed W.T.O. for the Chinese. He pushed most favored nation. He pushed NAFTA. You know, Chuck Todd said yesterday on an interview, it is kind of stunning to see Joe Biden trying to recreate himself as an economic populist and an economic nationalist.The reason is, that's where the country is. Donald Trump is a populist. He's an economic nationalist. He is the first President to confront China. But there's so much more to do.Right now in Hong Kong, President Trump ought to drop the hammer. That is Czechoslovakia in 1938. President Trump ought to cut them off from the U.S. dollar. He ought to sanction Hong Kong Shanghai Bank, Bank of China, CITIC, Penang Group, then ought to sanction individuals, Wang Xin and I think he ought to sanction President Xi.WATTERS: Wow.BANNON: President Trump ought to throw down. President Trump ought to throw down. Look, the Chinese Communist Party, they did this because he had built a striver's economy, it wasn't going to be pushed around.The Chinese Communist Party, coming out of that weapons lab and hiding it. We now know and Dr. Yan gives you a detailed analysis of how the Beijing C.D.C. knew this back in late December, early January of 2020, late December 2019.What she told Fox the other day is explosive, every paper in the world has picked it up -- I think you're just at the top of the first thing with her and there are many more like her that are going to start coming forward.Remember, people in China are decent and hardworking folks. They understand the brutality of the Chinese Communist Party. They understand that they are bad guys in a totalitarian dictatorship, and you're going to see, Jesse, many more things coming out.But I think you laid out the playbook. What I would tell the President, it is action, action, action. You're the protagonist in this drama.WATTERS: Right.BANNON: Drive the action. All Joe Biden could do is try -- Joe Biden has got to recreate himself in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan or Wisconsin. Those are your voters, Mr. President. Just complete -- drop the hammer. More Executive Orders on buy American and hire American.Remember, Joe Biden wants to give amnesty to 20 million illegals that will flood the workforce that will suppress wages for African-Americans and Hispanics. He also wants to have full medical benefits for illegal aliens. This will crush the budget.President Trump is both buy American and hire American, and now is the time, I think to drop the hammer on jobs, on China, on sinking the American way of life.WATTERS: Yes, and Sleepy Joe just completely plagiarized that out of the Donald Trump playbook.You've zeroed in on something that I don't think a lot of people realize though. So the Senator from Delaware -- Delaware is the state where all of the multinational corporations incorporate for tax purposes. So, he's been doing their bidding for decades, and that's what this is all about.The guy is just a car and he is being driven by powers that don't have the best interest of the American worker at heart and Donald Trump needs to point that out day after day after day.Now, strategically, when you have Joe Biden hiding in the basement, for a while, I thought maybe you know what, he is surviving in the basement. You know, maybe Donald Trump needs to smoke him out.And now I'm thinking, you know what? Let him stay in the basement. Let him not travel to swing states. Let him get rusty. Let him not see the country and just have them just roll in the debates, not in fighting shape thinking he's going to win like a boxer that doesn't train because the Vegas bookmakers have him ahead a few points. What do you think?BANNON: Look, I think that's one strategy. I also think if you want to smoke him out, it is not going to be rhetoric. You're going to smoke him out with action. Action, action, action on jobs, on EOs about jobs.Biden's line he tried to use in the present is that, all you care about is the stock market and the investor class. That's the biggest chutzpah I've ever seen.It was Joe Biden and Barack Obama that in their administration, we had the greatest concentration of wealth in world history from the crash of 2008 until Donald Trump took the oath of office. Donald Trump's economy, although we had a robust stock market, Donald Trump's economy was a striver's economy.Remember, it's the first time that working class people's wages were increasing more than people with college degrees. That's what we had before he --WATTERS: Donald Trump actually decreased the income inequality that was exacerbated during the Obama-Biden years. You know, everything's backwards, but I think -- I think that the playbook is out there to win this thing. It just needs to be simple and strong and you know, relentless day after day after day. Look, no tie band and I'm pulling the band look. What do you think?BANNON: Jesse, he's a man of action. He's a man of action.WATTERS: Right.BANNON: Jesse, all we need is action, action, action. Let Joe Biden try to recreate you himself when you're the guy you are. Thanks, Jesse.WATTERS: All right, thanks, Steve.Joe Biden, plagiarizing President Trump's economic plan. Here we go again. Up next, Rudy Giuliani on that.And later, the Epstein tapes starring some very famous politicians. A new bombshell accusation from a jewel thief.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BIDEN: I went to law school on a full academic scholarship. The only one in my class to have a full academic scholarship. I went back to law school and in fact ended up in the top half of my class.I was the outstanding student in the Political Science Department at the end of my year. I graduated with three degrees from undergraduate school and 165 credits, only had 123 credits.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Biden now concedes he did not graduate in the top half of his law school class, that he does not have three degrees from college, and that he was not named outstanding political science student in college.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: \"Newsweek\" says Biden actually went to school on a half scholarship, ended up near the bottom of his class and earned only one degree, not three.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: That was Joe Biden years ago taking credit for things he didn't actually do. And he is at it again. He's just unveiled his plan for the economy and guess who it sounds just like?(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BIDEN: When the Federal government spends taxpayers' money, we should use it to buy American products and support American jobs.PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: In my administration, we live by two simple rules, buy American and hire American.Buy American and hire American.Buy American and hire American.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Even the name of this original economic idea, stolen. The slogan, Build Back Better was used by the United Nations back in April.Joining me now, former New York City mayor and President Trump's personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani. You know, we better be careful, he might start saying Make America Great Again.RUDY GIULIANI, PRESIDENT TRUMP'S PERSONAL ATTORNEY: I mean, Jesse, to listen to that is -- I can't understand how he is running for President.WATTERS: Me neither.GIULIANI: The first time I heard about Joe Biden was about 33 years ago. One of his law school classmates was my colleague in the U.S. Attorney's Office, eventually my Chief of Staff when I was Associate Attorney General, and he said to me, you should run for the Senate in Delaware. I said, why?He said, because anybody can get elected. Joe Biden was in my law school class. He was the dumbest guy in the class. He cheated his way through law school. He plagiarized at least once and cheated about four or five times.He's a nice guy, but he is so dumb it is going to take your breath away.And I've known him over the years and every time he'd make one of these mistakes, I would think about what I was told that he was dumb.And then of course, he plagiarized again. Remember when he plagiarized Neil Kinnock, he didn't just plagiarize him, he plagiarized his life.WATTERS: Yes.GIULIANI: He said that his family had never had anyone who graduated from college. They did. He said that they had worked in coal mines all their lives. Only one had worked for a coal mining company as an accountant. He completely plagiarized a man's life.The man is a pathological liar. He obviously has some kind of dementia or Alzheimer's. It's clear.And finally, I happen to know, he is a big crook. The family has been taking money for 30 years. They sell his office. They sold this office in Iraq. They sold his office in Ukraine, and they made a fortune in China.And you know, he always claims, well, I don't know. Meanwhile, his brother is becoming a millionaire. His son who is afflicted with unfortunately with drug addiction becomes a multimillionaire. And this money is for them. Of course, it's for Joe. It's to buy Joe's influence.And then he fixed the case in Ukraine, which the American media is covering up and attacking me over it, rather than going after the criminal, Joe Biden and his family.The guy is a total -- he is a total creation. I mean, it's like --WATTERS: Yes, but Joe Biden is a hot mess and everybody knows it, Mayor.GIULIANI: And now --WATTERS: And now you remember, he comes out and says, don't defund the police. Now, he has changed his tune. Now, he says, we need to redirect money away from the police, almost Clinton-esque. Listen to this soundbite.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BIDEN: Surplus military equipment for law enforcement. They don't need that. The last thing you need is an up armored Humvee coming into a neighborhood. It's like the military invading.They don't know anybody, they become the enemy. They're supposed to be protecting these people.So my generic point is that --UNIDENTIFIED MALE: But do we agree that we can redirect some of the funding?BIDEN: Yes, absolutely.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: So Joe has always been a patsy for the left. He was pulled away left on abortion, on energy, on reparations during the primary and now, he is getting pulled left again by the defund the police movement.I think the President just wants to pin him down on these things in the swing states.GIULIANI: Well, I mean, I worked with him on the Crime Bill of 1994 that provided 100,000 more police. So, this is a totally -- but I mean, I don't think Joe Biden actually at this point, even really understands completely what he is saying, which is really frightening.I mean, the Democratic Party is so cynical, they're running an incompetent -- mentally incompetent human being for President of the United States, which is similar to Mueller.I mean, they got a guy who doesn't have everything going, and they can use him like a patsy, and he is a patsy. He'll say anything AOC wants. He will -- this guy was pro-police.WATTERS: Yes.GIULIANI: Now, he wants to defund the police, which is part of the Marxist Black Lives Matter program, which, by the way is funded by a convicted terrorist, who I happen to convict, Susan Rosenberg who got 58 years in jail and was corruptly pardoned by Bill Clinton.The woman should be in jail right now. She was involved with the Black Panthers who floated police officers. So please don't be fooled by Black Lives Matter.Maybe a fool like Biden can be fooled by it. But intelligent people like the people listening to you should take a look at the three Marxist who founded it, and the terrorist who is funding it.WATTERS: And a lot of that money, you know, when you donate to Black Lives Matter does end up going to the Biden people because it goes through this little wholesale website.GIULIANI: It goes right through a terrorist. The money actually goes right through the terrorist.WATTERS: Exactly. So Joe has been taken advantage of by his family. He has been taken advantage of by the far left, he's been taken advantage of by China and other countries.Can you imagine the level of racketeering and corruption and swindling that's going to go on while Joe is in the White House, not knowing up from down? It's going to be a free for all on the American people. I'll give you the last word.GIULIANI: Well, you know, the only reason I can think that his family is letting him run is because they want to steal more money. They've already stolen millions and sold out the American people. If that were my father or brother, I'd take them off television.I would I would say, hey, Joe, it's time to throw in the towel.WATTERS: Yes, it's elder abuse. A lot of people say that.GIULIANI: You don't make sense anymore. You're making -- but unless, unless, unless I was a greedy crook, and I was looking to make even more money. I mean, they have made about $40 million or $50 million off of him.WATTERS: Yes.GIULIANI: Selling his office.WATTERS: No one wants to report --GIULIANI: They are selling out America.WATTERS: No one wants to report that.GIULIANI: Nobody wants to report it.WATTERS: Where's Hunter? That's all I'm -- where is Hunter, by the way, who knows?GIULIANI: It was never about Hunter. It was about bribing Joe.WATTERS: I know. I know. He is just a conduit. Exactly. He's the go between.All right, Rudy Giuliani, thank you very much.GIULIANI: Thank you.WATTERS: Liberals start the dumbest boycott ever, if you can believe it. Details ahead on that.And the government goes into the home of that St. Louis couple and seizes their rifle. Outrageous.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)JACKIE IBANEZ, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT: Live from \"America's News Headquarters,\" I'm Jackie Ibanez in New York.

You're watching the most powerful name in news, Fox News Channel. Have a great night.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)ROBERT UNANUE, CEO, GOYA FOODS: We're all truly blessed at the same time to have a leader like President Trump who is a builder. We pray for our leadership, our President, and we pray for our country.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Praise for President Trump from the CEO of Goya Foods sparking calls for a boycott from liberals. Imagine that. But that CEO refusing to apologize.Here with reaction Trump 2020 campaign senior adviser, Corey Lewandowski. Corey, like the top three inexpensive meals in this country for families, you have barbecue, you have pizza and you have tacos.There is no way the American people are not going into the grocery store, that little Goya Taka kit. They're not boycotting that. That would be like me boycotting hair gel.COREY LEWANDOWSKI, FORMER TRUMP CAMPAIGN MANAGER: You know, Jesse, look, I hope every person who supports this President and loves their country goes out and buys some of their products.You know, this guy, the only word that comes to mind for me is cojones. This guy stood up to the left. Right? I don't know Spanish, Jesse, but I think that means that that guy is tough. Okay.And what that means is when he went and saw President Clinton, I'm sorry, President Obama at the White House, he was praised. He was jeered. He was a CEO that everyone should admire and respect. He goes and sees President Trump in the Rose Garden, and all of a sudden, you know, the left want to boycott him.This is the hypocrisy of the media, and I think the Trump train is going to come through and Goya's profits are going to go through the roof because of it.WATTERS: Yes. I mean, if you look around out there, I don't think Americans are giving up any meals, if you know what I mean.This reminds me of what Kanye West said the other day, Corey. He was talking about how the Democratic Party uses threats to coerce minorities into staying in the Democratic camp, and this is what that is again.Instead of persuading minority business owners with results or words, they're trying to go after their bottom line with intimidation. That's because the liberals have failed the minority community. And so they have to keep them in line with threats like this.LEWANDOWSKI: Well, Jesse, there's two approaches always. There is the carrot approach and the stick approach and the Democrats always want to use the stick, which is we're going to go after you if you even step out of line or you have an independent thought.Here's what the President has said, I'm going to deregulate the government so you can grow your business regardless of how you own it. I'm going to have empowerment zone, so we're going to put more money into minority communities.This President uses the carrot. It's two very different ways of doing things. We know the President's way works, but if you're not on Team Liberal, if you're not on Team AOC, you're not on Team Hate Trump, then we're going to use the stick against you and you'll be penalized for not supporting the Democratic line.WATTERS: Yes, Corey. I think they're scared because the President is making strong inroads in the Hispanic community. He is up 10 points to where I guess he was against Crooked Hillary. Biden is losing support with Hispanics. So they have to use these types of threats and this boycott movement.Cancel culture, Corey. That's what this is about. You've been canceled before, haven't you? You're always getting canceled.LEWANDOWSKI: Jesse, it looks like we canceled your time tonight. Look, Rudy and I are the only guys who bring in a class to the show.Between you and Bannon, you couldn't find a tie tonight? You guys got canceled on the tie.WATTERS: Sloppy Watters. That's what they call me.LEWANDOWSKI: No, good, Jesse. No, good.WATTERS: All right. I'll try to clean it up next week. Corey Lewandowski, everybody. Thank you.LEWANDOWSKI: Thank you.WATTERS: A liberal prosecutor sends police into the home of this St. Louis couple to take away their weapon. This is what the founders warned us about. A full report ahead on that.But first, a jewel thief says the Epstein tapes are real and he's seen them, next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WATTERS: New claims coming out about Ghislaine Maxwell from a jewel thief. He says Maxwell bragged about having video of at least two high profile politicians and other powerful figures, and that he has seen the tapes himself.An attorney for Prince Andrew accuser, Virginia Roberts says the Prince is one of them, and Roberts says, he should be worried.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)VIRGINIA ROBERTS GIUFFRE, JEFFREY EPSTEIN ACCUSER: We weren't anything important to them at all. We weren't even a human being to them. We were just another toy to be passed around. And that's what they did.Prince Andrew should be panicking at the moment because Ghislaine doesn't really care about anyone else but Ghislaine.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: So who else should be worried? Joining me now, Daniel Halper, co- author of the book \"A Convenient Death: The Mysterious Demise of Jeffrey Epstein.\" I've read it. It's excellent reporting by him and his co-author.All right, so this guy is a jewel thief. You can kind of judge the veracity for yourself. He told a tabloid in Great Britain about this. So this is what he said.He said, you know, Ghislaine and Epstein kind of boasted to him about owning powerful people. He said he saw videos of powerful people, celebrities, world figures, in videos having sex, threesomes, even orgies with minors. He saw videos and photos of people having sex with various young girls, and there is footage of two very high profile society figures with an underage girl and the two American politicians in videos with minors.You've done some reporting on Epstein and Ghislaine, what do you make of this, Daniel?DANIEL HALPER, AUTHOR: Well, listen, I can't vouch for his precise claims, obviously, but it's very consistent with what we know. We know that Ghislaine Maxwell was a procurer for Jeffrey Epstein. That's been alleged by many victims.And we know, worse that she partook in the sexual crimes against these women in many cases.I think one thing to consider is that Ghislaine Maxwell herself was found in America, and I think it's a very striking point. Why was she here in America when she had two other passports, in addition to an American passport? She had $20 million. She could have gotten anywhere in the world.And I think the answer is pretty obvious. She didn't fear getting caught here. She hadn't gotten caught for so long. The Feds had showed no interest in her for so long, and she had gotten away with her crimes.She clearly has something over some powerful people's heads that was able - - that allowed her to run free for so long. And I think it's very good that she is being brought to justice and hopefully, she does cooperate with prosecutors and they try to get to the bottom of this.WATTERS: Yes, I mean, she's in a horrible cell in a correctional facility, and they're not going to let anything happen to her after the mistake they made with Epstein.So, you've reported and other people have reported that every single property he owned from Paris to the Virgin Islands, in Mexico, Palm Beach to Manhattan was wired. Like this was like the real world house. This was this -- this was like, you know, the \"Big Brother.\" You have cameras in every single corner.So if you're a high profile individual and you ever went to an Epstein property over the last couple decades, and you did anything inappropriate with any underage person, there will be surveillance footage backed up somewhere on a hard drive which we have to assume the F.B.I. seized during their raids when they went after Jeffrey and took him into custody.The amount of explosive evidence that we're looking at here, and if this really is true that you're talking about well-known politicians and society types, does she have leverage if the F.B.I. already has the tapes? I guess the only leverage would be that she could testify against people.HALPER: Yes, look that's obviously a legal question. And then of course, there may be other situations of which there's not footage. There were accusations that some of these things took place in Ohio, for instance, that we don't -- that there hasn't been alleged that it is very well wired.I think one of the interesting things about Jeffrey Epstein's wiring of his place and a lot of victims and friends of his have claimed that is that Jeffrey Epstein would allow people at some point to know that they were filmed and that they were wired.It's very interesting. It wasn't just that he had everything on camera. He wanted people to know and I think he did it.WATTERS: Well, let me ask you this because you did some reporting quickly about questions about his ties to foreign intelligence activities. Ghislaine's father was alleged to have had some sort of ties to Israeli Intelligence, I think you reported.There's always been questions about Epstein's role in compromising people for a foreign country. Do these tapes kind of lead you to believe that?HALPER: They've led many people to believe that. I think there are very serious questions. Why did he evade the law for so long and people like Alex Acosta, when he was coming into the Trump administration, he told people in the Trump administration allegedly that he couldn't touch Epstein because he was tied to Intelligence.WATTERS: Wow.HALPER: So I think Bill Barr should be transparent about what's going on, given what's happened to Jeffrey Epstein. I think we should know what's going on, and I think that would be very helpful in getting justice hopefully.WATTERS: Yes. Because that's what this is about. This is about justice for these underage victims.All right, great reporting. Dan. Thanks again.HALPER: Thank you, Jesse.WATTERS: St. Louis homeowners have their rifle removed from their home by force. A dark day for the Bill of Rights in America. That shocking story, next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MARK MCCLOSKEY, ST. LOUIS MAN WHO DEFENDED HIS HOME: Seemingly, everybody in the world came forward. Literally, I think the estimate is 300 to 500 people came right towards us.PATRICIA MCCLOSKEY, ST. LOUIS WOMAN WHO DEFENDED HIS HOME: They were going to kill us. They were going to come in there. They were going to burn down the house. They were going to be living in our house after I was dead and they were going to -- they pointed to two different rooms and set up, that's going to be my bedroom, and that's going to be the living room and I'm going to be taking a shower in that room.And then the dog barked. I mean, there were so many threats and then the dog barked and they said and I'm going to be killing her, too.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Patricia and Mark McCloskey, the St. Louis couple forced to protect their home from protesters now unarmed. Police went into their home and took their rifle, and the pistol reportedly already handed over to their former attorney.But the couple was not arrested or charged. So what the heck is going on here? Joining me now with that by phone, former Florida Attorney General, Pam Bondi.So Pam, this crackpot DA out in St. Louis. She is running in a primary for re-election. She's a total joke. And I guess she got a judge to sign off on a warrant to send police in there to take this guy's rifle away from him. It's very unclear for what reason. This is like the red flag law without the red flag. How is this legal in this country?PAM BONDI, FORMER FLORIDA ATTORNEY GENERAL (via phone): It is not legal, Jesse. I've been a prosecutor as you know, my whole career and then Attorney General. This is an extreme abuse of power by this prosecutor, and this is a glimpse of what a Biden administration would look like.They want to take away our gun. That couple that you're showing on TV, they were defending their lives and they were defending their property, within Missouri under the Castle Doctrine, they had every right to do.These people weren't peaceful protesters. They crashed through their gated community. Armed -- armed -- came up. They told this couple, they were going to kill them. Kill them. They were even pointing out what bedroom they were going to live in, in this couple's home. They were going to kill the couple's dog.Look at them on this footage. It is outrageous.WATTERS: Yes.BONDI: These are good American citizens, Jesse. Look what they did. I'm proud of them.WATTERS: Yes, I mean, you're right about the law. There's the Castle Doctrine where you can defend your home. They have open carry in that neighborhood.BONDI: That's right.WATTERS: They have stand your ground there. These were legally purchased weapons. They have the right of the Second Amendment to have these weapons to protect their property and to protect their life.What it looks like to me is this ridiculous District Attorney whose conviction rates just dropping like a rock. She is not getting anything done. She's actually just let looters and rioters off the hook, no charges at all.There she is right there. Her name is Kimberly Gardner. She's funded by George Soros. This just looks like a political play to me to win votes. But I wish I knew more about this. It's just clearly unconstitutional. I'm outraged by it.I mean, this is the United States of America, you have the right to bear arms.BONDI: Jesse, every American should be outraged by this, every single American. This is our most fundamental right and not only that, they are protecting themselves. These people are protecting themselves outside their own home on their own property.WATTERS: Right.BONDI: This isn't even close to being legal. He had no legal basis to go in and seize their firearm. What about the people who came in there armed? The couple said those people were armed. They are the ones who should be under investigation.Let me tell you, we dealt with a Soros funded attorney, a District Attorney or state attorney in Florida in Orlando, and he is now no longer running for office. He wasn't prosecuting cases the way he should have. But that's what happening. George Soros around this country is funding these political prosecutors.WATTERS: Yes. They are putting everyone in danger, and they're just shredding the Bill of Rights. I mean, this is the country was founded upon, some of these rights. And the government can't do that. It's just not right.All right, Pam, thank you.Up next, Last Call.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WATTERS: It's a big week for birthdays. On Thursday, I turned 21. That's right, I can drink now.

Others considering it. We're similarly following developments in North Carolina, where we're told that schools will reopen in the fall, but with some caveats, also following developments in a host of other states that are playing kind of loosey- goosey with this, a mix of in-person classes, virtual classes. Bottom line, the president has said that he wants to see all schools reopen in the fall. It is now a given, at the very least, that some of the more populated school districts across the country will not heed his wishes. Welcome, everybody. I'm Neil Cavuto. And this is YOUR WORLD. Let's go to Jonathan Serrie with the latest on this, as well as the latest case count that has really spurred all this -- Jonathan. JONATHAN SERRIE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: It has, indeed, Neil. North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper's announcement came just within the past hour. He says that all students, regardless of whether they're kindergarten or as old as 12th grade, they're going to have to wear masks and social distance if they return to physical school buildings in the hall -- in the fall. As far as his plans for reopening, he really envisions a hybrid plan. Here's what he said: (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. ROY COOPER (D-NC): Today, we announced that North Carolina schools will be open for both in-person and remote learning, with key safety precautions to protect the health of our students, teachers, staff, and families. (END VIDEO CLIP) SERRIE: Later in the show, we will be hearing from the superintendent of the nation's second largest school district. The Los Angeles Unified School District has decided to stick with online instruction, as that city's positive test rate for coronavirus approaches 10 percent. That's twice the World Health Organization's maximum safe threshold for communities to reopen. But in neighboring Orange County, the school board voted to recommend schools reopen in the fall without mandates for face coverings or social distancing. And, in Detroit, protesters blocked school buses, as that city begins summer classes this week. New York City plans to offer a hybrid of both in- person and online learning in the fall. Four former CDC directors are criticizing the Trump administration for undermining federal health officials' recommendations on reopening schools and the economy. In a Washington Post op-ed today, they write: \"These repeated efforts to subvert sound public health guidelines introduce chaos and uncertainty, while unnecessarily putting lives at risk.\" Neil, you may recall, last week, President Trump tweeted that the CDC's guidance for school openings was -- quote -- \"very tough and expensive\" -- back to you. CAVUTO: Thank you, my friend, very much, Jonathan Serrie. We're going to be getting the read from the White House momentarily how the president is responding to this. In the meantime, I want to go to Austin Beutner, the L.A. Unified District superintendent. Superintendent, thank you for taking the time. What are you going to do? How does the fall look to you right now? AUSTIN BEUTNER, SUPERINTENDENT, LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT: \u00a0Thanks for having me. We're going to start online, because that's where health and safety take us. As your colleague mentioned, the rate of infection in our community is twice the World Health Organization guidelines for opening a community. So we have got to start there. And we know it's a struggle. We know we're balancing three sometimes conflicting objectives, the learning needs of students, the impact the virus is having on working families and the communities we serve, and the health and safety of all in the school community. We have to put health and safety first. CAVUTO: So, when the president says that districts that are not doing this, or states or locales that are not opening up are doing it politically and it's all politically motivated, what do you want to tell him? BEUTNER: We have got to get out of the politics and get into the realm of solving the solution, solving the problem, which is, we all want to be back in schools as soon as possible. We know where that's the best learning occurs. Whether that's the White House or here in Los Angeles, I think we could all agree on that. Let's focus on where the federal government can help get us back to school quicker. And if we look at examples around the world, they have done three things well. They have changed health practice in schools. They will spread the desks apart, wear the masks, put down the painter's tape, so people don't bump into each other in the hall, clean surfaces. That's been talked about a lot. The other two pieces, the other two legs of the stool are testing and contact tracing. And we think, until that's done in schools, it's going to keep us from getting back. But, if we do it, we can get back safer and quicker. CAVUTO: Superintendent, if the governor had not reimposed some restrictions on businesses and bars, indoor dining, on that sort of thing, would you have moved to delay the in-person school year? BEUTNER: Yes, we arrived at our decision, actually, before he made that announcement. We have been tracking the health factors for the last month or so. Back in May, it looked better. There was less incidence in the community. We were below the World Health Organization threshold. Since June, it's really skyrocketed, now being twice that threshold. So we have known for a period of weeks we're headed towards this point. Now that we see clear data, we made the decision. But we actually made that before the governor imposed the further restrictions on businesses. CAVUTO: Superintendent, we're learning today that New Hampshire, New Jersey and North Carolina all plan to open for in-person classes. I believe the North Carolina governor did leave open the possibility that districts, municipalities that feel otherwise, are uncomfortable with that, or dealing -- I'm paraphrasing here, sir -- a spike in cases and the like, that they can go the virtual route. But they are trying the in-person route first. You are not. Is it -- is it just a sense that the kids, it's a danger for them, it's a danger their exposure to teachers and administrators, the risk of them bringing it back home? What cinched it for you? BEUTNER: Well, just a couple things to mention. First is, this is a local disease that happens locally. So, the conditions in New Hampshire and North Carolina may be different than here in Los Angeles. If we were having this conversation in May or early June, I'd say, all systems go, we're going to be back in school facilities. It's now July, mid-July, and that has changed. The facts and circumstances have changed here in Los Angeles. The other thing that we're learning is more and more science and data becomes available to us. There was a study done on a village, a town in Italy; 15,000 people were all tested because they quarantined the whole village. Of those who tested positive, half of them showed no symptoms. That's a wakeup call for all of us that we have got to get that testing in place, because, even if we were to reopen facilities in a congregant setting and bring back multiple generations, a 10-year-old student with a 30-year-old teacher and a 50-year-old bus driver, going home to a 7-year-old grandmother, before we do that, we got to make sure that we're keeping all who may have the virus out of the school community. That includes those who show no symptoms, and testing is the only way to do that. CAVUTO: Mr. Beutner, thank you very much for taking the time, Austin Beutner, the L.A. Unified School superintendent. I want to go to the White House now in reaction to all of this. The president, as you know, has not been a fan of any school system that toys with the possibility of delaying the start of the in-person school year. Now you have three very big ones in Atlanta and, of course, Los Angeles right now that are saying -- San Diego as well -- we're not so sure about that. We're going to push things back. Kristin Fisher at the White House now with all the goings on there -- Kristin. KRISTIN FISHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Yes, well, despite those developments in California, the state's two largest school districts saying they are going to go online only in August, the White House is really continuing to push that all schools reopen for in-person classes this fall. And, right now, the vice president, Mike Pence, is in Louisiana making that case. He did wear a mask today, as his did almost everybody else that he was with, except for when he was speaking, which is important, because cases of coronavirus are on the rise there. And the point that the vice president was making is that, remember, New Orleans saw that really early surge in cases. It was one of the original hot spots. They were able to flatten or at least bend the curve. And the vice president said today that he believes that they will be able to bend it back down for a second time. As for schools, the vice president said that the governor of Louisiana informed us today that the plan in that state is to reopen schools on time. The vice president was joined by several members of the Coronavirus Task Force, the education secretary, Betsy DeVos. Dr. Birx was also there. But one key member of the Coronavirus Task Force was not there, Dr. Anthony Fauci. He is going to be speaking to students at Georgetown University in just a few minutes. And, yesterday, he was making the case that he believes an entire shutdown is not necessary, but he believes that, in order to reopen safely, there does need to be a little bit of a pullback. Listen here. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, NIAID DIRECTOR: I am really confident we can, if we step back. You don't necessarily need to shut down again, but pull back a bit, and then proceed in a very prudent way of observing the guidelines of going from step to step. (END VIDEO CLIP) FISHER: Meanwhile, you have the former Vice President and the president's 2020 opponent Joe Biden giving a big speech today on the economy. But he also really pushed back on the president's plan for not just reopening the country, but reopening schools this fall. Watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOSEPH BIDEN (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Mr. President, open everything now isn't a strategy for success. It's barely a slogan. Quit pushing the false choice between protecting our health and protecting our economy. All it does is endanger our recovery on both fronts. (END VIDEO CLIP) FISHER: So, Neil, it's going to be very interesting to see if President Trump decides to respond to some of those attacks from the former Vice President Joe Biden when President Trump speaks in the Rose Garden. That is set for 5:00 p.m., Neil. CAVUTO: All right, Kristin, thank you very much, Kristin Fisher at the White House. We will be monitoring those developments as well. Just a quick peek give, before we take a break, corner of Wall and Broad. It wasn't this confusion over school reopenings that had folks buying today. It was the promise of vaccines and treatments, no fewer than at least 15 of them either paired with other companies or governments, one showing such promise that it could be available by the fall. We're on that, also on top of the other big story gripping the nation, the continued violence in America's cities, two big ones on the West Coast that have a lot of folks wondering, will it ever end? After this. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) CAVUTO: If you're a foreign student and here in the United States, and you're studying at colleges online, and you're worried about the president's directive issued a little more than a week ago that he might be inclined to kick you out, you can relax. He relented a little bit. The president outlining his plan right now that he will not be doing that for international college students to leave the U.S. if they're still in the middle of their classes, whether they're online or not. He might detail that a little bit more when he addresses reporters in about 45 minutes. Separately, we were telling you right now about the spike in cases, particularly in Florida, which, in a lot of people's eyes, has made Miami suddenly the new Wuhan. That might be a bit of a stretch. But at Miami Beach, they're not taking any chances and, officially, as of today, prohibiting short-term rentals. Now, separately, we will have the mayor of the town of Miami, different from Miami Beach, what he makes of this and these other developments, where they're limiting beach access and social distancing amid these new waves of cases that are going on there. So, it -- these are pretty powerful developments. Then there's the issue of violence in this country, more an issue out West with what's been happening in Seattle and now in Portland. Jonathan Hunt on some very big ones that have police concerned this is getting out of control -- Jonathan. JONATHAN HUNT, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Neil, clashes between police and protesters in Portland last night came during what is the seventh consecutive week of demonstrations in the city. Police said rocks, bottles and ball bearings were thrown at them. They threatened to use tear gas to disperse the crowd, but did not ultimately need to do so. In a separate incident northeast of Seattle, two police officers were involved in a traffic stop. When backup officers arrived, they found that two colleagues had both been shot. One of those to die. The other was treated at a hospital and has now been released. Neither has been identified at this point. The suspect was arrested several hours later. Now, according to the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund, 70 officers have died in the line of duty in 2020, up to July 13. That's down 14 percent from the same period in 2019. Thirty of those killed this year died in firearms incidents, one more than the 29 killed over the same period in 2019. Twenty-seven died in traffic-related accidents, 13 due to other causes. Now, it's worth noting, Neil, that the Officers Memorial Fund keeps a separate tally of those officers who've died as a result of exposure to COVID-19 in the line of duty. That number currently stands at 63, making coronavirus, according to the Memorial Fund, by far the leading cause of law enforcement deaths in 2020 -- Neil. CAVUTO: Thank you, my friend, very, very much. In the meantime, I want to go right now to Mike Solan. He's the Seattle Police Officers Guild president, joining us now via Skype. Mike, it doesn't seem to ease up in your town. And I'm wondering now, efforts to cut the police budget, and maybe substantially, in Seattle, if that's really helping matters any. MIKE SOLAN, PRESIDENT, SEATTLE POLICE OFFICERS GUILD: Hey, Neil. Thanks for having me on again. No, it's absolutely making things worse. And the socialist-leaning city council has our entire reasonable community, which I now referred to as the ignored majority of the citizens of Seattle, hostage by their unreasonable activism. Now they're talking about removing funding 50 percent of us, which would remove two-thirds of the police jobs, which would make the CHOP or CHAZ, if you want to refer to that situation, basically child's play to what kind of crime would besiege our entire city. And you could just imagine what we're all feeling at this point, due to our job security at this point. So it's a very troubling time. And I hope people across this nation realize that Seattle is leading the way as far as how public safety will be conducted coming to you. It's very troubling. CAVUTO: And it is playing out across the country, whether people are fond of the police or not. It's no coincidence there's been an uptick in more violence right now, as there's an all-out assault on police budgets. I'm just wondering, in New York, where they have pared a billion from the police budget, now they're looking to pare more -- obviously, you're familiar with what's going on in Seattle. This is playing out in no fewer than 23 U.S. cities. What's going on? SOLAN: And this has been -- yes, it's a national trend, and it's basically socialism on steroids. It's not at our doorstep anymore. They have breached the door and they're coming through. And please understand that this must be stopped. America needs to wake up as to what is occurring. And if we lose 50 percent of our department, we're talking 1,100 officers gone. Who's left to answer the 911 call to investigate that child rape? You can just imagine. So, please, I understand that if people -- people need to get involved. This ignored majority across our city, and, more importantly, across our nation need to rise up. And if you want to get involved, please assist at = . Please stand up to this unreasonable socialist activism. CAVUTO: I don't know what's going on in Seattle. Mike. I'm familiar with what's happening in New York City, where better than 400 officers have already requested retirement. Some of them are eligible for it, but had held off on it. Now they're flooding the system with such requests. But we're similarly seeing new rookie classes being pared down, frustration over whether it's a good thing to even be a police officer these days. What do you make of all this? SOLAN: Well, I make of it it's dividing us more than uniting us. I mean, we're definitely having people that are retiring early here, looking for jobs elsewhere. But, more importantly, Neil, is that the defund movement is based upon how they view as law enforcement, which they do not respect anymore. And, more importantly, there's a certain city council member that heads the public safety chair on our council that is looking at the possibility of, when officers are terminated or furloughed, based upon this 50 percent cut, they want to dictate those cuts based upon the person's race, which is astronomically, horrifically bad, which violates all laws and just common sense. But that's where we are. That's the level of insanity that we're plagued with by this unreasonable, activist city council that has our ignored majority hostage. And it's very troubling. And you can just imagine the mental health that's impacting our officers is at an all-time high. And you know that suicides by police officers are all -- at the highest level they have ever been. And you can just imagine, with all the protests we have had to deal with, the assaults, the amount of vitriol that was plagued against our membership, now we're dealt with this defund movement, which is national now, which is all socialist-backed propaganda and well-funded, is now we have to deal with this as far as losing our jobs. So, the hits just keep on coming. But I need America rise up here. The ignored majority needs to wake up as to what's occurring. CAVUTO: Mike, thank you very, very much. I always hate talking under these circumstances, but I learn a lot, Mike Solan, the Seattle Police Officers Guild president. Just to keep you up, there are a lot of unintended consequences to the type of violence Mike was outlining, including innocent people caught in the crossfire, and the latest example in New York, a 1-year-old little boy -- after this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0 UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I can't hear him calling me daddy no more. I can't kiss him no more. I can't play with him no more. I can't do nothing with him no more. Like, I have got to put my -- I got to put my son in the ground now. (END VIDEO CLIP) (COMMERCIAL BREAK) CAVUTO: All right, you might want to add Dr. Anthony Fauci to the list of those concerned about putting off kids being in person for school, saying in Georgetown that to keep children in school, because of the impact of keeping children out, that's what's important -- after this. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DAVELL GARDNER SR., FATHER OF SHOOTING VICTIM: I got to put my son in the ground now. And he's only 1, his birthday, two months -- in two months. He didn't live to see 2. Like, he didn't live life. And it's like I wanted to get him out this violence before something like this happened. SAMANTHA GARDNER, GRANDMOTHER OF SHOOTING VICTIM: For the cowards that did this, you should be ashamed of yourself because everybody talk about black lives matter. What about baby lives? (END VIDEO CLIP) CAVUTO: Lawrence Jones has been talking about this for weeks now. When it comes to black lives matter, which matter? Shouldn't they all matter? He joins us right now. Lawrence, this case is particularly shocking, because it's a 1-year-old boy caught up in the crossfire, both literally and figuratively, and now dead. For what, right? For what? LAWRENCE JONES, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Neil, I reported last week about Chicago, what is happening in there. And right now, we're seeing it hit right home here in New York City. Crime, when it comes to shooting, are up 130 percent. I just got some new numbers from the sources, and they say now it's up to 161 percent. This kid was in a stroller when he was gunned down in the middle of a fight. And they still haven't been able to catch the suspects, because no one in the community is talking. Neil, as I continue to say on the network -- and I have been very vocal when it comes to the state abusing its power -- when police get it wrong, I'm on the network reporting on it, getting all the facts. But when an innocent young black life is taken from us, I have to report on that too. And the fact that you're not seeing outrage across the country is concerning to me. Just because this happened in the projects, just because these people were in a poor neighborhood does not mean they're not entitled to life and the same liberties that our audience and people that are in rich neighborhoods are entitled to. CAVUTO: Now that dad to bury a little boy. And I'm wondering. Given everything that's going on, does he blame anyone? Is he just overwhelmed? Does he just think, how did this get so bad so quickly? What? JONES: Well, the dad and the grandmother blame the political leadership. And it's not about a partisan issue. It's the fact that the elected leaders aren't doing anything to prevent this from happening. The AOCs of the world say that this crime is happening because of the coronavirus. Well, that's just simply not true. The crime has been happening in these neighborhoods for a while. And people aren't doing anything about it. The elected leaders don't care about the death, poverty and destruction that have been happening in these communities for a long time. Neil, I don't just talk about these cities, Philly, Detroit, Chicago, New York City. I go to these cities and I talk with the people. And they're begging -- they don't care what ideology you believe in -- for someone to stop the bleeding. And you know what? Neither political party has been able to do it. You got the Democrats that run these neighborhoods. They have failed on it. And then you have the Republicans that don't show up to help solve the problem. So, again, they don't want a political solution. They want a human solution. And I think everybody should care about all of these black lives. CAVUTO: And, as you pointed out, Lawrence, the other day, I mean, this is not an isolated incident. Violent crimes, homicides are up better than 118 percent just over the last six weeks in the New York metropolitan area, up about 70-plus percent in Chicago. It's playing out again and again. And it seems to be spreading. I just talked to a Seattle police chief, who is very concerned about budget cuts there, and how it's going to lead, and has already led to more violence there. This does seem to be permeating the nation. JONES: Well, I will tell you this, Neil. You know me. I'm a libertarian. I'm not ashamed of my ideology. And I believe in cutting. But it doesn't make any sense to cut from the police department when crime is a problem. There's a bunch of other line items that they can cut from right now. If they could point to results by cutting from the police department, then I would be for it. But, right now, it hasn't bared much fruit. You got a billion dollars that has been cut from the New York Police Department. And right now, crime is skyrocketing, especially when it comes to violent crime. So, again, I asked the mayor, is there anything -- maybe look at your wife's proposals that she's gotten. And they're getting millions and millions of dollar. Cut from those areas. But don't come from a police department that is already underwhelmed -- overwhelmed by crime. There are so many unsolved cases currently. Yesterday, just by the numbers, 18 people were shot, one person was killed in New York. Those crimes have not been solved. So, again, does it make sense to continue to cut from a police department that is already begging for more help? CAVUTO: Lawrence Jones, thank you, my friend. I appreciate it, and the insight. JONES: Thanks, brother. CAVUTO: We will keep track of this, because it is spreading everywhere, and the numbers are numbing. All right, when we also come back, Senator Rand Paul will be joining us, talking about what's going on right now, the latest push for stimulus in Washington. He's not a fan of some of the numbers he's been hearing -- after this. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) CAVUTO: All right, there is more stimulus coming. We can tell you that. We don't know how much, but we do know that more is on the way. And maybe by the end of the summer, it will all be put together. Here's the thing, though. We don't have any money to pay for it. In the most recent month of June, we were spending $864 billion more than we were taking in. In other words, the deficit for just one month was $864 billion. It's a familiar theme in what is now increasingly looking like at least a $3 trillion annual deficit. And that might be conservative. Blake Burman on what this could mean going forward. Hey, Blake. BLAKE BURMAN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Hi there, Neil. On that one month of June, just to put that in perspective, more than some fiscal years in total, fiscal years in recent memory. In any event, that eye-popping numbers is not going to slow down the White House as it relates to putting out a phase four relief proposal here, if not in the upcoming days, certainly in the upcoming weeks. The White House spokesperson, Judd Deere, sending me this statement this afternoon, saying -- quote -- \"The White House is sensitive to the rising deficit, which certainly furthers the president's priority that any phase four package be targeted, and one that advances pro-growth policies and incentivizes reemployment.\" The top Republican on the House Ways and Means Committee is Kevin Brady, spoke with you earlier today on \"Cavuto Coast to Coast.\" He continued to tout this idea of a reemployment bonus, which is popular among many Republicans here in Washington. Watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. KEVIN BRADY (R-TX): We know then when unemployment benefits end, the people tend to look for work pretty aggressively. And, right now, we know mainstream businesses are having trouble getting their workers to come back. I do you think a return-to-work bonus or some economic incentive to reconnect those workers is important for both them and that business in a key way. (END VIDEO CLIP) BURMAN: So that's what Republicans are talking about. But Democrats here in Washington are pushing for an extension of that $600 unemployment insurance benefit, that federal plus-up that expires at the end of the month, certainly possible that both sides could meet in the middle. The House speaker, Neil, by the way, Nancy Pelosi, said today that if there is not a deal before Congress takes its summer break in August, that traditional August recess, then she would be in favor of keeping the House here in Washington, before letting them skip town for the entirety of the month. Bottom line here. Neil, both sides hoping to get a deal in the upcoming weeks -- Neil. CAVUTO: All right. Thank you, my friend, Blake Burman, outside the White House reporting on all of that. Let's go to Senator Rand Paul on this. Of course, he's quite a fiscal hawk when it comes to such matters. And that generally gets the ire of even some in his party. So, it's a good time to ask him about this latest stimulus push. What do you think, Senator? Are you for more stimulus? SEN. RAND PAUL (R-KY): Well, we have no money, Neil. There's no rainy day fund. There's no savings account. It's not like we go over to the Federal Reserve, open the safe, and we find out, oh, we have all this money we can give to people. The $3 trillion we have already sent to people because of this government mandated depression has been borrowed. Where are they going to get another trillion dollars? They're going to borrow it. And so I think it's a really, really rotten thing to do. What you have to do is look at the source. The source of the economic depression is the government and the government shutdown of the economy. The government, and particularly the governors, need to get out of the way, let the economy open up, and let individuals assess their risk and act accordingly. CAVUTO: So, when there's talk about extending unemployment benefits, which are very generous on the federal level, or what some of your Republican colleagues have come up with, an incentive to get people to go back to work, you're against both? PAUL: Well, if you pay people not to work, they won't work. If you pay people more not to work than they get for working normally, they won't work. It's called institutional unemployment. So, right now, the institutional unemployment, if you make less than about $50,000 a year, you have got no business working. Why work if the government will give you a free $50,000? If the Democrats get their way, and unemployment goes on for months and months and months, if not years, what will happen is, nobody will work for less than $50,000 in this country, because you can get that for not working. The Republicans' idea, only slightly less stupid. The Republicans are going to give you a bonus to go back to work. Well, where are they getting the money? They're going to borrow it from you. They're going to borrow it from your kids. They're going to borrow it from China. It's a ridiculous notion that we just keep passing out money. Let's get rid of the root cause of this depression. Sometimes, we don't know exactly the cause of the depression. In this one, we do know the cause, the government. The government shut the economy down. The government needs to get the hell out of the way and let us all go back to work, and let each and every one of us assess the risk and make decisions accordingly. CAVUTO: Senator, you're also a doctor. And many school districts and municipalities, including some big ones, Los Angeles and San Diego and Atlanta, are among those saying, we're going to delay the school year because we don't like the spike in cases we're seeing. We think it's risky. So, we're going to put it off. How do you feel about that? PAUL: Well, the teachers union in California also said they won't go back to work until we defund the police and have Medicare for all. So, we have to put this into a bit of perspective. But what I would say is, the media have been scaring people to death. The mortality for children 0 to 18 is one in a million or less. The mortality between 18 years of age and 45 is about 10 in 100,000. So, we need to assess those risks and make decisions. The countries that have opened schools -- 22 countries have opened schools in Europe, and they're doing just fine. They haven't had a surge. The other interesting thing is, when you do contact -- contact tracing, in China, the Netherlands, Britain and in Iceland, what you find is, kids not only rarely get this, rarely die from it, but they rarely transmit it. They're just not good transmitters. And, in general, people who are asymptomatic are not good transmitters. So, the day cares stayed open in New York throughout this for doctors' kids, nurses' kids, hospital janitors' kids, anybody that was associated, firemen, police. The day care stayed open. CAVUTO: Right. PAUL: And guess what? Had very little coronavirus and very few staff members -- about 1 percent of staff members were infected. And most of these staff members, if they're in a reasonable age group, are at very, very low risk of succumbing to this disease. CAVUTO: Well, actually, that puts you kind of on the same page as Dr. Fauci. I know two had your disagreements. He is for opening schools in person. But he did say this about , I guess, an answer to a question about whether he's being slighted by the White House. He said: \"You can trust respected medical authorities. I believe I'm one of them. So, you can trust me. But you need to stick to the data, the science, medical authorities who have a track record of telling the truth. The public can get mixed messages and get confused.\" What do you think of that? PAUL: Well, look, I think Dr. Fauci is well-intentioned. I don't think he's a bad person. I think he wants what's best for the country. But his perspective is that of someone who's always worked for the government and never worked outside of government. So, there's a Dr. Scott Atlas, who is a professor at Stanford, as part of the Hoover Institute, who has a much different and I think much more reasoned perspective. So, what we do is, we listen to a lot of these people. But, ultimately, if we're going to live in a free country, none of these people should get to make a decision for us, for us individually. Each individual should assess the risks and make their choices. Frankly, if you're 18 years old, the rules should be or the advice should be much different than if you're 80 years old, and if you're in a nursing home and you're 85 years old. And so it isn't one-size-fits-all. We can't say, oh, everybody needs to stay at home because someone at the nursing home might get sick. No, let's try to be careful and protect those in the nursing home, but let's open the economy, open the schools. There's a possibility -- and we don't know this yet -- but there's a possibility that this great spike in infections that we're seeing throughout the South, that it may well be enhancing immunity. And it may well be that they reach what I think New York has already reached, a point at which the disease will begin to burn itself out. Interestingly, no one's saying this, but it may not be herd immunity of 60 percent. It may be a break point for the disease that's much less than that. And there are mathematicians who look at this, and they say that the models of herd immunity are based on random behavior and random vaccination. When you get herd immunity from the disease, it's not randomly distributed. And you have some who are very social and some who are less social. But the bottom line is, historically, diseases and viruses have burnout at 25 percent immunity, when you look back at our past. No one knows what the future holds, but I tend to be optimistic that we might get to 20, 25 percent immunity, and the disease may be -- we may be well over -- may be able to overcome the disease at that point. CAVUTO: Very quickly, we will be talking to the mayor of Miami. Now, it's Miami Beach that has already put out a proviso no short-term rentals here, fearing that the thing is -- it's worsening. It's different from Miami, I grant you, but do you think that is an overreaction? PAUL: I think we don't know until we see the death rate. I think that infection rate and testing are complicated, whether things are going up or down. CAVUTO: Right. PAUL: I do believe they are going up and people are infected. Even in my town here, Bowling Green in Kentucky, we meet people every day who are infected. And, to a person, they're all getting better. They're getting mild disease and getting better. So, if they're -- if this is a mild disease in Miami, don't shut it down. If you have an increase in your death rate, and it's significant, maybe you should. CAVUTO: All right. PAUL: But, so far, Florida's doing way better than New York. You wouldn't know that if you watch CNN, but Florida is doing way better than New York. New York had a disaster, a public policy disaster, public health disaster in their nursing homes, due to Democrat Governor Cuomo's decisions. Florida is doing a lot better. But you won't get that from the media that has become so biased and cannot report any of this objectively. CAVUTO: All right. PAUL: It's a disaster. CAVUTO: Senator Rand Paul, thank you very much. I believe the senator was referring to total cases, total hospitalizations, total deaths. Now, when we come back again, the move in Miami Beach right now, not only shut down those beaches, but also prevent people from coming down there for short-term vacation rentals. The mayor of Miami, separate from the beach, on what he makes of that -- after this. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) CAVUTO: All right, first the beaches, and now Miami Beach is telling short-term renters, better luck next time. We really don't want any short- term rentals. So, if you're looking at it, cancel it now. Francis Suarez is the mayor of Miami, again, separate from Miami Beach here. He joins us right now. Mayor, always good to have you. What do you think of this move? Is it justified? FRANCIS SUAREZ (R), MAYOR OF MIAMI, FLORIDA: I think the reason why they're doing it is because South Beach attracts a lot of tourists. And it's very, very difficult to control the crowds. There's large crowds of people... CAVUTO: Right. SUAREZ: ... that are gathered together. So, the whole idea of social distancing kind of goes out the window in South Beach. And I think that's what they're trying to get ahold of. CAVUTO: Do you support a move like that? It's a little different in your neck of the woods. Are you, as well, looking at those who might be coming to your city for a vacation, short- term rentals and the like, that you would consider the same? SUAREZ: Yes, I think, for us, we're always looking at -- and one of the things we have in our city is sort of underground parties, where, basically, bars have been closed by order of the governor. And we see people that basically try to create, recreate a bar in a warehouse. And so we shut down two of those this weekend. We shut down about 10 businesses over the weekend. So, we have been trying to dramatically enforce or increase our enforcement to make sure that, you know, things don't get worse in the city, which is obviously seeing -- and in Dade County, which is obviously seeing record number of cases over the last few days. CAVUTO: You know, Mayor, the greater Miami area has been compared to sort of like the new Wuhan, the new hotbed area of the virus. Do you think that's fair? SUAREZ: You know, that was one of the epidemiologists down here that said that. I think that was -- I don't know if she said that as an epidemiological opinion, expert opinion. But I think -- I think there was 50,000 cases a day in Wuhan. We're nowhere near that, obviously. We're at 3,500. CAVUTO: Right. SUAREZ: I think, in New York, you had a death rate that was at 8 percent. Our death rate is somewhere in the 2 percent range, and our death rate has been stable. We do have an issue with our hospitals very, very close to or very nearing capacity. And we are trying to create more capacity. And we do -- we may have to take some dramatic measures, if things don't improve over the next few weeks. And that's something that we're hoping that we can all together -- we had the governor today. We just came from a meeting with the governor and with all the mayors -- or all the major mayors of major cities -- of many of the major cities in Dade County, so that we can at least communicate whatever we're going to do with one message, because I think it is very important for us to communicate clearly and coherently one message, so that people will follow it. CAVUTO: Are you for kids going back to school in Miami this fall in person? SUAREZ: You know, we had a big discussion about that just a few minutes ago. Right now, obviously, we have a tremendously high amount of cases. I can tell you, personally, my daughter is still not school-ready. So she's not going to be going to school. And, actually, she could have been going into preschool. And my wife is thinking of holding her back. My son, who's 6, will probably do virtual learning, if things don't get better. But there are many families in our community that are in lower income, and they may not have another choice to be able to not send their kids to school, if they want to work. So, right now, what I have understood so far is that parents will be given an option as to whether their kids can go to school or not. That may change, given the circumstances. Obviously, schools are six weeks away from opening. And that's -- hopefully, we will see a significant improvement before that day comes. CAVUTO: Because the governor, I believe, DeSantis, is still on board with schools reopening for in-person classes, as things stand now. Do you support that? SUAREZ: Yes, he definitely -- he definitely does feel that way. He reiterated that. For me, it's more about the circumstances. I -- today, as of right now, with the cases the way they are, and the fact that we're still in phase one, under the CDC guidelines promulgated by the federal government, schools would not be open. CAVUTO: Right. SUAREZ: So, I think we have to see how things are going to evolve over the next six weeks. I can tell you that, if things don't get better over the next week to four weeks, we're going to have a hospital problem, and we're going to have to potentially consider taking some very extreme measures. So, we're trying to communicate to our residents that this is the time for them to take this seriously, to wear their mask in public, and to distance socially, and wash your hands. And we also are seeing that a large percentage of the transmission is at home, people going back home, from a family member. So, we're also messaging that out, so that people are more careful when they get home, and don't just pretend like they didn't potentially get exposed from the outside. CAVUTO: All right, Mayor, best of luck, and to your two little ones there, as you balance that. You're a parent, too, after all, so you have a lot to juggle. Mayor Suarez, thank you very, very much. SUAREZ: Thank you, Neil. CAVUTO: Just focusing on the White House right now. We're minutes away from a presidential press conference. China will be the big issue right now. We have been getting very in your face with the Chinese right now on a whole host of issues, from Hong Kong, to setting up military installations in islands all across the South China Sea. Our Charlie Gasparino has been following all of this, because trade, I guess, Charlie, hangs in the balance, right? CHARLIE GASPARINO, FOX NEWS SENIOR CORRESPONDENT: Yes, I mean, we're a long way from the phase one victory lap that the Trump administration had before the coronavirus. It's -- we are now at a point where there is all-out trade war with China, and it's war on a number of levels. It's an economic war. It's preventing Chinese companies maybe from operating here, like the music app TikTok, as the Trump administration believes that that music app is taking information from its users, mainly kids, but also social influencers, and giving it to the surveillance part of the Chinese government. The Trump administration really blames the Chinese for the coronavirus outbreak. They're on pretty good ground on that one. So, this is not a good time for Chinese-American relations. I will say this. I find it fascinating that the Democrats are chiming in as well. Joe Biden, if you saw some of his economic plans, it's all about stopping trade with China or limiting trade with China. There is a populist consensus in this country that China has done us wrong with the virus, with other -- with other measures. And I think you're going to see that play out through the election. Both sides see it as fertile ground for voters. And to be honest with you, the Trump administration was the first real -- first time anybody -- any administration called out China so blatantly. No one else did in the past. They deserve credit for that. I'm not saying we should have gone the full tariff route. But we -- but the Trump administration went out there and clearly labeled China as a bad player, as a menace to the world economy. Listen, if there's -- there's no better proof than the coronavirus outbreak, which emanated there. So I think you're going to hear Donald Trump ramp up the rhetoric in this. I mean, clearly, from his economic aides, you could -- I have been speaking with them off the record, but Larry Kudlow has been saying it on the record. This is not a good time for the Chinese -- for Chinese-American relations. I can't imagine they're going to is going to be phase two of a trade deal with them, given just how much animosity is out there. So... (CROSSTALK) CAVUTO: And, by the way, Charlie, you're right on that. Catherine Herridge from CBS was interviewing the president on that subject, and he ruled out a phase two trade deal right now, to your quick point here, because phase one just is going nowhere right now. We're waiting for them to deliver the goods, and they're not, right? Real quick. GASPARINO: Yes. I mean, phase one wasn't that big of a deal anyway. It was supposed to be the setup for phase two. But it's the relationship between the two countries now, which has been totally soured by corona, by further talk of espionage. I mean, all's you have to do is look at a music app TikTok, right? CAVUTO: All right. GASPARINO: It's young -- used by young kids. That may be banned because of this. That shows you how far they're going to go in this war -- Neil, back to you. CAVUTO: Oh, it's out of control. All right, thank you, buddy, Charlie Gasparino. We are waiting to hear from the president on this. He will outline all of these plans. Might be an opportunity for him to respond to questions about all these school systems that are delaying their in-person opening. Now, he said that would be a mistake.

For generations, what shocked the people in charge of this country was political violence, hurting your neighbors for having different opinions. They were appalled by that and they were right to be.Political violence isn't simply an assault on individual Americans, it's an attack on America itself. In this country, we govern by consent, not by force. People with guns don't make our laws, voters do.You may have a Glock in your hand, but on Election Day, you have precisely as many votes as the little old lady who disagrees with you. That's our system. The weak are supposed to have as much power over the government as the strong, and that is the basis of our equality as Americans, something that we should cherish and protect.Political violence immediately short circuits this. It ends democracy. Violence instead returns us to the most primitive of all systems, one in which might makes right. People who hurt others get to do exactly what they want. Everyone else has to obey them. There is no greater threat to civilization than this and we used to understand that because it's obvious.But things have changed. The people who run this country are no longer shocked by political violence. They welcome it. They slyly encourage it. They are its beneficiaries.They tell us the only real crimes are thought crimes. It's okay to set fires or smash strangers in the face with two by fours, so long as you are chanting the correct slogans. If you're on the right team, everything is allowed.But if you dare to dissent from the orthodoxy, you will be swiftly punished. Go ahead and express the wrong opinion. Try it in a meeting, try it on Facebook, they will find you. You will lose your job, your reputation, possibly even your life.The message they're sending you is very clear. Americans are not equal anymore. There are two standards in this country, one standard for them and a very different standard for you.Over the weekend, we saw exactly what they will excuse from their own supporters. Armed mobs of Joe Biden voters torched, buildings, smashed cars, attacked police officers. They rioted. They hurt people, a lot of people -- and the media, watching closely lied about all of it. They pretended it didn't happen. They made excuses for it. They buried the truth in euphemism.The liars of \"The New York Times\" described the riots as quote, \"protests,\" as if the violence was justified or could be justified. Here's the truth about what happened. Here's what actually happened in Seattle over the weekend. Take a look.[VIDEO CLIP PLAYS]CARLSON: Protests? No, these were not protests. These were scenes from a war. The rioters threw rocks, bottles, wood, explosives at police. One explosion left an eight inch hole in a police precinct.Because no lie is too absurd for CNN to tell, the network described violence against police as quote, \"a demonstration against police violence.\" Got that? It's a perfect inversion of the truth worthy of 1984. Ignorance is strength. Freedom is slavery. War is peace.They repeat it because they expect you to believe it and no doubt some do.Meanwhile, Seattle Police Department gamely tried to push back by releasing actual body cam footage of the violence. It is not clear how many people saw it. So, we're going to show some of you -- we're going to show some of it to you right here.[VIDEO CLIP PLAYS]CARLSON: A total of 59 police officers were injured in this demonstration against police violence. CNN would like you to believe they attacked themselves, they did not, not in Seattle, not anywhere.In Oakland, the mobs with helmets and shields attacked a police station. They shot cops with fireworks. They set fire to a courthouse. Here are pictures of it.[VIDEO CLIP PLAYS]CARLSON: According to NBC News, the rioters you just saw were quote, \"protesters.\" They burned the courthouse quote, \"after a peaceful demonstration intensified.\" Oh intensified, just like the World Trade Center collapsed when a commercial airline flight intensified.It's remarkable. You've got to believe there are still normal people working at ABC News, maybe in the tape library or in the cafeteria. Are they watching their own coverage? How can they stand it? The apologies for violence, the relentless shameless lying?It's hard to believe they haven't resigned. They probably have mortgages and kids who feel for them. Just as you feel for the cameraman who would flee the mob in Sacramento over the weekend.They were surrounded and apparently assaulted by 150 Joe Biden voters dressed in black paramilitary gear, and had to run for their lives. You'd think other journalists would be sympathetic to this, they used to be? Not anymore.The stakes are too high. We've got an election coming up and so instead they lie to provide cover for the rioters, the ones who threatened the cameraman.The Sacramento Bee took pains to tell you that the protests are actually peaceful. The newspaper did its best to downplay the violence, including the fact that so-called protesters are trying to disarm police helicopters with laser pointers.One of the peaceful protesters ran through the streets with a chainsaw in order to block traffic, no problem. Nothing to see here.Meanwhile, at mostly peaceful protests in Austin and Aurora, Colorado people were shot. In downtown Louisville, heavily armed militia and military outfits walked through the city threatening violence if police officers weren't sent to jail. No problem, just a protest. In Milwaukee, a black Trump supporter named Bernell Trammell was executed in front of his office in broad daylight. He was killed.In Portland, Oregon, police seized a bag filled with rifle magazines and Molotov cocktails, not a big deal.City leaders in Portland ignored 60 straight days of rioting. It's fine, they say. Really? Here is how Portland looked over the weekend.[VIDEO CLIP PLAYS]CARLSON: This isn't fine. It's not normal. It's not a protest. These aren't children. These are adults, and they're destroying our country. They're completely out of control. They're violent.Are they punished? No. Where's the Justice Department in this? Don't we have an Attorney General? Isn't he supposed to be conservative? Why are we allowing this?Chad Wolf runs the Department of Homeland Security. Wolf, whatever you think of him has been one of the very few officials in Washington, who seems to notice that any of this is happening. He sent Federal law enforcement to Portland to keep the mob from burning down the Federal Courthouse there, which the mob does not own. It is Federal property. They have no right to torch it. It's not theirs. It's ours.For doing that, for being one of the very few to actually push back a little bit, he was punished. The mob came to Chad Wolf's home yesterday, and they threatened him and his family and they didn't do it suddenly. It wasn't subtext. They said it out loud on camera. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We must make social consequences for these men and women.GROUP: Yes, yes.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We must make it uncomfortable for them. We will not be good Germans. We are angry neighbors. You can't live here quietly and is able to live just like us.(END VIDEO CLIP)CARLSON: Oh, she is trying to figure out why the Department of Justice isn't actually doing anything? Why they haven't frog marched the leaders of Antifa in front of the camera? Why they haven't stopped this stuff? While they're acting like they're powerless?Maybe they don't want mobs like this in front of their houses. Maybe mob violence works. \"We must make it uncomfortable for them,\" she says in a megaphone. What does that mean? Well, we don't need to guess because we just spent all weekend watching what it means.Here's the contrast that we should never forget. Things change so quickly. You imagine things have always been this way, but they haven't.There's a presidential election a few months from now. If you disagree with what Chad Wolf has done, you get to vote against Chad Wolf's boss, and Chad Wolf will be out of a job. That's the way we used to do it, when this was a democracy. But not anymore. Now they just go and threaten Chad Wolf's children and the media applaud.Last month, a radio show host in Seattle called Paul Gallant mocked reports that his city was descending into chaos. These were peaceful protests, he suggested. On Twitter, Gallant reported that he saw, quote, \"no burning, pillaging or deaths.\" Of course those things were happening. They existed. We showed you tape of it at the time.But Gallant pretended otherwise. We don't know why we'd have to assume because he thought it would help his team. Then the rioters showed up in the building where he lives, in his apartment building and they destroyed the Starbucks downstairs and that scared him.Now, Gallant says he is buying a gun. Ah, it turns out it's not so easy to lie about violence when it's aimed at you.Jason Rantz is a Seattle based radio host. We're happy to have him on tonight. Jason, thanks so much for coming on. So you just had a lot of violence in the City of Seattle over the weekend. Tell us what you saw and tell us what the reaction from local government was, please.JASON RANTZ, SEATTLE RADIO SHOW HOST: Well, it's almost like we're dealing with a masterclass of gaslighting because I know what I saw and I know what a lot of people who saw the images that I posted online saw, which was violence, which was arson against five construction trailers, which was a Starbucks that was completely ransacked, and someone tried to set it on fire and they didn't know of course stop at Starbucks. They also impacted some other businesses.But we're being told that it's peaceful or maybe it's just a few people, it's a few bad apples in a larger crowd. As if they were redecorating the Starbucks with their rocks, as if they were celebrating police by throwing fireworks at them.What we're seeing is violence. What we saw was a riot and anyone who says otherwise is lying to you. I understand that there's some nuance to go into when you're talking about a very large crowd and there are like two or three bad actors, but the entire crowd is almost full of bad actors.It started off peaceful on Saturday, as they walked to the Juvenile Detention Center. There was about 4,000 to 5,000 people. Then they set it on fire. And then all of a sudden, that crowd was about 1,500.The people who stayed are the bad actors. The people who stayed are the rioters. The people who stayed were saying some horrible things and their goal was not to protest against police brutality. This has nothing to do with George Floyd. This has everything to do with a very specific ideology, and I think that there are politicians and media members who believe that this is going to create enough momentum and chaos to get Donald Trump out of office.I think it's a mistake. I think it's going to backfire on them, but I do think some of them are willing to sit by and see some of these cities complete get destroyed. And yes, some people lose their lives. It's an evil position to take, all because they are justifying, well, if we can get Donald Trump out of office, this guy who was supposed to lead us to the end of civilization, it didn't quite actually happen over the period of the last three and a half years. But this time, it'll happen if he gets reelected. They've convinced themselves this.CARLSON: I don't know what kind of person could justify harming individuals in the name of winning a presidential campaign. I don't think any decent person on either side would ever do that, and I mean it.'RANTZ: He will be --CARLSON: I think that's right. I think that's right. Great to see tonight. Thank you.RANTZ: Good to see.'CARLSON: Well, speaking of violence, one of the epicenters of it in this country, and this has been true for a while now, tragically is Chicago. Two thousand two hundred and forty three people have been shot in the city of Chicago so far this year. How many people is that? It's enough to feel 46 fully loaded school buses, and indeed many of them were children.The mayor of Chicago, Lori Lightfoot doesn't like the police and she is responding to this crisis by demanding more police units outside of her home. Wait a second. She doesn't like police, but she wants more cops outside her home. Why is that? Because her safety is the only thing she cares about.She knows she presides over a city where people are getting killed, and she doesn't want to be one of them.Now, sources tell this show that her district Police Commander refused to move more cops into her neighborhood. He said that his officers are already stretched too thin protecting the citizens of Chicago. For this he was punished, he was promptly reassigned to another unit.We asked the Mayor's Office about this and they angrily denied it. They said the mayor had no role in the reassignment of the Police Commander. Of course, they didn't pledge to jump in and fix it. We'll let you decide whether they're telling the truth or not.Anthony Napolitano is an alderman in the City of Chicago and he joins us tonight. Alderman, thanks so much for coming on.ANTHONY NAPOLITANO, ALDERMAN, CHICAGO: Hi, Tucker. How are you?CARLSON: I'm well, but the idea that the Mayor of Chicago asked for police protection for herself when thousands have been shot in the city so far this year makes me dizzy, the hypocrisy of that.NAPOLITANO: Yes, you know, honestly, I can't attest to that situation in general. But what I can tell you talking to many police officers and many high ranking officers, there are a lot of these commanders, these captains, these lieutenants that are getting to the boiling point right now. They're just -- they feel so understaffed. They don't have enough men and women, police officers on the street, and when they're forced to reallocate police to different portions of the city that can't handle the crime going on right now, they are leaving their districts and their neighborhoods more vulnerable.It's getting to the point right now, like I said before, we're not able to keep up with the rate of attrition because these bosses are retiring. They feel like they're leaving their men and women out there in harm's way and it's a scary point right now for them.CARLSON: So if you look at the crime stats in the city, and they are overwhelming and tragic because each one represents a life ended, or certainly halted, you've got to kind of know -- no honest person could conclude that the police are responsible for 2,400 shootings this year. They're not. The cops didn't do that.What's the purpose of pulling back the police in the middle of a crime wave, honestly?NAPOLITANO: You know, if you actually look at the stats, I think shooting wise in the City of Chicago, police account for maybe 0.06 percent of the shooting.CARLSON: Exactly.NAPOLITANO: Compiled, actually our numbers in eight years is almost 23,000 people were shot. Pulling them back right now, I don't know. It just doesn't -- it doesn't make any sense. We can't -- we can't get enough police officers actually to even take this job right now because of the defund movement and the anti-police movement.But on top of it right now, officers don't -- they're not afraid to be the police, they want to be given the go ahead to be the police and have someone actually back them, someone get behind them and know that they're doing job the best to their ability and mistakes will happen, but you're going to back them on behalf of saving the city.Pulling resources is just -- I live in the 16th District, 32 square miles, sometimes we'll have three to four police officers patrolling the 16th District. That's absolutely ludicrous. We should have anywhere between 32 and 38 on the street in our district, but it's based on the reallocation of officers to other areas. It's forcing officers off this job.CARLSON: It's terrifying. You're one of 50 aldermen. I hope the other 49 listen to you and the mayor. Mr. Napolitano, thanks so much for coming on tonight. I appreciate it.NAPOLITANO: Thanks for having me, Tucker.CARLSON: Well, Major League Baseball started its season last week. That's the good news. The bad news is the coronavirus is already threatening to end it. Dr. Marc Siegel joins us after the break.Plus, we've talked to a New Jersey gym owner several times on the show. He defied the governor's orders. He said he was willing to face the consequences for that. This morning, he was arrested and handcuffed. He joins us after the break.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)CARLSON: The University of Notre Dame in Indiana announced today that it will no longer host a presidential debate this September. The University's President blamed the coronavirus quote, \"Health precautions would have greatly diminished the educational value of hosting the debate on our campus,\" end quote.Now it's possible that's the literal truth in the entire story. On the other hand, given that every major institution in American life opposes Donald Trump's reelection, maybe there's more to it.On the face of it, it does seem like an odd move. Schools usually fight to host debates. It's free advertising for them, Hofstra, Washington University in St. Louis, the chances are you've heard of those places because they hosted presidential debates.But Notre Dame says it doesn't want a debate because not enough students could attend it. Will other schools reach the same conclusion? If they do, could we wind up with an abbreviated number of presidential debates staged by remote on say Facebook or Zoom? Who knows? We don't know.We do know that would certainly help Joe Biden.Well, 11 players and two coaches of the Miami Marlins have tested positive for the coronavirus now. The outbreak comes less than a week after the league launched its short 60-game season. So what does this mean for the rest of the season?Fox News medical contributor, Dr. Marc Siegel joins us tonight with an answer to that question. Doctor, good to see you.DR. MARC SIEGEL, FOX NEWS CHANNEL MEDICAL CONTRIBUTOR: Tucker, in 1969 three things happened. You were born, a man landed on the moon and my miracle Mets won the World Series. And you know what? The American psyche, the national psyche, our spirit is tied into our national pastime baseball.All sports, all eyes are on Major League Baseball, and the problem tonight as you just said is several players on the Miami Marlins in a hotspot -- from a hotspot have tested positive.The problem is not with baseball itself, Tucker. Baseball is a sport that is socially distanced by definition. You're standing in the outfield. You're all alone. You're in the infield. You don't encounter anyone.The problem is that the way baseball is right now, everyone is playing in their home park. They're on the team buses. They're traveling together. They're eating at restaurants. They're sharing equipment. Equipment bags are being brought onto buses.Whereas the NBA and the NFL are doing bubble type techniques where they're playing in one place. NBA in Orlando, NHL -- National Hockey League in Edmonton and Toronto. Major League Baseball needs to survive this season to send a message to all sports. We need our sports. We need Major League Baseball.I want them to consider my prescription for Major League Baseball tonight, consider going to hubs. Consider going to cities and areas where there's not a lot of COVID-19 and not traveling as much and sticking together and not going around to as many restaurants and as many buses and as many planes.Let's restrict some of that and keep baseball going at all costs. Very important, Tucker.CARLSON: I think it is. All parts of this 250-year-old culture are important and that's certainly one of them. Dr. Siegel, thank you so much thanks.SIEGEL: Thanks, Tucker.CARLSON: So we've introduced you to the owners of the Atilus Gym in Bellmawr, New Jersey a couple of times on this show. This morning they were arrested. Why? For defying the state's mandatory shutdown orders. Those arrests come after a three-month standoff between the co-owner of the gym, Ian Smith and the governor of New Jersey, Phil Murphy, both of whom have been on the show.At one point, Smith removed the doors from the gym so the state couldn't keep them shut. Before reopening last May, he announced that he was willing to deal with the consequences of violating state law.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CARLSON: You're openly defying him on television. What do you think's going to happen to you when you do this?IAN SMITH, ATILUS GYM OWNER, BELLMAWR, NEW JERSEY: We're prepared for any and all consequences. Our actions on Monday are going to be grounded in the ideals of civil disobedience.(END VIDEO CLIP)CARLSON: He should have just set a Federal building on fire, screamed the right slogans, Ian Smith would be fine, but he didn't, and so he was arrested. He joins us tonight. Ian, good to see you. Tell us what happened.SMITH: Good evening, Tucker. So from the last time that we spoke, we had lost our newest case of contempt of court and that was on Friday of last week.The governor said that -- and requested in court to take extraordinary measures to stop us from operating a business and Judge Robert Lougy agreed with him. My partner and I had had the doors removed since Thursday and we had not left the building since. We had two weeks' worth of clothing and we were prepared to stay inside at all costs.But we did agree that we would go peacefully if law enforcement came. That time came this morning at about 5:10 this morning, when the County Sheriff walked in the building and said that we were under arrest.Frank and I at that point went peacefully, and when we arrived back after being booked, we had boarded up doors.CARLSON: I hoped the Sheriff was embarrassed. I assume, he was. There are murderers walking free, a lot of them in New Jersey tonight. Maybe they should do something real.You went on this show, you knew that that was wagging a finger in the face of the tyrants who run your state. You did it anyway. Why?SMITH: Because I'm not afraid of tyrants and no American should be, because we outnumber them greatly. And the only thing that they run off of is fear, which is why you see what you see in the media, where they're pumping fear into the coronavirus, when what they should be pumping is solutions.They don't do that. They don't ever offer any solutions. It's wear a mask, shut up and wait for a vaccine. That's not public health, and I won't subscribe to it.CARLSON: That's just the most moving thing I have heard in a long time, and I just want you to restate for our viewers who didn't see your last appearance on this show. How many infections of COVID-19 have been documented in your gym so far? Just to give our audience some sense of the public health threat that you pose.SMITH: At this point, we have record from June that we reopened and allowed visitors to our facility. We have over 13,000 visitors who have come to Atilus Gym in Bellmawr, and not a single case so far.Governor Murphy cannot say that about the long term care facilities that are 100 percent in his control that have been shut down since March and account for over 50 percent of the deaths in the state.CARLSON: Yes, so you pose a documented -- this is not speculation. The health authorities say you pose no threat at all, not one infection and you were handcuffed and arrested because you defied Governor Murphy.You're a brave man, Ian, and I'm grateful that you've come on the show and I hope you will keep us posted as to what happens next.SMITH: Just one more thing to end the night, Tucker, if I could. Governor Murphy asked us for 14 days to shut down -- 14 days today in New Jersey. It is day 132 of the shutdown. And I would just like everybody to think about that long and hard before they support his policies.CARLSON: Yes, once they get power, they never relinquish it. So as you know. Great to see you tonight. Thank you.SMITH: Good night, Tucker.CARLSON: Good night. So, here is the least controversial fact in social science. Children who are raised by two married parents perform much better in school, earn more as adults, much more likely to graduate, much less likely to become addicted to drugs or alcohol, far less likely to go to jail and are healthier.There are many benefits to growing up, in fact, in an intact nuclear family, but two parent households in this country are in steep decline.An update on the state of the American family is next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)CARLSON: One of the most outspokenly conservative professors in the United States died last week, there are not many. Mike Adams taught at the University of North Carolina, Wilmington. He was direct about his views. Adams opposed censorship and thought abortion was wrong.He believed in facts. He believed in historical record. Here's a clip of Adams describing what he thought of campus speech codes.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MIKE ADAMS, PROFESSOR, UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA, WILMINGTON: They consider this to be a political weapon for them to shut down speech that they can't rebut.I've got a definition by the way for hate speech, I think it's speech that the hate -- that the left hates because they lack the intelligence to rebut it.(END VIDEO CLIP)CARLSON: It is one thing for a talk show host to say that, but you can imagine the response when a Professor says it. For articulating his beliefs, Adams faced never ending harassment.After he criticized the tyrannical behavior of the Governor of North Carolina during the coronavirus shutdowns, thousands petitioned for his removal. And in the end, the mob won. The University of North Carolina, Wilmington forced Adams into early retirement. His last day would have been next week.Well, last week, Adams apparently shot himself. But it wasn't enough. The media continued to attack him. NBC News ran a piece entitled, \"Professor behind vile racist and sexist tweets found dead in north carolina home.\" That's real. BuzzFeed ran a story with this headline, quote, \"A Professor who was known for his racist, misogynistic tweets was found dead in his home.\"Imagine doing something like that, writing something like that about a dead man. They didn't think twice. That's who they are. That's what they'd do to you.Well, there's been a lot of research, longitudinal serious research over the decades, and it's very clear, it couldn't be clearer. Children raised by married parents vastly outperform children who weren't on every scale, on average. They're happier, healthier, more successful. They're paid more. They're not in jail. They graduate.So we should be very concerned about a new Senate report. It shows the demise of two parent households has accelerated dramatically in this country. One notable collapse is the percentage of young women who are married, that's dropped from 71 percent in 1962 to 42 percent in 2019.The result of this, people aren't getting married, but they're still having children. That means a massive uptick and out of wedlock births. Out of wedlock births rose from five percent of all births in 1960 to 40 percent of all births today.Heather Mac Donald is the author of \"The Diversity Delusion.\" She's studied these trends carefully, and we're happy to have her on the show tonight. So Heather, the first thing I noticed, and I think it's -- the science of this is so clear, I don't think there's even a debate about it.But I noticed that in affluent neighborhoods like the one I've spent a lot of my life living in, not one person will judge out of wedlock births, but there are no out of wedlock births. Everyone is married and has kids within marriage. What does that tell you?HEATHER MAC DONALD, MANHATTAN INSTITUTE: It tells you that the elites have lost faith in the bourgeois values that they practice, but they're not willing to articulate because they believe that somehow they're associated with white supremacy.We've been hearing a lot, Tucker, about this white privilege meme. That's a poisonous fiction. Here's the real class divide in this country, and sadly, it's also a race divide, the likelihood of growing up with two married parents.I'm going to break a massive feminist taboo here and say that males matter. That fathers matter. That fathers bring a set of values and norms to child rearing, whether it's self-reliance or self-discipline, honor and courage. On average, that complement what mothers can bring.CARLSON: Of course.MAC DONALD: And when you lose that symmetry, and that emotional support for children, that goes so far beyond economic support, which is largely irrelevant, it's the fact that you have twice as much kinship support and people that two parents can spell each other when one is exhausted. That's what results in successful children.And the anarchy that we've lived through with the looting and the rioting of the last month, Tucker, has been preceded by a more slow motion anarchy and breakdown, which is the breakdown of the family because our prisons today are filled almost exclusively with fatherless men.CARLSON: I can't think of any national politician who would say that. I mean, Barack Obama talked about fathers. I don't think he ever once mentioned marriage because unmarried mothers are a core constituency in his party, other than maybe I'm serious, Kanye West. I can't think of anybody who has ever said anything like that. Why?MAC DONALD: The feminists rule our discourse. You're not allowed to say that men matter. I mean, belief survivors believe that they live in a rape culture. I will say though, that before he was elected President, Barack Obama in 2008, gave a Father's Day speech from Chicago that I urge all your listeners, but I urge in particular, the so-called progressives to read, where he gave the facts that you started with, Tucker, about the much greater chance that fatherless boys ended up in prison, end up out of school, end up in gangs.Sadly, Obama did not act on that speech, and the Republicans have not been much better. Part of the problem is, is that so many of them, if they were married initially, are now divorced. So it's a hard thing to turn this around. But we have to because the breakdown of the family is the biggest civilizational catastrophe that we're facing today that is the root of the spiraling crime, insane drive-by shootings that we see in the inner city and the destruction of human potential.CARLSON: I couldn't agree more. The science is completely clear. And by the way, just because you're divorced doesn't disqualify you from telling the truth. If you drink too much, it doesn't mean you want your kids to be alcoholics.I mean, this -- the whole personalist political identity is everything is one of the dumbest ideas we've ever internalized that we have internalized.MAC DONALD: Yes.CARLSON: Heather Mac Donald, really one of our smartest guests ever. Great to see you. Thank you.MAC DONALD: Thanks, Tucker.CARLSON: So Greg Gutfeld, in addition to being a TV star has thought deeply about so-called cancel culture and how to defeat it. It's possible he just wrote a whole book about it. He's here to tell us what he's concluded, next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)CARLSON: So if you're Antifa, you can burn down a Federal building or storm a police station; but if you're you, the rules are different. Say one wrong thing and you're done. That's called cancel culture. Can we stop it?Fox's Greg Gutfeld has thought a lot about this. He has written a new book, \"The Plus: Self-Help for People Who Hate Self-Help.\" It comes out tomorrow. We're happy to have the great Greg Gutfeld on our show tonight.Greg, congrats on the book. What can we do ...GREG GUTFELD, FOX NEWS HOST: Thank you.CARLSON: ... to end -- to cancel, cancel culture?GUTFELD: Well, first I have to say that amazing gym owner was amazing.CARLSON: Amazing.GUTFELD: That beard. I could live in that beard. I could live like a little elf inside a little Keebler hole in his beard.Okay, I had to get that out of the way. Here's the deal with cancel culture.CARLSON: I don't want to think about that.GUTFELD: Yes, you should. Here's the thing about cancel culture. This is the first work around for the First Amendment in history. Because whenever you complain about cancel culture, they will say, you have the First Amendment, freedom of speech. We're just going to ruin your career and take your livelihood and drive you to suicide. So it actually makes the First Amendment meaningless.There's no way First Amendment can help you.CARLSON: Exactly.GUTFELD: So identified the problems, right? Cancel culture defines you at your worst. The past is always present. Something you did a long time ago doesn't matter. If you apologize, that's merely an appetizer, and the media becomes the amplifier for these deeds simply for clicks.So the solution which I have in my book, you need to make cancel culture costly, because right now it's too cheap to pull it off.CARLSON: Yes.GUTFELD: The low barrier for entry to join a mob is nil. So, the solution is to make it expensive and the key is to share the risk. If we stick together, and it's really easy. The price becomes too high for the mob. The only reason why they exist is because we don't stick together.We get scared. We hide. Companies will virtue signal rather than protect their employees. We often need to build in mutually assured destruction.The assumption that cancel culture could rebound on them destroys it. Remember that reporter that canceled the kid who donated all that money to the Children's Hospital? They found like an old tweet. Then like a week later, they found tweets of the reporter. He lost his job. It has to be like that.CARLSON: So you have to use -- I'm not sure I'm for that. I mean, there's no way to not use their tactics and beat them. It's just a disgusting one.GUTFELD: You could be nice.CARLSON: Yes.GUTFELD: It really is. I think there's a good positive part about this in terms of being \"The Plus.\" You should define people by their best intentions. You should everyday ask yourself if you are contributing to mob culture, especially on social media.Sometimes I'm guilty of it, especially if I drink a little wine. So I try to stay off. We tend to look at Twitter as an ex. We're trying to impress them, rather than looking at it as a harmful, unknown quality.The reason why Tucker Carlson is the happiest talk show host on Earth, is because he never sets foot on social media. I'm not even sure he knows how to turn on a computer. That's why he doesn't care.And one of the solutions to cancel culture is not giving a damn. The problem is, the culture can still care about you. You can't just turn off the weather. They can follow you everywhere.But I think that you have to share the risk, and everyday ask yourself, is there a way to help people who are in trouble?CARLSON: I think that's really wise advice and on your way out, I just -- this is for you, Greg Gutfeld. We have a picture of the beard.GUTFELD: Yes.CARLSON: You'd like to live inside. The rotted oak tree you'd like to tote your acorns to.GUTFELD: Do you know how cozy that would be?CARLSON: I can't believe it.GUTFELD: I'm all for cozy.CARLSON: I think we indulged that.GUTFELD: I am all for cozy.CARLSON: Unbelievable. Congrats on the book.GUTFELD: You endorsed it.CARLSON: I sort of.GUTFELD: Thank you, buddy.CARLSON: Great to see you. Well, there's been a lot happening in this country, international pandemics, trade wars, domestic upheaval have rocked this country in a way it hasn't been in a long time.Who is benefiting? China is benefiting? We will talk to someone who has thought a lot about how they're benefiting, next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)CARLSON: There is evidence including from Chinese scientists, the coronavirus began in a Chinese lab. The Chinese government certainly lied about its spread, then engaged in sketchy trade practices that destroyed millions of American manufacturing jobs.Fentanyl floods in from China. Hundreds of thousands of Americans have died from that.So China has caused havoc, are they benefiting from it? That's the question for Bill Hagerty. He is running for Senate in Tennessee. He's in the middle of a tough primary. This segment has nothing to do with that.We've asked to talk to Mr. Hagerty because it was knowledge of Asia. He served as the U.S. Ambassador to Japan and we're happy to have him on tonight. Mr. Hagerty, thanks so much for coming on.So the concern would be that after all the problems we've dealt with, thanks to China, they are taking advantage of our weakness to increase their advantage. Do you think that's happening?BILL HAGERTY (R), FORMER U.S. AMBASSADOR TO JAPAN: Absolutely, Tucker. I know that that's the case. That's one of the key reasons that President Trump has endorsed me for the United States Senate. He knows that he needs an ally that understands the scene in China up close and personal. I've dealt with them. We've got to deal with China strictly and toughly.CARLSON: The fentanyl question is one that baffles me. So hundreds of thousands of Americans have died from ODs, far more than have died from COVID-19.HAGERTY: Indeed.CARLSON: That's chemicals coming from China primarily. Nobody ever says that. Why?HAGERTY: We should be saying it. President Trump negotiated in Buenos Aires to stop this with the Chinese Premier. They haven't. Again, we need to stand up strong to deal with this.They're killing Americans. They're sending the material over to Mexico. It's coming across a very porous border. We've got to stand with President Trump to seal the border to secure it to stop the lawlessness and in this drug trade.CARLSON: Does it seem like tensions between the U.S. and China are escalating to a new level? There are signs, consulates closing, et cetera, that they are.HAGERTY: Yes.CARLSON: Are they?HAGERTY: Indeed, indeed, Tucker and as U.S. Ambassador, to Japan, I've seen it up close. They've advanced on us militarily. The minute we step back in the South China Sea, they advanced their forces. That's why President Trump has sent two aircraft carrier groups out that direction.We've got to stand up to them militarily. Diplomatically, you've seen what they've done. They overtook the World Health Organization. I applaud President Trump for taking us out of that group.And economically, they've been a predator for years. We've seen Presidents both Democrat and Republican look the other way as they continued to mount their aggression.They've taken our jobs. They've destroyed our economy with this pandemic, and they've killed over 150,000 Americans. They need to be held to account and I look forward to serving to help do that.CARLSON: Bill Hagerty, I appreciate it. Thanks for coming on tonight. Former U.S. ambassador to Japan.HAGERTY: Thank you so much, Tucker. Great to be with you.CARLSON: Thank you very much. So many things going on right now that it's almost impossible to keep track of all of them.We spend an inordinate amount of time we think it is worth it, but covering the chaos in our streets, but that doesn't mean there isn't a lot happening behind it.And so we're going to make every effort this week and going forward not to let stories fall through the cracks that really matter.In the meantime, we'll be back tomorrow night at eight. The show that is the sworn enemy of lying, pomposity, smugness and groupthink. We mean it.Have a great night with the ones you love.Now, it is time for Sean Hannity from New York.", "comment": "", "topic": "TRANSCRIPT", "date": " July 27"}, {"cover": "https://a57.foxnews.com/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/694940094001/01647f68-5988-47c2-bd0e-40ee0943dc16/b64d3115-ec55-40eb-83a3-eb015b46db80/1280x720/match/156/88/image.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "title": "Geraldo Rivera slams Joe Biden's claim that Trump is first 'racist' president", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/transcript/geraldo-rivera-slams-joe-bidens-claim-that-trump-is-first-racist-president", "subtitle": "Guests: Leo Terrell, Ami Horowitz, Bernie Kerik, Matt Gaetz, John Kennedy Geraldo Rivera, Dan Bongino, Karl Rove", "keyword": "U.S.-China trade war and protectionism", "website": "Fox News", "author": "", "content": "SEAN HANNITY, HOST: Welcome to \"Hannity.\"Buckle up. We have a big announcement coming tonight.And, by the way, we also want you to call all your Democratic friends right now, ask them to learn the real, ugly truth about Joe Biden. Joe Biden hit a new low today and also confusing moments again. We will expose the entire truth that the mob will never tell you.Joe, it's time we give America a history lesson about you. That's coming tonight.But first, we start with the carnage in Chicago, chaos in Portland, violent crime surging in nearly every major city in America. Democratic mayors, Democratic governors, they have failed in their most basic duty, and that is the most basic responsibility, to maintain law and order. They have failed and people are dying and being shot as a result.They have failed to keep their neighborhood safe. They have failed to prevent violent crime. As a result, men, women and children are dying. Our fellow Americans are dying.These mayors are literally twiddling their thumbs and playing politics. Philadelphia's top prosecutor is now vowing to arrest any federal law enforcement agents that are sent to the city.But President Trump is taking action. Today in a major press conference, he announced the expansion of what's called Operation LeGend. That's a federal program. It started in Kansas City and was named after a 4-year-old boy who was killed by gunfire while asleep in his own bed.Well, they'll now send more than 100 federal officers to Chicago, 35 to Albuquerque without having a problem in order to help take violent criminals off of the streets. The mayors aren't doing it. The governors aren't doing it.Listen to the president.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: The citizens of Chicago are citizens of America and they have the same right as every other American to live in safety, dignity and peace. No mother should ever have to cradle her dead child in her arms simply because politicians refused to do what is necessary to secure their neighborhood and to secure their city.Every American, no matter their income, race, or their zip code, should be able to walk the city streets free from violence and free from fear.For this reason today, I am announcing the Department of Justice will immediately surge federal law enforcement to the city of Chicago. The FBI, ATF, DEA, U.S. Marshals Service and Homeland Security will together be sending hundreds of skilled law enforcement officers to Chicago to help drive down violent crime.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: Safety, security is the foundation for our great American dream. Every child, every neighborhood, every city deserves to be safe. You can't climb the ladder of opportunity without security and safety.This president committed to making serious progress all over the country.Let's go back to his conference earlier today.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: My vision for America's cities could not be more different from the lawlessness being pushed by the extreme radical left. While others want to defund, defame, and abolish the police, I want to support and honor our great police.We want to build factories in Baltimore, not Beijing. We want to make our products in Chicago, not Shanghai. We want the American dream for American children, and I will fight to deliver that dream every ounce -- every single ounce of my strength, I will be fighting.But opportunity cannot thrive where there's violence, prosperity cannot flourish where there's bloodshed, and security cannot exist where there are violent criminals who are able to maim and murder with impunity. That is what Operation Legend is all about.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: \"Operation Legend\" is a beginning. It's greatly needed in all of these cities.Now, 100 agents, they cannot save and protect these cities. They can't. They can protect, well, federal property, they can help in investigations, they can get to underlying groups that are fomenting this violence.But unless and until these reckless, irresponsible Democratic mayors and governors do their job and/or allow the help they are being offered, they are allowing innocent people to die. That is all on them. New York, Chicago, Philly, Baltimore, you name the city, Seattle, Portland, it's all on them.Especially true in Chicago. Shootings were up 47 percent over last year, homicides up by a whopping 51 percent, 70 shot last weekend, 63 the weekend before, even children dying every single week. The violence reaches catastrophic levels.By the way, last night, we reported on that horrific mass shooting in the south side of Chicago. Fifteen people seriously wounded outside of a funeral home in what appears to be a gun-related incident. At least 60 shell casings recovered from the scene, caught on camera by nearby surveillance system.Take a look.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)(GUNSHOTS)(SCREAMING)(GUNSHOTS)(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: Mayor Lightweight isn't doing anything to protect her city.Moments later, two visibly shaken witnesses compared it to a war zone, as the president has been calling this and applauded the president's plan, please help us. Please send in.Well, the mayor and the governor won't let him do that. Take a look.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We wish it would stop. And we're glad the federal troops are here in Chicago because the violence is literally just as bad as it was as the Pandora, the Pandoran (INAUDIBLE). So, I mean, we need more cops and federal troops, because there's literally like we're in Iraq or something.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes, it feels like, we're -- at a war, in a war.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: As this devastating scene unfolding, sadly, typical night, Chicago's Mayor Lori Lightfoot who is a lightweight in terms of protecting people, busy on Twitter. What was she doing? Bashing President Trump, tweeting: Under no circumstances will I allow Donald Trump's troops to come to Chicago and terrorize our residents.She clearly hates the president more than she cares about innocent men, women and children in her city. Rahm \"Dead Fish\" Emanuel, he didn't do anything either. Barack Obama's president, barely mentioned Chicago, 1,000 shot, 1,000 died. Biden did nothing.At that point, when will these liberal mayors and governors, when do we hold them accountable for not protecting innocent people? Hundreds of people shot every week in Chicago and a lot of the cities. Six small children have been killed in July alone.Last night, a 3-year-old little girl was shot in the head, but the mayor is worried about troops terrorizing her city. Really? Now, what has she done to stop the violence? What has she done to save lives?Lightfoot who is a lightweight on protecting citizens seems more worried about optics and politics than the men, women and children that she is supposed to protect and serve. It's a national disgrace.She is not the only Democrat putting politics before human life. In Portland, we see the same thing. Democrats there, they're apoplectic. The federal agents were trying to protect federal buildings from being burned to the ground. That is their right and their job.Portland's mayor calling the federal officers, literally, the officers, not the anarchist, not the people involved in the violence, calling the officers un-American.Oregon's stupid governor floating an insane conspiracy theory that they were abducting people.Pelosi, get this, comparing agents, law enforcement agents who put their lives on the line to protect and serve \"stormtroopers\".Congressman Clyburn, the leadership in the Democratic Party, referring to them as Nazi Gestapo.Meanwhile, corrupt and confused Joe Biden, he's not said a single positive word about law enforcement, the 99th percent, since running for president. He accused federal agents of, quote, brutally attacking peaceful protesters.Now, we have also heard him say that police have become the enemy and he supports the defund effort or as he calls it, we will reallocate sources. He likes that word better.Let's be clear -- anarchist, vandals, have been writing nearly two straight months in downtown Portland. They firebombed the federal courthouse twice. They possibly, permanently blinded federal officers with lasers. Dozens of buildings have been vandalized, lit ablaze.Businesses, they're shutdown. People don't feel safe. These are not peaceful protests, Joe.And here's just a small example of what law enforcement is facing. Take a look.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)(CHANTING)(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: Wait until you see all of the video with Ami Horowitz who's on the ground in Portland as we speak. There have been more than 50 straight days of violent demonstrations in the city's downtown district.Remember, according to Biden, federal law enforcement officials were the real enemy here. See what's happening? Biden doesn't have a plan to stop violence, make America cities safer to protect innocent people so he just trashes Donald Trump.Now, he's even deploying one of the old Democratic Party favorite tactics. He is now playing the race card. I pointed out and I've done this history so many times come, every two years, every four years, like clockwork. Republicans, they are racist, sexists, misogynistic, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamophobic, they want dirty air and water. They want grandma and grandpa to eat dog food, cat food, before Paul Ryan or a Republican Trump look-alike throws granny over a cliff in a wheelchair.And, today, Biden accusing Trump, the president, of being the first racist president in history. Get ready for \"Hannity\" history real lesson in a second.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOE BIDEN, D-PRESUMPTIVE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: You have racists, they've existed and they tried to get elected president. He's the first one that has. And the way he pits people against one another is all designed to divide the country.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: Put y'all back in chains.All right. Now, it's time for a \"Hannity\" history lesson. Forget the fact that Democrats have accused every Republican of being racist. We've gone over -- 1998 radio ad in Missouri, the 2000 James Byrd ad, Al Gore, Republicans don't even want to count you in the census. They will put y'all back in chains.Let's go over the facts. Here's Joe Biden's history.It was Donald Trump, not Joe and not Barack who passed criminal justice reform and prison reform. It was Donald Trump, it wasn't Joe and it was not Barack who signed off on police reform. It was Donald Trump also doing opportunity zones, targeting mostly minority neighborhoods to help -- well, build the economies in neighborhoods that have been left behind by Joe and Barack.It was President Trump, not Joe, not Barack, who ushered in record low after record low after record low unemployment for African-Americans, Hispanic-Americans, Asian-Americans, women in the workplace, youth unemployment, African-American youth unemployment. Joe and Barack, they didn't do any of that.As a matter of fact, 13 million more Americans in food stamps, 8 million more in poverty, lowest labor participation rate in, oh, since the \u201870s. Had a 51-year low in homeownership rate, and the worst recovery since the '40s. That's their eight years of failure.And, by the way, three years in, President Trump has done more for minorities in this country than Joe Biden, Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer did in 125 years.Watch this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: You look at employment, you look at opportunity zones and maybe most importantly, you look at criminal justice reform. You look at prison reform. I've done things that nobody else -- and I've said this and I say it openly, and not a lot of people dispute it, I've done more for black Americans than anybody with the possible exception of Abraham Lincoln. Nobody has even been close.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: The media mob, the biggest contributor to the Biden campaign and all things radical, extreme Democratic socialist, they'll never tell you that.So, you need to ask yourself the question, what was Biden doing during his 50-plus year career in the swamp for African-Americans, other minorities?Here is where it gets interesting. All -- tell all your Democratic friends, we know he was very close and spoke so highly of the former Klansman Robert KKK Byrd, yes, former Klan leader. Biden called the Byrd the dean of the U.S. Senate, a close friend of mine and a mentor. That man filibustered the Civil Rights Act of 1964, that, well, Lyndon Johnson needed 80 percent of Republicans in the House and Senate to get past and most Democrats are opposing it.During a speech, Joe Biden in 1973 praised Democrats in a two-party system in the South that is called, well I'm a good for the -- I won't use the word.Around the same time, Biden was actively working with the segregationists. He didn't want immigration. He opposed school busing. According to NBC News, he led the charge on an initiative to keep black students away from the black students away from white students. That is his record.In \u201877, Biden worried his children, his children, if integration -- would grow up in a, quote, racial jungle if integration is not done in an orderly way, whatever the hell that means.1993, referred to inner-city youth as predators on our streets as he coauthored the most aggressive crime bill that ramped up prison sentences for dozens of crimes specifically targeting in the end minority Americans.In 2006, telling a crowd, well, you have to have a slight Indian accent to work out at 7-Eleven or Dunkin Donuts. I'm not kidding he said.2006, he bragged his state was a slave state.2007, yes, he actually said this about Barack Obama: the first, OK, the first mainstream African-American who is articulate, bright, clean, that story book, man. Wow.Last year, he said, poor kids could be just as bright as white kids. And recently, you ain't black if you don't support Donald Trump. Joe decides that?Joe Biden shouldn't throw stones from that glass house. That mob in the media will never tell you. Better yet, he could just stop saying racist things altogether. Joe, take a look in the mirror.When is anybody in the mob and the media going to ask him about any of these things? Because that's the truth, that's the history. And, by the way, actually knows if Joe Biden can even form a answer to any of these questions.We're going to play his very latest struggles in a moment. It's not good.Joining us now with reaction, FOX News contributor Dan Bongino, Fox News correspondent-at-large, Geraldo Rivera, civil rights attorney, Leo Terrell, Leo 2.0.All right, Leo, let's play a game here except it's not a game because lives matter, right? Let's not play games.LEO TERRELL, CIVIL RIGHTS LAWYER: Yes.HANNITY: Donald Trump set record low after record low unemployment, opportunity zones, the largest and most expensive of long-term commitment to historically black colleges in America -- Joe didn't do that. Criminal justice reform, Joe and Barack didn't do that. Police reform, Joe and Barack didn't do that.So, you tell me, if Donald Trump said the things I just laid out that Biden said, how would African-Americans and how would the media treat Donald Trump?TERRELL: They -- they would simply annihilate him. Let me be very clear to every Democrat on the planet, Donnell J. Trump has done more for black America in three years than the Biden/Obama administration.The reason why I'm here right now, the reason I'm voting for Donald Trump is because Joe Biden went on national radio and said, if you're -- if you vote for Trump, you ain't black. That is insulting. That is racist! Biden is the racist.And what is amazing is, you think you have another dinosaur, Jim Clyburn, who uses terms like Nazis, and Gestapo, he needs to retire. That is insulting to the people who suffer during the holocaust. So you have these old outdated Democrats who are still trying to pander to blacks. Blacks reject this. And with the crime going on in these Democratic cities, it is insulting.Donald Trump is the only person who can resurrect these Democratic cities and save them from lawlessness.But let's be very clear: Joe Biden is a racist, not Donald Trump.HANNITY: OK, Geraldo Rivera, I know how you feel about underprivileged in America, kids of all races. You got a heart of gold. One thing I will say about Geraldo, Dan Bongino knows it, Leo knows it, I know it, heart of gold.Donald Trump said those things, Geraldo, how different would it be in the media today?GERALDO RIVERA, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT-AT-LARGE: Oh, please, they would blow him up. It would be impossible for him to continue it. He's not a racist. I've known him 45 years.Having said that, I don't like that kung flu thing. I wish he would stop that. I think he has.I think there is some sloppy stuff, you know, in recent years that I don't like, but I know him. I know I've been in and out of that Trump Tower 50 times. It is as integrated as any building in this country. He gives opportunity on the basis of competence. Not skin color.And for Biden to say he is the first racist ever elected, that shows how disconnected Joe Biden is. 12 United States presidents were slaveholders. Joe should do a little research before he makes flamboyant charge like that, so unhinged from reality. Nixon, LBJ used language far more salty and you would argue, in today's standards, racist.This man is a good-hearted man and I really do believe that in terms of the economic opportunity zones and the criminal justice reform, he really has done more than any recent president for integration and the advancement of everybody regardless of their race, color, religion. You know that, Sean.HANNITY: And, Dan, this is what it comes down to too -- slogans, bumper stickers, symbolism. I'll take the substance. I'll take the jobs. I'll take the opportunity zones. I will take the money for historically black colleges.I'll take the results over the rhetoric. Every two years, every four years, Dan Bongino, Republicans are racist, sexist, my whole list.BONGINO: Yeah. Yeah, you want a talker or you want a doer? You want a guy who built stuff, you want a guy who talks about building stuff.You know, Sean, the greatest political scam in the last 50 years has been the media perpetrating the myth and falsehood that the Democrat Party is on the side of the minority community. This is ridiculous.Do you know how many people, by the way, through op-ed columns and elsewhere were whispering in the president's ear? Man, you know, leave Chicago alone. Leave it alone. Let them suffer the ramifications of their own bad decision-making with the leaders.You know how easy of a decision that could have been for him? And he didn't. And I was proud of him today, Sean. He came in there and said, no, not on my watch.And, you know, as I was preparing for the segment earlier, Sean, it's not a joke. I wanted to follow-up on a 3-year-old girl who was shot in the face in Chicago. So, I Googled it. It's on my phone.And it's right there. It turns out you have to go through which 3-year-old girl? Because there's not just one.Sean, if this was happening in Darfur, we'd have the embassy working 24 hours a day, 3-year-olds being shot in the face, I'm not kidding, Google 3- year-old shot in Chicago and you have to find the right one.HANNITY: Unbelievable.BONGINO: Thank God president Trump has the cojones to go in there and do the right thing and say not on my watch.HANNITY: Protecting federal buildings and 100 federal officers unless the governors and mayors do their job or at least request the help needed. The president -- he can't take responsibility for their failures.Last word --TERRELL: You know, one other comment, one other comment. The president wants to do more for America and people of color. Tim Scott, justice reform bill, guess what, two black Democrats, Booker and Harris stopped it. The Democrats are blocking justice in this country because they don't want Trump to succeed. It's crazy.HANNITY: Last word quick, Geraldo.RIVERA: But I don't understand, Sean, why there aren't more arrests in Portland. Those federal officers are taking abuse that is criminal. It is literally felonious assault.When you shine a laser in the eyes of a cop and his eyes are permanently damaged as a result, that's an assault, a felonious assault. These people should be arrested.And Mayor Wheeler and those other local hacks be damned. It's time for the feds to -- if a crime is committed in front of them, grab those people in charge them with arson. Charge them with whatever the crime is. They were being caught on tape. We're watching it every night.What is it now, almost 60 days? It's preposterous!HANNITY: Well, speaking of which, thank you all as always.Now, speaking of the war zone in Portland, Ami Horowitz was in the middle of that shift, the Adam Schiff show, horrible chaos, horrible violence. He was put in danger. We've got that exclusive video coming up next. A hundred and four days out of an election, Karl Rove, Senator John Kennedy, and a really big announcement.Stay with us.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)HANNITY: All right. The chaos continues in Portland.Last night, filmmaker, documentarian Ami Horowitz was in the city, captured these disturbing videos. Take a look.(VIDEO CLIP PLAYS)HANNITY: More on the collapse of another liberal city, law and order gone. Well, he's in Portland tonight, filmmaker Ami Horowitz.Describe what you saw last night especially as it relates to what they were doing to the police and to other areas?AMI HOROWITZ, FILMMAKER: Yeah, total chaos, Sean. Basically what is going on is you have in Portland at 9:00, you have a four square block radius around the federal court building in Portland that is taken over by protesters. Last night when I was there, going back tonight, there was about 5,000 people there who are protesting.But I've got to -- we've got to be clear what I mean by protesters. One of the -- the great stories about what is going on, not just in Portland but about the protest in general is the malpractice how these people are portrayed, how people view them in the media. They're saying it's all kumbaya, brother. They are just sitting there having a great time, and they're cooking out, and they've got people singing and dancing.And the reality is, you have hundreds of people attacked this federal building. I mean attacked. I mean, they had hammers, and steel pipes and were setting fires to burn the building down, and all the old people in it. While the, quote-unquote, peaceful protesters are exhorting them off, cheering them on, OK?These people are aghast to what was happening. These were not people who were saying, hey, guys, you shouldn't be doing this. They were supporting these people who are trying to burn these officers alive in the federal building.So, to say that they're -- it's emotionally peaceful protest, it's -- it's a load of crap. It's not true at all. They are part of the problem and a part of the violence.HANNITY: And you're going to go out again tonight. We'll have more video tomorrow, I assume. I hope I'm wrong. I hope there is no more video tomorrow, but I guess that's impossible.All right. Ami Horowitz, thank you.Today, comrade Bill de Blasio continued his denial New York City is experiencing extremely dangerous crime wave on his watch. He is threatening to sue President Trump. OK, if he sends in the feds. Philadelphia has been talked that they'll arrest troops. Meaning people there to protect the city and protect federal property. Wow, this is how sick it's gotten.Take a look.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MAYOR BILL DE BLASIO, D-N.Y.: I want to be very, very clear that we will not allow this to happen in our city. And this could only make things worse and I have sent this letter today to the attorney general and to the acting homeland secure -- homeland security secretary, making clear, formally, that the presence of these federal officials, these federal officers is not welcome here in New York City and is not needed here.We will not be intimidated. And if we see these federal officers on our streets, then we will see the Trump administration in court.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: Ooh, so scary.That guy right there, he is the dumbest mayor in the country. Even New York Governor Cuomo admitted Trump's concerns, the president's concerns about crime in our nation's capital and New York City, the largest city in the country, are well-founded. Take a look.(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)GOV. ANDREW CUOMO, D-N.Y.: Look, the president's concerns about New York City where well-founded. There are issues in New York City. You put COVID on top of the unrest after the George Floyd murder, et cetera, there's been an increase in crime. So I get the concerns, but I don't believe federal troops are the answer.(END AUDIO CLIP)HANNITY: He's not doing anything either. Philadelphia's top prosecutor saying that he's going to arrest any federal law enforcement agents sent to the city.Joining us now, author of the upcoming book \"Firebrand\", Congressman Matt Gaetz, former NYPD commissioner Bernie Kerik.Bernie, we know how to save cities. You did it, you and Rudy Giuliani. You went from about 2,500 murders a year, it got down as low as 300.BERNARD KERIK, FORMER NYPD COMMISSIONER: Sean, listen, Mayor -- Mayor Bill de Blasio is an idiot. And the reason I say he's an idiot is because we already have federal agents combined with the NYPD in every capacity. We have the FBI Joint Terrorist Task Force. We have the DEA task force. We have a number of bank robbery federal task force. They're already here.Here's the issue: the president has to up the numbers. That's what he has to do. There is already agreements in place between the NYPD and the federal government for these agents to be here. If he ups those numbers and we focus on gangs, guns and drugs, we can annihilate the rule of thugs.So, I know the mayor wants to talk about troops, we're not talking about troops. We're talking about special agents from the FBI, the DEA, ATF, and other federal agents that are already here. They already work here.I was in the DEA task force. He has no idea what he's talking about.HANNITY: You know, Matt Gaetz, you see this unfolding around the country. My attitude is very simple.Now, Bernie Kerik is right. We do have federal agents in big cities. OK, protecting federal courthouses and federal buildings. They have not only a right, an obligation to do so.But unless and until these liberal mayors, liberal governors are willing to do their job, and are rejecting the president's help, this is on them. That's their problem. All the president can do is offer to help.And I will tell you, the rejection is resulting in lost of life. This is not a game anymore.REP. MATT GAETZ, R-FLA.: America is a great nation and a great nation does not allow her cities to fall victim to the angry mob. The victims in these cases of violence, who see their businesses destroyed, their churches burned, sometimes even their lives lost and the lives lost of their children. They're not just Seattleites or Portlanders, or New Yorkers, they're Americans.And you're right. Secretary Chad Wolf said that if we didn't have federal troops there, the federal courthouses, the federal buildings would literally fall. And so, President Trump doesn't just have a legal obligation, he has a moral obligation to act.And our nation is stronger than this mob. I'm glad that President Trump is going to prove it. And these municipal leaders who have been feckless and cowardly, they will be exposed for what they are.HANNITY: By the way, Matt Gaetz can announce he's going to run for president in 2028. I just -- I've been hearing rumors all day about that. I'm teasing.You know, Bernie Kerik, the thing is that if they're going to turn federal agents into the enemy, and their attitude is get out of town, clean up the graffiti before you go, I don't think the president ought to take that step because at that point, now he is not only fighting the anarchist who will be encouraged by these reckless, irresponsible failed mayors and governors.KERIK: You know what, Sean? There was something really bothering me, this starts in Portland. You know, that mayor and the governor of Oregon, they're talking about all that stuff about, you shouldn't be there, the troop shouldn't be there, they shouldn't be, you know, harassing the protesters so to speak.I honestly think the FBI should be looking at these people. You cannot tell me that they're intentionally, they're not intentionally forcing the police not to go out and take out these protesters that are trying to burn down federal courthouses.HANNITY: Do you want to make your announcement tonight, Matt Gaetz?GAETZ: The only announcement I have is I've got a book \"Firebrand\" available for preorder on Amazon. And you know what? Joe Biden --HANNITY: I'm now endorsing it.GAETZ: -- he doesn't give a damn about these cities. If he did, he'd have done something about it when he was vice president.HANNITY: Yes. By the way, congratulations.One day, I want to tell a story about Matt, about what a great human being he is and how he's literally changed somebody's life for the better in a dramatic way. But I'm not going to do that story tonight.GAETZ: Thank you, Sean.HANNITY: All right. I mean it.All right. Quick break, Joe Biden, more blunders. I mean, it's a disaster. They're actually stopping interviews because he can't continue. We'll play you the tape. The architect Karl Rove joins us.Also, Senator John Kennedy here and our big announcement, all coming up. Thanks for being with us.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)HANNITY: So remember last week, barely there Joe Biden thought the state of Arizona's wonderful city. Another awkward moment today in his media blitz, including another interview cut short by one of his handlers because he can't handle it.Take a look.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOE BIDEN, D-PRESUMPTIVE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: I'm sorry. I'm confused too I am talking to here. But anyway, whoever it is.And I had nurse at the -- nurses at the Walter Reed Hospital who would been down and whisper in my ear to go home and get me pillows. They would make sure they'd actually probably never anything taught in -- you can't do it during the COVID time, but they would actually breathe in my nostrils to make me move.Wearing a mask now, this is a political statement? This is more patriotic. Why do you wear the mask? So you don't make somebody else sick. Sick.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I want to ask --BIDEN: What is with this guy?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Steve, that's our time.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: OK.All right. Thanks (ph) for your time.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: Time is up.If anyone can interpret that mess, go right ahead.Now, be honest, he was tired. It was time for his nappy.Anyway, beyond Biden's blunders, the constant -- the contrast between the president, his vision, his anima, strength, his mental alertness and his passion for American prosperity versus quid pro quo Joe's -- well, his vision, pleas to the enemy, Bernie Sanders, Bolshevik Bernie's economic plans, AOC, yeah, her New Green Deal plan, Beto Bozo O'Rourke's compensation of guns plan, and Pelosi and Schumer. Wow, a vote for Biden is a vote for Bernie and every extreme radical socialist agenda item ever proposed.Law, order, peace, prosperity, security, safety, it's all on the ballot in just 104 days where you become the ultimate jury.Joining us now to break it all down, FOX News contributor, we call him the architect, Karl Rove.All right, Karl, I need an interpreter. Can you interpret what that is? And they just fade to black now. Joe's losing it, sorry. We are out of time. Beep. You are out.KARL ROVE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Yes, mystifying. I was taken this week with his appearance on Joy Reid's new MSNBC program. He was her inaugural guest. She immediately gives him a chance, says, what do you think of President Trump's handling of the coronavirus? He begins to pummel him for a few moments.So, she then -- which she lets him go, that's what she wants him to do, and then she turns to him and says, well, look, you know, if you're elected, then the pandemics probably is still raging. So walk us through, she says, walk us what you would do differently next year.He then makes seven statements. Every one of the recommendations that he is going to do next year is already being done. He says, I've been talking about the Defense Production Act. Well, President Trump used that in March. He says, we need to have everybody wear masks. Well, the CDC and the White House Coronavirus Task Force recommended that months ago.He said, you know, we need to make sure the businesses continue to be able to stay alive. Well, that's called the CARES Act and it has over 800, nearly $900 billion in forgivable loans to small businesses.We need to make certain nobody, he says, who has COVID, gets -- has to pay for it. Well, the president already did that months ago.And he says, we need to have somebody in command right now in order to oversee the production and distribution of the vaccine. Well, that person is already in place. It is a general who is the head of the Army military command -- materials command and President Trump appointed him May 15th to do exactly that job. He says, and we need to spend $25 billion to do it.Well, Congress appropriated $10 million and the Department of Human and Health Services has found billions more and they're spending it. If they need more they're going to get more from Congress. But, I mean, here it is, he's given a great opportunity to tell us what you would do differently and all seven things that he lays out are things that the administration has exactly done.Can't the guy come up with one new idea, one -- just one, just one new idea? That'd be all we'd ask for.HANNITY: You know, he's also against the travel ban ten days after the first identified case. He's also against the subsequent travel ban, also against the quarantines. Countless, hundreds of thousands of Americans did not attract the virus because of it. It gave us time to kill the PPE that we needed and the ventilators.And Donald Trump did all that and he did it against the recommendations of many. Those three decisions right there he was against. And they saved lives.ROVE: Yes, we've seen Biden before. We've seen him a lot of places. We have had an emergency in our town and somebody says, you know, if I had been in charge, here is what I would have done. Or a big controversy, you know, if I had been the guy in charge, let me tell you, I would do it differently.And they can't do it. Just go look at and better yet read my column tomorrow morning where I lay it out what he says and what was already done. It's just amazing to me. Is this the best the guy can do? I mean, I think what is happening in the basement is he's gotten lazy, mentally lazy. And so, he thinks he can get away with this because he goes on places like Joy Reid and he doesn't get challenged.Let him get in front of a real journalist and see how he handles it. What if somebody said wait a minute, those things that have been done, I ask you, what differently you would do? You haven't suggested anything different. And let's see how he'd answer that. But he's getting away with murder right now, and it is getting to be a mistake for him because he can't keep this up for the 104 days up in the campaign.HANNITY: Would he get away, Karl, would he get away with trying to duck debates?ROVE: No, if he, if he or President Trump said, I'm not showing up at the debates, they will go down. There's no doubt about it. The American people expect him to show up for three debates.The president -- you know, the president has got to be careful because Biden did take care of Paul Ryan and took care of Sarah Palin and the vice presidential debate in '08 and '12. But he's got to show up for \u2018em, and that's going to be a real -- I think the climactic moment of this campaign. The debates are more important than they've ever been since at least 1980.HANNITY: All right. The architect, Karl Rove, thank you.When we come back, important information, tough action the president is taking on China. You won't believe what they did.And, by the way, John Kennedy reacts. That means he's going to have a lot of fun things to say and our big announcement, straight ahead.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)HANNITY: Breaking news today, the Chinese government threatened retaliation on Wednesday after the U.S. ordered the Chinese closed a consulate in Houston, Texas, over concerns it was being used for espionage. This after the DOJ announced that it has charged two Chinese hackers with trying to steal United States coronavirus research.Here with reaction, Louisiana Senator John Kennedy.You've been very outspoken on this. Look, the fact that after all of these years that we had people 30 and 40 years ago hacking into government agencies. If we don't fix this, it annoys the living daylights out of me. At what point is that our problem and our fault?SEN. JOHN KENNEDY, R-LA.: The Communist Party of China has become a world comorbidity, and America allowed it for well over 20 years. Too many of our leaders, Sean, got up every day and they just took the bullet train to chump town (ph). We didn't stand up to China.Now, we are. And we asked other countries to join with us.I don't want a cold war with China. China says -- the communist party in China says it wants respect. You have to earn respect. Respect is not a participation trophy.They have to show that they are willing to be posted stakeholders in a stable law and order. And vernacular, that means they have to agree to stop cheating.HANNITY: Innocent people died because of all of their lies. They now want to steal our information? The intellectual property theft has been a huge problem. Trade imbalance, a huge problem.We now must remove all the manufacturing, especially for vital items like agents of medicines and pharmaceuticals. How do -- what do you propose we do?KENNEDY: The first thing that I would do is ask other -- other members of the Western world to join with us. Australia is already there. The United Kingdom is already there.But I'm thinking specifically of our friends in Europe, the E.U. It's time that the E.U. grew some oranges and said, you know, we stand for something. And --HANNITY: They're weak, Senator. They're weak.KENNEDY: They are weak. And they could be much stronger.But they are so worried about making money from and with China, that in my judgment, they sacrificed their values. I don't mean to overstate it. There have been a few countries that have pushed back, but they need to push back as a group, as an organization, particularly Germany.HANNITY: Well, I agree with everything. People in your state in every state in this country died because of what they did, and around the world. Why wouldn't people unite on that? We have about 20 seconds.KENNEDY: It's not just the coronavirus. It's everything else too, as bad as the coronavirus is, Sean.HANNITY: Yes. All right, Senator, always appreciate you being with us. Thank you, sir.When we come back, our big announcement. That's next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)HANNITY: All right. A lot happening with the president: first, all of the new information on COVID-19. The state of the race, tomorrow, there will be 103 days until Election Day. Then, of course, safety, security, law and order.Nine Eastern, the president of the United States will be joining us for most of the hour right here on \"Hannity\". Set your DVR, you don't want to miss it.Also, in 13 days, my new book, first in 10 years, \"Live Free or Die: America and the World on the Brink\" will be available. Everything you need to know to understand that if Bolshevik Bernie, AOC, Pelosi, Schumer, Biden and Bozo get in power, we're screwed.Let not your heart be troubled -- Laura Ingraham.\n", "comment": "", "topic": "TRANSCRIPT", "date": " July 22"}, {"cover": "https://a57.foxnews.com/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/694940094001/63621aea-be06-4e78-8883-2ac83446ac8f/80641c59-4f38-4ff0-bbda-a356c8e694cb/1280x720/match/156/88/image.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "title": "Democratic Chicago alderman criticizes Mayor Lori Lightfoot over response to federal law enforcement", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/transcript/democratic-chicago-alderman-criticizes-mayor-lori-lightfoot-over-response-to-federal-law-enforcement", "subtitle": "Guests: Raymond Lopez, Gary McCarthy, Josh Hawley, Eva Moskowitz, Alex Berenson, Jennifer Palmieri, Tim Murtaugh", "keyword": "U.S.-China trade war and protectionism", "website": "Fox News", "author": "", "content": "MARTHA MACCALLUM, ANCHOR: Good evening, everybody I'm Martha MacCallum in New York. This is THE STORY as it plays out tonight across America. President Trump's first term candid by calling out carnage in America.Here he is today with a search of federal law enforcement officers that will go to Chicago and Albuquerque. For now, perhaps more places later followed by the words of two Americans who lost innocent loved ones to this violence.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: No mother should ever have to cradle her dead child in her arms because politicians refused to do what is necessary. For this reason today I am announcing that the Department of Justice will immediately search federal law enforcement officers to the City of Chicago.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Children are to be our future. And my 4-year-old son didn't make it to kindergarten. I stand here today as a mother fighting against violence for my son.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Every time I go to bed. Every time I go out into the driveway that memory comes back and it haunts me.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: Those stories were hunting today at the White House. The President pushing this effort hearkens back to what some talked about in his inaugural address has a dark side of America. Remember this?(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: Americans want great schools for their children, safe neighborhoods for their families, crime and the gangs and the drugs that have stolen too many lives and rob their country of so much unrealized potential. This American carnage stops right here and stops right now!(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: So now on the cusp of a new election and a new wave of carnage that followed an economic search, flattened by the virus, economic distress, and now civil unrest. Individuals like this man and woman are making their demands on their government quite clear after they witnessed last night 15 people shot and wounded in their Chicago neighborhood. Listen to their words.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: That was a war out here.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The violence is day in and day out. And it's just unnatural with all of this fighting. It is a war zone. To send in federal troops, because really--(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: He says this is natural this violence, we need more cops and federal troops in Chicago. It's like we are in Iraq or something. Some suggest their problems are not real. But it is all exaggerated for election-year politics.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Sometimes when you analyze his moods and the words he uses and the decisions he makes that we don't look at it as a play for vote. Per se it might be. But it also might be a play to just not leave. It is something that a lot of people who know more about the rise of authoritarianism and things like it or looking at when it comes to this Presidency.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: And the New York Mayor writes to the Attorney General who laid out his battle plan for Urban America Today against the crimes. He said we do not consent do not sent the proposed agent. They have proved to bring way more harm than good.In less than four months from Americans across this country will weigh in and they all of you, will decide on the next President. So tonight we talked to Raymond Lopez a Democrat Chicago Alderman and Gary McCarthy the Former Superintendent of Chicago Police who will react to this new plan.We began tonight with Mr. Lopez. Thank you very much, sir, it is good to have you with us this evening. And I want to start by playing this sound bite today from Mayor Lightfoot who you have had a number of run-ins with. Here was her reaction to the plan.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MAYOR LORILIGHTFOOT, D-CHICAGO: That's not democracy that we saw unfolding on the streets of Portland as a result of this federal action. That is what we call Tierney, a dictatorship. And we are not having it in Chicago.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: What did you think when you heard that?RAYMOND LOPEZ, D-CHICAGO 15TH WARD ALDERMAN: No, it is unfortunate because the Mayor has been going back-and-forth with the President who in order to be perfectly honest, I don't agree on many of his policies.But protecting our citizen should not be a part of partisanship. As a Democrat, seeing my residence, seeing my family is gunned down is not a partisan issue. And for her to go weeks on end tweeting back and forth and making all kinds of comments and then finally admitting yesterday that she is - having the FBI, DEA and ATF come in, those comments that she made, how many lives were lost because of the politics of grandstanding in the City of Chicago?MACCALLUM: You know it is interesting. I think a lot of people you first got on the radar when that audio leaked of one of the meetings that you had with the alderman and the Mayor. But what I noticed when I went back and looked at it today, was that you were pretty much right on target about what was about to happen? Let's play that.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)LOPEZ: My fear is once they are done looting and riding and whatever is going to happen tonight, God help us, what happens when they start going after residents? I want an answer. It is not something you ignore. This is a question that I have.LIGHTFOOT: I think you are honestly full of - is what I think.LOPEZ: No offense but--(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: Wow, you know, I don't know what is going on between you two, but why is she so upset when it is suggested that something should be done to make the cities, streets safer in Chicago?LOPEZ: Well, I think part of the problem that the Mayor has with me is that I run contradictory to the narrative that she keeps trying to portray that she is in charge and she is in command of the COVID situation, the violence, when it is clearly obvious not only to the residents of Chicago and not only myself and I'm sure the Former Superintendent and the entire nation that our city is in chaos and in turmoil.When I can tell the Mayor that, I have addressed these issues in my ward. My ward is like the micro - of the City of Chicago we have poverty, we have working class people, we have gangs, we have violence.We were able to make significant gains in reducing those crimes that's year after year prior to this administration. You know, that message hurts her image. It hurts her personally because it is her micromanaging style. Unfortunately that level of pettiness is causing disaster in the City of Chicago right now.MACCALLUM: So, we have pictures of - you had your home was broken into, attacked, your office was also had shattered windows and glass. So you have been on the front line in this. But you are a Democrat. She is a Democrat. Who characterizes better where the people of Chicago are on this if that is an assessment that can be made?LOPEZ: Well, I think you know obviously we're City of Democrats but we're a city of different kinds of Democrats. I'm more of a middle-of-the-road kind of Democrat who believes that we can't have social justice. We can't have good relations with police and we can't have good safety all in the same city.It is possible and we've done it in my ward. Unfortunately, too many politicians in my city and across this nation find it easier to pander to the lowest common denominator in our society as opposed to challenging people to believe and inspire for something greater.And I, for one, know that can happen in our city again. We just have to start enforcing laws targeting individuals who will not change helping those people who want to change and knowing we can do better moving forward.MACCALLUM: That is pretty reasonable message. Alderman Lopez, we thank you very much for coming on tonight. Good to speak to you, sir.LOPEZ: Thank you Martha.MACCALLUM: So joining me now Gary McCarthy he Former Superintendent of the Chicago Police Department. Gary, good to have you with us again, what did you make of this announcement from the Attorney General Bill Barr and the Acting Homeland Security Director and the President today on what their plan is for your city?GARY MCCARTHY, FORMER CHICAGO POLICE DEPARTMENT SUPERINTENDENT: Listen having been through this a number of times, in New York, we had a search with ATF and we had enormous success. In Newark, we had a search with both DEA and the FBI and not only do we make a lot more good drug arrest that made a difference on the street, but the FBI worked with us on a corruption investigations.And then in Chicago, again, the ATF and the U.S. Marshals Service had a search with us. Again, it contributed to us getting to 50 year lows in the murder rate and in 2013-2014. I think it is a very myopic view. There is a lot of political saber raveling that's going on.If you snipe at the President in Chicago, you get political points for that. I'm sure the President gets points across the country for sniping. And this is happening in Chicago. So the law enforcement gets caught in the middle and so does the--MACCALLUM: You know, with regard to what has been said about this, one of the things that doesn't get talked about a lot is gang violence nature of this. And I wonder if you think as someone who has overseen and worked in several cities as you just pointed out, is the protest and everything that is going on tonight that we have seen over the past few months, does that pull police's attention away and allow the gangs to operate with a little bit more freedom?MCCARTHY: Yes, probably the case, Martha, but there is a much bigger dynamic that's going on for years now when I talk about this frequently. Ever since Ferguson, the police have been on the hills, they have been hamstrung and criminals have been involved in.And here in Chicago, we're seeing exponentially getting worse on a daily basis. Police officers are devastated. They are afraid to do their jobs because they're getting attacked physically emotionally and politically on a daily basis. Excuse me. So yes, there is a lot of that going on but it is a much bigger issue. This is happening across country.MACCALLUM: Chad Wolf was on this program last night and here is part of what he said.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CHAD WOLF, ACTING HOMELAND SECURITY SECRETARY: And so the department because we don't have that local support, that local law enforcement support, we're having to go out and proactively arrest individuals. We need to do that because we need to hold them accountable.This idea that they can attack that old property and law officers and go to the other side of the street and say you can't touch me is ridiculous. We don't do that in any other type of law enforcement.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: You have been now critical about some of what has happened in Portland with these officers in camera, right?MCCARTHY: Absolutely. And again, back to Ferguson, I think I coined the phrase that the police can turn a demonstration into a riot. That is what we did in Ferguson, you know it puts a lot of officers on the front line, confrontation gets met with confrontation.And going back to the 2012 NATO Summit here in Chicago where my executive staff was a guest. When I said that we're going to come out with - and the regular Chicago Police Uniform, they expected to go right into riot gear. And I said well, if you want to have a riot, let's make sure we do that. And the tactics that we used in Portland, very critical of, as far as the search goes--MACCALLUM: But look, I just want to put the video up Gary of what happened on Friday night while you finish your thought here because this is what's in people's minds when they think about the attacks on these police officers.MCCARTHY: Oh, yes, Martha - let's not - let's not confuse ourselves with the issues of not being ready to respond to violence. You know, as I have been saying, you can start out with a soft look but by the same token, you have to be ready to go to battle gear immediately.We need to have those mobile forces ready in riot gear. I'm talking about what we call a - with chest protectors not just uniforms. And I'm tired of listening to people talk about the police being in riot gear when they are wearing a helmet.Every police officer in the United States has a helmet and you use it when you need it. That is different than having a mobile task force that has been trained and worked to extract individuals from crowds who are the agitators, which is going to prevent the next incident from happening.MACCALLUM: Tough times, Gary McCarthy, thank you very much. We will see how this works out and always a pleasure to talk to you too. Thank you very much. So coming up a new report that is just in on what was really going on inside that Chinese Consulate in Houston, brand-new details moments ago, Senator Josh Hawley will respond coming out.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)MACCALLUM: Brand-new reports tonight on what's really going on inside that Chinese Consulate in Houston. Just hours after the U.S. Department ordered it shut down. We saw documents being burned in the courtyard there. Look at that fire there as it lights up in the Houston last night.NBC News is now reporting that this was a base that was used for spying operations on major U.S. industries, including medical research, oil, natural gas. The FBI was aware of this. They had briefed the President on this. And one thing is clear now, we are, it looks like in terms of our two countries and the relationship, quite a long ways from this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Does this change how you feel about President Xi? Is it a change in relationship with him?TRUMP: Look, I finished a trade deal that everybody said it would be impossible to get and not only was a trade deal it a great deal for this country. That was done months before the virus came. I am not going to say anything. I had a very good relationship. He is a strong man. He is a tough man, but I have very good relationship with him.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: It appears at this point to be strange, post-virus and that once promising trade deal now appear to be very much on the back burner. Here is the Secretary of State Mike Pompeo earlier today, watch this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MIKE POMPEO, SECRETARY OF STATE: President Trump has had enough. We are not going to allow this to continue to happen. We are setting up clear expectations how the Chinese Communist Party is going to behave? And when they don't, we're going to take actions to protect the American people, protect our security, our national security and also protect our economy and jobs.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: Republican Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri joins me now, Senator good to have you with us tonight. I guess my question is big picture, right? Are we going to look back on this data point of the closing of this Embassy and the burning of those documents has sort of a flash point of an escalation that leads to ultimately either a cold war or God forbid, a hard war with China over of course the next several years?SEN. JOSH HAWLEY, R-MO.: Well part of standing up to China now, Martha, is to prevent a hot war with them that certainly not what we want but we also can't be pushed around. And look we should be clear about the fact that China is an imperial power that they want to extend their power all around the world.And there is one nation in particular that stands between them and world domination and that is us. We're not going to be pushed around anymore. Today's action with the Consulate I think sends a clear signal to Beijing we're not going to tolerate their spying, we're not going to tolerate their espionage. We're not going to tolerate their breaking of the United States law. We're going to get tough it's about time.MACCALLUM: All right, they're working on a trade deal with EU. They have one relationship in Latin America and Africa. They're clearly sort of lining themselves up to be the next world dominant power which has been their desire for quite some time. How do we stop that?HAWLEY: Well, we stop it by doing what we did today, which is to stand up to them when they cheat, when they lie, it's also to expose their lies globally. For instance what they have lied about all the lies they told with COVID-19, trying to blame the origins of the virus on United States soldiers were having sick, total lie.That's why I've called for an international commission led by the United States to actually get the evidence to make China pay for what they have done to get reparations. But the truth is, Martha that they are on the back put the Chinese government is. You now have our allies waking up to the fact that UK is kicking out.Huawei the Chinese Telecom companies kicking out of United Kingdom. We've already taken those actions. China is in trouble here and they know that. That is why they are trying to double down. This is a moment where we have got to stand firm and say that we will not be pushed around. We will stand up for our people.MACCALLUM: Yes, here is the Former Vice President Joe Biden running for President, of course, on this topic, watch this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOE BIDEN, D-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Look what he's doing now? He's blaming everything on China. He's blaming everything on the Chinese and people don't make mistakes. As you well know from South Korean and someone from Beijing, they make no distinction, it is Asia. That is the way, he is just using it as a wedge, and he's trying to shift the blame.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: Your thoughts.HAWLEY: You know Vice President Biden has long been at China appeaser. He's long been an appeaser of authoritarian to Beijing. Just earlier this year, he was talking about how China didn't pose a real threat to the United States, I mean, oops, that is not exactly the story of 2020.We have seen this year what a threat China is to the world. So the Vice President, I think, is radically out of touch with reality on this as so many issues. But it is dangerous him being this out of touch on China. We need somebody, we need leadership that's going to stand up and be strong on China, be strong for American workers, be strong for American security.MACCALLUM: I just want to play this video. This is 2019 drone video that appears to show blindfolded Uighurs being transported according to one report, from one concentration camp to another. And this is an interview that Bill Hemmer did earlier today with the daughter of someone who is being held in one of these camps. This is really scary video. Listen to her.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JEWHER ILHAM, DAUGHTER OF IMPRISONED UIGHUR: My father is not the only person who is in prison. There are thousands of hundreds of Uighurs just like my father are locked up in a prison or concentration camp.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: Her father is a very well-known Economist in China. What do you think when you see that video, and does it change our relationship even more?HAWLEY: Should change our relationship. It should also inspire us to stand up and hold accountable those American, multinational corporations that have shipped our jobs over to China that are now using these Uighur concentration camps. That is what they are; they are concentration camps using them for cheap labor.That is one of the reasons Martha, I've launched this campaign called \"Slave Free\", #SLAVEFREE and I'm challenging all of these American multinationals beginning with the NBA, NIKE and others that make their products in China that use slave labor to pledge that they will be slave free. And I've introduced legislation to make sure it happens.MACCALLUM: I did read that the NBA is not practicing at one of their training camps in Xingjian anymore, small move but a step in the right direction?HAWLEY: Well, here is what it would be a real step and would show real progress. Are they willing to actually say that they will not make any NBA apparel in China with forced labor? Are they willing to take the pledge that the league does not rely on slave labor for any of its products? Is Lebron James willing to take the pledge that his NIKE products don't rely on slave labor? That come I think, which showed true progress.MACCALLUM: It would show that human rights are an issue, a universal issue that hold true. For these individuals who are obviously you know feel very strongly about human rights in this country. Senator Hawley, thank you good to see you tonight.HAWLEY: Thank you.MACCALLUM: So we're going to dig further into this issue with China because there is a lot of discussion about where our two countries are headed that will probably characterize the next decade of geopolitics.I will speak with the Secretary of State tomorrow night. Please tune in for that. Also up next, as Mayor De Blasio and the Teachers' Unions say there is not enough money to get ready to open the public school in the United States. They are refusing to let charter school students back into the classroom, despite their pleas to get back to work and hit the books early in August. That is next.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Regarding the children and your family, your son and grandchildren come are you comfortable and do you plan to have them back in person in school?TRUMP: Yes, I am comfortable with that.(END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: The radicals want to abolish charter schools and eliminate school choice. I want to expand school choice and every family in America should have that option.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: So as many public schools look forward - look toward learning from home, leaving some parents looking for alternatives. Charter schools are private or catholic schools for this fall, New York City's largest charter school network known as \"Success Academy\" was set to begin their 47 schools in just a few weeks.They always begin on the third week of August in order to get a jump on the school year. But now the mayor says that they can't enter the building that they share space with, with public schools.In an op-ed, Jason Riley writes, in many cases, inner city charter schools' students are outperforming their peers in the wealthiest and whitest suburban school districts in the country. In New York City, for example, the Success Academy charter school have effectively closed the academic achievement gap between black and white students.Success Academy CEO Eva Moskowitz joins me now. Eva, good to have you back on the program tonight. So, you had planned to put 20,000 mostly -- mostly black Latino students. I think the majority are in New York City back into the classroom on August 20th. Why can't that happen?EVA MOSKOWITZ, CEO, SUCCESS ACADEMY: Well, actually the high schoolers were supposed to start on the 4th of August. The mayor of New York would not give up access. And while we're largely free from government, but not in terms of the buildings. We are co-located, and we need the mayor to allow us to enter.And so, we are going to -- we're not whiners. We're going to make lemonade out of lemons. We've done remote learning in the spring. And we are going to offer our kids and families a world-class education remotely until we can open.We have a one-to-one program so all of our kids have devices, tablets with their touch screen. And for the older ones, a laptop. And we're going to make it work.MACCALLUM: Yes. And these are publicly funded schools. And you are making it work. You've got, everybody has got a device, as you say. What's your biggest fear, your biggest concern about these kids not being able to get into the classroom as planned?MOSKOWITZ: Well, in person learning is better. Schools, our communities, for the little ones imagine starting kindergarten and you've never been in your classroom. And you get an e-mail address, and you've to do everything in the rectangular box. It's not totally normal if you can say that.MACCALLUM: Yes, not at all.MOSKOWITZ: But we are going to make it work. We taught every child to read in the spring remotely. We did world history. We did calculus. All of the kids took their A.P.'s online.MACCALLUM: Yes, it's remarkable.MOSKOWITZ: And again, in the building we will make it work.MACCALLUM: I'm sure you will. You don't have a date for when you're going to be back in the classroom, right? You are waiting for New York?MOSKOWITZ: We're waiting for government.MACCALLUM: How many -- do you have -- how many kids are on a wait-list to get into your schools? And have you seen an increase in interest in switching over to your schools?MOSKOWITZ: We have over 15,000 parents on the wait list. It's one of the saddest things ever. We only have room for about 2,700 children. And actually, the poor performance of the district, you know you sent out links and worksheets, not relate teaching has meant that our demand has actually gone up.MACCALLUM: Worse, yes. Is the union playing a role in not getting back to school?MOSKOWITZ: Well, I just think it's a paralysis of government, you know, as a charter, a charter network. We're very agile --MACCALLUM: Absolutely.MOSKOWITZ: -- and nimble because we have some basic freedom.MACCALLUM: Yes. Eva Moskowitz, thank you. Great to see you tonight.MOSKOWITZ: Thank you, Martha.MACCALLUM: Good luck to you. Keep us posted.MOSKOWITZ: Thank you so much.MACCALLUM: Coming up, The New York Times out with a scathing piece on one of its former employees, Alex Berenson, accusing him of downplaying the severity of COVID-19 and cherry picking his facts. Tonight, he will respond here live to those allegations for the very first time on THE STORY, next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)MACCALLUM: New York times railing against one of its former reporters, Alex Berenson, over his critical response to government lockdowns and the media's COVID-19 hike. Writing, Mr. Berenson believes that the impact of the coronavirus is regrettable. Mostly inevitable and overstated that lockdowns are useless, masks don't help, and politicians are too worried about the deaths of old people who are going to die soon anyway.Mr. Berenson plays down counterevidence, even when it is first-hand or expert, writes the New York Times.Here now to respond, Alex Berenson, former New York Times reporter and author of \"Unreported Truths About COVID-19 And the Lockdowns.\" Alex, good to see you tonight.ALEX BERENSON, FORMER REPORTER, THE NEW YORK TIMES: Hi, Martha.MACCALLUM: Your response to this piece that was written by Ben Smith of the New York Times.BERENSON: Martha, honestly, I'm not really that interested in that piece. I have a lot of work to do writing about what's going -- what's happening now with the lockdowns, what we're doing with masks, you know, what's we're doing with vaccine going forward.There are huge public policy issues here on the table, and I think that that's what we should be focused on it. A number of people have written, you know, pieces about me in the last couple of months because they don't like what I write. I tried to write factual, you know, I tried to link everything to government documents or publish stories or (Inaudible) papers --(CROSSTALK)MACCALLUM: But that's what he's questioning. I mean, he did, he attacked you personally as well. He said you were harried and angry and reveling in the fight. But he also went after you in terms of your sources, saying that you, you know, your writing and your reporting flies in the face of the other wisdom that's out there.BERENSON: I mean -- I mean, so look, that source, that piece is actually better than a couple of the other pieces that has been written. You know, he said I was aggressive. Yes, I'm aggressive. I'm an investigative reporter.Like investigative reporters are aggressive. He said I was tall. Guess what, I'm also tall. I'm tall and I'm aggressive and I'm an investigative reporter.I think what's more interesting here is the way that the Times has sort of turned its guns not just on me but on, you know, on you, on Fox. And there used to be, I think a little bit of a sense in the media. You know, your report the news your way. We'll report the news our way. People can, you know, people can watch both and make decisions.MACCALLUM: Right.BERENSON: If the Times is going to start throwing stones about coronavirus courage, there's a lot -- they've made a lot of mistakes in the last couple of months.MACCALLUM: Yes.BERENSON: And one reason that reporters don't like me and it's not just the Times, is that I call people out on the stakes. And let me just give you one example. The last time or barely a week ago, a couple of reporters for ProPublica, a reporter from ProPublica, an NBC News, which of course your competition, wrote a story that was headlined all the hospitals in Houston are full.MACCALLUM: Right.BERENSON: All the hospitals in Houston are nowhere near full. There are 2,500 empty beds in Houston hospitals right now. That story was what I call panic porn.MACCALLUM: Yes.BERENSON: It was deliberately or not. It was an effort it fermented panic and that is wrong.MACCALLUM: Yes.BERENSON: And I'm going to call that out on Twitter. I'm going to call that out on your airwaves, I don't care if my friends in the media don't like me anymore because of it.MACCALLUM: You know, I mean, good for you. And as far as we're -- you know, we're used to it. We get it all the time. So, and we don't care either. So that makes two of us.But, you know, in terms of like the Houston story, for example. And when I say to people, you know, there was never a ventilator shortage in the United States. There's a lot of people who are shocked to hear that. Because people think that people were --BERENSON: That's right.MACCALLUM: -- you know, turned away because they, you know, they died because they couldn't get a ventilator. And you know, a lot of these things that become just sort of common understandings that simply are not true, which is obviously very dangerous here.But I do want to ask you about what Scott Gottlieb said today. Just in terms of the numbers. Because I want to match what you're seeing with what he is seeing. Let's play that.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SCOTT GOTTLIEB, FORMER COMMISSIONER, FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION: In the United States, probably, you know, by the end of the year we could have upwards of 300,000 if we continue on the current trajectory. Right now, we are close to 1,000 casualties a day.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: So, that's a big number, a 1,000 a day. And he says that if we stay on the current trajectory, we could get to 300,000. Does your reporting suggest that that is where we're headed here?BERENSON: Well, I mean, I think it's too early to tell. OK? You know, in the first and someone with unreported truths which Ben Smith actually mentioned in the Times piece, I said that a worst-case scenario here you could have up to 600,000 deaths.Most of those deaths if you look at who is dying occur in people who probably would have died by the year-end anyway. And 600,000 might be over two-year period. But could we get to 300,000? I'm not saying that's not impossible.Here's what I think people need to think about. When scenarios for like influenza pandemics were discussed in the last 15 years, the CDC, the WHO, they talked about in some cases more than two million Americans dying. And even then, they didn't think that mass lockdowns were a good idea.I'm not saying that 300,000 deaths is anything to take lightly.MACCALLUM: Yes.BERENSON: I'm not saying it doesn't mean we shouldn't stand up to hospitals and the nursing homes, but even if we get there, we have to think about the harm that lockdowns do economically, societally, socially, educationally.MACCALLUM: Yes.BERENSON: And I don't think it makes me a bad person or lacking empathy as Ben Smith also said, to think that maybe we should think about children and how and what we're doing is affecting them too.MACCALLUM: Alex, thank you. Alex Berenson always good to talk to you.BERENSON: Thanks.MACCALLUM: We'll see you soon.BERENSON: Thanks, Martha.MACCALLUM: All right. So, the Trump campaign respond to Joe Biden calling the president a racist today, earlier today. We'll talk about that when we come back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: My vision for American cities could not be more different from the lawlessness being pushed by the extreme radical left.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: As President Trump positions himself as the law and order candidate, his campaign has spent millions of dollars on this message.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The radical left-wing march agenda take over our cities, defund the police, pressure more towns to follow, and Joe Biden stands with them.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: That ad comes as the former vice president walks a delicate line, pushing for calm and violence ridden cities, appealing to black voters, and assuring that he can reform policing while also being tough on crime.Trump 2020 communications director Tim Murtaugh joins us in moments. But first, Jennifer Palmieri, former communications director for Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign and author of \"She Proclaims: Our Declaration of Independence from a Man's World.\"Jennifer, good to have you here tonight. Thank you for being here.JENNIFER PALMIERI, FORMER COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR, OBAMA AND CLINTON CAMPAIGN: Thanks, Martha.MACCALLUM: What is your reaction to that? Do you see this as, you know, an agenda that is framed at scaring people?PALMIERI: I do. I do fear of that. You know, it's regrettable, but I do fear that that's what the president is doing. It's interesting. I think that he is trying to, he's trying to strike fear in the hearts of some Americans and then at the same time, I see him trying to reach out to some black Americans.I notice today at the end of his press conference, he talked about how, in his opinion, I don't agree, he's done more for African-Americans than any other president. You know, alongside the times when the Trump campaign has run into ads that you talked about, they're also, I know they're also running ads targeted at trying to reach black voters too.MACCALLUM: Yes.PALMIERI: So, I think there it's a -- it's a -- it's a divide and conquer kind of strategy.MACCALLUM: So, I want to play what Joe Biden said about the president that prompted the response that you just mentioned.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BIDEN: He's spreading of racism, the way he deals with people --UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes.BIDEN: -- based on the color of their skin, their national origin, where they are from, is absolutely sickening. No sitting president has ever done this. Never, never, never. No Republican president has done this. No Democratic president. We've had racists and they've existed. They've tried to get elected as president. He's the first one that has.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: He said the president is racist. The first president in the country's history who is racist. To which the president answered with his response on the economy, prison reform, a number of things that he says a lot of other presidents have tried to do but never accomplished. Is that OK for this candidate, Biden, to call the sitting President of the United States a racist?PALMIERI: I think so in this case. I'm not sure that you and I will agree on this, but I do believe, Vice President Biden is right. The president very regrettable uses racism and fear to divide the country. And I think he does it to scare people.(CROSSTALK)MACCALLUM: Can you give me an example of that of how he's --(CROSSTALK)PALMIERI: The caravan that never -- the caravan that never materialized that he said would, I think to try to motivate people to turn out to vote - -(CROSSTALK)MACCALLUM: There were lots of people that were coming across the border, and they camped out south of the border for months.PALMIERI: Using the bible to, you know, the -- when he went to the church after tear gassing protesters at the Lafayette Square.MACCALLUM: How is that racist?PALMIERI: To suggest that people who protest don't believe in God, I think. I think it's using --(CROSSTALK)MACCALLUM: I think it was because they had burned the part of the church the night before.PALMIERI: It's using the issue to try to divide people. I think, you know, that's the problem. That's what I've never seen a Republican president in my lifetime who is doing this --(CROSSTALK)MACCALLUM: All I'm saying is -- all I'm saying is that if you are going to call someone a racist you better have some very concrete examples of how they are. It's one of the most serious things that you could call someone in the United States of America.PALMIERI: I think --(CROSSTALK)MACCALLUM: And obviously, this is a president who uses very strong language about people on his own, it's usually based on the individual rather than, you know, I see it based on the individual. And he is free with his criticism, there is no doubt about that.PALMIERI: He started his -- he started his campaign saying a lot of rapist -- Mexicans are racist and criminals. You know, he started his campaign with that. Throughout his campaign he has used race to divide and to scare people.MACCALLUM: All right. Let me just ask you one other thing with regard to your book. \"She Proclaims: Our Declaration of Independence from a Man's World.\" You wrote about the incident between AOC and Ted Yoho who called her very nasty names, including the f word and the b word. What is that incident reveal to you?PALMIERI: I actually think, you know, it does not, I mean, obviously, she should not have been subjected to that.MACCALLUM: Yes.PALMIERI: But my point of the piece was she was very able to deal with it. Right? I think that women, you know, what I want the women watching to know is I think all of us have experienced -- I never thought of myself as somebody as a woman working in the men's world. I just thought it was the world and I was doing great in it.And at some point, you realize that we're not making progress. We're not breaking through. I worked as hard as the men and yet the men I worked with even though they were really good colleagues to me and really supportive of me, grow as faster than I did.And I had the epiphany that I'm not doing great in a men's world. I'm doing great making it run and making it run well for them, sort of perpetuating these systems.And the point of the book is to say, like what's in your own mind that you can change to get yourself out of that rut? And I think Ocasio-Cortez with how she handled the situation with Yoho is a pretty good example of that.MACCALLUM: Very interesting. OK. Jennifer, thank you very much. Good to have you here. I hope you'll come back and we'll talk more about the election as it moves forward. It's going to be a feisty one. I know you always bring a lot to the table, so I'm glad you're here. Thank you.PALMIERI: Thanks, Martha.MACCALLUM: So, also here tonight, Trump 2020 communications director Tim Murtaugh. Tim, thank you for being here as well. Your thoughts on Joe Biden saying that President Trump is the first racist president in this country, which as I said, is an extremely serious thing to level at any one.TIM MURTAUGH, TRUMP 2020 COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR: It is. And it's ridiculous. There is a reason why Joe Biden is doing this. And it's because he knows that he's got a really serious problem with black voters in this election.All you have to do is take a look at what Joe Biden is doing. When was the last time, Martha, you can remember that a Democrat presidential campaign in a general election was actually running ads aimed at attracting the support of black voters? It's really unheard of. And the reason he's doing that is because he knows his support among black voters in America is soft. And to get --(CROSSTALK)MACCALLUM: I think we have the numbers here. We can put them up. Tim, sorry to interrupt but he does have a smaller lead with black voters than Hillary Clinton did. She was plus 79, he is plus 75. Obviously. a huge margin but a smaller lead. Go ahead.MURTAUGH: The president -- the president has made great inroads among black voters and among a lot of different voters, Latinos included. And it's because the president has a clear record of support, a clear record of achievement in the black community.Before the coronavirus crisis interrupted the great economy, it was an all- time low unemployment rate for black voters.MACCALLUM: That's true.MURTAUGH: Historic funding for HBCUs, criminal justice reform. Joe Biden, on the other hand is no one to be giving racial justice lectures to. This is a man who has bragged in the past about his great relationships with notorious, racist senators from the past. He bragged about receiving an award for George Wallace.He eulogized the former exalted cyclops of the KKK, Senator Byrd. No one should be listening to a lecture on racial justice from Joe Biden.And it's the president, President Trump who has a great record of achievement on behalf of black voters, and that is something that we are very proud of. Joe Biden, he knows he's got a problem with black voters. That's why he's needing to spend money to advertise to black voters, which Democrat presidential candidates never have to do.MACCALLUM: I think we're all looking forward to these debates. And we hope that they're going to be substantive. But, you know, I think that Joe Biden will have to answer for that charge. And you have to be very specific as I said, it's a very serious charge.Tim Murtaugh, thank you, sir. Good to see you.MURTAUGH: Sure. Thank you, Martha.MACCALLUM: Quick break here. More of \u201cThe Story\u201d when we come back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)MACCALLUM: So that is the story of Wednesday, July the 22nd, 2020. Thanks for being here tonight. As always, the story goes on.

Thank you. Thank you, Dana. Good evening. Welcome to Washington, I'm Bret Baier. Breaking tonight, how to get students back to school safely amid the coronavirus pandemic? The president and first lady participating in what was billed as a national dialogue on the subject earlier today. Vice President Mike Pence was also there. I will speak exclusively with the president's point man on the coronavirus in just a few minutes. We have Fox team coverage, Jonathan Serrie in Atlanta as operation warp speed is getting a big cash infusion in the search for a vaccine, but we begin with correspondent Kristin Fisher at the White House and the effort to get kids back to school on time and out of danger. Good evening, Kristin. KRISTIN FISHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Good evening, Bret. Today we saw an administration-wide push to get schools reopened this fall. They say for the good of students, parents, and the entire U.S. economy. President Trump has been very clear where he stands on this issue but today he took a nap -- took it up a notch and explicitly said that he is going to be pressuring governors across the country to get on board. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: They think it's going to be good for them politically, so they keep the schools close, no way. So we're very much going to put pressure on governors and everybody else to open the schools. FISHER: President Trump is urging governors across the country to follow the lead of Florida Governor Ron DeSantis whose administration has just ordered that all schools reopen in August. During a day-long panel discussion, administration officials from Doctor Deborah Birx to Education Secretary Betsy DeVos made the case that the risk of reopening outweighs the benefits of keeping children home. DR. DEBORAH BIRX, CORONAVIRUS RESPONSE COORDINATOR, WHITE HOUSE: In the rush to just close things down, there was not -- everything was not completely considered in that moment about how we were going to protect our children. BETSY DEVOS, UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF EDUCATION: We can't overstate the importance of the need for schools to be open again and for students to have that opportunity to learn together in person. FISHER: To help make their case, the administration is pointing to the American Academy of Pediatrics which strongly advocates that all policy considerations for the coming school year should start with a goal of having students physically present in school. And in New York City, the vast majority of parents pulled in a survey agreed. BILL DE BLASIO (D), MAYOR OF NEW YORK: 400,000 families responded, I've never heard anything like that and 75 percent of them want their kids back in school in September. FISHER: But other parents are concerned about their children catching the coronavirus in school and spreading it to loved ones in the at-risk age group and some teachers are worried, too. On the opposite end of the spectrum from what Florida is doing, Harvard University just announced that all classes will be online for the entire school year until the spring of 2021 and there are several hybrid options in between. So there is a huge range for educators and parents to consider as they brace for a possible second wave in the fall. DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH: We are still knee-deep in the first wave of this and I would say this would not be considered a wave, it was a surge or a resurgence of infections. (END VIDEOTAPE) FISHER: And today, the World Health Organization announced that they believe that the coronavirus pandemic is accelerating. The same day that President Trump officially pulled out of the organization. Joe Biden though, he is now promising to rejoin the WHO on day one in the White House if, of course, he wins, Bret. BAIER: Kristin Fisher live on the North Lawn. Kristin, thank you. The government is pouring another $1.6 billion to try to develop a vaccine for the coronavirus. Also tonight, more than four dozen hospitals in Florida are reporting that their intensive care units have now reached capacity. Correspondent Jonathan Serrie reports tonight from Atlanta. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JONATHAN SERRIE, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT: As new coronavirus cases surge across the south and west, nearly one in every 100 Floridians has now been infected. Starting Wednesday, Miami-Dade County will suspend short-term vacation rentals and indoor dining at restaurants. JOHNNY CARDONA, MENSWEAR STORE MANAGER: We might be getting lockdown for another three month. What's going to happen to this business owner? We don't know. SERRIE: After meeting with health advisors, the mayor tweeted, we arrived at a compromise to keep gyms and fitness studios open. All doing activities inside must wear a mask or do strenuous training outside staying 10 feet apart without mask. In hard-hit Texas, organizers of the state fair which drew more than 2-1/2 million visitors last year, announced they're canceling the event for the first time since World War II. In New York, state health officials issued a report suggesting Governor Andrew Cuomo's controversial and now discontinued policy requiring nursing homes to accept COVID-19 patients discharged from hospitals was not a significant factor in spreading the virus. Instead, the primary sources were infected visitors and staffers, many with no symptoms. DR. HOWARD ZUCKER, NEW YORK STATE HEALTH COMMISSIONER: The employee infections were related to the larger community spread and employee transmission has the strongest correlation to a nursing home fatalities. Admission policies were not a significant factor in nursing home fatalities. SERRIE: The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and Department of Defense announced a $1.6 billion agreement with pharmaceutical company Novavax to speed research and development of a potential COVID-19 vaccine under operation warp speed. STANLEY ERCK, CEO, NOVAVAX: This whole issue is unprecedented, the speed, the scale that we have to get to, that's going to require a lot of more work and luck and success, but we're confident in our platform. (END VIDEOTAPE) SERRIE: And Bret today, the University of Washington's Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation expanded its forecast for COVID-19. It is now projecting more than 208,000 U.S. deaths by October 1st, that's up from its previous projection of 175,000, Bret. BAIER: We've seen some back and forth with that organization before, we will track that. Jonathan, as always, thank you. Breaking tonight, if you or more likely your children, enjoy using the TikTok app, you should be aware the U.S. government may ban it soon. There are increasing concerns over the social media outlet and its ties to the Chinese government and what's coming out of it. State department correspondent Rich Edson shows us. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) RICH EDSON, FOX NEWS CHANNEL STATE DEPARTMENT CORRESPONDENT: This is TikTok, a popular app where users can record, edit, and interact with short videos. 30 million Americans use it but the Trump administration is considering banning the Chinese-owned company in the United States over security concerns. MIKE POMPEO, SECRETARY OF STATE: We're taking this very seriously, we're certainly looking at it. EDSON: U.S. officials tell Fox News discussions around possibly banning TikTok are in the early stages. Saying the administration is prepared to counter any app that spies on Americans. Chinese tech firm ByteDance which owns TikTok is denying the claims. The company says it stores American user's data in servers within the United States with a backup in Singapore that none of that information is subject to Chinese law and quote, TikTok is led by an American CEO. We have never provided user data to the Chinese government, nor would we do so if asked. U.S. Officials say TikTok is among other Chinese-owned apps they're evaluating. For years, the administration has led an international campaign to convince countries to curtail or ban Chinese software and equipment, claiming they expose sensitive data to Chinese government. (END VIDEOTAPE) EDSON: FBI Director Christopher Wray says of the FBI's nearly 5,000 counterintelligence cases, nearly half are related to China and China is actively working to compromise American institutions and companies that are researching COVID-19, Bret. BAIER: Rich Edson at the state department. Rich, thank you. Let's talk about where things stand right now in the fight against the coronavirus and the challenges with China as well. \u00a0We're joined by the man in charge of the Coronavirus Task Force, Vice President Mike Pence. \u00a0Mr. Vice President, thanks for being here. \u00a0MIKE PENCE, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Thank you, Bret. \u00a0BAIER: Why is it so important to open up schools this fall? \u00a0PENCE: Well, we had a very important summit today, a good conference call with the nation's governor. \u00a0And President Trump has made it clear, as we open up America again, we need to open up America's schools. And from early on in this pandemic, the CDC has been giving guidance on how we can safely mitigate and operate schools. \u00a0New guidance was issued last week. But I must tell you that parents around America, teachers around America -- and we trust leaders all across this country -- are going to continue to work, continue to find ways to open our schools up again. \u00a0The good news is, 47 states have already issued plans and guidance for doing just that. And we are going to continue to work very closely with them. \u00a0We just think it is important to get America back to work, it is important to get our kids back to school, and all of that can be done as we continue to make sure that states that are seeing rising cases have the testing, the personal protective equipment, and have the medicines to be able to confront this pandemic, even as we open up America again. \u00a0BAIER: The president said today, Mr. Vice President, that he was going to pressure the governors to open, if they didn't. \u00a0I just want to ask you what that looks like. If the governors, as what happened with the lockdown, make their own individual decisions, based on what their state is doing or going through and what health experts are telling them, what does that pressure look like? How does it manifest? \u00a0PENCE: Well, I think, today, the president brought together teachers, healthcare leaders. We all reflected on what I believe is the overwhelming opinion of the American people, that we have got to get our kids back to school. \u00a0And so today was very much about the president doing like he is wont to do, is focusing on this important need. \u00a0But I must tell you, whether it be the American Association of Pediatrics that put out a statement last week about the importance of classroom learning, the -- what we are hearing from educators and parents around America, that we can't let our kids fall behind academically. \u00a0But, also, Bret, you know, you are a parent. You understand that it's far beyond academics, that millions of families rely on our local schools. \u00a0Many -- many of our children that struggle with emotional challenges or disabilities, they receive those services at school. Add into that nutrition. Add into that other ways that we serve our kids. \u00a0It's absolutely essential that we get back to school. And the president is going to continue to focus effort on that, but also work with our governors to see those plans implemented. \u00a0The one point that we made today with governors on our conference call, Bret, was, as the CDC has issued renewed guidance last week on how we can safely operate our schools, we wanted to make it clear, we don't want the federal government to be the reason why you don't reopen your local school. \u00a0BAIER: Yes. \u00a0PENCE: We want to work with local officials, school officials, governors in states around the country to find a way to safely reopen our schools. \u00a0BAIER: I think... \u00a0PENCE: And we believe that we can do that for most of the country. \u00a0BAIER: Mr. Vice President, I think there is unity that parents want their kids back to school. \u00a0PENCE: Yes. \u00a0BAIER: I do think that you hear that, no matter the ideology, the political ideology. \u00a0But do you believe, as the president said today, that Democrats want to keep schools closed for political reasons? You talk to these governors, Democrats and Republicans. \u00a0PENCE: Well, look, I -- let me leave the governors out of it for just a second to say they're -- when we hear some word about teachers unions beginning already to say that they're not going to be willing to come back in some jurisdictions around the country, look, we all ought to be working together on this. \u00a0I mean, as I said at the top, to open up America, we have got to open up America's schools. It's absolutely essential. \u00a0I didn't even mention the fact that the academic well-being, the health and well-being of our kids is of paramount importance. But let's remember working families. Let's remember single parents. \u00a0I mean, for people to be able to go back to work full-time this fall, we have got to have these schools up and running and working. \u00a0BAIER: Yes, I hear you. \u00a0PENCE: And so, what -- the president made it clear today, shot across the bow, anybody that wants to play politics on this thing is on fair notice that we're not going to put up with it. \u00a0And I really believe that the overwhelming majority of the American people, of families, of educators all know we can get back to school, we can get back to school safely, K-12, higher education. \u00a0And our White House Coronavirus Task Force is going to continue to work very closely with Republican and Democrat governors to get that done. \u00a0BAIER: Well, let's hope it happens. \u00a0Today, the administration just pulled out of the World Health Organization. \u00a0Not surprisingly, Joe Biden put out a tweet, saying he would join it, if he gets elected, on the first day. \u00a0But your fellow Republican Lamar Alexander, chairman of the Senate Health Committee, put out this statement moments ago, saying, \"I disagree with the president's decision. Certainly there needs to be a good, hard look at mistakes the World Health Organization might have made in connection with the coronavirus, but the time to do that is after the crisis has been dealt with, not in the middle of it. Withdrawing U.S. membership could, among other things, interfere with clinical trials that are essential to the development of vaccines, which citizens of the United States as well as others in the world need.' \u00a0Is now the right time to be doing this move? \u00a0PENCE: Well, it's absolutely the right time to notify Congress. \u00a0With all due respect to Senator Alexander's view, the World Health Organization let the world down, and by -- by not informing the United States and the wider world of this pandemic as it began in China, as giving ill-fated advice in January and February. It -- there have to be consequences to this. \u00a0But, look, I will be honest with you. I'm not surprised Joe Biden wants to -- wants to keep us roped into another international organization. I mean, Joe Biden actually condemned President Trump's actions when he suspended all travel from China at the end of January. \u00a0You know, the fact that the president did that, I can tell you firsthand, Bret, that bought our nation invaluable time to reinvent testing, to spin up hundreds of millions of personal protective equipment and supplies, to begin the process of pursuing medicines, therapeutics, and vaccines. \u00a0If -- if Joe Biden would've had his way, we literally would've had tens of millions of more Chinese coming into our country and spreading the pandemic and putting more and more Americans at risk. \u00a0BAIER: I want to talk to you (ph) -- \u00a0PENCE: So, right decision on the WHO. Joe Biden would've made the wrong decision in January. \u00a0BAIER: Apologize for the delay. \u00a0I want to talk to you about China in just a minute. \u00a0But just to wrap up the coronavirus -- \u00a0PENCE: Yes. \u00a0BAIER: And you lead this task force. Obviously, the numbers are going up. The president wants us to focus on death rate. And we do. And I will mention that in a minute. \u00a0The administration critics say the president constantly downplays the seriousness of COVID-19. And they say he speaks in optimism, not reality. \u00a0Take a listen to this. \u00a0(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) \u00a0TRUMP: We have tested almost 40 million people. By so doing, we show cases, 99 percent of which are totally harmless. \u00a0THOMAS BOSSERT, FORMER WHITE HOUSE HOMELAND SECURITY ADVISER: We have to start at the basics and level with people. Suggesting that it's not dangerous is, in itself, a dangerous message. \u00a0(END VIDEO CLIP) \u00a0BAIER: Mr. Vice President, Tom Bossert obviously served in the administration with you. \u00a0Health experts say it's just not the case that only 1 percent of cases, COVID cases, that they're dangerous. It's more than that. \u00a0So, is there a messaging problem here with the virus? \u00a0PENCE: Well, look, the American people know President Trump is an optimist. He believes in this country. \u00a0But he also believes the American people deserve to have the whole story. I mean, the reality is, because of what the president did in suspending all travel to China, we were able to stand up a national response that has saved hundreds of thousands, and perhaps even millions, of American lives. \u00a0We have rising cases right now along the South, Bret. I was in Texas and Arizona and Florida last week. And the good news is, is, as we told governors again today, we have the resources to support all the testing that they need. \u00a0We have new therapeutic medicines that -- like remdesivir, that have been distributed all across the country. And we have literally tens of millions of personal protective equipment supplies in reserves, even though I heard from the governors that I personally met with that the PPE effort by the national government has been so strong that the hospitals all across the Sunbelt that are seeing rising cases have more than enough PPE. \u00a0What they did request of us, and the president authorized, was us to send additional doctors and nurses. We are in the process of doing that in all four of the larger states that have been impacted so far. And we will do it in any other states that request it. \u00a0BAIER: Right. On the -- \u00a0PENCE: But what the president wants the American people to know is that our national response, whether it be testing, whether it be PPE, whether it be the supplies and the medicines, has saved American lives. \u00a0More than two months ago, Bret, we were losing 2,500 Americans a day, and there was a day just recently where we only lost 250 Americans. \u00a0BAIER: Right. \u00a0PENCE: That's a 90 percent reduction in fatalities. \u00a0BAIER: So -- \u00a0PENCE: It's a credit to the American people, to all the sacrifices they have made, to our healthcare workers. \u00a0But, ultimately, it's a credit to our national response, which has secured one of the lowest mortality rates in the world. \u00a0BAIER: Right. \u00a0Now, you talk about mortality. Dr. Fauci said today that it's a false narrative to take comfort in the lower rate of death, because there are so many things very dangerous about this disease. Don't get yourself into false complacency. \u00a0You are right about the mortality rates. But some experts are saying they drag behind, with the cases going up, that the death rates -- well, let's hope not, but they may follow. \u00a0Here -- Dr. Fauci also said that state and local governments should mandate mask-wearing, especially if there is an outbreak there. Do you agree with that recommendation? \u00a0PENCE: Well, we -- what we agree with is whatever state and local officials determine is appropriate for their area. \u00a0I mean, from the very beginning, President Trump has made it clear that we are going to support our governors, we are going to support local health officials in taking the steps that they deem are most appropriate. \u00a0But back to Dr. Fauci, who I have worked with very closely now for four months, you know, the -- I can assure you, there is no complacency in the administration. \u00a0And the president isn't referring to the lowest mortality rate in the world as a reason for complacency. He just -- he wants the American people to know that we have made progress combating this pandemic because of all the sacrifices they have made. \u00a0And we are going to continue to make sure that states across this country, particularly across the Sunbelt, have the resources and the supplies to do everything in their power, with those incredible healthcare workers in those hospitals, to keep those losses low, again, the lowest in the world by several measures. \u00a0It's a credit to the American people. And we are not going to relent in our effort to make sure that our states have the testing resources to identify people -- \u00a0BAIER: Yes. \u00a0PENCE: -- have the PPE to render healthcare, have the extraordinary medicines like remdesivir, like the steroid treatment, like convalescent plasma, that are really bringing real relief and restoring health to Americans. \u00a0It's -- \u00a0BAIER: Mr. Vice President -- \u00a0PENCE: We just -- we owe it to the American people to give them the whole story. \u00a0And while you see cases rising -- and, frankly, some in the media want to focus exclusively on rising cases -- the American people deserve to understand that we are making progress in this pandemic. It's because of all that they have done. \u00a0And we are going to make sure every state and every community that has rising cases and rising positivity rates has everything they need to meet the moment. \u00a0BAIER: Mr. Vice President, I wanted to give you time to talk about that. \u00a0There -- your shot just dropped out for a second. \u00a0If you wouldn't mind, I do want to ask you about China. \u00a0PENCE: Sure. \u00a0BAIER: Do you have a second on the other side of this break? \u00a0PENCE: You bet. \u00a0BAIER: OK. \u00a0We will be back with the vice president of the United States after this. \u00a0(COMMERCIAL BREAK) \u00a0BAIER: Again, joined by the vice president of the United States. \u00a0Mr. Vice President, thank you for sticking around. \u00a0PENCE: You bet. \u00a0BAIER: On China, Secretary of State Pompeo said you all are considering the banning of this Chinese-owned app TikTok. \u00a0The FBI director spoke out very aggressively with me, and then gave a speech this week about China. \u00a0You have spoken out a couple of times aggressively about China. \u00a0PENCE: Yes. \u00a0BAIER: Is China our enemy? \u00a0PENCE: Well, there's no question China is a strategic competitor with -- \u00a0BAIER: Lost the feed there from the vice president. \u00a0Let's see if we reestablish this connection. Don't think we have him up. \u00a0Mr. Vice President, can you hear me? \u00a0OK, we will try to reestablish that connection. Oh, here we go. \u00a0Sorry for the interruption, Mr. Vice President. \u00a0You were saying on China? \u00a0PENCE: Well, no one's been tougher on China than President Donald Trump, Bret. \u00a0I mean from very early on, this president stood strong to reset an imbalanced trading relationship that previous administrations allowed to develop in a way that, when we took office, half of our international trade deficit was with China. \u00a0The president stood strong. He also made it clear that we are going to defend our strategic interests in the region. Two aircraft carriers in the South China Sea as we speak is evidence of our commitment to continue to remain an Asian-Pacific power and preserve freedom of navigation. \u00a0But I must tell you that, whether it be the stand on Huawei, or what we're currently considering with TikTok, this president also made it clear that we are going to preserve the national security interests of the United States of America from being compromised by the Chinese Communist Party. \u00a0And so, these entities, whether it be Huawei and perhaps even TikTok, that represents a threat to the privacy and to the security of the country, we will continue to take a strong stand. \u00a0BAIER: I want to end with this, turning to topics that the president brought up this week. \u00a0Did NASCAR make the right move banning the confederate flag? \u00a0PENCE: Well, let me say that we respect the right of private organizations to make the decisions that they deem appropriate for their organization and for their fan base. \u00a0But, at the end of the day, the president -- as he said again today, he believes in freedom of speech -- will always stand for that for every American. \u00a0But I must tell you that being a part of an administration that saw the lowest unemployment rate ever recorded for African-Americans, that we heard again today at our education summit has made historic investments in Historically Black Colleges and Universities, working to open up those schools and all of our schools around America as we speak, expanding Opportunity Zones, I think people, whether it be African-Americans or any American, looks at the record of this administration, and knows that this is a president who is committed to being president for all of the American people and to seeing all of the American people live the American dream. \u00a0BAIER: Yes. \u00a0I guess the state of Mississippi removed the confederate symbol from its flag. And Republicans in that state said, like Roger Wicker, it was the right thing to do. It's a symbol that more and more represents a day in the past that we don't want to celebrate. \u00a0And some of those Republicans thought there was a disconnect, at least, in what was tweeted out by the president. You're saying there's not? \u00a0PENCE: Well, there's not. \u00a0And we fully respect the decision made by the people of Mississippi going forward. \u00a0And quite apart from the whole issue of the confederate flag, I just think it's the question of -- as the president said at Mount Rushmore, we are going to defend the great and long story (ph) history of this country. \u00a0We have been on a relentless journey toward a more perfect union. We went through a terrible Civil War; 600,000 Americans died on both sides to end slavery. We saw the advance in my lifetime of the civil rights movement, at great cost. \u00a0And we are going to continue to celebrate all of the ideals of this country, the contributions of every American, of every race and creed and background. \u00a0And this president, in a very real sense, I promise you, is going to continue to defend America and defend America's great traditions against those who want to tear down statues, who want to erase our history. \u00a0We believe that we can learn from our history, we can move forward together, and that's how we are going to have a more united United States of America. BAIER: Mr. Vice President, we really appreciate your time, your extra time, thank you for sticking around, and we'll see you down the road. PENCE: Thank you, Bret. BAIER: Up next, we'll have the other day's news. Stay here on SPECIAL REPORT. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BAIER: Breaking just before the show tonight, the top U.S. general in the Middle East says he was aware of intelligence about a Russian bounty program targeting American troops in Afghanistan, but CENTCOM commander General Kenneth McKenzie says that while he found it worrisome, he did not believe it was tied to actual death on the battlefield and saw nothing of that. We'll continue to follow that story. In tonight's Democracy 2020 report, even in these uncertain time, Joe Biden can count on at least one primary election vote tonight, his own. The presumptive Democratic nominee participated in the election in Delaware. It comes as we learn new details of how President Trump is trying to frame his challenger and whether that's working. Here is correspondent Peter Doocy. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PETER DOOCY, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: President Trump is trying to peg Joe Biden as a figurehead surrounded by radical leftists. DONALD TRUMP, (R) PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Sleepy Joe, and he wouldn't call the shots. He would have nothing to do with it. Lock him in the Oval Office, let's just do what we want to do. DOOCY: But in a new memo, the Biden campaign argues lines like that aren't landing. Quote, \"The reality, while Donald Trump is desperately trying to paint Biden is out of the mainstream, Trump's record of shoveling taxpayer money to big corporations, cutting taxes for the wealthy, and suing to take away protections for people with preexisting conditions couldn't be any further from the values of ordinary Americans.\" Now part of the team that helped Barack Obama get elected twice argues this president's approach could hurt all Republicans up in November. JIM MESSINA, OBAMA 2012 CAMPAIGN MANAGER: What President Trump needs to do is become president and pull the country together, and instead he's spending his whole time attacking everyone but himself, and it's doing real damage. DOOCY: President Trump's former chief of staff agrees. MICK MULVANEY, INCOMING ACTING WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF: I think he's got some real headwinds to face. DOOCY: But he has some ideas about how President Trump can turn things around. MULVANEY: The president can go back to drawing those contrasts between him and Joe Biden. If it becomes a race between Trump and Biden, I think the president does extraordinarily well. DOOCY: The DNC is now working closer with the Biden campaign than they ever did with the Clinton campaign, as Democrats cross their fingers their side doesn't get overconfident. MESSINA: We are the party that screwed up 2016 and lost to Donald Trump in the first place. (END VIDEOTAPE) DOOCY: Joe Biden just did his part to help Joe Biden to be Trump, and it has nothing to do with a speech or a policy paper. He voted by mail in his home state's primary. So he did as much as any Delaware resident can. Bret? BAIER: Peter, thank you. Be sure to check out my podcast \"The Campaign.\" It comes out every Tuesday, 5:00 p.m. Peter is on there. You can download it at = or wherever you download podcasts. It's a great panel discussion, update on the state of the race right now week to week. Stock were off today. The Dow lost 397, the S&P 500 fell 34, the Nasdaq finished down 90. Up next, President Trump's niece spills some of what she says are family secrets. We have the book and a report. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BAIER: We're getting our first look at some of the explosive claim in a new book by President Trump's niece. We have the book. Correspondent David Spunt has the details. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KAYLEIGH MCENANY, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: It's a book of falsehoods. DAVID SPUNT, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: That book is \"Too Much and Never Enough, How My Family Created the World's Most Dangerous Man,\" 200 pages that tell a story of dysfunction and the rise to power. Mary Trump spills alleged family secrets and private conversations. Without providing proof, she claims that more than 50 years ago, her uncle, who she calls \"Donald\" throughout the book, paid a friend to take his SAT test help him get accepted at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, writing \"That was much easier to pull off in the days before photo IDs and computerized records. Donald, who never lacks for funds, paid his buddy well.\" It's an accusation the White House denies. Mary Trump is the daughter of the president's late brother Fred. She recounts the stress from her father's death in 1981 following a battle with alcoholism. DONALD TRUMP, (R) PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Great guy, best looking guy, best personality, much better than mine. (LAUGHTER) TRUMP: But he had a problem. SPUNT: Mary Trump recalls an alleged conversation with her aunt, retired federal judge Maryanne Trump Barry, in 2015. According to Mary, her onset \"He's using your father's memory for political purposes,\" Maryanne said, \"and that's a sin, especially since Freddy should have been the star of the family.\" She claims the president's sister doubted his election prospects and called him a clown. DONALD TRUMP, (R) PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I, Donald John Trump, do solemnly swear. SPUNT: Mary has seldom been in touch with the president, admitting she was estranged from his immediate family for years, cut out of her grandmother's will and unwelcome at her funeral. The book comes just weeks after former National Security Advisor John Bolton released his tell-all of his time in the White House and two months before a book about the First Lady from former aide Stephanie Winston Wolkoff is set to hit shelves. KELLYANNE CONWAY, COUNSELOR TO PRESIDENT TRUMP: We imbue instant credibility onto anybody, especially those not under oath and writing works of fiction, perhaps, or a fiction within a work of fiction, as long as they are out there to get the president. (END VIDEOTAPE) SPUNT: This is the book, Bret. President Trump's younger brother Robert fought in court to block the book's release, arguing that Mary signed a confidentiality agreement. After bouncing back and forth to several judges, the book is scheduled for release one week from today. No comment tonight from the president's sister, Judge Trump Barry, about the book. Bret? BAIER: OK, David, thank you. There are a lot of questions tonight concerning what we know and what we don't know about the coronavirus. Correspondent Doug McKelway looks at some of them this evening. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DOUG MCKELWAY, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Two months after his first appearance on Florida beaches, the ominously dressed lawyer Daniel Uhlfelder came back to the beach as the Grim Reaper, as if to prove his earlier warnings about COVID-19 research. But 120 days in, there's still much unknown. The president tweeted yesterday \"Cases up because of massive testing, deaths are down, low and steady.\" The tweet is largely true. DR. MARC SIEGEL, NYU LANGONE MEDICAL CENTER: Case numbers have doubled over the past few weeks, but I'm seeing a decreasing in trends yesterday, 47 deaths. Deaths are extremely low. MCKELWAY: Nationwide, positive cases are at 44,953 in the last week, but deaths are up only 325. That's a distinction not made in some reporting, and many experts still maintain some states reopened too soon. DR. TOM FRIEDEN, FORMER CDC DIRECTOR: If you open when cases are still increasing, as many states did, it's like leaning into a left hook. You're going to get hit hard, and that's what's happening. MCKELWAY: The south and west is where heat and ultraviolet sunlight were expected to slow the spread. One suggestion is that stifling summer heat is driving people to the air-conditioned indoors, where the virus may thrive. The Cleveland Clinic notes that air-conditioning moves air around in a room, but sys there's is no clear evidence it spreads the virus. Another unknown -- is it possible to be re-infected with COVID-19? The CDC finds, quote, \"The immune response, including duration of immunity, is not yet understood.\" (END VIDEOTAPE) MCKELWAY: Another question -- do masks really help? Early on in the pandemic, Surgeon General Adams cautioned against using them, but now that the disease has determined to be transmissible, he says they can make all the difference. Bret? BAIER: Dr. Fauci and Dr. Birx do, too. Doug, thank you. Up next, the panel on the coronavirus, schools, testing, and my interview with Vice President Pence. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES: \u00a0We are still knee-deep in the first wave of this. The current state is really not good. DR. DEBORAH BIRX, WHITE HOUSE CORONAVIRUS RESPONSE COORDINATOR: In the rush to just close things down, there was not -- everything was not completely considered in that moment about how we were going to protect our children. DONALD TRUMP, (R) PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We want to get our schools open. We want to get them open quickly, beautifully in the fall. MIKE PENCE, U.S. VICE PRESIDENT: It's far beyond academics that millions of families rely on our local schools. Many of our children that struggle with emotional challenges or disabilities, they receive those services at school. (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: Opening up the schools a priority, Vice President Pence talking about it on the show earlier. Let's bring in our panel, Charles Hurt, opinion editor for \"The Washington Times,\" Mara Liasson, national political correspondent for National Public Radio, and Jonah Goldberg, editor in chief of \"The Dispatch.\" Mara, it's obviously a priority. The president is saying he's going to pressure governors if they don't do it. But as we saw in the lockdown, eventually governors make the call in those states and localities. MARA LIASSON, NATIONAL POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, NATIONAL PUBLIC RADIO: \u00a0Yes. And look, every parent wants their kids to go back to school. Speaking for myself, that's true. But the big question is will reopening the schools take the same path as reopening other parts of the economy, where after you did that in certain states you had spikes. Sometimes classrooms can be petri dishes, and even if kids are not affected by the virus as much, teachers can be. So it's really important to get it right, and I know schools all over the country including my own kids schools are struggling with how to do it, how many kids should go back in the classroom at once, what kind of distancing do you impose. So this is a tricky problem. BAIER: And Jonah, there is obviously a disparity across the country with the ability of do some kind of hybrid or distance-learning where they come in, and if there's an issue then they go onto the computer. Not everybody has the same connectivity. JONAH GOLDBERG, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: It's not even just a state by state or jurisdiction by jurisdiction, it's also a level of school by level of school thing. Little kids are going to have different requirements than high school kids. Some states in warmer climates could figure out ways to do classes outside. You can't really ask Minnesota students to do a lot of classes outside in the fall and winter. So there's so much variation here. And I think it's very smart of the administration to talk about how much they want the schools to open because everybody agrees with that, but the devil is in the details, and it's a very strange disconnect to say that masks should be a state by state local issue, but schools should uniformly open all across the country. I think that's a real logistical hurdle for them. BAIER: Right, the two mandates there. Charlie? CHARLES HURT, OPINION EDITOR, \"WASHINGTON TIMES\": I actually think that its' -- I agree with Jonah that it's very wise for the administration to be talking about the importance of opening up schools. But I'd say going into the election, we have a very clear difference between that candidates, between President Trump and Vice President Joe Biden. Voters will have a real opportunity to pick between the two strategies. And I have to say that I do think the notion that you are pressuring localities to make those decisions at a local level is probably a very wise one. But meanwhile, pressuring people to open up is also a very important step in all of that. But at the end of the day we will have a referendum on this. BAIER: Mara, I want to turn to China. You have the FBI director, the secretary of state, now the vice president very aggressively talking about it, seems like it is coming to a head with some more executive actions about China. The trade deal, is it up in the air or not? We didn't really get there. But it seems like it also is going with campaign to pin China on Joe Biden. LIASSON: Yes, this is really tricky because the president wants the trade deal, but he also wants to be as tough on China as possible, because the argument that he's been pushing is that Joe Biden was too soft on China. China is one of the biggest contrasts he's trying to make, and I think the Biden campaign is trying as hard as they can to not make it easy for the Trump campaign to do that, returning fire, saying John Bolton's book, other evidence that we have that President Trump has been too easy on China. And I think you're just going to see this unfold, whether it's TikTok, Huawei, all sorts of other front lines. But China and that U.S. are decoupling, and its big flash point in the campaign. BAIER: And it's a big flash point in the world, Jonah. GOLDBERG: No, it is. I think it's baked into the cake that we're going to be entering an era of hawkishness towards China. The only question is going to be whether it's going to be dumb hawkishness and smart hawkishness, because we definitely need to push back on China. China needs to get that message. We need allies in the region, and I fear that this campaign, we're not going to get a lot of smart hawkery, and we're going to get a lot of pandering from both campaigns. BAIER: Oh, come on, it's a campaign. (LAUGHTER) BAIER: We'll see. GOLDBERG: I know you're shocked. BAIER: Yes, shocked, shocked. Thank you all, panel. When we come back, the brighter side of things, some good news. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BAIER: Finally tonight, as promised, the brighter side, helping each other out. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) (MUSIC) (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: Twice a week at 6:00 p.m., Damaris Silva serenades sick patients and staff at a Chilean hospital with her violin. She walks the halls for several hours playing the mix of popular Latin songs, very welcome. From Chile to Alabama. When a customer at a restaurant in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, noticed an employee walking to work, the generous stranger decided to help out. The restaurant film to the employee being led to his new car as colleagues shared in the surprise from the anonymous donor. Now that is something you don't see every day. Thanks for inviting us into your home tonight. That's it for this SPECIAL REPORT, fair, balanced, and unafraid.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.MARTHA MACCALLUM, ANCHOR: Good evening everyone. I'm Martha MacCallum in New York and this is \"The Story.\" Tonight, an exclusive interview with the Vice President of the United States, Mike Pence. He was in COVID-19 briefings much of the day and will update us on that.But also tonight, anybody who was watching the questioning of Attorney General Barr today by the House Judiciary Committee could not help but be struck by the fact that, although the committee had pressed very hard to get the A.G. before them for a good grilling, what we saw was a good badgering and a lot of grandstanding with little apparent interest in allowing him to explain any of his answers. And that is so by really any objective assessment. Watch this for yourself.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)WILLIAM BARR, ATTORNEY GENERAL: Actually, I need to answer that question.REP. JOE NEGUSE, D-COLO: Mr. Attorney General, you did answer the question.BARR: No, you said under penalty of perjury. I'm going to answer the damn question.NEGUSE: Reclaiming my time.BARR: Yes, I'm answering your question.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Well you got to let him answer.NEGUSE: I'm reclaiming my time.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You think as the Chief - reclaiming my time.REP. JIM JORDAN, R-OHIO: If you want the Attorney General to come, at least let him answer the questions and the accusations made against him.BARR: Can we take a five-minute break, Mr. Chairman?REP. JERRY NADLER, D-N.Y.: No.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: No. Sorry, no five-minute break. Congressman Eric Swalwell was one of those questioners. We're going to talk to him about what happened in there today later in the program. But now we turn to the Vice President who has led the nation's response to the COVID-19 pandemic.Welcome Mr. Vice President. Good to have to you with us this evening.VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE: Good to be with you, Martha. Thank you.MACCALLUM: I just want to first - good to have you sir. I want to get your reaction to what happened in there today. You spent many years on the Hill representing Indiana. What did you think about that committee hearing today with Attorney General Barr?PENCE: Well, it was clear that the Democrats on the committee wanted to be heard more than they wanted to listen. Bill Barr is leading the Justice Department in this country with great integrity and he brings a lifetime of commitment to the rule of law.But to see it today in a little bit that I was able to watch, Martha, it was clear that the Democrats wanted to hear themselves talk more than they wanted to hear from the Attorney General of the United States.MACCALLUM: Yes. I mean I think that's just a fact. I think if we added up the time, I think it would prove to be a fact. Here is one of the thrust of today's hearing, which I wanted to ask you to address and it's the argument that the administration is basically fear mongering what's going on in Portland and beyond in order to leverage law and order election. Watch this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)NADLER: The President wants footage for his campaign ads. In most of those cities, the protests had begun to wind down, before you marched in and confronted the protestors.REP. ZOE LOFGREN, D-CALIF.: The playbook is to create the impression that there is violence that he must send in federal troops and that's how he hopes to win the election.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: What do you say to that, sir?PENCE: Well, Martha, look, from July 1 forward, the Department of Homeland Security informed me yesterday that we've had 188 federal officials injured by violent protesters in Portland, night after night tearing down the fencing, vandalizing the property, throwing projectiles, you've all seen it. And I think the fact that Jim Jordan stepped forward today and used his time to put those images before the committee and before the American people was a great service.The violence in Portland has got to stop. It is clear that the local leadership and the Mayor of Portland are not willing to step up. That's why we are talking to Governor Kate Brown and the State of Oregon about working in a way forward. Made no mistake about it--MACCALLUM: No.PENCE: --our federal officials are going to have the protection that they need. We're going to protect that federal courthouse. And President Trump has made it clear, we're going to have law and order in our streets.With Joe Biden, the radical Democrats, they want to defund the police. What we are going to do is we're going to fund law enforcement, we're going to stand up for law and order, and that begins right in Portland.MACCALLUM: So the other images that are shown are this wall of moms, wiping tear gas out of their eyes, and we have all seen the image of the navy member who was - they came at him pretty hard and broke his hand. Do you have any regrets about those incidents?PENCE: Well, I regret any time anybody is hurt. But let's be clear, before federal officials moved in a significant way in early July to the federal courthouse in Portland, the Mayor of Portland had said that he had seen a \"month of violence in Portland\". I mean there is nothing to the suggestion that having federal law enforcement officials, marshals, DHS personnel on the ground has had a causative effect here.The reality is that the Mayor of Portland in the local community has simply allowed violent protesters to overrun that community. That community was looking the other way on groups like Antifa a long time ago and now they are paying a price.But what President Trump has made clear, what we've made clear with federal officials as we are saying this far and no farther, we are not only going to protect the federal courthouse and do what it takes to bring our security there.But we're going to make sure that work with the State of Oregon and we reestablish peace on the streets of Portland. The people of that community deserve nothing less. And with this President of this administration, we're going to stand strong with law enforcement and for law and order.MACCALLUM: This head-to-head is clearly going to be a big issue in the election and you see how both sides are characterizing it at this point to their advantage. We'll see what the American people decide they believe in the end and all this.With regard to the election, even a question raised today, two big issues that were raised today, one is the issue of mail-in ballots and here is what Representative Greg Stanton of Arizona said about that today. Watch this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. GREG STANTON, D-ARIZ.: There are fears that you and the President are laying the foundation to interfere with the upcoming election specifically with vote by mail, as my colleagues have previously noted, because both of you have advanced false conspiracy theories about mail-in voting.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: There are so many states in the country that already have mail- in voting, they've had it for a long time. Is there any reason not to accelerate or offer that opportunity to people given the COVID-19 pandemic? Is there anything that's wrong with that in your mind?PENCE: Well Martha look, what we've had in this country for a long time is absentee ballot voting by mail. We've had in the State of Indiana, I've voted in absentee myself since I get this job in Washington D. C.MACCALLUM: Yes, you are right.PENCE: And look, that requires a person request the ballot and then the signature is verified and we protect the vote. The integrity of the vote is paramount. I mean through the generations, Americans have worn the uniform, fought and died to protect all of our freedoms and the right to vote is at the heart of this democracy, and absentee balloting is a time honored tradition.But what you see across this country in Democrat led states is an effort for universal distribution of ballots. Without the accountability that you have with absentee balloting, and when you combine that with states like California that actually allow what is called vote bundling or vote harvesting, you see where the entire ability for widespread fraud is very real.And what you're hearing from President Trump and you will continue to hear from this administration is a commitment to protect the one person, one vote, integrity of our electoral system, and we are going to stand strong on that.MACCALLUM: Let me ask you - I mean I get asked this a lot, do you think it's going - because we will be obviously doing our coverage as usual - do you think it going to be a one night election or you think it's going to go on for weeks, could it go - even go on for a month? Given the situation that we are in with this pandemic, what do you think?PENCE: Well look, I think President Donald Trump is going to be elected for four more years, and I see greater enthusiasm all across this country today.MACCALLUM: But do you think that will happen on November 3?PENCE: As I travel across the country, then I saw four years ago and I think it's going to translate to November 3. But make no mistake about it, the reality of voter fraud is undeniable. We have seen case after case around the country where there have been prosecutions. The president spoke about New Jersey. We've seen it in other states.In my own state of Indiana in 2012, there was a Democrat super PAC that was involved in our elections that literally - there was a group of people that were prosecuted for falsifying ballots. This happens, Martha.And I got to tell you, when you think about the price we have paid for this democracy through the generations, my father wore the uniform in combat, my son is in the Marine Corps, my son-in-law is in the navy, we have to stand for the principle of one person, one vote. And voter integrity is at the heart of what our democracy is all about.MACCALLUM: It sounds like that the possibility is open that it could go on longer if indeed that integrity - you believe that integrity is breached or the President does. So we will stay tuned to see where that goes.I was listening to the former Vice President Joe Biden today and he was speaking about his \"Build Back Better\" plan. One of the things that he mentioned was that he was trying to seek more equity in terms of racial justice and he said that he would be open to the idea of more farmland for black and brown farm owners. Do you think that it is proper to allocate benefits or resources in this country based on the color of people's skin?PENCE: I think under this President, you've seen an agenda that's about advancing the opportunity for every American regardless of racial or creed or color. And Martha, I couldn't be more proud that in our first three years, because this is a President who cut taxes, rolled back regulation, fought for free and fair trade, and supported educational opportunities for every American.We saw the lowest unemployment rate ever recorded for African-Americans, we saw historic investments in black colleges and universities around America. And with Senator Tim Scott, we saw the creation of more than 8,000 opportunity zones in cities that are tracking investments. If Joe Biden and the Democrats want to do something for minority communities, how about - let minority families choose where their children go to school? I mean how about.MACCALLUM: Well, I wanted to ask you about that. But I am going to take that as a no that you are not in favor of the allocation of land based on skin color. You didn't directly answer the questions, but is that accurate, are you not in favor of any program like that?PENCE: Well, honestly I didn't hear what Joe Biden said today and I don't even understand the concept. What we do in this country is we create opportunities for everyone. Joe Biden is denying the ability for African- American families and minority families to choose where their children go to school. He actually wants to defund the school choice program right here in Washington D.C.MACCALLUM: No, we asked his representative about that last night and I think that's going to be a big issue.PENCE: When you talk about building back the economy better, remember this is a President who passed historic tax cuts, rolled back regulation. Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders, their unity agenda of the radical left, they actually want to raise taxes by $4 trillion. They have a $2 trillion Green New Deal program that looks like cylinder (ph) on steroids.I mean look, we're not going to build America back better with more government, higher taxes, more regulation, more liberal policies. We're going to build America back better, stronger and more prosperous by doing again what President Trump and I did in our first three years, and that is less government, less taxes, free and fair trade, educational opportunities for all. That's the way that we can grow this economy and full recovery and then some from this pandemic.MACCALLUM: I only have a few more minutes and I would be remiss if I don't ask you some questions about your COVID-19 meetings today. But I do want to be, since you went there, I would like to ask you about school choice because I was very interested in this particular soundbite from the President on this issue of going back to school. Let's play that.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: If schools do not reopen, the funding should go to parents to send their child to public private charter religious or home school of their choice.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: Now that - I think that caught a lot of people's attention, Vice President. And today, you have the American Federation of Teachers saying that they will back teachers who want to go on strike in this country, as you are under efforts to try to reopen the schools and get kids back in the classroom this fall.So what does that look like? If I'm a parent in America and my school says they are closed, and President Trump says that I can somehow use that money for school choice, that's not on the books right now. What if I really want to make that happen? How can I do that?PENCE: Well, it's one of the reasons why we are demanding that a significant portion of any additional relief funding for education in our states actually go to support school choice programs around the country.But look, Martha, I'm married to a school teacher. She is getting ready to be back in the classroom this fall. We've got to get our kids back to school. Now there's going to be some states and we follow the data on the White House Coronavirus Task Force county by county, city by city. There are going to be some areas that will want to move in a more measured way. We will expect Governors and states as they make those decisions.But look, CDC put out guidance last week that recommended that we get our kids for their academic wellbeing and their health and wellbeing back into the classroom. We know the risk of the coronavirus to healthy children is very low. We know that there are real costs disrupting education for special needs kids, disrupting nutrition. I mean the reality is our kids are going to be better off in school and by working with the states, implementing CDC guidance, we can have.MACCALLUM: But can they - sir, pardon me for interrupting, but can they as the President said, can parents send their children to a public, private, charter, religious or home school or other choice under the current law? Do they have that option?PENCE: Martha, the President said they ought to be able to do that. There's been no greater champion of school choice in the history of this country than President Donald Trump. We're going to continue to stand for and advocate that principle.But right now it's absolutely essential and we are working with every Governor to get our kids back in school. It's best for our kids academically and personally, it's best for working families. And as we open up America, we got to open up America school. And make no mistake about it Martha, as CDC said again last week, as American pediatricians said a couple of weeks ago, we can safely reopen our schools.MACCALLUM: Yes, there's a lot of pushback.PENCE: And at the President's direction, we're going to work our hearts out to get our kids back in the classroom.MACCALLUM: Lot of union organizations, a lot of teachers, a lot of pushback on that. And I know that there's a lot of charter schools and religious schools that would love to have the opportunity to offer those spots to those kids. So that's something we are going to watch personally.Okay, vaccines, some of the sort of reality check on vaccines is that, once they are out there, it's not going to be an instant, everything is better now, everybody gets a vaccine. There is some doctors saying they may work for some people, they might not be a complete umbrella for others. What you can tell us right now about how different it will be at the end of this year or the beginning of next year?PENCE: Well look, just yesterday I was in Florida, the President was in North Carolina. We literally saw in record time the start of Phase Three clinical trials for the first coronavirus vaccine.MACCALLUM: Yes, that's remarkable.PENCE: Now Martha, you understand this. But people need to understand, a vaccine usually takes years to develop, but what President Trump did early on was say, we need to clear away any red tape barriers.He called on our pharmaceutical industry to step up and to accelerate the process without cutting any corners on safety, and now we've got a half a dozen different vaccine platforms that are in development. And I got to tell you, when you got Dr. Fauci saying that it's not if, it's when we have a vaccine, it gives you the signal that we really have great confidence that by this fall, we're going to have a vaccine.And the really exciting thing is under operation warp speed, we are literally producing those vaccines right now. We are purchasing millions of syringes right now, so that the moment that the FDA says that a vaccine is safe and effective, we will have the supplies on hand and literally offer vaccines to tens of millions of Americans and we'll start that process the day that it gets approved.MACCALLUM: Begin mass production. Yes, that is not the way it usually happens. All right, before I let you go, testing, I had a close friend who needed to get a test this week, was told 7-10 days until they would get the results back.I mean by that time anybody that you - if you got it, anybody you came in contact with, I don't know how you are going to contact trace that person - if the wait is too long, everybody says this everywhere you go, when are we going to see a situation where you can either do a home test or you can get a test result back in 24-48 hours at the latest?PENCE: Well, first off, I think the American people should take great pride in the fact that four months ago, we were at a standing start. We had done about 8,000 coronavirus tests. As of today, we have done 55 million coronavirus tests because of the public private partnership that President Trump initiated early on.We are actually doing 800,000 coronavirus tests a day on average. That being said particularly in some hotspot areas, we're dealing with some delays. The average amount of time we are told from the commercial labs which do half of the testing is about four and a half days. It's one of the reasons why the FDA this last weekend approved what's called pooling, Martha. This will allow these commercial labs not just to test one swab at a time, but to test five and ten samples at a time.MACCALLUM: And that hopefully will speed it up?PENCE: And it will speed it up. But also remember, the other half of testing is done very quickly because the half of testing in this country is already being done with point-of-care tests that turn it around in 15 minutes or at hospitals and in-hospital labs. When people are in hospitals, we want to get that test done immediately. We are working with research hospitals around the country to make sure we do it.MACCALLUM: I mean that's great if you can get it, I went all through, I Googled every single place in the entire state of New Jersey and you can't get a rapid test.PENCE: We are making great progress and - one last thing on that Martha, if I may.MACCALLUM: Yes.PENCE: We are also distributing 15,400 Abbott point-of-care 15 minute test to every single nursing home in America.MACCALLUM: Well, that's important. That's very important. We talked about that a lot here.PENCE: 600 last week and 600 this week, and in the next four weeks or so, every nursing home in America will have a 15 minute test to be able to test residents and faculty. And we hope very soon when it's approved visitors visiting loved ones.MACCALLUM: All right. I got to jump out there or I'm going to get cut off. Vice President Mike Pence, thank you very much sir, great to have you with us.PENCE: Good to be with you, Martha.MACCALLUM: So coming up next, we will talk to Congressman Eric Swalwell. He was one of the Democrats who was there questioning Bill Barr today. Then Guy Benson will follow-up after that when we get back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)MACCALLUM: It was a raucous hearing in there today as members of the Judiciary Committee grilled the Attorney General on everything from the riots in Portland to healthcare and everything in between. Here's some of the exchange today between Congressman Swalwell and Attorney General William Barr.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. ERIC SWALWELL, D-CALIF: So, how can you sit here and tell us why should I investigate the President of the United States, if you are not even aware of the facts concerning the President using the pardon or commutation power to swap the silence of a witness?BARR: Because we require a reliable predicate before we open a criminal investigation.SWALWELL: And I just gave to you sir.BARR: I don't consider it. I consider it a very Rube Goldberg theory that you have.SWALWELL: Well, it sounds like you're hearing this first time today.BARR: And by the way, if I apply history, there will be a lot more people under investigation.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: Congressman Eric Swalwell, welcome, good to have you here tonight.SWALWELL: Thanks Martha.MACCALLUM: So, we played a lot of clips from what we watched, I watched a lot of it straight through today and I was just struck by the question of how that's a fair process when someone is brought into that room and then for the most part - I mean actually you allowed him to answer questions I think more than most of your colleagues, who wouldn't even let him breathe and answer, how is that a fair process?SWALWELL: Well, the Attorney General doesn't need an ice-cream cone before he sits down to answer questions, Martha.MACCALLUM: No, but he needs to be allowed to answer the question.SWALWELL: He's a big boy, he answered the questions. I wanted to point out that you can only have a corrupt President if you have an Attorney General who would enable it, and he acknowledged that only once in his memory did he intervene to help somebody get a reduced sentence and that was the President's friend. And I thought that exchange was productive, he got to say what he wanted to say, and I got to make the point I wanted to make.MACCALLUM: Well, and his point was that he didn't believe that there was anything wrong with the process that he carried out. You made your point as you say and he made his. But I mean, the idea that to suggest that he is a big boy and doesn't need an ice cream cone, people wouldn't let him answer a single question. They kept saying, give me back my time, give me back my time.So here is my question, your committee has wanted him to come in here for a long time, right. I think myself and a lot of other Americans wanted to see the exchange, because you have - oh many of you have accused him of sort of being a side lamp to the President acting on his behalf.This was a golden opportunity for the country to hear what his answer was and they didn't get to hear what his answer was, and I'm wondering if there was a fear that if he was given that opportunity, then he might be persuasive to some people.SWALWELL: Well, I was concerned by what we did here. He said that he's talking to the President about his reelection campaign. I don't want an independent prosecutor doing that.MACCALLUM: He said, of course it comes up, I'm in the cabinet, I'm not going to sit here and lie to you and tell you that it's never come up in a cabinet meeting. He was being extra careful.SWALWELL: He also implied that there may be some foreign interference, that's okay, which again we don't want the top national security lawyer to say that.MACCALLUM: Let me just play an example of this, Eric.SWALWELL: And Martha, he co-signed on the President's theory that has been debunked by everyone that mail-in balloting is fraudulent. But go ahead, play your clip.MACCALLUM: All right. Let's watch some of what happened, go ahead.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. PRAMILA JAYAPAL, D-WA.: When protesters with guns and swap.BARR: I am aware of protesters in the federal government.JAYAPAL: Excuse me, Mr. Barr, this is my time and I control it.BARR: I have already explained that it had been planned all day.JAYAPAL: Attorney General, the time is mine. We've waited a long time for you to come here, the time is mine.BARR: You waited to talk to me like this? You didn't need to wait for so long.It is not a self defining terms as they - that they recognize.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You've only got two minutes sir. Mr. Barr, if I may?BARR: Yes, but this is a hearing. I thought I was the one that was supposed to be heard.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: Good question. I mean you could have just propped up a picture of him and yelled at it.SWALWELL: I don't think he's as weak as you were describing him.MACCALLUM: I am not suggesting he's weak at all, I'm suggesting that you were sitting - you brought him in there to answer questions and then you didn't give him a chance to answer them. I know it doesn't matter what side of the fence you are on, anybody can watch that process and say it was not a hearing - that was not a hearing.SWALWELL: I thought it was also an important point that it seems like they are selectively using the police, and I think Joe Biden said it best today. We should prosecute anarchists and people who are burning buildings.However, when you are only sending the troops in to protect the courthouses while armed protesters are going to Michigan, they are going to Wisconsin, and they are in militia gear, they are carrying their assault weapons and they are threatening to kill the governors there, why aren't you sending in the troops there? Instead, he is suing the governors for having stayaway orders that for people to be safe during COVID. So I think that was a productive exchange as well.MACCALLUM: Okay. Here he is answering that question about burning down a federal courthouse. Watch this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BARR: Federal courts are under attack. Since when is it okay to try to burn down a federal court? The U.S. Marshals have a duty to stop that and defend the courthouse, and that's what we are doing in Portland. We are at the courthouse defending the courthouse. We are not out looking for trouble.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: Do you believe that when people are bending down the fence in front of the courthouse and breaking it and trying to get through to attack the courthouse itself that that's a problem and that Federal Marshals need to protect it?SWALWELL: Yes. I believe you can arrest people who are trying to burn down the courthouse and not dust a mom, use violence against an unarmed veteran or shoot projectiles against an unarmed individual who are still in the hospital today. I think you can do both and I think they are just making the situation worse.MACCALLUM: Well, there are some investigations with regard to the specific situation that you talked about. I just asked the vice president about that as well. Because I think that everybody, you know, wants situations to be fair on the ground and we don't want peaceful protesters to be hurt in any way.Eric Swalwell, thank you. Good to see you today.SWALWELL: My pleasure. Thanks.MACCALLUM: Guy Benson is here, hot of the Guy Benson show, a Fox News contributor and author of \"End of Discussion.\" Talk about \"End of Discussion,\" Guy, I mean, there was no discussion in there. I think that no matter what side of the fence you are on, anybody who watch that had to be a little frustrated.GUY BENSON, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, Martha, you said that you watch it for hours on end.MACCALLUM: I did.BENSON: I made it about 90 minutes. I think we are both masochists watching that spectacle just down the street from me here in Washington.I mean, you're right, they should have perhaps maybe bought a cardboard cutout of Bill Barr, they could have sat him in that chair and they have screamed at him for increments of five minutes and maybe, I don't know, thrown some rotten fruit or something and pounded the dust because but most of the Democrats on that dais clearly had absolutely no interest whatsoever in gleaning any information from the attorney general.They wanted to vent at him and they did, and it was frankly embarrassing and sort of painful to watch.MACCALLUM: Well, Bill Barr is a very smart man. And whether you like him or you don't like him, or whether you think he is, you know, too cozy with the president, whatever you think.He, if they had given him a chance, the likelihood that he was going to give them answers that might cause some people to pause, and think maybe, you know, and kind of understand his line of thinking was pretty good.BENSON: Yes.MACCALLUM: So, you know, do you think that that was part of the issue that they didn't want to give him that oxygen, or, you know, why --BENSON: Bingo.MACCALLUM: -- why would they -- what else would be the motivation for the way this --(CROSSTALK)BENSON: No, I think -- I think you nailed it. So, if people want to see something worthwhile from the hearing I encourage them to go watch the opening statement from the attorney general which was interrupted, the only uninterrupted really portion of the entire event for the attorney general.Smart, thoughtful, measured nuance. And I think that you're right, Martha. I think for a lot of these Democrats, they had a bunch of talking points and attacks they wanted to get out, they had limited time and Barr, let's be frank, I think is a much smarter man than many of the people up there and maybe on both sides of the aisle. He's a very bright individual. He also has command of the facts.So, they wanted to throw out and hurl allegations his way where he has answers. They, I think deep down know he has some good responses that might, God forbid, be persuasive and compelling to viewers at home so they wouldn't let him a word in edgewise. And the result, again, I think was humiliating for them and not edifying to the home viewers certainly unless you're a hard-core resistance person, in which case you probably love that theater.MACCALLUM: Might have loved it. And if that's the case then you also love it when he asked can we please have a five-minute break and was told by Chairman Nadler no.BENSON: No. He said no to a bathroom break.MACCALLUM: No. No. You cannot have a five-minute break. And they said, all right, you can have a five-minute break. He's like the mean teacher.Thank you very much, Guy. Good to see as always.BENSON: Martha, am I allowed to go? Can I take a break because I'm --(CROSSTALK)LEMON: Yes, you may take a break BENSON: All right.MACCALLUM: You may take a break. Everyone can take a break. We're going to have a commercial in a moment.The mayor of Portland, Oregon, demanding that the president pull his federal troops out of the city, as he puts it. But local business owners may feel a little bit differently. We're going to talk to one of them coming up next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)MACCALLUM: The scenes out of Portland are difficult to watch especially for the people whose livelihoods are on the line in that area. The business owners they've watch so much of what they have worked for in some cases smashed to pieces, their windows are broken, their buildings burned to the ground in some cases. The mayor of Portland blames the president for escalating the violence.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MAYOR TED WHEELER, D-PORTLAND: If we are not able to get the federal administration to back off and leave our city it will happen all across the United States jeopardizing the United States Constitution.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: All right. Ted Wheeler says it's all Washington's fault what is happening in Portland right now.Joining me now, James Louie, owner of Huber's Cafe in downtown Portland, a restaurant that has been in business since 1879. Mr. Louie, thank you very much for being here. What is your take on what's going on in Portland and what's happening to the businesses like yours?JAMES LOUIE, OWNER, HUBER'S CAFE: Well, between the COVID-19 pandemic and the black lives demonstrations, it's really damaging to business in general. Our business and businesses in downtown Portland, people don't want to come downtown.I mean, the Oregon health authority, they say stay home and save lives. And then of course people don't want to come downtown because of the protests, even though the violent protests are happening at the justice center and that's five blocks away from us.But people are concerned about getting caught up in the protest march or people are concerned about having their vehicle vandalized and so people don't want to come downtown. It's a, like you say, it's a lot of restaurants. A lot of businesses have closed because of those reasons.MACCALLUM: It's really sad what we've seen in Portland and so many places across the country. What -- do you agree with the Mayor, Ted Wheeler, who says, you know, that this is really the fault of these federal agents that came to the area to protect that federal court building?LOUIE: Well, it does seem like it has created a reaction. When you think about the population of Portland, Oregon, 600,000, and you have maybe 1,000, maybe 2,000 people demonstrating down at the courthouse. It's the most, a small segment of the population. And mainstream Americans who live here in Portland, Oregon, we'd like to see the vandalism, the violence to stop and we'd like things to go back to normal.MACCALLUM: I don't blame you. I don't blame you, Mr. Louie and your business one that I know you take great pride in, it's been in the city for a very long time. And whatever it takes we all want to see the situation righted and we want to see people be able to go out, back out to dinner and back out to work and we wish you all the best.James Louie, thank you very much for sharing your perspective with us tonight. We appreciate it, sir.LOUIE; Well, it was my pleasure. Thank you for having me on.MACCALLUM: Thank you very much.Coming up next, we're going to talk to General Jack Keane on the Trump administration's dramatic shift towards China, when we come back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)MACCALLUM: Tonight, where are the United States and China headed? you've got tensions escalating between the White House and leadership in Beijing drawing comparisons to the world dynamic before World War II.In a new op-ed Ian Haworth at the Daily Wire suggests China is our generation's Nazi, Germany. And Asia analyst, Gordon Chang is now comparing China under Xi Jinping to Japan under Emperor Hirohito in the 1930s.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GORDON CHANG, AUTHOR, THE COMING COLLAPSE OF CHINA: Two thousand eighteen, for instance, they lasered a U.S. C-130 in Djibouti. When you try to blind the pilots of an American plane, you're trying to bring it down and kill the crew.There have been the sonic attacks against U.S. diplomats of the Guangzhou consulate at about the same time causing brain injuries. We've seen all sorts of incidents around China's periphery. You know, it's very new in a sense, but it's also very old. This is 1930s Japan.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: Fascinating. Here now, General Jack Keane, chairman of the Institute for the Study of War and a Fox News senior strategic analyst. General, always good to see you. Thank you for being here tonight.I know that you say that we are seeing a true strategic shift in our relationship in China and the perspective of this administration. And do you see the threat that China poses as similar to those powers before World War II?JACK KEANE, FOX NEWS SENIOR STRATEGIC ANALYST: Yes. Similar in terms of what they are trying to achieve. I mean, President Xi has told us in a way that no previous Chinese administration have said, that he wants to achieve the so-called China dream, which is domination and control of the Asia- pacific region and replace United States as a global power in the world. He believes the United States is a declining power and they are rising power.And what he doesn't say but he clearly is trying to achieve and that is replacing international order that has sustained a general sense of world stability since post-World War II in a sense that we haven't had another epic war among major powers.He wants that to go away and achieve that kind of influence that he has. And I believe, the other thing, Martha, I think he's buoyed by a number of things, a very strong economy that his predecessor did not have. And he has a growing dominating military by comparison to the United States and it gives him enormous confidence.And I believe he's put his ambitions on a fast track. I think he's got the hard liners in his country behind him, the moderates and others I think have serious reservations about what he is doing.And yes, we are in a major strategic shift. What really the catalyst for it was growing a local regionalized epidemic in his own country in a particular province that he -- where he protected the rest of his country particularly his power centers in Beijing and Shanghai but let it spread through international flights to the world writ large.MACCALLUM: Yes.KEANE: That and crushing the autonomy of Hong Kong has had -- the world has looked at this and that is causing the strategic shift much sooner than we thought. And the United States, I give this administration some credit for stepping up and exercising a leadership role and trying to bring together a broad coalition and fashion a strategy to deal with the reality of the Chinese Communist Party and its very serious ambitions.MACCALLUM: Here's Steve Bannon on that coalition idea. Watch this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)STEVE BANNON, FORMER WHITE HOUSE ADVISOR: Developed into an alliance of liberty bringing in the United Kingdom, India, and Japan. Used Hong Kong as the Annville and the U.S. dollar as the hammer, it's time now to take the fight directly financially to the Chinese Communist Party.General Secretary Xi is defiling in the gun sites. I think he should be sanctioned personally. His henchmen around hm should be sanctioned personally. We should start to seize all their assets in the United States and London.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: In its discussion about this alignment of the United Kingdom, Australia which Secretary Pompeo talked about, Japan, India. And then on the other side, of course, you have China, Iran, Russia with aligned interest there as well which I think, you know, does remind a lot of people at the kind of alignments that we saw in World War II.KEANE: Yes, certainly. I mean, these are very strong democracies that are being threatened because if Xi is able to achieve what he's talking about, that challenges the sovereignty of all of our democratic states and that is what is unifying us as it did during World War II and as it did post-World War II dealing with the existential threat of the Soviet Union.Now we don't have hundreds of thousands of troops facing each other in Europe like we did post-World War II. We don't have thousands of missiles facing each other as we did then with large air forces also in place ready to go.But make no mistake here. The ambitions that President Xi has are every bit as serious as what the Soviet Union had and the Nazis and imperialistic Japan.MACCALLUM: Yes.KEANE: And why we deal with this, we don't have to lose control, we don't have to lose our sense of rationality here, we don't have to over react, but we do have to act. And we have to act sensibly with good sound judgment and do it in concert with our allies.The world has been here before dealing with thugs like this and we can deal with them. And putting together a plan to do it in terms of a strategy and also a coalition I think is the right answer and it should transcend administrations because this is going to take some time.MACCALLUM: Well, that's going to be a big question in terms of this election and how a continuing President Trump or a new president in the form of Vice President Biden would face this threat, which I think the history books will trace back to the COVID pandemic and how it altered the dynamic in many ways in the world because they put the trade deal on the back burner and change things overall in terms of the strategy.General Jack Keane, thank you, sir. Always good to see you.KEANE: Good talking to you, Martha.MACCALLUM: Have a good night. You too.All right, everybody. It is July and a great white shark attack has now just happened for the first time ever in Maine as a fatal attack. It killed a swimmer off the coast, as we start to see more sharks in these areas up the New England coast.A senior shark scientist, one of the world-renowned people on this issue is with me after the break. Stay tuned.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)MACCALLUM: Be vigilant, that is the warning from authorities in Maine tonight who say that a 63-year-old woman was attacked and killed by a great white shark while swimming just off the shore, 30 to 40 feet from the beach off of Bailey Island in Casco Bay.The cause of death was confirmed by a tooth fragment that was left behind by the shark and while this is Maine's first ever deadly shark attack, officials say that they have seen an increase in shark sightings off the New England coast over recent years.New York City resident Julie Holowach was attacked on Monday afternoon, just yesterday, while she was swimming about 20 yards off of the shore.Joining me now, Dr. Gregory Skomal, shark scientist who had shark research and serves as senior fisheries biologist for the Massachusetts division of marine fisheries.Dr. Skomal, thank you for being here. We've spoken before about this and as we said, this is the first time that we have seen something like this in Maine. And I'm going to show the maps in just a moment. But what's your reaction to this horrible attack?GREGORY SKOMAL, SHARK SCIENTIST: well, anytime a person that has bitten by a shark and in this case, it's fatal, you know, it's a tragedy. It's horrendous and it's devastating. You know, I don't -- I've been studying sharks for many, many years and I don't like to see these kinds of events happened whatsoever.MACCALLUM: So, I'm going to put up the Sharktivity app that shows a lot of concentration near where I spend a lot of time in Chatham, Massachusetts. It's hard to see at home I know, but the collection of blue dots that you see at the bottom of your screen, that's Cape Cod and we see lots of great white sharks in that area, we've seen them for many years there.But, Greg, at the very top of this map of New England all the way up there is that shark up in Casco. So why do you -- why do you think we're seeing this migration of them up the coast now.SKOMAL: I think it's important for people to realize, Martha, that the Gulf of Maine, the coast of Maine all the way to Canada, these are areas that white sharks have been going to for hundreds if not thousands of years, so this is not a new phenomenon.What is happening though is we're seeing the restoration of shark populations, namely the great white shark, in addition to the restoration of seal populations. And what basic equation is simple. White sharks consume seals. So, the more seals that are occurring along the coastline including the coast of Maine, the more likely we'll see white sharks in those areas attempting to feed on those seals.MACCALLUM: So, we saw one fatal attack I believe it was two years ago now, Labor Day on the Cape. And now, this woman, sadly, in Maine. Is there -- is it that people are swimming too close to these seals, I mean, why are we starting to see this? And they are so close to shore.SKOMAL: Well, I think it's really important though to put it in the context of risk. I mean, if you look at the statistics the probability of being bitten by a shark still remains remarkably low. But nonetheless, any kind of incident of this nature is absolutely horrible.What's happening is as these sharks come back to these areas where they traditionally have fed on seals, we have overlap with human activities and a lot of human activities, particularly days like today. I mean, these are really, you know, hot days and people are getting on and in the water, and they're going into this area where white sharks. This predator-prey relationship is happening.MACCALLUM: Yes. Dr. Greg Skomal, one of the foremost experts on great white sharks, we appreciate you being here and our thoughts go out to Julie's family. It's a terrible tragedy on a beautiful summer day with her family swimming in the water in Maine.Thanks for being here tonight, everybody. That's \"The Story.\" We'll be back with more tomorrow night as \"The Story\" goes on. We'll see you here. Tucker Carlson is coming up next from Washington, D.C. Have a great night. It's a good one.

Thank you for joining us. Welcome to \"Sunday Morning Futures.\" I'm Maria Bartiromo. Crime, coronavirus and China dominating the headlines this morning, as Congress scrambles to hammer out the next federal stimulus package before millions of Americans lose their extra unemployment benefits at the end of the month, all this against the backdrop of the 2020 election now just 99 days away. President Trump canceling all GOP events in Jacksonville, while asserting himself as the law and order candidate, dispatching officers to Portland, as well as more force in Seattle and Chicago. Just ahead, acting Secretary of Homeland Security Chad Wolf is here to tell us what the federal government is doing to restore safety to our nation's cities, as protesters target his own home. This as newly declassified documents reveal the FBI used counterintelligence briefings as a cover-up to investigate the Trump campaign. Senator Lindsey Graham is here with the very latest on his Russia deep dive, as he prepares to grill former Attorney General -- assistant General Sally Yates before the committee on Wednesday. We're joined this morning by Congressman Devin Nunes with more breaking news on the Steele dossier. He will reveal it right here for the very first time coming up. And in the middle of all of this, Beijing busted this week for spying on U.S. soil, after three Chinese nationals were arrested trying to steal medical research, a concern you heard here from Senator Tom Cotton, flagging this on this program in April. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. TOM COTTON (R-AR): I have little doubt that the Chinese intelligence services are actively trying to steal America's intellectual property as it relates to the virus that they unleashed on the world, because, of course, they want to be the country that claims credit for finding those drugs or finding a vaccine, and then use it as leverage against the rest of the world. (END VIDEO CLIP) BARTIROMO: Global investor Ray Dalio is back with us today with his assessment of the China threat and why it hasn't stopped him and others from investing there. All that and a lot more, as we look ahead today on \"Sunday Morning Futures.\" But, first, new revelations this week about Christopher Steele and his bogus dossier paid for by Hillary Clinton's campaign and the Democratic National Committee. Newly declassified documents providing even more evidence that the FBI knew that there was no collusion as early as January of 2017, but they kept investigating Trump and his campaign anyway and renewing warrants to do so. This just the latest domino to fall, with more bombshell documents expected any day now. White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows breaking that news right here with us right here last week. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MARK MEADOWS, WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF: We know that they not only knew that there wasn't a case, but they continued to investigate and spy -- and, yes, I use the word spy -- on Trump campaign officials, and, actually, even doing things when this president was sworn in, and after that, and doing it in an inappropriate manner. You're going to see a couple of other documents come out in the coming days that will suggest that, not only was the campaign spied on, but the FBI did not act appropriately as they were investigating. It's all starting to come unravel -- to unravel. And I tell you, it's time that people go to jail and people are indicted. (END VIDEO CLIP) BARTIROMO: Joining me right now to talk more about that is Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham. Mr. Chairman, it's great to have you once again. Thank you so much for being here. SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-SC): Thank you. BARTIROMO: A big applaud goes to you for declassifying documents over the last week and really getting to the news and the truth. Thank you, Senator, for doing that. I know that our audience is grateful. GRAHAM: Thank you. BARTIROMO: I want to talk about what you declassified. And, certainly, you have articles in this from The New York Times, where we see Peter Strzok, FBI agent... GRAHAM: Right. BARTIROMO: ... marking off the articles, saying there is absolutely no evidence of this. Tell us about the report that you declassified from the FBI which is based on an interview with the subsource of Christopher Steele. GRAHAM: So, there's two things that we declassified so the public could understand how corrupt Crossfire Hurricane actually was. Number one was a memo written by an intel analyst who spent three days interviewing the Russian subsource. I don't know about you, but I always thought the Russian subsource was somebody based in Russia in the bowels of the Russian government risking their lives, trying to get information out to the Democratic Party. The Russian subsource, we now know, was on the payroll of Christopher Steele. And he also had a working relationship with the Brookings Institute. And we have learned from the memo that we declassified that the Russian subsource, who was American-based, not Russian-based, told Christopher Steele: Here's what I have got. It is bar talk. It's rumor. It is innuendo. It is not really reliable. And what did Christopher Steele do with that? He turned it into a Tom Clancy novel. He sold it to the FBI. They sold it to the FISA court to get a warrant against Carter Page. And what does this memo show? Then, in January 2017, when they found the Russian subsource, who was in the United States, he disavowed the dossier as being reliable. The FBI knew it, did a 40-page memo. But the FBI continued to lie to the court, getting new warrants based on the dossier in April and June of 2017. After they knew it was a bunch of garbage, they continued to use it anyway. Somebody needs to go to jail. BARTIROMO: So, tell me about the criminality, because... GRAHAM: Yes. BARTIROMO: ... if that subsource told the FBI agent, this is all bar talk... GRAHAM: Right. BARTIROMO: ... this is all hearsay... GRAHAM: Yes. BARTIROMO: ... why didn't the FBI stop renewing warrants to spy on Carter Page? GRAHAM: That is the central accusation that I'm trying to find out. I'm doing oversight. Durham is doing a criminal investigation. Here is what I can tell you, that Peter Strzok new that the subsource was not reliable. In the notes that we declassified where Strzok is commenting on the February 14 New York Times article, he indicates in there that Steele does not have insight into the reliability of the subsource. So, that tells me that Strzok knew about the interview with the subsource in January, where the subsource says it is all bar talk and hearsay. So, Strzok has a duty to report to the court exculpatory information. He has a duty to notify his superiors that the key document to get a warrant against Carter Page, the Russian dossier, is no longer reliable. I find it impossible to believe that McCabe and Comey were not made aware of this 40-page memo. Think about it for the moment. What's the odds that somebody would go to the trouble of writing a 40-page memo, shredding the reliability of the Russian dossier, and not tell other people in the FBI about it? I think there's zero chance that happened. And anybody that knew that the Russian dossier was unreliable and continued to get a warrant against Carter Page based on that document should go to jail for defrauding the court. BARTIROMO: So, you are calling witnesses down to get interviewed in front of your committee. GRAHAM: Yes. BARTIROMO: You have got Sally Yates coming soon. GRAHAM: Yes. Right. BARTIROMO: Are you going to call Jim Comey and Andrew McCabe? GRAHAM: Yes, absolutely, at the end. But I want to call Sally Yates. But let me tell you who I want to call for sure, is, I want to call the person who prepared the memo. I want to call the case agent who interviewed the subsource for three days in January and ask him, oh, by the way, did you tell anybody above you that the dossier is a piece of Russian disinformation? They're laughing their ass off in Russia. This New York Times article that somehow the subsource has been compromised, nobody in Russia is mad at this subsource who is U.S.-based, because the subsource took a bunch of Russian disinformation, sold it to Christopher Steele, who sold it to the FBI. What happened here is that Russian disinformation was used by American law enforcement in weapons form to go after a sitting president. They're laughing their ass off in Russia about this. They would give this guy a medal. BARTIROMO: Mm-hmm. So, tell me about the Sally Yates interview. That is happening on August 5. GRAHAM: OK. Right. Right. BARTIROMO: That is coming up. What do you want to find out from Sally Yates? GRAHAM: Three things. Three things. Ms. Yates has previously testified that she met with President Obama and Vice President Biden, I think it was Comey and Brennan and a few others, to talk about the ongoing surveillance of General Flynn, who was the incoming national security adviser. At that meeting, she learned for the first time -- and she is number two at the Justice Department on January the 5th, 2017 -- that the FBI was surveilling General Flynn. What shocked her the most is that Obama knew about it, and she didn't. Now, what do I want to ask her? I want her explain to us, how is it possible the president of the United States knows about a surveillance of the incoming national security adviser, General Flynn, and you didn't? And did she hear Vice President Biden mention whether or not Flynn may have violated the Logan Act? And I want to under -- I want her to explain to us what kind of system is in place? On January the 4th, the FBI agents in the field recommended dropping General Flynn from Crossfire Hurricane because there was no there there. So, really, what I want to hear from Flynn is, how could Obama know and she didn't? And did Biden mention that we should be looking at Flynn in terms after a Logan Act violation? If he said that, that is contrary to what he has been saying publicly. BARTIROMO: Well, what did they also say -- what did the FBI say to Congress? Because I remember John Brennan being interviewed... GRAHAM: Stay tuned. (LAUGHTER) BARTIROMO: ... in testimony to -- in front of Trey Gowdy. GRAHAM: Yes. Yes. BARTIROMO: And he said to Trey Gowdy, we did not use the dossier. It was a small part of the overall mosaic. GRAHAM: Right. BARTIROMO: What about the FBI and what it told Congress? Is lying to Congress a 10-year felony, as Trey Gowdy has said on this program? GRAHAM: So, stay tuned. Next week, you are going to learn more. Not only do we now know that the FBI lied to the FISA court about the reliability of the dossier. They told the court that the subsource was truthful and cooperative and Russian- based. The truth of the matter is that the subsource was American-based. He was an employee of Christopher Steele, who was on the payroll of the Democratic Party. And he told Christopher Steele, this is all a bunch of hearsay. And when the FBI understood that the dossier was no longer reliable, they continued to use it. But we also now have found -- and this will come out next week -- that Congress got suspicious about the Russian subsource and the reliability of the Steele dossier and that members of Congress asked to be briefed about it. I will tell you next week what I found. And here is what I think I'm going to be able to show to the public. Not only did the FBI lie to the court about the reliability of the Steele dossier. They also relied -- lied to the Congress. And that is a separate crime. BARTIROMO: So, that is a second criminal -- that is a second criminal act, then? GRAHAM: And this is in 2018. So, again, I want to emphasize this, that the Congress got suspicious, the Intelligence Committee did, about Steele and the reliability of the dossier. The intelligence community did not want to include the dossier in the intelligence assessment provided to President Trump about the 2016 campaign because they didn't trust it. So, they started asking questions at the FBI in 2018 about the subsource and how reliable this information was. And I found the notes that the FBI used to prepare that briefing. Mr. Horowitz told us about them. I found them. Stay tuned next week. You're going to find, not only did the FBI lie to the FISA court. They lied their ass off to the Congress. BARTIROMO: Unbelievable. This is more breaking news. We will follow your reporting next week, Senator. (LAUGHTER) BARTIROMO: Real quick, before you go, you have been knee-deep on working on another package for the shutdown and the coronavirus response. GRAHAM: Yes. Right. BARTIROMO: Are we going to see you pass something before the Senate leaves on August 8? What is the conversation now about those unemployment benefits, which will go away on July 31? GRAHAM: Well, here's the problem we have. Seventy percent of the people, almost, on unemployment are making more unemployed than they did when they worked. We need to change that. State benefits are trying to replace 50 percent of lost wages. What Mnuchin wants to do is have a federal benefit to take it up to 70 percent. Our goal is to give you 70 percent of the money you lost by being employed, not to give you a pay raise in unemployment. We have got to fix that. We have got to take care of kids. We have got $100 billion in this package to safely get kids back to school. And hospitals are beginning to be overrun again by new admissions. So we have got money to help our health care system. Half the Republicans are going to vote no to any phase four package. That's just a fact. And a lot of Democrats are going to insist on $3 trillion, which would be way too much. It would be wasted money. I'm confident that President Trump will lead us to a solution where we have money for kids, jobs, and health care. We need to stimulate the economy. We need a phase four. And I think we will come together before August the 5th to get this done. BARTIROMO: All right, we will leave it there. We will be watching. Lindsey Graham, thanks for your leadership in all of this. We appreciate your time this morning, sir. Thank you. GRAHAM: Thank you. BARTIROMO: Senator Lindsey Graham joining us there. A quick break, and then coming up, acting Secretary of Homeland Security Chad Wolf is here live on what the federal government is doing to do to restore law and order across our country, with some mayors saying they're just not welcome. Back in a minute. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Crime and vandalism besieging downtown Portland overnight, as the city enters a 60th straight day of often violent protests over the death of George Floyd. President Trump deployed federal officers there to restore law and order, facing opposition from local lawmakers who are demanding they leave. Acting Secretary of Homeland Security Chad Wolf has been leading the federal response in Portland. He joins me right now. And, Secretary, it is great to have you this morning. Thank you so much for joining us. And, certainly, your leadership on all of this is critical. Please explain to us the difference in terms of what is happening in Portland vs. the response to other cities across our country where there is also crime and vandalism and in need of law and order? CHAD WOLF, ACTING U.S. SECRETARY OF HOMELAND SECURITY: Well, thanks for having me on this morning, Maria. What's going on in Portland is very different than any other city across our country today. What we have in Portland is, every night, again, between midnight and 5:00 a.m., you have anywhere from 2,000, 3,000, upwards to 4,000 violent individuals targeting federal property, the federal courthouse there in Portland and federal law enforcement officers. They are arriving every night, using city streets and city parks. They're coming armed with rocks, bottles, basketball bats, power tools, commercial- grade fireworks, eliciting that violence, and targeting their violence on federal courthouse and federal law enforcement officers. That is very different than what is going on in Chicago -- places like Chicago, Albuquerque, Kansas City. That is where you see normal criminal activity, street crime, what we say, regarding gangs and drug dealers. And, again, President Trump and the administration, led by the Department of Justice, is targeting that type of crime. But, again, Portland is very different. What we see in Portland is a city, at least at certain hours of the night, completely out of control. We see city leadership there has fostered an environment that allows these criminals to do this throughout the night, untouched, absolutely untouched. It is time for Portland to join other responsible cities around this country, working with federal law enforcement, to address this violence. Just last night, Maria, we had protests across the country. We had some violent protests taking place in Seattle, in Oakland, in other cities. But what we saw there is, we saw local and state, federal law enforcement -- working with federal law enforcement, addressing those issues, without major incidents. We need Portland to step up to the plate, do their responsibility, and work with us to address violent criminal activity occurring every night. BARTIROMO: Well, what if they don't, Secretary? Something has got to give, right? This is going on every night that Portland looks like Baghdad. And they are pushing back on officers. These people can go all the way up to the fence and the perimeter and throw bricks at officers. What are you going to do about it? WOLF: Absolutely. Well, I will say that we're working very, very closely with the Department of Justice, the FBI, as well as others. And I will say that we are going to have additional actions probably as early as this week. We cannot continue to let law enforcement officers targeted and injured night after night after night. And I just want to say, we often hear from, again, city leaders and even other leaders, Oregon senators, who say there is not a lot of violence going on, it is mainly peaceful protesting. I would say to you, that we have over 70 arrests. We have over 188 individual injuries. We have got over a dozen times it has been declared a riot that says otherwise. This is violent, violent activity. We have got dozens of pictures, photos, videos, some of which we released, that say the complete opposite. So, I think it is very important that Americans and your viewers understand what is going on in Portland. It is violent crime every single night. And, again, I'm asking the city, the state to step up, do their job, work with federal law enforcement, and let's bring this to a peaceful conclusion. BARTIROMO: Yes. WOLF: And let me just end by saying the department strongly supports individuals who want to peacefully protest. You want to exercise your First Amendment right, there is no concern. In fact, that happens in Portland every day. There's no incidents. There's no arrests. And we're fine. It is this violent criminal activity that has to stop. BARTIROMO: Yes. And you may actually have two of your agents permanently blind, God forbid, because they were -- they had lasers shined in their eyes. I want to take short break and come back and talk about that, as well as a protest planned right outside of your house. Stay with us. More with Secretary Chad Wolf when we come right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BARTIROMO: Welcome back. We are back live with acting Secretary of Homeland Security Chad Wolf. Secretary, we were just going through the situation in Portland. I want to get to the other major cities in our country and the violence happening there. But why can't -- before we finish on Portland, why can't you just arrest the leadership in Portland because of their ignoring what is really happening on the ground? WOLF: Well, we absolutely are doing that. So, we're working with the FBI there in Portland, with the U.S. attorney's office there in Portland, to address the leaders that are organizing this and then going after them. We're also making arrests every night. We made more than seven or eight arrests last night. And we will continue to do that. We're continuing to hold these criminals accountable. If the city won't, the federal government will hold these folks accountable. And I think it is interesting. I have often been asked by a number of city officials, as well as, again, senators, who say, just have DHS officers stay on federal property. If you stay on federal property, all will be fine. We did that Friday night, Maria, and over seven officers were injured on federal property. So, this has nothing to do with, you stay on federal property, and then we will peacefully protest. That is not the case. We know what their aim is. Their aim is to destroy that courthouse and injure law enforcement officers. We have them on video as saying that. We know what their goal is. And we're going to continue to protect and do our job. BARTIROMO: Right. How are your officers doing, your agents doing who are -- have lost eyesight because of the lasers shone at their eyes? WOLF: Yes, well, I appreciate you mentioning that. We have two to three different officers. We are waiting on final results to see how much their eyesight will permanently be lost because of the activity of these criminals. As you indicated, they are shining lasers, high, powerful lasers into officers' eyes as they emerge from the courthouse. So, we're taking steps, we have taken steps to address that. And we will continue to protect our officers at all costs. And, again, all I need is the city of Portland to step up and do their job. These individuals are on city streets. They're in city parks, arming themselves every night. And the city simply does nothing about it, absolutely nothing. BARTIROMO: Unbelievable. WOLF: It is irresponsible, and it is very dangerous. BARTIROMO: And right now, there are plans for a protest right outside of your home. What are you doing? What can you tell us about this other protest which is really trying to single-handedly attack you? WOLF: Well, what I can tell you, Maria, is, our officers in Portland every night are targeted. Their personal information is on the Internet, put out there by these criminals, by these anarchists. They're identified. Their families are harassed. They go where they're staying. The doxing is prolific. And we're trying to address that. And, of course, we see them trying to do that to myself. We will continue to do our job. We are not going to be deterred by this. This is tactic they have used for over three years, three-and-a-half years. We know what it is. We're prepared for it. At the end of the day, we're going to do our job, we're going to do our mission. The American people deserve that. And, again, I go back to the -- most reasonable Americans understand what is at play in Portland, understand what the department is doing, what the president is doing and what the administration is doing. And that is, we are standing up for law and order. And anyone who says otherwise is not being accurate. And I will say that the other -- the other side that wants to criticize law enforcement, what they don't do, they do not condemn these acts of violence in Portland. I have talked with a number of Democratic members of Congress. And all but one... BARTIROMO: Right. WOLF: Only one have asked me about the health of my officers. All they want to do is condemn law enforcement for doing their job, and, again, very irresponsible. BARTIROMO: Bernie Sanders would also like to defund the Pentagon. The Democrats want to cut defense spending as well. And, real quick, give us your sense of what is happening in other cities across the country. Shootings are up 50 percent in New York. Crime, murder, and shootings are up in Chicago. What is happening in other cities, and how are you dealing with that? Tell us about Operation LeGend. WOLF: Absolutely. So, Operation LeGend is a Department of Justice-led operation into a number of cities. It has been on going in Kansas City. It is also taking place in Chicago, Albuquerque and a few others. And, again, what we're doing is, we're surging law enforcement assets into those cities to work on federal crimes that are being committed, whether it is gang violence or drug-related violence. And these are task forces that are occurring every day. And, again, federal officers are doing that in conjunction with state and local law enforcement officers. So, what we're doing is, we're surging resources, the Department of Homeland Security, using our Homeland Security investigation agents, are supporting that effort, again, trying to address some of the violent criminal activity that is occurring out in these cities that has gotten completely out of control. But I want to emphasize, we're doing that with state and local partnership, as we have done for the past several decades. Nothing is going to change there. We are going to continue to have that partnership with them. But what we are trying to do is, we're trying to put additional assets into those cities, so that we can investigate more, we can wrap up those investigations quicker, and we can make more arrests. BARTIROMO: And is there a coincidence that many of these cities are being run by Democrat officials? I just want to talk quickly about policy and whether or not the Democrat policies are encouraging this. Nancy Pelosi the other day called your agents Storm Troopers. You have got -- just like you said a moment ago, you have got officials saying these are peaceful things, and they're not peaceful. What do you say about all of these cities, which we are going to show on camera now, being run by Democrats? WOLF: Well, I'd say the comment from Speaker Pelosi that our federal law enforcement officers, civil law enforcement officers are Storm Troopers, are the Gestapo, or are thugs is absolutely irresponsible. It's dangerous. And she should immediately apologize for that. What we again see across these cities is violent crime occurring. We will continue to surge resources, not only in Portland, but in other cities across the country. But I do want to make a different -- a distinction, which we talked about at the top of this segment. What is going on in Portland is very different than any other -- any other city across the country. And that relationship with the federal law enforcement officers and those state and local law enforcement officers is very different in Portland as it is anywhere else. So, I want to make sure that everyone is clear about that, and there's no confusion. BARTIROMO: Understood. Thank you so much, Secretary. Great to have you this morning. We so appreciate it, acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf. We will be right back with Devin Nunes live. He's got breaking news on the Russian collusion hoax, the coup that failed. You will never believe which prestigious Washington think tank he says has links to developing the dossier -- next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) \u00a0BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Congressman Devin Nunes was among the first lawmakers to question the Russian collusion hoax, as then chairman of the House Intel Committee, telling us right here on this program three years ago that the FBI engaged in a coup to take down a sitting president. This week, he joined me on \"Mornings With Maria\" over on FOX Business with some breaking news on the Steele dossier. Watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. DEVIN NUNES (R-CA): Where we now see direct links between the Brookings Institute leadership and the creation of -- possibly of the Steele dossier and the dissemination of the Steele dossier. I think they have real answer -- questions that need to be answered here about, what on earth was the president of Brookings doing texting back and forth to Steele? Why was he accepting the dossier? (END VIDEO CLIP) BARTIROMO: Joining me right now with an update is Congressman Devin Nunes. He's the ranking member the House Intel Committee. Congressman, it is always a pleasure to see you. Thank you for being here. NUNES: Thank you. BARTIROMO: We have this breaking news this morning, as the subsource of the dossier, Igor Danchenko, has been unmasked. Tell me about this subsource and its tie -- his ties to Brookings. NUNES: Well, thank you, Maria. Thanks for having me on. You may remember, a couple months ago, I was on your show, and I talked about that we were really looking at three Russians. And as Senator Graham said at the beginning of the show, it ends up that we actually weren't looking for -- the third one was actually not a Russian at all. He actually -- it sounds like he lives here in America. And the FBI led Congress to believe that -- and the media led Congress to believe and they led the American public to believe that somehow Steele had this really super secret source that nobody could know about. Well, it ends up that he used to work for the Brookings Institute. It looks like there was a lot of connections to the Brookings Institute, which, for those of your viewers who don't know what this is, this is like the prominent left-wing think tank here in our nation's capital. So, we're investigating now, and have been. And we had these links earlier on. People may remember. The president of Brookings, back in 2016, we know that he had given the dossier to a few people. We had that through testimony. You also may remember that the State Department was involved and there were additional dossiers that weren't the Steele dossiers, except that they mirrored the Steele dossiers. And we think there is a connection between the president of Brookings and those dossiers that were given to the State Department that mirrored the Steele dossiers, which, look, all of this, what does this mean? These -- this was the Clinton campaign's dossiers. It was the dirt. It was a phony story that they sold, not only to the American people, but they sold it and corrupted our FBI, where it appears like these dirty cops were more than willing to take this information and present it to the FISA court. So, here is the final point on Brookings. BARTIROMO: Are you -- yes. NUNES: So, here's the final point. So, we have now expanded our investigation, full-blown investigation, into the Brookings Institute. And it really centers on two issues. One is the IRS. This is a tax-exempt organization. They're supposed to stay out of politics. They clearly have not done that. They have obstructed our investigation with propaganda for the last four years. It's well-known that they have attacked our investigation for four years through this kind of phony legal group of fact-checkers that they set up. BARTIROMO: Right. NUNES: So, we need to look at their -- see if they have been involved in politics. BARTIROMO: OK. NUNES: Secondly, they take... BARTIROMO: So, the -- yes. NUNES: Yes. Secondly, they take -- they also take foreign money from foreign countries and foreign governments. And we need to know what foreign governments were involved in this, because were they acting on behalf of a foreign power? Everybody questioned for all this time, you know, the Trump campaign and Republicans were involved with Russians. Well, who was the Brookings Institute -- who were their foreign donors? And are they doing all of this not just to help the Democratic Party, but also any foreign government? BARTIROMO: Well, what tells me -- what this all tells me, including the subsource revealed, is that there was indeed collusion in this country, but it was collusion with Hillary Clinton and the Democrats. Is that a fair statement? (LAUGHTER) NUNES: Well, yes. And it also just goes to show you that this was some sick fantasy that was made up by the Clinton campaign and their operatives. And think of this. You had people in the media -- remember this whole thing about prostitutes and Pee tapes in Moscow? These fools were running around all over Europe and Moscow, the leading institutions, these supposedly leading reporters, but nobody calls them out on that. And the whole thing was like some sick fantasy made up by the Clinton campaign. BARTIROMO: Well, many of them actually got Pulitzer Prizes for their reporting. NUNES: That's right. BARTIROMO: I want to ask you about Robert Mueller, because these items that were declassified clearly indicate that the FBI knew that the dossier was fake, that the dossier was hearsay and bar talk. How come Mueller didn't unearth these things? I mean, let's watch Robert Mueller when he testified in front of Congress to listen to what he said about things like Fusion GPS. Roll the clip. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: When you talk about the firm that produced the Steele reporting, the name of the firm that produced that was Fusion GPS. Is that correct? ROBERT MUELLER, RUSSIA PROBE SPECIAL COUNSEL: I'm not familiar with that. (CROSSTALK) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Well, let me just help you. It was. It's not a trick question or anything. It was Fusion GPS. (END VIDEO CLIP) BARTIROMO: \"I'm not familiar with it.\" NUNES: Yes. BARTIROMO: You have unearthed all of these things, Lindsey Graham declassifying the evidence that the FBI knew the dossier was garbage, and he had no recollection? I don't understand. Where was Mueller in all of this, Congressman? NUNES: Well, look, I think the question is, is, does Mueller know where Mueller is, OK? This was somebody who has put up as an avatar to give credibility to this investigation that was phony from the beginning, OK? So I'm not talking about just in 2016. I'm talking about the day that Mueller walks in the door. I'm not sure he knows what the hell's going on. And, clearly, a couple years later, when he testifies before Congress, to not know who Fusion GPS is was astounding. And, look, the Democratic Party -- it's very odd. For a party that seems to be against white people and always talking about racism, they sure like to, like, prop up these avatar old white dudes, where -- they have one running for president right now who's hiding in his basement, who won't answer questions. What was his involvement? Their presidential candidate supposedly went after him, was the one who concocted this idea to use the Logan Act to investigate the Trump campaign, and the incoming president, by the way. BARTIROMO: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Well, you have made 14 criminal referrals, with a 15th pending. We are waiting on John Durham to investigate that. We're going to hear more from John Durham, I assume. Let me move on, real quick, about the technology CEOs testifying, not in front of your committee, but they're going to be testifying this week in the House in front of the Judiciary Committee. You have said conservative censorship is the most important issue ahead of the 2020 election. What do you want to hear from people like the head of Twitter, the head of Google, et cetera, when they testify this week? NUNES: Well, look, Congress gave these guys special powers, so that they could create companies, so that people could go and use the Internet. It was supposed to be an open public square. Think of it as a public square, where everyone, as long as they're not -- as long as they're following the law, they can go out there and state their case, and participate in that public square. What's happened here is, is that Facebook and Google and Twitter are partisan hacks for the Democratic Party and the left. And so what's happening is, think of that -- go back to that public square example. They're deciding who gets to go into the public square. So, the good thing will be is that we're actually going to have the Parler CEO who's going to testify. And you can follow me at Parler @DevinNunes at Parler. BARTIROMO: Yes. NUNES: And he's been on your show, Maria. They have actually -- they're actually... BARTIROMO: Yes. NUNES: They have that town square. And they're letting all Americans go there and express their views. BARTIROMO: OK. We got to jump. Congressman, it's good to see you. Thank you so much, Devin Nunes. NUNES: My pleasure. BARTIROMO: We will be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) \u00a0BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo this week taking a hard line once again on Beijing, accusing the Chinese Communist Party of tyrannizing its people, while speaking at a Richard Nixon Library event in California on Thursday, Pompeo's rebuke coming just hours after two Chinese diplomats were caught trying to steal coronavirus vaccine research in Houston. Joining me right now is Ray Dalio. He's the co-chief investment officer and the co-investment officer of Bridgewater Associates and founder. It is great to see you once again, Ray. Thanks very much for joining me once again this week. RAY DALIO, CO-CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER/CO-CHAIRMAN, BRIDGEWATER ASSOCIATES: \u00a0Great to be here.\u00a0 \u00a0BARTIROMO: So, I want to talk about the economy and your thoughts on the dollar and all of the stimulus that we have seen in the Federal Reserve, Ray. But, first, I have got to get your reaction to all that we're seeing coming out of China. I know that you are a global investor. And you look for growth across the world. Would you still want to invest in China, given what we have learned about the Communist Party? DALIO: I think there are three things, three big things going on, and they operate together. And those are the important ones. The first is where we are in the debt cycle, the printing of money, and that. The second is how we are with each other, that we're having an ideological civil war that, when you combine that with an economic downturn, in which there is the printing of money and the creation of money out of thin air, is an issue. And then you have the rising power of China challenging the existing power. Those three things, the last time they happened was in the 1930-to-'45 period. I think you have to see them together. So, that is the position we're now in. In terms of China, we will -- we are in a conflict with China. You can call it a war, like the 1930s, so that there is a -- there is a trade war, there is a technology war, there is a geopolitical war, and there could be a capital war. And so that's the reality. Now regarding policy, that's for governments to set. But the challenge is to set it well, because, if you say, by law, don't invest in China, or even possibly withholding the payment of bonds that the United States owes payment on in China, these things are possibilities, and they have big implications, such as for the value of the dollar, because investors, free market investors, are not used to having those things dictated by the government. So, these are difficult questions that have to be well-addressed at this time. BARTIROMO: But would the -- would the news of one million Uyghurs being locked up in reeducation camps, the ignoring of the rule of law by stealing intellectual property, the overreach in Hong Kong, breaking promises there, militarizing the South China Sea, do any of these things come into focus when deciding to invest in China? DALIO: I think that we, as Americans, have got to decide on what's most important to us. And it becomes a challenge. For example, from the Chinese perspective, they believe that is an area of sovereignty and that those internal issues are be to dealt with by them, and we have to have -- just like they wouldn't deal in our internal issues. These are questions that individuals don't decide. Individuals have to decide... BARTIROMO: OK. DALIO: ... if they're ethical, if they're operating in ways that are consistent with their beliefs. That is a personal decision that you want to do. BARTIROMO: That is exactly right. DALIO: But the only -- but, at the end of the day... BARTIROMO: That's what I'm saying, yes. DALIO: At the end of the day, it will... BARTIROMO: Hold on, Ray. We're going to take -- we're going to -- yes. DALIO: At the end of the day... (CROSSTALK) BARTIROMO: We're going to take a break and then come back to that when we come right back. Stay with us, Ray Dalio. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BARTIROMO: We are back with Bridgewater chief investment officer Ray Dalio. And, Ray, a moment ago, you mentioned the potential for a capital war. I want to ask you about the economy and what your thoughts are about all of the stimulus being thrown at the economy, given this shutdown. Do you worry about the impact to the reserve currency, the dollar, Ray? DALIO: Yes, I -- we are only going to be successful if we do things in a solid way, right? So, the things I worry about the most are the soundness of our money. You can't continue to run deficits, sell debt, or print money, rather than be productive and sustain that over a period of time. And that relates to the money and what's now happening. And the second is the working together. I study history. And, as I say, the '30-to-'45 period is educational, because, within each country, there have been conflicts about -- like our conflicts. Four democracies chose to be dictatorships because of the disorder of how people are fighting with each other, rather than working together. If we don't work together to do the sound things, to be productive, to earn more than we spend, to build our currency, the stability of our currency, and build a good balance sheet, we are going to decline. We are declining because of those things. And so it's basically in those fundamentals that are the most important things that we deal with. We are our own worst enemy. BARTIROMO: Yes. DALIO: So, how we deal with each other soundly and productively, in a way... BARTIROMO: Yes. DALIO: ... that most people in the country believe is fair, is going to determine our future. BARTIROMO: Ray -- Ray, thank you.

For the first time, a Republican and Democrat are teaming up to do it, and both will be here on it. But, first, violence continues to escalate in Portland for 56 nights. And now the city is banning the police from working with federal officers. Welcome, everyone. I'm Charles Payne, in for Neil Cavuto. And this is \"Your World.\" To Dan Springer in Seattle with the very latest -- Dan. DAN SPRINGER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Yes, Charles, it was some of the worst violence yet in Portland. For several hours, hundreds of protesters battle with federal officers. And right in the middle of this was the city's mayor, Ted Wheeler. He was there for solidarity, for what he is calling or what he called last night a listening session. But when he started talking, he was shouted down with obscenity. He was called a Nazi. Someone spit at him, and he was told to resign by many people. Then he was hit with tear gas, not once, but twice. After the second guessing, his security detail, well, they got him out of the area to a sheltering in a city building nearby. Federal police were firing tear gas and flashbangs for hours, as hundreds of fireworks were shot at the federal courthouse. Arsonists also threw Molotov cocktails. They broke through a fence around the courthouse, set fires and tampered with a fire hydrant. But when asked about his tear gassing, Wheeler told a reporter that he saw nothing that would provoke that kind of response. The Department of Justice Office of Inspector General has opened a review of the conduct of the federal officers in Portland. Several lawsuits have been filed claiming civil rights abuses. But the federal agencies are pushing back, saying that three of their officers may lose their sight after getting hit in the eyes with laser beams. At least 38 officers have been doxed, their identities revealed on social media. And now the Portland City Council has passed a law banning the Portland P.D. from helping the federal officers in any way. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CHAD WOLF, ACTING U.S. SECRETARY OF HOMELAND SECURITY: It does not allow local law enforcement to coordinate or support, even in perhaps life- threatening situations, federal officers. That is dangerous. (END VIDEO CLIP) SPRINGER: Portland police did eventually declare a riot last night, but they never engaged. Not a single arrest was made -- Charles. PAYNE: Dan, thank you very much. Defund cities that defund the police, well, that's what two lawmakers, a Democrat and a Republican, are proposing. With me now, New York Democrat Congressman Anthony Brindisi, along with Pennsylvania Republican Congressman Brian Fitzpatrick. Welcome, Congressmen. Let me start with you, Congressman Brindisi. How exactly would this work? REP. ANTHONY BRINDISI (D-NY): Well, what the bill says is that, if a city moves to defund the police department, if they want to abolish the police department or significantly cut funding to a police department, then they - - that would put them at risk of losing certain federal grants. And I think we have to step back and acknowledge that our law enforcement does, by and large, very good work. Most officers serve with dignity and respect. And these are very difficult times that our country is going through right now. We should be having conversations about how we reform policing and improve relations. However, I don't think we should be doing that at the expense of cutting back at -- on things like community engagement programs, or body cameras, which hold bad actors accountable, or on training, which police need to be able to protect and serve. PAYNE: Representative Fitzpatrick, we have already seen where individual cities have already taken the initiative, New York City, a billion-dollar cut, AOC actually asking and demanding a lot more. Do you think this will be enough of a disincentive, or do we need a bigger public relations campaign? REP. BRIAN FITZPATRICK (R-PA): Well, this is all part of the whole push, Charles. I'm a career FBI agent, I spent my entire adult life in law enforcement. And my goal was to build a bipartisan coalition here in Washington, D.C., to make sure that we have a voice defending our police officers. They are under assault right now. And they need our support. Do we need to make reforms? Of course we do. And our coalition believes that that should happen. And we will do that in a responsible manner. But these calls to defund the police -- Mayor de Blasio cut $1 billion out of a $6 billion budget of the NYPD, at a time when they need more help than they ever have. We need some voices of reason. And they need to start speaking up. And that's what we're going to do. And like everything I do, we're going to do this in a bipartisan manner to make sure we get the whole country on board. PAYNE: Representative Brindisi, you have got some very powerful voices in your party, your political party. I'd be interested in a couple things, first, the kind of pushback or agreement that you're seeing and talking about behind closed doors, and also the images that we're getting out of Portland, where, clearly, elected officials are making the police and the federal law enforcement agents the bad guys. They're turning them into villains in a public relations campaign that I think is making this worse. They're emboldening those folks out there who - - it's not just a peaceful protest, not all 56 nights. BRINDISI: Yes, you're exactly correct. And I think that the point behind this legislation -- and I commend Congressman Fitzpatrick, and I'm proud to work with him on this -- is to really build a bipartisan coalition here, because, by and large, if you poll the majority of Americans, they will tell you, yes, we do have to see some reforms to policing. Yes, we have to improve relationships between police and the communities that they're charged with protecting and serving. But, by and large, the Americans on both sides, I think, are against abolishing police departments, defunding police departments. And that's what this bill is meant to address. PAYNE: All right. BRINDISI: And we're building this bipartisan coalition. I have talked to a number of members on my side of the aisle who are interested in this legislation. And we should have respect for law enforcement. As I said at the top, it's a dangerous profession. These men and women risk their lives every single day when they go out there to defend us. I have heard some of the heartbreaking stories of the officers in Portland and other cities. And it's tough right now to be a police officer. PAYNE: I want to just follow up, Representative Brindisi, about the presidential candidate for your party, Joe Biden. He hasn't used the word defund, but he has used the term redirect. Maybe it's a game of semantics. It means the same thing to me, if money is not going into the police departments, which, by the way, could use extra funding for these improvements in the training that everyone is -- everyone agrees that they should have. BRINDISI: Well, if you look at -- when you start cutting back -- and many police budgets are already under strain -- when you start cutting back, the first thing the departments will start cutting are things like community policing, community engagement programs, training, things like that, gear that is necessary for officer safety. And these are all things that are important, body cameras, that are important to help protect and improve relations between the police departments and the communities that they serve. And I'm all for investing in mental health and education. I think our officers are being asked to do way more than they have to right now. They're becoming educators, health care professionals, mental health counselors. PAYNE: Right. BRINDISI: So, they do need some help. And we do need to be making investments at the local level, the state level, and the federal level in mental health and education, but not at the expense of taking away things like community engagement programs and training for police. PAYNE: All right. Representative Fitzpatrick, what I'm concerned about, of course, is the -- is the message that's coming from very highly regarded politicians. Again, I would love to see Vice President Biden come out and not use terms like redirect, and claim it's not the same as defund. And, by the same token, the American public overwhelmingly is against this idea. So, do you think they will -- maybe we can stem the tide of this crazy notion of defunding the police? FITZPATRICK: That's exactly what we're doing down here, Charles. That's why I'm building a bipartisan coalition that, as Anthony mentioned, is growing. PAYNE: Yes. FITZPATRICK: There are a lot of people that are interested in joining this. And we will be the voice to have the backs of the men and women that serve our communities. We all see the terrible images on television. They have -- they have always had a hard job. Their job is especially hard now. PAYNE: Right. FITZPATRICK: And they need our -- they need our support, and they're going to get our support. PAYNE: It's extremely hard. And we salute both of you. It's rare we see bipartisanship, particularly on something like this. Thank you both very much. FITZPATRICK: Thank you, Charles. PAYNE: Meanwhile, folks, the question, is Washington so focus on extra unemployment checks running out, that they're ignoring the debt clock that's running up? White House Budget Director Russ Vought joins me. He's next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) PAYNE: Stocks falling on signs that a coronavirus relief push Washington may be stalling, but maybe not. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is on the Senate floor, speaking about the new push for a new bill. Let's go to Chad Pergram with the very latest -- Chad. CHAD PERGRAM, FOX NEWS SENIOR CAPITOL HILL PRODUCER: Well, this is coming right off the presses as we speak here. The Senate majority leader was expected to release a framework for this coronavirus bill this morning. That did not happen. We got nothing but radio silence. But here's what he said in just the past couple of minutes. He says he will release a framework for this bill next week. And it will include three major tenets. He says kids, jobs and health care. Now, there seems to be a lot of dissonance on the Republican side of the aisle. And the reason this is taking a long time to get together is that not all Republicans are in agreement here. And this is why Chuck Schumer, the minority leader, says that the GOP is in disarray. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY), MINORITY LEADER: They have been so divided, so disorganized, so unprepared that they have struggled to even draft a partisan proposal within their own conference. They can't come together. (END VIDEO CLIP) PERGRAM: The secretary of the Treasury, Steve Mnuchin, today announced the administration would drop its demand for a payroll tax cut. There were only about 10 Republican senators who supported that, and it would explode the deficit to the tune of hundreds of billions of dollars. Plus, there are divides about extending unemployment benefits. Republicans raised hackles back in March that some people would receive more money off the job than on. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. LISA MURKOWSKI (R-AK): And I do think that what we're trying to do is to avoid some of the unintended consequences that we saw with the full-on $600 added to every state's base unemployment. (END VIDEO CLIP) PERGRAM: Now, there's kind of an artificial deadline at the end of next week, July 31. That's when these unemployment benefits, these extra unemployment benefits expire. And Republican and Democratic senators, they have to come to an agreement if they want to have more direct payments to Americans. These are the nitty-gritty details, and the cost of those and the price tag there, that's going to be major -- Charles, back to you. PAYNE: Chad, before I let you go, the $600, there was a report out earlier, Mnuchin saying 70 percent of people's incomes. That's a big difference for a whole lot of working Americans. That's a giant gulf to navigate in a very short period of time. PERGRAM: Absolutely. And that's why we were hearing numbers of maybe just $100 or $200 there. Republicans are very concerned about the price tag. But just because they say that this is going to be the last bill, there's worry that there might be another bill sometime in the fall or the winter, if this continues to grow. PAYNE: Right. PERGRAM: And I talked about the overall cost of that payroll tax cut, which seems to be off the table right now, Charles. PAYNE: All right, Chad, thank you very much. Always appreciate it. So, how does not including a payroll tax cut in this next coronavirus release bill sit with the White House? I want to bring in right now Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought. Russ, congratulations on the job being permanent. Let's talk about some of the things we -- that was thrown out there, including this payroll -- payroll tax cut. Apparently, it will not be part of the final package. How is President Trump feeling about that? RUSSELL VOUGHT, WHITE HOUSE BUDGET DIRECTOR: Well, he's obviously disappointed that it's headed in that direction, but he wants to get a bill. We're hard at work trying to get a bill. Unfortunately, we are dealing with a recalcitrant Democrat majority that is insisting that we fund big government, as opposed to pro-growth economic policies that get this economy back in terms of the V-shaped recovery. PAYNE: Speaking of the V-shaped recovery, J.P. Morgan last week said that extra 600 bucks was the magic ingredient, that people went out and they spent that extra 600 bucks, and that's why we saw employment come back so quickly, we saw a record-breaking retail sales rebound. So, they're essentially saying, if you take that away, you really endanger the recovery. How are you feeling about that? VOUGHT: Well, I think it's important to take a step back and remember that unemployment benefits is going to go on and exist for the entirety of this year. Most states have about a year's worth of unemployment insurance. That's not going to just artificially sunset at the end of next week. What we're talking about is the additional benefit on top of that, that Congress put in place... PAYNE: Right. VOUGHT: ... that has provided a disincentive for small businesses to be able to get their workers back, because they get more money than they had previously worked for. So, we're trying to make sure we remove that disincentive, still do something to be able to extend at somewhere in the neighborhood of 70 percent, so that you're not -- it's not 100 percent of what you used to make, and be able to remove that disincentive to get people back to work working for small businesses. PAYNE: And for those who don't have a job waiting for them, but now they're only getting 70 percent of their incomes, it's a heck of a calculation that the White House and Republicans have to make on this. VOUGHT: Well, again, we're not for not doing any bill. We want to be able to continue to put people -- put money in people's pockets, continue to do -- get a bill done. We have got to get this economy continuing to be on the mend, approximating a V-shaped recovery. But we have got to do it right, Charles. And we got to make sure we remove disincentives, so that small businesses can get the workers back to work. PAYNE: What kind of -- speaking of small businesses, what other adjustments can there be for the PPP program? Eighty-five percent of the applications went to these $150,000 or less, but almost 85 percent of the money went to the bigwigs, you know, these million-dollar bailouts. That did not sit well with the general public. VOUGHT: Sure. Well, we have got money that still has not been spent, about $130 billion that can be reallocated. You know, I think, at the end of the day, the PPP program is going to be an incredibly successful program. History will speak kindly about this program. And I think the examples where it went to those that it was not intended for will be the vast minority, and that this went to diners, and small hardware stores, and small businesses across the country. PAYNE: Right. VOUGHT: And I think you're going to see history reflect very well on that important program. PAYNE: I'm inclined to believe you're 100 percent right. History is going to look kindly on the way the federal government reacted, the White House, the Federal Reserve, and programs like PPP, which -- which makes people wonder, is Mitch McConnell -- are they taking this too slow at this point? I mean, when Mitch McConnell says, kids, jobs and health care, I'm not even sure what he's talking about. But many are saying, we need to cobble something together before July 31. VOUGHT: Well, we're at -- hard at work to be able to do that. I don't think that Senate Republican leadership is in any way trying to take this slow. I think they're working very hard to get a bill that can pass. Our negotiators are hard at work doing that. On the school front, we want to make sure that we have taken the excuse for schools to open up off the table, and we want to put in policies that... PAYNE: Right. VOUGHT: ... help incentivize them to reopen. And so I think that's what we refer to when we're talking about kids. PAYNE: OK. VOUGHT: But we have got to make sure the policy gets right. And that's what we're hard at work doing. PAYNE: Yes, if kids don't go back to school, there is no economy, because so many parents can't go back to work. Russ, I want to ask you about the White House rolling back this Obama era, affinity -- Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing. It's sort of a tongue- twister known as AFFH. It came about in 2015. It was -- President Obama attached this to some of the things for HUD. Ben Carson pushed hard that this was too complicated, it was too costly. President Trump listened. And now there are howls saying that this is discriminatory and it's racist. Explain why this should have been taken out of this, out of the HUD's program. VOUGHT: Yes, it has nothing to do with racism. And it is a tongue-twister. But, basically, what you saw was a -- President Obama and Vice President Biden's war on the suburbs, where you were using the power of the federal government to bully neighborhoods and localities into changing their zoning restrictions, and to be able to reflect and deal with artificial balances, imbalances that might exist that have nothing to do with race. And what we have come along and done is to basically say, we believe you can further fair housing by providing affordable, safe, decent, nondiscriminatory housing without the federal government bullying mayors and local officials into changing their zoning restrictions to do away with single family houses. PAYNE: You know, there's a war on the single-family home. It's an ideological war. And this was part of it. I believe that the single-family home, the white picket fence -- it sounds corny, Russ -- I still think that's the American dream, and some people don't like that. Congratulations, again, and it's great having you on the show. We appreciate it. VOUGHT: Thanks, Charles. PAYNE: Well, batter up, because, baseball, it's finally opening up. The pros are ready to play. And something tells me viewers are ready to watch. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) \u00a0PAYNE: Play ball. Opening day is here, and it's just hours away. Abby Hornacek will join us on just how it's all going to go down. And we will be back in 60 seconds. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) PAYNE: Well, the first pitch of the Major League Baseball season just a little over two hours away, as players prepare for a season without fans in the stands -- well, or at least without real people. All right, want to go to Abby Hornacek, who is going to fill us in on this brave new world. (LAUGHTER) PAYNE: Now, listen, I know robots and androids are taking all of our jobs, but they're going to be the fans now, too? ABBY HORNACEK, \"PARK'D\" HOST: They're taking our spots. Yes, they're taking our spots in the stands, Charles. What is going on? (LAUGHTER) HORNACEK: No, I actually think that this is a great idea. They are experimenting with virtual fans. And, of course, it's not ideal, but I think it's our best option right now. And here is why. So, they have been talking about how they're going to pipe in these crowd noises at the games, which my first reaction was, this is going to sound like a really bad sitcom, when people are laughing in the background and there's no one actually in studio. But when you add in this augmented reality, you're putting life behind those sounds. And, Charles, I don't know about you. But when I watch a baseball game, I'm not looking at the faces of the fans, minus the times where you get that viral video of maybe a guy holding a baby and a beer, and then there's a foul ball and the ball lands in the beer. Then it matters. But I think people will get used to the fact that these are not real people. And it looks so realistic, they will forget about it altogether. PAYNE: So -- but we're not at that stage yet, though, where, say, there is a foul ball, that one of these the android-like things gets up and catches it. I mean, have they gotten that advanced yet? HORNACEK: Can that happen? PAYNE: Or will they just -- what's going to happen? (LAUGHTER) HORNACEK: Yes. You know, I'm not sure. I think that they just disappear. (CROSSTALK) HORNACEK: If they could make some form of augmented -- if they could make some form of augmented reality that could catch balls... PAYNE: What are the players saying about this? HORNACEK: So, here's the thing about the players. And I think the reaction with fans, is that OK? Well, this might be a little weird to watch on TV. I honestly don't think that the players care, because I actually watched a really interesting interview this morning with Pete Alonso. And he was saying that, look, these guys come up through the farm system. So they're not used to playing -- until they reach the majors, they're not used to playing in front of these crowds that you get at Citi Field or Yankee Stadium. So I really don't think they -- it matters -- it matters to them. They just want to play ball. And, if anything, it'll hopefully return them to the reason that they started playing baseball in the first place, for the love of the game. PAYNE: Well, all right, I hear you there. But what about the home field advantage, that energy that the home team gets from the crowd, and they're behind, and it's the bottom of the ninth? And there's something that you feel, right? I mean, no matter what sport it is, you feel it, and it seems to put teams over the top. Is that going to be gone? HORNACEK: I -- yes, I do think an aspect of that will be gone. But with this augmented reality, they're talking about that they can switch the colors of the people in the crowd. They can switch their jerseys or the colors catering to whatever team is having the home field advantage. And get this, Charles. They will make the fans leave if it's a blowout. (LAUGHTER) HORNACEK: So, people are going to be watching that on TV, but the players aren't going to be feeling that. So they're just going to have to get over it, I think. PAYNE: Yes. HORNACEK: Take it back to the little league days, you know? PAYNE: Yes. Yes. What are we looking at now? Who's the favorite? Has anything changed with respect to the who's going to win this year? Have the oddsmakers made any sort of adjustments because of all this? HORNACEK: Yes, you do see the odds changing a little bit. But I think that it -- what's going to really change it is seeing opening day and how all of this plays out and how it plays out for fans at home. Who is watching? I do think that a lot of people are eager to get back there. Sports bettors are eager to get back out there and start laying some action all these games. So I think we will see that shift. And then you have the universal designated hitter, which has been kind of a change, and only 60 games. So, each game matters more. You're not looking at a normal baseball season. PAYNE: Other sports, so we have got racing, we have got baseball, there's the NBA, everyone under the dome. That's going to be another weird experience. But there were questions of whether or not sports would continue. And it looks like we're going to make it through, right? HORNACEK: I think we are, Charles. And it's good for fans. It's good for the players. I think everyone's just eager to see something. And sports have had a universal effect on bringing people together. So, hopefully, that happens in today's climate as well. But the NBA, they're working on their bubble. And baseball is different, because there will be traveling, and there is more of a risk with getting on airplanes and all of that. But I do think we will slowly see sports coming back. NFL season is actually talking about maybe using this augmented reality... PAYNE: Right. HORNACEK: ... with their fans as well. So, baseball's definitely laying the groundwork when it comes to that stuff. PAYNE: All right, well, I want to see these -- this augmented reality crowd in the seventh inning stretch. I want to hear them singing \"Take Me Out to the Ball Game.\" Abby, thank you very much. HORNACEK: I actually -- Charles, I heard a rumor that you're actually going to be singing the seventh inning stretch, and it's going to be an augmented reality of you. (LAUGHTER) HORNACEK: So, I'm looking forward to seeing that. PAYNE: I'm working on it. You got it. See you soon. HORNACEK: Great. Great. PAYNE: You might see me tonight. HORNACEK: Thank you. Great. PAYNE: Hey, in the meantime, we know former President Barack Obama is making a big pitch for Joe Biden's run, but is he also pitching someone to run with him? We will be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) PAYNE: California Democrat Senator Kamala Harris holding a virtual campaign event for Joe Biden. Now, she is said to be on his short list for a running mate. Today, Biden also releasing his latest this pre-taped talk with Barack Obama. Could the former president be steering his former vice president towards a certain V.P. pick? Joining me now, RealClearPolitics' Phil Wegmann. Phil, apparently, I keep reading where Joe Biden is down to four black women as potential V.P. candidates. When I peruse the news further, I see more names in there. Is anyone sort of moving ahead of the pack here? PHILIP WEGMANN, REALCLEARPOLITICS: We know that Kamala Harris certainly seems interested. And there are rumors that she's actually putting out opposition research on other candidates. Those are unconfirmed at this point, but it shows how significant the stakes are. Not only would Biden's V.P. pick obviously be one heartbeat away from the presidency and possibly be his successor, but whoever he picks as a possible vice president, that's going to show us how and according to what ideology a Biden administration would govern from. So this is going to be something to keep a very close eye on, obviously, as we get closer to the Milwaukee convention. PAYNE: So, Phil, I'm looking at the names, Val Demings, Keisha Lance Bottoms, Kamala Harris, Karen Bass, Susan Rice. And I get, OK, he's going to be able to check the box black woman, but the younger part of this political party, where the energy is, the more progressive part of it, does anyone fulfill that area? Because, listen, Bernie Sanders was very close to winning this thing, if it wasn't maybe for a last-minute pushed by Clyburn. WEGMANN: No, you're absolutely right. And while Biden has said that he's going to pick a woman as his vice president, he needs to be able to put someone in that position who's going to maintain African-American support through the general election. Remember, it was black voters who brought Biden's campaign really back from the dead in South Carolina. And then the second part here, which goes to the heart of your question, is, he's got to find someone who is going to make younger voters enthusiastic. Not long ago, during the primary, a lot of millennials, a lot of younger voters were literally saying, please don't make me vote for Joe Biden. So those are two considerations that he has to take care of with whoever he picks. PAYNE: Let's throw out a third one, the enthusiasm gap. Now, of course, there's no doubt a black V.P. would energize the black vote, particularly black women, who really know how to get the entire community out to the polls. But we have seen a tremendous lack of enthusiasm for Joe Biden, and, more recently, his unfavorables have begun to skyrocket. So is there something to be said about a certain spark, a certain kind of energy that could also get more people out? Because I think that's one area that probably won't change for him. WEGMANN: And that's a reflection of the type of campaign that Joe Biden has run so far. He's been running a campaign that has been in self-isolation because of the coronavirus. I think that a vice president pick who could really energize people with newer ideas, folks on the left, that would do his campaign quite a bit of good. David Axelrod talked about this problem in a recent piece, where he pointed out that whoever Biden picks needs to be able to help him win the election, but then the larger question is, not only help him win the election, but be a lieutenant who is ready on day one to really go brawl with Republicans on Capitol Hill, because it is going to be a fight for him to get anything that he has proposed to the finish line. PAYNE: Right. Right. I mean, with this list, he doesn't get a state that he wasn't going to get anywhere and those kinds of things. Barack Obama, former President Obama, is there any -- who's he leaning towards? Is there someone that he might be out there pushing? WEGMANN: Well, we know that President Obama has kept close ties within the party. He was close to Senator Harris. And he was complimentary of a lot of the things that she did. I think that Obama is clearly a voice in Joe Biden's ear right now. He has a tremendous amount of sway. PAYNE: Right. WEGMANN: And not only is he able to sort of bring back some of the nostalgia among Democratic voters by being on stage with Joe Biden. I think that he is a powerful counsel for his former vice president. The two trust each other, and I think he's going to have a significant influence on who Biden picks. PAYNE: Next time, I want the gossip. Who's throwing who under the bus? I will let you off the hook this time. Phil, thank you very much. WEGMANN: Thank you, sir. PAYNE: All right, more cities rolling back their reopenings, as coronavirus cases keep climbing, but are these new lockdowns keeping the economy locked down? (COMMERCIAL BREAK) PAYNE: Well, you're looking live at Chicago and Baltimore, where restrictions are being reimposed tomorrow, as both cities continue to see an uptick in coronavirus cases. So, the question, of course, is, are all these rollbacks holding the economy back? I want to bring in market watcher Heather Zumarraga. Heather, today we got initial jobless claims, the first uptick after 16 straight weeks of decline. A lot of that can be attributed to the fact that many places where we saw reopenings, then they stalled, or they closed, or they reversed. Just how much havoc is this going to create with the economy? HEATHER ZUMARRAGA, FINANCIAL ANALYST: Well, I think this is already creating a lot of havoc in the economy. Now, the stock market is a completely different animal, or has been, at least. When you look at the jobs data, if there is one silver lining, it's that continuing claims have come down, still over a stunning 16 million people filing for continuing claims over and over again. But the number is coming down. And that matters more than the 52 million that originally have filed for unemployment, but not continue to do so. PAYNE: Right. And, Heather, here's the thing. We know that these start, stop, start stops, one of the thing that this V-shaped recovery needed is momentum, because it's -- against all the odds, it's done so much better. Our economy has done so much better than any expert thought it would. But now these experts are back saying, OK, now we're going to be right. Now the V-shape starts to plateau. Now we go back down. And it bothers me, because a lot of these places that are reclosing, I feel, sometimes, it's as much a political decision as a health decision. And if that's the case, they're deliberately harming the economy. ZUMARRAGA: Absolutely. But, look, it should not be political. The economy should remain open, but not at the expense of people's lives or people getting sick. But you wear a mask, like Baltimore mayor and governor of Maryland is enforcing now, and you social distance. The news that we got about the bar in Chicago closing permanently, for good, they're not alone. You're seeing businesses across the board having to shut their doors because we're shutting the economy down. According to Yelp, for example, almost 70,000 small businesses have just given up and they're saying, I can't do this anymore. And so it shouldn't be a matter of a political debate, of Democrats wanting to shut down the economy to save lives and Republicans wanting to keep it open to keep the economy going. There should be a middle common ground that we can take safe measures and cautious measures to keep the economy open. PAYNE: Well, and the realization is that, until there is a vaccine that is -- we have to learn how to coexist, even prosper, amid the virus. So, this is not a long-term option, in my mind. At some point, every state, every municipality, every city has to reopen their economies to a certain degree, or the carnage is going to be so much more than you could believe. ZUMARRAGA: Oh, yes. And I think what's important to most Americans now is not just that $600- per-week unemployment supplemental insurance that's wearing off, but what are we going to do with PPP? Democrats are all in favor of doing another round, as are most Republicans, but this time it will be targeted more towards small businesses. Secretary -- Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has said that. Those that were hit at least 50 percent by COVID will be helped to keep businesses going, and open not those big Harvard endowments or the Potbellys are the Ruth's Chris or those that may not need it. We want to help the people that were shut down due to no circumstance of their own, that this was a self-inflicted shutdown. PAYNE: Right. Heather, you mentioned the $600 additional money, the federal money on top of the typical state unemployment claims. What number should be out there? What is the ultimate number that they should agree on, understanding that a lot of that could probably immediately go back into the economy, but also pile up on the debt? It's a difficult conversation. But we do see where the markets are becoming concerned about this. And that seems to be one of the major battlegrounds between the two parties. ZUMARRAGA: Oh, absolutely. I mean, that's what the fight is about right now. What is that number going to be? Democrats want to extend the benefits at $600 per week. And Republicans are saying, how about $200, maybe $300? Or what Steven Mnuchin is saying is that we give 70 percent of your income. So you target the number to what people making before, because the biggest problem would be that you're receiving more income by staying at home than going to work. And some may deem that an insensitive comment to those that have lost their jobs, but it's really not, because in order to sustain the economy over the long run, you want people to be working and to be employed. And so you can't make more unemployed than you are when you're working. And that's why that's 70 percent of your income prior to COVID number is being looked at by the GOP. PAYNE: Do we need a deal by July 31? Some are arguing that's an artificial deadline, although we do know that's when those extended benefits expire. ZUMARRAGA: Well, if you look at Speaker Pelosi saying that we definitely need a bill by the end of the month, and Larry Kudlow is pretty optimistic. He's running Economic Council over at the White House. PAYNE: Right. ZUMARRAGA: But then you have House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy saying, oh, we might not get it by the end of the month. But I think those 52 million Americans that have filed for unemployment do want some type of extension. PAYNE: I think so too. And I think we saw the market, the Dow off over 300 points. ZUMARRAGA: Yes. PAYNE: It will down a lot more than that, putting a lot of pressure on all those folks. ZUMARRAGA: Oh, yes. PAYNE: Heather, thank you very much. Appreciate it. ZUMARRAGA: Thanks, Charles. PAYNE: All right, folks, with tensions with China flaring up, now Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is about to deliver a major speech smacking them down. Where is this showdown heading? We will be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) \u00a0PAYNE: You're looking live at the White House. President Trump is about to hold a news conference on reopening schools, among other things. When he takes the podium, we will take you there. Meanwhile, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo about to speak at the Richard Nixon Presidential Library in Yorba Linda, California, as tensions continued to rise between the United States and China. Rich Edson on what Secretary Pompeo is saying -- Rich. RICH EDSON, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Hi. Good evening, Charles. And Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is going to justify the U.S. closing the Chinese Consulate in Houston because he says it was a hub of spying and intellectual property theft. That's according to the prepared remarks for the secretary's speech that he's about to give at the Nixon Presidential Library in Yorba Linda, California. The secretary mentions President Nixon's historic 1972 visit to China and says engagement with the Chinese government has since failed to live up to the change Nixon had hoped to create. He says democracies must abandon blind engagement with China and -- quote -- \"General Secretary Xi Jinping is a true believer in a bankrupt totalitarian ideology. We can no longer ignore the fundamental political and ideological differences between our countries.\" Pompeo floats the creation of an international alliance of democracies to induce change in China's government. Just yesterday, the State Department ordered the Chinese government to vacate its consulate in Houston. China is warning the U.S. to reverse that decision, and, if not, promising to retaliate. The FBI claims China's consulate in San Francisco is protecting a Chinese researcher who prosecutors have charged with lying about her military background to get a visa to come to the United States. State Department officials say there's been a marked increase in Chinese spying activity in the United States over the past few years. And in just the past month, there has been a significant deterioration in U.S.-China relations. The United States has authorized and enacted sanctions on Chinese government officials and businesses that were involved in massive human rights abuses in Northwest Xinjiang, China, and, of course, revoking that special trading status that Hong Kong once enjoyed -- Charles. PAYNE: Rich, thank you very much. And you're looking live, as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is going to give the speech right now, this, of course, as China is threatening retaliation for the closure of its Houston consulate, while it harbors what the U.S. says is a military-linked fugitive in San Francisco. So, where's all this going? I want to go to former State Department senior adviser Christian Whiton, who joins us now. Certainly, the cold war is heating up, Christian. What's the next step? CHRISTIAN WHITON, FORMER U.S. DEPUTY SPECIAL ENVOY: Well, the next step is waiting to see what the Chinese will do. This looks like the U.S. ratcheting up tensions, but what really it is, is, frankly, just the U.S. finally getting its head in the game. President Trump throughout his administration has been tough on China, particularly on trade, trying to bring some equity and some fairness to that relationship and putting tariffs on more than half of what we import from China. But the political pushback on the criminal realm and now the diplomatic realm has been a little slower coming, but now it's coming full force. What Secretary Pompeo is going to say today really is, frankly, Reaganesque. It's language we haven't really seen this starkly from the administration, so I think a good turn. But as for the embassy -- or -- excuse me -- the consulate closure in Houston, the Chinese presumably will retaliate. PAYNE: Right. WHITON: I sort of doubt their ability to retaliate as strongly, but that's probably coming. PAYNE: So, when they said Houston consulate was a hub of spying and I.P. theft, no one's surprised, per se, and yet they keep feigning this, wow, you guys are pushing us around. And I think, to a certain extent, Christian, they get a lot of help from the U.S. media, which seems to take China's side or seems to be sympathetic that President Trump once again pushing China around. Isn't it about time we took this kind of stand? WHITON: Absolutely, it is. But, absolutely, you're right that our media, the mainstream media, is doing China's bidding. The Washington Post editor who covers east Asia yesterday said this move to close the consulate was just President Trump trying to distract from coronavirus. Well, The Washington Post actually takes money from China Daily, millions of dollars to run content from China Daily in its newspaper. That is a propaganda organ of the Chinese government. PAYNE: Right. WHITON: So, you can understand why maybe The Washington Post isn't as excited about this. But you're seeing, I think, a very strong turn in the executive branch and also on Capitol Hill, where you have bipartisan support for a tougher approach on China. And Senator James Risch, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, just introducing a new bill today that would codify a lot of what President Trump has been talking about. PAYNE: Right. Christian, it's so appropriate this is at the Richard Nixon Library. In 1972, our GDP was 900 percent higher than China's. Last year, it was 30 percent higher. All that theft has paid off big time for China, in addition to not having to live by the same trade rules as everyone else. WHITON: It has. And, if President Nixon were alive today, I think he would be in favor of reevaluating the opening of China that he commenced back in 1973. And Henry Kissinger, who is alive today and who did recently meet with President Trump, I think would also be in favor of taking a look. PAYNE: Right. WHITON: When we engaged China first, the idea was to separate from the Soviet Union. And we did. And that was effective. But we're in a very different environment today. PAYNE: Yes, a lot has changed since 1972. Christian, always appreciate it. Thank you, my friend. WHITON: Thank you, Charles. PAYNE: Hey, folks, real quick, did you see this, Lady Liberty standing tall as lightning strikes, as she is fully charging? You know what? So am I. You got to check me out every weekday 2:00 p.m. on FOX Business. You do not want to miss \"Making Money.\" It's my main job, but, sometimes, I have got to save your money as well.

I'm Mike Emanuel in for Bret Baier. President Trump is taking a quick trip to Mount Rushmore to watch some July third fireworks along with thousands of people. The event comes despite the U.S. reporting another record high in new coronavirus cases today. In his speech tonight, President Trump is expected to speak about the history of America and warned against those he sees trying to divide the country. We will have life coverage of the big event tonight at 10:00 p.m. Eastern. The president will return to Washington well past midnight to prepare for tomorrow's festivities back home at the White House. That's where we begin tonight with Correspondent Mark Meredith on the North Lawn. Good evening, Mark. MARK MEREDITH, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Good evening to you, Mike. At this hour, the president and first lady, they are in the air making their way to Mount Rushmore for that fireworks as you also mentioned, they'll be having a remarks tonight. While they are there in South Dakota, we expect the president is going to call out cancel culture and also criticize those that want to tear down monuments in the name of rewriting American history. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We're going to Mount Rushmore. MEREDITH: President Trump is kicking off his holiday weekend with a trip to South Dakota's Mount Rushmore where at least 75,000 people are expected to watch a fireworks extravaganza. TRUMP: I'll be seeing a lot of people, a lot of different people. And I think it will be a fantastic evening. MEREDITH: Organizers say masks will be provided but people won't be required to wear them. Meantime, some Native American tribes who calls South Dakota home are protesting the visit, they want Mount Rushmore torn down. The leader of the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe writing, we are the ones who live under the stare of those who have wronged us. On Saturday, the president will host a salute to America event. The White House inviting front-line workers including doctors and nurses to the celebration while tens of thousands are expected to gather on the National Mall for a military flyover and fireworks. Mall goers are encouraged to practice social distancing. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: CDC says larger gatherings are a higher risk. You have to take that into account again with whether or not you're at risk, whether you live with someone who is vulnerable and then you have to take measures to say safe. MEREDITH: As several states experience a surging COVID cases, Dr. Anthony Fauci says the virus itself may be mutating, essentially allowing it to spread more easily. But he says more research is needed to know for sure. DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES: It just seems that the virus replicates better and may be more transmissible, but this is still at the stage of trying to confirm that. MEREDITH: President Trump tweeted Thursday, the increase in cases is easy to explain, writing, quote, there's a rising coronavirus cases because our testing is so massive and so good. Far bigger and better than any other country. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Joe Biden can't fix our economy. MEREDITH: The president's campaign is focused elsewhere. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Trade deals that let China and Mexico steal our jobs. MEREDITH: The Trump campaign released this new T.V. ad today only hours after the June jobs report showed 4.8 million jobs were added last month. The ad maybe the most clear sign yet the Trump campaign hopes to win voters over by appealing directly to people's pocketbooks. (END VIDEOTAPE) MEREDITH: In his remarks tonight, the president expected to call America a great and virtuous country but he's also going to say some of the chaos that we've seen these last couple of weeks is a responsibility of a left- wing mob, Mike. EMANUEL: Mark Meredith leading us off on the North Lawn. Mark, many thanks. The way that spikes started in the South moved West, but now at least 40 states are seeing climbing new coronavirus cases. Governors have ordered the wearing of masks in public and families are being urged to celebrate Independence Day at home. Correspondent Jonathan Serrie is in Atlanta looking at the concerning coronavirus trends across the country. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) TERRENCE REIDY, UNDERSECRETARY, MASSACHUSETTS PUBLIC SAFETY: The virus isn't taking a holiday. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Feel pain anywhere? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No. JONATHAN SERRIE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: As the U.S. grapples with a new spike in COVID-19 cases, this July 4th promises to be like no other. With many cities canceling or scaring back fireworks displays, authorities are trying to discourage amateurs from filling the vacuum. REIDY: I word to anyone who's thinking about a backyard firework show, don't. Fireworks are illegal in Massachusetts and dangerous in untrained hands. SERRIE: To discourage crowds in Florida, the Blue Angels announced they will not fly at the Pensacola Beach Air Show and Airbnb announced its banning parties in regions with public health mandates against large gatherings including the Sunshine State which set a new state record for new COVID cases on Thursday. BREN BREIT, SPOKESMAN, AIRBNB: What we and the Florida surgeon general really want -- you know, potential travelers to know is that we need to be prioritizing safe and responsible travel and that really means no parties. SERRIE: Public health officials are trying to discourage a repeat of large Memorial Day gatherings which they say contributed to a dramatic surge in COVID-19 cases that appeared in the following weeks. Even in the great outdoors, officials urged caution as larger than usual numbers are expected a popular natural attractions such as the American River in California. SGT. RANDY BICKEL, PARK RANGER, SACRAMENTO COUNTY: We're going to do our best to keep educating people. Please ask them to wear masks, ask them to social distance and try to respect to other people's space. SERRIE: In North Carolina which today reported its highest number of hospitalizations in new cases. Officials are framing mask wearing as more than just an issue of public health. DR. MANDY COHEN, SECRETARY, NORTH CAROLINA HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES: Wear a face covering because you want to reignite the economy and support businesses. Wear a face covering so our children can be back at school. (END VIDEOTAPE) SERRIE: And today Kansas and Texas began requiring people to wear face masks in public joining 20 states with similar mandates. But other states such as Georgia are hoping that voluntary appeals will be enough to encourage people to do the right thing, Mike. EMANUEL: Jonathan Serrie live in Atlanta. Jonathan, thanks a lot. For more on the coronavirus pandemic, joining me now is Fox News Contributor Dr. Janette Nesheiwat. Doctor, it's great to have you. DR. JANETTE NESHEIWAT, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Thank you. EMANUEL: We've seen some of the COVID-19 hot spots closed down, beaches and parks this Independence Day weekend, is that wise? NESHEIWAT: Well, yes, there's an area of an outbreak for example in Miami, certain parts of Arizona, certain parts of Texas because the concern is close people in high density crowd clusters, they can transmit the virus from one person to another. Now, the ocean or pools, they're safe, it's just that the condensed crowd is what -- is the concern for transmission of this virus. And you know, this Fourth of July holiday weekend has the potential for a perfect storm and with over 50,000 new cases daily and some hospitals maxing out their ICU capacity really need to take aggressive action and try to celebrate this holiday weekend at home so that we minimize person to person interaction with new people outside of your family. Really important of course in addition to that physical distancing. And if you are going to go out and celebrate, try to keep six to 10 feet and try to socialize outdoors and of course wear your masks. That's really important because the mask can help the transmission reduction from about 17 down to about three percent which can really save thousands of lives over the next few months. EMANUEL: As much of the country has reopened, there's been a real emphasis on those masks for Americans who have quarantined fatigue. How much of a difference does wearing a mask make when you're out and about? NESHEIWAT: Well, so, wearing a mask does not mean you should not practice physical distancing. The latest data that we have actually shows you're not only protecting others but you can actually be protecting yourself. And it also showed that by October, 33,000 lives would be saved. So it certainly helps, it's not 100 percent, that's why in addition to wearing your mask, physical distancing, hand hygiene, trying to avoid clusters crowds, areas with high density like bars and restaurants are really really important, especially because this virus potentially could be mutating to the point where it's three to nine times more transmissible, three to nine times more contagious. So that's really a big issue. So we have the tools and the knowledge and the power to fight and combat this virus, it's just a matter of compliance, being attentive and adhering to these CDC guidelines. EMANUEL: Doctor, in our final moments here, as you know young people think they're invincible. A final message to them heading into this Independence Day holiday weekend. NESHEIWAT: Be safe, be smart, we want to open up sooner than later. Remember, this virus can affect anyone from newborns, from children to senior citizens. And together we can all -- you know, protect one another and open up sooner than later. So really important to galvanize one another to do the right thing so that we could get back on our feet again. And remember, sometimes it's just safer to act as if we are all asymptomatic carriers and get back on our feet again. EMANUEL: And finally, is it smart to watch the fireworks from home? Perhaps look up in the sky or perhaps even on T.V.? NESHEIWAT: Yes, definitely a safer alternative because of your outdoors in close contact with one another, talking, shouting, screaming, you can transmit the virus, it can aerosolize and get into the nose, the mouth and the eyes of other people and definitely you can acquire the virus that way. So any opportunity we have to protect ourselves, to protect one another, we should certainly take that opportunity. EMANUEL: Dr. Janette Nesheiwat, wishing you a safe and healthy Independence Day weekend. Thanks for your time. NESHEIWAT: Thank you. Thank you, Mike, you too. EMANUEL: The Washington Redskins announced a thorough review of their name amid public pressure from major sponsors like Nike and FedEx. Correspondent David Spunt is following that story. Good evening, David. DAVID SPUNT, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Hi Mike, good evening to you. Even talk of a name change has been a long time coming when it comes to this team as you mentioned, the top draft with the Washington Redskins just conducting a review. No final decisions have been made at this point but the wheel started really moving yesterday when fed out -- FedEx, excuse me, put out an incredibly direct statement to all of the fans across the country and to the team management. I want to read it to you, it says, we have communicated to the team in Washington our request that they change the team name. Mike, that single sentence got Redskins owner Daniel Snyder's attention. FedEx owns the naming rights for the team's stadium. Now this request comes just a day after Adweek reported that 87 investment firms and shareholders sent a letter urging Nike, Pepsi, and FedEx to stop doing business with the team until that team name changes. Now, go to the Nike site if you want to try to buy something Redskins related, you can't. The company took all Redskins merchandise off the site until there is a name change. The name change isn't just important to people who are fans of the team last October when the Redskins played the Vikings' demonstrators in Minneapolis marched against the team name. Owner Dan Snyder released a statement this week quote, this process allows the team to take into account not only the proud tradition and history of the franchise but also input from our alumni, the organization, sponsors, the National Football League and the local community. It is proud to represent on and off the field. Quite a far cry Mike, from Snyder's comments to USA Today seven years ago where he said, quote, we'll never change the name. It's that simple. Never. You can use caps. The new head coach, Ron Rivera who was previously in Charlotte said, quote, this issue is of personal importance to me and I look forward to working closely with Dan Snyder to make sure we continue the mission of honoring and supporting our -- supporting Native Americans and our military. Now, online like a lot of people are talking about different names, suggesting different names to the team. One of those names you can expect not to see, the Braves, that's the original name for the team but NFL leader Roger Goodell said he is supportive if the team wants to change its name, Mike. EMANUEL: David Spunt reporting live. David, thanks a lot. In our Democracy 2020 report, former Vice President Joe Biden is expected to announce his own V.P. choice in early August. Biden has narrowed the list by saying it will be a woman. Correspondent Jacqui Heinrich looks at some of the candidates. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JACQUI HEINRICH, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Conventional wisdom among people who study gender and politics says former Vice President Joe Biden will likely pick a woman of color as his running mate, most likely a black woman. The country's demanding diversity at the table but also that move may motivate a key voting black, black woman who voted at the highest rates of any racial and gender group in the 2008 and 2012 elections. LORI COX HAN, PROFESSOR OF POLITICAL SCIENCE, CHAPMAN UNIVERSITY: Normally running mates, we don't help that much. I mean, there's no real political science data that says that they do, but then 2020 is a whole different ball game. HEINRICH: Experts consider Senator Kamala Harris the top pick vetted on a national stage. In her own presidential campaign, she brings legislative and law enforcement experience despite progressive criticism of her record as attorney general. (INAUDIBLE) Florida Congresswoman Val Demings, a former police chief from a swing state also drew national attention during the Black Lives Matter protest and in her roles in impeachment manager. Other picks like Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms and Stacey Abrams, lack federal experience but California Congresswoman Karen Bass has it, past praise of Fidel Castro could hurt her with Florida voters. And Susan Rice, Obama's former national security advisor would add to Biden's foreign policy know-how. Biden has not committed to choosing a black woman but experts say the choice will reflect the future of the party. There's a chance Progressives get left behind. Senator Elizabeth Warren's in the running, but she's white and older. KELLY DITTMAR, RUTGERS UNIVERSITY: I don't think she would lose a lot of voters but I think there would be also a level of disappointment and concern about, OK, where Joe Biden are you going to make sure our voices are at this table? HEINRICH: With other woman of color offering perspective and experience like Senator Tammy Duckworth an Asian-American combat veteran, experts think it's unlikely white woman on the short list will make the cut. (END VIDEOTAPE) HEINRICH: Experts believe the main driver in Biden's choice is unifying the Democratic Party, Mike. EMANUEL: Jacqui Heinrich in New York. Jackie, thanks a lot. Ghislaine Maxwell is behind bars in charge with helping Jeffrey Epstein sexually exploit and abuse multiple minor girls. One woman says when she was 14 years old, Maxwell recruited and raped her. The victim who has asked remain anonymous spoke with Fox News. Correspondent Bryan Llenas has this report that you may find disturbing. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: She is just as evil as Jeffrey Epstein. BRYAN LLENAS, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: For the first time, a woman who wishes to conceal her identity is speaking publicly alleging Ghislaine Maxwell begins sexually abusing her in 1991 when she was just 14 years old. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: She did rape me. I would say it's more than 20 or 30 times. She is a rapist. Destroyed my what was supposed to be the best years of my life being a teenager, being a cheerleader. LLENAS: She claims Maxwell would abuse her with Epstein and sometimes alone coaching her, have her to have sex with men. The abuse stopped when she was 16, after became pregnant with Epstein's baby, and had to have an abortion. Her attacker grew fearful she would tell her grandparents or the authorities, but for good measure, she says she was gang-raped one last time as punishment. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Ghislaine was a part of it and Jeffrey Epstein's a part of it, and I was drugged. Gang-raped and left on the lawn and they put a gun to me. And the man that drove me home said I would never be (INAUDIBLE), I never come back alive if I spoke about it. LLENAS: Jane Doe's legal team is researching whether she can pursue criminal charges, but she is willing to serve as a witness against Maxwell in her upcoming trial. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Absolutely, I would definitely take a stand and testify. JORDAN MERSON, ATTORNEY FOR MAXWELL'S ALLEGED VICTIM: People felt, you know, cheated when Mr. Epstein committed suicide in prison and they didn't get a chance to sit in the courtroom and see the judicial system play out. And they're hoping that there's a different result here. (END VIDEOTAPE) LLENAS: According to her attorney, Jane Doe's grandparents have corroborated her claims. When asked about these specific allegations, an attorney for Ghislaine Maxwell, said, \"no comment.\" Mike? EMANUEL: Bryan Llenas, thanks very much. Up next, to look back at lessons learned from racial tensions in the 1960s, and why they were rejected by the Democratic president. First, here is what some of our Fox affiliates around the country are covering tonight. FOX 10 in Phoenix, where police say a man robbing a gas station convenience store fatally shot a bystander. The robber turned shooter, then was killed in a Wild West shootout with another bystander who was injured in the exchange of gunfire. None of those involved was immediately identified. FOX 29 in Philadelphia, reporting on Major League Baseball announcing they've had 38 positive COVID-19 tests as training resumes. 31 players and seven staff are infected, spread across 19 teams. Opening day has been rescheduled for July 23rd. And this is a live look at Denver from Fox 31. One of the big stories there tonight, Colorado joins New Jersey and New Hampshire in allowing legal betting on Nathan's Famous Hot Dog Eating Contest for the first time in the event's history. The July 4th tradition will take place at an undisclosed private location with social distancing measures in place rather than Coney Island, New York. That's tonight's live look \"OUTSIDE THE BELTWAY\" from SPECIAL REPORT. We'll be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) EMANUEL: In the mid to late 1960s, riders rampaged through many American cities. At that time, the Kerner Commission comprised of blacks and whites, Liberals and Conservatives was established to look into the unrest. The group's conclusions were roundly rejected by the country's Democratic president. Since then, history has repeated itself time and again. Correspondent Douglas Kennedy, reports on the Commission's predictions and talks to its last surviving member. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DOUGLAS KENNEDY, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: This is all really familiar. JOHN KOSKINEN, FORMER COMMISSIONER, INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE: Yes, this is a scene that, unfortunately, has been repeated many times in the past. KENNEDY: Detroit 1967, Los Angeles 1992, Ferguson 2014, everywhere 2020. For some, it's the same thing all over again. John Koskinen doesn't want to say I told you so. But back in 1968, he worked for a commission that predicted it all. So, the Kerner Commission was actually the first time the U.S. government identified racial inequality and institutionalized racism as the root cause of urban social unrest. KOSKINEN: That's right and that's why it was so controversial at the time. KENNEDY: It's most famous passage warned, \"Our nation is moving toward two societies, one black, one white, separate and unequal.\" They were conclusions that irritated then-President Lyndon Johnson, who wanted the commission to conclude that outside groups were the problem, organizing protests for nefarious political purpose. FRED HARRIS, FORMER SENATOR OF OKLAHOMA: President Johnson himself, unfortunately, believed that there was some conspiracy behind these riots or disorders. He thought that they were organized. And we found that, that was simply not true. KENNEDY: Former Oklahoma senator, Fred Harris is the last surviving member of the actual commission. HARRIS: Now, that police have become more and more militarized, more and more separated from the community where they're supposed to protect and serve. KENNEDY: The Kerner Commission concluded that racism was everyone's problem and that racial inequality would never be solved unless everyone came together to solve it. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: No justice! UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No peace! UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: No peace! KENNEDY: It's a sentiment, Koskinen, says is apparent as much today as it was back then. But today's protests are actually giving you a little bit of hope. KOSKINEN: Well, yes. Because I think what people have been able to see is visible representations of the difficulties African Americans have in a day to day basis in their relationship with the white superstructure but certainly with the police. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: What I want? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: (INAUDIBLE) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (INAUDIBLE) KENNEDY: Both he and Harris say we have a chance now to finally address these generation's old problems. And they say we better take advantage of it. Just outside Lafayette Square in Washington, D.C., Douglas Kennedy, Fox News. (END VIDEOTAPE) EMANUEL: Up next, we hear from some World War II veterans ahead of the Independence Day weekend. First, \"BEYOND OUR BORDERS\" tonight. At least four people are dead and nearly 100 injured after an explosion at a fireworks factory in northwestern Turkey. At least three people are unaccounted for, efforts to control the fire were hampered by continuing explosions. The cause is unknown at this point. Botswana is launching an investigation after 275 elephant carcasses have been found in recent weeks. Poaching which is a problem and the country has been ruled out as the cause. Wildlife officials are using aircraft to better understand the mysterious loss of life. COVID-19 is considered an unlikely candidate, but for now, nothing including poison has been ruled out. The USS Dwight D. Eisenhower has now spent 169 straight days at sea, a record for an American warship. The nuclear-powered aircraft carrier is currently in the Arabian Sea. Just some of the other stories \"BEYOND OUR BORDERS\" tonight. We'll be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) EMANUEL: The Fourth of July marks one moment of independence for America, but the fight for freedom did not end in the 1700s. Through many wars, political debates, and centuries, the fight is continued. With assistance from National Geographic, my colleague Brett Baier, looks back at the greatest generation who helped win World War II, 75 years ago. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BRET BAIER, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: They are among the last surviving voices of the Second World War. HARRY STEWART, VETERAN, WORLD WAR II: I never thought that I'd have the chance to actually train and become a pilot. But World War II came along. VICTOR GREGG, VETERAN, WORLD WAR II: Every word I'm going to tell you, there's no make-believe or anything. And whether you acknowledge it or not, it's going to be the truth. BAIER: The stories of these two veterans and others are chronicled in National Geographic's coverage of the 75th anniversary of the end of World War II, in their June 2020 issue. That quarter-century milestone is being celebrated across the globe. From a military parade in Moscow's Red Square to celebrate the victory over Nazi Germany to multiple commemorations this year at D.C.'s memorial to the war on the National Mall. The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs estimates that about 300,000 American World War II veterans are still alive, yet with that number declining every year, capturing their stories is more critical than ever. Harry Stewart served with the Tuskegee Airman. Just 10 of the famed Tuskegee Airman remain today. STEWART: I just felt as though I was meant to be in an airplane. I got so if felt as though the aircraft was an extension of my body. I felt as though my arms were the wings. BAIER: He says he wants the Tuskegee Airmen to be remembered as good citizens who helped protect their country during a time of need, even in the face of discrimination. STEWART: It was quite a thing because people wondered, well, these guys had been segregated all the time. And how do they fly? Are they good pilots? The answer is, yes. BAIER: After postwar budget cuts forced Stewart out of the Air Force, he was denied a position as a commercial pilot with Pan American and Transworld Airlines because of his race. STEWART: When I got out of the service, I applied with a couple of airlines as a pilot, and I was denied being accepted because of my color. So I went back to school, and I got my degree in mechanical engineering. As the years passed, I would go to the airport there, and I'd look in the cockpit, and lo and behold there's an African-Americans sitting behind the controls there ready to fly the aircraft. And the one that truly brought tears to my face was when not one, but there were two African-Americans sitting in the cockpit theare. They were both women. So, that was quite a thing. BAIER: For Victor Gregg, an offer of a hot of tea lured him to a recruiting office in London where he signed up for the British Army on his 18th birthday. Serving as a rifleman, his name was pulled out of a hat to join a parachute brigade. He says they received their training for that task while on the job. VICTOR GREGG, WORLD WAR II VETERAN: Consequently, when we jumped, we lost more people on the descent in the first hour that we lost through the six days of the fight. Out of the 460 who jumped, there's only about 180, I think. All the rest were dead. And they was jumping on the dead bodies of the blokes who had jumped the day before. BAIER: Both men say they served out of a sense of duty to their countries. GREGG: My attitude of the war was that's what we're supposed to do. If the Colonel told us to do anything, we done it. If he says we're here to stay, that's it. We made the best of it. STEWART: I'm a strong patriot. I feel this is nothing like the Constitution that we have of the United States, which is the most beautiful document anybody could ever read. The practice of it is not perfect, it's not perfect today, it may not be perfect tomorrow, but it keeps getting closer and closer and closer right on out to infinity. BAIER: In Washington, Bret Baier, FOX News. (END VIDEOTAPE) MIKE EMANUEL, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: President Trump pushes ahead with July 4th festivities despite spiking virus numbers and a warning from health officials. The panel is next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, (R) PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We're going to Mount Rushmore, Mount Rushmore is in great shape, and it's going to be in great shape for centuries to come. We are looking forward to it. I'll be making a speech there. I'll be seeing a lot of people, a lot of different people. If you look at what's going on, if you look at the numbers all over, I think we're going to have a very strong V-shape. DR. JEROME ADAMS, U.S. SURGEON GENERAL: Every single person has to make up their own mind. There are going to be people going to beaches, going to barbecues, going to different environments, and they have to look at their individual risk. As you mentioned, CDC says larger gatherings are a higher risk. The most important thing I would say to people as if you do go out to a gathering or in public, please weare a face covering. (END VIDEO CLIP) EMANUEL: President Trump making his way to Mount Rushmore. We can give you a live look there courtesy of the White House of the scene, folks waiting for the arrival of Air Force One, and President Trump and senior administration officials are telling us the president is going to talk about on the anniversary of America's founding, he will tell the truth about America's histories and tell the truth about those trying to tear it down and divide our country. Key points the president is expected to make, America is a great and virtuous country. If we tear down our history we will not be able to understand ourselves or America's destiny. And they add he will say the leftwing mob and those practicing cancel culture are engaging in totalitarian behavior that is completely alien to American life, and we must not accept it. With that, let's bring in our panel, Byron York, chief political correspondent for the \"Washington Examiner,\" Julie Pace is the Washington Bureau Chief for the Associated Press, and \"Washington Post\" columnist Marc Thiessen. Panel, welcome. Byron, your thoughts and the themes the president is going to strike tonight. BRYON YORK, CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, \"WASHINGTON EXAMINER\": Well, one of the themes he's apparently going to talk about essentially is law and order in this time of unrest. And he's been inconsistent in the way he has dealt with that disorder across the country and really needs to develop a consistent position. How many people have watched as crowds tried to tear down or tore down a statue in a number of cities across the country, and their first thought was, where at the police? And the president himself almost allowed a mob to take down the statue of Andrew Jackson in Lafayette Park right in front of the White House. The president actually needs to get a stronger, more consistent position on that, and make clear where he stands on all of this. EMANUEL: Julie, we are four months to the day from Election Day. Obviously, President Trump misses the opportunity to get out and speak to his crowds. He's going to Mount Rushmore tonight. Your thoughts? JULIE PACE, WASHINGTON BUREAU CHIEF, ASSOCIATED PRESS: In talking to a lot of Republicans this week, there was a hope that the president four months from Election Day would be trying to reach out to some of those disaffected Republicans, some of those independents who don't necessarily see the president reflecting their views, their concerns about the public health crisis, about the economy. And instead, I think what we're going to see tonight is a president who is really meaning into the message that his base wants to hear. He sees this election as one where he can win if his base turns out in really large numbers, and I think he is signaling to those, again, Republicans who I've talked to this week who would like to see him just ever so slightly reach out to those independents that this is, again, going to be a campaign that is really targeted toward that base. EMANUEL: We have the luxury of having a former White House speech writer on the panel tonight, so Marc, your thoughts on the themes going into tonight's big event? MARC THIESSEN, AMERICAN ENTERPRISE INSTITUTE: If I was advising the president, what I would tell him to do is quote Dr. Martin Luther King. Dr. Martin Luther King actually rejected the principles of the 1619 project and the idea that America's founding was inherently racist. And I would encourage him and, quite frankly, anyone today over the a Fourth of July weekend to go back and read the \"I have a Dream\" speech, because Martin Luther King embraced the principles of the American founding. He said that we need to live up to those principles. I want to give you a section of it. He said, \"In a sense, we have come to our nation's capital to cash a check. When the architects of our republic wrote the magnificent words of the Constitution and the Declaration, they were signing a promissory note to which every American was to fall heir. That note was a promise to all men, yes, black men as well as white men would be guaranteed unalienable rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. And we've come to cash that check.\" This is the opposite message of the Black Lives Matter movement. What Martin Luther King was saying was not that just racism was unfair, racism is un-American. The Black Lives Matter movement is saying that the opposite of it, that basically racism is as American as apple pie, that it's baked into our system, and that is a message that Martin Luther King absolutely rejected. EMANUEL: A big difference form last Fourth of July to this year when we had massive crowds on the National Mall in the rain to hear the president speak, as of course, COVID-19. Here is Dr. Anthony Fauci sounding the alarm. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES: \u00a0I think the data is showing that there is a single mutation that actually makes the virus be able to replicate better and maybe have high viral loads. It just seems that the virus replicates better and may be more transmissible. But this is still at the stage of trying to confirm that. But some very good viral geneticists are working on that right now. (END VIDEO CLIP) EMANUEL: Four months out from Election Day, Byron, what are the COVID-19 concerns? YORK: They're real, and they're growing, although there's a different characteristic to this wave of the disease in the sense that there are better treatments for it, no doubt about that. Politically, part of the big problem of the president's rally in Tulsa was that he held a large gathering indoors. And that is really the highest risk of transmission. The think about the Mount Rushmore event is that perhaps there won't be a lot of social distancing, perhaps not everybody will wear a mask, but it will be outdoors, which is a much better idea. And the president took a lot of criticism for that, holding the rally indoors in Tulsa. Now, it would be perhaps comparable to a lot of the protests that we've seen across the country, most of which were also outdoors. EMANUEL: Julie, from the White House video, it looks like a great crowd there at Mount Rushmore. Your thoughts heading into the event tonight with the COVID-19 concerns? PACE: I think one of the challenges for the president right now is he so clearly wants to move past the pandemic. He really wants to focus on the economy. He wants this to be behind us, but it's not. And so he has this challenge as he addresses that crowd, as he talks to the nation over the next several months is to not look as though he is ignoring what is happening in a lot states. A lot of the states that we are talking about right now where we do see cases on the rise are battleground states, states where the president has to win if he wants a second term. And I do think that he has a lot of advisors around him who want him to address what's happening there. EMANUEL: Next up, the Friday Lightning Round, the debate over renaming the Washington Redskins, vice presidential Candidate Casino, and this week's Winners and Losers. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: In the same way Redskins has evolved, and despite its history, it is now considered a slut. It's nothing to do with the sensitivities of a mass of people. It has to do with a decent, simple, elementary respect. You don't use that word if you can avoid it. (END VIDEO CLIP) EMANUEL: That was the late great Charles Krauthammer opining on the Redskins name change. Nearly seven years later the debate continues, and we're back with our panel, Byron, Julie, and Marc. Byron, so Daniel Snyder has gone from heck no, never, ever, to some major sponsors saying we are pulling our money, so now it's a maybe? YORK: Listen, it's going to happen. The idea of holding and making a study of this change is just a prelude to actually doing it. And the difference between now and what happened in the past is a change in corporate America. Not only is the NFL a giant business that is opposed to the name, by FedEx, the company which purchased the naming rights to the Redskins stadium now has made it very clear it wants the name changed. It would lose other sponsorships as well, so this is going to happen. EMANUEL: Julie, your thoughts? PACE: This isn't just public sentiment changing. There's been a lot of pressure on the Redskins for a lot of years to take this step. I think a lot of this is about money. When you start to lose sponsors, including the naming sponsor of your stadium, when they start to say we are not comfortable with this name, the ownership really, I don't think, has any choice moving forward. EMANUEL: And Marc, it sounds like a new name could be new merchandise and old gear could be retro, and so probably a lot of money to be made if you change, right? THIESSEN: Yes, well, this is being done for the woke mob, not for the Native-Americans. The \"Washington Post\" had a poll in 2016, 90 percent of Native-Americans are not offended by the Redskins name, 80 percent wouldn't be offended if you came up and called them a redskin to their face even if you were not a Native-American. So this is not being done for the Native- American. It's being done for the mob that is tearing down the statues and terrorizing the entire country. And you know what, they're coming after the Chicago Blackhawks and they're coming after the Atlanta Braves and they're coming after the Kansas City Chiefs next. So this is only the beginning. EMANUEL: Sorry, I got a little excited about Candidate Casino. Let's go there. All right, the Joe Biden Veep-stakes. Byron where is your money going? YORK: Look, I think the big question is whether the Democratic base will be happy with all-white ticket. My guess is they will not, so I'm still high on Kamala Harris with $40. If they're OK with that, Elizabeth Warren next with $20. Val Demings and Keisha Lance Bottoms with $15, and Tammy Duckworth, a possibility at $10. EMANUEL: Julie, where's your money going? PACE: I'm with Byron that I think there's a lot of focus on some of the African-American women who are in contention. I've got $40 on Kamala Harris who seems to be leading the pack right now, $20 on Val Demings, and $20 on Keisha Lance Bottoms, the mayor of Atlanta, $20 on Elizabeth Warren, though, still really hanging on and a favorite of a lot of liberals in the Democratic Party. EMANUEL: And Marc? THIESSEN: So I'm also agreeing with everybody it's probably going to be an African-American woman. I put 50 on the person who I think it should be, which is Val Demings because Joe Biden needs to reach both the base and the swing voters and get them both excited. Val Demings was an impeachment manager, she's an African-American, she's popular with the police, but she's also a former police chief, and that would strengthen Joe Biden's message that he's a moderate who is not for dismantling the police. I also put down $20 on Kamala Harris, $20 on Susan Rice, and $10 on Keisha Lance Bottoms. EMANUEL: All right, if it's Friday, that means it's time for Winners and Losers. Byron, you go. YORK: Winner is Janis Shinwari who for eight years was a translator for American troops in Afghanistan, credited with saving at least five American lives, all while being targeted by the Taliban, became a U.S. citizen this week, a very happy even for everyone involved. The loser is Ghislaine Maxwell, Jeffrey Epstein's girlfriend, procurer, close associate for years. Now she's been arrested, and we might finally learn more about what Epstein did with some of his very rich and very powerful friends. EMANUEL: Let's go to Julie, winners and losers? PACE: So my winner this week is the Biden campaign. All the polls are moving in the direction, big fundraising week. Of course, you don't want to be the winner in July. You want to be the winner in November, so a lot of time to go in that race. My loser, fireworks. I love fireworks. Cancelled across so much of the country this holiday weekend. EMANUEL: Marc, take it away. THIESSEN: My winner is the U.S. economy, creating 4.8 million jobs in the last month. That's 20 times -- that's not only a record. That's 20 times the normal rate in an expansion. We're going to have 20 to 30 percent economic growth. Donald Trump is going to be riding a big economic wave into the reelection campaign. And my loser Joe Biden because he was downplaying the good economic news. America has been through so much. We've been through race riots, we've been through a pandemic, we've been through the worst economy since the Great Depression, and we get some good news, and Joe Biden says don't celebrate. Give me a break. EMANUEL: All right, panel, thanks very much, an action-packed week. When we come back, this week's \"Notable Quotables.\" (COMMERCIAL BREAK) EMANUEL: Finally tonight, it is Friday, so that means this week's \"Notable Quotables.\" (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, (R) PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: If you don't have confidence, you're not going to do very well. MAYOR BILL DE BLASIO, (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: The vast majority of New Yorkers want safety, and they want respect from NYPD officers. They don't want to see any bias, and we're going to strike that balance, and I think this budget helps us do it. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Let's mark the date on the calendar and how long it's going to be before we'll have that conversation about New Yorkers crying out for more police. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Today we announced the arrest of one of the villains in this investigation. She had slithered away to a gorgeous property in New Hampshire. DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES: \u00a0The numbers speak for themselves. I'n very concerned and I'm not satisfied which what's going because we are going on the wrong direction. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: People need to treat this like a hurricane, a hurricane is coming to my community. TRUMP: I had asked a mask on, I sort of liked the way I looked. I looked like the Lone Ranger. JOE BIDEN, (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I can hardly wait to compare my cognitive capability to the cognitive capability of the man I'm running against. KAYLEIGH MCENANY, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: This president, I'll tell you, is the most informed person on planet earth when it comes to the threats that we face. MIKE POMPEO, SECRETARY OF STATE: There are many folks using the Taliban or who have used the Taliban over years and years and years as proxy forces. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Right? It don't smell right. TRUMP: Nobody is going to shatter the American dream. God bless America. (END VIDEO CLIP) EMANUEL: Amen. Another wild week in the world of news, and it's not over yet. President Trump will speak tonight from Mount Rushmore and 10:00 p.m. eastern time. We will of course have complete live coverage. Following that I will be back for \"FOX News at Night.\" Tomorrow, starting at 6:00 p.m. eastern right here on FOX News we will bring you President Trump's \"Salute to American\" celebration. And be sure to join me this Sunday when I sit in for Chris Wallace on \"FOX News Sunday.\" Among our guests, Labor Secretary Eugene Scalia. I'll also speak about the spike in coronavirus cases across the country with the director of the Harvard Global Health Institute, Dr. Ashish Jha. Thanks for inviting us into your home tonight.

I'm Mike Emanuel in for Bret Baier. President Trump is taking a quick trip to Mount Rushmore to watch some July third fireworks along with thousands of people. The event comes despite the U.S. reporting another record high in new coronavirus cases today. In his speech tonight, President Trump is expected to speak about the history of America and warned against those he sees trying to divide the country. We will have life coverage of the big event tonight at 10:00 p.m. Eastern. The president will return to Washington well past midnight to prepare for tomorrow's festivities back home at the White House. That's where we begin tonight with Correspondent Mark Meredith on the North Lawn. Good evening, Mark. MARK MEREDITH, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Good evening to you, Mike. At this hour, the president and first lady, they are in the air making their way to Mount Rushmore for that fireworks as you also mentioned, they'll be having a remarks tonight. While they are there in South Dakota, we expect the president is going to call out cancel culture and also criticize those that want to tear down monuments in the name of rewriting American history. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We're going to Mount Rushmore. MEREDITH: President Trump is kicking off his holiday weekend with a trip to South Dakota's Mount Rushmore where at least 75,000 people are expected to watch a fireworks extravaganza. TRUMP: I'll be seeing a lot of people, a lot of different people. And I think it will be a fantastic evening. MEREDITH: Organizers say masks will be provided but people won't be required to wear them. Meantime, some Native American tribes who calls South Dakota home are protesting the visit, they want Mount Rushmore torn down. The leader of the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe writing, we are the ones who live under the stare of those who have wronged us. On Saturday, the president will host a salute to America event. The White House inviting front-line workers including doctors and nurses to the celebration while tens of thousands are expected to gather on the National Mall for a military flyover and fireworks. Mall goers are encouraged to practice social distancing. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: CDC says larger gatherings are a higher risk. You have to take that into account again with whether or not you're at risk, whether you live with someone who is vulnerable and then you have to take measures to say safe. MEREDITH: As several states experience a surging COVID cases, Dr. Anthony Fauci says the virus itself may be mutating, essentially allowing it to spread more easily. But he says more research is needed to know for sure. DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES: It just seems that the virus replicates better and may be more transmissible, but this is still at the stage of trying to confirm that. MEREDITH: President Trump tweeted Thursday, the increase in cases is easy to explain, writing, quote, there's a rising coronavirus cases because our testing is so massive and so good. Far bigger and better than any other country. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Joe Biden can't fix our economy. MEREDITH: The president's campaign is focused elsewhere. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Trade deals that let China and Mexico steal our jobs. MEREDITH: The Trump campaign released this new T.V. ad today only hours after the June jobs report showed 4.8 million jobs were added last month. The ad maybe the most clear sign yet the Trump campaign hopes to win voters over by appealing directly to people's pocketbooks. (END VIDEOTAPE) MEREDITH: In his remarks tonight, the president expected to call America a great and virtuous country but he's also going to say some of the chaos that we've seen these last couple of weeks is a responsibility of a left- wing mob, Mike. EMANUEL: Mark Meredith leading us off on the North Lawn. Mark, many thanks. The way that spikes started in the South moved West, but now at least 40 states are seeing climbing new coronavirus cases. Governors have ordered the wearing of masks in public and families are being urged to celebrate Independence Day at home. Correspondent Jonathan Serrie is in Atlanta looking at the concerning coronavirus trends across the country. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) TERRENCE REIDY, UNDERSECRETARY, MASSACHUSETTS PUBLIC SAFETY: The virus isn't taking a holiday. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Feel pain anywhere? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No. JONATHAN SERRIE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: As the U.S. grapples with a new spike in COVID-19 cases, this July 4th promises to be like no other. With many cities canceling or scaring back fireworks displays, authorities are trying to discourage amateurs from filling the vacuum. REIDY: I word to anyone who's thinking about a backyard firework show, don't. Fireworks are illegal in Massachusetts and dangerous in untrained hands. SERRIE: To discourage crowds in Florida, the Blue Angels announced they will not fly at the Pensacola Beach Air Show and Airbnb announced its banning parties in regions with public health mandates against large gatherings including the Sunshine State which set a new state record for new COVID cases on Thursday. BREN BREIT, SPOKESMAN, AIRBNB: What we and the Florida surgeon general really want -- you know, potential travelers to know is that we need to be prioritizing safe and responsible travel and that really means no parties. SERRIE: Public health officials are trying to discourage a repeat of large Memorial Day gatherings which they say contributed to a dramatic surge in COVID-19 cases that appeared in the following weeks. Even in the great outdoors, officials urged caution as larger than usual numbers are expected a popular natural attractions such as the American River in California. SGT. RANDY BICKEL, PARK RANGER, SACRAMENTO COUNTY: We're going to do our best to keep educating people. Please ask them to wear masks, ask them to social distance and try to respect to other people's space. SERRIE: In North Carolina which today reported its highest number of hospitalizations in new cases. Officials are framing mask wearing as more than just an issue of public health. DR. MANDY COHEN, SECRETARY, NORTH CAROLINA HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES: Wear a face covering because you want to reignite the economy and support businesses. Wear a face covering so our children can be back at school. (END VIDEOTAPE) SERRIE: And today Kansas and Texas began requiring people to wear face masks in public joining 20 states with similar mandates. But other states such as Georgia are hoping that voluntary appeals will be enough to encourage people to do the right thing, Mike. EMANUEL: Jonathan Serrie live in Atlanta. Jonathan, thanks a lot. For more on the coronavirus pandemic, joining me now is Fox News Contributor Dr. Janette Nesheiwat. Doctor, it's great to have you. DR. JANETTE NESHEIWAT, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Thank you. EMANUEL: We've seen some of the COVID-19 hot spots closed down, beaches and parks this Independence Day weekend, is that wise? NESHEIWAT: Well, yes, there's an area of an outbreak for example in Miami, certain parts of Arizona, certain parts of Texas because the concern is close people in high density crowd clusters, they can transmit the virus from one person to another. Now, the ocean or pools, they're safe, it's just that the condensed crowd is what -- is the concern for transmission of this virus. And you know, this Fourth of July holiday weekend has the potential for a perfect storm and with over 50,000 new cases daily and some hospitals maxing out their ICU capacity really need to take aggressive action and try to celebrate this holiday weekend at home so that we minimize person to person interaction with new people outside of your family. Really important of course in addition to that physical distancing. And if you are going to go out and celebrate, try to keep six to 10 feet and try to socialize outdoors and of course wear your masks. That's really important because the mask can help the transmission reduction from about 17 down to about three percent which can really save thousands of lives over the next few months. EMANUEL: As much of the country has reopened, there's been a real emphasis on those masks for Americans who have quarantined fatigue. How much of a difference does wearing a mask make when you're out and about? NESHEIWAT: Well, so, wearing a mask does not mean you should not practice physical distancing. The latest data that we have actually shows you're not only protecting others but you can actually be protecting yourself. And it also showed that by October, 33,000 lives would be saved. So it certainly helps, it's not 100 percent, that's why in addition to wearing your mask, physical distancing, hand hygiene, trying to avoid clusters crowds, areas with high density like bars and restaurants are really really important, especially because this virus potentially could be mutating to the point where it's three to nine times more transmissible, three to nine times more contagious. So that's really a big issue. So we have the tools and the knowledge and the power to fight and combat this virus, it's just a matter of compliance, being attentive and adhering to these CDC guidelines. EMANUEL: Doctor, in our final moments here, as you know young people think they're invincible. A final message to them heading into this Independence Day holiday weekend. NESHEIWAT: Be safe, be smart, we want to open up sooner than later. Remember, this virus can affect anyone from newborns, from children to senior citizens. And together we can all -- you know, protect one another and open up sooner than later. So really important to galvanize one another to do the right thing so that we could get back on our feet again. And remember, sometimes it's just safer to act as if we are all asymptomatic carriers and get back on our feet again. EMANUEL: And finally, is it smart to watch the fireworks from home? Perhaps look up in the sky or perhaps even on T.V.? NESHEIWAT: Yes, definitely a safer alternative because of your outdoors in close contact with one another, talking, shouting, screaming, you can transmit the virus, it can aerosolize and get into the nose, the mouth and the eyes of other people and definitely you can acquire the virus that way. So any opportunity we have to protect ourselves, to protect one another, we should certainly take that opportunity. EMANUEL: Dr. Janette Nesheiwat, wishing you a safe and healthy Independence Day weekend. Thanks for your time. NESHEIWAT: Thank you. Thank you, Mike, you too. EMANUEL: The Washington Redskins announced a thorough review of their name amid public pressure from major sponsors like Nike and FedEx. Correspondent David Spunt is following that story. Good evening, David. DAVID SPUNT, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Hi Mike, good evening to you. Even talk of a name change has been a long time coming when it comes to this team as you mentioned, the top draft with the Washington Redskins just conducting a review. No final decisions have been made at this point but the wheel started really moving yesterday when fed out -- FedEx, excuse me, put out an incredibly direct statement to all of the fans across the country and to the team management. I want to read it to you, it says, we have communicated to the team in Washington our request that they change the team name. Mike, that single sentence got Redskins owner Daniel Snyder's attention. FedEx owns the naming rights for the team's stadium. Now this request comes just a day after Adweek reported that 87 investment firms and shareholders sent a letter urging Nike, Pepsi, and FedEx to stop doing business with the team until that team name changes. Now, go to the Nike site if you want to try to buy something Redskins related, you can't. The company took all Redskins merchandise off the site until there is a name change. The name change isn't just important to people who are fans of the team last October when the Redskins played the Vikings' demonstrators in Minneapolis marched against the team name. Owner Dan Snyder released a statement this week quote, this process allows the team to take into account not only the proud tradition and history of the franchise but also input from our alumni, the organization, sponsors, the National Football League and the local community. It is proud to represent on and off the field. Quite a far cry Mike, from Snyder's comments to USA Today seven years ago where he said, quote, we'll never change the name. It's that simple. Never. You can use caps. The new head coach, Ron Rivera who was previously in Charlotte said, quote, this issue is of personal importance to me and I look forward to working closely with Dan Snyder to make sure we continue the mission of honoring and supporting our -- supporting Native Americans and our military. Now, online like a lot of people are talking about different names, suggesting different names to the team. One of those names you can expect not to see, the Braves, that's the original name for the team but NFL leader Roger Goodell said he is supportive if the team wants to change its name, Mike. EMANUEL: David Spunt reporting live. David, thanks a lot. In our Democracy 2020 report, former Vice President Joe Biden is expected to announce his own V.P. choice in early August. Biden has narrowed the list by saying it will be a woman. Correspondent Jacqui Heinrich looks at some of the candidates. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JACQUI HEINRICH, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Conventional wisdom among people who study gender and politics says former Vice President Joe Biden will likely pick a woman of color as his running mate, most likely a black woman. The country's demanding diversity at the table but also that move may motivate a key voting black, black woman who voted at the highest rates of any racial and gender group in the 2008 and 2012 elections. LORI COX HAN, PROFESSOR OF POLITICAL SCIENCE, CHAPMAN UNIVERSITY: Normally running mates, we don't help that much. I mean, there's no real political science data that says that they do, but then 2020 is a whole different ball game. HEINRICH: Experts consider Senator Kamala Harris the top pick vetted on a national stage. In her own presidential campaign, she brings legislative and law enforcement experience despite progressive criticism of her record as attorney general. (INAUDIBLE) Florida Congresswoman Val Demings, a former police chief from a swing state also drew national attention during the Black Lives Matter protest and in her roles in impeachment manager. Other picks like Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms and Stacey Abrams, lack federal experience but California Congresswoman Karen Bass has it, past praise of Fidel Castro could hurt her with Florida voters. And Susan Rice, Obama's former national security advisor would add to Biden's foreign policy know-how. Biden has not committed to choosing a black woman but experts say the choice will reflect the future of the party. There's a chance Progressives get left behind. Senator Elizabeth Warren's in the running, but she's white and older. KELLY DITTMAR, RUTGERS UNIVERSITY: I don't think she would lose a lot of voters but I think there would be also a level of disappointment and concern about, OK, where Joe Biden are you going to make sure our voices are at this table? HEINRICH: With other woman of color offering perspective and experience like Senator Tammy Duckworth an Asian-American combat veteran, experts think it's unlikely white woman on the short list will make the cut. (END VIDEOTAPE) HEINRICH: Experts believe the main driver in Biden's choice is unifying the Democratic Party, Mike. EMANUEL: Jacqui Heinrich in New York. Jackie, thanks a lot. Ghislaine Maxwell is behind bars in charge with helping Jeffrey Epstein sexually exploit and abuse multiple minor girls. One woman says when she was 14 years old, Maxwell recruited and raped her. The victim who has asked remain anonymous spoke with Fox News. Correspondent Bryan Llenas has this report that you may find disturbing. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: She is just as evil as Jeffrey Epstein. BRYAN LLENAS, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: For the first time, a woman who wishes to conceal her identity is speaking publicly alleging Ghislaine Maxwell begins sexually abusing her in 1991 when she was just 14 years old. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: She did rape me. I would say it's more than 20 or 30 times. She is a rapist. Destroyed my what was supposed to be the best years of my life being a teenager, being a cheerleader. LLENAS: She claims Maxwell would abuse her with Epstein and sometimes alone coaching her, have her to have sex with men. The abuse stopped when she was 16, after became pregnant with Epstein's baby, and had to have an abortion. Her attacker grew fearful she would tell her grandparents or the authorities, but for good measure, she says she was gang-raped one last time as punishment. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Ghislaine was a part of it and Jeffrey Epstein's a part of it, and I was drugged. Gang-raped and left on the lawn and they put a gun to me. And the man that drove me home said I would never be (INAUDIBLE), I never come back alive if I spoke about it. LLENAS: Jane Doe's legal team is researching whether she can pursue criminal charges, but she is willing to serve as a witness against Maxwell in her upcoming trial. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Absolutely, I would definitely take a stand and testify. JORDAN MERSON, ATTORNEY FOR MAXWELL'S ALLEGED VICTIM: People felt, you know, cheated when Mr. Epstein committed suicide in prison and they didn't get a chance to sit in the courtroom and see the judicial system play out. And they're hoping that there's a different result here. (END VIDEOTAPE) LLENAS: According to her attorney, Jane Doe's grandparents have corroborated her claims. When asked about these specific allegations, an attorney for Ghislaine Maxwell, said, \"no comment.\" Mike? EMANUEL: Bryan Llenas, thanks very much. Up next, to look back at lessons learned from racial tensions in the 1960s, and why they were rejected by the Democratic president. First, here is what some of our Fox affiliates around the country are covering tonight. FOX 10 in Phoenix, where police say a man robbing a gas station convenience store fatally shot a bystander. The robber turned shooter, then was killed in a Wild West shootout with another bystander who was injured in the exchange of gunfire. None of those involved was immediately identified. FOX 29 in Philadelphia, reporting on Major League Baseball announcing they've had 38 positive COVID-19 tests as training resumes. 31 players and seven staff are infected, spread across 19 teams. Opening day has been rescheduled for July 23rd. And this is a live look at Denver from Fox 31. One of the big stories there tonight, Colorado joins New Jersey and New Hampshire in allowing legal betting on Nathan's Famous Hot Dog Eating Contest for the first time in the event's history. The July 4th tradition will take place at an undisclosed private location with social distancing measures in place rather than Coney Island, New York. That's tonight's live look \"OUTSIDE THE BELTWAY\" from SPECIAL REPORT. We'll be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) EMANUEL: In the mid to late 1960s, riders rampaged through many American cities. At that time, the Kerner Commission comprised of blacks and whites, Liberals and Conservatives was established to look into the unrest. The group's conclusions were roundly rejected by the country's Democratic president. Since then, history has repeated itself time and again. Correspondent Douglas Kennedy, reports on the Commission's predictions and talks to its last surviving member. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DOUGLAS KENNEDY, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: This is all really familiar. JOHN KOSKINEN, FORMER COMMISSIONER, INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE: Yes, this is a scene that, unfortunately, has been repeated many times in the past. KENNEDY: Detroit 1967, Los Angeles 1992, Ferguson 2014, everywhere 2020. For some, it's the same thing all over again. John Koskinen doesn't want to say I told you so. But back in 1968, he worked for a commission that predicted it all. So, the Kerner Commission was actually the first time the U.S. government identified racial inequality and institutionalized racism as the root cause of urban social unrest. KOSKINEN: That's right and that's why it was so controversial at the time. KENNEDY: It's most famous passage warned, \"Our nation is moving toward two societies, one black, one white, separate and unequal.\" They were conclusions that irritated then-President Lyndon Johnson, who wanted the commission to conclude that outside groups were the problem, organizing protests for nefarious political purpose. FRED HARRIS, FORMER SENATOR OF OKLAHOMA: President Johnson himself, unfortunately, believed that there was some conspiracy behind these riots or disorders. He thought that they were organized. And we found that, that was simply not true. KENNEDY: Former Oklahoma senator, Fred Harris is the last surviving member of the actual commission. HARRIS: Now, that police have become more and more militarized, more and more separated from the community where they're supposed to protect and serve. KENNEDY: The Kerner Commission concluded that racism was everyone's problem and that racial inequality would never be solved unless everyone came together to solve it. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: No justice! UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No peace! UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: No peace! KENNEDY: It's a sentiment, Koskinen, says is apparent as much today as it was back then. But today's protests are actually giving you a little bit of hope. KOSKINEN: Well, yes. Because I think what people have been able to see is visible representations of the difficulties African Americans have in a day to day basis in their relationship with the white superstructure but certainly with the police. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: What I want? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: (INAUDIBLE) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (INAUDIBLE) KENNEDY: Both he and Harris say we have a chance now to finally address these generation's old problems. And they say we better take advantage of it. Just outside Lafayette Square in Washington, D.C., Douglas Kennedy, Fox News. (END VIDEOTAPE) EMANUEL: Up next, we hear from some World War II veterans ahead of the Independence Day weekend. First, \"BEYOND OUR BORDERS\" tonight. At least four people are dead and nearly 100 injured after an explosion at a fireworks factory in northwestern Turkey. At least three people are unaccounted for, efforts to control the fire were hampered by continuing explosions. The cause is unknown at this point. Botswana is launching an investigation after 275 elephant carcasses have been found in recent weeks. Poaching which is a problem and the country has been ruled out as the cause. Wildlife officials are using aircraft to better understand the mysterious loss of life. COVID-19 is considered an unlikely candidate, but for now, nothing including poison has been ruled out. The USS Dwight D. Eisenhower has now spent 169 straight days at sea, a record for an American warship. The nuclear-powered aircraft carrier is currently in the Arabian Sea. Just some of the other stories \"BEYOND OUR BORDERS\" tonight. We'll be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) EMANUEL: The Fourth of July marks one moment of independence for America, but the fight for freedom did not end in the 1700s. Through many wars, political debates, and centuries, the fight is continued. With assistance from National Geographic, my colleague Brett Baier, looks back at the greatest generation who helped win World War II, 75 years ago. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BRET BAIER, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: They are among the last surviving voices of the Second World War. HARRY STEWART, VETERAN, WORLD WAR II: I never thought that I'd have the chance to actually train and become a pilot. But World War II came along. VICTOR GREGG, VETERAN, WORLD WAR II: Every word I'm going to tell you, there's no make-believe or anything. And whether you acknowledge it or not, it's going to be the truth. BAIER: The stories of these two veterans and others are chronicled in National Geographic's coverage of the 75th anniversary of the end of World War II, in their June 2020 issue. That quarter-century milestone is being celebrated across the globe. From a military parade in Moscow's Red Square to celebrate the victory over Nazi Germany to multiple commemorations this year at D.C.'s memorial to the war on the National Mall. The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs estimates that about 300,000 American World War II veterans are still alive, yet with that number declining every year, capturing their stories is more critical than ever. Harry Stewart served with the Tuskegee Airman. Just 10 of the famed Tuskegee Airman remain today. STEWART: I just felt as though I was meant to be in an airplane. I got so if felt as though the aircraft was an extension of my body. I felt as though my arms were the wings. BAIER: He says he wants the Tuskegee Airmen to be remembered as good citizens who helped protect their country during a time of need, even in the face of discrimination. STEWART: It was quite a thing because people wondered, well, these guys had been segregated all the time. And how do they fly? Are they good pilots? The answer is, yes. BAIER: After postwar budget cuts forced Stewart out of the Air Force, he was denied a position as a commercial pilot with Pan American and Transworld Airlines because of his race. STEWART: When I got out of the service, I applied with a couple of airlines as a pilot, and I was denied being accepted because of my color. So I went back to school, and I got my degree in mechanical engineering. As the years passed, I would go to the airport there, and I'd look in the cockpit, and lo and behold there's an African-Americans sitting behind the controls there ready to fly the aircraft. And the one that truly brought tears to my face was when not one, but there were two African-Americans sitting in the cockpit theare. They were both women. So, that was quite a thing. BAIER: For Victor Gregg, an offer of a hot of tea lured him to a recruiting office in London where he signed up for the British Army on his 18th birthday. Serving as a rifleman, his name was pulled out of a hat to join a parachute brigade. He says they received their training for that task while on the job. VICTOR GREGG, WORLD WAR II VETERAN: Consequently, when we jumped, we lost more people on the descent in the first hour that we lost through the six days of the fight. Out of the 460 who jumped, there's only about 180, I think. All the rest were dead. And they was jumping on the dead bodies of the blokes who had jumped the day before. BAIER: Both men say they served out of a sense of duty to their countries. GREGG: My attitude of the war was that's what we're supposed to do. If the Colonel told us to do anything, we done it. If he says we're here to stay, that's it. We made the best of it. STEWART: I'm a strong patriot. I feel this is nothing like the Constitution that we have of the United States, which is the most beautiful document anybody could ever read. The practice of it is not perfect, it's not perfect today, it may not be perfect tomorrow, but it keeps getting closer and closer and closer right on out to infinity. BAIER: In Washington, Bret Baier, FOX News. (END VIDEOTAPE) MIKE EMANUEL, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: President Trump pushes ahead with July 4th festivities despite spiking virus numbers and a warning from health officials. The panel is next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, (R) PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We're going to Mount Rushmore, Mount Rushmore is in great shape, and it's going to be in great shape for centuries to come. We are looking forward to it. I'll be making a speech there. I'll be seeing a lot of people, a lot of different people. If you look at what's going on, if you look at the numbers all over, I think we're going to have a very strong V-shape. DR. JEROME ADAMS, U.S. SURGEON GENERAL: Every single person has to make up their own mind. There are going to be people going to beaches, going to barbecues, going to different environments, and they have to look at their individual risk. As you mentioned, CDC says larger gatherings are a higher risk. The most important thing I would say to people as if you do go out to a gathering or in public, please weare a face covering. (END VIDEO CLIP) EMANUEL: President Trump making his way to Mount Rushmore. We can give you a live look there courtesy of the White House of the scene, folks waiting for the arrival of Air Force One, and President Trump and senior administration officials are telling us the president is going to talk about on the anniversary of America's founding, he will tell the truth about America's histories and tell the truth about those trying to tear it down and divide our country. Key points the president is expected to make, America is a great and virtuous country. If we tear down our history we will not be able to understand ourselves or America's destiny. And they add he will say the leftwing mob and those practicing cancel culture are engaging in totalitarian behavior that is completely alien to American life, and we must not accept it. With that, let's bring in our panel, Byron York, chief political correspondent for the \"Washington Examiner,\" Julie Pace is the Washington Bureau Chief for the Associated Press, and \"Washington Post\" columnist Marc Thiessen. Panel, welcome. Byron, your thoughts and the themes the president is going to strike tonight. BRYON YORK, CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, \"WASHINGTON EXAMINER\": Well, one of the themes he's apparently going to talk about essentially is law and order in this time of unrest. And he's been inconsistent in the way he has dealt with that disorder across the country and really needs to develop a consistent position. How many people have watched as crowds tried to tear down or tore down a statue in a number of cities across the country, and their first thought was, where at the police? And the president himself almost allowed a mob to take down the statue of Andrew Jackson in Lafayette Park right in front of the White House. The president actually needs to get a stronger, more consistent position on that, and make clear where he stands on all of this. EMANUEL: Julie, we are four months to the day from Election Day. Obviously, President Trump misses the opportunity to get out and speak to his crowds. He's going to Mount Rushmore tonight. Your thoughts? JULIE PACE, WASHINGTON BUREAU CHIEF, ASSOCIATED PRESS: In talking to a lot of Republicans this week, there was a hope that the president four months from Election Day would be trying to reach out to some of those disaffected Republicans, some of those independents who don't necessarily see the president reflecting their views, their concerns about the public health crisis, about the economy. And instead, I think what we're going to see tonight is a president who is really meaning into the message that his base wants to hear. He sees this election as one where he can win if his base turns out in really large numbers, and I think he is signaling to those, again, Republicans who I've talked to this week who would like to see him just ever so slightly reach out to those independents that this is, again, going to be a campaign that is really targeted toward that base. EMANUEL: We have the luxury of having a former White House speech writer on the panel tonight, so Marc, your thoughts on the themes going into tonight's big event? MARC THIESSEN, AMERICAN ENTERPRISE INSTITUTE: If I was advising the president, what I would tell him to do is quote Dr. Martin Luther King. Dr. Martin Luther King actually rejected the principles of the 1619 project and the idea that America's founding was inherently racist. And I would encourage him and, quite frankly, anyone today over the a Fourth of July weekend to go back and read the \"I have a Dream\" speech, because Martin Luther King embraced the principles of the American founding. He said that we need to live up to those principles. I want to give you a section of it. He said, \"In a sense, we have come to our nation's capital to cash a check. When the architects of our republic wrote the magnificent words of the Constitution and the Declaration, they were signing a promissory note to which every American was to fall heir. That note was a promise to all men, yes, black men as well as white men would be guaranteed unalienable rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. And we've come to cash that check.\" This is the opposite message of the Black Lives Matter movement. What Martin Luther King was saying was not that just racism was unfair, racism is un-American. The Black Lives Matter movement is saying that the opposite of it, that basically racism is as American as apple pie, that it's baked into our system, and that is a message that Martin Luther King absolutely rejected. EMANUEL: A big difference form last Fourth of July to this year when we had massive crowds on the National Mall in the rain to hear the president speak, as of course, COVID-19. Here is Dr. Anthony Fauci sounding the alarm. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES: \u00a0I think the data is showing that there is a single mutation that actually makes the virus be able to replicate better and maybe have high viral loads. It just seems that the virus replicates better and may be more transmissible. But this is still at the stage of trying to confirm that. But some very good viral geneticists are working on that right now. (END VIDEO CLIP) EMANUEL: Four months out from Election Day, Byron, what are the COVID-19 concerns? YORK: They're real, and they're growing, although there's a different characteristic to this wave of the disease in the sense that there are better treatments for it, no doubt about that. Politically, part of the big problem of the president's rally in Tulsa was that he held a large gathering indoors. And that is really the highest risk of transmission. The think about the Mount Rushmore event is that perhaps there won't be a lot of social distancing, perhaps not everybody will wear a mask, but it will be outdoors, which is a much better idea. And the president took a lot of criticism for that, holding the rally indoors in Tulsa. Now, it would be perhaps comparable to a lot of the protests that we've seen across the country, most of which were also outdoors. EMANUEL: Julie, from the White House video, it looks like a great crowd there at Mount Rushmore. Your thoughts heading into the event tonight with the COVID-19 concerns? PACE: I think one of the challenges for the president right now is he so clearly wants to move past the pandemic. He really wants to focus on the economy. He wants this to be behind us, but it's not. And so he has this challenge as he addresses that crowd, as he talks to the nation over the next several months is to not look as though he is ignoring what is happening in a lot states. A lot of the states that we are talking about right now where we do see cases on the rise are battleground states, states where the president has to win if he wants a second term. And I do think that he has a lot of advisors around him who want him to address what's happening there. EMANUEL: Next up, the Friday Lightning Round, the debate over renaming the Washington Redskins, vice presidential Candidate Casino, and this week's Winners and Losers. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: In the same way Redskins has evolved, and despite its history, it is now considered a slut. It's nothing to do with the sensitivities of a mass of people. It has to do with a decent, simple, elementary respect. You don't use that word if you can avoid it. (END VIDEO CLIP) EMANUEL: That was the late great Charles Krauthammer opining on the Redskins name change. Nearly seven years later the debate continues, and we're back with our panel, Byron, Julie, and Marc. Byron, so Daniel Snyder has gone from heck no, never, ever, to some major sponsors saying we are pulling our money, so now it's a maybe? YORK: Listen, it's going to happen. The idea of holding and making a study of this change is just a prelude to actually doing it. And the difference between now and what happened in the past is a change in corporate America. Not only is the NFL a giant business that is opposed to the name, by FedEx, the company which purchased the naming rights to the Redskins stadium now has made it very clear it wants the name changed. It would lose other sponsorships as well, so this is going to happen. EMANUEL: Julie, your thoughts? PACE: This isn't just public sentiment changing. There's been a lot of pressure on the Redskins for a lot of years to take this step. I think a lot of this is about money. When you start to lose sponsors, including the naming sponsor of your stadium, when they start to say we are not comfortable with this name, the ownership really, I don't think, has any choice moving forward. EMANUEL: And Marc, it sounds like a new name could be new merchandise and old gear could be retro, and so probably a lot of money to be made if you change, right? THIESSEN: Yes, well, this is being done for the woke mob, not for the Native-Americans. The \"Washington Post\" had a poll in 2016, 90 percent of Native-Americans are not offended by the Redskins name, 80 percent wouldn't be offended if you came up and called them a redskin to their face even if you were not a Native-American. So this is not being done for the Native- American. It's being done for the mob that is tearing down the statues and terrorizing the entire country. And you know what, they're coming after the Chicago Blackhawks and they're coming after the Atlanta Braves and they're coming after the Kansas City Chiefs next. So this is only the beginning. EMANUEL: Sorry, I got a little excited about Candidate Casino. Let's go there. All right, the Joe Biden Veep-stakes. Byron where is your money going? YORK: Look, I think the big question is whether the Democratic base will be happy with all-white ticket. My guess is they will not, so I'm still high on Kamala Harris with $40. If they're OK with that, Elizabeth Warren next with $20. Val Demings and Keisha Lance Bottoms with $15, and Tammy Duckworth, a possibility at $10. EMANUEL: Julie, where's your money going? PACE: I'm with Byron that I think there's a lot of focus on some of the African-American women who are in contention. I've got $40 on Kamala Harris who seems to be leading the pack right now, $20 on Val Demings, and $20 on Keisha Lance Bottoms, the mayor of Atlanta, $20 on Elizabeth Warren, though, still really hanging on and a favorite of a lot of liberals in the Democratic Party. EMANUEL: And Marc? THIESSEN: So I'm also agreeing with everybody it's probably going to be an African-American woman. I put 50 on the person who I think it should be, which is Val Demings because Joe Biden needs to reach both the base and the swing voters and get them both excited. Val Demings was an impeachment manager, she's an African-American, she's popular with the police, but she's also a former police chief, and that would strengthen Joe Biden's message that he's a moderate who is not for dismantling the police. I also put down $20 on Kamala Harris, $20 on Susan Rice, and $10 on Keisha Lance Bottoms. EMANUEL: All right, if it's Friday, that means it's time for Winners and Losers. Byron, you go. YORK: Winner is Janis Shinwari who for eight years was a translator for American troops in Afghanistan, credited with saving at least five American lives, all while being targeted by the Taliban, became a U.S. citizen this week, a very happy even for everyone involved. The loser is Ghislaine Maxwell, Jeffrey Epstein's girlfriend, procurer, close associate for years. Now she's been arrested, and we might finally learn more about what Epstein did with some of his very rich and very powerful friends. EMANUEL: Let's go to Julie, winners and losers? PACE: So my winner this week is the Biden campaign. All the polls are moving in the direction, big fundraising week. Of course, you don't want to be the winner in July. You want to be the winner in November, so a lot of time to go in that race. My loser, fireworks. I love fireworks. Cancelled across so much of the country this holiday weekend. EMANUEL: Marc, take it away. THIESSEN: My winner is the U.S. economy, creating 4.8 million jobs in the last month. That's 20 times -- that's not only a record. That's 20 times the normal rate in an expansion. We're going to have 20 to 30 percent economic growth. Donald Trump is going to be riding a big economic wave into the reelection campaign. And my loser Joe Biden because he was downplaying the good economic news. America has been through so much. We've been through race riots, we've been through a pandemic, we've been through the worst economy since the Great Depression, and we get some good news, and Joe Biden says don't celebrate. Give me a break. EMANUEL: All right, panel, thanks very much, an action-packed week. When we come back, this week's \"Notable Quotables.\" (COMMERCIAL BREAK) EMANUEL: Finally tonight, it is Friday, so that means this week's \"Notable Quotables.\" (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, (R) PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: If you don't have confidence, you're not going to do very well. MAYOR BILL DE BLASIO, (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: The vast majority of New Yorkers want safety, and they want respect from NYPD officers. They don't want to see any bias, and we're going to strike that balance, and I think this budget helps us do it. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Let's mark the date on the calendar and how long it's going to be before we'll have that conversation about New Yorkers crying out for more police. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Today we announced the arrest of one of the villains in this investigation. She had slithered away to a gorgeous property in New Hampshire. DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES: \u00a0The numbers speak for themselves. I'n very concerned and I'm not satisfied which what's going because we are going on the wrong direction. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: People need to treat this like a hurricane, a hurricane is coming to my community. TRUMP: I had asked a mask on, I sort of liked the way I looked. I looked like the Lone Ranger. JOE BIDEN, (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I can hardly wait to compare my cognitive capability to the cognitive capability of the man I'm running against. KAYLEIGH MCENANY, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: This president, I'll tell you, is the most informed person on planet earth when it comes to the threats that we face. MIKE POMPEO, SECRETARY OF STATE: There are many folks using the Taliban or who have used the Taliban over years and years and years as proxy forces. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Right? It don't smell right. TRUMP: Nobody is going to shatter the American dream. God bless America. (END VIDEO CLIP) EMANUEL: Amen. Another wild week in the world of news, and it's not over yet. President Trump will speak tonight from Mount Rushmore and 10:00 p.m. eastern time. We will of course have complete live coverage. Following that I will be back for \"FOX News at Night.\" Tomorrow, starting at 6:00 p.m. eastern right here on FOX News we will bring you President Trump's \"Salute to American\" celebration.

I'm Dana Perino, along with Jesse Watters, Greg Gutfeld, Juan Williams, and Katie Pavlich. It is 5:00 in New York City. This is The Five. Fox News alert, President Trump getting ready to hold a news conference any moment now in the Rose Garden. We will bring it to you live once it happens. And while we wait for that, President Trump and Joe Biden squaring off over how best to bring back jobs after the pandemic damaged the economy. The former vice president trying to slice into President Trump's polling advantage on the economy, Biden quick to criticize President Trump during his speech today. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: It's gotten bad enough that even Donald Trump finally decided to wear a mask in public. I'm glad he made the shift. Mr. President, it's not enough. We won't be able to turn the corner and get American people back to work safely without presidential leadership. Mr. President, open everything now isn't a strategy for success. It's barely a slogan. Quit pushing the false choice between protecting our health and protecting our economy. All it does is endanger our recovery on both fronts. (END VIDEO CLIP) PERINO: Biden also calling for $2 trillion in new clean energy spending. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BIDEN: When Donald Trump thinks about climate change, the only word he can muster is hoax. When I think about climate change, the word I think of is jobs. Science tells us we have nine years before the damage is irreversible. We are going to make historic investments, so we will seize the opportunity and meet this moment in history. We are going to get to work delivering results right away on day one. (END VIDEO CLIP) PERINO: All right. Greg, let me ask you. A lot of that stuff in the -- when it comes to energy policy, do you feel like you could've heard that before, maybe in the previous administration? GREG GUTFELD, FOX NEWS HOST: Maybe. But it is -- Biden economically is kind of terrifying, because he's all in on the Green New Deal, including this apocalyptic nine year vision that is not based on any science but rather AOC-led hysteria. So we are handing our economy -- not over to Joe Biden, the seasoned Vice President or Senator. We're handing it over Greta Thunberg in an old man suit. And that's scares me. But another interesting point about when you compare economies, no, the Democrats love to talk about how they are the masters of the safety net. And I want people to just think about what the experience of 2020 was, when we had a Republican-built Trump designed economy that was essentially a safety net that was tested. It was actually tested. And it actually succeeded. Unlike the safety nets created by Democrats, this safety net was tested by a novel catastrophe that we've never experienced before in our lives. Nobody has starved. We have made it through. We have made sacrifices. But we are getting it done largely because of this incredible economy that allowed for a safety net to occur to give out these payments, to make sure people were OK. This is a Republican-built safety net that just blew the doors off any Democrat safety net of the last 50 years. Meanwhile, what are the Dems pushing, an apocalyptic vision that chooses the mob over the individual. When you see somebody -- pushing for achievement, Biden is pushing the politics of envy. And that will get us nowhere in the long run, or even the short term. PERINO: Jesse, this was the second phase of the Biden rollout on his economic plan. Last week was buy American, today, is all about energy. And if you think about the Midwest and how important it is for both candidates to try to win in 2020, what -- how do you think Biden threaded that needle today between going after the progressives who were talking about the apocalyptic climate change issue, as Greg was pointing out. But also this idea for additional jobs and the clean energy market, can you do that? JESSE WATTERS, FOX NEWS HOST: Biden just plagiarized Bernie Sanders' environmental plan, or Bernie Bros. just put a gun to Biden's head and Biden said fine. I will say whatever you want me to say. I mean, this is literally AOC's Green New Deal here, $2 trillion on wind and solar. Do you really think Joe Biden or any of his people can pull it off? First of all, solar only works economically and environmentally in the United States, in the southwest. Wind power only works in the Great Plains in the Midwest. But I guarantee you. All of this trillions of dollars, it's just going to go to lobbyists and donors. And they're going to put some, like, windmill in Maine and a solar panel in Montana. And it's just not going to work. It's just another boondoggle because they are not smart enough to be able to pull it off. The smartest thing to say, if I were Joe Biden, would say I'd be for fracking. But he went so far left in the primary he doesn't like fracking now. Because natural gas is the cleanest energy source we are ever going to have. And god blessed the United States with mountains and mountains of it. And we are just sitting on piles of it. So you can even balance a few solar panels and some windmills with this beautiful, clean, natural gas, and call it a day. But he just won't do it. And Donald Trump can come at him and just say you are an economic illiterate. You don't know what you are talking about. This is basically AOC on steroids. Get out of here and let me rebuild the economy, because Americans trust me more than you by double digits. PERINO: Juan, when the Biden campaign was putting out some PR right before the speech, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez was also tweeting, taking a lot of credit for the speech. Does that keep Biden keep his moderate label? JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS HOST: I think that, you know, a lot of this back and forth over the economic policy at this moment, Dana, I don't think that it really matter as a whole lot if what we are aiming at is the November election. Because I think at the moment, the urgent policy stuff leads us to a referendum on Donald Trump. And right now, Trump is beating Trump. Because if you look at big ticket items, like, you know, do we send our kids back to school in the fall? Axios, iPost has a pullout today, 70 percent of Americans think that's too risky to send our kids back to school. And that includes, like, 79 percent of Democrats and 53 percent of Republicans. No, I'm talking about the election. Because I think that as we aim towards energy, as we aim towards something like how do you get this economy going for the high percentage of people, I think it's like 11, 12 percent now out of work. And you think about the fact that we have arguments coming from this White House over extending unemployment benefits at the end of this month, I think again. Donald Trump is out of sync with the American people. But, you know, it's like when the 5.4 million Americans lose their health insurance, that's a big economic issue. And where is Trump? He is trying to undo Obamacare. So to me, these are urgent policy issues way beyond whether or not we rebuild the infrastructure, which I think is fairly sensible. Whether we rebuild the manufacturing sector, this is what is determining the election. PERINO: Yeah, OK. Katie, we do know that across the board, President Trump does beat Don -- Joe Biden on matters of the economy. I haven't seen him broken down too much in terms of energy. But you were over at the White House today. Tell me your perspective on all this. KATIE PAVLICH, FOX NEWS HOST: I was at the White House today. I had the chance to interview President Trump. He did talk about the election and Joe Biden and said that the economy will crash if Joe Biden wins the election. He talked about how Joe Biden has been in office and around Washington, D.C. for almost five decades. And yet, now all of a sudden is hitching his wagon to this Green New Deal 2.0. And look, you know, you can't argue, as Joe Biden has, that you want to bring back American manufacturing, while also at the same time try to promise some kind of Green New Deal, because the regulations in this country are ready and due to the Environmental Protection Agency and a whole host of other overreach by the government have prevented manufacturing from coming back to this country. And it's going to be very expensive for the average family. Remember in 2016 when Hillary Clinton made the mistake of saying we're going to put coal miners out of business? That's exactly what this will do. Electricity prices will go up. And we tried this before, the Obama administration, which Joe Biden was a part of, lost $5 billion of taxpayer money on Solyndra, which was the solar company that they just gave a bunch of recovery money to that was not successful. So these two things do not go together. You can't promise manufacturing in America while also promising all these regulations, which do not allow of the ingenuity and manufacturing to take place here. PERINO: For viewers that have been watching for many years, you all remember the fond days when we talked about Solyndra over and over. (CROSSTALK) PERINO: All right, Solyndra. We are still awaiting a news conference from President Trump and we will have it for you live. But coming up next, the armed of Missouri couple who confronted protesters outside their home are now saying that they will be indicted. We will have details after the break. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) WATTERS: President Trump set to hold a news conference in the Rose Garden at any moment. Meanwhile, as anarchy rages in cities across America, St. Louis prosecutors appear to have a case of misguided priorities. The armed homeowner who faced off with protesters who broke into his gated community last month says he and his wife will be indicted soon. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: My attorney advised me not to be on the show tonight because of rumors that we are going to be indicted shortly, OK? Having said that, this is the same circuit attorney that released 35 of the protesters that torched and looted downtown St. Louis. But now, she wants to indict me. I didn't shoot anybody. I just held my ground, protected my house. And I'm sitting here on television tonight instead of dead or putting up the smouldering embers of my home. (END VIDEO CLIP) WATTERS: All right. Katie, you spoke with the president earlier about this. It looks like this radical DA Kim Gardner out in St. Louis got a judge to approve her warrant to go in and seize the firearm of this guy. And now, he saying he could be indicted, for what? PAVLICH: For what is the question. The president said that this was a disgrace. This couple was just defending their home and their property. And Jesse, in St. Louis, the law there is they have your stand your ground self-defense law. They were on their own private property. There was a mob that broke through the gate on their private property. They felt threatened. They went out to defend themselves and their lives. They had seen for weeks on end of private property and people almost killed if not killed as a result of these rioters going through the streets. There was, of course, a shop owner in Texas, I believe, who was murdered outside of his shop for daring to defend himself, who he didn't have a gun. So this idea now that this couple, who was obeying the law, following the rules, defending their lives and their property from the mob, are now being politically persecuted by these prosecutors in St. Louis. It is a disgrace. It's an atrocity. It's a miscarriage of justice. And although they know they have no evidence to prove that they committed a crime, they're going to drag them to the legal system anyway and make an example of them that you better not stand up to the mob because this is what's going to happen to you. And it's pretty clear the prosecutors are on the side of the criminals here, not on the side of the innocent victims who are victims of a mob going onto their lawn and threatening their lives. WATTERS: Yes. And we are hearing that the president is going to be speaking momentarily, so we will take you to that when that begins. Greg, this is basic Constitutional stuff. You are allowed to own a firearm. You are allowed to defend your property, your land, and the government cannot go inside your home and take your gun. GUTFELD: Yeah. Well, here's the deal. It's weird that the media has to assure the white liberals that the rising spike in crime is just in poor neighborhoods. So there is no problem with de-funding police or even attacking them. So I'm trying to figure out, when does crime actually matter? If we take inventory, we dismissed the burning buildings as an anomaly, the looted neighborhoods as a cry for economic justice, gang violence as murder. Something that's been here forever, right, and now, we have mob action in the suburb where they tear down the guys' gate and they laugh at that. People don't understand that the more that you dismiss law and order and champion the mob, there's only one thing left for the citizen. And it's the Second freaking Amendment. And we are seeing that now. This is a symbol of things to come. WATTERS: Yeah. And gun sales skyrocketing all over the country, Dana. And this DA seems to be pretty out there, source-funded, she let a bunch of looters and rioters go without charging them. And she's in a -- I guess primary election race coming up in August, so looks like politics to me. PERINO: Well, and I think that one of the things that even the lawyer for the couple suggested that they not go on television because they could in - - getting -- indicted. Their only recourse at this point was to maybe avoid that is publicity, possibly. You know, we'll see what happens to them. But this is not the only place that we are seeing this. Look at what happened in New York City over the weekend or even just yesterday. So Mayor Bill De Blasio, he paints this painting of black lives matter in front of Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue, and he tweeted incessantly about it. Rather than talking about all of the violence we saw, if anybody hasn't had a chance to see Lawrence Jones' interview with the father of the young baby that was killed over the weekend. I really recommend that you try to find that. I think it's up on foxnews.com. We have to reorient our priorities. There's just no other way about it. WATTERS: Yeah. I think we do have some sound from some grieving family members that Lawrence got. Let's play that. And then, Juan, you can react. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I have to put my son on the ground now, and he's only one. His birthday two months -- in two months, he didn't even live to see two. Like, he didn't live life. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Everybody is talking about black lives matter. What about baby lives, what about teenage lives, go to hell. You can go to hell. (END VIDEO CLIP) WATTERS: It's heartbreaking, Juan. WILLIAMS: Yeah. I mean, we've had discussion. And I've very clearly. You have to care about the kind of crime that you see in these poor neighborhoods. But it's not a matter of crime waves throughout the city. Let's go back to St. Louis for a second. Because I think it's important that we have some context and some facts on the table. First of all, it's speculation about the indictment. We don't know what's going to come. I will stay say this, that the statute, the law in Missouri doesn't allow you to brandish a weapon in a threatening, intimidating matter. And as we saw in the video that we showed right here, there was nobody attacking that couple. They were marching towards the mayor's house, which is in that gated development. So I think that when you look at that you say, well, Garner's going to make a decision. It may be a political decision, but that's the decision that's going to be made. Because if you have guns in a potential confrontation, it can be provocative, and we know that brandishing guns in front of people can lead to -- (CROSSTALK) WILLIAMS: So I don't that you should just ignore this thing. She clearly was. Let me finish this point, because the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, in editorial, said, you know, these people, this couple, you have got to know some context. You got to know they're highly litigious, sued their own father and sister that the people at the neighboring synagogue said that these people made the children cry. I mean, this is -- you know, you have to see the whole picture. And if you choose to simply focus -- I want to say these people, they're being victimized in terms of their Second Amendment rights. That's a distortion of this story. WATTERS: OK. Well, Katie, I don't know if Juan knows the law -- (CROSSTALK) GUTFELD: Wait a minute, though. WATTERS: Go ahead. GUTFELD: Are you OK with seeing the whole picture with every victim that we talk about, Juan? When -- if somebody gets killed? (CROSSTALK) WILLIAMS: -- if you have something to say, I'm glad to hear you. (CROSSTALK) GUTFELD: You aren't. Anytime you bring up the background of anybody, unless it's somebody you don't like. WILLIAMS: What are you talking about? I'm talking about the St. Louis, what the St. Louis Post-Dispatch wrote, what the statute of the law says in Missouri. And those are facts and those are contexts for our viewers tonight. WATTERS: All right. Well, let's -- (CROSSTALK) WATTERS: Go ahead. PAVLICH: Yea. I would just hope that anybody who had a mob show up and break into their property would be entitled to their own self defense instead of ending up dead on their doorstep of their home or their business. And the fact is that brandishing has a very different legal term than what Juan is discussing. And it's not brandishing to go outside of your home while there is a mob that has broken to run your private property, is threatening you, that is refusing to leave. That was told to leave multiple times and refused to do so. That is not brandishing a weapon. That is called self defense. And that's exactly what they were doing. And they are alive today as a result and their house remains standing, instead of being burned it down like churches that we've seen, like the buildings in Minneapolis, like the buildings all around the country that have been burned down. And people's lives destroyed as a result of that. WATTERS: Yeah. And not only -- WILLIAMS: Katie, I don't think from the video we saw that there was any motion from the protesters towards that couple. The protesters are -- (CROSSTALK) WATTERS: Hey, Juan. (CROSSTALK) WATTERS: Because if you watched the video -- (CROSSTALK) WATTERS: And they were armed themselves. So to go outside to, you have open-carry -- (CROSSTALK) WATTERS: -- you have castle doctrine and you have stand your ground. And if you knew what you were doing, you'd do the same thing to protect your property and your wife. Next, President Trump's news conference coming up soon, next up, Greg's monologue on the press giving a free pass to New York Governor Andrew Cuomo despite his disastrous handling of the pandemic. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) PAVLICH: You are looking live at the Rose Garden where the president is about to give a news conference. But in the meantime, Hillary Clinton is back stoking fear and paranoia -- the election with this morning about President Trump if he loses in November. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) HILLARY CLINTON, FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I think it is a fair point to raise as to whether or not, if he loses, he's going to go quietly or not. And we have to be ready for that. (END VIDEO CLIP) COMPAGNO: Dana, here we are again with a woman who's never accepted the result of the election, warning about the president not accepting results of the upcoming election. PERINO: They even -- she said that even back in 2016 when it -- actually if you remember on election night it was the Hillary Clinton team that hinted that she would not, but she did the right thing and she conceded in the morning that next day. I have to imagine that the Biden team would really like for her to do these fundraisers for them, but to maybe cutback on the interviews. I don't think it helps people to remember Hillary Clinton as a candidate in 2016 or 2020. He needs to be his own person. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Thank you very much, everybody. Please. (END VIDEO CLIP) PAVLICH: Thank you, Dana. President Trump in the Rose Garden. Let's watch. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) TRUMP: Thank you. So we've had a big day in the stock market. Things are coming back and they're coming back very rapidly. A lot sooner than people thought. People are feeling good about our country. People are feeling good about therapeutics and possible vaccines, but we're going to go over quite a bit and maybe at the end, we'll take some questions if we have time. It's not too hot. Today, I signed legislation and an executive order to hold China accountable for its oppressive actions against the people of Hong Kong. The Hong Kong Autonomy Act, which I signed this afternoon, passed unanimously through Congress. This law gives my administration powerful new tools to hold responsible the individuals and the entities involved in extinguishing Hong Kong's freedom. We've all watched what happened, not a good situation. Their freedom has been taken away. Their rights have been taken away and with it goes Hong Kong, in my opinion, because it will no longer be able to compete with free markets. A lot of people will be leaving Hong Kong, I suspect. And we're going to do a lot more business because of it because we just lost one competitor. It's the way it is. We lost a very, very serious competitor. A competitor that we incentivized to take a lot of business and do well and we gave them a lot of business by doing what we did. We gave them things that nobody else had the right to do, and that gave them a big edge over other markets. And because of that edge, they've done really historic business, tremendous business, far bigger than anybody would have thought years ago when we did this gift. It was really a gift to freedom. Today, I also signed an executive order ending U.S. preferential treatment for Hong Kong. Hong Kong will now be treated the same as Mainland China, no special privileges, no special economic treatment, and no export of sensitive technologies. In addition to that, as you know, we're placing massive tariffs and have placed very large tariffs on China. First time that's ever happened to China. Billions of dollars have been paid to the United States of which I've given quite a bit to the farmers and ranchers of our country because they were targeted. And that's been going on for three years. It's the first time anybody's ever done anything like that. And prior to the plague pouring in from China, they were having the worst year as you know, in 67 years. And I don't want them to have a bad year. I want them to have a good year, but they were taking advantage of the United States for many, many years, and that's stopping. But then the virus came in and the world is a different place, but we're now getting back and one of the reasons the market's doing -- it's almost at the point that it was at prior to the plague. Almost, we're getting very close. It's a great thing. It's an amazing thing what our people have done and what they've endured. No administration has been tougher on China then this administration. We imposed historic tariffs. We stood up to China's intellectual property theft at a level that nobody's ever come close. We confronted untrustworthy Chinese technology and telecom providers. We convinced many countries, many countries, and I did this myself for the most part, not to use Huawei because we think it's an unsafe security risk. It's a big security risk. I talked many countries out of using it. If they want to do business with us, they can't use it. Just today, I believe that U.K. announced that they're not going to be using it. And that was up in the air for a long time but they've decided. And you look at Italy, you look at many other countries. We withdrew from the Chinese dominated, WHO, and we fully rebuilt the United States military. The WHO, World Health Organization, we were paying close to $500 million a year. China was paying $39 million a year. And China had too much say, they worked it very hard, which is a bad thing done by our past administrations. But we were tough and we were saying, I was asking, I said, \"Why are we paying so much more than China?\" China has 1.4 billion people. We have 325, probably 325 million approximately, nobody can give the exact count. We're trying to get an exact count, but you have over the years, many illegals who have come into the country. So it depends on how you want to count it. But you could say 325 to 350 million people, as opposed to 1.4 billion people. And the World Trade is terrible, that deal is terrible. The World Health is terrible deal. We've been very tough on the World Trade Organization and we've been, I guess, as tough as you can get on World Health. We withdrew our money. We told them we're getting out. It doesn't mean that someday we won't go back in. Maybe we will when it's correctly run, but they made a lot of bad predictions and they said a lot of bad things about what to do and how to do it and they turned out to be wrong. And they were really a puppet of China. And make no mistake, we hold China fully responsible for concealing the virus and unleashing it upon the world. They could have stopped it. They should have stopped. It would have been very easy to do at the source when it happened. In contrast, Joe Biden's entire career has been a gift to the Chinese Communist Party and to the calamity of errors that they've made. They made so many errors and it's been devastating for the American worker. China has taken out hundreds of billions of dollars a year from our country. And we rebuilt China. I give them all the credit in the world. I don't give the credit for the people that used to stand here because they allowed this to happen where hundreds of billions of dollars were taken out of the United States Treasury in order to rebuild China. There's no company and no country in the world, no country in the world has ever ripped off the United States like the incredible job that they did on this country and the people that ran it. Possibly, it's one of the reasons, certainly it's one of the very big reasons trade and things related to trade that I got elected in the first place. I've been talking about it for a long time, along with many other subjects, frankly. Joe Biden supported China's entry into the World Trade Organization. One of the greatest geopolitical and economic disasters in world history. If you look at China, you look at the moment they joined the World Trade, they were flatlining for years and years and years and decades. And then all of a sudden, they joined the World Trade Organization, and they went like a rocket ship. They were given all sorts of advantages. They were considered a developing country. As a developing country, they got tremendous advantages over the United States and other countries, and they took advantage of those advantages and then some. Biden personally led the effort to give China permanent, most favored nation status, which is a tremendous advantage for a country to have. Few countries have it. But the United States doesn't have it. It never did, probably never even asked for it because they didn't know what they were doing. As Vice President Biden was a leading advocate of the Paris Climate Accord, which was unbelievably expensive to our country. It would have crushed American manufacturers while allowing China to pollute the atmosphere with impunity, yet one more gift from Biden to the Chinese Communist Party. They took all of the advantage away from us. They took everything away. They don't have oil. We would have had to close up a tremendous amounts of our energy to qualify, eventually, not too far into the future. We would have had to do things that would have been unbelievably destructive to our country, including the possible closing of 25 percent of our businesses, think of that. And it was going to cost us hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars for the privilege of being involved in the Paris Climate Accord. And you just have to look at what took place this year in Paris and France where money was being sent to, countries all over the world and the people of France didn't want to take it, and they didn't, and they did a lot of rioting. They had their taxes raised. We would have had to raise our taxes and it was a disaster. I've been given a lot of credit for what I did there. It took a certain amount of courage, I guess, because it sounds so nice, the Paris Climate Accord. But it wasn't good for us at all. America lost nearly 10,000 factories while Joe Biden was Vice President. Think of that, 10,000 factories. He wrote something today and he made a statement today that I wrote down. It's pretty accurate. So Biden was here for 47 years. Eight years, the last eight years, not long ago as Vice President, he said, \"One in five miles of our highways are still in poor condition.\" Well, we're doing a good job on highways, but why didn't he fix them three years ago? Why didn't he fix them? Tens of thousands of bridges are in disrepair and on the verge of collapse. Well, that's probably not a right number, but we have bridges that should have been fixed. Why didn't he fix him? He was here for eight years with President Obama. Why didn't they fix them? Tens of thousands of bridges. This is what he wrote. High speed broadband. We want high speed broadband. Well, why didn't they get it? Three years ago is not a long time. And he didn't do any of the things, but now he says he's going to be president and as president, he's going to do all the things that he didn't do. He never did -- he never did anything except make very bad decisions, especially on foreign policy. So Joe Biden and President Obama freely allowed China to pillage our factories, plunder our communities and steal our most precious secrets. And I've stopped it, largely, but I've stopped it and it wasn't easy because you talk about a certain power of the telephone and the calls where they would call and say, \"No, we don't want to do that.\" And other countries would call on behalf of China, but I did it. I did what has to be done. And you just take a look at what's gone on and take a look at the kind of -- the numbers where they devalued their currency in order to pay the tariffs. Now, the Democrat party is calling for defunding of our military. Think of that, defunding. They want to defund our military when China is building a massive military. They're building a massive military and Biden wants to defund our military. And the world needs American strength right now, more than ever. And we've got it. We've got now, soon as all this equipment comes in, all made in the USA, we've got the newest, most incredible weapons anywhere in the world. We have the best tanks, the best ships, the best missiles, rockets. We have the best of everything. We have the best fighter jets, the F-35, the F-18. All of these assets are being built, tankers, incredible tankers, bombers. I hope we don't have to use them, but we have the most incredible military. When I came in, the military was totally depleted. It was at a level that was just absolutely incredible. You know the statements. I made the statements before. I told you what generals told me about our military. And I'll make them again. If somebody needs them, we'll give them to you. It's very well documented. As Vice President Biden opposed tariffs, and he was standing up for China. He didn't want to do anything to disrupt the relationship with China even though China was taking us to the cleaners. He opposed my very strict travel ban on Chinese nationals to stop the spread of the China virus. He was totally against it. Xenophobic, he called me, Xenophobic. A month later, he admitted I was right. We would have had thousands of people additionally die if we let people come in from heavily infected China, but we stopped it. We did a travel ban in January. Nancy Pelosi was dancing in the streets of Chinatown in San Francisco a month later and even later than that and others too. They all thought what I did was a terrible mistake. We would have lost -- in fact, Dr. Fauci said we would have lost thousands of additional people if President Trump had to do that. And I was a crowd of one, because even experts didn't want to do it. They thought it was a mistake. And then I did Europe when I started seeing what was going on in Italy and Spain and France and other countries in Europe. I did a ban on people coming in from Europe. That would have been disastrous for our country also. And we saved tens of thousands of lives, but we actually saved millions of lives by closing. By closing up, we saved millions, potentially, millions of lives. It could be, a number that we're actually working on, but it could be two to three million lives. So we're at 135,000, which is terrible. One is too much, but we would have had millions of people dead from this curse that came at us, but we did what we had to do. And now we'll put out the flames as it happens. We have to get the schools open. We have to get everything open. A lot of people don't want to do that for political reasons, not for other reasons. But if we had listened to Joe Biden, hundreds of thousands of additional lives would have been lost. And if you look at the job, he did on swine flu, I looked at a poll, they have polls on everything nowadays, and they got very bad marks on the job they did on the swine flu, H1N1. He calls it N1H1. H1N1 got very poor marks from Gallup on the job they did on swine flu. And they stopped very early on, testing. They totally stopped it. They just said stop. And frankly, if we didn't test, you wouldn't have all the headlines because we're showing cases, and we have just about the lowest mortality rate. But if we did -- think of this, if we didn't do testing, instead of testing over 40 million people, if we did half the testing, we would have half the cases. If we did another -- you cut that in half, we'd have yet again, half of that. But the headlines are always testing. Now the testing is a good thing, but at the same time, it's fodder for the fake news to report cases. So we're doing 40 million plus, it's going to be very close to 45 million people. And when I turned on the news, I see cases, cases, cases. They don't talk about deaths being cut down to a level that actually tenfold they use. I got that from one of the very respected media outlets, tenfold, cut tenfold, yes, but they don't talk about that. They talk about cases and the cases are created because of the fact that we do tremendous testing. We're the best testing in the world. We now make ventilators for the world. We had very few ventilators. There wasn't one person in any hospital anywhere in this country that needed a ventilator that didn't get it. And that was because we mobilized to a level, using the Purchasing Act in some cases, we mobilized to a level that nobody thought possible. Nothing's happened like that since World War II. Our task force has done a great job. Mike Pence works so hard but gets so little credit. It's sad to see that actually, but he works so hard and gets so little credit. The governors would tell us, we'd be on the phone with 50 different governors, they'd all tell us what a great job, great job. And then they'll go to the media and say, \"Well, they didn't do such a good job.\" Well, we did a great job. We made a lot of governors look fantastic. We did in New York -- what we did in New York was one of the most incredible things, 2,800 bed in Javits Center, but the governor used very few of them unfortunately. Then we moved in our great hospital ship, one of our two great -- we move one also to Los Angeles. And we could have used that for our senior citizens. We could have used it for other people. They could have used it instead of sending our seniors back into nursing homes that were infected where you lost thousands of people. Thousands of people in New York died because of poor management by the governor. And it's a very sad thing to see and very sad to watch and very sad to look at those statistics. But we have -- we have an incredible Javits Center that we built with thousands of beds. I think it was 2,800 all ready to go and they could have sent people there, or they could have sent senior citizens there instead of sending them into the nursing homes. And after all of that work and getting it done, the Army Corps of Engineers, I mean, the job they did was incredible. They built it in a matter of days. When it was all completed, FEMA, everybody was there, doctors. We ended up getting doctors. They said, \"We can't man it.\" I said, \"So we'll man it and woman it.\" And that's what we did. We brought in doctors, nurses, everything, we're all set. They didn't send the people. Very few people came in. They could have sent them into the Javits Center. They could have sent him to the hospital ship, which was virtually unused. But we were there. By contrast, my administration acted very early to ban travel from China, from Europe, saving all of these lives, incredible. And I want everyone to know, I want every citizen now that we're using the full power of the Federal government to fight the China virus and to keep our people safe. Through Operation Warp Speed, we will deliver a vaccine in record breaking time. We're doing very well on the vaccines. We have many, many different vaccines being studied right now, many of which are looking really good. And we're ready to distribute the vaccine when we get it. We're all set, taking a risk, an economic risk of preparing for delivery because we feel very certain it's going to be there. But logistically we have our military ready to go. We have generals that -- that's all they do is distribute things and they're going to be distributing hopefully a vaccine or a therapeutic, and it's coming out really well. And I think you're going to have some good news very, very quickly having to do with the vaccines. We're also working with many other countries on the vaccine. Many countries are working with us. We're unleashing our nation's scientific genius to kill the virus. Joe Biden didn't just side with China on the virus, he did. He called me again, xenophobic. That's what he said. You all heard it many times. He described the rise of China as \"a very positive development.\" It's not a positive development. Not for us it's not. He said that the idea that China is our competition is really bizarre. He's really bizarre. He said, \"China is not a problem.\" No, nobody's ripped us off more than China over the last 25, 30 years, nobody close. And he says China is not a problem. Now he takes it all back. Now he wants to be Mr. Tough Guy. But for years, 47 years, he never came out against China, never say anything bad. Just the opposite. His son walked out with $1.5 billion of money to invest where he'll make hundreds of thousands of dollars, maybe millions of dollars a year. He walked out with $1.5 billion. I asked one of the biggest people on Wall Street, maybe the biggest, \"Is that possible?\" He said, no, he's never seen it. They don't do that. But Hunter, where's Hunter, where is Hunter by the way? Hunter Biden walked out with $1.5 billion. In Ukraine, he got $83,000 a month and I guess an upfront payment of $3 million. So he went from not having job to getting $83,000 a month with a lot of money paid up front to work for Burisma. And you all know about Burisma, but nothing happens, nobody cares. And he was unemployed as you know, he was unfortunately forced to leave the military. He was forced to leave. He didn't have a job and, all of a sudden, he's making a fortune, but nobody talks about that. Indeed, Biden expressed more fawning praise about China on an ordinary day than about America. On the 4th of July, the last Independence Day, Biden attacked the United States and said we had, \"never lived up to the ideals of our fathers, our forefathers, or our founding fathers, those founding ideals.\" And yet he enthusiastically stated that China is a great nation and we should hope for its continued expansion. Well, we all wish well to China, but what China has unleashed on the world, it's hard to even fathom. I see people now, friends of mine, they walk up, they want to say hello, and they have to keep their distance and they're all covered up like you're all covered up with face masks. It's a different world, but we're coming out on top. Biden sides with China over America time and time again. And he said on the 4th of July, \"American history is no fairytale.\" And yet blindly celebrates China saying few nations in history have come so far so fast. He's so proud of them. He's so proud of them. Now, Joe Biden is pushing a platform that would demolish the U.S. economy, totally demolish it. So we built the greatest economy in the history of our country, greatest in the history of the world. That was a few months ago. Best unemployment numbers ever, best for African American, Asian American, Hispanic American, best for women, best for everybody, best for young people that didn't have a high school diploma, didn't have a college diploma. If they had a diploma, they were really in good shape. We built the greatest ever stock market, highest ever in history. We had 143 days of all-time stock market highs in just less than three and a half years. And we had to close it down because we did the right thing by doing that. As I said, we saved millions of lives, but China was saying this is incredible what's going on. China was for the first time respecting the United States and now they want to do something that's much different, Joe Biden. So I've watched this and I've watched it with great interest. We're building our economy again. I guess the stock market went up almost 500 points today or something thereabouts, you'll check. But it was up a lot when I left. And our economy is coming back. We're almost at a level where even though it's long before the very important, maybe the most important ever, election of November 3rd. We're long before that, but we're close to record stock markets again. And NASDAQ hit an all-time high for the 16th time. Think of that, for the 16th time over the last month or so, for the 16th time. So one of our markets already hit an all-time high. Today Joe Biden gave a speech in which he said that the core of his economic agenda is a hard-left crusade against American energy. He wants to kill American energy. He wants to reenter the unfair, one-sided Paris Climate Accord, which will destroy us at the expense of many other nations who benefit. It was actually drawn in my opinion, to take advantage of the United States, just like so many other deals that are done to take advantage of the fools running the United States. But this would do nothing for the environment, but would cripple American industry while greatly helping China. He wants to impose massive energy taxes and job crushing mandates to eliminate carbon from the United States economy. Let him define the word carbon because he won't be able to. Obliterating American oil, clean coal, natural gas, and the natural energy resources that supply countless American jobs. Joe Biden put AOC, a young woman, not talented in many ways, in charge of his energy plan and the environment essentially. Her and Bernie Sanders who ran a lot of times for president and never made it. Good base, but that's about it. In other words, he wants to impose the Green New Deal on our country. When I first saw the Green New Deal, I thought it was a joke. I said, \"This will never go anywhere.\" Now they're trying to impose it. This will destroy our country and make us non-competitive with other countries. Don't forget, we're in competition with China and with many other countries throughout the world. We're in tremendous economic competition, including Europe, which has never treated us well. The European Union was formed in order to take advantage of the United States. They formed and they take advantage of the United States. And I know that, they know I know that, but other presidents had no idea. Last week, Joe Biden released his unity platform developed with socialist Bernie Sanders, describing what he would do if elected president. The Biden-Sanders agenda is the most extreme platform of any major party nominee by far in American history. I think it's worse than actually Bernie's platform. It's gone so far, right? And he's doing that because he's begging for that vote. But one of the things I just asked my people to do is just draw up for me just quickly some of the things that we've been hearing about over the last couple of weeks. And these are actual key elements of the Biden Sanders unity platform. Abolish immigration detention, no more detention. You come in here illegally, no more detention. Stop all deportations. So if we get a MS-13 gang member, which we've taken out of our country by the thousands, brought them back to Honduras, Guatemala, you can't do that anymore. El Salvador, you can't do that anymore. Stop all deportations. In other words, we'll take all of these people, many of whom are in prison for rape, murder, lots of other things. End prosecution of illegal border crossers. Oh, OK, they come in illegally and we have to stop the whole process. Support the deadly sanctuary cities where many of these people are protected better than the American citizen is protected. Incentivize illegal alien child smuggling. Give it an incentive because if you look at what they're saying, that's exactly what they do.

The U.S. adds a record number of jobs but also sees record numbers of new coronavirus cases. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: This is the largest monthly jobs gain in history. EMANUEL: The president takes a victory lap as the U.S. gains back millions of jobs. But his 2020 rival says it's too soon to declare victory. JOE BIDEN, PRESUMPTIVE DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: We're still down nearly 15 million jobs, and the pandemic is getting worse, not better. EMANUEL: Even as markets rebound and consumer confidence rises, states with hot spots are pulling back, and enhanced unemployment benefits could end within weeks. We'll talk with labor secretary and coronavirus task force member, Eugene Scalia, about whether more stimulus is needed. It's a \"FOX News Sunday\" exclusive. Then -- DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, WHITE HOUSE CORONAVIRUS TASK FORCE MEMBER: The numbers speak for themselves. EMANUEL: -- as officials warn Americans to avoid crowds this holiday weekend, four out of five states see coronavirus spikes. We'll talk with Dr. Ashish Jha, director of the Harvard Global Health Institute, about how leaders can slow the surge and what's ahead for work and school this fall. Plus confusion over when the president knew about reports Russia put bounties on American troops. TRUMP: Intelligence people didn't even -- many of them didn't believe it happened at all. EMANUEL: We'll talk live with Senator Jack Reed, top Democrat on the Armed Services Committee, about bipartisan pressure for an explanation. And the president's fiery rhetoric on statues and cancel culture. TRUMP: Our nation is witnessing a merciless campaign to wipe out our history. EMANUEL: We'll ask our Sunday panel about the politics of embracing the past. All, right now, on \"FOX News Sunday\". (END VIDEOTAPE) EMANUEL: And hello again on this Independence Day weekend from FOX News in Washington. Americans face yet more uncertainty as the number of coronavirus infections hits new highs. Some states are pumping the brakes on reopening and many July 4th celebrations were scaled back. This comes as the Labor Department reports the U.S. added 4.8 million jobs last month and as the president heats up his rhetoric over how to frame our nation's past leaders. In a moment, we'll talk with Labor Secretary Eugene Scalia. But, first, Mark Meredith joins us live from the White House with the latest -- Mark. MARK MEREDITH, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Mike, President Trump invited friends, family and first responders to the White House last night for the Fourth of July celebration while in other cities because COVID cases are surging, celebrations were canceled to help slow the spread. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MEREDITH: President Trump celebrated Independence Day by watching a dazzling flyover showcasing America's military might. But in his prepared remarks, a more somber tone. TRUMP: We are now in the process of defeating the radical left, the Marxists, the anarchists of the agitators, the looters, and people who in many instances have absolutely no clue what they are doing. MEREDITH: White House guests were encouraged but not required to wear masks or social distance. The speech echoed the president's fiery rhetoric a day earlier at Mount Rushmore. While Joe Biden says Americans should embrace the debate over racial injustice. BIDEN: It's past time to fully confront systemic racism and our growing economic inequity to deal with the denial of our nation's promise. MEREDITH: Protests continued throughout the weekend, and in Baltimore, demonstrators toppled a statue of Christopher Columbus. Meantime, there were plenty of fireworks on Capitol Hill last week as lawmakers demanded answers over reports Russia offered bounties to militants to target U.S. troops in Afghanistan. Democrats accused President Trump of ignoring the issue. REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA), SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE: He should spend more time reading the daily presidential brief than planning military parades. MEREDITH: The White House continues to celebrate the latest jobs report with the Labor Department reporting 4.8 million jobs added in June, a potential sign the economy is bouncing back from its pandemic lows. (END VIDEOTAPE) MEREDITH: The president says he's open to another round of direct payments and help for small businesses, but lawmakers remain split, Mike, about how to move forward with this potential next stimulus bill -- Mike. EMANUEL: Mark Meredith reporting from the White House -- Mark, thanks very much. MEREDITH: You bet. EMANUEL: Joining me now, secretary of labor and White House coronavirus task force member, Eugene Scalia. Mr. Secretary, welcome to \"FOX News Sunday.\" EUGENE SCALIA, SECRETARY OF LABOR: Mike, thanks for having me. EMANUEL: Forty percent of the job growth in June of what was a huge jobs report was in leisure and hospitality, which includes restaurants and bars, but now, in some of those COVID hot spots states, those businesses are being restricted once again. How is that going to impact our economic growth? SCALIA: Well, Mike, it was an extraordinary jobs report as you said. We added nearly 5 million jobs in June. Projections have been that we might add around 3 million, so we did extremely well. And across industrial sectors -- for example, we saw a really big gains in manufacturing, saw gains in construction, and we saw gains across really nearly all demographic groups. It was a terrific month. But yes, we have new cases. We have to keep an eye on that. I believe that we can continue to reopen our workplaces safely. Our workplaces can be very safe places today but there are precautions that the president, vice president have underscored and those do remain important. We've gotten a reminder of that over the last couple of weeks. EMANUEL: Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell warned Congress this week that unless the viruses brought under control, the nation's economic outlook is extremely uncertain. So, while the latest jobs report was very, very strong, how much does that concern you about the future? SCALIA: Well, yes, the Federal Reserve chair expressed some concerns, but I think it's really important to again remember how much better than projected we've done so far. Back in May, it was projected that we would lose 7.5 million jobs. Well, we've now over the last couple of months added 7.5 million jobs. In other words, we're about 15 million ahead of what the experts that we were going to do. We're doing very well. We do need to be careful about the virus, but I am just optimistic among other reasons because USMCA went into effect last week. We finally put NAFTA to rest. This was something that was so important to the president. USMCA will be another source of stimulus, job growth to the country. So, there will be talk as we get deeper into the month about possible additional measures but I am optimistic, as I know the president is, about how we're reopening, the success we're having right now rebuilding that really extraordinary economy that we have through February until the virus came. EMANUEL: Last week, spending dropped, according to JPMorgan Chase, according to credit card customer data. Isn't this summer vacation season when people are supposed to be outspending, isn't that the driving force of GDP? SCALIA: Well, overall, spending, retail spending, consumer spending generally, new home starts, all of these have been actually very encouraging economic indicators over the last about six weeks or so, so I think when you did pass the job numbers, look at other economic indicators, Mike, actually, it's encouraging on that front too. Now, you know, that doesn't mean that we should rest content -- we know that there remain many Americans still out of work. We want to help them get back to work. That's why the president is talking about potentially additional tax cuts. You know, it was the president's tax cuts, it was his elimination of unnecessary, burdensome regulations that delivered that amazing economy we had before the virus struck. And so, I think additional measures around those lines do warrant discussion as we continue to move forward this month. EMANUEL: Do you see a V-shaped recovery going into the fall, sir? SCALIA: Those that the indications that we see. We again have just been doing so much better over the last two months now than was being projected. And -- and again, when you look at some of the more micro data, very strong indications there as well, but that said, it is going to be important, as you're noting, that people take social distancing seriously, wear masks in circumstances often where they're not able to social distance and the like. We can reopen safely, we can reopen while the virus is still there, but it will get more challenging if people don't take that seriously. EMANUEL: Speaking of that, on COVID-19, since you are a member of the coronavirus task force, new cases in the U.S. hit the largest single day total on Friday, 57,497. And new coronavirus cases on the rise in nearly 40 states, plus Mississippi, Tennessee, Texas, Nevada, and Arizona all sitting records for hospitalizations on Thursday. Looking at the rising cases in these states, did they move too soon or too fast? SCALIA: We knew that as people came out of their homes, emerged from their basements and the like, we knew that cases would go up. We are far, far better prepared to deal with those cases now than we were just a few months ago. We've got a much better understanding of how to treat the virus. We have the equipment, the hospital beds now to deal with the situation. So, this is something that we can manage, but part of managing it, as I've been emphasizing, individual responsibility as well. So we are positioned to deal with these challenges, but we again will have to take them seriously and the task force is certainly focused on delivering aid to these locations as the cases increase. The CDC, the Department of Health and Human Services are dispatching personnel, expertise and equipment where they're needed. EMANUEL: In terms of economic growth, President Trump is talking about what he would like from Congress in the next COVID relief package. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) INTERVIEWER: Let me start with phase four and what might potentially come later this month. Another direct round of payments for individuals -- do support that at this time? DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I do. I support it, but it has to be done properly and I support actually larger numbers than the Democrats. (END VIDEO CLIP) EMANUEL: Mr. Secretary, do you expect a deal shortly after lawmakers return from Independence Day holiday? SCALIA: I think there are going be a lot of discussions toward the end of the month about what additional -- additional measures may be needed. The president moved so swiftly and so effectively to get bipartisan relief with Congress back in March. That was those direct payments. It was the Paycheck Protection Program, which I think has been really an essential part of the recovery we're experiencing right now. And it was also a very substantial on employment benefit that the president put in place in March. So we did a very good job I think back in March positioning ourselves for this reopening and I think the American people can be confident that the president is going to take a careful look again at what further measures may be needed now. EMANUEL: Speaking of that, the president has also been clear about wanting a payroll tax cut. There's been resistance to that on Capitol Hill with some Republican senators being pretty blunt in saying they are not in favor. Are you prepared to give Democrats an unemployment insurance extension to get the payroll tax cut? SCALIA: Well, I think the payroll tax cut is -- could be an important part of, among other things, bringing Americans back to work and fueling job growth in the country. It was the tax cuts, as I mentioned, the president put in place that had a much stronger economy back in February than people were projecting, and I think that we should listen to the president's views on this as we move forward. In terms of the unemployment benefit, it was a really important thing to do as we were shutting our economy down, Americans across the country were basically being told -- and we needed to take measures, but they were basically being told you can't go to work right now. And so, we needed that substantial unemployment benefit. But, you know, there are some states where you can get on an annual basis, $75,000 a year right now on unemployment. And I think as we reopen the economy, I don't know that we need a benefit like that. During the so-called Great Recession 10, 12 years ago when we had a downturn, the added federal unemployment benefit was $25 a week. And what we did in the CARES Act was $600 a week. So, I think this is something we'll get a look at, but I don't think we need that $600 benefit going forward. EMANUEL: Mr. Secretary, finally, I ask this with great sensitivity since I missed my own father every day. The president has spoken this weekend defending statues in this country, including announcing he'd like to include a statue of your late father, Justice Antonin Scalia, in the new National Garden. What would that mean to your family, sir? SCALIA: Well, it's -- it would mean a lot. I -- I didn't see that one coming, Mike, and it was really touching to hear. I hope it would mean a lot to the American people, too. We need heroes. We need to admire our forbearers and recognize what is great and good in our past. And that is what the president is emphasizing right now. As we were reminded yesterday, we are nation conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal. No other nation can claim such an inspiring founding, so many great forbearers, and I certainly was touched to hear my father included on the kind of a list. EMANUEL: Mr. Secretary, thank you. Thanks for your time on this holiday weekend. Please come back. SCALIA: OK. Thanks so much, Mike. EMANUEL: Up next, states face tough choices as coronavirus cases increase across the country. We'll bring in a global public health expert to discuss what leaders can do to slow the surge next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) EMANUEL: This week, the U.S. hit a record for a single day spike in new COVID-19 cases leading into the Fourth of July. Even as many Americans dialed back their holiday plans, health officials are eyeing trends as we head into the fall and as states continue to reopen. Joining me now, the Director of the Harvard Global Health Institute, Dr. Ashish Jha. Dr. Jha, welcome to \"FOX News Sunday\". DR. ASHISH JHA, DIRECTOR, HARVARD GLOBAL HEALTH INSTITUTE: Thanks for having me on. Good morning. EMANUEL: Doctor, at least 20 states set record highs for average of new cases over seven days with Florida, Texas, California, Arizona, Georgia, and North Carolina tallying the highest number of new infections. Where are we in this COVID-19 fight and how do you explain the surge in new patients? JHA: Yes, so we're -- we're in a pretty tough spot right now. We have large outbreaks happening in large parts of our country. About two-thirds of the country is seeing increases in cases and we got here, Mike, because of a couple of reasons. One is I think we opened up a little too early in some places. A lot of states didn't meet the White House's own guidelines for when to open up safely. We didn't have the kind of testing and tracing infrastructure that we needed. And then last but not least, there's been a lot of mixed messaging on masks and social distancing and so all that has contributed to what I think is a perilous moment for our country. EMANUEL: According to The New York Times, new cases over the past 14 days are up 89 percent, while people dying is down 19 percent. Doctor, is that what you're seeing and how do you explain it? JHA: Yes, so what we know and this all -- first of all, it's always good news to see fewer people dying, right, and there are a couple of things that explain this. First of all, death is always a lagging indicator. By the time -- between the time somebody gets infected and takes a couple weeks before they get hospitalized and get really sick and another week or 10 days before they die. So death comes later. And I think a few things explain this. One is we are seeing increases in hospitalizations, so I worry that we are going to see an increase in deaths. Second is we're getting better at treating the disease. So we may have somebody who spends two or three weeks in the ICU and walks out, they're still going to be pretty sick with a lot of suffering but they're less likely to die. So I think it's a bunch of factors. Of course, the third is a younger population, which we know is less likely to die from this disease. So a combination of age, better treatment and the lagging indicator. EMANUEL: Any signs of COVID-19 weakening perhaps? JHA: There's a lot -- there's always talk about mutations and is a strain getting more virulent, less virulent, so far not really. No evidence that the virus is getting any less lethal. Thankfully no evidence it's getting any more lethal. But I do think doctors and nurses are getting better at treating it and we're getting some new therapies and that's helping. EMANUEL: Dr. Anthony Fauci painted a pretty dire picture this week on Capitol Hill. (BEGIN CLIP) DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES: We are now having 40 plus thousand new cases a day. I would not be surprised if we go up to 100,000 a day if this does not turn around. And so I am very concerned. (END CLIP) EMANUEL: Doctor, do you think it's that bad? JHA: Mike, you know, when he said that last week we were at about 40,000 per day, we are in the 50s now and heading in the wrong direction. So are we going to get to 100,000? It depends on us, right? If we act smartly, and we know what to do to prevent that -- if we do those things, yes, I think we can avoid it, but if we don't and kind of let this go the way we're going, I think 100,000 is entirely possible and that's what we have to avoid. EMANUEL: Stunning. In places where there are spikes, do you think they have to close down again? JHA: Well, you know, look, shelter in place, shutting down the economy, should absolutely be the last thing that you want to get to. And so you want to be aggressive on this and ahead of it. I am very worried as I look at data from parts of Texas and parts of Florida and Arizona that unless they get very aggressive, I don't really see how you stop the increases in this virus. I think some places are heading there and I think we're sounding the alarm because none of us want to go back to a shutdown. That's what we want to avoid. EMANUEL: Looking at the images of the president out at Mount Rushmore, a spectacular venue for the Independence Day holiday, with masks optional and no social distancing. Was that a mistake? JHA: Those are just risky things. Like any large gathering where people are not socially distancing and not wearing a mask is risky. Outdoors is better than indoors, so I was happy to see that, but my take is, the president should stick with the science here, encourage people to wear masks, you can build in a bit of social distancing. It would have made that safer. So this is just about risk management and I'm perplexed why we're not doing the things we can do pretty easily to lower the risk. EMANUEL: Every parent in America wants to know about schools reopening in the fall. You've talked about restricting bars, gyms, maybe even restaurants. Is that really the trade-off communities across the country must make? JHA: Yes, look, I am deeply worried about this. I have (ph) three kids who go to school and the last four months of them being out of school was pretty tough. I'm sure parents around the country are feeling that. And my point on this is if you -- if we see large outbreaks happening across communities, it's going to be very hard to keep schools open. The good news is we think kids transmit less. They are certainly less likely to get sick but if I -- imagine Arizona right now. If schools were open right now, they would not be able to stay open. So the number one task I think of governors around the country is get the virus under control or we're going to have schools shut down for many, many months this fall. And, obviously, none of us want that that. EMANUEL: What does school in the fall look like for much of the country? Are children of all ages going to be wearing masks all day? Is it realistic for first and second graders to keep a mask on all day? And how are teachers and students going to understand each other with masks on their faces? JHA: Yes, so that's a great question. Obviously schools range from kindergarten all the way through seniors in high school who are essentially adults. I think high schools, middle schools it's going to be easier, hopefully, to get kids to put on masks and keep them on. It's obviously going to get harder in elementary school. I think we're just going to have to make some trade-offs. My take is if you're in a community without a large outbreak, with low number of cases, you can probably get away without the little ones wearing a mask. We have got to also think about the fact that it's not just kids, our teachers and staff there. You can't run a school without teachers and staff so you got to protect everybody. It's going to be a challenge, but the single biggest thing that will help us out is if we keep the virus in the community at a low level. EMANUEL: The question everyone I know is asking, how optimistic are you that there will be drug therapies for COVID-19 and a vaccine in the coming months? JHA: Yes, so we've got two drugs that seem to work. They're both really for people who are pretty sick, Remdesivir and Dexamethasone. So these are for hospitalized patients who have substantial lung issues and evolvement (ph) already. Am I optimistic we're going to get an oral therapy that you can just take when you get sick? I'm not super -- look, a lot of clinical trials going on, I would love to be wrong. But the history of antiviral therapy is not a glorious one. We just have not been able to come up with oral drugs that will work super well. Vaccines I am very optimistic we're going to have one in early 2021. The challenge here, Mike, is that there are seven plus billion people in the world and there is going to be a race to vaccinate everybody. We're going to need billions of doses and I'm very worried about supply chains, about having enough vials and syringes and all the stuff. So I suspect spring to summer of 2021 before everybody's going to be able to get vaccinated in the United States. EMANUEL: And how effective would a vaccine be? Do you expect a vaccine that would work with just about everybody or are we talking about a limited percentage of success? JHA: Yes, that's a great question. Look, the good news here is we've got a ton of vaccine candidates, over 100. We've got more than a dozen in clinical trials. I'm guessing here, but my best guess is we won't have one vaccine, we'll have multiple vaccines that work. My best guess is that we'll have -- probably China might get to it first with a vaccine later this fall, but we're also racing, the Europeans are and my hope is that we'll have a vaccine that will at least stop you from getting very sick from the virus. So you may still get a mild -- you still might get mild disease but you won't get very sick. Also maybe the kind of vaccine where we need to get one every year. But that's fine. I get my flu shot every year. If I have to get a COVID shot every year, that's fine. EMANUEL: Dr. Jha, thank you. Thanks for your time. Please come back. JHA: My pleasure. Thanks for having me on. EMANUEL: Up next, the White House faces new pressure to explain when the president was told Russians may have offered money to Afghan militants to kill U.S. troops. We will speak to the leading Democrat on the Armed Services Committee when we come back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) EMANUEL: Coming up, President Trump cast doubt on allegations that Russians put bounties on U.S. troops in Afghanistan. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: I think it's a host for the newspapers and the Democrats. If it did happen, the Russians would hear about it and anybody else would hear about it, that was involved. (END VIDEO CLIP) EMANUEL: We'll ask Senator Jack Reed about the intelligence and the U.S. response, next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) EMANUEL: There was bipartisan outcry this week over reports rush offered bounties to Afghan militants to target U.S. troops. The administration says the intelligence is debatable. My next guest is pressing for cabinet officials to testify. Joining us now from Rhode Island, Democratic Senator Jack Reed, a former Army Ranger and the ranking member of the Armed Services Committee. Senator, welcome back to FOX NEWS SUNDAY. SEN. JACK REED (D-RI): Thanks, Mike. EMANUEL: Classified briefings at the end of this week about the possibility of Russian bounties on U.S. troops in Afghanistan. Reports are the administration is not planning to take any action in response. How concerned are you and what would you do to advise them to, you know, take action? REED: Well, I'm very concerned. And this is based upon just the public reports. If there's credible evidence that Russia is trying to entice Afghanis to kill American servicemen, that is a serious issue. Involvement of Russia in Afghanistan with the purpose of trying to kill individuals, American soldiers, is something that can't be accepted. It should have gone to the president. He should have been aware of it. In fact, there's some indication that it was in his presidential decision brief in the early part of the year, but he did not read it or did not pay attention to it. But that's the type of information that has to be seized by the president, because he's at the intersection of all the different roads of intelligence that come together. And, also, he's the one that's talking to Putin. He's had five or six conversations with Putin. And if this is an issue at all, even if it's one you just want to warn him away from not even thinking about, that discussion might have been very useful. EMANUEL: Republicans like your college Senator Joni Ernst of Iowa say leading Democrats, quote, had access to that same sort of information months ago, so what's the big deal? Is this a failure across our government, sir? REED: I -- it's not a failure across the government. The way the information is structured in terms of the presentation is first the president, as you would expect, every day gets a daily briefing, which is the most sensitive information that the intelligence community can come together. One of the things we've heard about President Trump is that he seldom reads them every day, maybe once a day, maybe once every three or four days, so there's, I think, a gap that has to be filled. And then there's another level of information, highly classified information, that goes to the big eight. Those are the -- the ranking Democrats. But the rank and file Democrats and rank and file Republicans don't typically get access to these kinds of very, very highly sensitive reports. EMANUEL: President Trump is threatening to veto the bipartisan National Defense Authorization Act over renaming military installations that bear confederate names. As a former Army Ranger who served it Fort Benning and Fort Bragg, what about this name issue? REED: I think we've finally come to grips with our history and we've come to grips with it in the appropriate way. This was a bipartisan initiative. It came out of the Armed Services Committee on a bipartisan basis. It wasn't a Republican initiative or Democratic initiative. It was supported by the committee by and large with very few exceptions. And it's coming to the floor of the Senate as a bipartisan initiative. And I think what it recognizes is that these individuals defied their country, abandoned their uniform, and fought against the United States of America. And to later on, and in many cases it was 50 or 60 years later, to name a post after these individuals does not represent what I think should be consistent with our, you know, honoring of American military heroes. The -- the factor, I think, that is important today is when you look at a post in the United States military, it is composed of men and women, it's composed of Americans of all different races. It cannot be named, I think, for someone who basically pledged his service to a system that was based on slavery. That has to be changed. And it will. It's a three-year process. At the end of those three years, with local import, with military import, with historic input, we will have a name, I think, that is much more fitting for the institution and for the history of the country. EMANUEL: As the ranking Democrat on the Armed Services Committee, what's the big picture impact if the president vetoes the defense authorization? REED: It would be reckless. He would be abandoning the -- the welfare of the troops, their pay raises, their quality living, the -- the housing improvements we've made, the platforms that they need, the -- the -- literally the ammunition that they'll need. All of it for not an issue that I think is comparable and indeed an issue which is being advanced on a bipartisan basis. This is not an example of the -- the -- the president responding to the cries of the entire country and -- and helping save us from ourselves. I mean when you have situations where the -- the assembly in the state of Mississippi chooses to recommend the elimination of the confederate battle flag, that show something about where the country is headed. And the president does not want to go and lead the country. He wants to pull them back. And that's wrong. EMANUEL: The Supreme Court's about to wrap its term. As always, there is speculation about possible retirements. What would be the impact of one or possibly even two retirements in this political season? REED: Well, first of all, I think a -- a justice that would retire for such a transparently political reason would have to think twice, I would hope. Second, it would be the height of hypocrisy if Mitch McConnell tried to drive a nomination through within a few months when he refused to allow Merrick Garland's nomination to come up for over a year when President Obama made the appointment. So I think what's -- and I think the court, because it should represent -- regard its reputation as paramount, I think they would be not particularly wise if they chose to do that and nor would Senator McConnell be, I think, appropriate in trying to ram through a nomination at this point. EMANUEL: Does President Trump have the right to fill one or more Supreme Court seats, particularly if they are conservative justices in this election year? REED: Again, I think it looks on precedent where you have a situation where President Obama certainly had the same constitutional right as President Trump and yet the -- Leader McConnell said, no, I'm not going to let you get your nominee up. So in terms of rights and responsibilities, they're the same. But I think what we have to recognize is, you know, what's fair, what's most deserving of the American people? I don't think they want to see a slapdash nomination of a Supreme Court justice in a few weeks. And I -- again, I think the court themselves, these justices, are extraordinarily eminent personalities. They've dedicated themselves to the law. And their last act to be something of looking like a political expedience is something I don't think that would be favorably viewed by history or by -- by their colleagues. EMANUEL: What can your side do to stop the president if he wants to go forward other than perhaps taking it to the American people, and what does that do to the already heated 2020 race? REED: Again, there are the constitutional provisions that if a seat is vacant on the court, the president has the right to do that. The Senate considers it. That's all there. Those are the mechanics. The reality, the substance is, this is close to an election. The American people want to go ahead and make decisions about their future, including the -- the future of their courts. And I think they should be allowed to do that. This is about letting America speak, not letting people who are conveniently located in the process to exercise their will. Let -- this is about the Americans speaking. EMANUEL: Senator Reed, how are you feeling about the Senate races this fall? Do you see perhaps Democrats taking back the majority in the Senate and perhaps you becoming the chairman of the Armed Services Committee? REED: Well, I feel very good. I think we have extraordinary candidates and I think they are working very hard. And I think one of the problems that my colleagues in the Republican side, and particularly the president, is that we see a situation where the Covid virus is not being effectively dealt with. It's causing huge economic problems. So you have a combination of a pandemic and economic disarray that is affecting every American. And I think, again, people want to see common sense solutions. And what we have seen from the White House has not been the kind of consistent, thoughtful use of the powers the president has. The powers initially to use the Defense Production Act to buy protective equipment so that all of our health care workers would be protected without excessive cost and without excessive delay. We haven't yet seen an aggressive testing program so that we can test throughout the United States so people feel confident that they know they don't have it, nor does anyone else they're likely to see. We've got a whole issue that we have to do in terms of making sure we can go back to school in the fall. I know you're talking to the expert from Harvard Medical School. That's going to be a real, serious challenge. We have to, right now, provide more resources, I believe, for our local schools and local states so that we can get children back to school. And if you don't have kids back in school, you don't have workers back in the workplace because who is going to take care of their children? None of this is being dealt with on a comprehensive, coordinated way. And that has been the situation since the very beginning. EMANUEL: All right. REED: The president has tried to ignore the problem. The president dismissed it. The president went out for his Fourth of July speech, who I think there's one phrase about Covid, when, in fact, Covid is probably -- and the economy are probably the two greatest issues. EMANUEL: Senator Reed, thank you. Thanks for your time. REED: Thanks, Mike. EMANUEL: Always good to speak with you. See you soon back on The Hill. REED: Likewise. Thank you. EMANUEL: Up next we'll bring in our Sunday group on the president's tough rhetoric over historical statues and the state of play in the 2020 campaign. We'll discuss when we come back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: There is a new, far left fascism that demands absolute allegiance if you do not speak his language, perform its rituals, recite its mantras and follow its commandments, then you will be censored, banished, blacklisted, persecuted and punished. (END VIDEO CLIP) EMANUEL: President Trump delivers a passionate and fiery speech Friday night, marking Independence Day at Mount Rushmore. And it's time now for our Sunday group. Former Republican Congressman Jason Chaffetz, Susan Page of \"USA Today,\" and Charles Hurt of \"The Washington Times.\" Panel, welcome. JASON CHAFFETZ: Good morning. CHARLES HURT, \"THE WASHINGTON TIMES\" AND FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Thank you. EMANUEL: Charlie, that sounded targeted at the president's base for months ahead of Election Day. Is it effective? HURT: I think it is because, you know, everyone is talking about try -- you know, whether the president wants to drag people back to history. It's really not about that. It's -- it's about freedom of speech. It's about the fact that people are being shut down in this environment. It's about people marauding in the streets and tearing down statues and doing it without going through any sort of legal process. And -- and people -- lawful, peaceful people sitting at home are watching this happen and -- and they have no voice. And so -- so it -- it really -- it goes much farther than just celebrating or -- or acknowledging our past, acknowledging a history. It has to do with upholding the rule of law and the concept -- the very principles and concepts that were -- were enshrined in the Constitution by these people that we choose to venerate and -- and -- and now we're watching their statues getting torn down. I think it's a very powerful thing. EMANUEL: Susan, what about reaching the political center? Does in the president need to broaden, expand his support in the closing months? SUSAN PAGE, WASHINGTON BUREAU CHIEF, \"USA TODAY\": Yes, you know, the -- I think -- I think Charlie's right, that this helps him with his base, which is so solidly for President Trump. But that does not get him to a majority of the electorate. And when we talk to voters, we find them talking not about cancel culture or the culture wars, we find them talking about Covid- 19, about the state of the economy and, to some degree, about this movement for racial justice where the majority of Americans in polls anyway tell us they feel sympathy, they are moved by these largely peaceful protests around issues like police violence. They do not see this as a battle against Marxism and anarchy. EMANUEL: Jason, what's your take on the present going to Mount Rushmore in the middle of this statue removal controversy? JASON CHAFFETZ, FORMER CONGRESSMAN (R-UT) AND FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, I know that the president went there in part because of an invitation from Governor Kristi Noem that started back in 2017. I think it was the right move. And I've got to tell you, I think Americans are tired. I think they're fed up with having the far left tell them that everything is wrong in America, that the statues you've been looking at, the history of the America -- of America is wrong and that the flag is something you shouldn't stand and salute and -- and I -- I just think America is tired of that. And I -- I think the president standing tall for America and saluting the flag, going to Mount Rushmore, is a good and positive thing and I think it will pay dividends and I don't think that Democrats and Joe Biden have an answer to that because it is just negative, negative, negative and it's not about the future. EMANUEL: Now there's also the effort to lay out camping strategy and define the opponent. Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale saying in a \"Washington Post\" op-ed, Biden wrote the 1994 crime bill. He championed China's entry to the World Trade Organization and he voted for the war in Iraq. He goes on to write, every single one of those major decisions that make up Biden's legacy contributed to the electorate's pushed back against the status quo. Charlie, is Biden's nearly five decades of public service a liability? HURT: I think it's -- I think it is a liability. And you have this strange dynamic where you have a sitting president who gets to run for re-election a second time as an outsider. You've got a guy like Joe Biden, who's been here for 47 -- been in Washington, been, quote/unquote, part of the problem for 47 years. It's a pretty hard thing. And -- and to listen to Joe Biden, well, you know, one of the sort of more amusing parts of this debate about -- that troubles -- I do think troubles a lot of Americans is to listen to Joe Biden talk about how he finally wants to see America address systemic racism. Well, he had eight years in - - in -- in the administration as vice president. You mean you did nothing during eight years to address systemic racism? We're only now finally addressing it? And then, of course, before he was in the White House, he was in Congress for 40 years. And-- and -- and this -- and so, you know, if -- if you do make the argument that there are all of these problems and that there are these systemic racism pervades every aspect of our -- our country, well, I mean, I don't know who you look to, to blame for that, but somebody who's been in Washington, part of the legislature for 40 years who was in the White House for -- for eight years. EMANUEL: Susan, how do you assess enthusiasm? Are Democrats fired up about Joe Biden or are they just motivated to get rid of President Trump? PAGE: Well, you know, we had a \"USA Today\"/Suffolk poll out this week that showed Biden with a 12-point lead. That's pretty -- a pretty muscular lead, but President Trump continued to have an edge on enthusiasm. President Trump's supporters were more -- much more enthusiastic about voting for him than Biden's supporters were about voting for Biden. But Biden's supporters were extremely enthusiastic about this. They were enthusiastic about voting against President Trump. So this is an election like some elections that we see with incumbents running for re-election where President Trump is defining both sides of this contest. He is the motivator both for those who are voting for him and for those who are voting for the other guy. EMANUEL: Jason, as a former chairman in the United States Congress, where does this Russia bounty story go and if top intelligence Democrats were briefed on it in February, how big of a failure is it across our government? CHAFFETZ: Well, I do think the administration needs to continue to provide information for Congress. Think Congress is right for asking for it. The question I have personally is, why do we still have troops in Afghanistan? I mean that -- that still bothers me, the longest war. The president promised we were going to bring those troops home. They can't kill them if they're not there. If we have actionable intelligence, go out and take them and kill the enemy. I don't have a problem with that at all. But I -- I -- I do think that there is more information that needs to be gleaned. I think that Nancy Pelosi and others trying to blame Donald Trump, that he's too close to Putin, that is so yesterday. We had a Mueller report. There is nothing to any of those stories and it's shameful that Nancy Pelosi would try to pain then on Donald Trump. I think that was totally wrong. EMANUEL: Susan, briefly, does this Afghanistan story have legs? PAGE: Yes, there is no issues that unites Americans of all stripes more than protecting our troops in battle. And I think a lot of Americans, on both sides, are looking for President Trump to address this, to criticize it and to say, if it's true, how is the United States going to respond and retaliate? That is something he has not yet done. EMANUEL: Charlie, final thought on this? Does this story go anywhere in the fall? HURT: I have a hard time seeing that it's going to make much of a difference in terms of the election. Largely because, you know, we've sort of been through this -- this fever dream that Republic -- that Democrats have pushed for four years now about Trump and Russia. And --and -- and it's -- and it underscores the perils of -- of trying to politicize absolutely everything. There are a lot of things that we don't know about this case, but -- but one thing is for certain, there are some very damaging leaks that are coming out of the -- the -- the government based on all this stuff and -- and, you know, that's -- those are -- those are serious problems. EMANUEL: Insight four months to Election Day promises to be a very spirited race to the finish line. Panel, thanks very much. See you next Sunday. CHAFFETZ: Thank you. EMANUEL: Up next, our \"Power Players of the Week.\" It's one of the Army's proudest and loudest units that fires those 21 gun salute for presidents. We will take you behind the scenes. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) EMANUEL: They are rarely seen, but you can certainly hear their work from miles away, members of the Artillery Unit that honors presidents and other dignitaries with remarkable precision. As Chris Wallace first told you last summer, they are our \"Power Players of the Week. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SFC. JOSHUA WOOD, U.S. ARMY: The Old Guard bases itself on perfection. SGT. DANIEL STEWART, U.S. ARMY: If we mess up, people know. So I like the fact that we tend to not do that. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Ready, (INAUDIBLE). WALLACE: Sergeant Daniel Stewart and Sergeant First Class Joshua Wood are members of the Presidential Salute Battery. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Standby. Fire. WALLACE: That fires cannons at all the big events in Washington, presidential inaugurations and funerals, special concerts, and visits by distinguished guests, and burials at Arlington National Cemetery. WOOD: When you are shooting for a president, like, that's -- that's the biggest -- that's like the Super Bowl. There is no room for error. The whole world is watching you. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Ready battery. WALLACE (voice over): We got a rare look behind the scenes -- UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Settle down. WALLACE: At the extraordinary precision in everything the PSB does. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Fire. WALLACE: There's a five-man staff and two men on each canon. The watchmen orders each fire. But in the echo of the booms, they found yelling one, two, three got lost. STEWART: Tap (ph). Three. (INAUDIBLE). Step (ph). Ready (ph). Cut (ph). WALLACE (on camera): And you do that every three seconds? STEWART: Every three seconds. Yes, sir. WALLACE (voice over): What if the watchman loses his voice? The PSB has a plan for that. STEWART: Top (ph). WOOD: (INAUDIBLE). WALLACE (on camera): He messes up, and now who does it? WOOD: The chief next to him. WALLACE: Because there's no room for error? WOOD: There's not. WALLACE (voice over): They guns are M-5 anti-tank canons from World War II, that saw action from North Africa to the Battle of the Bulge. Three teams are usually assigned to a ceremony. But if there's a misfire, there's a backup unit just in case. WOOD: My left hand is on my side. As soon as I lift it up, the back-up gunner, like you said, is looking at this hand. As soon as it moves, he pulls his lanyard (ph), which basically sets the gun off. WALLACE: And if there's another misfire, the backup crew has to be ready to go again. WOOD: As a loader, I'll load the rounds in three seconds, putting it inside the breach (ph). Close the breach (ph). And then re-fire. And the same process is done until the ceremony is complete. DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: So help me God. WALLACE: If you think that's overkill, it happened at the Trump inauguration. WOOD: There was actually two or three misfires during the inaugural honors that were being rendered. And I was loading fast enough that it didn't even skip a beat. It didn't sound like anything happen. WALLACE: The PSB is part of the Old Guard, the longest-serving active infantry unit in the Army, that's also charged with standing watch at the Tomb of the Unknowns, which brings us to watch they see as their main mission. WALLACE (on camera): With the military at war and some of your colleagues in actual combat, why is the Presidential Salute Battery important? STEWART: Every family that is in that cemetery, they only get one funeral, so it needs to be the best ceremony you can give. WOOD: You want to give them protection because their loved one served their country. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Stand by. STEWART: I -- I just -- I love it. The firing canons. I love the honoring the fallen. And just paying my respects. (END VIDEOTAPE) EMANUEL: Their precision and professionalism are pretty awesome. This year the team marked the holiday from a distance, firing cannons at noon yesterday, at Joint Base Meyer, Henderson Hall, across the river in Virginia. And however you are celebrating, we want to wish you a very safe and happy and healthy Independence Day weekend. And that's it for today. Chris is back next Sunday. Have a great week and we will see you next FOX NEWS SUNDAY.

I'm Greg Gutfeld, with Jesse Watters, Juan Williams, Dagen McDowell, and Emily Compagno, \"The Five.\"More rioting in Portland as Antifa barricaded doors to police buildings that court houses that taxpayers built, and then set the structures on fire, or as a media describes it, nothing special. Yeah, if you are looking for this on the news, good luck.It's tucked away behind slabs of Mary Trump's bitter psychoanalysis. But when the media's forced to cover it, they say the same thing. The response to riots is actually worse than the riots themselves. At CNN, apologists for rioting call right wing coverage of it a gross exaggeration.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: There are real problems in Portland that it is made up on Fox News like it is this raging fire out of control, and that is a gross exaggeration. It just is. It's a gross exaggeration.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUTFELD: That should be the name of his show. But it's nothing new. Remember CNN mocking the rise in violent crime?(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Democratic cities are in chaos right now. Is this what you want from Joe Biden? And they are going to take your country away, and they're taking down the statues.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And crime is rising --(CROSSTALK)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Oh my, gosh. It's so bad, de-funding police.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUTFELD: Wow, Beavis and Butthead. I guess to an idiot, that's funny. But remember it is the crimes that they mock that brings the police in to stop it, which increases the chances for encounters that can go wrong. But dismissing real violence in favor of mocking the concern for it saves them from examining their own role in protecting the mob and stoking violence. Oh, yes, I don't condone violence, they plea unless I agree with the violence.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And please. Show me where it says that protesters are supposed to be polite and peaceful. But I argue to you tonight. All punches are not equal, morally in the eyes of the law, yes. Fighting hate is right. And in a clash between hate and those who oppose it, those who oppose it are on the side of right.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUTFELD: So why this pathetic appeasement? Well, they are petty. If they would defend law and order, the police, or even you the citizen, that puts them on the same side as Trump. They would rather jump into bed with violence scum. CNN bends over backwards to hide the crime behind this media criticism. Claiming that covering the violence is meant to smear a movement and therefore condemning mayhem has to be racist.No, we say. We are just looking at what's happening to a country that we dearly love and are worried sick about it. We are actually scared. But go on and laugh. And then call 911 when this hell comes to your house. So I want to play this tape from the Portland Police Union Boss Daryl Turner, Juan, and then I want to get your reaction. Let's go.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Our elected officials have condoned the destruction of our city. They have placed their political agendas ahead of the safety of all of us and the welfare of the community. This must stop.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUTFELD: So Juan, what do you think local officials need to be doing now?JUAN WILLIAMS, CO-HOST: Well, I mean, local officials need to deal with local problems, Greg. That's the point here. I mean, I want to talk to you about two videos. I don't know if we have them. But one video is of David -- Chris David who was a veteran of the Navy. He appears before these unidentified federal groups, and he is wearing a Navy t-shirt.He has got a backpack on his back that says Navy. He just wants to talk. And they begin beating and gassing the man. How about a second video? This one of another man, Mark Pettibone, he is in the video walking away when an unmarked car shows up, grabs him, men in camouflage, again grabbing -- throwing him in an unmarked car. And he later says they just released him.So he is never charged with anything. He doesn't know who they were or what happened. So incidents like those are why you have the Oregon attorney general suing Homeland Security. It's why the ACLU is filing lawsuits. And these suits, they argue that local matters should be handled by local authorities. And the local authorities, the mayor, the governor, both senators want Trump's troops off the street.What they say is here is Mayor Ted Wheeler. He says the Feds are provoking violence, escalating the vandalism. Governor Kate Brown said this is political theater staged by Trump to divide the country and create a campaign issue, in which Trump can play law and order hero. But it is an abuse of federal power. And often times, I hear conservative say, hey, what about states rights, nothing this time.So I would just ask everyone. What are tactical units -- tactical units from border patrol and immigrations, customs doing in the streets of Portland, Oregon? That's an abuse of power.GUTFELD: Because anarchy means no one is safe and they are trying to preserve order. That's what it is there for. Emily, in Seattle, 12 cops were injured. There were more riots and looting. Of course, if we try stop that, we are invading a local problem according to Juan, right?EMILY COMPAGNO, CO-HOST: Well, I disagree, Juan, respectfully. What we are seeing on the streets, those are federal crimes. Throwing explosives falls under Title 18. That is a federal crime and deserves a federal response, because the local leadership is not doing anything. And they are not allowing that local law enforcement to protect its citizens.The full out attack on law enforcement and cities, that footage we are looking at. That is undeniable. And for these feckless, invertebrate governors and mayors to try to pivot to the national government and say that it's some type of federal overreach when they are failing their communities is absolutely ludicrous. We are watching a war on the streets.We are watching officers being killed. And I am one of those Seattle residents who is watching this city being destroyed alongside livelihoods, while Mayor Durkan and Mayor Wheeler play footsie with the mainstream media, or their insular socialist merry band of pilgrims, because they just want to get re-elected or answer to their small electoral.I have to point out that regardless how you feel about this president or this administration, we need help. These cities are being overrun by organized anarchists, while homeless and drug addicts are allowed to fester in these, quote, \"safe cities.\" All of these politicized nation needs to be put aside because we need help, and it is not coming from local leadership.GUTFELD: Jesse, you know that the local leadership is desperate if they are trying somehow to link their own incompetence to Trump, that somehow this is his fault.JESSE WATTERS, CO-HOST: Yeah. Federal agents are there to protect federal property. And they are not Trump's troopers. Juan, they are called Federal Protective Service. They are there to protect federal infrastructure. They are from the Department of Homeland Security. And the Hatfield courthouse is a federal district courthouse in the city of Portland.And it's been vandalized. They have had windows broken. They've had a bullet proof door smashed through with hammers. These anarchists are trying to literally take over a federal building. So they are there to protect the federal building. And when these federal agents are there to protect federal property, they've had lasers pointed into their eyes.And they have had commercial grade fireworks shot at them. These anarchists have tried to hit people with vehicles. And when you come in and take some away in a van. That's actually a traditional law enforcement de-escalation tactic. Because when someone assaults a federal agent or commits a crime on federal property, they need to be arrested. Now, there are two ways of doing that.You could send in a bunch of federal agents into a middle of a crowd of 100 anarchists and try to arrest an individual, or you can isolate them later when they are more alone and then make an arrest. That's how good policing is done. Now, it's also funny to hear the left complain about Trump sending federal agents anywhere after they send federal agents into the Trump campaign. That's literally what happened. They were OK with that. But, you know -- federal agents in Portland.GUTFELD: Yes, exactly, not just to protect citizens, but you can go after Trump. So Dagen, apparently, it is a look at -- our sin and violence is a local problem, but police brutality is a national or global concern.DAGEN MCDOWELL, CO-HOST: Right, exactly. Imagine being so unswervingly steadfast, like, anti-Trump that you are pro-crime. That violence and looting get double thumbs up from the clowns on some of these TV networks and their brethren running the states and cities in some of these areas. But it is an abomination to talk about enforcing the law and fighting crime.President Trump is actually standing up for his Constitutional duty. It is to take care that the laws be faithfully executed. And you know what, these losers in places like -- no disrespect, Emily, in Washington and Oregon are doing is they are turning their back on our Constitutional duty, because it is in the Tenth Amendment that the states have the right to stand up for the safety of their citizens and the actual duty to do that.And it's perfectly OK if federal crimes are being committed whether it is drug crimes or the Feds can prove a racketeering enterprise to go in with no invitation and no permission. But I push back on one thing, Greg. Those two are not Beavis and Butthead. That is an insult to Mike Judge.GUTFELD: That is true. I apologize to Mike Judge.WILLIAMS: Let me quickly throw this in there -- let me quickly throw this in there that I think local voters under that Tenth Amendment have a right to hold local officials accountable if they think they are not doing a good job. And those local officials want to get re-elected. So they are answering to their local constituents.And one other point, you know what. Police brutality against black people is a national problem. That's why it got national attention.GUTFELD: And so are riots, and so was looting, and so was violent -- wild spikes in violence. Coming up next, Trump with new blistering attacks on Joe Biden and why the president says he's feeling good about his re- election chances in November.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WATTERS: President Trump predicting a big 2020 win, while bashing Joe Biden, claiming that Sleepy Joe does not have what it takes to be president.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: You know why I want this, because the country in the end is not going to have a man who is shot. He is shot. He is mentally shot. I don't want to say that. I say that he is not competent to be president. To be president, you have to be sharp and tough and so many other things. He doesn't even come out of his basement.Joe does not know he is alive, OK? He does not know that he is alive. But let Biden sit through an interview like this, he will be on the ground crying for mommy. He'll say mommy, mommy, please take me home.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Trump also said he won't commit to accepting the results of the election in November. And you know, he said the same thing in 2016 as well. All right, Dagen McDowell, I'm sure that you watched the Chris Wallace- Donald Trump interview. What did you think on that?MCDOWELL: I'm just waiting for former Vice President Joe Biden to step up and do exactly the same thing, because he'd have to answer some questions about the two brain aneurysms that he had in the late 80s he wrote about in his book. Maybe seniors know something that we don't, because the poll numbers have moved away from him in the most recent Fox News poll.I can quote them. Last month, seniors went for Biden by 10 points. Now, they go for Trump by one. We've even at that (ph), but also, Joe Biden needs to answer for his own policies since he put out that manifesto. That's what Miranda Devine at the New York Post called it with Bernie Sanders recently. It's a treatous (ph) on job destruction and how to spike crime.He needs to answer for all of this if it -- more and more it appears that his policies are altered by other people who are great -- deal more radical than he is trying to behave.WATTERS: Yeah, Emily, so that is the line. You know, he is mentally shot and he's being taken over by the hard left. What do you think about that line of attack?COMPAGNO: Yeah. I think everything Dagen said was absolutely correct. My read on the interview -- it was an opportunity for Trump to critique Biden for obviously his left-wing lurch on climate policy, and also for him to lay out a vision of a second term. And I personally feel he got it half right. So he got in some jobs on Biden's rhetoric and his public policy proposals and the like.But he didn't take the opportunity to articulate really the priorities for a second term like he did in 2016, which was a clear immigration and trade policies and Obamacare focus. And I think right now, Americans, i.e. voters, the circumstances have changed. And that's what we need right now, is leadership. We need that articulation of what a second term would look like.Because he is obviously echoing what he did in 2016 against Hillary with all of the name-calling. But the circumstances have changed. And we need that leadership. Notwithstanding, again, what Dagen said and the humorous jobs at Biden, but ultimately, we all deserve a little better.WATTERS: All right. Greg, I want to play some Nancy Pelosi sounds about, I guess, Trump saying he won't accept the election results. And you can react to that.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)NANCY PELOSI, HOUSE SPEAKER: The fact is whether he knows it yet or not, he will be leaving. Just because he might not want to move out of the White House doesn't mean we won't have an inauguration ceremony to inaugurate the duly elected president of the United States. It has nothing to do with the fact that certain occupant of the White House doesn't feel like moving and has to be fumigated out of there.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Fumigated, Greg.GUTFELD: Yeah. That was Beavis and Butthead. I apologize, Dagen. Here's the problem with Nancy Pelosi is that she -- you know, OK, she can't wait until Trump is gone. But how long has she actually been in D.C. and in politics in general? So you have this fact that we have these old gibbering gas bags who can't wait for the skunk at the garden party to leave after only 3.5 years.He is not a politician. He -- they say his business, but he came and he won. And all of these elitists geriatrics can't wait for him to leave. What that tells you about the skunk at the garden party is that the skunk was on to them. And they hate the skunk. But what Trump has in his favor is fear. People are scared of saying that they are going to vote for him.We knew this was a variable in 2016. People did not want the grief of being harassed. Has that gotten better or worse? We know it has gotten worse, right? They are threats against Trump supporters. They're smeared entirely as racists by a blue checks on Twitter. If you wear a red hat anywhere in a Democratic setting, you're probably going to get beaten.So of course, there's going to be a massive invisible voting block out there that will probably turn this thing, into a bare minimum, of dead heat.WATTERS: All right, Juan Williams, what say you?WILLIAMS: Well, first thing, I think we should say to our colleague Chris Wallace. That was a phenomenal job. He fact-checked Trump in real time, and Trump didn't have answers. I think that's what we saw on live television. So to my mind, Trump then has to resort to smears against Biden's mental acuity just like he was smearing Anthony Fauci, just like he's -- in fact he smeared Fox News polling.But, you know, Trump is trying to tear down into Biden anybody -- everywhere that he can, because he is trying to distract people from the fact that his own failures when it comes to dealing with the Coronavirus, dealing with race relations, dealing with the economy. But the good news here is that the voters aren't buying it.The voters say that his attacks, even his attacks on Biden's mental acuity, falling flat. That Fox poll has voters 47 percent approved of Biden as mentally sound to handle the presidency. Only 43 percent say that about Trump. What about intellect, 51 percent of Americans say Biden has the intellect to be our president, only 42 percent for Trump.But here's the headline on the economy, where Trump used to lead, as better handling the economy now. Biden has a one point lead. I mean, that's an indication of how things are sliding for Donald Trump.WATTERS: Yeah. It's just I don't know why if Biden's so terrific and sharp, he wouldn't sit down for an hour with Wallace. It just doesn't make sense to me. Maybe he is not up to the task, maybe. We will see, Juan. Coming up, the FBI identifying the suspect in a horrific fatal shooting where a gunman targeted the home of a federal judge.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WILLIAMS: The FBI has identified a suspect in the murder of a federal judge's son. The Bureau is saying Roy Den Hollander is the quote, \"primary subject in the attack, and that he is now dead.\" Reports say he committed suicide. The man allegedly opened fire on Judge Esther Salas' home early Sunday evening, killing her 20-year-old son and wounding her husband.According to reports, the killer was dressed like a FedEx driver. The judge, she was at home at the time in the basement, and was not injured. Jesse, let me start with you. This is a very troubling case, because investigators say the man who did the shooting, now dead of suicide, was not a mobster, wasn't a gang member. There is no clear motive.All we know is that he filed a bunch of lawsuits in federal court. He was a self-described anti-feminist who sued over ladies' night drinks at bars and wanted women drafted for the military. What do you make of all this?WATTERS: Well, very confusing situation. I'm just so sorry for the judge to lose a son like that and to have her husband in critical condition. It's a heartbreaking situation. Attempts like this are rare, though. I think since 1949, there has only been three judges assassinated in the United States. But they really are sitting ducks when you think about it.I used to go out and ambush judges all the time. And I was able to come into very close contact with them at their homes, at restaurants, at the courthouse. You know, obviously, they need more protection from situations like this, as you said. This guy was a male rights attorney. Allegedly, he kind of got interested in this line of the law, because he married a Russian woman who then swindled him out of a lot of money.And filed kind of semi-frivolous lawsuits against universities for having women studies majors -- you know night clubs for ladies nights and things like that. He had a case, as you said, in front of the judge, because he didn't think it was Constitutional that only men were drafted. He wanted women to be drafted, too. But unfortunately, I don't think we're going to find out anything more about his motivations since he offed himself.WILLIAMS: Yeah, it's not clear. Emily, as a lawyer, let me ask you about protection for judges. You know, what Jesse is saying is true. I mean, even here in Washington, Supreme Court judges don't even have big entourages of securities. They move around. What is your experience with protection for judges?COMPAGNO: Right. That's a great question, Juan. And I will say that I have been only impressed by the level of security, including the FPS, with federal court buildings, courthouses, and buildings, and from my experience as a federal attorney. But I have to point out. I think the takeaway I would like viewers to understand is that it's not about sensationalist crimes.And whether judges are ruling on organized crime or sex trafficking rings, or even the more salacious cases, it is often simply that unhinged, unstable person who snaps. And it is unfortunate that no security is failsafe. But most importantly, I think is why as a nation we need to focus on mental health and red flags and warning signs. And if you see something, say something. That all of that also comes from mental health and mental stability, because when you read it out, you know, looking back, it seems sort of obvious this guy was totally unhinged. But if you take it one day at a time, then you can't see the pattern, you can't identify it, and you can't get that heightened sense of security.So I would just say that, again, it's always it's the lone wolf and it's always a mental health issue, unfortunately, that a lot of these violent acts stem from.WILLIAMS: So Greg, just again, picking up on this line of questioning about protection for judges. Her son, the judge's son as you know, 20-year-old, he was killed, and her and her husband, 63, he was injured, apparently now in pretty good shape, or at least we hope he'll survive.But I just wanted to ask you, the FBI initially said it's the husband, Mark Anderl, 63, who was being frequently threatened. Apparently, he had done some work for gangs like the Bloods and the Crips and things like that.GUTFELD: Yes, I think it goes back to your original point that like you think it would have been something to do with gangs or something to do with Epstein because that's the shiny -- that's the shiny bauble. And it turns out it's this unhinge crank.You know, this is -- this guy -- the name sounded familiar. And then I remembered that he sued a friend of mine, Jim Norton, maybe 10 years ago or 15 years ago, when Jim was on Opie and Anthony. And he had interviewed this guy who was a complete nut bag about men's rights, and the guy decided to sue Jim because the phone call was mean. And I think the case got thrown out and he ended up having to pay Jim Norton's legal fees. He was a complete nut bag.To the point about just the one of the lessons that you learn from these things, and very little that you can learn, is that we let our guard down whenever there's somebody in a uniform or a clipboard. It's just a weird thing that we just kind of assume that that person is there for a reason.And, you know, I walk around with the clipboard all the time, because I'm always, you know, taking notes, and people think I just generally am a contractor, you know, working as -- you know, when I walk in my neighborhood. And it's amazing how people just don't -- you can trick people with the simplest things. In this case, it was a FedEx uniform.WILLIAMS: That's -- I think what you just said is so true. And Dagen, just quickly, Greg mentioned the Jeffrey Epstein case. That was a case that the judge had been working on. She'd worked on a case involving a tax evasion case, involving one of the real housewives, but apparently none of that is why the shooting occurred.MCDOWELL: No, and people paid attention to this in part because the crime was just so horrific and jarring and blessings to the family. But because she's sitting -- she was assigned to it's an ongoing lawsuit brought by investors in Deutsche Bank over the bank's handling of Jeffrey Epstein's finances and alleging that they hid the activity of high-risk customers.She was appointed to that ongoing lawsuit or assigned to it just four days before the shooting. And I think that that, again, given the very suspicious circumstances of Epstein's death, that paying attention to that initially was justified. But it also raises the issue of why it's so important that we're able to arm ourselves and protect ourselves in our own homes under the Constitution.WILLIAMS: Yes. OK, up next, President Trump making a big announcement on the White House's response to the Coronavirus and what he just said about face masks. That's next for you on THE FIVE.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)COMPAGNO: Welcome back. The Coronavirus Task Force briefings are back. President Trump announcing they will restart tomorrow. As cases keep rising across the country, the debate over a national mask mandate continues to grow. Here's what the President is saying.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: Everybody was saying don't wear a mask. Well, all of a sudden everybody has got to wear a mask. And as you know, mask cause problems too. With that being said, I'm a believer in masks. I think masks are good, but I'll leave it up to the governors.(END VIDEO CLIP)COMPAGNO: And the President tweeting earlier that it is patriotic to wear a face mask. Dagen, we are Americans first. Your thoughts on the politicization of mask-wearing?MCDOWELL: Everybody, put a mask on for the love of the Lord. The CDC Director Robert Redfield said that he believes a pandemic could be brought under control of the next four to eight weeks if we could get everybody to wear a mask right now.Researchers from around the globe find that wearing at least something over your face is better than wearing nothing at all. And the President is going to prevent a fight by now trying to encourage people to wear masks.And ultimately, it's not up to the government. I think private businesses, what they're doing, say a Walmart saying, hey, you can't come in the store after July of 20th unless you have a mask on your face. That's really what's going to fix this thing.The government is so royally at every level, particularly the states like New York screwed up fighting this virus. Why do we want more government to try and fix it?COMPAGNO: Greg, oftentimes, the public reaction is more dangerous than the original threat. What are your thoughts on that?GUTFELD: I don't blame the public reaction in this case, because the people that were wrong the most were the experts. And Fauci was the expert and he was on many different sides of the mask debate. You can say he was wrong on masks or he lied about the masks in order to make sure that there were enough masks for health professionals by saying we didn't need them.And then there was the complete turnaround of the Surgeon General and the CDC. And all of a sudden, masks were everywhere. I was really a believer in masks, I still am. I think it's good to wear them. But you got to remember that everybody -- this is a -- this was a novel phenomenon, and everybody has a right to be wrong as long as they correct their mistakes quickly.Fauci made another mistake by saying what -- you know, praising New York for their good job. The only reason why the state appears to do well is because it did so horribly at the start, right? It's easy for your death rate to drop when it was high for so long and it's because you just ran out of victims.So Fauci was wrong as much as he was right, and Trump listened to the experts. And lastly, anybody who's a critic, I would love to hear what they would have done better than Trump because no one has anything.COMPAGNO: Juan, why are Democrats calling for a federal intervention for this public health emergency when they are decrying federal intervention for the public safety emergencies afflicting their major cities?WILLIAMS: Well, I think there's a clear distinction here. There's no -- the pandemic doesn't know any local boundaries, so it's a something that really, I think cries out for leadership and reliance on the kind of guidance we can get from people at the National Institutes of Health or the Center for Disease Control, that's why we have those agencies to serve us all.But I mean, the thing is, in the interview yesterday with Chris Wallace, you see the president saying, you know, I'll eventually be right, eventually this thing will go away, or most people who get this especially young people, it's nothing more than a cold. You think, what is going on, why is the president saying these things at a time when, in fact, the rate of infection over the last 41 days, the seven-day average for infections have been going up?The fact is, 137,000 people have died and the rate of death is going up again for the first time since March. And I think that's why Americans wonder what's going on with the President on this. I'll see what he does with these new briefings, but he's got to understand the buck stops here. You can't blame the Chinese, Obama, Fauci, Cuomo, that's just doesn't work anymore.GUTFELD: Yes, you can.COMPAGNO: Jesse, your thoughts.GUTFELD: Yes, you can.COMPAGNO: Jesse, your thoughts on the president resuming his daily briefings.GUTFELD: Look at the Democratic states. There -- that's where the death is.WATTERS: Yes. And Juan doesn't want the presence of blame China. I wonder why, Juan. Yes, no, I'm really excited the President is going to be doing the briefings. He's the commander in chief, we're at war with the virus. We're still at war with the virus, and he's going to be updating the American people on vaccines, on therapeutics, on the robust federal response, sending teams into hotspots beforehand.A lot of people in Texas, in California, Arizona want to hear from the President about school reopenings. And it's good if he's going to have Fauci or Birx or whoever there, Hahn, on the vaccine to take questions. Americans are really thirsty for more information.And the President as long as he keeps it informational, not too confrontational. And he doesn't have to do two hours, but he doesn't have to do zero minutes either. You know, maybe half hour and say I got to run. I got to hop on a phone call and we can get back to \"The Five.\"COMPAGNO: All right, speaking of which, stay with us, the \"Fastest Seven\" is up next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)MCDOWELL: Welcome back. Time for the \"Fastest Seven.\" First up, Mark Zuckerberg laying the sunblock on pretty thick. He looks like the Silver Surfer this weekend in Hawaii. Greg, it's not the Marcel Marceau makeup, it's the fact that he's surfing in a soaking wet blue hoodie.GUTFELD: You know, in about 30 years, he's going to have to answer to wearing white face and it's going to be pretty, pretty disturbing.MCDOWELL: Emily?COMPAGNO: Oh my God, Dagen, that was so funny, the Marcel Marceau. I just feel bad like shaming him because I feel like people like who are pale. I mean he probably like gets super sunburned. I don't know. He's just a dweeb.MCDOWELL: Jesse clearly does not do this.WATTERS: False. That happened to me one time in Outward Bound where I got a scorching sunburn and my counselor made me put zinc oxide all over my entire face. And mosquitoes would just fly in and lodge themselves, other campers were throwing twigs and sticking them into the face. It was a horrible experience so I sympathize with Zuckerberg.MCDOWELL: Juan, he's one of the richest men in the world. Zuck can do whatever he wants to.WILLIAMS: I guess so. By the way, that location there on the north side of the island, I think is one of the most beautiful places in the world. I can understand why he lives there. I'm with Jesse on the sunscreen, because you know I use that zinc stuff on my face and I am mocked by my grandchildren. They just think that I am the silliest person ever, but it keeps the sunburn away.WATTERS: Yes.MCDOWELL: Up next, we've got a close call in Florida. Watch this off duty cop not wasting any time assessing the situation. He immediately springs into action to save a young man on a boogie board from a shark swimming dangerously close to the shore. Jesse, you'd do this?WATTERS: I wouldn't but that's why we have police, Dagen. And the Democrats want to do this guy. You know what, he wouldn't have been able to do this if he had -- you know, the Democrats would have taken as funding.MCDOWELL: Juan?WILLIAMS: I think he was off duty, Jesse. I think he did it because he's a good man and he was caring about that young man.MCDOWELL: Emily?COMPAGNO: OK, this is related, but I used to live in a 600-person beach town, and one of the local surfers got beaten by --bitten by a shark, and his -- the scar was like literally his torso down to the -- to right above his knee.And the whole point is that he was the only one without insurance and it just forever reminded me of like a Far Side Gary Larson cartoon which is like the sharks underwater being like, who can we get that doesn't have insurance. It makes sense in my head.GUTFELD: How do we know that that shark wasn't there trying to help him? We're like -- we're just assigning blame without even knowing the whole story and it makes me sick.MCDOWELL: Sharks as helpers. Finally, moving on to another animal, this hiker in Mexico is either cool or crazy posing for a selfie with a black bear that wandered onto her trail. Juan, I can give people tips on how to deal with a bear if they encounter them in the woods, because you're supposed to get in a ball and put your hands over your ears so they don't tear your ears off, but this woman clearly didn't know that.WILLIAMS: Is she -- is she like a superhero or something. I mean, how can she be so calm, Dagen? I mean, I would be like, I'm out of here.MCDOWELL: Yes, Emily, would you run?COMPAGNO: Well, no, because I think we're not supposed to. But I just see that it's totally biting the bear like sniffing her hair.MCDOWELL: Jesse?WATTERS: Well, it's either fake or what they tell you to do in the wild is if a bear attacks, I think you're just supposed to be still. It's either that or you're supposed to climb a tree or wave your hands and wild motions and scream. To one of those three, it looks like she chose the right one.MCDOWELL: Greg, it did look like somebody wearing a bear costume.GUTFELD: Yes, can you throw that up there again, just real quick. I want to just take a look at it before we go. If I could just see the actual -- I'll just keep talking until they show it. As you can see, obviously, it's Alec Baldwin. He's known for having tremendous back hair. He has a tremendous back hair and he's a nudist. So he's actually out there exposing himself to this poor woman, and Alec Baldwin is a pervert.MCDOWELL: I'm familiar with the hair suit and you might be right. \"ONE MORE THING\" is next.GUTFELD: Yes.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)GUTFELD: It's time for \"One More Thing.\" Juan?WILLIAMS: Thanks, Greg. Today, let's give tribute to the late John Lewis. When Lewis ran for Congress in 1986, he described his opponent as a showboat. He said he was a tugboat willing to work for the American people. Well, that tugboat, that underdog, won the race and served in Congress until his death last week.Three things stand out in my mind when I think of John Lewis. In 1960, he was one of the founders of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee. They protested against segregated lunch counters, also led the Freedom Riders throughout the South. On one of those rides, Louis was badly beaten in his home state of Alabama.And in 63, then-23-year-old John Lewis spoke right before Martin Luther King at the March on Washington. That young John Lewis had to be reined in by Dr. King, but his remarks were the perfect prelude for the now famous I Have a Dream speech. And then in 1965, Lewis was one of the folks who led a march for voting rights from Selma to Montgomery. State troopers attack the marches, fracturing Lewis' skull.That's -- this man of history was also a good friend to me. He offered words of endorsement that appear on the back of my last book. So today, I just want to say God bless you, John Lewis. You are an American who personified the words of public servant.GUTFELD: Well done, Juan. Emily.COMPAGNO: First, a special Happy Birthday to Lieutenant Tom Daly of rescue two of New York's bravest. He's the recipient of the Shelly Rothman Memorial medal. He's a friend of the show, but most importantly, he's a member of Raider Nation. Happy Birthday Lieutenant and thank you for your service.I wanted to draw your attention for a moment on a special diner called Ryan's Place in Epping, New Hampshire. It was opened by a Gold Star Mother after her son Ryan McDermott was killed in action in the U.S. Army in the Middle East and it has now fallen on hard times. It has been described as the heart and soul of that community. And if you go to the stories in my Instagram, you can learn more about it and help save this diner.GUTFELD: All right, quickly, let us do this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GUTFELD: Animals are great. Animals are great. Animals are great.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUTFELD: What's a Monday without some great animals? That's right. It's a bird, it's a plane, no, it's a seagull chased stealing a purse. There you go. That's -- I tried to imitate Juan but did terrible job. Look at that. He just made off with this woman's purse. Yes, the seagull had some slippery fingers. Yes, there you go. Yes, there you go. Apparently, she went to Louis Vuitton and bought some shoes with --- on her credit card. All right, Jesse, you got a minute. You need to split with Dagen.WATTERS: Yes, I mean liberal cities running wild. You know, they're not even going to arrest that looting seagull. It's horrible. All right, there's no sports on television to watch except for golf or NASCAR. So, what better thing to do than watch a retired football player throw kids into a pool.That's James Harrison right there with some WWE moves. Look at this. How fun does that look? I mean, it's like 100 degrees here in New York. I think I want him to do this to me right now. Look at that, boom, soaking wet.GUTFELD: I think he would like to do that. You know, Jesse, I think he would like to do that to you.WATTERS: I'd like to do that to you, Greg.GUTFELD: But probably not in the pool.\n", "comment": "", "topic": "TRANSCRIPT", "date": " July 20"}, {"cover": "https://a57.foxnews.com/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/694940094001/992ea599-6d2d-4029-a700-8116c1c74597/5d3730dc-a664-4106-9813-847a62a2c67b/1280x720/match/156/88/image.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "title": "Tale of the tape: State of Trump 2016 campaign promises", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/transcript/tale-of-the-tape-state-of-trump-2016-campaign-promises", "subtitle": "Jul 28, 2020 ...

I'm Shannon Bream in for Bret Baier. President Trump has just concluded a news conference from the White House. He says large portions of the country are corona-free. The president adds, cases in hot zones are heading down. But the briefing was not all about coronavirus. Chief White House correspondent John Roberts was at today's session and starts us off tonight. Good evening, John. JOHN ROBERTS, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Shannon, good evening to you. Some of the biggest news out of the White House today is the fact that the Department of Homeland Security is going to undertake a thorough review of the so-called DACA program, the dreamers' Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals to determine whether that program should continue and if it shouldn't continue, how to wind it down. In the meantime, the Department of Homeland Security will not be taking any new initial applications for new DACA recipients. The renewal for the DACA program will be done on a case by case basis. And the period of renewal would be reduced from two years to one year. And unless it's extraordinary circumstances, current DACA recipients will not be able to leave the country. Now, when the president first heard about the Supreme Court decision regarding DACA, he suggested that he was going to implement a fix that may include a path to citizenship for current DACA recipients. I asked him about that at the briefing a short time ago. Listen here. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We are going to make DACA happy in the DACA people and representatives happy and we're also going to end up with a fantastic merit-based immigration system. (END VIDEO CLIP) ROBERTS: One of the other big topics of course at the briefing this afternoon, hydroxychloroquine back in the news again after the president late last night retweeted a tweet that was critical of Dr. Anthony Fauci claiming that he had misled the nation about the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine. This tweet suggesting that it was more effective than what the National Institutes of Health, other research organizations and Dr. Fauci had been saying about it. Dr. Fauci responding this morning on \"Good Morning America\". Listen here. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH: I just will continue to do my job no matter what comes out because I think it's very important. We're in the middle of a crisis with regard to an epidemic a pandemic. This is what I do, this is what I've been trained for my entire professional life and I'll continue to do it. (END VIDEO CLIP) ROBERTS: That briefing this afternoon, President Trump again saying it is possible that hydroxychloroquine combined with zinc and azithromycin may be an early particularly -- or maybe an effective early stage treatment for coronavirus. The president also lamenting why a recent A.P. poll showed that Anthony Fauci had much higher personal ratings than the president did. Listen to his response here. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: He's got this high approval rating, so why don't I have a high approval rating with respect and the administration with respect to the virus? We should have a very high -- (END VIDEO CLIP) ROBERTS: And the new phase for Coronavirus Relief Bill, the HEALS Act, of course, a big topic of discussion here in Washington today as the Senate Republicans roll out their program. President Trump said there are things about it he likes, there are some things about it -- about it he does not like but it's certain that Democrats do not like the provision on unemployment insurance which reduces the plus up which is currently at $600 a week down to $200 a week. Listen to what the Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said about it earlier this afternoon. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY): People can't feed their kids. People are losing their homes, they get kicked out from their apartments, small business going under. And the Republican response let them eat cake. (END VIDEO CLIP) ROBERTS: Negotiations are under way on Capitol Hill. The White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, the Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin meeting with Nancy Pelosi during the day today. It's going to be a tough lift though, Shannon, because they seem to be so far apart in terms of money and how that money is divvied up. I think it would be a miracle if they can get something done before some of this runs out. They may have to do it piecemeal because of course, that unemployment insurance which runs out at the end of this month, that's something's got to be done about that or there's going to be a lot of people who don't have any money to buy anything, Shannon. BREAM: Yes, both sides seem to be suggesting there's not a ton of progress as you said today. John Roberts at the White House. Thank you, John. ROBERTS: You bet. BREAM: Attorney General William Barr says violent rioters and anarchists have hijacked legitimate protests to wreak senseless havoc and destruction on innocent victims. Barr mounted a vigorous defense of the administration's response and his relationship with the president before an often-hostile House Judiciary Committee today. Correspondent Gillian Turner shows us what happened. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Mr. Barr, if I may -- WILLIAM BARR, U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL: Yes, but this is a hearing, I thought I was the one that's supposed to be heard. GILLIAN TURNER, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT: The attorney general struggled at times to defend his record amid the Democrat majority's relentless interrogating. But his main message was loud and clear, when it comes to delivering justice, he insists he's never done President Trump's bidding. BARR: He has told me from the start that he expects me to exercise my independent judgment to make whatever call I think is right and that is precisely what I've done. TURNER: House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler delayed by a traffic accident enroute to the hearing set the tone for Democrats attacks in his opening line. REP. JERRY NADLER (D-NY): You have aided and abetted the worst failings of the president. This administration has twisted the Department of Justice into a shadow of its former self. TURNER: But Barr insisted he's only ever sought equal justice for the administration. BARR: I agree the president's friends don't deserve special breaks but they also don't deserve to be treated more harshly than other people. TURNER: Republican Jim Jordan slammed Democrats saying for them, it's always been about the Russia hoax and always will be. REP. JIM JORDAN (R-OH): Spying, that one word. That's why they're after you Mr. Attorney General. They've been attacking you ever since, every day, every week for simply stating the truth that the Obama-Biden administration spied on the Trump campaign. TURNER: Talking about protests for racial justice, Barr put a partisan spin on violence in American cities. BARR: The Democratic Party are not coming out and condemning mob violence and the attack on federal courts. Could we hear something like that? TURNER: He also singled out Antifa for fomenting violence. BARR: We are concerned about this problem metastasizing around the country. TURNER: As for the demonstrations in front of the White House last month when officers forcefully removed protesters from Lafayette Square, Barr defended his actions denying it was done to give Trump a photo op at a nearby church. BARR: To say that this had to do with a photo op but it's akin to saying that we invaded the Philippines in World War II, so Douglas MacArthur could walk through the surf on the beach. (END VIDEOTAPE) TURNER: Looking ahead to the November election, Barr says he assumed Russia is trying to interfere. He differs from President Trump who has said he believes 2020 will be rigged by increased mail in voting. Barr said today, he's got no reason to think that's the case, Shannon. BREAM: All right, we'll break it down with the panel coming up. Gillian Turner on Capitol Hill, thank you. A declassified report from the Senate Intelligence Committee is revealing internal conversations about the Steele dossier between the FBI and CIA during the writing of an Intelligence Community assessment on Russian election interference, a potential collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. The report reinforces the deep divide regarding how much stock the Intelligence Community put into this deal information well before the three renewals of the Carter Page FISA warrants. The head of the U.S. Park Police is denying that his officers turned violently on protesters and journalists during that Lafayette Square confrontation mentioned in our last report. Gregory Monahan told a House Committee today, there was zero correlation between the abrupt clearing of the area and President Trump's surprise appearance shortly after. Well tonight, we get the inside story on defending a federal building under attack. National correspondent William La Jeunesse shows us how federal officers are trying to protect government property and themselves in Portland. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) WILLIAM LA JEUNESSE, FOX NEWS CHANNEL NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Another night of protests outside the federal courthouse in Portland as officers inside gave a final warning. Federal agents opened the courthouse doors facing a barrage of bottles and fireworks. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: By no means is this a peaceful protest. It starts to knock the night off like that. But eventually it's taken over by what we're -- you know, their violent opportunists who are using this peaceful protest to take over. LA JEUNESSE: After weeks of media coverage focusing on the protesters, Fox was given a behind the scenes look at the federal agents who are defending the building. Protesters called the agents' actions unnecessary excessive and dangerous. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: if I exhale hard enough, you could see, like, a cloud of smoke come out of it. LA JEUNESSE: In recent days, federal agents have seized Molotov cocktails, bats, hockey sticks, slingshots, cans and garden sprayers filled with bleach and urine. BARR: We are on the defense. It's -- we're not out looking for trouble. And if the state and the city would provide the law enforcement services and other jurisdictions, still, we would have no need to have additional marshals in the courthouse. LA JEUNESSE: Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler for weeks criticized the feds as a paramilitary force attacking democracy. But Monday, he called for an immediate meeting with acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf to consider a ceasefire. U.S. Marshal Russell Berger who commands officers on the ground prefers cooperation to confrontation. RUSSELL BERGER, U.S. MARSHAL: I think that anytime leaders get together and try to find solutions, that's a good thing. (END VIDEOTAPE) LA JEUNESSE: While there are encouraging signs coming out of the local NAACP, the U.S. attorney's office and city hall, there's no reason to believe that what we saw last night won't happen again tonight, Shannon. BREAM: We will be watching. William, thank you. So, let's get reaction to all of this from House Judiciary Committee ranking member Jim Jordan of Ohio. Congressman, good to see you. JORDAN: Good to be with you, Shannon. BREAM: All right, you got a lot of attention in this hearing today for a mash up, a video that you ran showing some of the riots around the country, some of the protests that have turned violent. JORDAN: Yes. BREAM: Here's how NBC reports on it. It says, the video that you played omitted images of federal law enforcement officers and members of the military taking aggressive action against protesters. Democrats said you didn't clear the video in advance as you should have. How do you defend that tonight? JORDAN: Well, Democrats want to censor Republican members of the Judiciary Committee just like the hard left wants to censor conservatives around the country. I mean, the video speaks for itself. You have -- you had two reporters in that video saying these are -- these are peaceful protests while there's a building burning in the background for goodness sake. So, we just presented the truth. We wanted to make sure the American people saw what is really happening in these cities. Portland has been under siege. The federal building in Portland as Bill Barr testified today, under siege for almost nine weeks, 61 straight days. And Bill Barr did a great job today. He's doing a great job as attorney general but he asked a fundamental question, why won't the Democrats condemn the mob? Why won't they condemn the rioters? Why won't they condemn what's happening to the federal building in Portland? And when we ask him would that federal building be standing today but for federal officers defending it, he said, no it would not. Would St. John Church be standing today but for actions by the federal government? No, it would not. That's the fundamental issue that Americans see it. The ones who don't are Democrat leaders in Congress and Democrat mayors around the country. BREAM: Well, the House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler had a lot to say today to you and to the attorney general. And he said the president is leveraging these images to try to help himself get reelected and accused the attorney general of doing the dirty work for him. Here's a bit of their exchange. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) NADLER: You used pepper spray and truncheons on American citizens. You did it here in Washington. You did it Lafayette Square. You expanded to Portland and now you are projecting fear and violence nationwide in pursuit of obvious political objectives, shame on you Mr. Barr. (END VIDEO CLIP) BREAM: What did you make of the newest accusations that came from Democrats who said just not on this issue but on several? The attorney general has covered for and protected the president in a way that they find unlawful. JORDAN: The attorney general is enforcing the rule of law. And if Democrats want to try to blame the attorney general for what is happening in Democrat-run cities that have been Democrat-run for years and years, I think the last time there was an elected Republican in Portland was 1956. They want to try to blame the administration for that, they're just flat out wrong. How about the -- how about the police chief in Seattle who sent a letter to the residents and the business owners in Seattle and said, the City Council just passed something that doesn't allow our officers to protect you from violent crowds. I'm putting you on notice. We will have to do a quote, adjusted deployment, which was a nice way of telling those business owners and residents, we're not going to be there. We would love to be -- Carmen Best, the police chief, she was doing what you're supposed to as a leader. She was -- she was trying to serve the constituents, serve her -- the people in her city. But she had to tell them, look, they're tying our hands. I would like to help you but the Democrat controlled nine -- excuse me, eight Democrats and one socialist on the Seattle City Council are making it tough for us to do our job, we're warning you. That's what Bill Barr is criticizing. That's what's wrong. And all we -- all we did is point out what is happening in so many of our major -- in the United States of America. This kind of stuff is going on. That is -- this idea -- and Bill Barr talked about this, this idea of defunding the police, it is dangerous. And he said that, we showed that, that's what the focus of this hearing was about. That's what he said -- that's what needs to be cleaned up. BREAM: Well, and quickly, we showed the clip a little bit earlier when he said this is a hearing, I thought I was supposed to be here to be heard. But what any neutral observer could see when they watched today is that Democrats would ask questions and when he would began explaining beyond a yes or no answer, they immediately would say I reclaim my time. Meaning, the member is the only one who could speak, then the attorney general couldn't. Do you think this hearing was beneficial today and why do you think he decided to walk into that situation knowing it would probably go that way? JORDAN: No, I mean, look, he did a great job in spite of the fact they tried to -- try to not even let him speak. I mean, you think about this hearing, the Democrats cut off or they wouldn't show our whole video. The Democrats wouldn't let the attorney general answer questions and then they tried to stop him from taking a restroom break for goodness sake. That's the treatment the Democrats give the attorney general of the United States. It is -- it is wrong. American people saw it for what it was. They appreciate the work I think -- I think the vast majority of the people in this country appreciate the work that President Trump is doing, appreciate the work that the attorney general is doing. And we just tried to underscore that and show that to them today. BREAM: Congressman Jim Jordan ranking member on House Judiciary. We're going to dig in this -- into this with the panel. I'm sure they will have a lot to say about it. Thank you for your time sir. JORDAN: You bet, Shannon. Thank you. BREAM: OK, up next, the lengths some parents are going to make sure their kids get an in-person education. First, here's what some of our Fox affiliates around the country are covering tonight. FOX 28 in Columbus as Republican state representatives in Ohio meet for the first time since their leader was arrested in connection with a $60 million federal bribery probe. They're discussing whether to remove House Speaker Larry Householder and what the investigation's fallout might mean for their fall legislative campaigns. FOX 5 in New York as ridesharing scooters startup Revel says it's suspending operations in the city after a second fatal crash in less than two weeks. Revel says it is reviewing safety and rider accountability measures. And this is a live look at San Diego from FOX 5. The big story there tonight, test samples reveal toxic chemicals in the smoke from the fire aboard the USS Bonhomme Richard, despite the Navy's claim that the smoke was not toxic. The San Diego County Air Pollution Control District says, toxic chemicals were found but not at levels that would cause any health concerns. That is tonight's live look outside the Beltway from SPECIAL REPORT. We'll be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BREAM: The CDC is reporting nearly 55,000 new cases of coronavirus Monday. That brings the total in the U.S. to more than 4.3 million with almost 150,000 deaths. Major League Baseball has postponed games for the Miami Marlins until at least next week. The number of infections on the team now stands at, at least, 15. Dr. Anthony Fauci says the outbreak could threaten the season. And Airline Industry Trade Association says it's going to take until 2024 to return to pre-pandemic levels. That is a one-year extension of the previous prediction. The nation's second largest teacher's union says it will support members who go on strike because of unsafe working conditions due to the pandemic. And more districts are going virtual. Students in Philadelphia and Columbus, Ohio learned today they will start the new semester online. As more and more schools make plans for virtual education to start the coming school year, some parents are trying to make sure their kids get in- person instruction. Correspondent Laura Ingle shows us how tonight from Malvern, New York. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ELIZABETH BERGMAN, PARENT: In 2020, we are all looking to pivot. This was an idea that just came to us to continue the path of education and in person instruction for our children. LAURA INGLE, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT: The idea set up their own small group or pod of students to continue lessons outside the regular school setting. It's a trend around the country as parents face uncertainty about whether schools will open in the fall. They're hiring teachers to hold many classes outside or at one another's homes. Parents say it's been beneficial. BERGMAN: They picked right back up especially at the younger ages. They thrive on routine and on this classroom setting. INGLE: A recent Fox poll shows two-thirds of those surveyed want children to attend public schools in person this fall to some extent, while 25 percent would prefer to be fully remote. Another tool parents are using to ensure kids don't fall behind is supplemental online classes. ANDREA TOCH, PARENT: We want them engaged and with no arts and no music and no recess. This is a really good way to kind of still that time doing things they love. INGLE: The U.S. Department of Education is warning parents and schools to be prepared for whatever fall brings. FRANK BROGAN, ASSISTANT SECRETARY, EDUCATION DEPARTMENT: Don't develop one plan, develop multiple plans because you're going to be surprised to find out nothing is going to work for a one size fits all approach to this thing. (END VIDEOTAPE) INGLE: The money to fund private pot instruction learning space and child care are all major issues that some parents say will not come easy as they try to manage their own jobs to keep their families afloat, Shannon. BREAM: Laura, thank you. Well, stocks were down today. The Dow lost 205. The S&P 500 fell 21. NASDAQ gave back 134. The House Judiciary Committee will hold a hearing tomorrow on the domination of Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google. Many of the industry's top leaders are expected to testify including Jeff Bezos of Amazon and Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook. The hearing was postponed last week after the death of Congressman John Lewis. Well, up next, Joe Biden tells us when he will be announcing his vice presidential candidate. First, Beyond Our Borders tonight. North Korean leader Kim Jong-un says his country's hard-won nuclear weapons are a solid security guarantee. State media report, Kim told Korean War veterans, the weapons are a reliable and effective deterrence that could prevent a second Korean War. Two bases in the Middle East housing U.S. troops and aircraft went on high alert when Iranian missiles appeared to be headed for them. The U.S. Central Command says American service members at bases in the United Arab Emirates and in Qatar were told to quickly find shelter when several missiles were fired from Iran. Ultimately, the missiles landed well shorts and out to sea. The launches were part of an Iranian military exercise in the Persian Gulf. Preparations conclude for a very different observance of a major Muslim holiday at the Grand Mosque in Mecca. It would normally be packed with more than two million pilgrims, but only a thousand to 10,000 are being allowed to come this year because of the coronavirus. To some of the other stories Beyond Our Borders tonight. We'll be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BREAM: In tonight's Democracy 2020 segment, Joe Biden sets the timetable for announcing his pick for a running mate. He also unveiled the latest package of promises should he be elected in November. Correspondent Doug McKelway shows us what the Democrat is proposing and who's helping him get into a position to deliver. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I'm going to have a choice in the first week in August, and I promise I'll let you know when I do. DOUG MCKELWAY, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT: Back on the trail, but sticking close to home at an inner-city Community Center in Wilmington, Joe Biden said he will reveal his running mate next week. The announcement came as the former V.P. unveiled the fourth and final plan of his Build Back Better economic recovery plan today. BIDEN: It's about rising in this moment of crisis. Understanding people's struggles and building a future worthy of their courage and their ambition to overcome. MCKELWAY: It's a 26-page of wish lists covering anything from helping black and brown farmers purchase land, to providing $150 billion in new capital for small businesses who've been, quote, structurally excluded for generations. How to pay for it? It's doubtful any Republican Congress would agree, Biden's counting on Democrats taking control. BIDEN: If I'm elected and this passes, I'm going to be good to go down as one of the most progressive presidents in American history. MCKELWAY: He accused President Trump's remedies of favoring the rich. Right now we're in the midst of one of the greatest threats to small businesses our country has ever seen. What's Donald Trump doing about it? He's giving big banks the green light to loan millions of dollars. MCKELWAY: That comment omitted the lowest black unemployment rate in history before the virus hit. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I support him 100 percent. MCKELWAY: The Biden campaign also held separate events with Native Americans, another with African-American Virginia Congressman Bobby Scott, and a virtual meeting with President Obama and George Clooney. (END VIDEOTAPE) MCKELWAY: The virus is defining two very different agendas when it comes to rebuilding the economy. Biden is based upon an expansion of government aid and regulations. Trump's is based upon freeing up businesses from such regulations. Shannon? BREAM: Doug McKelway in Delaware. Thank you, Doug. Now for an examination of what then candidate Donald Trump promised in 2016 and how that's turned out. Correspondent Kristin Fisher takes a look from the White House today. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KRISTIN FISHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Before the pandemic put a stop to the president's rallies, he often delivered remarks in between banners that read \"Promises Made\" and \"Promises Kept.\" Without question, the most successful and perhaps consequential promise that he kept from the 2016 campaign has been to fill the judiciary with conservatives. DONALD TRUMP, (R) PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: The justices that I'm going to appoint will be pro-life. They will have a conservative bent. FISHER: In addition to Supreme Court justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, the Senate has confirmed 198 other judicial appointments, a record for a first term president. Another promise kept, renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement and replacing it with the USMCA. TRUMP: Today we're finally ending the NAFTA nightmare. FISHER: But the president struggled to secure a trade deal with China. He also didn't secure quite as many tax cuts as he promised, but he came close with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. And then there is his signature campaign issue from 2016. TRUMP: We will build that great wall, and Mexico will pay for that great wall. FISHER: Last month the president celebrated the completion of 200 miles of border wall, but Mexico did not pay for it. TRUMP: We're going to rebuild our infrastructure. FISHER: But three-and-a-half years in, the president has yet to put forward an infrastructure plan, though the White House says he may announce one soon. Another promise broken, repealing the Affordable Care Act. TRUMP: We will do it, and we will do it very, very quickly. (END VIDEOTAPE) FISHER: But President Trump is still trying to keep that promise. Just last month his administration asked the Supreme Court to overturn Obamacare, but the justices have decided that they will not hear those arguments until after the election. Shannon? BREAM: Kristin Fisher from the White House, thank you. The attorney for the Kentucky high school student who was involved in a confrontation with a Native American in Washington last year says CNN's chief media correspondent breached his company's settlement agreement with the teenager. Attorney Lin Wood says a retweet from Brian Stelter about how much money Nicholas Sandmann may have been awarded from \"The Washington Post\" in a settlement of that lawsuit may cost him his job. CNN is not commenting. Attorney General William Barr gets into it with Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee about a number of issues. Reaction from the panel when we come back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. HAKEEM JEFFRIES, (D-NY) HOUSE BUDGET COMMITTEE: The job of the White House Counsel is to be the president's lawyer. The job of the attorney general is to be the people's lawyer. And it's not clear that William Barr understands that distinction. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: In your office, you are then free to act independently of the president. Isn't that true? WILLIAM BARR, U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL: That is true. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And that's exactly what he has asked you to do, isn't that right? BARR: Yes. REP. JIM JORDAN, (R-OH) HOUSE OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE: The attorney general is enforcing the rule of law. And if the Democrats want to blame the attorney general for what is happening in Democrat-run cities that have been Democrat-run for years and years, I think the last time there was an elected Republican in Portland was 1956 -- if they want to blame the administration for that, they're just flat out wrong. (END VIDEO CLIP) BREAM: Let's bring in our panel, Byron York, chief political correspondent for the \"Washington Examiner,\" Mara Liasson, national political correspondent for National Public Radio, and \"Washington Post\" columnist Marc Thiessen. Great to see all of you. I trust that you had a chance to watch a good chunk of these hearings today, so I want to get an initial reaction from you. Let's start with you, Marc. MARC THIESSEN, AMERICAN ENTERPRISE INSTITUTE: It was a disgrace. First of all, the American people learned a new phrase, which is \"I'm reclaiming my time,\" which is government for please shut up. I'm going to try that with my kids one day because it's a nicer way to say it, I guess. It was a disgrace. What the American people saw was Democrats relentlessly attacking the character and the credibility of the attorney general while he sat there and tried to answer, and they would cut him off and stop him from answering. You quoted one of the congressmen saying he doesn't -- questioning his credibility. How would he know? He didn't let him answer a question. They didn't even give him a lunch break. It was just awful. But the truth is that we did learn some things, and it was useful for him to sit through that because the chairman of that committee said just the other day that what's happening in Portland is at mid spread in Washington, and at a bare minimum the American people saw a video of what was happening in Portland actually happening, and they saw the attorney general describing how they're using sling shots with ball bearings that have injured officers to the bone, using kerosene filled balloons to set fires to draw them outside so that they can attack them. This is an outrage, and the American people need to see and hear from their government what's happening. BREAM: And Mara, the chairman of the committee, we talked about earlier, Jerry Nadler, he said that this is all happening, this federal action and activity in places like Portland federal courthouse -- he says that it is all sort of a smoke screen so the images will be out there. Here is a bit of his exchange back and forth with the attorney general on the topic. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. JERROLD NADLER, (D-NY) HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN: The president wants footage for his campaign ads, and you appear to be serving it up to him as ordered. The protesters aren't mobs. They are mothers and veterans and mayors. WILLIAM BARR, U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL: Federal courts are under attack. Since when is it OK to try to burn down a federal court? Is that OK now? No. The U.S. Marshals have a duty to stop that and defend the courthouse, and that's what we are doing in Portland. We're not out looking for trouble. (END VIDEO CLIP) BREAM: Mara, there certainly are some mothers and some veterans and some mayors out there, but, Mara, there are people who, you could say, hijacking the underlying peaceful protests and turning them into something much different at the end of each night, especially now 60 plus nights in Portland. MARA LIASSON, NATIONAL POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, NATIONAL PUBLIC RADIO: \u00a0Right. And the Democrats' argument is that but for the extra federal presence, police presence in Portland, the peaceful demonstrations would not have escalated, and that the feds are kind of inciting some of this violence by being there. From the point of view of Barr, and I thought he laid out his case extremely forcefully, is that a federal building is under attack. So you've got this extremely polarized view. It's the same thing with the view of the Justice Department itself. From the Democrats' point of view Barr is doing favors for Trump and Trump's friends. From Barr's point of view the Justice Department became weaponized against Donald Trump. So I would say this was kind of Washington at its most polarized. BREAM: Yes, I think people on both sides ended up very frustrated. Towards the end the attorney general just chuckling and throwing up his hands, Byron. He at one point realized this whole \"I reclaim my time\" means you're not going to answer the question. But we heard something today, too, that we've heard a lot about in recent weeks, that if President Trump is not reelected he may not leave the White House, that all these federal agents on the street are a test run, a trial run for martial law so that he can swoop in and hang on to control of the White House. Here is a little bit more of the conversation today about the 2020 election and what role the attorney general would play if it got ugly. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. CEDRIC RICHMOND, (D-LA) HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE: As attorney general attorney general of the United States do you believe that this 2020 presidential election will be rigged? WILLIAM BARR, U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL: I have no reason to think it will be. RICHMOND Do you believe as the attorney general of the United States that mail-in voting will lead to massive voter fraud? BARR: I think there is a high risk that it will. (END VIDEO CLIP) BREAM: Byron, what do you make about this ongoing theme, this thread that we're hearing played out over the last couple of weeks and today as well about the 2020 election and the president being unable to let go or refuse to leave if he doesn't win? BRYON YORK, CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, \"WASHINGTON EXAMINER\": This has been a Democratic talking point in recent days. It was a Democratic talking point in 2016, by the way, when Donald Trump was a private citizen running for president, there was talk about him somehow not accepting the results had he lost. But he won. But we're hearing a lot about this. And the issue is that the parties seem to have just divided over this issue of voting by mail, and Attorney General Barr was really pretty skeptical about that and believed that it does have the potential for fraud. And also a bigger thing -- even if there were absolutely zero fraud, we've got a few congressional elections in New York that are still undecided because they have been having massive problems with counting and seeing which mail-in ballots are legitimate. This is an enormous problem, and these are in congressional districts in New York state. Put that in a national context, in a presidential election where there's far, far more voting by mail than there ever has been before, and there could be enormous problems. We might not find out who actually won for weeks afterwards. Meanwhile, there is just terrible partisan wrangling going on ala Bush v Gore. So there are some really bad scenarios for voting by mail, and the attorney general simply recognized some of those. BREAM: When you say weeks, Byron, I think we all might have to stock up on the antacids if it comes to that. But we'll all be in it together as we cover it and it falls out. Panel, thank you. Stick around. President Trump next up takes on Dr. Fauci and gets defensive over the coronavirus. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES: \u00a0I don't tweet. I don't even read them, so I don't really want to go there. I just will continue to do my job no matter what comes out because I think it's very important. I have not been misleading the American public under any circumstances. DONALD TRUMP, (R) PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: He's working with our administration, and for the most part we've done pretty much what he and others, Dr. Birx and others, who are terrific, recommended. He's got this high approval ratings. They're highly thought of, but nobody likes me. It can only be my personality. That's all. (END VIDEO CLIP) BREAM: Well, a little bit of levity from the president there today. We're back with our panel, and Mara, I want to start with you. There has been so much about trying to pit Dr. Fauci against President Trump, and yet when confronted face-to-face they each will say we get along fine. We discuss things. We meet. Everything is great. I think so much of him and it's wonderful. And yet there is this constant attempt at driving a wedge between the two. What do you make of it? LIASSON: Yes, I think that it's in neither of their interests to have a wedge driven between the two of them. Dr. Fauci is the good housekeeping seal of approval on this pandemic, and he has been all along. There have been times when the president was more interested in opening the economy, that he wasn't meeting with Fauci enough, as much as he had been, or he wasn't having him to the briefings. But what I don't understand, and it's mystifying to me, is why does President Trump continue to retweet disparaging comments about Dr. Fauci? That I just don't understand. I don't think it's in his interests to undermine the credibility of Dr. Fauci. BREAM: They seem to have a very complex relationship, those two. Meanwhile, they're talking about, on Capitol Hill, putting together more relief funding. There's a fight over these plus-up for unemployment benefits. Today the two sides don't seem much closer together. Byron, here is what former senator Phil Gramm, who is known for crunching the numbers, here is what he had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. PHIL GRAMM, (R-TX) FORMER SENATE BANKING COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN: We've spent a massive amount of money, and the bill has yet to really come due. I believe that we would be blessed if we didn't see another bill pass here and we simply went back and reprogrammed some of the $1.2 trillion. (END VIDEO CLIP) BREAM: OK, Byron, so no bill better than another big deal, what do you think? YORK: Well, that's Phil Gramm's view, and certainly people who need more unemployment aid would certainly disagree with that. On the other hand, when the two sides are trillions of dollars apart, that's a real problem. And Republicans are not united on this. I want to say one thing, though, about this news conference. The president did announce, began by announcing a $765 million loan to Kodak, the photography company, to start making pharmaceuticals, actually the building blocks of generic drugs, in part to address our scandalous reliance on China. I think in the last year or two, because of the trade negotiations people learned how dependent the United States is on China for pharmaceuticals -- 97 percent of our antibiotics come from China. And so any move to try to improve that, and the president started his news conference off by announcing that, would be a good thing. BREAM: The president was pressed today, too, on what his plans are for the RNC, what he'll do, where he is going to deliver his acceptance speech. He used one of these conferences last week to say that it wasn't going to play out the way we've seen conventions play out in the past with the big events in Florida. And now tonight we are just getting word that there are more than 100 police agencies who say they are not going to enter into or live up to these agreements with the DNC because they have now been told the local directives there are that they cannot use pepper spray or teargas or other crowd control things that they've used in the past. So now more than 100 of these police agencies saying they're not going to send agents in or officers in to assist with this. They don't think they can do so safely. Marc? THIESSEN: They might as well move it to Chicago and repeat 1968. Exactly, this is what happens when you defund the police. The police don't come. And so I'm not surprised that police agencies are upset and are saying they're not going to support the conventions. We don't know how these conventions are going to play out, still. We don't know what Trump is going to do because we don't how the pandemic is doing. And when he announced that he was going to move it to Jacksonville, Florida looked like it was doing great. Then all of a sudden Florida wasn't doing so great. So he was smart today to keep his powder dry and say we'll let you know soon what the plan is for my convention speech. BREAM: Mara, do you think the DNC can proceed if they've lost 100 plus law enforcement agencies who were planning to help them manage it? We have all been to conventions, you know, even though these are probably going to be scaled down, it is a logistical and security -- very tight puzzle that's got to work exactly right because of all the people that are there, and high profile, to protect. LIASSON: What I'm really unclear on is how many high-profile people will be there. The DNC has been scaling back, scaling back, a couple hundred people, we know that Joe Biden was planning to accept the nomination in Milwaukee. But I'm wondering what are the protesters going to be protesting if this thing is almost completely virtual? So that is unclear to me. But the fact that these conventions are supposed to start on August 17th for the Democrats and August 24th for the Republicans, that's not very far away. And they still don't know exactly what they're going to be like. THIESSEN: There's only a few hundred people at the courthouse in Portland. BREAM: All right, last 15 second to you, Byron. Yes, that's true. Byron? YORK: My favorite moment of the news -- yes. President Trump today is asked you're going to accept the nomination on Thursday night of the convention week. Where are you physically going to be? And he says we'll be announcing that soon. Anybody have any ideas? That's the way it's going. BREAM: That is what he said. We're standing by for all of that and more. Panel, stick around. When we come back, technical difficulties on Capitol Hill. You'll feel the pain. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BREAM: A gloomy night here in Washington, D.C., we want to take you live now to just outside the U.S. Capitol Hill where Congressman and Civil Rights icon John Lewis continues to lie in state where folks can come by and the lines have continued all day to pay their respects, and to remember him, the one who called for a good trouble to shake things up and to change our country, to force us to have tough conversations and make things better. That continues tonight here in Washington. His funeral will be on Thursday. Finally tonight, confusion on Capitol Hill. During a virtual Senate committee hearing on coronavirus relief, Republicans and Democrats finally found some common ground, but might not be what you'd expect. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: With that, Senator Romney. Is Senator Romney there? Why don't we go to Senator Hassan if she's available? Senator Carper? I'll just go down the list here. I don't see Senator Hassan. We'll go to Senator Carper? Here's Senator Romney. Senator Romney, are you ready to go? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I want to thank Senator Romney and Senator Hassan for yielding their time to me. I now have 21 minutes. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I come through here. Can you hear me all right? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Who have we got on? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Senator Romney, go ahead. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: OK, the hell with it. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No, no, Senator Romney. Romney? (END VIDEO CLIP) BREAM: OK. Everyone who has been doing virtual meetings, as you are trapped at home, we've all had that experience so - even Senators have it, too.

I'm Jesse Watters, along with Juan Williams, Greg Gutfeld, Dagen McDowell, and Emily Compagno. It is 5:00 in New York City, and this is THE FIVE. Fox News Alert, you're looking live at the White House podium, where any minute now, President Trump will be holding his first Coronavirus briefing since April. It could be a boost to his re-election campaign, as cases of the virus continue to spike in the U.S. The president is expected to focus on vaccines and therapeutics, and is planning on taking questions from the press, Democrats not happy with the return of the briefings. They are furious at the president is talking directly to the American people. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Donald Trump demonstrates every single day not just that he's incompetent. It's also that he is dangerous. And people are dying because of this pandemic. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Do you hear that, Donald Trump? You have created one of the greatest failures in presidential leadership in our country's entire history. When the White House Coronavirus briefings resume, President Trump should not take the podium. Every time President Trump takes the podium at one of these briefings, he's a threat to public health. (END VIDEO CLIP) WATTERS: OK. Emily, I'm always under the assumption when Chuck Schumer says the president shouldn't do something, he should do it. EMILY COMPAGNO, FOX NEWS HOST: I am of that same ilk. I will say that I'm a full supporter of the return of these briefings. And I think it's a great way for the president to win back those voters that he might've lost to a potentially lost confidence in his handling of the pandemic, and also to turn around the narrative being pushed by Chuck Schumer and those on the left that his handling has been a failure. But for this to work, he, in my opinion, needs to do three things. He needs to be realistic. He needs to not oversell a vaccine or any timelines. He also needs to be prudent and talk about the importance of social distancing and mask-wearing. And he also needs to highlight the successes, right? For example, sports are slowly returning because they are taking it seriously. And I think the more that he sort of sticks to those data points, the more he comes full forth as a leader, the more that this will bode well for him and also potential voters. WATTERS: I think those are three great things. And I will go to Juan Williams on one more thing. I think there was one or two moments in the briefings a few months ago where one of the news reporters asked just a horrific question, just a total set up. You know, how much blood are you willing to spill, Mr. President, you know, that kind of thing. And he handled it really well. He kind of rose above the animosity of the question, didn't take the bait, and spoke kind of above her to the American people about how he cared and how compassionate he was. I think if he can do that again, in a less confrontational way, the American people will continue to tune in and get their information from these briefings, Juan. JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS HOST: Yeah. I mean, I think that's good advice. I liked Emily's advice. I liked your advice, Jesse. I mean, to me, the key here is that Coronavirus is the number one point of concern for Americans today. I don't think there's any question about it. It's a bigger issue than the economy. And voters clearly don't think that the president is doing a good job, not with 138,000 people dead. Not with the economy still struggling with this virus. So you know what's interesting is the politics, because their opinions of the president's handling of the virus is very closely aligned with their choice for president in the presidential race. And right now, Joe Biden is up, I think, it's plus 17 in the Fox poll. Sixty percent of Americans in the Washington Post poll say they disapprove of the way President Trump has been dealing with the virus. Now, until recently, the White House said he was too busy to attend the Coronavirus task force meetings. I guess that's changing. And I -- that's why I think your advice -- Emily's advice is good. If he can come in with data, real information, as opposed to making this a new source of rallies or a substitute for the convention or just for, you know, berating reporters, I think that it would be great for the American people. WATTERS: Dagen, you know what strikes me about that poll number about approval on the virus handling? As if Joe Biden were president, we probably would've had three times as many dead because he was against the ban from China. So I don't really understand that poll result, do you? DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX NEWS HOST: No. And I would like to see the likes of, say, Governor Cuomo or THE FIVE governors that sent COVID positive patients back into nursing homes. In this count -- 45 governors didn't -- I'd like to see how they poll with Governor Cuomo and his vomitus portrait of denial that he had a hand in literally killing thousands of elderly people just in New York State. But I am irritated and bothered by the kind of lethal posture of some of these Democrats. Have they no shame? Because they are willingly standing atop the suffering and hardship of the American people for a higher political profile, and more -- more love from the chattering classes. We need, as a nation, to admit that people in government, they have no idea what they're doing. Every American is going to have to take responsibility for protecting themselves and their families and even their elderly loved ones. Because certainly, these Democrats didn't do it in places like New York. And I know President Trump. One thing he's going to do is go through the long list of private companies that are creating vaccines and what the timeline looks like. And if you start with AstraZeneca, Moderna, Pfizer, Merck, and Johnson and Johnson, they are on it. And hopefully, we'll have something by early next year. WATTERS: Yeah. Greg, it seems the Democrats saying everything -- I would've done everything Donald Trump did except I would've done it earlier, better, and faster. It's pretty easy to say. GREG GUTFELD, FOX NEWS HOST: Yeah. I mean, I said it yesterday. I'm still waiting for what alternative suggestions they have that counters Trump. All they do is they look at what he does and say, oh, I could've done it better. But none of them, none of them offered any real -- I don't know, suggestions early on. You know, we just -- we shovelled a bunch of Democratic narratives in the front of this show. And we have to hit that with the data and the real info, as Juan mentions. Let us not forget that it's New York and New Jersey, Connecticut, Massachusetts that have the worst death rates. These are Democratic-led states. Right now, New Jersey, New York, and Connecticut, they are one- third of the death rates, six percent of the population. These are Democratic-run, Democrat-led. Through yesterday, two and a half times more deaths are occurring in Democratic states than in Republican states. So when you have this narrative pushed by the media and then they poll the narrative, right, they push this narrative that Republicans, and by connection Trump, are responsible for badness. And then they poll it and they go surprise. People are dissatisfied with it. It's because you are running this false narrative. The fact -- I mean, the fact is Trump accomplished and America accomplished three things. We set out to flatten the curve, and we did. Then when we flattened, which helped the hospitals, we decided we'd get back to work in phases. No one disagreed with any of this. And so we went back to in phases, and we knew if there was going to a problem that we would make adjustments while trying to find treatments, which we've been doing. Remember, it was the media that blasted the treatments like Hydroxychloroquine, and actually took pleasure in flawed studies that said it didn't work. So the one thing we learned about COVID is that the only entity that made it worse is the media. And what Trump is trying to do is speak directly to the American people. And right, now he's more important than the experts who've been proven wrong on so many things, from masks, to a social distancing, to the shutdown. So remember, there are people saying do not change your life. As far back as February and March, do not change your life. Live your life the same. And then all of a sudden, Trump listened and absorbed the information, and then made the right decisions. Americans fell in line. They'd made great sacrifices. Now, we are trying to get our economy back together. And by the way, it is bouncing back. But it's not going to be easy. We know that. We understand that. We are adults. We can balance risk with benefit and risk with progress. We don't need to be lectured every day about how many people are dying when you aren't telling us the death rates, right? When you just sit there and tell us how many more cases there, but you don't talk about whether the death rates are declining. We know what they're up to. We know what the narrative is, and it's all baloney. WATTERS: Yeah. Emily, to Greg's point, I wonder if the way the media has levelled these expectations against the president, if he had been a Democrat, maybe this would have been perceived as a humongous success that he had prevented the spread of more virus coming in from China with the travel ban, and then take an early action to shutdown the greatest economy in the world. And then opened it back up based on the science, and is now encouraging your sons and daughters to get back safely into school. This could have been totally covered differently, and if, you know, if Barack Obama or Joe Biden had been Commander-in-Chief. I wonder if a lot of the perceptions have been so polluted by the 100 percent negative coverage of everything the administration did. That's got to have been infecting a lot of the people's minds about how safe or successful they feel. COMPAGNO: Oh, undoubtedly, Jesse, 100 percent. That's exactly what has happened. And I have to say, too that that's part of what's dangerous, because given that this is a public health crisis, people don't believe what they don't want to believe. So as you say, if they're inundated with pre-perception or they're carved into who they believe that they should follow. Well, then, nothing will change their mind. No amount of data, no amount of facts. And that is the saddest part. However, with the president resuming these briefings and sticking to data, and everything that Greg just outlined, if he says that every day, day after day, first of all, the narrative and the messaging is back in his court. And secondly, it rebuts everything day after day. (CROSSTALK) DONALD TRUMP, UNITED STATES PRESIDENT: Today, I want to provide an update on our response to the China virus and what my administration is doing to get the outbreak in the Sun Belt under control, seems largely in Sun Belt that it could be spreading. My team is also working night and day with Capitol Hill to advance the next economic relief package. We are working very hard on it. We are making a lot of progress. I also know that both sides want to get it done. We will call it Phase Four. I think we are going to get it done. We will protect our workers, our schools, and our families, and protect them very strongly. As one family, we mourn every precious life that's been lost. I pledge in their honor that we will develop a vaccine, and we will defeat the virus. We are doing very well with vaccine development and therapeutic development. But I want to thank our brave doctors and nurses and frontline responders. The job they do is incredible, and they are truly brave. My administration will stop at nothing to save lives, shield the vulnerable, which is so important. We have learned so much about this disease. And we know who the vulnerable are. And we are going to indeed shield them. And again, the vaccines are coming, and they are coming a lot sooner than anyone thought possible by years. You look at the old system and look at the new system, I think by years. The China virus is a vicious and dangerous illness, but we've learned a great deal about it and who it targets. And we are in the process of developing a strategy that's going to be very, very powerful. We have developed it as we go along. Some areas of our country are doing very well. Others are doing less well. It will probably, unfortunately, get worse before it gets better. Something I don't like saying about things, but that's the way it is. It's what we have. You look over the world. It's all over the world. And it tends to do that. The governors are working very, very hard. And we are supporting them 100 percent. Everything they need, they get. And we are taking good care. We have tremendous supplies and a great supply chain, whether it's ventilators or gowns or just about anything they need. So that's a big difference from inheriting very, very empty cupboards. The median age of those who succumb to the China virus is 78 years old. Roughly, half of all deaths have been individuals in nursing homes or long- term care. In one study, 90 percent of those hospitalized had underlying medical conditions, whether it's heart or diabetes. But usually, it's some kind of a condition it seems that people have that. And if they do, it's a problem, no question about it. Young adults may often have mild or even no symptoms. They won't even know they're sick. They won't have any idea that they have a virus. They won't have any idea at all. America's youth will act responsibly. And we are asking everybody that when you are not able to socially distance, wear a mask. Get a mask, whether you like the mask or not, they have an impact. They will have an effect. And we need everything we can get. Data shows children have the lowest fatality risk, 99.96 percent of all virus fatalities are in adults. Think of that. So that's much, much, much less than one percent for children, young people. By understanding these risks, profiles, and learning how to treat the disease, we've been able to greatly reduce mortality in the United States. In fact, we will show you a chart and how well we do compared to the rest of the world. We have several treatments already available that significantly reduce the severity and duration of the disease, including Remdesivir, which has been very successful and a widely available steroid treatment. And we have many more happening in coming out. We've learned best practices for treatment of the virus at every stage and have shared these findings with medical providers. And we have shared them all over the world. And the relationship with other countries has been very strong. We are all working together. This includes ensuring all hospitals are aware of the importance of different approaches to oxygen treatment. Including high flow oxygen, the importance of steroid treatment for those on ventilators, and when you're on a ventilator, we have learned a tremendous amount about the use of the ventilator. And at the beginning, people never had an experience like this where we needed so many ventilators so fast, and even the use of the ventilators. But the doctors have become incredibly -- and nurses and helpers have become incredibly good at the use of a ventilator, which is actually a very complicated procedure. And allocating Remdesivir to hospitals based on admissions since it works based early in hospitalization. And that's something that they have really started. They are using it much earlier. Fatalities nationwide have fallen 75 percent since mid-April. It's a great number. As cases and fatalities rise in certain hard-hit states, which you're looking at right now. We are surging personnel, supplies, and therapeutics. We, again, have tremendous amounts of supplies. We are in very good shape, and we can move them quickly. Our case fatality rate has continued to decline and is lower than the European Union and almost everywhere else in the world. If you watch American television, you would think that the United States was the only country involved with and suffering from the China virus. Well, the world is suffering very badly. But the fact is that many countries are suffering very, very, very badly. And they've been suffering from this virus for a long time. We have done much better than most. And with the fatality rate at a lower rate than most, it's something that we can talk about. But we are working again with them, because we are helping a lot of countries that people don't even know about. I get calls all the time asking for help, especially as it pertains to the ventilators. They need help with ventilators. They have to get them. They are very hard to get. We are making thousands now a month, thousands of ventilators a month. It's been quite amazing. We keep doing a good job. And things will get better and better. We will be putting up charts behind me, showing different statistics and different rates of success. And I guess you could say also things that we can do better on, but you'll see them. They will be put up as we go. In April, the average age of individuals who tested positive for the virus was over 50 years old. Today, the average age is significantly younger. Hospital lengths of stay are almost half of what they were in April. So the stays are about half. The rate of cases requiring hospitalization has been reduced. And mortality among those admitted to the hospital is nearly one half of what it was in April. We have learned a lot. We have learned a lot about this disease, how to handle it. The doctors have learned a lot, not only in the use of the ventilators but in many other things. And things are happening, too, like the Remdesivir and other elements, steroids et cetera. But these trends could change without our continued and relentless focus. And that's what we have. We have a relentless focus. And it's been that way from the beginning. But we have learned so much. As you know, in recent weeks, we have seen a concerning rise in the cases in many parts of our south. You look at south, southwest, and west. This growth in cases first began to appear in mid-June, primarily among 18 to 35-year-olds, many of whom were asymptomatic. We are also facing the challenge of a significant spike in virus cases across the rest of the western hemisphere, including Mexico. Mexico has been hit very, very, very hard. As you know, the president, a great gentleman, was here two weeks ago. And they have really been hit hard. Because we've achieved a nearly fourfold increase in testing capacity in two months, we are successfully identifying more asymptomatic and mild cases, some cases so mild that you really don't even treat them, some cases with children where they don't even know that they are ill. And I guess there are not very ill because they recover almost immediately. Per capita, the U.S. is conducting 50 percent more test than Europe. And we have conducted nearly three times as many tests as all of the other countries in the western hemisphere combined. It would be over 50 million tests. This allows us to isolate those who are infected, even those without symptoms so we know exactly where it's going and when it's going to be there. We are also working to reduce turn around time. My administration has been aggressively responding to case growth in the Sun Belt and we continue to do so, working very close with all governors. But right now, in particular, those governors. We are coordinating closely with hospitals and governors in the last three weeks. I have sent senior officials into nine states to meet with governors and provide recommendations to the various leaders of the state, including hospital administrators, et cetera. My administration currently has zero unfilled requests for -- unfulfilled requests for equipment or anything else that they need from the governors. No governor needs anything right now. And we think we will have it that way until the end, because frankly, we are stocked up and ready to go wherever we have to go. We have nearly 7,000 National Guard and military medical personnel in Texas, California, Florida, and Arizona that's helping us greatly. I want to thank them very much. The military has been fantastic. We are closely monitoring hospital capacity in the states. Hospitals are open for elective surgeries and other procedures. So hospitals are open for elective surgeries. We want Americans to get the medical treatments they need. All of the governors, we have spoken with say they have enough bed capacity. That's a great thing. Our initial shutdown was to prevent the overflow of our hospitals and to allow us to meet the demands caused by this global pandemic, including the ventilators. And a permanent shutdown was really never an option in terms of what we're doing right now. This would be completely unsustainable. Produce debilitating economic fallback and lead to catastrophic public health consequences. There are consequences to shutdowns. And we have saved potentially millions of lives by doing the initial shutdown. But now, we are very aware of this disease. We understand the disease to a large extent. Nobody is going to maybe ever really fully understand it, but we will end up with a cure. We will end up with therapeutics. We'll up with a vaccine very soon, all three. We are instead asking Americans to use masks, socially distance, and employ vigorous hygiene. Wash your hands every chance you get while sheltering high risk populations. We are imploring young Americans to avoid packed bars and other crowded indoor gatherings. Be safe and be smart. We are surging testing capacity to identify and isolate cases. This includes a newly improved testing platform to nursing homes across the south. We're being very, very vigilant with respect to nursing homes. Because, you know all of the problems that we've had with so many people so sadly -- they were infected. So that all of the staff and residents can be routinely tested and isolated to ensure our elderly are even more strongly protected than anybody else. That's really the high risk people, the high risk wonderful people. Once this current surging cases decline, the same testing platform will enable people to visit their loved ones after taking a test, which is a big difference. Ultimately, our goal is not merely to manage the pandemic but to end it. We want to get rid of it as soon as we can. That is why getting a vaccine will remains a top priority. Two vaccine candidates are entering the final stage of clinical trials this month. This was achieved in record time. It used to be years before you were in a position like we are right now. Four other vaccines will enter final trials in the following weeks. And we are mass producing all of the top candidates, so that the first approved vaccine will be available immediately. And logistically, we have the military ready to go. We have great people, logistic military people, a wonderful general who is waiting for the vaccine so they can distribute it in record time. That's what's going to happen. So our military is all set to go. We will deliver a vaccine, therapeutics, whatever it is as necessary and defeat the virus once and for all. And I'll take a few questions, if you'd like. I will say this. I want to thank all of the staff, the White House staff, and all of the doctors that we've been working with so closely. And just a lot a very positive things are happening. It's a nasty, horrible disease that should've never been allowed to escape China, but it did. And it infected the world, and the world of suffering. But we are going to get it taken care of, and we are helping lots of other countries. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Mr. President, first, I just wanted to get clarification. Your press secretary said today that you sometimes take more than one test a day. Why is that? TRUMP: Well, I didn't know about more than one. I do take probably on average a test every two days, three days. And I don't know of any time I've taken two tests in one day, but I could see that happening. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: So Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill had said they want to see more money for testing. They want to send billions of dollars to the states so they can do more testing. And you probably saw Mick Mulvaney the other day said that his kid, it took him a week to get test results back. He said this is simply inexcusable, given where we are in the pandemic. Do you think we have a problem with testing in this country right now? Are you in favor of more money for testing? TRUMP: We've done more testing by far than anybody. Some of the test, because it is a massive volume, it takes longer. Others are very quick, they're five minutes, they're 15 minute tests. Those are frankly the ones that I prefer. But we are doing massive numbers. And the numbers are coming down. And as we go, as an example, there are thousands and thousands of kits being made right now, which give you a 15 minute and a five-minute test. So we will be able to get those numbers down. Those numbers are similar in other places. They are also doing massive numbers, numbers like nobody thought possible. But those numbers will be coming down. I agree. I think it's a good thing that we can do it. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Are you in favor of more money for testing? TRUMP: Well, they are going to make a presentation to me tonight and tomorrow on that. And again, we're leading the world. I think we are the second country. We will be over 50 million tests. The second country is India with 12 million. And then you have 7 million, 6 million, and 4 million. I think that we are doing tremendous amount of testing. But if the doctors and the professionals feel that, even though we are at a level that nobody ever dreamt possible that they would like to do more, I'm OK with it. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Why are your doctors not with you here today? Where's Dr. Fauci, Dr. Birx? TRUMP: Well, Dr. Birx is right outside -- yes, please. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I just wanted to know, in November, do you want to the American people to judge you on the ballot in November by how you handled this pandemic so far? TRUMP: This among other things. I think the American people will judge us on this, but they'll judge us on the economy that I created and that already we are creating. We're setting record job numbers, as you know. I think we're going to have a very strong year next year. I think were going to have a very strong third quarter, a very good fourth quarter. But I think next year's going to be a record year. And I think they're going to judge me on that. I think they're going to judge me on the tax- cutting and deregulation cutting, which nobody's ever done to the extent that we've been able to do it. On rebuilding the military, on how we've handled the VA, on the VA. We got veterans choice. Nobody thought that would be possible. That's been many decades. They've been trying to get veterans choice. It's called choice, where they can go get a doctor, if they have to wait online for two weeks or five weeks or two days. And frankly, that's been a great thing. Veteran's accountability, I think they'll judge me on that. They'll judge me on all of the things we've done. I don't think -- and I think we can say this with surety, and it's never been challenged in three and a half years, the first three and a half years. The first years of a presidency, I don't think any administration, any president has accomplished so much as we've accomplished, from energy, to health, to so many other things. And then this came in, the plague -- I call it the plague. The plague came in. Terrible thing, should've been stopped, wasn't stopped. It came in. We had to shut things down to save potentially millions of lives. We did that. And now, we've started them up. And I think we've really started it up very successfully. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Thank you, Mr. President. You've been saying for months the virus would simply disappear. And now, you're saying that it's likely to get worse before it gets better. If it does keep getting worse, if Americans keep dying, are you responsible for that? TRUMP: Well, the virus will disappear. It will disappear. I think that -- I always like to say, you know, either way, when you look at it, the governors are working with me. I am working with the governors. We are working hand-in-hand. I think we are all responsible. I view it as a team, very good relationships with the governors, very, very good relationships. I could say I'm fully responsible. But, you know, one day we had a virus come in and I close the borders, did a lot of things that were very good. In fact, Dr. Fauci said we saved tens of thousands of lives when I closed the border. Nobody wanted to do it. I wanted to do it. We closed the border to China. We put on the ban. We didn't want people coming in from heavily- infected China. Fairly shortly thereafter, I close the borders from Europe, coming in from Europe. Those were tremendous moves. We would have -- one person is too much, but we're let's say 140,000. We could have double, triple quadruple that number if we didn't. So, we did a lot of things right. We did a lot of things right, including with equipment. So it's a shame that it happened. It shouldn't have happened. China should have stopped it. (CROSSTALK) TRUMP: Yes, go ahead, please. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Thank you, President Trump. If I could, two question questions. My first question is, we have a very quick testing platform here at the White House. TRUMP: Yes. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's great. You get tested, you know, very quickly. Do you think that it would be easier to reopen and restart businesses if we could produce more of this machine? TRUMP: We're trying to do that? Great question. We're trying very much to do that. So rather than sending your tests in and you know, goes through the mail, one day comes back another day, no matter how they send them, it's a day and a day, so that's two days already wasted. And then if it spends -- by the time you get it back, it's three or four days if they do an efficient job. We're trying to get the testing on-site. I like it the best. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Thank you. And my follow up -- my second question is a little bit different topic, but it's one that a lot of people are talking about. Ghislaine Maxwell is in prison, and so a lot of people want to know if she's going to turn in powerful people. And I know you've talked in the past about Prince Andrew, and you criticize Bill Clinton's behavior. I'm wondering, do you feel that she's going to turn in powerful men. How do you see that working out? TRUMP: I don't know. I haven't really been following it too much. I just wish her well frankly. I've met her numerous times over the years, especially since I lived in Palm Beach and I guess they lived in Palm Beach. But I wish her well, whatever it is. I don't know the situation with Prince Andrew. I just don't know. I'm not aware of it. (CROSSTALK) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: On unemployment insurance, how much below $600 are you willing to go? And you've said that the economy has gotten back strong, so why do we need to even cut it at all? TRUMP: Well, the economy is getting stronger, and I think we have a chance to have a very strong economy, especially some of the things that I just spoke about were. We want to have people go back and want to go back to work as opposed to be sort of forced into a position where they're making more money than they expected to make, and the employees are having a hard time getting back to work. So that was a decision that was made. I was against that original decision, but they did that. It still worked out well, because it gave people a lifeline, a real lifeline. Now, we're doing it again. They're thinking about doing 70 percent of the amount. The amount would be the same but doing it in a little bit smaller initial amounts, so that people are going to want to go back to work as opposed to making so much money that they really don't have to. But we were very generous with him. I think that it's been a tremendously successful program. The whole thing has been successful if you look. I mean, we have -- we're in a pandemic and yet we're producing tremendous number of jobs. That was something that nobody thought possible, OK. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Mr. President, thank you very much. Yesterday you said that wearing a mask was an act of patriotism. If that is the case, why don't you do it more frequently? TRUMP: Well, I do actually do it when I need it. I mean, carry the mask when I have to go -- I went into Walter Reed Hospital the other day. I have the mask right here. I carry it and I will use it gladly. No problem with it. And I've said that. And I say, if you can, use the mask. When you can, use the mask. If you're close to each other, if you're in a group, I would put it on. When I'm in a group, if I'm in an elevator, and there are other people with me, including like security people, it's not their fault. They have to be in the elevator. I want to protect them also. I put on a mask. I will have -- I have no problem with the masks. I view it this way. Anything that potentially can help, and that certainly can potentially help, is a good thing. I have no problem. I carry it, I wear it. You saw me wearing it a number of times, and I'll continue. Please. (CROSSTALK) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Are you sending mixed messages though? Yesterday, you tweeted out an image wearing a mask, and then last evening, we saw you not wearing a mask at your hotel? TRUMP: Well, I don't know. The hotel, I was pretty far away from people. But I would say this. I've explained it, I think very well. If you're close together, I would put on the mask. And if you're not, I would say that if you're -- for instance, I'll see -- like here, you've been tested, I've been tested. Oftentimes, I'll be with people that are fully tested. I've been tested. In theory, you don't need the mask. I'm getting used to the mask. And the reason is, I think about patriotism. Maybe it is -- it helps, it helps. Now, we have experts that have said in the recent past that masks aren't necessarily good to wear. You know that. But now they've changed their mind. If they change their mind, that's good enough for me, so I wear it when appropriate. Please. (CROSSTALK) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Thank you, sir. A lot of Americans may be surprised at your change of tone over all of this, more perhaps realistic tone, some would look at it that way, the sudden embrace of masks, social distancing, the -- TRUMP: Well, I've always agreed with that. I mean, I've never fought either one but certainly social distancing. I want to -- it's that's common sense. Six feet for me is common sense. I'd like to say maybe make it a little bit further. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The idea that things will get worse, perhaps before they get better here. And perhaps the realization that this resurgence, if you will, is for real, when you used to talk about it in terms of little fires being put out here in the air. TRUMP: We have them too. You know, we have embers and fires and we have big fires and unfortunately now Florida is in a little tough or in a big tough position. You have a great governor there. You have a great governor in Texas. You have people that are very, very skilled people, and I think they're going to handle it very well. Their hospital capacity Holding up, but Texas is a big state and it's very well run and so is Florida and I think they'll do a very good job. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Why are you changing your tone though, sir? TRUMP: Go ahead. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I just wanted to ask you about the issue of vaccines which you already mentioned. Yesterday, a study by a Chinese company shows some promising results for its Coronavirus vaccine candidate. If China were first in developing the vaccine, or even if it weren't, would the administration be willing to work with China to bring a successful Chinese vaccine to the U.S.? TRUMP: Yes, we're willing to work with anybody that's going to get us a good result. We're very close to the vaccine. I think we're going to have some very good results. We're already in testing. Nobody thought that would be possible. Under the old system, it would be a year to two years before you could even think about using the word testing. So I think we've had a lot of -- and the reason with testing is they've had good results. So now we have to see in the testing also for safety, because they have to make sure it's safe. And I think you're going to see something over the next fairly short period of time, maybe a very short period of time having to do with therapeutics and vaccines that are very good. So we'll be doing these quite often. We're going to keep you abreast of this. And we'll also talk about some of the other topics like our economy, which is doing well. The stock market had another good day. I think they have a good day because they see a lot of positive things happening on this front, too. Thank you very much. Thank you. (CROSSTALK) (END VIDEOTAPE) WATTERS: That was the president right there briefing the American people from the White House podium on the Coronavirus, saying that things are going to get worse before they get better, striking a much more serious and measured tone about the virus. Talking about some of the successes that the administration has had 50 million tests done. The mortality rate and hospital stays being slashed in half since April. The National Guard medical personnel surging into the Southwest because it does look like the Sunbelt may be looking at becoming a hot spot. And the president saying we've learned a lot in the last few months about this fire sooner, much more and better prepared to take on whether it's a second wave or an emergence in certain different areas of the country. The governors have everything they need, the President said, and warn people to avoid packed bars and said wear masks, but said there will be no more shutdowns. And we are in advanced stages of vaccine testing. Let's take it around the table. Greg Gutfeld, what did you think about the President spoke for I think was just maybe 20 to 25 minutes there? GUTFELD: I thought we -- you know, he reigned in the impromptu and improvisational elements of his delivery. So, what you got was a very straight summary, which then it becomes shorter, because there's not -- there's not a lot of the side commentary. So I really don't know what CNN's excuses for not showing it. Because when you have someone go out there and it's delivering news to an American nation that needs it, it seems like -- I mean, imagine if you're watching CNN right now. Of course, you can't. But imagine if you did, you wouldn't have -- you wouldn't know this happened. WATTERS: Yes, it looks like they dialed it in when the questions were asked, but they didn't take the top where he delivered all of the factual information to the American people. GUTFELD: There you go. WATTERS: Dagen, what did you think about the President's presentation on substance and style? MCDOWELL: Well, he's owning it and he's leading. He was up there by himself with no one else speaking about what he, the White House, and the nation are doing to fight this virus. So, he is taking ownership of the future and the road ahead. And to -- he was asked about the economy. I will point out that because of the shutdowns, the country lost more than 22 million jobs in a matter of months, it's regained seven and a half million of those that's about 34 percent of the jobs have returned. And what is -- and what are they going to be doing in the months ahead? Well, there's another at least $1 trillion aid package. That's $600 extra per week, per week, extra per week that people have been getting in unemployment benefits. That has been a lifeline for many individuals. And he talked about extending that. It might be at a lower rate, at a lower amount, maybe sunset in the coming weeks, but that's not something -- despite pushback from some conservatives, that's not something that is going away. And that's going to give the economy a lift as we fight through this virus. WATTERS: Yes, Juan, the president clearly right at the top framing it as a Chinese virus and then multiple times during the presentation, talking about how this emerged from China, how China failed to stop it, and let people from Wuhan fly all over the world. Definitely a different position than the President had taken earlier during the pandemic. WILLIAMS: I think he's always been anxious to blame China. He didn't initially. Well, I think that was partly because he was involved in trying to get that trade deal done, Jesse. But subsequent to that he has been quick to blame China, to blame Fauci, to blame Obama. I don't know why he hasn't blamed. But I think that what stands out to me here is the change in tone that we've all discussed so far. And what strikes me on that point is that this is a president who was very slow to come around on the seriousness of the pandemic, and very slow, therefore, to engage things like the masks, and still his administration is talking about cutting funding for testing, cutting funding for tracing. That's very concerning. And also I would point out, he says, you know, 99 percent of these cases are in adults as if, oh, just reopen the schools when in fact, if the kids go home to mom, dad, two grandparents, to neighbors, they could spread the disease to people who are in fact quite vulnerable. But it's -- what strikes me is the question of his credibility speaking to the American people. Before he went on you, Jesse, Emily, everybody said, we hope he's more substantive and more direct in terms of delivering data. And I think it's at least a mix that he's defensive, and he's lowered the bar of kind of sprinkling magic dust, it's going to disappear magically. We're going to open everything by Easter. Clearly, that's gone. But he's still a very defensive man on this issue. WATTERS: I didn't see him as defensive. I thought he was pretty honest and forthright. Emily, what was your interpretation of today? COMPAGNO: That's exactly right, Jesse. I thought it was excellent. It was clear, competent, data-driven. And Juan pointed out, it seemed to be a shift, but I will just note that one of the final reporters at the end, that was sort of his question. He said, Mr. President, we seem to have sort of a straight in your approach here, and I just thought that was excellent. But to your question to me, Jesse, your second one at the top of the hour, it doesn't matter, that it's all about shaping. Because remember what the first question was from a reporter out of the gate was so Mr. President, we hear that you're getting multiple tests a day. There was no question on all of the facts and figures that the President presented in the beginning of the hour that was positive. And the biggest debate of all, the biggest line of questioning was the mask debate. Why don't you were one and whatever. No matter what you put in front of these people, there's always going to be a different shiny object that they're following. And respectfully Juan, to your point, that it's never going to be enough. If he sat there running out with his hair on fire. Oh, my gosh, this is the worst and most horrible thing. That still wouldn't be enough, even if the economy collapsed. But I thought right now, it was excellent. WATTERS: I think that was a good point. And every single question was framed as the President and the election and how it plays politically, not on the substance of the war on the Coronavirus. More on THE FIVE up next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) WILLIAMS: Welcome back. Joe Biden on the campaign trail today outlining a $775 billion plan for universal preschool, expanded childcare, and in-home elder care. Biden also taking shots at President Trump's leadership on rebuilding the economy. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: This man simply doesn't understand. He can't deal with our economic crisis without serving and saving and solving the public health crisis. For all his bluster about his expertise on the economy, he's unable to explain how it will actually help working families hit the hardest. You know, he's quit on you, and he's quit on this country. But this election is not just about him, it's about us. It's about you. (END VIDEO CLIP) WILLIAMS: President Trump has said the country will be doomed if the former V.P. is elected. Dagen, let me start with you and just go over some of the basics here. Biden said today, his build better -- build back better economic message includes caring for the elderly, as you heard, caring for children. It was an appeal to working parents. I think it's at its heart. Do you think it's good economic policy, good politics? Is it a good idea? MCDOWELL: I think that what he proposed today was actually really smart. And it will connect with people's hearts and their minds. And what I'm talking about is an appeal to older voters and even younger ones who are now taking care of their aging parents. 15 percent of the population was 65 or older back in 2015. It's going to be double that by 2060. And particularly during this pandemic, where you've seen thousands of elderly people die in nursing homes, and six out of 10 nursing home patients are already on Medicaid. He's proposing expanding the ability to take care of those loved ones in their houses. This is something that he can talk about -- well, he can talk about, again, from his heart. And again, remember the Democrats, Juan, you talked about this, they had their knickers in a twist about the ballooning budget deficit. Well, not anymore because of the pandemic's spending. It's going to be $5 trillion, so he can talk about spending as much as they want. WILLIAMS: Emily, the vice -- former vice president stressed a lot about empathy. Is that a shot at Trump and suggesting that the President is not caring, empathetic? COMPAGNO: Certainly, it is, yes. And I think that's no surprise and it's not out of left field, right? The vice president has certainly made that clear that he -- how he feels about the President's empathetic qualities. I will say that the good thing about him outlining these specific proposals is that it enables the president to get specific in his critique of them. We talked about yesterday the need for both the president and Biden to articulate what they would do in either the second term or his first term respectively, and now it's about each of them sort of being able to specifically critique, and for the President's part, not being able to just call him Sleepy Joe Biden. I think the American people are a lot smarter, however, than Joe Biden gives them credit for, as they will see through the fact that he claims he's pro-union, but it's not a pro job policy. WILLIAMS: Greg, also on the campaign trail, but in Congress today, you have Democrats asking the FBI for a briefing on interference in the 2020 race. Is it possible to stop it? GUTFELD: I'm not interested in that. I'm more interested in the plan. We haven't even discussed the name of the plan. WATTERS: Yes. GUTFELD: The -- here's the name of the plan. The Biden plan for mobilizing American talent and heart to create a 21st-century caregiving and education workforce. So, my question is, is his staff intentionally creating titles for things that Joe Biden couldn't remember, because if that title gotten any longer, we would have to preempt a special report. I mean, who came up with that? What working group sat in an office and came up with that garbage? It shows you that 95 percent of the people that work in government could not get a real job because they're incompetent. And it also shows you that even the sentences, even the sentences in government are bloated. It's embarrassing. And it's amazing how the media treats Biden so lightly, they handle them like he's an IED inside of Faberge egg. I would have been laughing my butt off if I heard that. WILLIAMS: You don't like Build Back Better? OK, OK. So, Jesse, last night, Biden said -- Biden said something about you know there are four black women on his V.P. pick but he's not committed. And the polls show Warren is doing best among independent voters, swing-state voters. What do you think? Where is this V.P. chase going? WATTERS: I honestly don't care who he chooses for V.P., Juan. I'm not interested in that. I don't think Biden can remember who's on his list. He can't remember the name of his plan, as Gutfeld said. I tried to read this thing. It was soul-crushing, mind-numbing, and I threw it in a furnace when I was finished with it. He basically says he's going to send people to take care of your grandparents, and then he's going to have people take care of your kids, but then he's going to shut down the whole economy again. So, who's going to take care of you? I have no idea. WILLIAMS: All right, stay with us. A lot more to come on THE FIVE. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) WATTERS: It's time now for \"ONE MORE THING.\" Some of you noticed but I've developed a new style here on THE FIVE, no tie. I got a little pushback from some people. There it is. So, what we're going to do, we're going to have the audience decide, leaving the tie, or put the tie back on. Go to the Instagram page and vote. Should Jesse go back to wearing a tie? My mom says yes, but some of you disagree. We will see and read the results next \"ONE MORE THING. Greg, you're up next. GUTFELD: I would like to see you in a bolo tie and nothing else. All right, let's do this. Yes. Dogs on skateboard news. That's well done. All right, sometimes when you're skateboarding and you're a dog, you need another dog to help you out. Check out this pair, getting ready to go. It's a pretty slow commute, but then he gets a little help from his friend. Isn't that sweet? I told you this was dogs on skateboard news. That's enough for me. WATTERS: Juan, you're up. COMPAGNO: Cute. WILLIAMS: All right, so you know it's a small, small world as they say it, Disney's exhibit on different people around the globe. Now, a third-grader in California has raised money to bring more color into her small world. Take a look at Madison Wilson of Solvang, California, the seven-year-old, one of three black children in her school raised $37,000 to buy crayons on the color of different skin tones. Crayola has a new line of crayons perfect for her called colors of the world, 24 new colors representing 40 skin tones around the world. She's going to buy not only crayons but books, multicultural books for several schools. I think they should have a color called sparkling big star because that's Madison. WATTERS: All right, a lot of Crayola. Dagen McDowell. MCDOWELL: Keep the tie or lose it but don't wear flip flops. Men should wear flip flops ever. WATTERS: Sorry, I apologize. MCDOWELL: Here's a dog eating a burrito with his human. There you go. it's not good boy Carl, cat temps dog. Corn dog Carl eats with chopsticks. COMPAGNO: Oh, my god that is so cute, he's like a squirrel. WATTERS: All right, everybody. See you. BRET BAIER, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Thanks, Jesse. Welcome to Washington. I am Bret Baier.

To me, that signifies a stealthy handoff of documents or encoded digital communication to get dirt into the hands of reporters. The Trump team is just stabbing Fauci in the front.And they\u2019re doing it by pointing to his past public statements, which are obviously fair game.Behind the scenes, the president hasn\u2019t spoken to Fauci in more than a month.Make no mistake, the president is the decision-maker and Fauci is a medical expert who, by his own account, is not in charge of setting policy. Still, the 79-year-old doctor, who has been part of the government\u2019s infectious disease agency since the Reagan administration, is widely respected, and part of his job is to work on a vaccine.For an administration that has been accused of ignoring science, this seems somewhat petty. But there is an important clash here: Fauci casts himself as a truth-teller, and Trump wants to control the administration\u2019s message, which is that the pandemic is under control and things will be getting better.That, admittedly, is a harder sell when the number of new daily Covid-19 cases surged past 66,000 heading into the weekend, and Florida broke the single-day record for a state on Sunday with more than 15,000 cases. And it comes at a time when the president is pressuring governors, with a threatened funding cutoff, to physically reopen the nation\u2019s schools in September.What the White House has done, among other things, is basically kept Fauci off television. \u201cFace the Nation\u201d host Margaret Brennan told viewers she\u2019s been trying to book him for three months. The coronavirus task force briefings have become infrequent, handed off to Mike Pence and moved out of the White House, and Fauci\u2019s schedule was such that he couldn\u2019t attend the last one.Instead, he\u2019s been doing podcasts and print interviews, such as one in which he told the: \u201cI have a reputation, as you have probably figured out, of speaking the truth at all times and not sugar-coating things. And that may be one of the reasons why I haven\u2019t been on television very much lately.\u201dThe  reports that White House communications aides did approve appearances by Fauci on the PBS \u201cNewsHour,\u201d \u201cMeet the Press\u201d and a CNN town hall. But those were canceled after Fauci did a Facebook Live event with Democratic Sen. Doug Jones and disputed Trump\u2019s assertion that the country\u2019s lower death rate was a sign of progress, calling that a \u201cfalse narrative.\u201d\u201cOur bigger issue with Fauci is stop critiquing the task force .\u2009.\u2009. and try to fix it,\u201d an administration official told the Post.Trump, for his part, has called Fauci \u201ca nice man, but he\u2019s made a lot of mistakes.\u201dWhich brings us to the official counterattack.\u201cSeveral White House officials are concerned about the number of times Dr. Fauci has been wrong on things,\u201d says a statement sent by the White House to reporters.The Post says this \u201cincluded a lengthy list of the scientist\u2019s comments from early in the outbreak. Those included his early doubt that people with no symptoms could play a significant role in spreading the virus...They also point to public reassurances Fauci made in late February, around the time of the first U.S. case of community transmission, that \u201cat this moment, there is no need to change anything that you\u2019re doing on a day-by-day basis.\u201dSure he\u2019s made some missteps, Fauci\u2019s supporters say. But when he downplayed the need for masks early on, it was because he was worried about a shortage and wanted to keep them for health care workers.The , in picking up the story yesterday, said the White House left out Fauci\u2019s words, in an NBC interview, immediately after his \u201cno need to change anything\u201d comment:\u201cRight now the risk is still low, but this could change. When you start to see community spread, this could change and force you to become much more attentive to doing things that would protect you from spread.\u201dAsked yesterday by CNN\u2019s Jim Acosta why the White House was \u201ctrashing\u201d Fauci, press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said the statement came in response to the Post\u2019s questions and the two men \u201chave always had a very good working relationship.\u201dThe president has mentioned Fauci\u2019s high approval ratings. A Times poll last month found that 67 percent of Americans trusted Fauci on Covid-19, while 26 percent trusted Trump.If Fauci was a political appointee, he\u2019d probably have gone the way of Jeff Sessions, Jim Mattis and John Bolton\u00a0by now. But as a career civil servant, he can\u2019t be fired. So the White House is clearly sidelining him instead.It\u2019s a shame the two men, despite their contrasting styles, can\u2019t find a way to work together, as this is a distraction in the war on their common enemy: the virus itself.Footnote: President Trump has retweeted the following missive from game show host Chuck Woolery:\u201cThe most outrageous lies are the ones about Covid 19. Everyone is lying. The CDC, Media, Democrats, our Doctors, not all but most ,that we are told to trust. I think it\u2019s all about the election and keeping the economy from coming back, which is about the election. I\u2019m sick of it\u2026There is so much evidence, yes scientific evidence, that schools should open this fall. It\u2019s worldwide and it\u2019s overwhelming.

I'm Bret Baier. Breaking tonight, President Trump says he is canceling the Jacksonville, Florida component of the Republican National Convention, the president saying just a short time ago, the business of the convention will take place in Charlotte, North Carolina, as was originally planned. We're expected to get more details about how all of that will play out in coming days. He notes the Jacksonville, Florida area is a coronavirus hot spot. The president once again defending his call for all students to return to classrooms this coming semester in that press briefing with reporters just a few -- short time ago. Senate Republicans and the administration officials have dropped the idea of a payroll tax cut from the negotiations over a new round of coronavirus aid. The Senate majority leader says he will release a framework for a new bill next week, they were hoping to do it this week. We'll talk live with the White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows about this and other topics in just a few minutes. This occurs as the U.S. passes the four million mark in infections, more than 143,000 Americans have died in this country. An associated press poll indicates three out of four Americans favor requiring people to wear masks outside of their homes. Here in the nation's capital, face coverings are now mandatory. Meantime, applications for first-time jobless benefits went up this week for the first time in months. Also breaking tonight, new Fox battleground state polls, the president trailing Joe Biden in three key battleground states, we'll bring that to you in a minute. Chief White House correspondent John Roberts starts us off though as he often does on the North Lawn. Good evening, John. JOHN ROBERTS, FOX NEWS CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Just a typical Thursday here at the White House, Bret. You'll recall that a couple of months ago, President Trump told Roy Cooper the governor of North Carolina, if he couldn't guarantee that they could have a big event in Charlotte for the big speech night at the convention, that they were going to move it. The president was happy to have it in Jacksonville he said this afternoon. His team came in with drawings of what they had put together, and he said the drawings were very compelling but the situation in Florida with the explosion in coronavirus cases, just meant that he could not go down there and have a large crowd to watch him give the acceptance speech, here's what the president said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I looked at my team and I said, the timing for this event is not right, it's just not right with what's happened recently. The flare up in Florida, to have a big convention is not the right time. It's really something that for me, I have to protect the American people. (END VIDEO CLIP) ROBERTS: So the president did not have an alternative at least at this point as to how he will give that big convention acceptance speech. It may be some sort of a virtual event, it may be something else but it's not going to be the big event that he had planned for Jacksonville. The president also as you mentioned at the top here Bret, talking about the issue of school reopening, saying that the Centers for Disease Control will in the next few hours come out with new guidelines that schools can use to decide whether or not they're going to reopen. But federal guidelines aside, this really comes down to a local and state level and on all of those levels, the debate is raging over what to do. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ROBERTS: Proponents of children going back to class point to science that shows they contract and transmit coronavirus at a far lower rate than adults. KAYLEIGH MCENANY, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: This president's been clear, we want schools to reopen. You have the CDC director saying it's a greater public health threat for schools to stay close than open. ROBERTS: Governors like Florida's Ron DeSantis trying to balance concerns about health with concerns about learning. GOV. RON DESANTIS (R-FL): In Florida, what we tell parents is look, if you're not comfortable with that, yes, you have the right to maintain distance learning, that's fine. We want to do what parent want but we have a lot of parents that think that their kids will fall behind if they're not able to get back inside the classroom. ROBERTS: A new Associated Press poll finds only eight percent of Americans say schools should reopen as usual, 14 percent would say it would be possible with minor adjustments but 46 percent say it would take major adjustments. And there is a big split between Democrats and Republicans over keeping schools closed, 44 percent of Democrats say schools should not reopen, just 14 percent of Republicans think that. On Capitol Hill, Senate Republicans say they have reached agreement on money for schools in a phase four relief package, $105 billion, about $1,200 per student. SEN. LAMAR ALEXANDER (R-TN): It's a very generous amount of money half to go to every school and the other half would go to try to encourage and help those schools that are trying to open in person. People that have -- when you have to hire extra teachers and put up barriers and buy a protective equipment, they're more expensive there. ROBERTS: Democrats who passed a $3 trillion monster phase four relief package back in May mocking their Senate colleagues for taking so long. SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY): They can't come together. Even after all this time, it appears the Republican legislative response to COVID is unified, unserious, unsatisfactory. ROBERTS: One thing that won't be in the Senate's phase four bill, a payroll tax cut. Republicans saying it won't happen but the president will still fight to eventually make it so. STEVEN MNUCHIN, U.S. TREASURY SECRETARY: Not in this but we're going to come back again. You know, there may be a CARES 5.0. The president again is focused on money and American workers and American pockets right now. ROBERTS: The relief bill aside, the White House has another coronavirus problem, a cafeteria worker at the Eisenhower Executive Office Building testing positive for the virus. The White House Medical Office has done contact tracing and determined no one else was at risk. But out of caution, the cafeteria and Ike's Eatery in the building will both close for two weeks. (END VIDEOTAPE) ROBERTS: Now, back on the president canceling the Jacksonville part of the Republican Convention. You know, during a campaign, there were really just a couple of moments -- big moments, where you can move the needle in terms of public opinion. There's the debates and then there's the convention and that big night with a speech. The present will give that up and will have to try to find a different way to move the needle, but the president saying this afternoon Bret, that setting the example is important, Bret. BAIER: John Roberts live on the North Lawn. John thanks. As we mentioned, breaking tonight at the top, we're giving you the first look tonight at new Fox polls for several battleground states. Not good news for the president in these polls, Joe Biden leads in Pennsylvania 50 to 39, the president has lost three points since April. In 2016, candidate Trump won that state by less than one percentage point. In Michigan, the margin is nine, 49 to 40, that's a one-point gain again for Biden. President Trump won that state four years ago by three-tenths of a percent. And in Minnesota, Biden is up 13 points, 51-38. Donald Trump lost that state in 2016 by 1-1/2 percent to Hillary Clinton. The two men who will be at the top of the ticket in November are spending this week arguing over racism. Joe Biden says President Trump is the first racist elected to the top job, the president says that's an affront to African-Americans and the Trump campaign is pointing back to Joe Biden's past comments. Correspondent Peter Doocy has the latest tonight. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PETER DOOCY, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Joe Biden believes 45 is a first. JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We've had racists and they've exist and they've tried to get elected president. He's the first one that has. DOOCY: President Trump's campaign says this is an insult to the intelligence of Black voters. And Trump himself is trying to add historical context. TRUMP: I've done more for Black Americans than anybody with the possible exception of Abraham Lincoln. DOOCY: 12 U.S. presidents at some point in their lives owned slaves, Woodrow Wilson name was just stripped from a school at Princeton because of his past segregationist policies. And Andrew Jackson is set to be replaced within a decade on the $20.00 bill design by Harriet Tubman after review of his record of mistreating slaves and Native Americans, but Biden insists, Trump is the first racist. BIDEN: The way he pets people against one another is all designed to divide the country, divide people. DOOCY: If there's one Biden attack on Trump that's been consistent since day one, it's this. Central theme of this announcement video was President Trump's response to deadly race riots in Charlottesville. BIDEN: He said there were, quote, some very fine people on both sides, very fine people on both sides? DOOCY: Registered voters in a new Fox News poll trust Biden over Trump in every leading issue in battleground Minnesota but Trump has more trust on the economy in battleground's Michigan and Pennsylvania. Now, Biden is hoping to hold his overall lead with help from his old boss. BARACK OBAMA, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: What kind of values are you communicating? BIDEN: Bingo. (END VIDEOTAPE) DOOCY: That's part of a 15-minute long streaming campaign video with Biden and Obama who reportedly got paid $15 million to develop streaming content for Netflix. But it appears he did this one for his former V.P. for free, Bret. BAIER: All right, Peter, thank you. Its official, one of the Portland protests that really have become nightly confrontations with law enforcement has officially now been declared a riot. That designation applies to last Saturday's event. Meantime, the Justice Department inspector general is launching a probe into law enforcement in Oregon and also federal efforts here in Washington, D.C. The situation in Portland puts into clearer focus President Trump's decision to put federal forces on the streets. Correspondent Dan Springer shows us the situation seems to be getting worse. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DAN SPRINGER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: It was one of the most violent nights yet in Portland. A new fence put up around the federal courthouse did not stem the chaos. Arsonists through Molotov cocktails and hundreds of fireworks over it, vandals cut through it. While Portland police state away, federal officers there to protect the courthouse and federal buildings repeatedly fired tear gas and deployed flash bang devices. Mayor Ted Wheeler showed up for what he called a listening session. But when he spoke, he was shouted down with obscenities, called a Nazi, spit at and told to resign. Then, while next to the fence, he was hit with tear gas, telling one reporter he saw nothing to provoke that response. After a second guessing, his security detail took him to cover in a nearby city building. It all happen the same day the city council passed a law banning Portland police from helping federal officers in any way, even in life-threatening situations. Oregon's governor joins the call for the Fed's delete. GOV. KATE BROWN (D-OR): This is a democracy, not a dictatorship. We cannot have secret police abducting people in to -- and putting them in unmarked vehicles. I cannot believe I have to say that to the president of the United States. SPRINGER: President Trump is sending federal agents to other cities not to protect federal buildings but to help solve murders and stem the tide of violent crime. Chicago will get 200 agents, Albuquerque 35. (END VIDEOTAPE) SPRINGER: The mayors of 16 cities signed a letter to President Trump saying they don't want any federal agents sent their way, among them the mayor of Seattle who battled Trump over the CHOP protest zone. And now comes word that the Seattle chapter of the Youth Liberation Front is planning a big protest here for this weekend, Bret. BAIER: Dan, thank you. Let's talk about the major issues facing this White House with a man on the inside, the inner circle, White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows. Thanks for being here. MARK MEADOWS, WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF: Great to be with you, Bret. Thanks so much. BAIER: First I want to talk about the breaking news, the president making that announcement about Jacksonville, he's -- was he disappointed? MEADOWS: Well, I think for all of us, we're disappointed that we can't have the convention but it's a responsible and really dedicated decision by the president of the United States to focus not only on the safety of those that might be attending but really on the safety of all Americans to keep focused on making sure that we combat this China virus and make sure that we have vaccines. And so, he made one of the most difficult decisions that any president or politician might have to make, which is saying that what we're going to do is put aside those partisan politics and make sure that we actually focus on what is key. And yet, it was an easy decision for him because he says we're going to put the American people first, we're going to focus on make sure that we get testing for those schools and day care centers and nursing homes done, but more importantly than that, open back our schools in a safe and responsible way. And we've been working around the clock with some of our colleagues on Capitol Hill to get that done. BAIER: Well, I want to talk about that. Where are you with that? There seem to be kind of this giant exhale upon Capitol Hill of frustration really that they couldn't get a bill out this week. Where are Republicans, where is your negotiation tonight? MEADOWS: Well, we've had a number of discussions with our Republican senators on Capitol Hill over the last couple of days, Secretary Mnuchin has done a great job in doing that. But I think the real frustration is really about trying to make sure that we focus on a couple of key components. We know that we have unemployment insurance and those who are still unemployed and receiving those benefits with that about to expire next week. We also know that we have businesses that continue to remain in unbelievably difficult circumstances. So what we're trying to do is focus on those priorities and yet, the Democrats have put together some $3 trillion. We found that they were not really serious about their effort that they put forth, so we're trying to make sure that we get the immediate needs first and then continue to negotiate perhaps throughout most of August until we get something finished. BAIER: Yes, here's how Politico wrote it this afternoon and I want to just get your reaction. MEADOWS: Sure. BAIER: Senate Republicans in the White House wasted a week at the worst possible time. Amid a series of crises with 30 million Americans unemployed, coronavirus cases spiking nationally White House officials, Senate GOP leaders couldn't even come to an agreement among themselves on a starting point for a new relief package, let alone begin bipartisan talks with Democrats. Privately, GOP lawmakers were flabbergasted that they'll likely have to wait until next week to unveil even an initial proposal. And we found out from the Senate Majority Leader that's exactly what it's going to be, a framework. Where is the sticking point? So there's a payroll tax is out, right? MEADOWS: Well, the president made that decision primarily because we knew that the Democrats saw that as an asked and something that would benefit all American wage earners. And yet, they -- because the president was asking for it, they made it clear that, that was a nonstarter for them. We did have some on the Republican side expressing concern. But instead of going all-in on that with the president, we made a decision to start focusing on not only the unemployment, insurance, but liability protection, the PPP extension, and help for schools. That $105 billion that you've already reported on. And so, where we are specifically is, is that we -- we're offering some of those things that help the people that are in most need right now. And yet, there is wish list. The $2 trillion or $3 trillion wish list that the Democrats are putting forth that are -- is just really beyond reasonable in terms of what they might consider is, is appropriate and realistic. So, I can tell you that the discussions continue on. We have line by line that we are going through that we -- we've gotten from our Republican senators, trying to make sure that it actually meets the needs of the American people. But I'm -- the president has made one thing clear. We're going to make sure that we have something there for those that are struggling the most, and that we keep this economy going, and I'm confident that we'll get there. BAIER: You know, your opponents are obviously jumping all over this. Saying, Republicans can get their act together on this, and it sends a message about November. What's your reaction to that? MEADOWS: Well, I mean -- listen, opponents on Capitol Hill, will always speak out against this president, they consistently do. When you look at a $3 trillion package that they put forth several weeks ago, not even their own members took it serious. I mean, when you look at the amount of money that they're asking for state and local health, they've actually put a number in there that equals their entire revenue for half a year. I mean, it's just -- it's not reasonable. BAIER: Yes. MEADOWS: It's not rational. And so, as we look at it, it's easy to put numbers on a piece of paper. That's what they've done, put numbers on a piece of paper. It's much more difficult to be responsible about that, because it's not our money, it's the American taxpayer's money. BAIER: You know what I hear a lot though? I hear a lot that -- you know, why can the Democrats: Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer, cracked the whip and get Democrats to fall in line, but Republicans can't when push comes to shove. And I ask you this as a former member of the House Freedom Caucus, who stood up against the number of votes that the party wanted to do. (CROSSTALK) MEADOWS: Yes. Sure. Right, well, it's really easy when you're spending someone else's money, Bret. Eventually, you run out of other people's money. We already know that and just because we're starting to talk about a trillion here or a trillion there, it doesn't make it responsible. The bill that the Democrats have put forth is not even reasonable when it comes to the needs. Even with their best estimates, they have to smile when they put forth some of the numbers. And I can tell you, we'll get to the -- to the bottom of it, we'll make sure that we do it right. The president is committed to that. BAIER: How concerned are you about polls inside the White House? We have these new state polls where the president's approval-disapproval is upside down in these three key states, Michigan, Minnesota, and Pennsylvania. Trust on the job on coronavirus, even on the economy, the edge is really, really tight. How concerned are you about all of this? MEADOWS: Listen, I don't talk about the polls, I look at policy because policy always drives the polls. When you put two things in place, the policy and the people is your number one priority, it always works out at the end. And ultimately, the only poll that counts is in November. When you look at, at what we're seeing though, is we've had a president that has not only performed before but will do it again. And the great thing is -- about all of this is, is that we actually have a president who has a track record, you know, it's not someone in a basement without one. BAIER: Yes, I want to follow up on something you told Maria Bartiromo over the weekend. And you said that the American people expect indictments in this investigation of the investigation. MEADOWS: Right. BAIER: The Durham report we haven't heard when it's coming out. If it's coming out, do you have any sense of when it's coming and what may be holding it up? MEADOWS: Well, that's under the Department of Justice. I wouldn't have any visibility in terms of a time frame with John Durham in the investigation that he is conducting. I can tell you this based on documents that I saw in my previous career, based on what I know going forward. There should be accountability, the American people expect it. And yet, at the same time, they would be extremely disappointed if people are not held accountable. This president indeed was spied on, and he was spied on by a government that shouldn't be involved in that, and those people do need to be held accountable. BAIER: We appreciate your time. Please come back and you think something will come together next week? MEADOWS: Well, we will certainly have something for the Democrats to vote on next week. And I can -- I can tell you, it's going to put the people of America and those that are suffering the most as our number one priority. BAIER: White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, thanks. MEADOWS: Thank you. BAIER: Up next, it's finally time to hear play ball for Major League Baseball. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, FORMER FOX NEWS POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: But all the glory, you know, and with the White House on fire, the Congress in chaos, and the world going to hell in a handbasket, we need happy news like this. This is why God created baseball late on the sixth day. (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: Wise words from the late great Charles Krauthammer. By the way, I was wearing the same tie that day. Our dear friend was the biggest Washington Nationals fan of all. We are just an hour away from hearing those words, play ball, for the first time, in what will be an abbreviated Major League Baseball season because of coronavirus. The first game features the defending World Series champion Washington Nationals hosting the New York Yankees. Lucas Tomlinson is at Nationals Park tonight. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) LUCAS TOMLINSON, FOX NEWS STATE DEPARTMENT PRODUCER: It's not the start Major League Baseball had in mind, but after nearly four months, baseball is back but in empty stadiums. Dr. Fauci will be throwing out the first pitch tonight at Nats Park, and while he's become somewhat of a celebrity in the fight against coronavirus, he tells Nationals' first baseman Ryan Zimmerman, he's not feeling as confident about throwing out the first pitch. DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES: And I'm quite nervous about it. Yes. RYAN ZIMMERMAN, FIRST BASEMAN, WASHINGTON NATIONALS: OK. Well, don't worry about it, if you bounce it, there's nobody there to boo you. So, you'll be good to go. You're fine. TOMLINSON: There are some new rules for the 60-game season. The National League adds a designated hitter, a runner on second base will begin extra innings, and there'll be no face-to-face arguments with umpires. Major League Baseball, also announced it will show support for the Black Lives Matter movement. Earlier this week, some San Francisco Giants players and the manager kneeled during the national anthem at an exhibition game. Nancy Pelosi praised the move. REP. NANCY PELOSI, (D-CA): I'm so proud of Gabe Kapler, our new general manager who knelt with them. TOMLINSON: Unlike the NBA and NHL, all 30 big league clubs will travel around the country over the next two months. The Nationals will play in some COVID hot spots and make a 10-game road trip in three cities which could make it challenging for any contact tracing if anyone tests positive for coronavirus. Even though stadiums will be empty, Fox Sports will be adding thousands of virtual fans in the seats during broadcast, so people at home can have a feel of a sold-out stadium. (END VIDEOTAPE) TOMLINSON: Late this afternoon, Nationals general manager Mike Rizzo, announced his star outfielder Juan Soto, tested positive of the coronavirus and is out for tonight's season opener, Bret. BAIER: All right. Lucas, thank you. We'll have to see how that virtual fan thing works. Stocks were down today because of initial jobless claims rising for the first time since March. We told you about that earlier. The Dow lost 353- 1/2. The S&P 500 dropped 40, the NASDAQ plummeted 245. Up next, the canceled culture eating its own. We'll explain. First, here is what some of our Fox affiliates around the country are covering tonight. Fox 5 in New York as a judge ordered the release from prison of former Trump personal lawyer Michael Cohen. The judge, saying he believes the government retaliated against Cohen for writing a book about President Trump. A book expected to be very negative to the president. Cohen, sued the government earlier this week, saying he was ordered back to prison on July 9th over the book issue. Fox 9 in the Twin Cities as Minnesota Democrat Governor Tim Walz, signs a police accountability bill into law. It includes a ban on neck restraints like the one used on George Floyd before his death in Minneapolis. Bill also prohibits chokeholds and so-called warrior style training, which critics say promotes excessive force. And this is a live look at Austin, Texas from our affiliate Fox 7. One of the big stories there tonight, a storm watch is in effect for the Texas coast after the formation of a tropical depression in the Gulf of Mexico. The system is expected to become Tropical Storm Hanna, Friday, before making landfall south of the Houston area. That is tonight's live look \"OUTSIDE THE BELTWAY\" from SPECIAL REPORT. We'll be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BAIER: A cautionary tale tonight for the so-called cancel culture. The arbiters of the latest fad of political correctness continue to chip away at traditional American figures, but they also are turning on members of the liberal culture from which they came. Correspondent Doug McKelway shows us this evening. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY): Mobs have dragged statues of Washington, Jefferson, and Grant through the dirt. DOUG MCKELWAY, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: While Mitch McConnell was attacking the so-called cancel culture on the Senate floor Wednesday, the House was debating whether to remove 16 statues, including the bust of Supreme Court Chief Justice Roger Taney, a Democrat and author of 1857 Dred Scott decision that denied African-Americans citizenship. REP. STENY HOYER (D-MD): What Dred Scott said was black lives did not matter. We assert that yes, they do matter. MCKELWAY: On Tuesday Planned Parenthood removed the name of its founder, Margaret Sanger, from its New York City clinic. Sanger advocated for sterilization to stop the reproduction of, quote, \"inferior people.\" BENJAMIN WATSON, FORMER NFL PLAYER: That's surprising considering what they said over the last several years about her, giving out awards in her honor and touting her as a hero. But now is a time of reckoning, as it should be. MCKELWAY: A similar cancelling for John Muir, the father of national parks. He founded the Sierra Club which announced it's ending its association with Muir, describing him as a, quote, \"white supremacist\" who drew on deeply harmful racial stereotypes. As many as 80 global and American companies, some often identified as progressive, are also facing uncomfortable pressure. Republican Senator Josh Hawley introduced a bill on Monday that would hold them accountable for what Hawley says is slave labor in their supply chains. Among those cited by Hawley, Nike, Adidas, Puma, Lenovo, Samsung, Starbucks, and Nespresso. Asked recently what she thought of cancel culture and the tearing down a Columbus statue, Speaker Pelosi said this. REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA): People will do what they do. MCKELWAY: In Pelosi's childhood home of Baltimore, a statue of Columbus was toppled and throw into the Inner Harbor this month. Statues of Confederate Generals Robert E. Lee and Stonewall Jackson were taken down two years ago after Charlottesville. They had been dedicated in 1948 by her father, Mayor Thomas D'Alesandro, who said that the statues, quote, \"remind us to be resolute in preserving our sacred institutions.\" (END VIDEOTAPE) MCKELWAY: On Wednesday, the House voted to remove all 16 statues, but 113 members, all Republicans, voted against it, and it's doubtful the Senate will take up anything similar. Bret? BAIER: Doug McKelway up on the Hill. Doug, thanks. The main focus tonight in legal proceedings against a woman accused of helping late financier and pedophile Jeffrey Epstein recruit underaged girls appears to be what information becomes public now. Correspondent Laura Ingle looks at the latest decisions. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) LAURA INGLE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: The documents in question date back to a civil defamation case filed against Ghislaine Maxwell by Jeffrey Epstein accuser Virginia Giuffre. The case was settled and the documents sealed. Many have since been unsealed, like ones that detailed Giuffre's accusations that Maxwell made her have sex with Prince Andrew at age 17. Giuffre is fighting to release more. Maxwell is fighting to stop it, citing potential embarrassment. The judge ruling against her, saying, quote, \"any minor embarrassment or annoyance resulting from disclosure of Ms. Maxwell's mostly non-testimony about behavior that has been widely reported in the press is far outweighed by the presumption of public access.\" The judge deciding to release thousands more pages, including the transcript of Maxwell's seven-hour long deposition, and why she is facing perjury charges today. The judge ruled nearly all the remaining documents should be released, but the names of certain John Doe's not yet made public should remain redacted. A name once known to run in Maxwell's circles is President Trump, something he admitted this week. TRUMP: I've met her numerous times over the years, especially since I lived in Palm Beach, and I guess they lived in Palm Beach. But I wish her well. INGLE: But as Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany points out, President Trump banned Jeffrey Epstein from Mar-a-Lago long ago. KAYLEIGH MCENANY, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: This president was always on top of this, ahead of this, noting this, banning this man from his property long before this case was even played out in a court of law. (END VIDEOTAPE) INGLE: Despite the judge's ruling to release these long awaited and potentially explosive documents, there will be nothing to read for at least a week while Maxwell's lawyers file an appeal. Bret? BAIER: We'll follow it. Laura, thank you. New York Democratic Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez used some shocking language today on the House floor because she was quoting what a Republican colleague said to her. Her comments come following a verbal exchange with Florida Republican Ted Yoho Monday in which he used the profane sexist slur that the congresswoman repeated in her speech. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. ALEXANDRA OCASIO-CORTEZ, (D-NY): In front of reporters, Representative Yoho called me, and I quote, a -- These are the words that Representative Yoho levied against a congresswoman. (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: We added the beep. Yoho has apologized for what he called his, quote, abrupt manner. Ocasio-Cortez did not accept that apology. When we come back, will President Trump withdraw all U.S. forces from Afghanistan? (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BAIER: Witnesses in Afghanistan say a government air strike killed at least 14 people, many of them women and children. It happened as hundreds of them gathered to welcome a former Taliban fighter freed from jail. The U.S. peace envoy to Afghanistan tweeted a condemnation of the strike, welcoming a government investigation. One of President Trump's campaign promises from 2016 was to end what he called America's involvement in endless wars. It's a message he continues to deliver to this day. But is that strategy working? Here is national security correspondent Jennifer Griffin. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JENNIFER GRIFFIN, FOX NEWS NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: A peace deal with the Taliban the Trump administration hopes will allow U.S. troops to come home after 19 years of war, past the 135 day mark this week. But the agreement, signed in February, remains fragile. CENTCOM Commander General Frank McKenzie had this warning in an interview with \"Voice of America.\" GEN. KENNETH F. MCKENZIE, CENTCOM COMMANDER: And while the Taliban have been scrupulous about not attacking U.S. or coalition forces. In fact, the violence against the Afghans is higher than it has been in quite a while. GRIFFIN: The U.S.-Taliban deal calls for a full U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan within 14 months, something the president campaigned on and hopes to achieve by November. TRUMP: We want to bring our people back home. GRIFFIN: Since February, the U.S. has drawn down to 8,600 troops and withdrawn from five bases in Afghanistan as part of the deal, roughly the same number of troops as when President Obama left office, down from a high of 100,000 in 2010. No U.S. troops have been killed in Afghanistan since the deal was signed. The Pentagon continues to say it has found no evidence the Russians paid bounties that led to the death of any American troops. JONATHAN HOFFMAN, CHIEF PENTAGON SPOKESPERSON: We've not found any corroborating evidence that would indicate that there was a bounty program. GRIFFIN: Secretary of State Mike Pompeo spoke to his Russian counterpart about working together in Afghanistan. MIKE POMPEO, SECRETARY OF STATE: We think it's in Russia's best interest. We think it's in China's best interest. We know it's in the Afghan people's best interest. (END VIDEOTAPE) GRIFFIN: The House version of the National Defense Authorization Act includes an amendment from Democrat Jason Crow of Colorado and Liz Cheney of Wyoming that would require the administration to make several certifications to Congress before it can draw down any further in Afghanistan. Bret? BAIER: Jennifer Griffin at the Pentagon. Jennifer, thank you. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told an audience at the Nixon Library in California the U.S. ordered Beijing to close its consulate in Houston because it was a hub of spying and intellectual property theft. Tonight on \"The Story\" with Martha MacCallum, Pompeo talks at length about the deteriorating U.S. relationship with China. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) POMPEO: When you see what the Chinese Communist Party has done to our country and to the world with their failure to live up to another set of promises that they made to the world about their responsibility if a pandemic began to break out in their country, the cover-up that took place, you can absently understand why a trade deal like the phase one trade deal no longer ranks first of all the various issues we have with the Chinese Communist Party. (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: Secretary Pompeo, you can see that interview with Martha at the top of the hour. The U.S. is accusing Russia of conducting a test of antisatellite weapons in space, saying it's Moscow's intent to deploy weapons that threaten U.S. and allied satellites. The head of the British space agency agreed, writing on Twitter Russia launched a projectile with characteristics of a weapon. Russia says the event was an inspection of a satellite using special equipment. Next up, the panel with reaction to today's presidential news conference and the cancellation of Jacksonville as the RNC convention, plus my interview with the White House chief of staff. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: I looked at my team and I said the timing for this event is not right. It's just not right, with what has happened recently, the flare up in Florida, to have a big convention. It's not the right time. It's really something that for me, I have to protect the American people. (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: President Trump canceling the Jacksonville, Florida, part of the convention. If you remember, it was eight weeks ago he moved from Charlotte, North Carolina, because of too strict health situation, he wanted to have a bigger party atmosphere. But within eight weeks, the spike in Florida changed this, and he has canceled that, so now making plans for a very different Republican convention. This as some new key battleground state polls come out tonight. FOX polls Michigan, Minnesota, Pennsylvania, and you can see Joe Biden leading in all of those, various numbers there. The president's job performance upside- down, underwater in all three states, Michigan, Minnesota, and Pennsylvania. And then this is probably the biggest spread, trust to do a better job on coronavirus in those three states, 19, 23, and 18 points difference in our latest FOX News poll. Let's bring in our panel, Matthew Continetti, founding editor of the \"Washington Free Beacon,\" Julie Pace, Washington Bureau Chief for the Associated Press, and Jason Riley, \"Wall Street Journal\" columnist and senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute. Julie, you're at the White House, pay attention to all that stuff day-to-day, quite a turnaround, and obviously the situation in Florida changed the dynamic completely. JULIE PACE, WASHINGTON BUREAU CHIEF, ASSOCIATED PRESS: Absolutely. I think this is the president bending to reality here and really recognizing that, whether he likes it or not, this is an election that is very much going to be decided on how Americans view his handling of the pandemic. And he can't wish it away. He is the commander-in-chief and he is ultimately responsible for the health and safety of Americans. And so there was this huge contradiction between him planning to move forward with a big convention, with hundreds of people, thousands of people jammed into a space, and then his administration advising Americans to avoid those exact kind of situations. And so I think ultimately it just became untenable for him to move forward with a traditional convention. BAIER: Matthew, the White House chief of staff, Mark Meadows, saying that it's a very tough decision for a politician. Obviously, it's a launching point for the campaign. But he said it was an easy decision that happened quickly for President Trump when he faced the dangers of what Jacksonville may look like. MATTHEW CONTINETTI, EDITOR IN CHIEF, \"WASHINGTON FREE BEACON\": Look, I think it was a concession to reality. I also think it's a signal of Trump's new tone that he's trying to communicate that he's taking the virus seriously. It also frees him up, I think, to give a more creative address to the nation. But it also says to me, Bret, that this election will really depend more so than usual on the debates. Those will really be one or three instances where we have both candidates in a traditional setting up against each other. The conventions don't matter as much, there's no campaign trail rallies. It will come down, I think, to the debates. BAIER: Jason, take a listen to the Senate minority leader and the Senate minority leader on these negotiations about the next stimulus bill. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY): Even after all this time, it appears the Republican legislative response to COVID is ununified, unserious, unsatisfactory. MCCONNELL: Our proposal will not waste the American people's time with go- nowhere socialist fantasies. We aren't choreographing political stunts or teeing up the same old partisan trench warfare. Our proposal will focus on three things -- kids, jobs, and health care. (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: Senator McConnell saying they will have a framework of a bill. And you heard the White House chief of staff saying there is disagreement within the GOP, and they are giving Democrats the opportunity to hammer them on this issue at least in the short term. JASON RILEY, \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\" COLUMNIST: Yes, that's what we're hearing, Bret. I think that the Republicans have this right. We've had the previous stimulus packages. I think they can only do so much. There's going to be diminishing returns in terms of what the government is trying to do. We've got to get people back to work, and we can't disincentivize them to get back to work. We also have to get kids back to school in order for people to go back to work. Those two things cannot be divorced from one another. So I would like to see a bill that acknowledges that we do need to get this economy up and running again, and puts safety first, obviously, but also weigh the health costs and the financial costs of this lockdown. BAIER: Julie, A.P. poll on school reopening K through 12 schools, open as usual, eight percent, minor adjustments, 14 percent, major adjustments 46 percent. A lot of focus today on the open as usual being only eight percent, but if you add it all up, you're at 68 percent that want it open somehow, schools. So this is going to be a big issue. PACE: It absolutely is. The majority, as you cite in our poll there, wants schools to open. But most people do want to see some kind of adjustments. And I think that's where the struggle is very real for a lot of school districts and a lot of parents. What are those adjustments? What is feasible? What allows you to send a child back in a way that allows them to both be safe and have a productive learning atmosphere right now. And I think the reality that we're seeing from a lot of major school districts in a lot of parts of the country is that they just don't think that they can get there and make those kinds of decisions in the next couple of weeks. And so they are trying to put this decision off until probably the beginning of 2021, which leaves a lot of people in a really tough spot, certainly, for the next couple months. BAIER: I know, in limbo. It's tough. Matthew, very quickly, you think these tighter news conferences, these briefings are helping the president? CONTINETTI: Well, I hope we'll see that emerge in the polls, Bret. But the key is right now, Trump is not running against Biden. He's running against the coronavirus. And in order to win in November, he has to lead on the coronavirus. BAIER: All right, panel, as always, thank you. When we come back, the brighter side of things, some good news. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BAIER: Finally tonight, a pair of special surprises. Joanna Lauby thought she was doing a photo shoot with her two-year-old daughter Annelise. Little did she know her husband Nate turned it into a surprise reunion. Nate's an Army Reserve staff sergeant. He's been deployed overseas since July. Came home early. That's a happy day. When Cameron Andrade returned home after a seven-month deployment with the U.S. Navy, his wife was not the only one happy to see him. Check this out. Cameron's dog Brody could not contain his excitement outside their home in Connecticut. That dog knew. He wagged his tail, ran around furiously. Welcome home Cameron and Nate, thank you for your service. Thanks for inviting us into your home tonight. That's it for this SPECIAL REPORT.

This is \"The Ingraham Angle\" from Washington tonight. The administration orders up a million doses of a potential vaccine. What you need to know about the promise and the pitfalls, and CNN's bizarre anti-hydroxy obsession called out by one of the nation's top epidemiologist. Dr. Harvey Risch is back tonight to respond.Also, the Wall of Moms in Portland; doesn't it sound so sweet? Almost nurturing, but what's the truth behind the media's newest heroines? Mollie Hemingway and Lara Logan reveal.And Biden and Obama are reunited, oh, and it felt so good. You know the song. Well, we're going to tell you why it's necessary. Raymond Arroyo brings us revelations in Seen and Unseen.But first, Joe's care package. That's the focus of tonight's Angle.Tonight, we're about 15 weeks out from the 2020 election, if you can believe it. And the last few days have revealed the candidates' starkly different approaches to leadership. Now, each one has tried to improve his standing on the economy and/or COVID.Now, when Biden though emerges from his comfy basement, he often is just shuffling upstairs to a camera near his French doors with a bucolic scene framing the shot. Yesterday, he tried to show us that he'd be more hands-on regarding the pandemic, offering never before heard solutions like appoint a commanding COVID officer or he'd help small businesses.Oh wait, didn't Trump already do that? Try again, Joe. Well, of course we know, regardless of what he says, the only big thing that poor old Joe would do differently are the lockdowns. In other words, he would mandate a national shelter in place order, which of course would push us toward a socialist cliff and over time, it would end up killing more people than it would save. But of course, he had to start his attempt at relevancy with a shot at the Trump economy.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOE BIDEN, D-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: This man simply doesn't understand. You can't deal with our economic crisis without serving and saving and solving the public health crisis. For all his bluster, about his expertise on the economy, he is unable to explain how he will actually help working families hit the hardest.(END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: I mean, that's laughable. Trump's retort to this is so easy. He kept the economy afloat by signing an unprecedented relief package and his resistance to permanent lockdowns actually helped the economy rebound faster than any of the so-called experts could ever have imagined.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We want to go back to work as opposed to be sort of forced into a position where they're making more money than they expected to make, and the employers are having a hard time getting them back to work. We were very generous with them. I think that it's been a tremendously successful program. We're in a pandemic and yet we're producing tremendous number of jobs. That was something that nobody thought possible.(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM: He's right about that. And beyond the generous checks, and to American workers, more generous than I might have liked, but we are already seeing a recovery; 4.8 million jobs added in June after 2.7 million added in May. So could a Biden economy ever approach that in the middle of a pandemic? Of course not. Because, with no credible plan to create jobs, Biden could only use the Empathizer in Chief approach, while trash-talking school reopening plans.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BIDEN: If you had to put your career on hold indefinitely or senior hours cut or your job lost, the confusion over school reopening only makes things worse.(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM: The confusion over school reopenings? The President has been incredibly consistent on this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: I think they should open the schools, absolutely. I don't consider our country coming back if the schools are closed.Open up our schools, open them up.Data shows children have the lowest fatality risk.UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER: And your son and your grandchildren. Are you comfortable? Do you plan to have them back in person in school this way?TRUMP: Yes, I'm comfortable with that.(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM: But Joe Biden's points on this are all union talking points. Basically, Biden wants to unionize childcare and home health care workers. He wants to give the teachers unions a big basically stay-at-home vacation, keep all the kids at home. And with the health care workers and the other workers getting unionized, who gets to foot that bill?(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BIDEN: And how are we going to pay for is by rolling back unproductive tax cuts, while ensuring high income earners pay their tax bills. We invest that. That would add up to $775 billion over 10 years.(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM: Oh that's a lot of unproductive tax cuts, isn't it? And of course by investment, Joe Biden means spending. There's no such thing as a free lunch or free elder care or free childcare, as nice as that sounds.You'll be billed for the cash with crushing new taxes, while he and his cronies create a new government funded series of unions, all captive to the Democrat Party. But don't worry about all the details. After all, Joe doesn't have to because the press is essentially acting as his campaign comms team. Now, while The President himself, he faces these types of inquiries. \u00a0(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Do you plan to do a national strategy to help us schools reopen and reopen safety?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Do you want the American people to judge you on the ballot in November by how you handled this pandemic? \u00a0UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Three Governors today came out with new orders on mask requirements. Is that something you wish all the Governors would do?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Americans are dying. Are you responsible for that?(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM: OK, nice people. By contrast, this was Biden's Q&A session yesterday.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BIDEN: Thank you for listening. I look forward to having your questions at another time, but I'm off to another event. Thank you Senator.(APPLAUSE)(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM: I mean, they don't even bother shouting questions anymore. He just shuffles off, dodders off the stage; \"Bye Joe\". Now time and again, he devolves into bromides, Biden does, with all the originality of a Hallmark card.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BIDEN: President is supposed to care, to lead, to take responsibility, to never give up. That's what Presidents are supposed to do.(END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: It's like one of those corporate posters. While empathy is nice, don't be fooled by the aw-shucks stuff that he's selling. This is all part of a carefully orchestrated masquerade. \"Look at Joe! He's such a sweet old man and he really cares about us.\"(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: This is Joe Biden's empathy which people believe is a real selling point.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We know Biden has empathy but this time around, he connected policy and empathy.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: He understands that empathy is a huge part of his job.JOY REID, CORRESPONDENT, MSNBC: Would you come back? \u00a0BIDEN: I'd be happy to come back. By the way, we were thinking of you as Vice-President, but then you took this job.(LAUGHTER)So, what can we do?(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM: You know he wanted to just lean in for that shoulder rub, but he got confused he was on satellite. Now, this is the kindly face of an administration that's going to ram through crushing regulations, speech codes, new taxes, reparations and radicalism at every turn.Meanwhile, Biden refuses to subject himself to difficult interviews, either because he is incapable of answering tough questions, cognitive decline, or he is afraid that maybe he will reveal the truth that to survive in his party, he has become little more than a puppet of the radical left and BLM.It's a movement that believes the founders were evil, capitalism is evil, the constitution is evil, most Americans are racists, and that's evil; you get my drift. But we are supposed to believe that the only guy is sweet, old Joe Biden who can save us.Are we supposed to believe now that Obama, he wasn't as talented as Joe is now? I mean they were together for eight years. Well, so Barack Obama wasn't really authentic, couldn't get the job done? The most telling moment over the last few days was when Biden invoked his dad.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BIDEN: He used to have a saying. He said, Joey, I don't expect the government to solve my problems, but I sure as hell expect them to understand my problems.(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM: Well, that's complete nonsense. The government's job is to allow you the freedom to solve your own problems and make your own way. Government doesn't understand anything. It's not a person. We have to see the gauzy Biden sympathy routine for what it is. Just because someone claims to care, it doesn't mean they can make our lives better or strengthen our nation. Jimmy Carter cared. Look where that got us.Time and again, we see Biden wear compassion as fashion, but the I-care- stuff is just a veneer to distract from how far left that he's had to move on almost every major issue facing America. And he is even trying to perfect the squad's racial smears.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BIDEN: No sitting President has ever done this, never, never, never. No Republican President has done this. No Democratic President. We have had racists and they have existed and they have tried to get elected President. He's the first one that has.(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM: Number one, that's disgusting. Number two, it's false and defamatory. Trump shouldn't tolerate this and he should continue to appeal the black voters about the outright lies they are being told in order to hold them back. And number three, it's all very ironic, given Biden's own checkered history on racial rhetoric and his abysmal policy failures. President Trump's slapped back today.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: We passed Criminal Justice Reform, something that Obama and Biden were unable to do. We did opportunity cities. We had the best African American, Hispanic American, Asian American, almost every group was the best for unemployment.(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM: That's what I call caring, results. And you know what real compassion looks like? Offering crime fighting assistance to the most crime ravaged communities in America, where law abiding Americans, many of them black, suffer due to unprosecuted drug and gang violence.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: Today I'm announcing a surge of federal law enforcement into American communities plagued by violent crime.CHARRON POWELL, MOTHER OF LEGEND TALIFERRO: Operation Legend is not to harass. It's not to harm or to hurt. It is to help investigate unsolved murders, in which one of those happens to be our innocent four year-old son. We have to take a stand in our communities and speak up to help this operation.(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM: Everyone should watch that Operation Legend event today. I'll tweet it out later. You'll be better for watching it. Biden is engaged in a high stakes shell game, stoke enough fear in the public about the virus or racism and maybe no one will notice that he's a doddering fool who can't control the mob on the streets or the mob in his own party. This is one care package that will blow up our future if we let it, and that's THE ANGLE.Joining me now is Dr. Ramin Oskoui, CEO of Foxhall Cardiology. We're going to move on a lot of different topics today beyond politics. The big news was the announcement, Dr. Oskoui, that the administration is ordering up to 100 million doses of potential vaccines from Pfizer. That's hopeful news for sure, but any reservations about the speed of it?DR. RAMIN OSKOUI, CEO, FOXHALL CARDIOLOGY: Well, we've skipped a number of trial steps that we often take with vaccines, a number of the animal trials. They're hoping to have this vaccine available by January. Certainly, that's what the contract says.But this is a new viral platform, the mRNA vaccine platform. And we're not even sure it's going to work, especially since it's not geared to go after innate immunity. It's simply an antibody response.INGRAHAM: Dr. Birx talked about the antibody aspect of all of this today on Special Report, watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DR. DEBORAH BIRX, CORONAVIRUS RESPONSE COORDINATOR, WHITE HOUSE: The majority of people around the world, once they're infected, they amount an immune response both what we call the antibody response and the cellular response. It's the roadmap for vaccine development. That's the roadmap for monoclonal antibodies for therapeutics. And I think that's what's so encouraging about this virus and our ability to clear it.(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM: Dr. Oskoui, does this paint a different picture than what the media has been saying? And does that take into account the issue of T-cell immunity that you and I, and so many others in the medical cabinet that we put together, have been referring to?OSKOUI: I think it does. And this has important implications for vaccine development. Vaccines like the AstraZeneca that appear to assist T-cell immunity as well as antibody B-cell immunity are probably likely to be a bit more successful than ones that strictly stimulate antibody immunity. So the short answer is, it has huge implications for vaccine development, but also I think our general understanding of herd immunity and how this virus is going to work itself through and how it's been so deadly.INGRAHAM: Dr. Oskoui, an important response from the CDC Director earlier today when he was asked this question.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Would you be comfortable with your school-aged grandchildren going back to school in the fall?DR. ROBERT REDFIELD, DIRECTOR, CDC: Absolutely. Absolutely.(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM: This is just a purely political calculation these schools are making across the country. Scientific research about kids in school, 2006 Hong Kong's study about the SARS outbreak warned about the adverse psychosocial impact on children. So why is this pro-science party ignoring the science, Dr. Oskoui? \u00a0OSKOUI: You know that's a good question. We locked down this country and never thought of the ramifications in terms of undiagnosed cancers and other issues and the effect on the economy. I think the same thing is true for not having in-person schooling. It's critical that these kids go to school five days a week. They're at low risk and without it, there are going to be clearly, and we have seen this scientifically shown with the SARS epidemic, clearly implications for severe social distancing of children and not having in-person schools. \u00a0INGRAHAM: Dr. Oskoui, as always, we really appreciate your insight tonight.OSKOUI: Thank you.INGRAHAM: And I want to move now to this exchange that made a lot of waves on CNN between the Trump Campaign's Communications Director Tim Murtaugh and CNN host, Brianna Keilar. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TIM MURTAUGH, DIRECTOR, TRUMP CAMPAIGN COMMUNICATIONS: Do you remember the hydroxychloroquine fiasco where the entirety of the media was dead set against anyone ever talking about this simply because The President expressed optimism?(CROSSTALK)BRIANNA KEILAR, HOST, CNN: That's not right because it kills people. We are doing a real disservice to Americans. I just want to be clear to everyone out there. We've talked to a number of doctors and experts, including federal experts. This is not something that you want to be playing with. Alright. Studies have been canceled because this stuff is so dangerous. We are done with this conversation.(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM: Joining me now is an epidemiologist, Dr. Harvey Risch, Professor of Epidemiology at Yale School of Public Health. Dr. Risch, who is really doing the disservice to the American people? Doctors with decades of experience like yourself or the treating physicians on COVID, or CNN hosts who think that hydroxy is so dangerous that we shouldn't even talk about it?DR. HARVEY RISCH, PROFESSOR OF EPIDEMIOLOGY, YALE SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH: Good evening, Laura. That's a little funny that we shouldn't talk about anything. This is a drug that's been used for 65-plus years in billions of doses around the world that people take without even thinking about it. And suddenly it's become dangerous; that's ludicrous.INGRAHAM: The idea that has been floated by yours truly and a few others of giving hydroxychloroquine to those essential workers who want it before they go back to work and a prophylactic dose Dr. Risch, we have some favorable studies on prophylactic use of the drug. What about that? To give people a peace of mind, and where is the FDA on revoking its emergency warning about hydroxy?RISCH: So those are two questions. The first one, there is evidence to show that prophylactic use is at lower doses than treating doses are still beneficial. It's not as strong as the evidence for successful treatment with the drug but still there is evidence for that. One shouldn't be overly confident by taking prophylactic doses that you won't get it, it's still possible, but there is still the possibility of treatments regardless.As to the FDA, I'm hoping that the FDA will in fact change its mind. It will re-evaluate all the evidence that it has and update the evidence and see that there is room for changing its position.INGRAHAM: Now, it's just amazing that we have CNN anchors out there proclaiming on this drug as if they reviewed all the peer-reviewed studies on this. It does such a disservice to people and this has been going on for months and I haven't dropped it because I actually know the science on this, I think pretty well at this point. Dr. Risch, this is what Dr. Fauci said today about the end of the pandemic.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) \u00a0DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, CORONAVIRUS TASK FORCE MEMBER, WHITE HOUSE: I don't see this disappearing the way SARS1 did. The reason I say that is that it is so efficient in its ability to transmit from human to human, that I think we ultimately will get control of it. I don't really see us eradicating it.(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM: Dr. Risch, your reaction to that, is this why therapeutics are so much more important in the short term?RISCH: Well, in the short term, yes. I think that it's hard to predict its ultimate sequence - events, but it's possible that it may circulate like influenza where it's seasonal, eventually that it's better in the Southern hemisphere in our winter - in our summer and comes back in our winter. It's hard to know. And I think that once we have a handle on treatment, then it won't matter so much because the treatment is so very effective.INGRAHAM: Dr. Risch, thank you as always. Great to see you tonight.RISCH: Pleasure.INGRAHAM: And a new media hero has emerged from the smoking rubble of the Pacific Northwest, the Portland Moms. Oh yes. The media loves these folks but wait until you see what we caught them on tape doing. Mollie Hemingway, Lara Logan reacts as I put back my earring on in moments.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. EARL BLUMENAUER, D-ORE.: Portland, Oregon is not out of control but there are some people who have strong feelings.REP. SUZANNE BONAMICI, D-ORE.: They are not welcome to bring these federal officials into our community because they are making things worse and they are hurting people. \u00a0TED WHEELER, MAYOR AND POLICE COMMISSIONER, PORTLAND: Their presence here is actually leading to more violence and more vandalism. They are not wanted here.(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM: It isn't just local officials who are working overtime to downplay the lawlessness and violence plaguing the streets of Portland. The media, well they are joining in and they have a new group of heroes.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: They're calling themselves the Wall of Moms.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: These are the moms that have come out to support this cause.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: A group of moms who've come out there to kind of protect these people.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Dozens of women having formed themselves into a human shield to try to protect the crowd from the federal agents. Moms are here, \"leave our kids alone.\"(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM: This is like (inaudible) unbelievable propaganda. As you see in this video, that same Wall of Moms were part of a group actually seen trying to kick their way into the Federal Courthouse. Joining me now, Lara Logan, host of Lara Logan Has No Agenda on Fox Nation and Mollie Hemingway, Senior Editor at The Federalist, Fox News contributor. Mollie, the Portland moms, OK. This, this really took the cake. It's kind of a microcosm of the media's coverage from Portland and other cities; pay no attention. Everything's peaceful, happy, and even homespun.MOLLIE HEMINGWAY, SENIOR EDITOR, THE FEDERALIST: Well, you see the way that the protesters will say when they see someone filming them to put their cameras down. They don't want the violence to be shown to people. And that's understandable because they know the violence is at odds with their own agenda. That you see so many other people like in the media going along with that is very disturbing.And likewise, this approach of taking your most sympathetic members and putting them as the face of what's going on, this is very common tactic in paramilitary organizations to do that, hide your weaponry in schools or hospitals and whatnot. But again to see the media going along with that and doing these puff pieces is very disturbing.INGRAHAM: Now, Lara, I want to play for you, one BLM protester was caught on tape actually saying; watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Hi everyone. As many of you know, my name is Lilith Sinclair. I am an Afro-Indigenous non-binary local organizer here at Portland, organizing for the abolition of not just the militarized police state but also the United States as we know it.(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM: This is the goal of more of these folks and the media of course, whatever let on. Is that not the case, Lara?LARA LOGAN, HOST, FOX NATION: Well, you know, Laura, I take their word for it, right? Because this woman is not the only one to say that. They say it every single day, all over the internet on thousands of sites. They also have sprayed it all over the walls of the cities where there have been riots, all Democrat controlled cities, by the way. And I say that because it's very significant that these riots are taking place in areas that are where the Democrats can control the messaging.Why? Because when you bring in federal agents, you upset all of that. Now, you don't just have local district attorneys. You're bringing in Assistant U.S. attorneys are coming with those federal agents. The people on the ground who are committing crimes, they can't just be released from prison because now they're being charged with federal crimes. They're facing much more significant charges and longer sentences, and it's also showing how effective local law enforcement and federal law enforcement can be when working together.All of which is outside the control of city officials who --I've been talking to people on the ground in some of these places. And they're just saying that they're tired of being ignored, that there's a group of radicals and a small group who have taken over the city councils, who've taken over the messaging and who are out there on the streets. And they don't represent everyone in these cities.It's not true that everyone in Portland feels this way. But the media isn't even talking to these people and what you're talking about with the moms, this is why I love Mollie, right? Because she's so right. These are deception tactics. They're being used. This is an information war. And they have been trying to say that federal authorities are being misused or overused, painting The President in their strategic messaging as some kind of dictator. And that's because they don't want this tactic being used because it's effective.INGRAHAM: Yes. Let me jump on what you just said there because the rioters are portrayed as the new freedom writers. They're not writers; they're freedom writers. And then the police, any law enforcement, especially federal law enforcement are being demonized including by Joy Reid. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REID: He's using that Trumped up charge to justify what in any other country, particularly authoritarian one, would be called the secret police.Need to have his secret police.There's a secret police aspect of it.These federal secret police.The deploying of secret police.It's a secret police sort to vibe.Using his own secret police.(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM: The former attorney general there, that's just embarrassing. Mollie, secret police that happen to have clearly marked uniforms that are protecting federal property. Boy, the tables are turned here.MOLLIE HEMINGWAY, SENIOR EDITOR, \"THE FEDERALIST\": It's not just that they are clearly marked as police or that they have identifying badges on them. But also, when people are attacking federal courthouses, that is a federal concern. When they are going after federal personnel as they did the Lafayette Park in Washington, D.C., that's a federal concern. And there is actually an obligation to restore law and order. The entire country benefits from how cases are handled at the Mark O. Hatfield Courthouse in downtown Portland, not just the few citizens of Portland.And so even if the Portland mayor wants to allow mobs to control his city, it still is of concern to the rest of the country. And ideally, cities would be handling these issues better on their own and there would be no need for any federal law enforcement agents to have to risk their lives because the mob has gotten out of control. But when cities don't handle their own business and states don't handle their own business, there is a role for the federal government to play, and in fact, not just a role, but an obligation.INGRAHAM: Lara, I was going to play something else from MSNBC.LARA LOGAN, FOX NATION HOST: And Laura, can I get in there?INGRAHAM: Yes, go ahead.LOGAN: I just want to jump in there and say something, because I was on the border with BORTAC and BORSTAR, I was out with these forces. These are highly trained forces. They know exactly what they are doing. They are special operations level inside the Border Patrol. When they're deployed like this, they have markings. They have \"Police\" on the front of their vests, they have it on the back. On both of their arms they have both the Border Patrol patches and the BORTAC patches.And just because local officials and journalists and idiots on the streets there who are rioting, they can't look up what that patch means and they don't know who these people are, doesn't mean that they haven't been identified. And it's very significant that people are lying about this. That is just astonishing to me.INGRAHAM: They know exactly what they're doing. They're not mistaking it. They know it's a lie. That's the real problem here. And by the way, we found out yesterday that at least one of the injured officers may not recover the sight in his eyes because he was hit repeatedly. So the real ramifications, physical safety, physical health and well-being, on top of all of the demonization that's going on here. Ladies, phenomenal analysis, as always. Thank you so much.And coming up, the boys are back in town. Obama, Biden together again. We're going to explain why.And a political loser is being resurrected in a new streaming series? Answers, and Biden's blunders, Raymond Arroyo has it all, \"Seen and Unseen\" next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)INGRAHAM: Welcome to our \"Seen and Unseen\" segment where we expose the stories behind the headlines. A big political reunion was hyped today. For details we're joined by Raymond Arroyo, FOX News contributor.Raymond, Biden and Obama are reuniting, and it feels so good. What is this?RAYMOND ARROYO, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, the Biden campaign, Laura, released a trailer to promote the forthcoming conversation between the political team. It's staged to look like a Netflix special, Laura. They exit from their cars with entourages. They synchronize their elevator exits. Obama even does his trademark bow. And their conversation is played like a streaming event. In a released clip, Obama reveals more than perhaps he intended. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BARACK OBAMA, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT: You are going to be able to reassemble the kind of government that cares about people and brings people together.(END VIDEO CLIP)ARROYO: Reassemble the old Obama team, Laura. Susan Rice, Eric Holder, John Kerry, they're all coming back, you know it.INGRAHAM: They're clearly trotting out Obama because Biden is in trouble, and Obama is the biggest fundraiser the Democrats have. There is no enthusiasm for Biden.ARROYO: No. And it also may have something to do with his poll numbers among black voters. Hillary won 89 percent of the black vote, Laura. According to the latest Zogby poll, only 77 percent of black voters support Biden right now. So he needs Obama to make up that difference and more.Also, the Obama/Biden meet up may be a smokescreen, Laura, to hide the fact that today it was revealed the Biden and Sanders camps have submitted proposals to update the Democratic Party platform. They want to decrease spending on national defense, emphasize police brutality and climate change, propose an end to forever wars -- I thought Trump did that -- and a national proposal to study slave reparations. If that was your agenda, you'd be sitting across from Obama too, Laura.INGRAHAM: First of all, why didn't Obama get all this done in eight years? Was he inadequate? Was he in authentic? So are we supposed to believe that Biden is a smarter political operator then Obama was for eight years, or that Biden was hiding all the solutions from Obama for eight years? He just had the solutions but he was hiding them from him?ARROYO: Well, the visual evidence tells a different story. Biden held a virtual event today with union health care workers, Laura, including a nurse with whom he shared his personal health story.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOE BIDEN, D-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I've been a significant recipient of care. I was hospitalized for a while long time with an aneurysm.What kind of questions did they ask?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: They asked how long was this be going on, when are we going to be able to see our families, when is he going to open up the economy?BIDEN: Do you have any mental health workers at the facility that are able to, we you need that extra help with the patients?(END VIDEO CLIP)ARROYO: For a moment, Laura, I thought he was going to ask Nurse Ann Ryan to find him a bed in her unit. Did you notice she said her patients are hoping Trump will open up the economy? That was probably unrehearsed and unexpected.INGRAHAM: What was that sound? It almost sounded like a coffin was opening at the beginning of the segment.(LAUGHTER)INGRAHAM: I thought someone was coming into the studio here for a moment. What the heck was that?ARROYO: I don't know.INGRAHAM: There were a lot of Biden gaffes, technical and otherwise.ARROYO: Yes, there were.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BIDEN: I'm confused who I'm talking to here, but anyway, whoever it is.Nurses at Walter Reed hospital who would bend down and whisper in my ear, go home and get me pillows. They'd actually breathe in my nostrils to make me move, to get me moving.(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM: What?ARROYO: My Lord, Laura. You can see why a grand total of 26 people watched this event. That was the high point. And incidentally, two of those viewers were myself and one of your producers. That shows you the great groundswell for this event.INGRAHAM: Wait a second, I'm still trying to get over the nurse was breathing into his nostrils?ARROYO: Breathing into his nostrils. This is very odd.INGRAHAM: It's like God breathing into Adam, breathe life into him. What was that?By the way, the comments from nurses who watched that clip, I think Tom Elliott tweeted out, the nurses, I have been nursing for 40 years, I've never breathed into someone's nostrils. What was that? I don't understand that one.ARROYO: Laura, these dry bones could use a little holy spirit power. So we'll be looking for that next. And we're going to rollover. We'll do this special Hulu series when I next join you.INGRAHAM: OK, Raymond, thanks so much.And coming up, we're seeing an alarming trend of China apologists among the most powerful politicians and so-called experts in the U.S. I'm going to call them out and name names in moments. Plus, a U.S. college kicked a Chinese-American students off campus because he commemorated the Tiananmen Square massacre. That student is here next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)INGRAHAM: Something I said for almost 20 years on radio is now finally becoming a consensus view. A lot of this is because of Donald Trump. China and the CCP represent the greatest geopolitical threat to this nation. Our leaders know this, or at least they should. Yet we see example after example of politicians, finance execs, and foreign relations experts acting as surrogates basically for the CCP.Now, take the issue of the coronavirus. The global pandemic spread like wildfire because China refused to sound the alarm, choosing instead to cover up its failures. Now despite this undeniable truth, the speaker of the House is looking to score cheap political points.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. NANCY PELOSI, D-CALIF., HOUSE SPEAKER: A good deal of what we have suffered is clearly the Trump virus.(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM: The CCP thanks you for that propaganda, Madam Speaker. You're hired.Her caucus, of course, take their cues from their own dear leader. Here is Congressman Adam Smith of Washington.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. ADAM SMITH, D-WA.: It's not actually their job to warn the American people. It's the president's job to warn the American people.(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM: To be clear, the Democrat speaker of the House and the Democrat chairman of the Armed Services Committee think it's OK for China to hide information from us. We still haven't gotten all the facts from China that led to the deaths of tens of thousands of Americans. They're going to look the other way as long as they can try to ultimately hurt Donald Trump in an election year. Got it. Nice.While our elected leaders sell us out on China, some of the sages in the international relations community want us to now work more closely with the Chinese communists.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We can't blame China for our own mistakes, for our own policies which have often been inadequate. The United States should not be against China's rise. It should be the goal diplomatically to maintain or preserve or even create areas of cooperation.(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM: What do you think the trade deal was, Richard? I should note that commentary from Mr. Haass was made on CGTM, a network funded by the Chinese government.Meanwhile, the Trump administration was busy busting the CCP for a massive spying ring right here on U.S. soil at the China Houston consulate. Just hours after the State Department ordered that consulate to close down, employees there began burning paperwork in an obvious attempt to hide their efforts.So how do those apologists for China feel now? Remember their names. Remember the words of appeasement toward our greatest foe.And it's not just the leftist politicians, but our university system that's seemingly bowing down to the communist regime. My next guest, a rising senior at Fordham University, claims he is banned now from campus over this Instagram post commemorating the horrific Tiananmen Square massacre. Documents Tong provided to \"The Ingraham Angle\" reveal Fordham claims the posts violated university policy not to threaten or intimidate.Austin Tong joins me now. Austin, the gun is legally owned and you were merely appreciating the Chinese democratic movement. So why would a U.S. university have an issue with this?AUSTIN TONG, FORDHAM UNIVERSITY STUDENT: Hi, Laura. So I think that they would have an issue with anything they disagree with, and they want to silence any voice they don't like. And that is really what happened. And they silenced me because they don't like what I said. And I will not back down to that.INGRAHAM: Austin, you wouldn't be able to say, of course, what you are saying now in China, but I bet you didn't think after coming to the United States and living here, your family, that the long arm of China would reach into the United States with all these kids and scholars from China who have studied here for years and years, and the university is protecting the right to be here and stay here, many of them handpicked by the CCP. But they slap you down and actually ban you from campus?TONG: Supposedly, we have the First Amendment here. We have the Constitution, but that's not what Fordham University thinks. That's not what the bad people, as I call them, the bad people think. And that's why we have to fight back.Look, I'm not going to say sorry. I'm not going to back down. This is not just my case. They took my life away, OK? They put my future into a very bad place. And that's I'm going to bet all my future into this. We'll be fighting hard. I'm going to be suing them very soon. And we're going to be fighting for people across the country. People from across the country came to me, OK, friends and family. We have the NRA, students, the campus reform, media and Instagrammers, we are forming a new movement against this, because no more can we be silenced by the institutions that overpower us. We will let them know there is consequence to this.INGRAHAM: The Justice Department needs to get involved, frankly. These are civil rights that are being summarily -- students being deprived of their civil rights, their free speech. Fordham said that you violated its policy on bias. But listen to an associate professor there, Christina Greer.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CHRISTINA GREER, FORDHAM UNIVERSITY PROFESSOR: Donald Trump has been abysmal for American democracy and is actually poisoning a lot of the soil in America. He's a few months away from just screaming white power. And so he continues with more white nationalist, more white supremacist message day by day.(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM: So I guess, Austin, you can violate their policy, but professors can't?TONG: I think she just said to you that Mr. Trump, after one year, he went to the school. The school right now is a total disaster what they did, it's shameful. And we'll make sure people know about that.INGRAHAM: Keep fighting, Austin. Austin, keep fighting. We're going to following this. We'll have you back. Unbelievable, Fordham University, shame on you.Up next Bill Gates has the inside scoop about your kids going back to school. The Last Bite, next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BILL GATES, CO-FOUNDER, MICROSOFT CORPORATION: If you're in a hot spot, sadly, in this fall, it won't be normal school activities for most high schools and colleges. By fall, 2021, which is a long time from now, I think we'll have things under control enough. But the entire academic year, this next academic year, does hang in the balance.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM: Oh, you hear that? Because it's easy to say when you have tens of billions of dollars. It's not so easy when you need to pull double shifts and rely on public school for your kids.It's all the time we have tonight.

I'm Jesse Watters along with Juan Williams, Greg Gutfeld, Kennedy, and Emily Compagno. It's 5 o'clock in New York City and this is The Five. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: If they are Democrat run cities, they are liberally run, they are stupidly run. CHRIS WALLACE, FOX NEWS HOST: Liberal Democrats have been running cities in this country for decades. TRUMP: Poorly. WALLACE: Why is it so bad right now? TRUMP: They have run them poorly. It was always bad but now it's totally out of control. (END VIDEO CLIP) WATTERS: President Trump attacking Democrats in an interview with Chris Wallace that will air on Fox News Sunday. It comes as his administration in America's biggest cities take very different approaches to a surge in violence. Federal agents cracking down on protesters in Portland after the 50th night of demonstrations. Anarchists were threatening to burn down a police precinct before the cops stepped in. Oregon's Democrat governor called the move political theater. But acting DHS Chief Chad Wolf is calling her out for letting anarchy run wild. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CHAD WOLF, ACTING SECRETARY, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY: We continue to see violent activity, violent anarchists' night after night targeting those facilities. I think the concern that I have, or the local leadership, local and state leadership, they are fostering an environment where it's very difficult for law enforcement to do their job. And they are not coming out, in my view, in my opinion, coming out strong and of condemning the violent activity there in Portland. (END VIDEO CLIP) WATTERS: Meanwhile in New York, the police are under attack and their assailants are being set free. The men who punch an NYPD chief on the Brooklyn Bridge was released without bail. And with shootings up 277 percent from last year, Mayor Bill de Blasio now unveiling an end gun violence plan but only after bragging the city is safer than ever. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MAYOR BILL DE BLASIO (D-NY), NEW YORK CITY: We now have fewer people in our jails than any time since World War II. And we are safer for it and better for it. (END VIDEO CLIP) WATTERS: I don't know if I agree with that logic. But Juan, why don't liberal mayors just drop the hammer? JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS HOST: Drop the hammer on who, Jesse? People who are exercising their first amendment constitutional rights to protest police brutality? WATTERS: No, the anarchists, Juan. WILLIAMS: You know, look. WATTERS: And the violent criminals and the vandals and the rioters. WILLIAMS: I think that Jesse -- Jesse -- Jesse, there are people who have engaged in unlawful activity that you've just described. They should be arrested. They are not, they are not even close to anywhere near the heart and soul of people who are concerned about standing up for racial justice in the country. (CROSSTALK) WATTERS: So why don't the mayors tell the police chiefs to separate out the bad guys and let the peaceful demonstrations go on? WILLIAMS: Of course, they do. (CROSSTALK) WATTERS: They're not doing that. WILLIAMS: That in fact, that's the situation on the bridge there in New York, it was a situation where church leaders had a separate march and then you had some of those vandals intervened and the police went after the vandals. No one is arguing that. But I just wanted to say to you I think the president here is playing on fear, anxiety, and emotion about the idea of peaceful marches, saying that there is police brutality in the country. And I can't deny anyone's fear or anxiety over what's going on in the country but I can say that if there's hard data, hard data that says there is no anarchy in our streets, the crime is relatively low in our streets at this time. And I think my real fear is the situation in Portland, because you have federal agents dressed in camouflage jumping out of unmarked cars, grabbing people, throwing them in jail, telling them they are under arrest then releasing them. That's a clear violation of who we are as a country. That sounds like some authoritarian state. Senator Ron Wyden said the president wants these confrontations because they play well in right-wing media and they divide the country. Governor Kate Brown said it's an abuse of federal power. All the mayors involved say we don't need federal agents in unmarked uniforms acting like some kind of authoritarian police. WATTERS: Well, those uniforms were marked. And if you look at the video you could see were the markings were on the shoulders, Juan. And if some people are breaking windows in a federal building and spray painting them, then I think the government can come in federally and clean it up. Greg, do you agree with Juan that is just a bunch of fear and there's really nothing to worry about? GREG GUTFELD, FOX NEWS HOST: The fear is legitimate and anybody who's been personally experiencing what's been going on in the streets know this and I won't even address it anymore. Because this justification is so old and stale. If there is no hard data. What about the spectacular increase in shootings and deaths? They actually dismantle the anti-crime unit in charge of getting illegal guns off the streets in New York and the shootings doubled. And you know who asked for the anti-crime unit back? The black leaders in New York City. Thank God they are asking for it to come back. So, if you actually believe that there is no hard data then you're basically living in a bubble. And there's -- I have to give them credit, though, the left are doing a great thing. They've created crime and chaos so that when Trump intervenes, he'll be painted as an autocrat. So, if you do anything about it, you're a tyrant. But if you do nothing, the crime surge goes unabated and so the citizens suffer, and the left would much rather have the citizens suffer than actually let Trump do the right thing because they hate him so much. But I have to hand it to America for being so dam patient. Basically there's 300 plus million people getting by in life while these miscreants are destroying the country. It reminds me of that scene from \"Witness\" where Harrison Ford is in the buggy and that jackass starts harassing him and putting ice cream on his face until finally Harrison Ford gets up and beats the crap out of him. We are heading in a direction where law-abiding citizens are going to have enough of this. Until we cooperate, and I mean the protesters and the police get together because it's destroying the protest movement. It's destroying the movement and it's going to reelect Trump. So, you better stop playing these dumb games and admit there's a problem. WATTERS: Yes. Even the fake Amish (ph) sometimes have to take matters into their own hands. GUTFELD: So true. WATTERS: Emily Compagno, when you look at some of these mayors, I guess in Portland or in Seattle, in Chicago, in New York City, wouldn't you think may be that they would not want to go down in the history books as just dangerous radicals that let anarchists take over their towns? EMILY COMPAGNO, FOX NEWS HOST: You would think, but unfortunately, that's exactly how they are going to go down in the history books. I have had the benefit of four decades living on the west coast and I'll tell you guys about how I see these Democratic mayors and leaders are emboldening these destructive violent protesters and also single-handedly making their cities fall into rot and disrepair. So, of these top ten most dangerous cities in the United States according to Forbes, not according to right-wing media, all of them are led by Democratic mayors. Of the top 10 highest instances of homelessness in cities, those are all led by Democratic mayors too and they are all sanctuary cities. So that means they refused to cooperate with federal law enforcement. Of the top 25 most dangerous cities, most are Democratic led and the poverty rates is up to three times that of the national average. So is unemployment. These are the statistics that don't lie, and when you're living there as a resident and you are seeing your incompetent, ineffective mayor refused to support law enforcement, refused to take a zero stance on violence and destruction while also acknowledging what needs to change and how, I don't understand why that's so difficult. But as a resident, you watch it helplessly as your law enforcement is attacked, is bloodied on air, is killed, and your cities being destroyed as companies are fleeing because they are getting no tax incentives as your taxes or raisings you can pay for the hazmat cleanup for the ICE building being occupied for five weeks and I could go on. But believe me, there plenty of statistics to back up why Democratic led cities are rotting. WATTERS: Kennedy, I'll give you the last word. KENNEDY MONTGOMERY, FOX NEWS HOST: Well, Juan is absolutely right. And Ron Wyden is right here that these images do help the president. And Kate Brown and Ted Wheeler, Ted Wheeler is the mayor of Portland. Kate Brown is the governor of Oregon. It is a total abdication of leadership on their part. And when you are hamstringing the police department because you have been neutered with the razor of wokeness, you are creating this environment that only grows and grows and limits people's freedom to associate and freedom to move throughout one of the most formerly livable cities in the world. I grew up in Portland. This is not the city that I know and love. And the fact that they have given over to this mob because they somehow want to be liked, that's not why you run for office. That's not why you become mayor. There has to be leadership here. And there is utter hypocrisy. You see it from coast-to-coast and that's why for the first time when I talk to people in New York and California, they are talking about moving to places like Texas and Tennessee which not only have more favorable tax environments but there's also a greater freedom to be enjoyed here. Because when there is no leadership, people give up at the shrugs and they leave and then the cities finally collapsed. So, you want every city in this country to be like Detroit in 2014? God, I hope not. WATTERS: I think you're right. Coming up, White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany hit with one of the nastiest smears yet. We'll show you next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) MONTGOMERY: Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot attacking Kayleigh McEnany, accusing the White House press secretary of being a Karen, after she called the mayor derelict over the surge of violence in that city. Here's McEnany responding on Watters World that airs this weekend. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KAYLEIGH MCENANY, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: I'm very upset about the violence in the streets of her city. You know, she is focused on words but instead she should be focused on actions. I understand the truth hurts. The president has written her a letter and offered her help, and she needs to take it. (END VIDEO CLIP) MONTGOMERY: And CNN's Jim Acosta getting slammed for taking the press secretary out of context. Acosta claimed McEnany said that the science should not stand in the way of reopening schools but here's what really happened. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MCENANY: The science should not stand in the way of this and as Dr. Scott Atlas said, I thought this was a good quote of course, we can do it, everyone else in the western world our peer nations are doing it. We are the outlier here. The science is on our side here. We encourage for localities and states to just simply follow the science, open our schools. (END VIDEO CLIP) MONTGOMERY: Jesse, tell me a little bit more about that interview with Kayleigh. What else did she say? WATTERS: She mentioned that Jim Acosta is the kind of guy that's a real jerk when the cameras go on and then afterwards, he's the nicest guy in the world. It's like the opposite of me. I'm like so nice on TV but then I'm a jerk in real life. I just keep -- GUTFELD: I doubt. WATTERS: Yes, Gutfeld can vouch. GUTFELD: Yes. WATTERS: Honestly, I think the mayor of Chicago needs to start Karen a little bit more about her people dying because that's the point here. It's funny how a lot of these liberal mayors were begging the president for all this federal aid during the pandemic but then when black on black crime was surging and people's stores were being robbed and fires were burning, they didn't want any of the president's help all of a sudden. I think the memo went out to Democratic mayors that we have to refuse the president's help because the president is getting good press when that happens. So, they'd rather stop the president from getting good press than stopping their own people being killed. It is weird, though, that she says well, if he really wanted to help, he would, you know, make sure people that were on no-fly lists couldn't buy guns or do more background checks or ban assault rifles. Does the mayor of Chicago really think the people squeezing the triggers are on no-fly list or they're buying their guns illegally or they are really using AR-15's instead of handguns? The fact that we buy this line from her without challenging her makes you realize how corrupt this whole media deal is. MONTGOMERY: Well, Juan, it's also, I mean, it's really kind of worthless to just engage in this partisan bickering. And it's really easy for the mayors, you know, the president needs to shut his face because as Kate Brown said too in Oregon. But wouldn't it be a little bit better if some of these mayors actually came up of a list of things that they were doing and that they were going to put in place in the near future to make their city safer? To make people, citizens there feel better? Wouldn't you rather hear that from Lori Lightfoot? WILLIAMS: Look, I think, Kennedy, she's a local official, she's elected by the people of Chicago. She answers to the people of Chicago. And I would imagine they have demands and pressures on her, the council members and the rest, state officials as well in time to protect their citizens. I just don't see it as a federal responsibility. That's not the way our country is structured. We don't run in and tell local officials how to run their schools, how to run their police department unless you want to make it a political issue. And with regard to Kayleigh McEnany, listen, I think that if you're the chief communications officer for the President of the United States, you need to be clear and precise in your language. Everyone knows the president wants schools to reopen this fall. So, she can't start making the case by saying science should not start -- stand in the way before she gets to citing a scientist and citing documents, because guess what, people are going to say, wait, you said science shouldn't stand in the way. And then she says you took me out of context. No, I think she was not clear, she was not precise. (CROSSTALK) MONTGOMERY: Even Jim Acosta's -- WILLIAMS: And people are -- MONTGOMERY: -- coworker Jake Tapper said that he unfairly took her out of context. And by the time he -- (CROSSTALK) WILLIAMS: Correct. I think -- MONTGOMERY: -- by the time he tweeted out a correction, he had already gotten 30,000 likes on that tweet. So, that part of it is dishonest. And there are -- there are teachers -- WILLIAMS: No. MONTGOMERY: There are academics, there are scientists, there are doctors. There are parents, there are kids who wants schools to open, so she's not alone in that. WILLIAMS: Yes. MONTGOMERY: And that is not simply a -- (CROSSTALK) WILLIAMS: No, I'm not saying that. MONTGOMERY: As far as the cities, yes, the cities need to be run by the officials. Unfortunately, a lot of these cities we're talking about are being run into the ground. Greg, let's talk about the most important issue here, though. (CROSSTALK) WILLIAMS: Well, that's up to local officials. GUTFELD: Well, wait a second. Can I, Kennedy -- (CROSSTALK) MONTGOMERY: When local officials are doing a bad job, they should be thrown out of office if they're doing a bad job. Greg, go ahead. GUTFELD: Kennedy, this -- (CROSSTALK) WILLIAMS: That's up to local voters. MONTGOMERY: OK. OK. Very quick. GUTFELD: It's interesting that their bodies piling up, Juan says that's a local issue but when it's a police incident it becomes a national story that involves every single media outlet that causes protests and then later riots and looting. It's a national, it's a global that affects England. But when there are bodies piling up in Chicago, it's a local issue. Mind your own business. Look, we saw -- (CROSSTALK) WILLIAMS: That's not right. GUTFELD: We saw with Acosta. We saw with Acosta that Trump is right. That fake news is the enemy of the people. One of the most powerful statements since tear down this wall and it's really good that we see this in action because every day the public gets more and more red pilled. That is the media that is manipulating the news in order to create dissent so that they can get more clicks. And they don't just do this by the way to public figures like Kayleigh. If you've ever been the subject of a story and you know you weren't treated fairly because there's always an inclination for a reporter to create a sensation out of nothing. You know, a beach --- a beach without a shark attack is just a beach. So, you need that shark attack. But I've got to tell you, finally, it is a joy to watch Kayleigh because it provides a contrast. What you have on one side in the press corps are these whiny, petty dudes, right, compared to the stoic terminator shooting lasers made of facts into their dissident brains is a positive joy for me. It makes my day every day. MONTGOMERY: And then you can make your night tomorrow night by watching not only the Greg Gutfeld show but also -- GUTFELD: Yes. MONTGOMERY: -- Watters World and you can see that exclusive interview with Kayleigh McEnany. But of the most important issue here truly, Emily, is the abuse of the term Karen. Don't take Karen from us, because if you just throw Karen around in the wrong way, we don't get to use it and we don't get to enjoy it and maybe that is the greatest miscarriage of justice. I appeal to you. COMPAGNO: I rule affirmatively on that. Look, I -- I'll speak to Mayor Lightfoot's tweet. The whole watch your mouth or what? Why doesn't she watch her town? The statistics coming out of Chicago are undeniable. Nine children have been shot to death under the age of 18 since June 20th. And she talks about being left alone but the pandemic has exacerbated all of the stressors in those communities that are experiencing the most violence to begin with. Right? Like unemployment spiking and infection rates and death rates. So, for her to focus on this to throw around Karen to basically threaten Kayleigh and then ignore her own town which is rotting and festering, again, I think she should watch her residence. She should watch her children and she should probably listen to those residents who are saying enough is enough. MONTGOMERY: Amen. I feel her -- I feel your frustration and hopefully these leaders will tap into that and they will at some point sprout a pair and lead. Excellent. All right. Coming up next, Joe Biden fully embracing the far left. What he just did and how bad will it hurt him come November. That's next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) WILLIAMS: Welcome back. Joe Biden is leading in the polls but will adopting ideas from progressive cost him in November? Biden who painted himself as more of a moderate during the primaries is now embracing some of the policies from his former Democratic rivals. Axios out today with a report on, quote, \"how Warren is shaping Biden's policies.\" And the Washington Post noting, quote, \"Biden's vision comes into view, and it's much more liberal than it was.\" End quote. Kennedy, the president has tried to define Joe Biden as too close to China, a doddering old man. Too hard on crime in the '90s now he's too soft on crime. Is the problem here that people know Joe Biden and like him? MONTGOMERY: I think that is probably the biggest problem for the president is that he's a likable person and as I've said before he's not Hillary Clinton. And she really activated people to come out and vote against her. It was -- it was unprecedented. Man, was she a bad nominee? Joe Biden, this is interesting because normally when we had towards the general election you see something called triangulation where someone who ran pretty far left as a Democrat now tries to move to the center in order to get those necessary independent voters. What Joe Biden is doing is called strangulation because we've seen the failure of big government over and over and over again on both sides, to be completely fair. And so, what he is offering through the status and socialist policies that Elizabeth Warren and people like AOC and Bernie Sanders have to offer is even more government which means even more problems. And I think that is -- that will cost him points. Will it cost him the election? Maybe not, but it's a really bad way for the former vice president to define himself right now. WILLIAMS: Emily, what about tying Joe Biden to Elizabeth Warren? Do you think that could work for the president? Will people buy it? COMPAGNO: They probably will because Biden is doing it to himself. Now, he bent over backwards to impart that his green economy plan would somehow all go to union jobs, but they're not buying it. Jim Snell, the business agent for the Steamfitters said I am shocked and stunned at the language coming out of Biden's mouth allegedly a union guy. The Democratic Party has kicked the trade unions to the curb. And interestingly, former U.S. Congressman Ryan Costello said that the swing voters in Pennsylvania, they used to be suburban women, and now they will be those building tradesmen. WILLIAMS: All right, Jesse, A lot of the Democratic strategists right now are saying at this point in the campaign, most candidates have already defined their opponent and try to then use it. But I wonder, is it too late at this point in the game. We're about, you know, three to four months away from the vote. WATTERS: It's never too late. Biden is blowing is, Juan. All he had to do is stay in a moderate lane, and he's just gone off the rails to the left. He just needs to stay moderate so he's competitive in battlegrounds. But I think what's happening is his campaign manager, they know the real polls, not the ones really under sample Republicans by 10 points to get like a really bad frame job on the president. The real poll show Biden has a really bad enthusiasm gap with the President. S1o the only thing they think they need to do is juice enthusiasm with the left-wing base to juice turnout. The way they're doing it is go into Bernie and have Bernie call the shots. That's just a really dumb idea because now if you look at the poly see positions that Joe Biden has, he's for taxpayer-funded partial-birth abortion on demand. I mean, he's for sanctuary cities. His health care program covers illegal immigrants. And when you close your eyes in the dark, you can't tell in a blind taste test the difference between Sanders' health care plan, and Joe Biden's. He's raising taxes, he's going to hit everybody with regulations, and he's letting Beto confiscate guns. So, he really screwed this up, Juan. I mean, if I was an advisor, I could tell Joe Biden had to beat Donald Trump. I won't, because I won't. But it's not that difficult if he just stays normal, but he went off the Crazy Train and fell into the socialism trap. WILLIAMS: Hey, Greg, you know, the biggest item these days is the virus obviously. And today the Washington Post is out with numbers that show widespread disapproval in almost every category of voters on the President's handling of the virus. So does that make this just a referendum on Trump and really make defining or smearing Biden not relevant? GUTFELD: Well, it would -- it would mean something if people also had suggestions. Like, say what is -- what is Trump doing wrong and what you could do to make it better. Biden has that -- hasn't done that. In fact, no Democrats have done that. They sit there and they complain, but they don't have any tips on how to do it better. Look, Biden isn't far left, he's far gone. If he thinks demilitarizing the military would placate the left, he'd do it. This guy is so malleable, he makes Gumby look like John Kerry. I think he should -- and I think he should pick Liz Warren. After all, she's a woman of color, she's the first lady astronaut, and she discovered penicillin. She is the greatest woman that ever lived and I think you should pick her. WILLIAMS: Wow, we'll take that is an endorsement. GUTFELD: Yes. WILLIAMS: Kanye West dropping new hints on his 2020 presidential run. More on that in the \"FASTEST SEVEN\" next on THE FIVE. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) COMPAGNO: Welcome back. Time for the \"FASTEST SEVEN.\" First up, Kanye West moving full speed ahead with his 2020 presidential bid tweeting a photo of his face on Mount Rushmore after making his way onto the presidential ballot in Oklahoma. All right, Kennedy, what do you think? Can you see it? MONTGOMERY: Absolutely. I think it's going to be fantastic. And I think -- I think Biden and Trump are both going to drop out of the race. I would love to see Jo Jorgensen really put up a good fight on the libertarian side, but I think Kanye has the edge here. And after that visual, he could bring the country together and really save the nation with that profile. COMPAGNO: Greg, what do you think? GUTFELD: Number one, it's going exactly according to plan. Kanye knows that to win as president, you got to run like three times, right? So, the first time you put your toe in the water, and then the next time you last a little bit longer, and then the next time your name is synonymous with running for president goes hand in hand. I have to criticize you, Kennedy. I don't think whatever her name, Jorgensen, is a real libertarian. I think she's a virtue signaler. KENNEDY: She's got a lot of heat this week, but she has been through the crucible of liberty. And I think there are always bumps in the road for candidates and I think she'll come out victorious in her own realm, which is saying that you'll get two percent of the vote. GUTFELD: Pestilence. COMPAGNO: So, Jesse, what do you think? Is Kanye taking a playbook page from Biden and will he maybe be successful three times from now? WATTERS: Does anybody have any idea what Kennedy and Gutfeld just talked about? I mean, what the hell was that? Anyway -- KENNEDY: Don't tread on me, Watters. WATTERS: OK. I just -- I just think that if Sleepy Joe loses to Donald Trump by a few thousand votes in Wisconsin or Pennsylvania, and it's because thousands of Black Americans wrote in Kanye West in Philly or Milwaukee, it's just going to be so delicious. COMPAGNO: Juan, what do you predict will happen with Kanye's election bid? WILLIAMS: I think he must have a new album coming out Emily. I think this is publicity. He has -- he has no idea what -- you know, about registering to get on the ballot in states and he's missed some already. I just think - - WATTERS: Write them in. WILLIAMS: -- you know, he doesn't understand what it really takes to be president. But I think that what Jesse just said is true. I think that the Trump supporters would love to have somebody -- they think that black folks would all vote for Kanye. I don't think that. I think Kanye has a lot of white fan. WATTERS: Hey, white college students too, Juan. WILLIAMS: That's what I was saying. COMPAGNO: All right, guys, next up, Coronavirus lockdowns make us all want to scream apparently. That was an advertisement from Iceland's Tourism Board encouraging people to submit their screams. The country says it will play them throughout the empty countryside if people can't do it in person. Jesse, your thoughts. WATTERS: I really don't have any thoughts on this. I didn't really know we were going to be doing this topic. Iceland, really? COMPAGNO: You don't need to prepare for this. WATTERS: This would be a great place to quarantine. That's all I have to say about that. COMPAGNO: Kennedy, they -- Iceland went through this awesome tourism marketing campaign that actually really worked about using their airport as a flyover, and then this happened. Do you think this is two steps backward for them? KENNEDY: Yes, I don't think this one is necessary. I like I like Bjork and we'll leave it there. I hear that Iceland is a lovely place to visit. They got a lot of hot springs and stuff. But screaming, it makes me very uncomfortable and nervous. WATTERS: Is Bjork a libertarian, Kennedy. Let's talk about that. KENNEDY: She's actually running for the libertarian nomination in Iceland. Her last name is Gudmundsdottir. WATTERS: OK. COMPAGNO: Juan, what do you think about this? WILLIAMS: Aren't the Japanese telling people not to scream on their roller coasters because that would spread the virus? I noticed in those videos, you don't have any mask on the people. So, I think they've got to be careful there, Emily. COMPAGNO: And Greg, take us home with this one. GUTFELD: Well, there's 300 -- what, 364,000 people in Iceland, so if you scream, no one is really going to hear you. The only thing I could say about Iceland. I've been there. It's beautiful. I ate a puffin. It tasted like licorice and shoelaces. WATTERS: No, Greg, you can't do that. GUTFELD: Yes, I ate a puffin and it didn't scream, not one bit. COMPAGNO: No, no. I don't believe that. WATTERS: No, you're not allowed to do that. GUTFELD: Yes, I ate a puffin. COMPAGNO: All right, \"FAN MAIL FRIDAY\" is up next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) GUTFELD: Yes, it's \"FAN MAIL FRIDAY.\" We're answering your questions. The first question is from Terry. Who is your favorite author and why? Jesse, I know you read a lot. WATTERS: Tolkien. GUTFELD: Tolkien? COMPAGNO: Yes, yes, I love him too, Jesse. Great. WATTERS: Thank you, Emily. Thank you. The second is Gutfeld. GUTFELD: You can't even take the hint. You can't even take the hint. WATTERS: The second is Gutfeld. I almost had it. GUTFELD: Kennedy, who's your favorite author? KENNEDY: Plato. I love Socratic dialogues. Big fan. GUTFELD: Who doesn't? Who doesn't? He's no Plotinus, though. Juan? KENNEDY: It sounds dirty. WILLIAMS: I'm a big fan of -- COMPAGNO: I know. WILLIAMS: I'm a big fan of Ralph Ellison who wrote Invisible Man, which I think is one -- is the greatest book of the 20th century so I got to -- I got to say Ralph Ellison. WATTERS: The movie was better than the book one. GUTFELD: Are you thinking about the original Invisible Man, Jesse? WILLIAMS: They're very different movie, Jesse. WATTERS: I'm thinking about the one out in Netflix right now. COMPAGNO: I just saw that the other night too. GUTFELD: I'm going to -- I'm going to go with -- OK, Emily, you're going to say Tolkien? COMPAGNO: Well, no, because Jesse already took it. So what I was doing to say was that I have a new mystery suspense author that I totally love. Her name is Tana French. She's out of Dublin, Ireland. I love every book that she has written. I highly recommend her. GUTFELD: I will recommend and I always do -- WILLIAMS: I can agree. GUTFELD: I don't even like fiction, but I love Jim Thompson. If you've ever read the Killer Inside Me, or the Grifters, which was a movie, or Population 1280, probably the best pulp writer of all time. He makes your skin crawl just reading him. And they're really short books too. They're disgusting. OK. Becky D. asks, what is one bad habit you had when you were younger but have since managed to stop? Kennedy? KENNEDY: I stopped -- no, I can't say that. No, that was -- that's a bad joke and I'm not allowed to tell that. Bad habit I managed to stop, I used to -- I used to count things a lot. I used to count things a lot. I guess it was like OCD and I worried if I didn't count things that something bad would happen to me. And fortunately, I don't -- I don't do that anymore. GUTFELD: I count things all the time. I count the days I have left on this planet, Emily. I'm sure you had some bad habits. COMPAGNO: Well, yes. I will say that I think I have -- I've improved my listening habits. I'm sure when I was a child, I think I was more like distractible, and now I am a more conscientious listener. GUTFELD: Oh, that's nice. Juan, how about you? What bad habits Did you have when you were younger that is no longer here? WILLIAMS: I trying -- you know, I think a lot of junk food, Greg. And I was thinking, you know, right now the baseball players aren't allowed to spit their sunflower seeds. And as a kid, I used to spit all the time with those sunflower seeds. Like you know, I don't do that anymore. I don't even eat sunflower seeds. I'm not in anybody's dugout. GUTFELD: What about you, Jesse? WATTERS: Crystal meth. From 2009 to 2014. I don't even remember. Apparently, I did a bunch of \"WATTERS' WORLD\" on the street. I have no idea. GUTFELD: You don't remember those ads they show the before and after. You actually ended up becoming better when you're on it because you were so horrible. WATTERS: Yes, I was born with meth mouth, and now this is what happened. GUTFELD: I'm with Juan, though. I had -- when I was younger, I told -- when I was 15, I said that I wanted a McDonald's in my house if I ever got rich. If I ever got rich, I was going to have a jack in the box or a McDonald's in my house. And now it's like, I can afford to eat that every single day. And I haven't had McDonald's in at least three weeks. It's killing me. WATTERS: We can tell, Greg. You look great. Is that what you were looking for? You look great. GUTFELD: Yes, that's exactly what I was looking for. Am I running out of time or do I have one more? One more. What are you secretly good at that no one knows? Emily? COMPAGNO: Well, so many things. I'll say dancing, but I feel like you guys know that because I cheered. GUTFELD: Well, I haven't seen you dance. COMPAGNO: That's boring. I'm sorry. GUTFELD: That was terrible. COMPAGNO: I know. GUTFELD: Juan, what's something that's surprisingly good nobody knows about that you're good at? WILLIAMS: Well, gee, I don't know. I'm pretty proud of what I do in the gym, but I don't -- you know, it's --at my age, I'm just trying to stay alive, Greg. GUTFELD: Yes, I hear you. WILLIAMS: We saw you in Houston, Juan, you have some speed. Come on. GUTFELD: What about you, Jesse? WILLIAMS: You're very kind. GUTFELD: What would -- what would surprise us that you're good at? Humility? WATTERS: That's a personal question. That's a personal question. And that's not the -- that's not the type of show that we're doing here tonight. GUTFELD: So you can't -- oh, I get it now. All right, Kennedy. KENNEDY: I'm good at untying knots. I can untie any not whether it's a necklace or string. For some reason, that's -- I'm really good at that. GUTFELD: Wow. You know, that actually is a talent because that's -- I cannot undo knots because I don't have any fingernails. WATTERS: Because you bite them. GUTFELD: Yes, I'm really, really good at biting fingernails. WATTERS: That's your bad habit. GUTFELD: I can bite fingernails to a point where that doesn't hurt. I know exactly when to stop. Yes, I messed up. All right, let's go. \"ONE MORE THING\" is up next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) WATTERS: It's time now for \"ONE MORE THING.\" Greg? GUTFELD: All right, tomorrow night, the \"GREG GUTFELD SHOW,\" Saturday 10:00 p.m. We've got Dave Rubin. We've got some lady named Emily. We have Kat Timpf and Tyrus. That's 10:00 p.m. Watch it so I could beat Jesse. All right, let's do this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GUTFELD: Animals are great. Animals are great. Animals are great. (END VIDEO CLIP) GUTFELD: Jesse beat me in the demo by 10,000. It can't happen again. WATTERS: Don't bite your nails anymore over that, Greg. GUTFELD: All right, I love ping pong. I love watching ping pong. Check out this fellow here enjoying the greatness Have a great ping pong match. It's like -- it's like a viewer at home watching and Jesse and Juan argue forever. This is exactly what it's like. Isn't that great? Look at that. I could watch this for days. Yes. All right, that's enough. WATTERS: All right, speaking of animals, a kangaroo was arrested, of course in Florida. We don't know what the kangaroo did. We think the kangaroo toppled the statue of Ponce de Leon. But he's not talking to investigators, so we're going to have to wait and see how he pleads in kangaroo court which he will be going to momentarily. COMPAGNO: Oh my God, he really is behind bars. WATTERS: Oh yes. COMPAGNO: Oh my, God. WATTERS: Oh yes. He didn't -- they don't have bail reform down there so he had to spend the night in the slammer. All right, \"WATTERS' WORLD\" 8:00 p.m. We are going to have a Watters' words here that makes Joe Biden unlikable. Juan says he's likable. After you Watters' words, you're going to realize how unlikeable he is. Don't miss it. Kennedy? KENNEDY: It's been disgusting for subway fights lately. Anyone who's written rails in New York City knows that. In Singapore, look at these dirty rats. They took it up a notch. Yes, look at these two. They're just fighting like crazy. But the best part is there's a cat lurking in the distance watching these to exhaust themselves because the cat knows as soon as they're completely spent -- because we all know that boxing is the most cardio heavy sport there is. The cat is going to swoop in on both. He's going to have a meal and leftovers. Take that you dirty rats. See, that's the cat going in. Keep going. COMPAGNO: Oh my gosh. WATTERS: That's like when Juan and Greg fight and I have to break it up. Juan, you're u. WILLIAMS: Thank goodness. All right, so guys, life is full of surprises. One day, you're walking down the street and all of a sudden, your ears perk up. You look over and there's a 71-year-old guy testing an old piano left as junk on the street, and you think that guy's pretty good. Take a look. Yes, that's Billy Joel, the five-time Grammy winner. Billy Joel got off his motorcycle in Huntington, Long Island. When he saw the piano, he ran through some tunes as people stopped to listen. Joel told the passers-by that piano is in good shape and should go to the local church. Way to go, Piano Man. WATTERS: That's right. When you leave your junk on the street, Elton John comes along and plays it. KENNEDY: Billy Joel. COMPAGNO: Elton John, Billy Joel, that's amazing. WATTERS: Billy Joel, Elton John. COMPAGNO: OK, you guys, today is World Emoji Day. And according to emoji- pedia, the two most popular ones are faced with tears of joy and loudly crying face. And here are some of my favorite emojis. And of course, everyone who knows me, you know I love to bitmoji. This is my favorite, always excited. I love you guys. Happy World Emoji Day. WATTERS: That's right. And Elton John, I'm sorry about that, and Billy Joel, whoever you are.

That is in just a moment.We will discuss the brand-new RNC news in terms of the convention in Florida has been canceled and the president's reasons why. What is the backup plan? We'll ask him that.We'll also talk about the violence, the -- literally, what he calls the war zone in America's cities. We'll talk about the upcoming election, COVID-19, left-wing conspiracy theories, Joe Biden, a lot to get to tonight.First, we do have major breaking news surrounding what we have identified on this show correctly as the biggest abuse of power, corruption scandal in American history, and that is Obama, Biden, Comey working together to destroy President Trump, first candidate Trump and transition team Trump.Now we have more definitive proof tonight because a bombshell document has now tonight been declassified by the DNI Director Radcliffe. It shows the most extreme measures that Jim Comey, Mr. Higher Honor himself, his FBI took in 2016 to spy on then-candidate Donald Trump.These newly unearthed materials include typewritten notes from an FBI agent named Joe Pientka detailing August 2016 briefing with Donald Trump, Lieutenant General Flynn and former Governor Chris Christie of New Jersey.The meeting was supposed to be just a routine defensive briefing that presidential candidates received from the FBI, but in truth, in reality, it was all a ruse. According to a source, the briefing was, quote, a cover to listen for any remarks from President Trump or anyone else about Russia.So, let's be clear, we now have indisputable evidence that the FBI literally early on planted a Crossfire Hurricane agent to spy on Team Trump. It also means that Jim Comey, Mr. Higher Honor, is caught in another massive lie.Jim, I reminded you a long time ago -- well, you have the rewrite to remain silent, I advised you to use. You should have listened. By the way, he testified that Trump was not under investigation, proving another lie. Take a look.All right, apparently, we didn't have that. We'll have it hopefully soon.Like he lied when he said the dirty dossier. Remember he went to Trump Tower, took notes as soon as he left, and he said that the dossier presented it alone to then -- well, President-elect Trump, said it's salacious but unverified.But we know that he used that dossier as the bulk of information to secure the FISA warrant to spy on candidate Trump just a month earlier.The official notes from the security briefing were filed under Crossfire Hurricane, which of course, was the official code name for Comey's Russia collusion witch hunt. It was a witch hunt.By the way, that bought and paid for dirty Russian dossier of Russian disinformation, Hillary paid for that. Guess who helped Hillary? It looks like Vladimir Putin's Russia.It was also filed under Crossfire Razor. Remember, that was the code name for the FBI's probe into and we now know the innocent Lieutenant General Michael Flynn. It is now time for investigative prosecutor Durham to now wrap this up, bring this to a grand jury, and we need indictments of every single solitary person involved in this corruption, this abuse of power, their premeditated lies to the FISA court, their denial of one American of civil liberties and constitutional rights, and them trying to influence the outcome of an election, and then undo a duly elected president.Mr. Durham, no more time for investigating. It's time for action. The evidence is overwhelming. It is incontrovertible. That and the public domain that we know could -- should result in indictments up all of these people we talk about.Now, get this. The agent that did conduct this, quote, briefing, Joe Pientka, was apparently running the Flynn probe. And his, quote, briefing notes were approved by none other than the infamous Peter Strzok and the FBI lawyer -- we talked a lot about him too -- Kevin Clinesmith.Remember, Clinesmith, he was the corrupt FBI bureaucrat, he literally texted colleagues that Trump supporters were crazies, and that Vice President Pence was stupid, and after Trump won, he texted, viva la resistance.And according to Inspector General Horowitz, it was Clinesmith literally forging FISA evidence against Carter Page all to spy on, backdoor spy on candidate Trump, transition team Trump and deep into the presidency of Donald Trump. And, of course, Clinesmith, Strzok, and Pientka, well, they were just a tip of the spear in this Russia collusion hoax.Now, this was an effort that started at the very top. This was the insurance policy in the unlikely event that he wins. That was Page and Peter Strzok texting each other. Now, that's what Obama's infamous, remember this date, January 5th, 2017, that was the Oval Office meeting.You know, that was the meeting that Obama directed, we need the right people on this doing the work. And maybe we shouldn't tell all of this to the incoming administration.This is the January 5th meeting in the Oval Office where Joe Biden who lied to George Stephanopoulos, I didn't know anything about this, where we know from Peter Strzok's handwritten notes that Biden suggested that the FBI used the 1799 Logan Act, which has never been used ever to prosecute anyone.Now, remember this was the meeting that Sally Yates was at, and she was shocked according to her testimony before the House Intelligence Committee that President Obama knew all of the intimate details about the unmasking and leaking of raw intelligence as it relates to General Flynn, and, of course, soon to be Russian counterpart Kislyak.That's why Susan Rice went back on the day that Donald Trump was inaugurated 15 days after this Oval Office meeting to write what is now known as the biggest CYA email to self on Obama's last day, Trump being sworn in day, claiming that Barack said, do everything by the book. Why would she write that four times, 15 days later?Now, this was clearly an effort to, first, monitor and take down the new president, to undo an election, and take down everyone around him. But as we all know, although the mob and the media, they've gotten all of this wrong. They pushed lies, smears, besmirchment, conspiracy theories, the entire hoax, they were dragging and pushing impeachment, ignoring quid pro quo Joe and zero experience Hunter.There was no Russia collusion. It was always a hoax. The dossier that was used for all of these FISA applications has been debunked. It was never verifiable. We know the sub source said it was just bar talk and we know that Steele had an agenda and that everybody was warned way ahead of time that Hillary paid for the Russian disinformation.Now, the real scandal, the real abuse of power is that President Obama, what did you know, Barack, when did you know it? Joe, the ever confused one, what did you know, Joe, and when did you know it?We know they turn tremendous tools of your government against their political adversary. It's a national disgrace, all must be held accountable, prosecutor Durham, we are waiting. What we know already should be indictments for many. It's time!If we don't get this right, we will not have a constitutional republic. We won't have equal justice and equal application of our laws.Here with mark, Ohio Congressman Jim Jordan, FOX News contributor Sara Carter, FOX News legal analyst Gregg Jarrett.Congressman Jordan, we start with you.There is enough that we know, all of us --REP. JIM JORDAN, R-OHIO: Yes.HANNITY: -- there was not many of us, between Congress and our ensemble cast, that we're digging deep into this. I count maybe 25 people total taking on the entire media mob. They were all wrong.My question to you is, what does this say to you and what does it say to Durham?The FBI went to then-candidate Trump, told him Russia might try to target you and your campaign. What they didn't tell him is, we're targeting you. They told him Russian might try to spy on you. What they didn't tell him is, we're spying on you, and they did it just 17 days into this investigation.It opens on July 31st. August 17th, they do this. Thirteen minutes for the defensive briefing as part of the briefing you're supposed to get and in an hour and 42 minutes, where they are trying to get information and set the president up.All of this comes after, as you said, Sean, the August 8th text message where Peter Strzok says, we'll stop Trump. And the August 15th text message where he says, we've got an insurance policy. And they start implementing that insurance policy two days later.HANNITY: Sara Carter, you were there with John Solomon. It was March 2017 when the whole unmasking thing began. I had a conversation with both you, soon thereafter, Gregg Jarrett joined in. Got to keep unpeeling the layers of onion. I think it's now an infamous discussion we've had.SARA CARTER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Absolutely, Sean. And look at these documents, they are explosive because if you think about it, there was August 2016, here is Joe Pientka, right, debriefing basically Trump and Governor Christie and Michael Flynn.And then in January, he goes back to the White House with Peter Strzok. He goes back to the White House -- remember, he is the one that's interviewing Michael Flynn and collecting the information, all the while, just as Congressman Jordan says, they're spying on the president of the United States.You know, this is something that is so explosive and so big. And if John Durham doesn't do his job, it doesn't mean that just these three were involved, Sean. What you have to think about is the scope of this. Both Pientka, Peter Strzok, as well as Kevin Clinesmith and all the others were directed by people above them. That is Andrew McCabe, that's James Comey, and that's those folks that were at the White House, including the president, then -- Barack Obama who knew everything that was going on in January 5th.HANNITY: And they need to be asked. Barack needs to answer --CARTER: Yes.HANNITY: -- what did he know and when did he know it? Same with Joe.My question to you, Gregg Jarrett. You wrote two number one best-selling books on this, amazing work that you did.On the legal side of this, what we now have in the public domain is enough to get indictments for all of these people as far as I'm concerned.GREGG JARRETT, FOX NEWS LEGAL ANALYST: Yes.HANNITY: You tell me as a lawyer if I'm wrong and why is it taking so long?At this point, I think the Prosecutor Durham has an obligation to get this over with and let the American people know, we need to know before November 3rd of this year.JARRETT: Well, I think Durham has been slow footed, I agree. COVID may have been slow down a bit.But if there was ever any doubt about how devious and corrupt James Comey and his cabal were, they should remove doubt. This meeting was not about debriefing Trump. It was about gathering incriminating evidence of a non- existing collusion conspiracy that the FBI well knew was a hoax. They knew it was a lie, paid for by the Hillary Clinton campaign. They didn't care.At the heart of it, you're right, Joe Pientka, I write about him in my book. But interestingly, the government has scrubbed him from all reports, including the FBI report, and the Department of Justice report, even the FISA court report, and the FBI has removed him from their website and sequestered him in San Francisco's field office refusing to make him available, notwithstanding repeated demands to Congress. That's the cover- up by the existing FBI Director Christopher Wray.And the other part of this equation is that the documents today, they're exculpatory. They tend to prove Trump innocence. And yet, the FBI and Christopher Wray have concealed these documents, along with the intel community, for the better part of four years.It's unconscionable. It's corrupt. And it's a cover-up (ph).(CROSSTALK)HANNITY: We had a little problem earlier. Let me hear it, because this is Comey now denying that which we now know is true. This guy said -- the holier-than-thou Mr. Higher honor is so full of beep, beep, beep, I can't even say it. I wish I could. I can say it, but I'm going to have to deal with, you know, the fallout after.Here's what he said.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. RICHARD BURR, R-NC: Was the FBI able to confirm any criminal allegations contained in the Steele document?JAMES COMEY, FORMER FBI DIRECTOR: Mr. Chairman, I don't think that's a question I can answer in an open setting, because it goes into the details of the investigation.SEN. SUSAN COLLINS, R-MAINE: I want first to ask you about your conversations with the president, the three conversations in which you told him that he was not under investigation. The first was during your January 6th meeting, according to your testimony, in which it appears that you actually volunteered that insurance. Is that correct?COMEY: That's correct.COLLINS: Did you limit that statement to counterintelligence investigations, or were you talking about any kind of FBI investigation?COMEY: I didn't -- I didn't use the term counterintelligence. I was speaking to him and briefing him about some salacious and unverified material.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: That proves, Jim Jordan, he lied.JORDAN: Yes.HANNITY: And when he signed the first FISA warrant in October of 2016, and then went to Trump Tower and I believe it was December of 2017 and said it's salacious and unverified, well, in the FISA application, bulk of information of the dirty dossier, he said it was verified. He's a liar.JORDAN: Yes, he told Gowdy during the deposition that President Trump wasn't under investigation when we know based on his document that but just 17 days into the investigation, they were investigating the president for no reason, no predicate whatsoever.He also told us during that deposition that after ten months, when he gets fired May 9th, 2017, they didn't have a thing. We knew they didn't have anything. He knew they didn't have anything.Clapper, Brennan, Comey, they've all said the same thing, there wasn't anything there, and yet they put the country through this.I also think it's important, Sean, look at the names on the front page Sara was talking about. Clinesmith, the guy who lied to the FISA court. Pientka, who handles the Flynn investigation who did this -- this interview as well, or this briefing, whatever you call it. And then, of course, Peter Strzok who ran the whole darn thing.Those are the three names on the front page, as well as Crossfire Hurricane, and imagine this come, Crossfire Razor. They were after Mike Flynn from the get-go as well. That's what the front page of this document that was declassified today. That's what it shows us.HANNITY: All right, thank you all. We're going to be watching.Mr. Durham, we're ready. It's time. You've got enough time now.Thank you all.Now, President Trump is coming up in mere moments, literally within the next 10 minutes I'm told. It was just announced -- he just announced today a bold, new expansion what is known as Operation LeGend. Why? To help combat the war zones, the crime, the anarchy that is literally wreaking havoc and killing innocent Americans and people are not safe and secure in their own towns, their own cities.But over there at fake news MSNBC, the conspiracy channel, Joy Reid, congratulations on your new time slot, saying rising crime numbers are fairy tale is not exactly accurate. Well, then, she invited Congresswoman Maxine Waters in to discuss insane conspiracy theories that Trump is invading cities with a parliamentary and secret police as the trial run for the coming election coup.Watch for yourself.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. MAXINE WATERS, D-CALIF.: As a matter of fact, it has been suggested that this is a trial run of the president of the United States, who may be organizing to not accept what happened when we have the election if he's not elected.JOY REID, MSNBC HOST: And he helpfully said the quiet part out loud by pointing out that the cities that will be in a sense invaded by Trump's secret police led by Democratic mayors.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: It's not just Maxine in Joy Reid show spouting these insane ideas. By the way, this is their next hoax. If they hear the words and have to choke on the words over there, we can now come project Donald J. Trump has been reelected the 45th president of the United States. You, the American people, you will decide that in 103 days. I hope you choose wisely.There is a lot at stake. Take a look.(BERGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: People are looking at potentially a trial run for a kind of genuine attempt to true intimidation and potentially through force to try to, to try to steal this election.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The problem here is, apparently, the president has this imaginary world in his head where he thinks the U.S. cities are under siege.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The idea that federal agents are in a city with Americans, that is not really the point here. This is like secret police snatching up Americans, taking them into cars.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: You know, I take a look at this psychotic story from the insane Washington compost. It says Trump's assault on election integrity forces question. What will happen if we refuse to accept the election loss?What will Joe do? How about that?The left is now willing to do, say anything to beat President Trump. They are in a full panic, I can tell you that tonight. And, buckle up, it is going to be an insane 103 days.Remember, Nancy Pelosi referring to federal agents in Portland, calling them stormtroopers. Jim Clyburn also in leadership in the Democratic House, comparing federal agents to Nazi Gestapo.Of the Democratic representatives claiming Trump is trying to start a race war. No, he's trying to save lives.In Seattle, that ever incompetent far left Mayor Jenny Durkan, remember the summer of love zone? Remember, it's an autonomous zone, the CHAZ, CHOP zone, the spaghetti pot luck dinner zone, telling fake news CNN that she was very unsettled. People died because of the stupidity of her not maintaining law and order.Take a look.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MAYOR JENNY DURKAN, D-SEATTLE: I have to tell you, it's so unsettling the president continues down this path. And I think it's unfortunate again the president is using federal law enforcement as a political tool. That is so dangerous for America.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: What's dangerous is, is that you allowed a mob, an anarchist to take over city blocks, including a police precinct four weeks. You called at the summer of love, spaghetti pot luck dinner zone.Well, I had to call come -- apparently, you didn't -- you take the time to call Horace Lorenzo Anderson Sr., who lost his 19-year-old son, killed in your summer of love zone. You wouldn't allow the police to restore order until -- well, let's see, that's right, what to young African-Americans were murdered in that zone. Many others injured.And according to a report, President Trump plans to send a tactical seem to Seattle as standby if the violent riots continue because she's allowing it.We got the same problem in Portland. We've got the dopey mayor there, the guy's name is Ted Wheeler. Loud riots now to fester there for 55 straight days. Apparently, Wheeler thinks this is mostly peaceful protesting.I saw a lot of rocks, bottles, graffiti, literally businesses shut down, total mess. Take a look.(VIDEO CLIP PLAYS)HANNITY: Ted Wheeler, does your city look safe and secure to you? Or I might just not believing what I'm saying?In fact, apparently, this dope once federal agents in Portland actually to go home, stop protecting the federal buildings that under law they're supposed to protect that were lit on fire last night. Ted Wheeler is totally detached like so many other liberals. You have all these liberal mayors. They have one thing in command. They have led their cities, no safety, no security and rotten educational systems for decades.He seems to think that there's absolutely nothing wrong with the anarchy playing out in his city. Last night, he was actually there in support of the anarchists, where ironically he ended up being harassed and stalked and assaulted.Democrats are now living in an upside down world. They vilify the police while the appeasing of violent rioters. They let violent criminals out of jail. There's no bail in New York, with those stupid policies. They trashed the president for trying to protect innocent life and send in help to stop the violence and restore law and order. And time and time again, they put politics and hatred of Donald Trump over the lives and safety of their own citizens.By the way, come November, well, you will let them take the reins of the entire country because only you have the power to stop it at the ballot box because Joe Biden is a guy that said, yes, the police have now become the enemy, and, of course, I support reallocating funds. Now, he's denying it, but he said it. We have the tape.Here with reaction, Fox\u00a0News contributor Dan Bongino, Fox\u00a0News correspondent at large, Geraldo Rivera, civil rights attorney, Leo Terrell.Geraldo, we begin with you.You know what, Geraldo, what I love about you, is you love your fellow human beings. You have been a street reporter as we say, all these years, trying to help people with better, safer lives.These cities aren't safe. Against all logic and reason, they won't allow any help to prevent violence and death. Why?GERALDO RIVERA, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT-AT-LARGE: Why? Because they are politicians and bad politicians. Ted Wheeler, the mayor there in Portland, booed off of the stage, ridiculed, they were yelling for his resignation by the time his attempt at street theater was over.Meantime, in Chicago, another 3-year-old child, another 3-year-old girl was shot yesterday. Ten people a shot total, three of them died. Three more murders in Chicago yesterday. And that is with all the heat on the gangsters.HANNITY: Yes.RIVERA: And the police superintendent there, David Brown, proud black man, got up there and announced to the world that there are ten times as many gangbangers as they were Chicago cops.HANNITY: Unbelievable.RIVERA: There are 12,000 Chicago cops, 117,000 gangsters. I mean, at what point do the people, the average citizens in that city just revolt? At what point do they say, screw you, mayor, we need all the help we can get? And even then it might not be enough.(CROSSTALK)HANNITY: Joe Biden is misleading them, Geraldo.All right. I'd just gotten the two-minute warning in my ear. That means the president will be taking over for you three, not that you are not great guests and good friends.Dan Bongino, you get the last 2 minutes.DAN BONGINO, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, just a quick piece of misinformation we have to correct here. These are not federal troops. They are federal agents. They are not unmarked. They do have markings.There are also federal agents -- to correct again, more liberal misinformation I've heard on cable news. There are federal agents, listening up, folks, in every major city in America right now. They don't need permission from anyone to enforce federal law. Whoever told you that is absolutely lying.So there you go. More liberal misinformation.HANNITY: Don't we want safety and security? Leo Terrell, one day, I'm going to pull out the old tapes, just for old times' sake of you being on the show and you and I disagreeing on pretty much everything.LEO TERRELL, CIVIL RIGHTS ATTORNEY: No.HANNITY: I'm going to pull out the tape of you ripping out your earpiece, throw it on your microphone.TERRELL: No, no, no, listen, let me get my minute. Let me get my minute end. Let me get my minute in.President Trump, this is Leo Trump 2.0. I'm telling you keep providing safety of these cities.CNN, MSNBC, you are lying to your Democrats. Look at the film footage that Sean just showed about these cities. You're lying. And if you -- stop having these commentators lie about the lack of violence. There's total violence.President Trump, continue to do your job. Law and order in these Democratic cities. It's ridiculous. Totally ridiculous.HANNITY: But apparently, we have an extra minute and a half.All right. Geraldo --TERRELL: Good.HANNITY: I -- well, I hate -- you know, you are all favorite people. So, I mean, you're my -- we're all best friends.But I really -- I want the president to act. He can't act, Geraldo, unless there's 15 mayors in all these liberal cities are saying, we don't want your help! What is -- what is wrong with these people?RIVERA: Chicago though, Sean -- if Chicago is the model, and the mayor is squawking about federal troops and the front door and accepting federal help in the back door. I'm OK with that. I'm OK with politics as long as they get the job done.How do you get the job done? You have to go after these organized criminal gangs and put them out of business, Sean.HANNITY: All right. The president is on the line, just for kicks and giggles.I want Leo Terrell, lifelong Democrat, I want you to tell the president in 30 seconds why you're voting for him and for the first time ever, right, for a Republican ever.TERRELL: Yes, President Trump, I want you to listen to me. Give me call me later on. The first time ever in my entire life as a Republican, I'm voting for you. Now, maintain what you're doing in these Democratic cities, and I will go to those networks and battle those guys for you. You're going to win in November, I guarantee it. I'm out there with you 24/7.PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP\u00a0(via telephone): -- very much. And you have come a long way, Leo. I have to tell you.(LAUGHTER)TRUMP: I've been watching you, and I've always respected even on the other side.(CROSSTALK)TERRELL: I'm here, I'm here. I'm here, I'm here now. I'm here right now! I'm here.TRUMP: I appreciate it, I do. I will do that.TERRELL: Thank you. Thank you.TRUMP: Thanks, Leo. Really great.HANNITY: All right. Leo, Geraldo, thank you, Dan Bongino.All right. I think that might have been the funniest we've had.Mr. President, sir, thank you so much for joining us. I know it's been a busy number of days here for you.A lot of news to get to. I want to spend a lot of time on the violence, the safety, security of our cities.TRUMP: Yes.HANNITY: I want to talk about COVID a lot.Let's start with some breaking news, and that is that you earlier today decided to pull back on the convention in Jacksonville. You gave a reason. Can you give us the reasons again in more detail?TRUMP: Well, it's really the China virus. Call it COVID. Call it any one of a lot of different names.But we're setting an example. We don't want to have people so close together. We have had such enthusiasm. Everybody wanted to go there. We went to North Carolina. We wanted to do it there. It was all set. We were going to build a beautiful facility. And it got hit hard. And the governor then, really, he could have treated us better, Democrat governor.But we are actually opening up there. And then we will make -- we will make our ways. It won't be your typical convention. I can say that, but it's going to be very safe.And I thought I had an obligation not to have large numbers, massive numbers of people crowded into a room.HANNITY: I have been told, Mr. President, from sources of mine -- you can confirm if you like -- I guess maybe I'm not surprised, that you're entertaining ideas that I have heard tonight that would be pretty spectacular.Would you give us any insight into what they are?TRUMP: Well, we have some ideas, but it'll have to be different than your typical convention.We have just great enthusiasm in the party. I don't think we have ever had it, even more so than 2016. And you see what's going on with the polls.Since -- it's funny. Since I did a -- I made a speech at Mount Rushmore. And since that time, it's been really something. There's been -- I mean, before that, really. You have all of these fake, these suppression polls, and just like 2016, when they put out these phony polls, the media.But I will tell you what. It's -- that the enthusiasm this party has and that they have for their president, because we're keeping our cities safe. We want to go in. We can't understand.I heard you talking with the group. Really, that's a group of -- a great group of three people. But I heard you talking about the cities and the safeties of the cities.I have offered them all, every one of them -- and there's 10 of them. We're offering all of them, let us go in. We will clean it up. We will clean it up.Now, in Portland, we had to do it because that was -- that's -- they're anarchists. That's even -- that's a level that people haven't seen, but they're anarchists.And they were going wild for 51 days. And we went in. And they have done a great job. They were going to rip down the courthouse, a big federal courthouse, gorgeous federal courthouse.So, we went in. And we have been very, very strong. And we have this Mayor Whalen (sic), who I think is also -- he's also the police commissioner, as I understand it, in Portland.HANNITY: Wheeler, yes.TRUMP: Mayor Wheeler.And he's -- he made a fool out of himself last -- he wanted to be among the people. So, he went into the crowd. And they knocked the hell out of him. That was the end of him. So, it was pretty, pretty pathetic.But we want to go in and help the cities. We want to help Chicago. We want to help all of them. Detroit's having problems. A very good police chief in Detroit, but they have problems.We will go into all of the cities, any of the cities. We're ready. We will put in 50,000, 60,000 people that really know what they're doing. And they're strong. They're tough. And we could solve these problems so fast.But, as you know, we have to be invited in.HANNITY: Mr. President, I want to ask you about that.TRUMP: At some point, we're going to have to do something that's much stronger than being invited in. But we have to be invited in.Go ahead, Sean.HANNITY: The acting DHS chief, Chad Wolf, there are statutory reasons and justification to protect federal buildings. That is what has been happening, when you talk about 100 agents.We now have 15 mayors. We see this rise in homicides and shootings. One day right here on this program a couple of nights ago, 15 people shot in Chicago, last weekend, 70 people shot, 12 dead, a 10-year-old, 11-year-old shot.You spoke to Horace Lorenzo Anderson Sr. I know you invited him to the White House. He lost his 19-year-old son. We lost an 8-year-old little girl in the CHAZ Autonomous Zone in Atlanta, a 1-year-old in Brooklyn, a 7-year- old little beautiful young girl in Chicago.And they -- the one thing that all of these cities have in common, they have been run by liberal Democratic mayors, liberal Democratic governors for decades.TRUMP: Right.HANNITY: What do you say to the people? Most people would argue, you don't have a chance of winning New York, or Illinois, or California, or Washington state.TRUMP: Well, you're right.They're run by very liberal people, you could say radical left in some cases, in some cases, just liberal Democrats. And they're not taking care of their police. They're not respecting the police. The police do an incredible job. It's a very tough job. It's a very dangerous job.And these mayors and, by the way, governors and senators and congressmen, Democrat congressmen, they want to pass stuff to make the police -- they want to take all of their power away. And you will have a bad situation, where you will have a bad cop, a very bad cop. And they have no idea the problem they cause.But you have 99 percent great people that work hard and get paid not nearly enough. And the job they do is incredible. And these people are just taking all of their respect. They're taking their guts out. And it's a shame. It's a shame.And the police, they could do the job. In Seattle, they could. They knew that we were coming in. And they went in just before we got there. So, we were all set to move. But if we weren't going to go in, if they thought that we weren't coming in, it would still be bad.But those police can do the job. But the mayor and everybody tells them not to do it. The governor, they say not to do it. And it's a philosophy.And let me tell you, if Joe Biden ever got in, the whole country would be like that. We have a lot of great cities. We have a lot of very safe cities, great places, great states that don't have any problems. And they look at the things that they see in Chicago, and they look at what they're witnessing in Portland and all of these different places, and they can't believe what's going on.But we have -- we have great places. But we have some instances that nobody's ever seen.I spoke with the mayor of Chicago, Mayor Lightfoot, and had a great talk. But within minutes after that talk -- you just reported it tonight -- a couple of more people were shot. Young, very young children were shot.HANNITY: Sad. So sad.TRUMP: And it's a shame. It's a shame.And we could solve it. If they invited us in, we'd go in with 50,000, 75,000 people. We would be able to solve it, like you wouldn't believe, and quick. But they just don't want to ask, maybe for political reasons. But they don't want to ask. It's a disgrace.HANNITY: Let me ask you, Mr. President.I know a lot has been made over Joe Biden and his comments that he made. I know he's now backed off it. And he says, well, I said it before the other way. I don't know if he's just not remembering what maybe somebody else wrote in \"USA Today,\" for example, but he did say police have now become the enemy, when they're supposed to help people.And then a follow-up was, would you support re-appropriating the money? And he said yes, now, not using the term. Democrats seem to be walking back the term defund. But reallocation is the word he used. Well, that would be the same thing.Let me play it, so to remind our audience what he said.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOE BIDEN, D-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Surplus military equipment for law enforcement, they don't need that.The last thing you need is an up-armored Humvee coming into a neighborhood. It's like the military invading. They don't know anybody. They become the enemy. They're supposed to be protecting these people.So, my generic point is that...UNIDENTIFIED MALE: But can we agree that we can redirect some of the funding?BIDEN: Yes, absolutely.One of the things that we also need to be doing is fundamentally changing the way -- and I have been pushing it for years -- changing the way we deal with our prison system.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: Mr. President, I can remind people, you're the one that did criminal justice reform. Biden, as vice president, Barack, they did not. You did police reform. They did not.You also set record after record low unemployment. They added 13 million more Americans to food stamps, eight million more in poverty, and the lowest labor participation rates since the '70s. You set record low after record low for every demographic group.And we got Opportunity Zones, your biggest commitment in terms of money and length of time to historically black colleges. They didn't do any of those things.Your answer to what Joe Biden -- now he's now -- he's adopting the position of the, yes, police are the enemies, he's never said a good word, Bolshevik Bernie's economic agenda, AOC's New Green Deal agenda. He's pledging trillions of taxpayer dollars.And add to that, let's see, Beto O'Rourke and Pelosi, Schumer and Biden, 125 years in the swamp. Your reaction to his team?TRUMP: Well, it's all true.But one of the things you mentioned and he mentioned was the surplus military equipment. And when I came in, as soon as I came in, I distributed to all of the police departments all over the nation. We had hundreds of millions of dollars of -- sometimes new, but it was never going to be used.It was sitting in warehouses all over the U.S. And I delivered it all to police, free of charge, all to police. It was just growing dust. It was just -- just sitting there, just, I guess, paying rent or whatever they were doing in all these massive warehouses.And I got it all out to the police. And they were so thankful. And, you know, a lot of it was protective equipment. And they didn't want to do it, because they thought the police looked too strong, that it was sending a wrong signal to the police.But it was really protecting the police. And there was offensive capability, but there was a lot of protective capability. And it was really amazing to me, what -- that they wouldn't deliver it, they wouldn't -- they wouldn't do it.And I -- and I have gotten notes. I have gotten so many notes from the heads of the police departments, and even from the cops, just the guys on the beat, thanking me for all of the equipment that we send out. And we were never going to use it. It was growing old and growing dusty.So, that's a whole different way of thinking, but -- and when he -- when you talk about the Bernie Sanders thing, I think what Joe Biden -- and I don't think it was him. I think it was radical left people that are totally controlling him, like a puppet. I don't think it's him. I don't think he knows even what we're talking about.But when we talk about Biden, he's got a manifesto that he agreed to -- I call it a manifesto -- with Bernie Sanders for open borders and things that you wouldn't even believe. I mean, these are left-wing at a level that I don't think Bernie ever talked about to the same extent.You would think there's a negotiation, that Bernie would be brought to the right a little bit. I think Bernie went further left, and Biden agreed to all of this stuff.HANNITY: Let me ask you.Sir, I have been in talk radio for 33 years, believe it or not, since I began that journey. I have been blessed to work here at Fox. I'm now in my 25th year here. Politics is a passion of mine.Usually, you have candidates -- you're probably an exception -- what you say -- what you said in 2016 is what you did. You...TRUMP: Yes.HANNITY: In many ways, people haven't figured out you're very predictable, in the sense that, if you say it, you mean it, in my view.But, usually, people run to the base for the primary, and then they run to the center. Joe Biden has adopted Bolshevik Bernie's radical socialism, AOC's New Green Deal. We're talking about trillions of dollars he's now committing to both those things, redistribution, higher taxes.Then I mentioned Beto O'Rourke, and then Schumer, Pelosi and Biden have had 20 -- 125 years.Why, in this case, do you believe he's going harder left than any candidate I have ever seen in my lifetime, for sure?TRUMP: Because I think he's afraid of the people on his left.I think that, when -- these are very radicalized people. I mean, he's gone so far. He's given Bernie everything. Bernie can't even believe it. I heard Bernie's going around saying, I can't believe what we got.And this was a negotiation that was done very quickly.And, today, I saw President Obama with him. And remember this. I wouldn't be there if it weren't for those two. If they did a good job, I wouldn't -- you know, I ran. I ran against what they did. And I won.And nobody campaigned harder than President Obama. Somebody said, oh, Obama's coming, and I said, that's OK, we beat him the last time. I think he campaigned harder than Hillary Clinton did, if you want to know the truth. Remember I would always talk about here comes Air Force One? Obama was all over the place.But the fact is, Biden and Obama, I'm here, I'm in the White House because of them. If they did a good job -- people forget, but if they did a good job, and except for the China virus that came in, we were setting every record you could set for unemployment, for the stock market, every single record you could imagine.And then what we did, we rebuilt the military. We got rid of regulations at a level that no administration even in eight years or in one case, more than that, no administration has come close. And we've appointed -- you know, we will have almost, it could even be more, but almost 300 federal judges appointed by the end of my first term. That's a record. Nobody's ever done anything like that. And two Supreme Court judges, great ones.HANNITY: All right. Let me go to Joe Biden. I argue, and I've watched this and witnessed this my whole professional life, I think that the job you have, I believe, regardless of who is president, is the hardest job in the world. You have a lot of burdens on your shoulder, anybody that is president. And I think when they asked Reagan in 1984 in that question whether or not he had the mental alertness, the strength, the stamina to do the job, it was a fair question.He answered it in one line in the second debate against Mondale. Let me play some of the greatest hits of Biden and then Biden from yesterday. And I want your take on what is going on with Joe Biden. Let's play it first.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)(PHONE RINGING)BIDEN: The scale, the scale of the loss is staggering. I don't know whose phone that is. But the scale of the loss is staggering.It has been two months since Congress gave them that money.Introduce me?(INAUDIBLE)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: OK. Yes, sir.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Am I on?BIDEN: Good evening.Thanks so much for tuning in.Look, tomorrow is Super Thursday -- Tuesday, and I want to thank you all.I'll tell you all, I'm rushing ahead, aren't I?We hold these truths to be self-evident, all men and women created by -- you know the thing.My name is Joe Biden and I'm a Democratic candidate for the United States Senate. Look me over, you like what you see, help out.Do you agree with me? Go to Joe 30330.We choose truth over facts.Play the radio, make sure the television -- excuse me, make sure you have the record player on at night, the phone -- make sure that kids hear words.Poor kids are just as bright and just as talented as white kids.Donald Trump does pose an extra threat (ph) to this -- it's not hypothetical.Why in God's name should someone who is clipping coupons in the stock market make -- in fact, pay a lower tax rate than someone who, in fact, is, like I said, a schoolteacher and a firefighter?I'm sorry, I'm confused who I am talking to here. But anyway, whoever it is...And I had a nurse that -- nurses at Walter Reed Hospital who would bend down and whisper in my ear, go home and get me pillows. They would make sure they would actually -- probably nothing ever taught in -- you can't do it in the COVID time, but they would actually breathe in my nostrils to make me move.Wearing a mask is now a political statement? This is more patriotic. Why do you wear the mask? So you don't make somebody else sick. Sick. What is with this guy?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Steve (ph), that's our time.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: OK.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: Mr. President, I'm not a doctor, I won't play one. I don't see -- I think Joe Biden has aged dramatically since he has left office. He doesn't seem very alert. They seem to be protecting him and hiding him. We now have interviews that are being shut off by handlers. What is your reaction, sir?TRUMP: Well, in all fairness, I know people that are 90, 91, 92 that are sharp as a tack. Bernie Marcus, as an example, Home Depot, and others I know, numerous. But you know, I just -- it's hard to comment on somebody. He is an opponent. You have to be very sharp. I'm dealing with the heads of these countries. And every one of them is a world-class chess player. And if you are not 100 percent on your game, if you are not 100 percent sharp- plus, you've got a problem.I looked -- I looked at what we have in this country. I came in and I guessed it from before, but after I saw what was going on with horrible trade deals, horrible military deals, money being spent, it was being sent out like water. You see what I have done with NATO, $140 billion, but really much more than that. It increases every year where countries are now paying for what we are doing. It was so unfair.So many different things, I could go -- and you don't have enough time. I could go all night with it. But you have to be on your game. You have to be sharp. And you have to be tough. And if you are not, these guys are going to take you to the cleaner.And they will take you to the cleaners like you have never seen before. It is so easy. And he wasn't -- he wasn't the best in his heyday.Let's not kid ourselves. Everybody knows that. Everybody knows that. Senators will tell you that in his best he wasn't. But I see the statements he is making now. And I don't think he has much of a clue.HANNITY: Mr. President, when you spoke about canceling the convention in Jacksonville, you were very passionate about it today. And you said the timing is not right. And we knew there would be flare-ups. This virus is the worst since 1918. And you said today, I have to protect the American people. That is what I have always done. That is what I always will be -- will do, that's what I'm about. We can make this work easily.And you also reminded people the importance of masks. People say you haven't been as outspoken as maybe you should have been on masks. But there were people telling us, well-known experts, not to wear masks in March for crying out loud, and socially distancing.And the CDC just released last week that if people wear the masks, this thing could be gone in four to six weeks. And what can you add about therapeutics and what can you add about a potential vaccine? You mentioned Pfizer today.TRUMP: Well, you know, at the beginning, many people, many very respected people, I won't mention names, but many respected people were saying don't wear a mask, that they're bad. You touch your face too much, and you get your hands near your eyes and your nose and they are bad.And then all of a sudden, it was a big thing to get masks because I'm all for it. Look, whatever is going to help, if it was a five percent chance, a two percent chance, wear it. And I will wear it. I wore it at Walter Reed Hospital the other day.I went to the hospital. I visited soldiers that have been so badly injured in Iraq. And it is terrible, in Afghanistan -- I saw one that was so badly injured in Afghanistan.And, you know, we are largely -- we're down to a very small force in both places. We were serving as policemen over there. And we can police our own country, especially when you look at Chicago and you look at what is happening around our country. And, you know, we have done a lot. We have done a lot.But you have to -- we have to do -- we have to get our country back. We have to get rid of this horrible plague that hit us and it hit us hard. But it didn't just hit us. It hit the whole world, Sean.The whole world was hit. China allowed it to escape to Europe and to the whole world, including us. And they are suffering. There's tremendous -- you know, you don't see that too much in the news, but you have countries that are going through relatively what we are doing plus-plus-plus. It is horrible.And we make ventilators because we have become -- we have become the best in the world for the ventilators. We're making thousands a month. We are sending supplies all over. And we are in -- we are in great shape from the standpoint. But we have this thing that is very, very contagious. Nobody has ever seen anything like it. Very, very highly contagious.But if you take a look at a map, we have large sections of the country that are in great shape. And we are going to win. And we are going to win sooner rather than later. I will say this on the vaccines, we are doing well. We have the greatest companies in the world, including we are dealing with other nations. We are working very closely.And therapeutically, therapeutics are, I think, going to be fantastic. Frankly, I would like to have that first because you could go into the hospitals, give somebody a shot or do whatever you have to do, and they would get better right away. But we are doing very well therapeutically. And we are doing very, very well with vaccines.HANNITY: Well, we know new studies have come out, and I had Dr. Oz on my radio show this week, that hydroxychloroquine, used early with azithromycin and zinc, and you took a lot of heat over it, mortality rate cut in half according to the Ford study. He mentioned a local hospital, retrospective study in New York.Let me add, you tweeted out tonight: baseball is back. By the way, poor Dr. Fauci -- and I really do believe and people I think try to divide both of you, that he has tried his best. Dr. Birx has tried her best. All of the models and experts in many, many ways were so wrong. The one thing that remained consistent is the most vulnerable, the elderly, those with compromised conditions or immune systems and pre-existing conditions.So I ask you, you know, where are we with the vaccine, the therapeutics? How soon? And do you want every American, if they can't socially distance, to wear the mask? I selfishly want baseball and football to open so we can go. And I also want to protect grandmas and grandpas.TRUMP: I would like to see everybody, if they can't spread, if they can't have -- be socially distant, then I think they should probably put it on. And even if it's -- let's say it's a 50 percent chance or 25, because, again, people -- these same experts were saying, don't wear it, at one point. Now they're saying wear it. So let's go with them. What difference does it make?So let's say they're right and let's say there's a 50 percent chance or 25 percent chance, you're not going to lose with it. You're not going to lose with it. So do it.But, again, as I said, I really think you're going to have some answers very, very soon on therapeutics and also on vaccines. These companies, I'm dealing with them directly, I'm getting reports directly. They are very far advanced. They've already started testing. And what I have done is through the FDA, Dr. Hahn, and some great people, we have ramped it up to a level that nobody has ever seen speed like this.We could be two or three years out before we are doing what we are doing. We are already testing. We are actually doing the testing for vaccines and for therapeutics. That would have happened in a normal administration, I will say that that would have happened in two and three years from now.So we are way, way advanced. And I think you are going to have some very good answers very soon. They're going to come up with the answer.HANNITY: Mr. President, you are asking the American people in 103 days -- well, some will be voting early. By the way, I have information on my website hannity.com, early voting, how do you do absentee voting, who your congressperson is that's up for election. In 103 days, I say the American people, the ultimate jury. You are asking the American people for four more years. If you are given the four more years, what will this country look like, in your view, four years from now?TRUMP: So it's all going to be about America first. We always put other countries before us, which is so foolish and so horrible. And it has been so destructive for us. It's about America first. We will help other countries, but we want to take care of ourselves. We are going to be building factories. We are going to be bringing in shops like you've never seen. We were all set to do it until we got hit with the virus.Our troops will be home. The endless wars are already ending. Down to very few soldiers in -- as you know, in Afghanistan. Very few in Iraq. Syria is largely out except we kept the oil. We have oil there that we kept. I didn't want to leave the oil, we kept it. We took it over.We are going to be about jobs like you haven't seen. We are going to be respected. And we are now by other countries. They're respecting us more than they have in many, many decades. I will tell you that. We are going to have a wall that is complete. We're up to 257 miles on the new wall. And by the way, if we didn't have that wall in right now, you would have numbers in Texas and in California, in New Mexico like you wouldn't believe.But we built 257 miles of -- it's 450 but we are going to do about 537 miles altogether. And it will give a complete, beautiful wall on our southern border that has really helped.And the other thing is, we are going to start making our product. And I have been pushing this from before this happened. We are going to make things here. We will make them here. Right now China and many other countries are doing what we are supposed to be doing. They went, they became globalists, these great geniuses became globalists. And they really hurt our country.We are going to start making it here. As with Elon Musk, I said, Elon, build a factory in Texas. He just announced today they're building one of the biggest plants in the world, auto plant for Tesla, and it's going to be in Texas. And, you know, it's great. He called me up just a little while ago to say, I got it done. So that meeting, he got it done. But I was pushing that job very hard from Elon, because we work with him and we do a lot for him. And I said, it's time. And he was great. He's doing a good job.But the other thing we have done is Space Force. You know, we put it in, it's the first time in 76 years we have a new force. We have -- so important, the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, Coast Guard, and now we have the Air Force. It's so great. And it's so important. It's going to end up being one of -- at first, I didn't even talk about that on the campaign. This was after I got in office.I realized we need it. Because China and Russia were going to dominate space. And we can't let that -- and now we're going to be dominating space. They're not too happy about what we did with Air Force. But we have it. And -- with Space Force.So we have now Space Force, so important, and so many other things, Sean, regulation cuts, tax cuts, the biggest tax cuts in history, biggest regulation cuts in history. And we are going to continue that foreword. There are still many things we can do. But the bottom line is we are putting America first and we are making America better than it has ever been.You will see that. We are going to have a great year next year. We're going to have a great third quarter. And the nice thing about the third quarter is the results are going to come out before the election.HANNITY: You know, I've been saying to my audience on radio and TV that the biggest choice election in our lifetime. It's literally, you know, taxes higher or lower, deregulation, more regulation, law and order, lawlessness, amnesty or border security, judges, energy, trade, foreign policy, it seems like you are running against the team. And the team is Joe, Bernie, \"Bolshevik Bernie\" I call him, Bernie Sanders the socialist, AOC, Green New Deal, Beto, Schumer, Pelosi, so I think it is.I want to go back to baseball. You announced today you are going to throw out the first pitch at Yankee Stadium on August 15th. Dr. Fauci did not do too well tonight with the Nationals. Have you ever thrown out a first pitch before? Are you nervous about throwing out the first pitch? Derek Jeter once famously said I guess to George Bush after 9/11, if you bounce it, you are going to get booed.TRUMP: Yes, no, I have thrown out first pitches. I have agreed to do it for the Yankees on I think they are playing the Boston Red Sox. That is a great rivalry. And I will do it. It's great that baseball is back, and other sports are back. I hope everyone is standing. I hope they are not going to be kneeling when the flag is raised. I don't like to see that. That would hurt a lot of people in our country. They don't want to see that with the NFL or baseball or basketball or anything else. We want to -- there are plenty of places you can protest. You don't have to protest on the raising of our flag.So a lot of great things happening for our country. One other thing I want to say is, we have made incredible trade deals. And we are going to continue that along. Because we got taken to the cleaners by every country. Ally or non-ally, we were taken to the cleaners. And we will keep that going.HANNITY: Mr. President, Mark Meadows, your chief of staff, recently indicated that indictments could be imminent in the Durham probe. We have big breaking news tonight. I don't know if you saw the opening of the show, a document declassified by your director of national intelligence, John Ratcliffe, revealing the FBI agent who gave you that defensive briefing in August of 2016 used it as a cover to monitor you and Michael Flynn as it relates to Russia.Do you remember it? It also, I believe, puts Jim Comey in a position of being proven to have lied just like when he said to you at Trump Tower the dossier is salacious but unverified. But he swore that it was accurate and true when he signed the FISA application to spy on you and your campaign and take away Carter Page's rights. What is your reaction to this news? And your thoughts on where this probe with John Durham is going?TRUMP: Well, it's just more and more things that you see. And that's only what you see. It is really bad. It is a terrible thing that happened. It should never happen to another president. The fact is that President Obama and Vice President Biden, and the whole group of them with Brennan and Comey and McCabe and Lisa Page and Strzok, her lover, and beyond them, long beyond them, they spied on the campaign, using the intelligence agencies of our country, they illegally -- this is illegal as can be, this is treason, this is many things you can call it, they spied on the campaign of another party or presidential campaign.HANNITY: And the attorney general.TRUMP: Both before and after victory. Both before and after. Never been done before. It is so bad. If it were the other side, they would have been in jail for two years, and it would have been a 50-year term. But Obama and Biden knew everything, and they spied on the campaign of the opposing party, using intelligence.HANNITY: Do you -- well, this raises a question. Now we know what happened in the Oval Office on January 5th. Do you think that Barack Obama, the former president, Joe Biden, should have to answer for what we now know happened 15 days before your inauguration in the Oval Office? We have one minute, sir.TRUMP: That was just one meeting. There were many meetings. There was no way -- I understand the system very well, I understand being president very well, there was no way this could have gone out without -- gone down without President Obama knowing every single thing.And even Biden brought up the Logan Act with respect to General Flynn, a great gentleman who has been treated so horribly and still is. A lot of -- a lot of things have been learned. And what happened is a disgrace. Again, should never, ever happen to another president.HANNITY: Would you consider pardons for the people involved? In the last 15 seconds.TRUMP: I've looked at a lot of different people, they have been treated extremely unfairly, and I think I probably would, yes.HANNITY: Mr. President, thank you for your time. In 103 days, the American people will make the ultimate decision. Sir, we appreciate you always taking time for this audience. Thank you.TRUMP: Thank you very much, Sean. Thank you.HANNITY: All right. That's all the time we have left.

The President of the United States says enough is enough, it's time for the federal government to step in.In prime time tonight, I'm Harris Faulkner in for Martha MacCallum and this is \"The Story.\" Some of the most disturbing video is coming from Chicago. We got our first look at an incident from Friday. It's now being described as a coordinated ambush on police. Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot calling them violence vigilantes as they were hurling rocks an explosives.49 as police officers hurt including one who had his eye socket broken. Another who had his kneecap broken by thrown objects. We move now to the scene in Portland, Oregon. 53 days into the violence there. Criminals tried to light the court house on fire. Federal agents deployed tear gas in an attempt to force them back and the Mayor of Portland blames the unrest on the presence of federal agents and the person who sent them there, President Trump.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MAYOR TED WHEELER, D-OREGON: Your presence here is actually leading to more violence and more vandalism. We are all telling the Trump administration. Stop the rhetoric. Take these people out of our city. They are not helping us. They are hurting us and what we're seeing is a blatant abuse of police tactics by the federal government.(END VIDEO CLIP)FAULKNER: Top Democrats on Capitol Hill say they are alarmed and are calling for an investigation into the use of federal law enforcement. The President. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PRESIDENT DONALD J. TRUMP: More federal law enforcement, than I can tell you. In Portland, they did a fantastic job. They grabbed them, lot of people in jail. They're leaders.These are anarchists, these are not protesters and you ended up over the summer. This is worse than Afghanistan by far. This is worse than anything anyone's ever seen. All run by the same Liberal Democrats.(END VIDEO CLIP)FAULKNER: We have a big line up to tackle all of it tonight. DHS Acting Deputy Secretary Ken Cuccinelli on the federal government's plan to get the cities under control. Good to see you, Ken. Coming up. Congressman Jim Jordan, Ranking Member of the Committee that's now investigating all of this. Congressman, welcome.Plus analysis from two law enforcement experts, Dr. Cedric Alexander and Robert Harris, gentlemen, look forward to it. For now let's begin with our correspondent on the ground in Chicago - in Chicago tonight, Matt Finn with all that's happening right now.Matt, a busy day and night.MATT FINN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: And Harris, this new disturbing video reveals each step of a highly organized mob style attack against the Chicago police department at the base of this statue that's sent 18 officers to the hospital, one recovering this evening with a broken eye socket, the other a broken knee cap.Thousands of protesters Friday evening marching to tear down the Christopher Columbus statue. Rioters then blend in and popped up lots of umbrellas to shield their identities. Then a person drops off all types of weapons including frozen water bottles that were thrown at police, also rocks and explosives. CPD also says PVC pipe that was holding banners was intentionally sharpened and thrown at police.Today Chicago's top cop acknowledges, there were alleged incidents of brutality at that Friday riot and says they will be investigated but for now the police superintendent says all of his officers must wear their protective gear to all protest, going forward because it's not clear they're going to remain peaceful.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DAVID BROWN, CHICAGO POLICE SUPERINTENDENT: Chicago police does not want to engage in violent interactions with peaceful protesters. But when the law is being broken, or has been broken, our oath demands that we act. I understand the anger that is present in our city and in our nation. CPD is on the front lines of this anger.(END VIDEO CLIP)FINN: It was another bloody weekend here in Chicago police say between just the hours of 6:00 PM Friday and midnight last night, 12 people were killed, 63 people were shot in 41 shootings across the city and this weekend once again, children were shot here in Chicago.This time, a shooting injured cousins, two boys, ages 10 and 11.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PASTOR DONOVAN PRICE: Is Covid-19 the thing is going to kill our children or our each other going to be the thing that kills our children? Which pandemic is worse?(END VIDEO CLIP)FINN: And today Chicago's top cop says he welcomes any federal assistance, the President wants to send to this city. Harris.FAULKNER: Wow that Finn, that really resonated on such a visceral level. Which pandemic is worse? Thank you very much for getting us kicked off with that report. Department of Homeland Security Acting Deputy Secretary now, Ken Cuccinelli.Ken, when you hear that about what's going on in the streets and I know that you told The Washington Post that there will be a heavy presence now in Portland and other cities. What can we expect? What would that look like?KEN CUCCINELLI, ACTING DEPUTY SECRETARY, DHS: Well, when violence advances, the President has made it clear that he wants us to advance law enforcement to push it back, to bring peace back to these cities. We defend our federal facilities where we have people like the head of the police there in Chicago who want to cooperate with us.We are - we welcome that cooperation and we're happy to come help them do their job and achieve the peace that we all aspire to for their communities and you know, the clip you played of him. I couldn't have said it any better. I agree with every single word he said.You know, I wish we were seeing that in every city around the country who's having to take on these violent mobs.FAULKNER: You're talking about the Chicago Police Superintendent that we showed I think.CUCCINELLI: Yes ma'am.FAULKNER: You know Deputy Secretary, the Mayor of Portland says violence was improving there but then federal law enforcement made it worse. What - what's your response to that?CUCCINELLI: You know, that is a fake talking point. Look, we are literally at a point today where I think we're now over 50 straight days. 50.FAULKNER: 53.CUCCINELLI: 50 days of violence in Portland. 53. Thank you and we advanced an additional DHS law enforcement component only about two weeks ago so they were a 35-40 days into daily violence that this Mayor was encouraging. He wasn't discouraging it.Look at the simple - simple fact that he hasn't put a curfew on and enforced it. One of the simplest way is to bring peace to the streets of a city. He refuses to do it because he's politicizing the violence to his own political advantage while President Trump has put us there to try to help bring peace and order back to that part of the city where we have jurisdiction near the federal facilities.FAULKNER: All right, I want to talk with you about what that jurisdiction looks like and - and what I would call as a former military route, the rules of engagement here because I think that's really important. You know, you've got people accusing the federal agents on the ground of taking people off the streets, snatching them up and putting them in the backs of cars and putting something over their head.I want to speak to what the facts really are and - and what they're able to do, these federal agents.CUCCINELLI: Right, so in Portland just like everywhere else, our agents are identified as police on front and back and they have their unit identifiers on both shoulders so there are Customs Border Protection agents for instance. They're helping the federal protective service protect the federal buildings in Portland.So Customs Border Protection have police on the front, will have Customs Border Protection and Homeland Security seal on each shoulder and their unit identifier. These are board tack which is like a SWAT team and they have an individual identifier as well, not their name but a code identifier like AS3 or something like that, that's unique to them.They are always identifying themselves, including to the subject of some news this week, a viral video you seem to be alluding to. They identify themselves to that subject. They didn't identify themselves to the crowd who is shouting at them because they have no obligation to do that and frankly it distracts them from keeping themselves and the subject they're dealing with, safe during their interaction with such people.So very standard for us and we're going to continue to keep the presence there as long as the violence stays. If those violent criminals want us to leave or to reduce our presence, we're always there, have been since the court house and other buildings were built but if they want to see our presence reduced, then the violence really does need to come to an end.That's the point. We're not there because it's Portland, we're not there because of Mayor Wheeler. We're there because violent criminals are doing damage every day and threatening the federal presence that's already there in Portland.FAULKNER: And I'm clear on it but politics are playing a role because when the President talks about these cities, he talks about them with specificity being liberal and Democrat-led. Does that complicate the job you're on the ground doing?CUCCINELLI: Well look, I really believe that the years and years of liberal policies contribute. There's a reason there's violence in 50-year liberal enclaves and not in 50-year conservative enclaves. I mean this is - this is you know, I don't treat it politically Republican Democrat but policies and ideas matter and have consequences over a long time.This isn't new to Portland. Two years ago, the Mayor there, publicly withdrew the police from defending an ICE facility, a Department of Homeland Security facility in the middle of a siege. It was an invitation to violence and that's exactly what happened. So you know, we don't have much choice but to do our job and we're committed to doing our job.If the Mayor wants to try to get in the way and make that harder, he can make it harder by reducing cooperation. We prefer and seek cooperation with state and local officials all over the country and in most of the country, those are very productive relationships and where they exist, we have more peace and better law enforcement.FAULKNER: Well and - and just to wrap up with this point of fact. I interviewed the White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany today and she talks specifically about the two models that you're going forth with, one that is an operation based on cooperation and the other that is based on non-cooperation.A big job all around. 53 days of unrest in one of America's great cities. Thank you very much. I know it's a long time.CUCCINELLI: Harris, good to be with you.FAULKNER: Thank you very much for joining me. Thanks. Also here tonight, Republican Congressman Jim Jordan of Ohio. He's the ranking member on the House Judiciary Committee. Let's talk about where we are in terms of shoring up America's cities and what we can do from Capitol Hill?REP. JIM JORDAN, R-OHIO: Well, the Democrats you said earlier the Democrats are alarmed by a federal presence. The cops here want the federal presence. You heard that from the Police Chief in Chicago where 49 officers as you pointed out were attacked. So for goodness sakes, look, the Mayor of Portland said this was improving until the federal - this has been 53 days that they've done that.That's 7.5 weeks of rioting, looting, violence, attacks a police officer, destruction of property and - and they - they don't want any help. They just want to let this continue to happen to their constituents, to their business owners in the - in their city. I mean this is scary to me and the idea that this is somehow President Trump's fault.I mean we went back and checked Harris. You know the last time there was a Republican Mayor elected in Portland? 1956. I mean that that was long before you were born and it was even before I was born so this site - every - every day - every member of the city council in Portland, Democrat.No Republican so how was this a Republican problem. This is scary what's going on. What Democrat mayors, Democratic governors are allowing to happen to their cities, to their constituents is frightening and I know that these cops just like the police chief in Chicago said, the officers certainly like federal help there to have them deal with the situation that they've been countering now for 53 days in the city of Portland.FAULKNER: You know I am curious because it would seem that all of this started as a conversation that the nation was ready to have about police reform and we've gone far afield from that. I interviewed Senator Scott, Tim Scott on my special last night on all of this and you know, the thing that confuses me now as we get back to work and it's Monday, a fresh new week is that Democrats have said that they really want to put off that police reform and they want to put off a deeper conversation about you know, potentially making things different and better.How do you is a Republican on the Hill go forward with that? That's a lot of pressure on everybody if you have to sit with this scene, replicating over and over, where we dealt with one autonomous zone, then we had several.JORDAN: No, it's sad and Tim Scott, Senator Scott's done tremendous work and he truly wanted to get to a consensus, get to good legislation that helped protect law enforcement but also dealt with the situation, the tragedy that took place in Minneapolis and he had a good bill.We offered during the mark up on the House side in the Judiciary Committee, we offered on the Republican side 12 thoughtful good amendments. They didn't take a single one of them because this was about politics for the Democrats. That's the scary thing so I wish we could get to some real good legislation that helps - that helps police departments, helps these communities but they don't want to do it.I mean you think about this. They - they won't stop the rioting and the looting but they'll stop kids from going to school. They won't stop the rioting and the looting but they'll stop people from going to church. They won't stop the rioting and the looting, they'll stop people from attending a loved one's funeral.So for Democrats, this is everything and that's the scary thing and most Americans with just good common sense say what is going on. It is time for this to end. It is time to quit the blaming and step up as Democrat mayors, Democrat governors in these respective states and cities to step up and take responsibility and stop it and hold people accountable for the wrong doing that they are seeing and doing every single day.FAULKNER: You know it's interesting, we're seeing people get on the same page among the citizenry and we don't want to break everything around race and culture but I just bring this Fox news poll to mind from earlier today. Blacks and whites are based on the same 80 and 81 percent on the issue of law and order and what's happening in our streets today.JORDAN: Of course.FAULKNER: That the critical nature. We are in it together.JORDAN: Yes, we sure are.FAULKNER: Congressman Jordan, thank you very much for your time and your perspective.JORDAN: Thank you Harris. You bet. Take care.FAULKNER: I want to - thanks. Let's bring in Dr. Cedric Alexander now. Former President of the National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives and Robert Harris, Director of the Los Angeles Police Protective League. Gentlemen, thank you for being here. I wanted to come together with both of you because I've had deep conversations about how we get to moving forward with both of you. Dr. Alexander, I'll start with you. Chicago, black on black crime. That was not caused by George Floyd. It's another summer of discontent, doesn't even touch it, it is destruction and it is soul destroying, what's going on with the murder in the streets there.DR. CEDRIC ALEXANDER, FORMER PRESIDENT, NATIONAL ORGANIZATION OF BLACK LAW ENFORCEMENT EXECUTIVES: Yes so let me speak to Chicago as many other cities, large cities across this country but more specifically to Chicago is that what we're seeing is not new to Chicago. This has been going on long before Mayor Lightfoot got there, long before Rahm Emanuel got here.It is been in that system there for a long time and it goes beyond quite frankly being just a police problem. You're talking to someone who is a Chief twice in this country in two cities in this country and I think the police do the very best they can with the resources they are given but I think we all also have to admit, there's bigger issues that exist in some of those communities where we see this high volume of crime that continues to occur, year after year after year after year.It put good residents in those communities at risk and it puts our police officers at risk as well so we got to have a much broader conversation beyond policing as how we begin to resolve some of those issues and I think it's a - it's really just not a Chicago problem, it's an American problem that we all are going to have to confront but let me say one more thing here before I end here also Harris.Is that for me, this is not going to be a Right or a Left kind of discussion in which I'm going to have. This is about what's right and what's wrong and what we as a nation are going to have to do if we want to make systemic change.FAULKNER: Yes.ALEXANDER: But one side of the aisle blaming the other side of the aisle is just politics that don't amount to anything while people are losing lives and police officers are at risk.FAULKNER: You know Robert Harris, as we look at the video that's come in today from the middle part of the country from Portland and other places, do you think it's time for federal help? You know, you've led many - you've been a police officer so when do you as an officer say yep, we need that help?ROBERT HARRIS, DIR, LA POLICE PROTECTIVE LEAGUE: Well first, I just want to agree with the doctor in that bullets do not care about political affiliation, they just don't and I think a path forward here is to take a page out of our rank and file playbook in that here in Los Angeles, some officers I believe are the most professional in the country and we work collaboratively, consistently with our federal partners, with our other adjacent local jurisdictions.And I think some of our political leaders could really take a cue from that. I think the path forward is finding people who can exercise some ownership over where we're at instead of blaming, instead of looking at law enforcement as a political football and bring the key stakeholders to the table which in my opinion is the Los Angeles Police Protective League in rank and file unions because we represent those who are out there every day, trying to make a difference and who recognize that professionalizing our profession is a positive thing for everybody involved.FAULKNER: You know, I listened to what you're saying and I think Gosh, don't we thirst on Capitol Hill for emergency hearings at this point. And look, you know, I get it. They probably have to be virtual. Look how good you guys look on TV. It's virtual. We can get it done.But when you're going - when you're talking about pulling all these people together, we - we need to do that and also pull some from the streets so we understand where they're coming from because they're not organized, that group. We can't assume we know. Robert Harris, Dr. Cedric Alexander, thank you for your time tonight.ALEXANDER: Thank you for having me.HARRIS: Thank you Harris.FAULKNER: President Trump is not buying this polling. The polls show him trailing Joe Biden, many of them. National Press Secretary for Trump 2020 Hogan Gidley will join me next on that. Stay close.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CHRIS WALLACE, FOX NEWS HOST: Mr. President, you'll be happy to know that Fox news has a new poll out today and you're going to be the very first person to hear about it. In the National horse race Joe Biden leads you by 8 points, 49 percent to 41. I understand. We still have more than 100 days to this election but at this point you're losing.TRUMP: First of all, I'm not losing because those are fake polls. They were fake in 2016 and now they're even more fake. The polls were much worse in 2016.(END VIDEO CLIP)FAULKNER: That of course the President of the United States, dismissing the notion that he has fallen behind in the 2020 race against Joe Biden despite the latest Fox news polls showing the former Vice President pulling ahead by 8.But I asked the team to pull some more, you know like getting a bit on a home, you want at least three. So here are a couple more. The NBC news Wall Street journal poll has Biden up by 11. The ABC News Washington Post says it's more like 15 and to be fair, the Rasmussen poll is up by three on the low end so you've got a little bit of a mix here.Here now to respond, Hogan Gidley is National Press Secretary for Trump 2020. Hogan, thanks for joining me tonight. No matter where you go, the polling is not positive for President Trump and we have in you a mix. You just left the White House now and leadership on the campaign. How is this resonating, do you figure in both places?HOGAN GIDLEY, NATIONAL PRESS SECRETARY, TRUMP 2020: Well first of all, the President's absolutely right. Those polls are fake. For example in 2016, in the exit polling Fox polled 36 percent Democrats. The poll that Chris Wallace just referenced, is 46 percent Democrat. It's a 10 percent increase of who they actually look at in poll and of course elections at the end of the day come down to choices. We know we're in great shape with the American people because when you look at what Donald Trump will do with safety and security and protecting the American family, protecting our way of life, we're in great shape.When you compare and contrast that with the choice of Joe Biden, someone who when asked is it OK if we redirect funds away from the police, he says yes, absolutely. That's a big problem for the Left. It's a big problem for Democrats and I understand the media is doing a really good job covering for Joe Biden saying, no redirect doesn't mean defund the police.If that's the case, let me propose something to you Harris if I may, your next paycheck, I'm not going to defund it, I'm just going to redirect some of that money into my account. Everyone knows that's a cut and that's what Joe Biden wants to do. It will leave our American families vulnerable.It will leave our communities less safe. This president has done everything to protect them to this point. He'll do so in the next four years.FAULKNER: Interesting. You know as I'm looking at these polls and I'm just going to run back over on because you mentioned Democrats in the polling and you're right about that, about the percentages of the ones that we named. Quinnipiac, not the case. The Hill, not the case and certainly Rasmussen and while the numbers may not be as great between these two men as you look at the margin of error, they're still negative for the President.So what are you concentrating on because when - when you walk past, the President did well. Seven points in 2016 above Hillary Clinton and independents and you know and digging deep in this, because you're looking at how many Democrats are participating in them, that you've got a little bit of a problem.You've got the softness in independents so what do you do about that?GIDLEY: Well - well, a couple of things. Again, the methodology of those polls that you're talking about now, the same methodology that got it wrong in 2016 but you don't have to guess how the economy would look under Joe Biden. We just saw it for seven years. Depressed wages, 3.5 million jobs going to China, horrible trade deals that gutted the American middle class, kicked the American workers square in the teeth.Compare and contrast that with Donald Trump. 7 million jobs coming into this country, manufacturing plants relocating. Also you saw 500,000 of those manufacturing jobs that they said on the Left would never come back, he brought them back. You don't have to guess what Joe Biden would do with our city streets.As I said, when the lawlessness broke out, he was completely silent except when he did pop up out of his hidey hole. He made the point, hey yes, let's defund the police so let's be clear. Your jobs aren't safe. Your families aren't safe and your American way of life is not safe with Joe Biden because through his policies, he's waged war for the last 50 years on all three.FAULKNER: Well, and with Democrats, they may be handing you a bit of a gift politically by saying they don't even want to tackle the police reform until 2021 when they hope to win majorities again. Look, I want to move on to something that the President said about if he were not to be re-elected. Let's watch. I'm curious to know what he meant by this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: I think mail-in voting is going to rig the election, I really do.WALLACE: Are you suggesting that you might not accept the results of the election?TRUMP: I have to see.WALLACE: Can you give a direct answer, you will accept the election.TRUMP: I have to see. Look, I have to see. I'm not going to just say yes. I'm not going to say it and I didn't last time either.(END VIDEO CLIP)FAULKNER: Hogan, you were in the church with me with the President as I interviewed him last month.GIDLEY: That's right.FAULKNER: And I asked him a similar question. He said that he would accept whatever the results were. What changed?GIDLEY: Well, if it's done properly, of course but the fact is as the President pointed out so articulately there. The Democrats are pushing for universal mail-in voting. That's just fraught with all types of possibility for cheating and the Democrats know it.So they're bragging about a policy that could completely compromise an election and then they're asking us to abide by those results. That's ridiculous and let's also note, we're talking about a Democrat party here who solve the intelligence about Russia meddling into the election and did nothing about it. It was Donald Trump who stood up for the integrity of the election system by bringing in the NSC, the FBI, the CIA to work with states and locales to make sure every vote mattered and every vote was counted. Those are the facts of the case.And after that election in 2016 it was the Democrats who went on an attack against this president like we've never seen before. Perpetrating an entire Russia hoax, they were the ones who continue to say to this day that it was Hillary Clinton who won the election. They are still saying Stacey Abrams is the duly elected governor of Georgia.They are the ones that have a problem standing up for the results of an election, but we won't take a lesson from them on that and we're sure not going to say right now that whatever happens, we are just going to say that's the way it is, because we know now that Democrats have a history of cheating and elections and we're not going let them cheat on this one.If this election is free and this election is fair, Donald Trump will get four more years in the White House.FAULKNER: Well, and then there is one thing that no one can guess, and that is how COVID-19 will play a role in how people choose to vote. We'll cover it all. Hogan Gidley, great to see you tonight. Thank you.GIDLEY: Thanks so much, Harris. I appreciate it.FAULKNER: Today in Florida, 10,000 new coronavirus cases, a rising death toll, and now some are suggesting reinstating the lockdown. It might be the only way out of this, they say.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)FAULKNER: COVID-19 cases continuing to rise in the State of Florida, there is one particular area that is more alarming to all of the experts, Miami- Dade County is now being referred to by many as the epicenter of this disease right now. With more than 23,370 new cases just last week, 170 people died.The ICU's have been filled for days. And now there is fear that another massive lockdown might be the only way to slow down COVID-19.Joining me now, the mayor of Miami-Dade County, Carlos Gimenez. Good to see you tonight, Mayor. Thanks for joining me.So, some criticism is coming your way with how the reopening was handled. And I'm curious, because you had to wait according to federal guidelines for a 14-day decreasing COVID-19 before reopening, did you wait that period of time?MAYOR CARLOS GIMENEZ, R-MIAMI-DADE COUNTY, FLORIDA: Yes, we met all the what's called the gating criteria, our positivity rate was below -- was below 10 percent for 14 days, and so, yes, we had the green flag to open it, and we also opened it where the advice -- on the advice of our medical advisors.We have like a 200-page document on how to open all the regulations and all the businesses had to go through. Our people had to wear masks on interior spaces. Outdoors they had to wear a mask unless they could maintain a distancing of six feet.What happened was sometime around June, a lot of the people stopped abiding by some of these rules and we saw young people especially start to reengage, re-go out social partying, and all of that. And then we had the demonstrations. And so, all those things.(CROSSTALK)FAULKNER: What young people do.GIMENEZ: Exactly, what people -- young people doing what young people do, and that actually is the -- we saw spike in the middle of June, it was all young people, 18 to 34, 35 to 45-year-olds, and then that then led to a contagion in the general population, and that's what we see today.FAULKNER: How frustrating is it to know that the good hard work of your citizens there was not may be completely unraveled, but certainly damaged in terms of what you have to do next? So, you've the ICUs full, what will you do if hospitals start to reach capacity? Like you're not going in that good direction again, so what are you going to do?GIMENEZ: Well, we are seeing a slow down on the speed up, let's put it that way. It's not -- we're not seeing --FAULKNER: OK.GIMENEZ: -- the hospitalizations rising at the same rate, we are seeing tapering down. We have instituted a curfew a couple of weeks ago. We close down some of the assemblies like casinos and movie theaters, and all of that. Bars have never been opened here. We close down the interior spaces of restaurants.And so, our medical advisors say, hey, let's see what those measures take, also re-emphasize the wearing of masks, now masks are mandatory inside and outside. Re-emphasize that and then enforcement.And so, we passed an ordinance, you know, last week that allows for civil penalties, not just criminal penalties for not abiding with the rules, and so far, we've shot some businesses down, we've also given some tickets. So, it's reinforcing the rules, the good rules that we put in place --FAULKNER: So --GIMENEZ: -- a couple of months ago that if people just would have followed, we wouldn't be where we are today.FAULKNER: So, Mayor, you know, I have to look at this, now you're going to depend on the police to shore up all of this. That's a lot on them, and especially when you look across the country with what police officers are going through to start writing tickets for that.GIMENEZ: Right.FAULKNER: But that's obviously what you think you need to do. Let's talk statewide, the largest teacher's union in Florida is now suing the state over safety concerns for kids going back to school. What is your plan for schools in your area?GIMENEZ: I'm working with the superintendent and we're working on a plan whether at the time six weeks from now, whether it will be safe to open up schools or not. We're not going to put kids in an unsafe environment, we're also look, going to look at the science and what it does, but the superintendent and I are working very closely together on that.FAULKNER: All right.GIMENEZ: We're going to have different plans depending on where this virus is at that time, and then we'll make that determination when the time comes.FAULKNER: Really quickly before I let you go, let's take a look at the hecklers --GIMENEZ: Sure.FAULKNER: -- who were yelling shame on you to your state Governor DeSantis at a presser today, should Florida follow one of the set rules? With the stress on the state be eased if DeSantis implemented a statewide mask mandate? Would that make it easier? We'll keep this video up. I'm just curious to get your thoughts on that, do you need help from the state from the top down?GIMENEZ: No, not really. I think, you know, we, in our tri-county area we have the mask order, it's the Dade, Broward, and Palm Beach has a -- and also Monroe has a mask order. The governor has allowed us a certain amount of autonomy here. It's different in southeast Florida than it is in other parts of the state.And so, look, it's even different inside Miami-Dade County then it is, you know, in other parts of Dade County.FAULKNER: Yes.GIMENEZ: Right? And so we have rural areas, we have urban areas. And so, you know, I -- the governor has been nothing but supportive of the efforts that we've had down here. He sent additional personnel to our hospitals. He sent additional resources to Miami-Dade County. So, I can't be anything but appreciative of the work that Governor DeSantis has done here for Miami- Dade.FAULKNER: Well, I'm broadcasting from New Jersey, and New York and my state led the world who know at one point in terms of the --GIMENEZ: Yes.FAULKNER: -- the rate at which we were going, you can turn it around.GIMENEZ: Yes.FAULKNER: Blessings to you and your county and your state.GIMENEZ: Thank you, thank you very much. God bless you.FAULKNER: Absolutely.Texas Senator Ted Cruz is warning his state, 2020 has a bull's-eye on it. And if Democrats win Texas, it's all over. Senator Ted Cruz is here next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)FAULKNER: Senator Ted Cruz of the great state of Texas has issued a new warning to his fellow Republicans just this week that the 2020 race is real in the lone star state. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. TED CRUZ, R-TEXAS: In Texas, the stakes are especially high. Texas is the single biggest target for the left in 2020, politically speaking. The 38 electoral votes at stake. That's a U.S. Senate seat at stake, and Texas is the key, it's a national domination for years to come. If the Democrats win Texas, it's all over.(END VIDEO CLIP)FAULKNER: Well, the last time Texas went for a Democrat was Jimmy Carter back in 1976. However, now a growing number of polls show President Trump neck and neck with Joe Biden there. Seeing a potential opening the Biden campaign has begun running its own ads across the state. And the latest Real Clear Politics average of polls shows President Trump up by fewer than a half point in Texas.Joining me now, Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas. Great to see you tonight. Thank you.CRUZ: Harris, good evening. Thank you for having me. And by the way, congrats on your big show last night.FAULKNER: Thank you very much. We got into it on how to take America forward. I appreciate that.CRUZ: Good.FAULKNER: Look, you know, when you look at it, it doesn't seem like Texas would go Democrat, I mean, what are you reading and saying, yes, alarm bells?CRUZ: Well, if you look at what's happening nationally, there are two broad demographic trends going on nationally, blue-collar workers, union members are moving right, and that's moving midwestern states more Republican, states like Ohio and Michigan and Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, every one of which went for Donald Trump in 2016.But at the same time, we're seeing suburban voters, in particular suburban women who are moving left. And that's moving states with big suburban population. States like Georgia and Texas and Arizona, all of them are becoming much, much more purple. And that's a real challenge, because with a state like Texas we know that New York and California are bright blue for the foreseeable future. If Texas joins them, that's the entire election. We can't let that happen.FAULKNER: So, two things, I'm going to ask our team to put up that headline from the Dallas morning news. Because we can speak to exactly what the senator is talking about. It's the headline, suburban women voters key to Democratic revival in Texas. They'll put it up eventually. But I -- there it is.I want to get your idea about how you reach those suburban women. You don't just throw in the towel at this point, so what's the strategy?CRUZ: Well, and it's important to mention, you know, a lot of the media coverage suggests that what's going on in Texas is racial or ethnic and it's based on the growing Hispanic number of voters. The data don't back that up that many of the Hispanics in Texas are quite conservative.Every time I have run in Texas I've gotten well over 40 percent of the Hispanic vote and that is despite running as an unapologetic conservative fighting to secure the border, build a wall, and stop amnesty.So, it's not the demographic piece on racial and ethnic lines. It's rather, I think the media have done a very good job of frightening -- painting a very scary picture with suburban women of the president. And you know, on one level, this election shouldn't be close.If you look at how extreme today's Democrats are, they're embracing socialism, even a month ago if I had come on your show, Harris, and if I had said, the Democrats are going to argue for abolishing the police, you would've said hold on there, that's a little bit crazy, and that's where they are.And given that, this election should be a slam-dunk, but unfortunately, I think the media is doing a very aggressive job of trying to convince a lot of voters who may not be paying all that close attention to this election that Trump --(CROSSTALK)FAULKNER: Yes --CRUZ: -- and the rights are kind of scary and violent, and wouldn't it be easier going with Uncle Joe just sitting in his basement? Isn't that a simpler calmer vision? And I've to say given how radical and extreme the voices are that the Democratic Party is letting go in their party, I don't think it would be calmer at all, but I think it's incumbent on us to make that case.FAULKNER: All right. Here is Joe Biden making his case to the state of Texas.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOE BIDEN, D-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I'm thinking all of you today across Texas, and though the rising case numbers is causing fear and apprehension, the virus is tough, but Texas is tougher.(END VIDEO CLIP)FAULKNER: So, Senator Cruz, today's polling, Fox News poll looked at what was most important to voters across the country, not specific to Texas. But 29 percent said COVID-19, and actually other things were below it like the economy. So, he hits that in your state --CRUZ: Yes.FAULKNER: -- and what do you say?CRUZ: Listen, I think those ads are effective. And by any measure, 2020 has been a hellish year.FAULKNER: Yes.CRUZ: Nobody started this year on New Year's Day predicting a global pandemic, the Great Depression, and race riots. I mean it's horrific what's happening to our country. And I think Biden and the Democrats are very smartly trying to capitalize on it. And what he, Biden is doing there in soft focus is say harken back to a calmer, peaceful time.That is a dangerous message. That's a compelling message pretty and I think that it's important if this election focuses on issues, if it focuses on substance, if it focuses on a contrast between free enterprise and socialism, and a contrast between the Constitution and Bill of Rights and rule of law versus anarchy and violence, we win it, but if it is a personality contest, that's what the Democrats want it to be because they think they win that election.FAULKNER: Senator Ted Cruz, thank you very much for your time tonight. Always good to see you.CRUZ: Always a pleasure.FAULKNER: Up next, the NFL training camp set to start next week, are the players going to show up? I caught a tweet by Patrick Mahomes. He's waiting for the COVID-19 plan. Football stars have launched a Twitter blitz to demand stricter coronavirus safety measures.Former NFL player Burgess Owens is with me. We love to go back and forth. Stay close.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)FAULKNER: The NFL has to move quickly to make an official decision about the 2020 season. Players are already starting to return to training camp this week. However, as COVID-19 cases continue to spike, a fall without football is looking like a very real possibility and that possibility is putting players at odds with the league.Here's an example, quarterback Drew Brees tweeted this. We need football. We need sports. We need hope. I'm not just showing it to you, he's using all exclamation points. It's that simple, get it done, NFL. He writes.Donovan Smith left-tackle for Tampa Bay wrote, risking my health, as well as my family's health does not seem like a risk worth taking.Here now Super Bowl champ turn candidate for Congress, Burgess Owens is with me. Great to see you, Burgess.BURGESS OWENS, FORMER NFL PLAYER: Harris, same here.FAULKNER: So where do you put this, do they play or not?OWENS; Well, I think what's unfortunate, these young men have a, they have a concern which is legitimate. I think the problem is you have a corporate activist unfortunately spending more time over the last few months trying to figure out how to give black people a separate anthem and actually dividing the American people and just getting down to what we need to get down.You know, it's a shame that you have an organization like the Disney World who has figured it out, small business owners around the country have figured this out. And you have Goodell -- Goodell who is not being -- or sit down and really think through how can he make sure his players are safe and the American people come together and do something that we've always enjoyed politics free which unfortunately these corporate activist don't believe in that, and that's what we are seeing the results of.FAULKNER: These are supreme athletes like yourself. Patrick Mahomes, OK, yes, I'm a Chiefs fan. But look, they won the Super Bowl, MVP players. Their health and well-being, their bodies are everything to them. So how do you make them comfortable and is there really enough time to do that now? Maybe you skipped the preseason?OWENS: Well, this is the thing. You know, it's not a surprise that fall is going to come and football season would eventually show up again.FAULKNER: It's not a --(CROSSTALK)OWENS: And I'll tell you. Right. These young men, this is their season, this is their zone. They want to play. They want to get paid. At the same time, they understand they have families they want to make sure that they're safe. These conversations should have been --FAULKNER: Yes.OWENS: -- should have been had a long time ago. So, we're at this point will they have a plan, a program set up. And they -- and everybody can play comfortable to go out there and play the game.But again, when you're lacking leadership, when you have people in this case, the commissioner who is focused on more things than the players and the fans, you get this kind of result of just being able to be looked at very helpless (Ph). It's unfortunate for everybody that he's not taking the control he should have by this time.FAULKNER: All right, you sort of passed on that you think that the black national anthem, the changing team's names and all that kind of a distraction. But they are a focal point for some teams like the Washington Redskins. I want to know your topline thought on changing the logo and the name there.OWENS: Well, my concern is that where does it stop? We have to understand that the people that, you know -- first of all, 90 percent of the American Indians have no problem with this name. And so, it's not -- it's those folks behind the scenes that's trying to actually continue to divide us.We have a great history. We have a history we should be not only engage with but be proud of as we learn how far we've come along the way. But we have the left that is actively trying to destroy our history, destroy anything we can come together with. And that's why we have to be concerned about. Where does it end? And we have no idea where it ends because progressive -- progressive people will continue to embrace progressive move forward and a leftist way. And that's what they have to do (Inaudible) unfortunately.FAULKNER: Football is supposed to be an escape. It's supposed to not be part of politics and all those things so we'll have to see what happens this fall and if we can just play ball.Burgess Owens, great to have you on the program tonight.OWENS: Thank you, Harris.FAULKNER: Thank you.OWENS: All the best.FAULKNER: Well, that's going to do it for me filling in for my friend, Martha MacCallum.

I'm Jesse Watters, along with Greg Gutfeld, Juan Williams, Dana Perino, and Kennedy. It is 5:00 in New York City, and this is The Five. President Trump ripping into Democrats and calling out the Supreme Court after a pair of his decisions on taxes, the high court ruling the president does not have absolute immunity from prosecution, and that a New York district attorney can subpoena his tax returns. And then a separate case, the Supreme Court blocking House Democrats from getting their hands-on Trump's financial records for now. Both of those cases are being thrown back to lower courts. Here is the president's reaction. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: This is a political witch hunt the likes of which nobody has ever seen before. it's a pure witch hunt. It's a hoax just like the Mueller investigation is a hoax that I won. And this is another hoax. This is purely political. I win at the federal level, and we won very decisively and so they sent it in to New York. And you know what's going on in New York. Everyone is leaving. It has turned out to be hell hole. And they better do something about it because People are leaving New York. it's a political witch hunt that just continues. (END VIDEO CLIP) WATTERS: And Nancy Pelosi responding to the rulings by vowing to keep investigating the president. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA): We have a path that the Supreme Court has laid out that we certainly will not ignore. And we will never stop our oversight. This isn't so much about the president's records, although we would like to know, you know, how Russia funded his operation all those years. But that's not what is at stake. What is at stake is the president above the law. (END VIDEO CLIP) WATTERS: All right. Kennedy, here is what I don't like about this. They are going to get their hands on these tax returns, and then they're just going to leak them. And then you are back to the whole Russia thing where these mysterious people are leaking things. You don't know if it's true or not. And then it just spins up a lot of fake news and speculation. It's pretty unfair. LISA KENNEDY MONTGOMERY, FOX NEWS HOST: Well, it's interesting because I think more information is better. I would like to see everyone's tax returns who wants to be the most powerful person in the world. I don't have a problem with that. I do have a problem with the overt politicization. And that's what the Supreme Court blocked today. And they made note that this is what the framers wanted to make sure didn't overtake the branches of government. And they didn't want the Congress to be able to hectare (ph) the president with superfluous requests. And so they did block that. But also what you have to see here is, you know, this was not a slim majority. This was a 7-2 ruling in two cases that were lumped together here. And Gorsuch and Kavanaugh were two Justices that although they agreed with the majority opinion, they also made note that the president should have some claims to block certain requests in the lower court. And, you know, to your point about leaking the process through the lower courts now may take so much time that if the president is worried about these things being known before the November election. Because it's going back and has a restart, that may be politically favorable to him. WATTERS: Juan, why do guys you have to keep hectoring the president with superfluous requests? JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS HOST: Well, you know, at first, I just want to say I thought Kennedy was on target overall. I mean, the key thing here for the president in the short term is that his taxes will not likely be out in public before the November election. So in the short term, I think, you know, although we saw him with his hands across his chest looking very defensive and talking about Obama and the witch hunts. I think if you're looking at it politically, Jesse, he really came out on top in terms of the Congress not having immediate access to the records. But in the long term, I think the big ticket here is that you have a conservative Supreme Court saying very clearly that in terms of prosecution, in terms of investigation, that the president is not above the law. That everybody, every American, including the president, has to respond to legal subpoenas and actions in that regard. And I think that's something that goes beyond the political moment, goes beyond. The president said he was -- could not be investigated, couldn't be prosecuted, could shoot a man on Fifth Avenue. He even said he could pardon himself. Well, here is a Supreme Court saying that's not the case, Mr. President. No kings around here. WATTERS: I don't know if that's exactly what the ruling stated, but that's neither here nor there. Dana, how do you see this SCOTUS ruling? DANA PERINO, FOX NEWS HOST: It's hard for me to see anything because you are not wearing a tie and I don't understand why. WATTERS: It's a long story. I don't have enough time to get into all of that. PERINO: I'm so thrown off that I am flabbergasted. OK, so this decision might have been a huge bang to the end of the Supreme Court session. Instead, it's just a little bit of a whimper. And that's because of all of the things that have already been said. Te White House press secretary today in her briefing, she described the decisions as a win for the president. And I thought that that was -- I thought it was skilful the way that she handled those questions. And also, she is a lawyer, so it really helps. And I think that that was the best way to do it. And I would not talk about this much more because this is not going to happen before the election. What did this insure is that there's going to be a lot more litigation going forward. What Andy McCarthy and John Yu (ph), two intellectual legal scholars that we all listen to, one of the things they said is it might be a political win for the president today. But it was a drastic, terrible decision for the presidency, the office of the presidency. Because going forward, this basically means that any U.S. attorney that wants to basically drag any sitting president into court is going to be allowed to do so. So there is some caution there. But I think overall for the president, I -- not a bad day. WATTERS: Yeah. I mean, Greg, you have told me in the greenroom many times that's one of the reasons you're not running for the presidency because you just don't want to have your taxes exposed to the American people. You have a very complex tax return. And you just don't want Americans to see that. GREG GUTFELD, FOX NEWS HOST: Yeah. There are a lot of unusual medical deductions that I take. And it would just confuse the public. By the way, Dana, I will tell you why Jesse is not wearing a tie, great news. They are rebooting Falcon Crest. And Jesse is playing Lorenzo Lamas' role. I think his name was Lance Cumson. (CROSSTALK) GUTFELD: Please do. Please do. (CROSSTALK) GUTFELD: We don't see enough of that manly chest. PERINO: I'm so distracted. (CROSSTALK) WATTERS: I will button it back up. GUTFELD: Yes. There you go. Here's the deal. I will make two points. The fact is Trump won the presidency. He was given -- and we know this. But he was choice beforehand. Release your taxes and potentially, potentially muck up the campaign. Don't release them. And if you lose, nobody cares. And if you win, great, you won and we can deal with that problem later about not releasing the taxes. So this is very smart strategy from 2016 to just say let's just see what happens. Now, it also pays to point out what energizes the media. They are always consumed by any potential avenue of muck regarding people who don't share their assumptions. So everybody becomes a Woodward and Bernstein around the people they hate. But imagine if the media had been this energized about Harvey Weinstein 10 years ago or Jeffrey Epstein 10 years ago of the decay of Democratic cities, 20, 30 years ago or just recently, the scandalous rest home deaths or baby Hunter Biden's enriching himself off his dad. Or who push the Steele dossier? I mean, we haven't heard about the Steele dossier, the Clinton-funded author of it. Christopher Steele has been ordered to pay damage on the dossier lies. So the bottom line here is media bias isn't always about the stories that the media chases. It's the stories they pretend that don't exist. WATTERS: That's a good point. So why doesn't the president maybe just acid wash his returns, because that's what Hillary did and no one really seemed to care. GUTFELD: There you go. WATTERS: Sleepy Joe Biden now ripping off one of Trump's signature campaign promises. Greg has a monologue on that next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) GUTFELD: You know what makes me sick, all this America first crap from Donald Trump. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: When the federal government spends taxpayers' money commit, we should use it to buy American products and support American jobs. During my first term alone, we will invest $400 billion. The products and materials our country needs to modernize our infrastructure. (END VIDEO CLIP) GUTFELD: Wait, wait, wait. Did he just say use it to buy American products? I wonder where he got that idea. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: In my administration, we live by two simple rules. Buy American and hire American. Buy American and hire American. Buy American and hire American. I've been saying buy American ever since I announced I was running for office and long before that. (END VIDEO CLIP) GUTFELD: True. Well, maybe that wasn't such a bad idea after all, Mr. Trump, another one of those nasty (ph) moments when he turns out to be right all along. Just wait until Biden asks for a wall. So the rest of us have caught up to Trump. For example, we now realize China is engaging in war against America. And it's not a cold one but a sleek lab built hot war that destroys an economy and disrupts political life with a weapon more modern than a bomb. And minus the messy retaliation, but I thought Joe was known for sticking to his guns. I mean, it was just days ago that he was barely able to say this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BIDEN: This guy's whole idea of America -- America on its own has been America alone. We are out there by ourselves. (END VIDEO CLIP) GUTFELD: How can you not remember the second word in America first? And Sorry, Joe, creating a policy that stresses buying American goods over not American goods is actually putting America first. But I get it. He's got a lot on his mind. Plus, it's all covered with plugs. I mean, what does Lonnie know? (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BIDEN: Lonnie knows -- I believe this every fiber of my being. We're posed -- what I propose is it can be done. I think we are in a position to really make it happen. And my team and your team are already working closely together to light up the path forward here. Critical laws like the pro- actors, collective bargaining. On politics like prevailing and -- look, yes, I'm getting -- I'm taking too much time. (END VIDEO CLIP) GUTFELD: Yes, you are. I have no idea what he just said. Love or hate Trump, his sentences actually connect two dots often loudly. But Joe's words are just like Joe, always in danger of wandering off into the woods. But maybe that's the strategy. You can't criticize what cannot be deciphered. So text Joe at 1-888 -- I forgot the rest. Where's my soup? So Jesse, you once said that why should you vote for Joe Biden if Joe Biden is going to be a Trump light? Is this is an example of him being Trump-like? WATTERS: Yeah. I mean, he plagiarized buy American, hire American basically. It wouldn't be the first time Joe Biden plagiarized in politics. But I don't care. I think it's actually great that both candidates from both parties have a more economic, nationalist, populist approach to the U.S. economy. So if Biden moves to the right on this, good. It moves the conversation in the right direction because this is where the conversation is going. It's going to be a less multilateral world. We're going to have more of a kind of a gunboat mercantilism, if you guys know what I'm talking about, where we're going to protect our own shipping with our own Navy and not protect the entire world's free trade with our Navy. Those days are over. The cold war is kind of crumbling. And we are kind of getting back to American first. And Trump was right about it. Now, Joe is going far left on the environment, and he's gone far left on the de-fund police. So I honestly don't know where Joe is at any given moment, and neither does he. GUTFELD: Lorenzo dropping the mercantile in the response. Juan, so now we have two Republicans running for president. That's got to be good news. WILLIAMS: Right. You can't say that he's (INAUDIBLE) left wing. But here's my take on this. You know, President Trump's ratings are pretty low right now. They've gone down. But the one area in which he still polls very well and gets the approval of the American people in his ability to handle economic issues. People see him as someone who can do that. And I think Joe Biden and his campaign are speaking to that strength right now in saying, well, let's look at manufacturing. Let's look at mining. Let's look at some of the issues like farming. Has that gotten better? Has President Trump lived up to all the promises that he made about reviving those economic sectors and saying no. And if you elect Joe Biden, Joe Biden says, he, in fact will make real on those promises -- those failed promises that came from Donald Trump. That's a big difference to offer a positive vision. And I think the slogan they have is build back better. And I think what it is saying, hey, I can really deliver on the economy where the incumbent has not -- doing it. It's a positive agenda. And I think, you know, you think back to the tax cuts, the whole thing that led to buybacks for the big corporations that enrich the very rich in our country, didn't bring back wages or jobs. And I think he is saying that was a failed economic package. And here is an opportunity to actually really bring to life what President Trump had been talking about. So it's not plagiarism. It's saying let's actually do it and get it done. GUTFELD: You know, Dana, who knew that Joe Biden is a jingoistic white nationalist? PERINO: Look, think about where he gave his speech today -- Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania's going to be the main battleground state, I think, coming up in these 3.5 months when -- on Election Day. And so Joe Biden is -- has some work to do, especially in these counties where he was today. I understand that voter registration for Democrats is about down 20 percent. So if he wants to try to find voters who went from Obama to Trump, and he wants to try to get them back to his corner, he has work to do. And so that's one of the reasons that you saw him go out there and do this today. The other thing that happened is that Bernie Sanders invited and have working -- their staffs have been working on these committees to try to figure out where might they be able to agree. And instead of moving to the center, as general election candidates usually do, Joe Biden continues to move more to the left. Maybe not on this economic issue in particular, but I think that Bernie Sanders would be very comfortable with buy American, hire American. Like, that's, like, that's his whole world. The other thing is that Biden -- as soon as he -- as soon as the Trump campaign starts to focus on pushing him to where he is and say he's so far left. And he's going to go even further left, he likes what Bernie likes. He wants to give healthcare to illegal immigrants. He's going to do The Green New Deal all the way. We're going to eliminate all these jobs in Pennsylvania. Just relentlessly focusing on how Biden will actually be beholden to the left seems to me to be where the Trump campaign should try to focus in the next few weeks. GUTFELD: What do you think, Kennedy? MONTGOMERY: I'm not a big fan of populism on either side. But it's especially dangerous when it comes from the left because it breeds this authoritarianism. And then the economy is really going to go down the toilet, because what they are going to do is have these federal mandates on what you can buy and who you can buy it from. It's not just a sense of goodwill that I want to help out American manufacturers and workers and Americans who have great idea and buy their products and services. It is going to be done by force. So when you increase spending, they're also going to increase taxes. There is no greater certain way to tank the economy than to marry those two devils. And that's what Joe Biden is doing with this. And when he's working in concert with Bernie Sanders, who is a devout socialist, it is horrible news for the economy. And I think the more Biden moves up in the polls, the worst it's going to be for the markets. And they're really going to start reacting to that. And also, it's always -- Dana can tell you this. It's always a great idea to steal whatever is working from your opponent. But if the president were to steal something from Joe Biden -- what is it. What is his phrase or his idea? Or the foundation of ideology that is so populist and is working so well that the president would want to borrow from that? I can't think of anything. GUTFELD: Yeah, neither can Joe. Ahead, Beto O'Rourke now blaming Republicans for the surge in violence in liberal cities, that's next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) WILLIAMS: Welcome back. Beto O'Rourke causing controversy for suggesting Republicans are to blame for the recent rise in violence in American cities. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BETO O'ROURKE (D), FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: If you look at the gun laws that are on the books and the gun laws that should be on the books and aren't in this country. In some way, we have tacitly accepted this historic, tragic level of gun violence in America that continues to rise. We saw that just over the weekend in many American cities. It's that same kind of death cult mentality that ask us to accept one quarter, 25 percent of the world's COVID cases, one quarter, 25 percent of the world's COVID deaths, though we represent only four percent of the globe's population. (END VIDEO CLIP) WILLIAMS: And Attorney General Bill Barr, he is saying all black lives should matter after an increase in violence. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BILL BARR, U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL: Obviously, black lives matter. I think all human life is sacred. And also think that it's being used now as sort of distorting the debate to some extent because it's used really to refer exclusively to black lives that are lost to police misconduct, which have been going down statistically. Five years ago, there were 40 such incidents. This last year, it was 10. So at least it's a positive trajectory there. But then you compare to 8,000 homicides in the African American community. Those are black lives that mattered too. (END VIDEO CLIP) WILLIAMS: Greg, can you agree with Beto O'Rourke that even after the big shootings in Newtown, in Vegas and promises from President Trump. Little has been done to deal with gun violence and easy access to guns in America. GUTFELD: You know, this is a really -- this violence explosion is an incredibly serious topic. And Beto is not a serious person. He is the poster child for petulant stupidity. He is the actual opposite of wisdom. So he should not be taken seriously at all. So here is a serious explanation for this problem. We have it all backwards, right? It's not about cops. It's about crime, OK? Crime requires -- crime in inner cities, the black on black crime requires police involvement. Police involvement means more stops, right, more stops. They end up becoming more engaged with young, black men. And more stops create more opportunity for incidents, especially in high crime areas where compliance is a big challenge. So the media pushes this idea that it's police misconduct and police brutality, when the real issue is the crime and the police dealing with the crime and the number the sheer number of police stops, which then makes the incident of the incident percentage drop. It's not as big as the media says it's because it's such a vast number of police stops. So it's about the crime, it's not about the cops. I know you look confused right now Juan, but you can play the show back later and play it really slow, and it'll all make sense to you, and then you'll smile for once when I'm talking. WILLIAMS: OK. Kennedy, you know, the attorney general -- the attorney general was saying in that interview that in Kansas City where they've seen a surge in violence, especially homicides, mostly gun related over the last half a year or so, they're going to work with the mayor and the governor to put in more cops for a 10-day period. Do you think more cops would stop that? MONTGOMERY: Stop a surge of violence that seems to be momentary. It certainly can. But this is what I was talking about. This is what I've been saying for weeks and weeks. When there is a perception that there will be no consequences for your actions, and you have a bunch of people who are out of work, they are frustrated, and they are bored, and now they are angry, and now they're on a mission, and they think the cops aren't going to do anything, yes, they're going to -- they're going to go out and they're going to cause some problems. So there has to be a shift in perception. And that's going to mean more cops, not less. So the whole deform the police movement, it has -- the foundation there is so incredibly shaky that it's going to fall apart and it's going to bring about the exact opposite of what it purports to want. And as far as Beto O'Rourke, he -- all he does is snack on fallacies. He's not a senator, he's not going to be president, he probably won't be anywhere near the Biden ministration if the former vice president wins, but he still can't put two cogent points together to make a logical argument about anything. So he's saying the democratically run cities are somehow subject to a Republican death cult mentality that is then perversely tied to COVID cases. None of that makes sense. He needs to stop talking. WILLIAMS: Dana, in New York City, they say there's a surge in police seeking to retire. Do you think there'd be any trouble replacing them in the current economy? PERINO: Well, sure, because the other thing that I believe that the defund the police movement did was it froze the recruitment for a year. So yes, that's going to be a problem. You need really good cops to be training. The -- what do you call them? They're not freshmen -- rookie cops, rookie cops. Sorry, I'm like, cadets, I don't know. I'm like -- I'm like that other candidate that we've been talking about all day. And now I've got it in my ear as well. All right, the other thing I was going to say is don't forget that Joe Biden has said that he would lean on Beto O'Rourke for his gun policy. Again, another issue that we've been talking about, like showing that the left is going really far to the left. That's what you would end up with. The other thing I wanted to mention about this, is it's been on my mind, is a really distressing editorial in the Wall Street Journal yesterday, about a lot of the business owners, all minorities that are in Minneapolis, whose businesses were ruined and destroyed their merchandise set on fire, things just absolutely destroyed, and they've had zero help. And that fund to that -- all the celebrities poured in millions of dollars, it's like up to $30 million to bail out people that were arrested during the rioting and the looting, there's so $30 million in that account, but nobody's thinking about going to help these business owners. And I think that when -- I think what Attorney General Bill Barr is saying is that, yes, all black lives matter, right? You could say all lives matter, black lives matter, but all black lives matter, and those people deserve our help as well. WILLIAMS: Jesse, I wanted to pick up on Dana's language there because Bill Barr, the Attorney General said, black lives matter but all lives matter. I wonder if he understands how that strikes lots of ears as weakening the focus on racial justice at this moment in terms of trying to repair damage being done to black lives. WATTERS: I don't think he cares about slogans. I just think he cares about human life. And Juan, you really should go back and watch the shows to listen to Greg. I have started doing that myself because half the stuff he says goes over my head, it really sinks in a second time. So, I highly recommend it. But in terms of Beto O'Rourke, I don't think there's no other country in the entire world that puts such a high value on human life as we do in the United States of America. From the pro-life movement to like the fact that we shut down the greatest economy in the world just to save lives, to the to the fact that some guy goes hiking in some canyon and gets lost and we scramble like 13 helicopters to the tune of 350 grand to go rescue the guy. The hostages we bring back all over the world, or like there's one single terror attack, and then we just go ballistic all across the Middle East as a reaction to that. Like, this country loves each and every life and goes to great lengths to protect it. So I think Beto O'Rourke doesn't know what the heck he's talking about there. WILLIAMS: Wow. Well, I think -- I think there could be a long debate about that one because I think lots of people feel like we've had an ongoing problem with so many of that the crime in the inner cities in black on black, you know, homicide. Coming up, college football may be benched this fall. We're going to tell you all about it and about a key warning sign that just happened next on THE FIVE. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) KENNEDY: It's a bad omen for college sports fans desperate to see a little competition this fall. The Ivy League is canceling its athletic calendar. So Greg, you and I both are products of the U.C. system, where you know we are looked down upon academically in terms of, you know, intellectual richness. The Ivy League, yes, that's where the hoity toity kids go. So are they being sensitive in terms of canceling their schedule? GUTFELD: Well, the bad news is the Ivy League canceled all their sports. The good news is no one knew they had sports. I didn't know they had teams. I hope there are people at home very upset that I say that. Why do they switch to playing things that you can play online? Like poker or compete in Grand Theft Auto or Call of Duty? That's what everybody else is doing. KENNEDY: Yes, electronic sports. That's where the shift may be, Dana. And we've also seen there are schools like Stanford and Dartmouth that have cut out entire programs permanently. Stanford just eliminated 11 sports at that school. What does that say about where we are with the economy? PERINO: Yes. I feel bad for all -- I feel bad for the students and also, I'm a little worried about the economy when there's a lot of money that goes into sports. And you know, the Big Ten also is just announced a reduction in their schedule, and I think that's just because they will do anything to get a leg up on the SEC, and the SEC wins all the national titles. The Big ten can't even handle anything. So that's why you're seeing people take advantage of the situation to try to improve their position reputationally. KENNEDY: Yes. And I wouldn't be surprised to see the PAC 12 do the same thing, Juan, because that really is the sleeper league. But this is something in -- there's such purity in college sports, and this is what we've been looking forward to. A lot of programs said they're not going to decide until late July. Should we just call off all of 2020? WILLIAMS: Wow, you know, I'd be disappointed. I'm a big sports fan, Kennedy. But I must say sports is part of life. And so, when you look at people trying to get sports going right now, Major League Soccer is back in gear, but already we've seen the Dallas team, I think it's the Nashville team, and the women's Orlando team have all had to pull back because there was too much of the spread of the virus. And Dr. Fauci says the NFL might not even be able to make it happen this fall. So to me it's kind of disappointing, but you know, sports is life. KENNEDY: Jesse you have no tie, but you do have a crystal ball. What are we going to see between now and the end of the year in terms of sports? WATTERS: I don't know. Dana, I mean, now that the Big Ten has just changed their schedule, so it's just conference games. Who do you think is going to win the Big Ten? PERINO: Is Michigan in the Big Ten? WATTERS: Not bad, not bad. Lucky guess. PERINO: Thank you. WATTERS: Lucky guess. PERINO: Nice try. WATTERS: I had you. I thought I had you. KENNEDY: All right, well, if Jesse seems especially peppy, it's because it's his birthday and we have a very fun surprise ahead to celebrate the man. That's next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) PERINO: All right, it's time now for a very special Jesse Watters' birthday edition of supermarket showdown. All right, we're going to be battling it out over the prices of some of Jesse's favorite items. And whoever guesses the closest without going over wins. First up, you know Jesse is the king of cloth but how does he keep his mane in such pristine condition? We've got some of his hair product. This is hair clay. WATTERS: Yes. PERINO: Hair clay, so write it down, hair clay. WATTERS: I don't even know. PERINO: And let me see if I can see it. We're more socially distanced supermarket showdown. Can you see mine? Right, are you -- nobody cheat. OK, 18. Greg, what does yours say? GUTFELD: $13.50 PERINO: All right, somebody in the control room tell me who wins. GUTFELD: This is working out. PERINO: I won. I won. I swear I didn't Google it. I didn't even know he used hair clay. I didn't even know. It's $26.00. GUTFELD: What was the -- oh, $26.00. PERINO: Wow, Jesse, big spender. I don't even spend that much on my hair. WATTERS: I don't buy it myself. PERINO: All right, the next one is a Jesse statue. Let's see a picture of this, the Jesse statue. WATTERS: Oh, I have -- wait, the life -- the big one or the little one? PERINO: It looks like the little one. WATTERS: I have two statues of myself. PERINO: The big one. The big one. WATTERS: OK, the big one. OK. KENNEDY: Is it functional? GUTFELD: Oh, don't ask, Kennedy. WATTERS: Kennedy. GUTFELD: It's disgusting. PERINO: OK, I put in $125.00 Oh, wow. GUTFELD: I put $14,000. PERINO: $14,000. GUTFELD: $14,000. PERINO: Kennedy wins, $695. Jesse, that is an expensive statue. GUTFELD: I was actually close. PERINO: All right, next we have a Rhoback polo. We know we love this brand. This is a great company the Rhoback Company, a polo. Let's see. What do we think this cost? Let me go with $55.00. I want it in my lighting. GUTFELD: Yes, that's better to do it in single pictures. Now you figured it out. WATTERS: Did I win? PERINO: Jesse wins. WATTERS: What was it? PERINO: Jesse, have you ever paid for one? WATTERS: Yes, Dana. I have. Thanks. PERINO: All right. The other thing we know he loves is a facial. WATTERS: What? PERINO: How much is a facial, a 60-minute facial? WATTERS: How do you know that? Oh yes. PERINO: Don't you remember? WATTERS: I get one BBQ facial in Dallas, one time, years ago. I never lived that day. PERINO: No one will ever forget. WATTERS: All right. PERINO: All right, no one is ever going to forget, Jesse. All right, all right, Jesse wins. WATTERS: Yes. PERINO: $165.00. WATTERS: I definitely paid for that one. PERINO: Jesse, you know yourself so well. WATTERS: I know my facials, Dana. PERINO: All right, there's the next one. I mean, you look -- you look amazing. WATTERS: Thank you. PERINO: I was going to ask you your secret. The last thing is a signed picture of Jesse Watters. What is that -- the cost of that? What is the cost of a signed picture of Jesse Watters? GUTFELD: He pays you. I think he pays you. WATTERS: Priceless. WILLIAMS: Hey, Dana and I had the same price. WATTERS: Very good. PERINO: Jesse and I both put priceless. WATTERS: That's right. WILLIAMS: That's what I put. PERINO: Oh, and Juan too. Great, it's great. And Jesse -- WATTERS: Did I win? PERINO: Jesse won. WATTERS: Yes. PERINO: Of course, it's his birthday. You also win a little something that I think is going to be delivered to you right now as we are on the air. It's a little cupcake. WATTERS: Thank you. Here we go, a chocolate cupcake. No candle. No candle. PERINO: Happy Birthday, Jesse. We love you. WATTERS: Thank you. I'm making a wish. I'm making a wish. PERINO: \"ONE MORE THING\" is up next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) WATTERS: It's time now for \"ONE MORE THING.\" Incredible lifesaving catch at a Phoenix, Arizona. A former wide receiver college football player Philip Banks. Look at these hands. Roll it. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Throw the baby now. (END VIDEO CLIP) WATTERS: That's right. So he sprints to the scene. The baby is thrown off the third-floor balcony, saves the baby's life, brings the baby to safety. Philip Banks, what a hero. Maybe the Eagles could use him. We definitely need someone with hands. All right -- and thank you for my birthday, everybody. Dana, you're next. PERINO: You're welcome. That was a great \"ONE MORE THING,\" Jesse. What an amazing video. You may have heard Charlie Daniels, the just incredible music legend passed away this week. And just about three weeks before he died, our own John Rich had a chance to interview him for his show called \"THE PURSUIT\" with John Rich. Here's a little bit of that interview. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CHARLIE DANIELS, SINGER: My dad didn't play an instrument but he dearly love music. And we were constantly listening to the radio and I used to sing with my dad. He taught me how to sing harmony. We ran along his car and he's singing old songs. (END VIDEO CLIP) PERINO: So you're going to be able to see that on Fox Nation, which is a great place to find all sorts of things. But this in particular is so special, his last interview. And Charlie reflects on a life well-lived and on his journey to pursue the American dream. So check that out. WATTERS: All right, check it out, everybody. Greg Gutfeld. GUTFELD: Let's do this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GUTFELD: Animals are great. Animals are great. Animals are great. (END VIDEO CLIP) GUTFELD: Oh, we got a good one. We got a great one today. I'm so excited. I'm so excited. There's nothing better than tickling a bush baby. Look at that. Look at that bush baby. It loves -- and then you stop, and then it wants to be tickled some more. I don't think there's an animal cuter than a bush baby. And I want to know what the downside is to owning a bush baby. Like, is there something we don't know? Like it's a spit fire or does it poop all over there -- your bed? Like -- but never mind. But anyway, that's a bush baby being tickled and it loves. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GUTFELD: Animals are great. Animals are great. Animals are great. (END VIDEO CLIP) GUTFELD: Look at that. I could watch this for days. Yes, they are. WATTERS: We're actually going to have Johnny getting me a bush baby. Johnny, if you're listening, I want one. Juan, you're up. WILLIAMS: All right, so put me in coach. I want to show off my Gray's t shirt from the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum in Kansas City, Missouri. This year is the 100th anniversary of the Negro Leagues. Major League Baseball planned a big celebration, but the virus obviously abbreviated the season. By the way, that's scheduled to start later this month. So now, former Yankee CC Sabathia, the pitcher, and the Major League Baseball Players Association, have joined with clothing company Roots of Fight to put together a clothing line in honor of iconic black baseball players. The profits will go to the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum and the estate of legendary players like Jackie Robinson, as well as the Black Lives Movement. Sabathia is encouraging people to take a trip out to Kansas City to celebrate the past of baseball and to motivate minority youth today to play the game. WATTERS: It sounds like a great idea. Kennedy, take us home. KENNEDY: I love that shirt. All right, birthday boy. So, one of the things that has gotten many people through the pandemic, through the lockdown has been a little bit of Chardonnay and Pinot Noir. But sometimes if you don't have any wine in your house, what are you to do? Well, look at the wine fairies. They have wings, they have two twos, they sprouted up in Raleigh, North Carolina. There are now 10 states that have wine fairy chapters, and they parade around neighborhoods taking bottles of spirits and good cheer to their friends and they brighten the community with some bubbles, red, white, and all the rosy in between. The wine fairies are really doing a tremendous job. WATTERS: And ironic because that was Gutfeld's nickname in college.

And tonight, we lead with this story. The perfect storm started as the virus broke out in pockets of America this winter. Then we had the unprecedented lockdown that was put in place. There were concerns that the massive resulting unemployment could lead to unrest and instability and uprisings. That was hard to believe or imagine at that point.But now we've seen it as racial tensions poured gasoline on the instability. Now we see what was feared. It is happening in cities across America that are erupting in clashes of all kinds. Big and small, like this one between blue lives matter supporters and Black Lives Matter supporters.(VIDEO PLAYING)MACCALLUM: And then we have seen a huge jump in violent shooting deaths in Milwaukee and Kansas City and Philadelphia, in Chicago, New York, Los Angeles all have numbers that are up surprisingly.Hundreds are dead, including all of these children that you see on your screen in just the past couple of months. But you also remember when shots rang out in the halls of high school in Parkland, Florida, and then in a grammar school before that in Sandy Hook, Connecticut, there was understandable outrage at the deaths of those children rightfully so. And nationwide, calls from Congress to Hollywood to end gun violence.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)ELLEN DEGENERES, HOST, THE ELLEN DEGENERES SHOW: Enough.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Enough.JULIANNE MOORE, ACTOR: Enough.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Demand to plan.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Right now.SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER, D-N.Y.:\u00a0Let us resolve to do something, something about the epidemic of gun violence in this country.REP. NANCY PELOSI, D-CALIF.: The epidemic of gun violence in America. That's a national emergency. Why don't you declare that emergency, Mr. President?(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: So now, with some exceptions, we hear pretty much next to nothing about gun violence from some of these same people. 36 children were killed in primary and secondary school shootings in all of 2018 and 2019. Far too many. We have already covered the shootings and the deaths of dozens of children just since Memorial Day in this country. So, where is the outrage for these kids? Why do they seem to matter less to some people as the country reels in stress and conflict and murder?So, as New York Congressman Peter King watched this scene of Mayor de Blasio painting Black Lives Matter on Fifth Avenue in front of the cameras, he called that a publicity stunt, saying this under de Blasio is leadership, blacks are being murdered at a higher rate than at any time in almost 25 years. And here's President Trump at the White House earlier today.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: 358 percent increase in shootings in New York. Last month, over 300 people were shot. NYPD retirements have quadrupled and they're going up even further and New York City is out of control.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: New York City is out of control, he says. So, in a moment, Congressman King will join us. Also, on THE STORY tonight, John Ayala, the grandfather of this beautiful little boy, Davon McNeal. He was shot over 4th of July weekend in Washington, D.C. So, we're going to get an update on the four suspects there.Also, tonight, Trump Campaign National Press Secretary Hogan Gidley will join me on whether or not the Republican convention is going to happen, whether it will go forward in Florida next month, just few weeks away. And former attorney general now Alabama Senate candidate Jeff Sessions on the state of his primary race, which is tomorrow. And it's a hotly contested one in President Trump plays a big role in that situation. So, we'll talk to Jeff Sessions coming up tonight as well. But we begin, as I mentioned, with Congressman Peter King.Congressman, good to see you. Thank you very much for being here tonight.REP. PETER KING, R-N.Y.: Thank you, Martha.MACCALLUM: You know, I mean, it strikes me when we've covered a lot of these terrible stories of these young people like Davon McNeal, who was shot in D.C. and another young one-year-old who was killed this weekend in New York City. And you don't see the same kind of outrage for these children that we saw for the other children who were also mercilessly killed in those school shootings. Why do you think that is?KING: I think there's so much hypocrisy here, Martha. Whether it's a Black Lives Matter movement, whether it's progressive politicians like Mayor de Blasio and Governor Cuomo and Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez.The fact is that they are more interested I think in pushing a political agenda. I mean listen, everyone agreed, totally agreed that the murder of George Floyd was horrendous. So, since then, we've had riots and demonstrations. We had demonstrations in New York, against the NYPD. We should not have one questionable shooting last year at all, 36,000 cops, 35 shots were fired, the whole year. Only 35 cops even fired the weapons last year. There were five African Americans killed and four of those five had guns or knives. So, far more white shot than blacks in New York.So, all these demonstrations out in the streets denouncing the cops, cursing at the cops, throwing bricks at them, Molotov cocktails. That again was allowed to happen and encouraged. And that encourages the violence. As a result, the cops that's slowly pulling back, there's restrictions put on them as what they can do. They can't even get somebody in a headlock. And as result of that, the thousands of lives that have been saved in the minority communities are now being lost.I mean, I guess maybe 350 shootings since Memorial Day in New York and over 75 murders. 98 percent of the shootings were committed against minorities. And 100 percent of the murder victims are African American. And they would turn their own communities. And that's what the cops have been able to prevent over the last 25 years. But because of these progressive policies and paging Black Lives Matter, which is a radical, as far as I'm concerned, semi-terrorist organization, they're focusing on that and ignoring the fact that innocent black kids - last night, a one-year-old kid was shot down in the streets of Brooklyn at a family outing.MACCALLUM: As you say, there's a very wide spectrum when people say Black Lives Matter. You know, you've got, kids wearing T-shirts that say Black Lives Matter, suburban homes with signs on their front lawn. And then you've got the radical element that is at the heart and the core of it, which is an admittedly Marxist organization. So, it's a very wide spectrum when people use that phrase. I just want to point out.Here's Mayor de Blasio because he did comment on the death of Davell Gardner this morning. And here's how he talked about it. Watch this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BILL DE BLASIO, MAYOR OF NEW YORK: It's heartbreaking for so many reasons. And it begins with the fact that there are just so many guns out there and that is a New York tragedy and a national tragedy.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: Is that the problem?KING: The guns are on the street now because the cops have been pulled back. The cops took more guns off the street over the last several years that can be imagined. But now that unit which was going after guns has been disbanded because it was considered too offensive.So, yes, there are guns on the street, and they're being used by the bad guys. And I wish Mayor de Blasio realize that when he went after the cops, every person in New York should thank the NYPD for the job they've done, especially the African Americans, the minorities living in those communities, which they are the ones whose lives have been saved.We went from 2000 murders a year, the overwhelming majority were black and Hispanic. Now, that was done under 300 last year. Now it's gone back up again. So again, these people who - they have blood on their hands, these politicians, and media people - in New York today and the media stories in the local news, the shooting of that boy, he was like fourth or fifth down. The main story was that somebody threw red paint on the Black Lives Matter side in the middle of the street. That shows how our priorities out of whack. And we got to turn this around or the country is going to be lost.MACCALLUM: Peter King. Congressman, thank you very much. Good to have you here tonight.KING: Thank you, Martha.MACCALLUM: Joining me now, Juan Williams, Fox News Political Analyst, and co-host of The Five. Juan, great to have you with us as well. What's your reaction to that?JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS HOST: Thank you.MACCALLUM: Because we talked so much and we heard so much from, you know, as I said, from members on Capitol Hill to Hollywood folks about these horrific school shootings. And yet we don't hear from them about these children being killed in the middle of this, because the narrative that goes along with it doesn't necessarily fit the things that they seem to be wanting right now.WILLIAMS: I see it a little differently.MACCALLUM: OK.WILLIAMS: I mean, I think obviously, after what we saw in Newtown, after what we saw down in Florida at that high school, and I could go on. Nothing gets done. Even President Trump was saying, you know, we can do something here. He's going to get a deal with the NRA, and nothing gets done.And now you're focusing on, you know, the easy availability of guns in cities that often have strict gun control laws, but they can't control neighboring states and guns flow in the market of illegal, the black market of illegal guns.MACCALLUM: But here's one of the problems with that--WILLIAMS: Aggressive and active.MACCALLUM: That Peter King just mentioned. And, you know, I had a conversation with a former New York City detective who was part of that plainclothes force when he was on the force. And this discussion I had with him was back in, I think it was probably April and when that decision was made that that group was going to be disbanded. He said, you watch what's going to happen this summer in the city. It's going to be horrific because those plainclothes police officers are the ones who get those guns. And in many cases, drugs attached to them off the street.So now, what you've got is basically gang warfare, being able to play out because they know that there's nobody on the street who is a police officer who's not dressed as a police officer. So, they have nothing to fear. These guys in the video that I saw of them coming out and shooting this young boy was so unbelievable.So, they are operating, these gangs are operating in an environment that is much more open and easy for them at this point, Juan.WILLIAMS: Well, I don't know why that unit was disbanded, Martha. But I will say that you have a situation right now in the aftermath of the George Floyd video, where everybody, including Peter King, I will say it was horrific what happened, that you have a police officer kneeling on a man's neck and killing the man like that. So, I think there's more scrutiny and more questions about what we - the authority, the power that we give to police and how they act and behave. So, I don't know that it's necessarily related to the disbanding of this unit that you are talking about that was pulling after guns.MACCALLUM: Well, that was part of the reason that that unit was disbanded because the thinking was that they were walking around--WILLIAMS: They were just disbanded since then?MACCALLUM: Oh, yes. They were disbanded in early May, I believe. And this force of 600 police officers who used to walk around New York City getting guns off the street as undercover police officers, it was determined that they were not fair, that they weren't playing the game fairly and that they needed to be redistributed.WILLIAMS: Well, I don't know.MACCALLUM: Well, that's what happened. Mayor de Blasio wanted that whole group disbanded.WILLIAMS: Well, here's what I think. Well, here's what I think. I think that's a pretty short-term consequence. But my sense is that you have here - my sense of it is, first of all, that this is not as was described by Peter King. First of all, Black Lives Matter. I don't think most Americans would identify them as any terrorist organization. I think that what you have is overwhelming protest against abuse of power by police and bad apples in the police department that need to be reined in that the police--MACCALLUM: But the result, Juan.WILLIAMS: People who protect bad cops.MACCALLUM: But the result is that you are seeing these children get killed and people get murdered in our cities in America because the police have been told to pull back.WILLIAMS: That's not what I think. I think you have, first of all, in black and brown neighborhoods, low income black and brown neighborhoods with the summer, with the fact that people were pent up with the Coronavirus. Now that you have this explosion and it is horrific. And guess what? There are lots of people who are not involved, like these children who get killed, Martha. And it's just tragic and it's wrong.And I hope Black Lives Matter would stand up and say that's wrong and that this kind of murder, as you see it, mostly black on black is not good. It's terrible. And the people inside the black community, my community should be outraged about it, just as we're outraged over abuse of police power.But to somehow tie it and say, oh, police aren't doing their job. First of all, I think police take an oath and I respect the police and I think they do their job. So, it's not their responsibility. You had some thug or gangster or a drug dealer pulling a trigger.MACCALLUM: There's clearly less interaction because police officers hesitate. And that I mean - I think that's pretty well known in many of these departments. They'll tell you that they think twice about entering certain situations because they don't want to end up being that guy. And, you know, everybody understands that what we saw with George Floyd was horrific. I think there's universal opinion on that and on any similar situation.But what's happening is that people are dying as a result of the policies that we're seeing play out here. And I think that, you know, this this is a situation where all these little children's lives matter immensely and we need to think twice about it. So, I thank you very much for being here tonight, talking to me. Thanks, Juan.WILLIAMS: You're welcome. That's a good conversation.MACCALLUM: Good to see you, Juan. So, coming up, President Trump today insisting that his nominating convention will happen, but there are reports that some in the campaign are wondering, is it really worth it? Do people decide who to vote for based on these big conventions? 2020 Press Secretary Hogan Gidley here on that and more. And then Karl Rove and Chris Hahn will weigh in on these polls that we're seeing in Texas and in Florida where COVID-19 has dug in. Coming up next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Are you going to be able to hold the convention in Jacksonville with all this virus spreading?TRUMP: Well, we're going to see it built up a little bit, but we're going to do something that will be great.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: President Trump pressing ahead with plans for the Republican convention in Jacksonville, Florida, as his state deals with a surge in COVID-19 cases. There are some growing questions about what this convention may actually look like in the end. Here now, Hogan Gidley, Trump's 2020 National Press Secretary with a new title at the campaign. Hogan, good to see you tonight. Thank you very much for being here. So, 100 percent definite convention in Florida?HOGAN GIDLEY, TRUMP 2020 NATIONAL PRESS SECRETARY: We're looking to move forward with it in Jacksonville. The President's very excited about it. But, of course, he wants the American people to be safe. He cares about the health and safety and security of the people that would come to that convention. And there'll be a lot of them, I can promise you that. But we're working with people on the ground, too, with Governor DeSantis in his office, the mayor as well, the RNC, all the local officials. And quite frankly, the health experts, because we want to make sure if we proceed forward, how it looks and the measures that need to be in place to make sure that when this thing goes off, it goes off safe.MACCALLUM: So, if we proceed, I heard in there, so it sounds like there is an opening that this might not happen. Are there people within the campaign who are arguing for? Look, it doesn't matter. We can do this a different way this time around.GIDLEY: No, people are excited because they want to see this this convention happen. It's been you know; this country has seen an unprecedented, unforeseen crisis in the pandemic coming from China. And as we work our way through this and we put the health measures in place to make sure the American people are safe, it's time to get back out and enjoy life. And one of the ways we can do that is with this convention.But at the same time, as I said, the president cares about the health and safety of the American people. So, we're going to proceed in the best way possible.MACCALLUM: All right. So, what's the likelihood that you're going to do something outside and that there will be social distancing at this event? I know there were a couple of places that have been looked at outside. It was something that a lot of people thought maybe should have been considered right up - out of the gate. And why wasn't it?GIDLEY: Sure. Well, look, we're looking at all the options out there. The President wants to go into the great state of Florida. One of the states, a pundit said he could never win. That helped catapult him into the White House and thank them for all of their hard work. They want to hear the man speak, you know as well as I do, whether it's a rally or a convention speech. People will do anything and everything to get in and hear this man and cheer him on and thank him for improving their lives.And when you look at the vision the President is putting forward of a great America, making this country get through this pandemic and better on the backside of it, the uplifting, patriotic message he has. And compare and contrast that with Joe Biden, who wants to defund the police and thinks America is now in the cause of all the problems--MACCALLUM: You say a lot of people want to turn out and they always historically have. You know, obviously the crowds at these rallies have historically been enormous. But Tulsa wasn't a great experience, then New Hampshire got canceled. So that has to be forcing a little bit of a different conversation at the campaign right now.GIDLEY: Look, again, I would argue Tulsa was successful. 11 million people saw that thing. That's incredible. Broke all kinds of record.MACCALLUM: On TV.GIDLEY: I think New Hampshire just because of the weather. Listen, we want to proceed, but we want to do it in a proper way. The President cares about the safety and security of the American people, as I said. And so, we'll look at all options. But the fact is, we're moving forward with this convention in Jacksonville. We want people to be safe. And we're looking forward to getting the President's message out there.MACCALLUM: So, one of the other messages that has been out there is, you know, sort of where to place the blame for some of the numbers that are a little soft right now and we're early out. I think a lot of people don't make up their mind about these things till well after Labor Day and certainly after these conventions, if they happen and the debates are going to be a huge data point here as well.But the things that have floated out from even members of the task force is and from the President as well, a little bit of finger pointing at Dr. Fauci, like, well, you know, maybe he should have told us earlier to wear masks. Then also finger pointing at the head of the campaign, Brad Parscale. There was a piece in The Washington Post today sort of suggesting that there's some blame going in that direction. Is that fair?GIDLEY: No, it's not. I'm going to break some news on your program tonight. I'll give you some numbers that no one knows. And that's this, to all of our media platforms right now, we just eclipse a milestone. No one knows about this. So, again, just for you, Martha, 1.1 billion views of our show we put forth on the Trump networks. 107 shows, the President has only participated in a few of them. The excitement is out there. People are engaged. They want to get out and vote for this President.And when you see the numbers of registered Republicans outpacing that of Democrats in key swing states, we're doing something right. Money raised at a pace no one thought possible. And it's because we have a great candidate. Make no mistake, when you're talking about Joe Biden, you don't have to guess what his economy would look like.You saw it for eight years, depressed wages, jobs leaving shores, 3 million of them go into China alone. You don't have to guess what the culture would look like. He pops out of his basement every once in a while, to say defund the police. The fact is, our jobs aren't safe, our families aren't safe, and our American way of life is not safe with Joe Biden, because he is waging war on all three policies.MACCALLUM: A very different reality right now. And everybody's forced to kind of think creatively and do their business in a creative way. And I think that works in the campaign environment as well. And we'll see how it all plays out. Hogan, thank you very much. Good to have you here tonight.GIDLEY: It does. Thank you.MACCALLUM: Next up, Karl Rove, former Deputy Chief of Staff to President George W. Bush and a Fox News Contributor. Chris Hahn is a former aide to Senator Chuck Schumer and a syndicated radio host. Good to have both of you with us tonight.CHRIS HAHN, FORMER AIDE TO CHUCK SCHUMER: Great to be here.MACCALLUM: Karl, what do you think? Does the convention have to happen, and does it have to happen in Jacksonville? Does it have to happen the way it usually does? What do you think?KARL ROVE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, it won't happen the way it usually does, because typically these are gigantic festivals for the Democrats and Republicans. Lots of donors, lots of activists, lots of interest groups. They swarmed the convention site. They go on for a week or two before the convention begins. There are enormous crowds during the convention. Many of them never get into the hall, but they go to the parties. They go to events. They go to the satellite. You've seen them. You've been at a couple of these.MACCALLUM: Yes, I've been at a lot of them.ROVE: That's not going to happen.MACCALLUM: Yes.ROVE: And it's going to be a slimmed down version. The key is going to be, can the Democrats and the Republicans both figure out how to showcase their candidate's acceptance speech, because typically, historically, going back to the beginning of the TV age, the moment of the acceptance speech is the most watched point of the campaign, except the presidential debates. And so, as they're going to be looking for ways to do that, it's going to be interesting to see how they deal with it in a time play.MACCALLUM: It's going to be fascinating. I mean, they've only got a few weeks to hammer this out. And I think, you know, everybody's got to put it their creative hats on and come up with something that is going to, you know, really wow people, and get them to tune in.Let's take a look at some of these polls and get Chris's reaction. And then Karl's reaction. So, the first poll that we have is - what do we have there? Texas. Arizona. There is Arizona, Arizona is flat. 46-46. Florida has Biden up by 6 points right now. And Texas has Trump up by only 1 point. Chris, have at it? What you see there?HAHN: Well, you know, I told Karl on this program a few weeks ago that Texas is going to be in play. Texas is going to be in play. The average of polls in Texas right now is 0.1 percent for Trump on the average of polls. I think Biden is going to win Texas especially, hopefully somebody senior in the Bush family will come out and endorse Biden in Texas. That will put him over the top. I don't know if George itself, but it's going to happen.MACCALLUM: So, Karl is that going to happen? Is George Bush going to come out and endorse Joe Biden.ROVE: You know, it's an unusual for a major media figure like Chris Hahn to visibly demonstrate that he's smoking dope on television. It's amazing. I mean, it's really--HAHN: Hey now.MACCALLUM: Chris, you're not smoking dope, are you?ROVE: The American people can believe that Texas is in play. The American - no, obviously, I'm kidding. But he is, like, weird. So, we can believe that Texas is absolutely in play when Joe Biden comes down here and buys a lot of TV and appoints even a state chairman.HAHN: He's going to.ROVE: Let me finish, Chris, please, for once, for God's sake, please.MACCALLUM: Go ahead.ROVE: So, but until that happens, we can - look, the state's going to be close. No ifs, ands or buts about it. But the idea that this is a state that is in play and is a top target of the Democrats, I have yet to see, you know, they're not even a Biden state chairman. There's no staff on the ground. There's no TV buys. There's no--HAHN: Here's why?ROVE: It's not there.MACCALLUM: Final thought, Chris.HAHN: Here's why it's in play. Abbott and Warso (ph) Dan Patrick, two Trump clones have ruined the recovery to COVID-19, in Texas. It has made more people's lives in danger and it has endangered the economy of Texas and the nation as a whole. So that just--ROVE: I just saw a poll looking at that and Governor Abbott's approval rating at 66 percent approval rating. He didn't like your Governor Cuomo. He did not send people with COVID to nursing homes--(CROSSTALK)MACCALLUM: You go ahead.HAHN: Please, please Karl. Karl, you're going to need multiple whiteboards to figure out a map for Donald Trump to win this presidency. He's such a failure. He's failed on so many levels in so many states. I am so dizzy--(CROSSTALK)ROVE: You've got to get a new rap. We keep hearing this every time we're together.MACCALLUM: We're going to keep this--(CROSSTALK)ROVE: Say something substantive--MACCALLUM: I think it's similar conversation. I'm not exactly sure if it was with you, Chris Hahn. But I know Karl Rove said that Beto O'Rourke would never win Texas and that he could see that that was never going to happen. And, you know, so here we are or--ROVE: Martha, one thing here.HAHN: As bad a candidate--ROVE: One thing before we go. Chris said that Biden is going to win Texas. I want to bet a $1000 Chris's favorite charity, not a political group, but a charity. If he'll bet a $1000 to my favorite charity, that I say Biden doesn't win Texas. He says Biden does. Let's see if he's going to man up right now.HAHN: I need odds, Karl. I need odds.(CROSSTALK)MACCALLUM: All right, bye guys. Talk to you next time. All right. Coming up, Dr. Scott Atlas says that science proves he's very emphatic about this. He says schools absolutely must reopen and he says the science demands that they do. He's back with his argument right after this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: Schools should be opened. Schools should be opened. Kids want to go to school.(END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)MACCALLUM: The latest political divide appears to be going back to school with Democrats mostly urging caution and Republicans mostly, starting with the president, saying that kids need to get back into the classroom or risk a learning loss that maybe irreparable.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. NANCY PELOSI, D-CALIF.,\u00a0SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE: Going back to school presents the biggest risk for the spread of the coronavirus. They ignore science and they ignore governance in order to make this happen. If there are CDC guidelines, they should be requirements.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: Dr. Scott Atlas, senior fellow at Stanford University Hoover Institution and former chief of neuroradiology at Stanford University Medical Center. Doctor, welcome back to the program. Good to have you.SCOTT ATLAS, PROFESSOR AND CHIEF OF NEURORADIOLOGY, STANFORD UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER: Thanks, Martha.MACCALLUM: She says, Nancy Pelosi says that this is the biggest risk to the spread of the virus if the kids go back in September.ATLAS: I think we have a different scale because that's just completely wrong and contrary to all the science. And when I say, when I say all the science, I'm talking about signs all over the world not just in the United States but Switzerland, Sweden, Canada, France, the Netherlands, Australia, Asia.I mean, it's totally contrary to the science and here's the science, I'm not sure how many times it has to be said but the risk to children from this disease for fatality is nearly zero. The risk to children for a significant illness is, quote, \"far less from seasonal flu\" according to JAMA Pediatrics.I mean, this is totally antithetical to the data. And the other thing that we have to, obviously we know this by now it's been confirmed all over the world. Children rarely transmit the disease to adults. This is --(CROSSTALK)MACCALLUM: Well that's the biggest concern, if -- pardon me for hopping in, but that's the quickest rebuttal to that. That, you know, yes, but these kids aren't going to realize their carriers, they're going to go home and infect their parents or their grandparents.ATLAS: Well, but those are people that obviously either don't know the data or are refractory to learning themselves because the facts say otherwise. And this has been proven by contract tracing all over the world by studies on these kids. This is like really ludicrous.But I think the most important thing of all, well, the other -- there's two points that I want to make. One is that teaching is a young profession. In the United States half the teachers are 40 or less and a quarter of them are under 30. Ninety percent are under 60 in public schools.They have almost zero risk from this and for those high risk teachers, which there are some, if they believe in masks and social distancing, don't think they know how to do that by now, and if they're still afraid to do their job, why can't they teach from a distance? If they think social distancing works, teach in a class, if they think a distance learning works, teach from home.But the problem here and this the biggest point of all, I never hear anyone talk about the harms of closing schools. The harms are against the children. Anyone who prioritizes children would open the schools. That's just counterfactual to say that, you know, the children are not the risk or, you know, were at risk here.When we see the harms to children, most children learn most of what's in schools from social engagement, from learning how to resolve conflicts from dealing with others.MACCALLUM: Yes. So true.ATLAS: This is obvious. When children learned that they need a hearing aid or glasses, that's done in school. There are over almost a quarter of a million apparently reported child abuse cases --MACCALLUM: Yes.ATLAS: -- missed because children's child abuse is most noticed in the schools. And so, I mean, I'm not sure. We are the only country in the world, this is a level of hysteria like this is something I feel like I'm living in a Kafka novel here. I mean, I get thousands of e-mails a week from all over the world, from professors, teachers, mothers in the United States and elsewhere, they are stunned that we are willing to just simply destroy our children out of some bizarre notion that is completely contrary to the science.MACCALLUM: Yes. I mean, we watched some countries in Scandinavia that went right back. The kids all went right back and they did very well. So, this is really important, you know, that the kids they -- the learning deficit is so dramatic and we're going to talk to Betsy DeVos about this later in the week.But Dr. Atlas, I got to go but thank you so much. Always good to have you with us.ATLAS: All right.MACCALLUM: Coming up, former Attorney General Jeff Sessions served in the United States Senate for than 20 years and now he faces the fight of his life to get back there after an ugly divorce from his time in the Trump administration. Remember this?(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP:\u00a0They put this country through, Jeff Sessions was a disaster. He was a total disaster because he basically let it happen, unknowingly, because he is not very smart.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: Well, he see that criticism quite a bit from the president. He is here tonight to talk about that and about his Senate race hours ahead of a crucial run-off in Alabama, coming up next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)MACCALLUM: Ever since Jeff Sessions left his attorney general post President Trump has been trashing his earliest Capitol Hill supporter. Now the president is backing Sessions' opposition Republican Tommy Tuberville in tomorrow's primary runoff tweeting this. Big Senate race in Alabama on Tuesday, but T. Tuberville he is a winner who will never let you down. Jeff Sessions is a disaster who let us all down. We don't want him back in Washington.To which Jeff Sessions clap back, I've taken the road less traveled, not sought fame or fortune, my honor and integrity are far more important than these juvenile insults. Your scandal ridden candidate is too cowardly to debate, as you know Alabama does not take orders from Washington.Joining me now, less than five more hours until runoff date, Jeff Sessions, former attorney general and 2020 Alabama Senate candidate. Good to see you, sir. Thank you very much for being here tonight.JEFF SESSIONS, FORMER U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL: Thank you, Martha.MACCALLUM: We have a poll from May, I want to point out that this is a very old poll but there are several polls that show you double digits behind Mr. Tuberville. How are you feeling as you head into tomorrow given that?SESSIONS: Thanks. I'm moving our way there's no doubt about it, our campaign is catching fire people are finally beginning to ask who is our opponent? Where did he come from? He just passed through Alabama 18 months ago. He claimed for tax purposes his home in Florida. He is wrong on trade, wrong on immigration, wrong on China.He's not been advocating for the Trump agenda that I have been advocating for. His name is going to be on the ballot tomorrow, not President Trump's.MACCALLUM: OK.SESSIONS: We'll be voting for him in November but the choice is clear. My opponent is hiding out, he rejected coming on your program. He rejected Bret Baier's program, he's gone radio silence in the state --MACCALLUM: All right.SESSIONS: -- since the scandals have broken there.MACCALLUM: Let me ask you this. You know, it's interesting that you say that you -- one of the things that you would do if you get to go to the Senate would be to defend President Trump's policies. Even though every chance that he gets he tries to undermine you in this campaign. How do you do that?SESSIONS: The president has strong feelings about this and he gets to express those opinions, but let me tell you. I was for those policies before he announced. I was the number one voice in the Senate for them. I believe in them. Not because of any personal gain but because I think they're right for America and Alabama.He needs stronger voices in the Senate. The Senate is not speaking out sufficiently on trade, on immigration, on China. Those are particularly difficult issues. Judges. Religious freedom. Those things, I know about, I fought for, I understand them. I'll help him, I want him to succeed.MACCALLUM: OK.SESSIONS: That's the fundamental thing because it's good for America.MACCALLUM: So, interestingly, I want to ask you a question about what happened with Roger Stone and the commutation which is obviously been a controversial decision. And it's interesting that last week the person who came out after you, Attorney General Bill Barr said that he -- he was asked about the Stone sentence and he said that he thought the sentence for him was fair given the crime. And he also said that he thought that it was a righteous prosecution. Do you agree?SESSIONS: Well, I don't know the details of that case. I would just say the president clearly has the power to pardon. President Obama did 200. One of them was a terrorist who was teaching people how to make bombs to blow up the United States.So, the president has this power. I respect Attorney General Barr. I like the fact that he's digging into all these matters, these allegations of unfairness and federal abuses in FBI and prosecutors. I think this matter, this Russia matter, can never be completed until the American people have a belief that the investigators themselves have been evaluated properly and wrongdoing punished wherever it occurring.MACCALLUM: All right. Former Attorney General and Senate candidate in Alabama, once again, Jeff Sessions. Thank you very much. Good to see you, sir.SESSIONS: Thank you.MACCALLUM: So, this little boy is 11-year-old Davon McNeal. He was shot and killed by a stray bullet during a Fourth of July peace cookout that was organized by his family to bring people together in his community. He's quite the young athlete, had a bright future ahead of him.One of the suspects connected to his murder was recently released from prison because of COVID-19 and they wanted to let people out. Davon's grandfather, John Ayala who you met here last week wants to update us on what's going on in this case. He says that a violent offender never should have been let out of prison. He is here next. Don't miss it when we come back.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: He shot my baby in his head. He got shot in his head. It looks so bad.(END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOHN AYALA, DAVON MCNEAL'S GRANDFATHER: He gets out of the car, shots ring. He hits the ground, Crystal looks and saying get up. You don't get up, so she goes to see what's going on and realize that he was hit with one of the bullets that was being shot.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: That's the grandfather of a 11-year-old Davon McNeal describing the senseless shooting that took the life of his grandson over the Fourth of July weekend. When asked about Davon's football coach said, quote, \"we just had a real genuine kid who wanted to get out of the neighborhood. That's all he said, is I'm going to make it.\"There are four suspects at least connected to Davon's killing, two have been arrested including 22-year-old Christian Wingfield who was in custody for possession of a firearm but released because of the COVID-19 outbreak when they left numbers of people out of prisons to control the outbreak.So, two of the other suspects are still out there, still on the run. And police are working on a warrant for a fifth alleged shooter we have learned in this case.Davon McNeal's grandfather, John Ayala is here once again on THE STORY with me tonight. He is the founder of the D.C. chapter of the Guardian Angels, an organization that works with police to prevent a crime.Mr. Ayala, thank you so much for joining me tonight. And again, I just -- my heart breaks for you and your family and your grandson was a beautiful kid. I'm sorry for your loss. What do you think about this news that one of these men was released from prison because of COVID-19?AYALA: I am absolutely outraged. Just about a month ago, I was watching the news up in New York City. About the same thing happening and someone was released during the COVID-19 within 24 hours committed a murder. Then here in D.C. we had a young man that was 16 years old also released from COVID. Sixteen. And within 30 days after that being released, he shot nine people. And of those nine, four are deceased.This is a young man at 16 years old running around with the guns. Now in his home, you know, another young man that was brought up on gun charges released because of COVID.MACCALLUM: Yes.AYALA: And him and his friends decided to tote their weapons and get involved in the turf war. He shot my grandson. I don't know -- I mean, I don't even know they were out there, they shot my grandson and this probably could have been avoided if he was still locked out. We don't know who was the leader, was he the leader of this?MACCALLUM: Yes.AYALA: Were the other guys? We don't know. But what I do know is that he should have been in prison not on the streets.MACCALLUM: What is your message to the other individuals that were involved in the shooting which is being a premeditated first-degree murder?AYALA: I definitely -- I definitely see that because these gentlemen knew what they were doing. The sad thing is, two of these guys actually attended Crystal stop the violence cookout. Actually, he was over there. They posted pictures on their Instagram page. And then they go out right after and they kill her son. You know, you guys, the guy would be watching, you got to turn yourself in.(CROSSTALK)MACCALLUM: Why? I mean, what do you say to the people -- they have to turn themselves in if they're watching. I want to make sure that message gets out there. So, give everybody, why --(CROSSTALK)AYALA: Yes, definitely.MACCALLUM: -- what happened? What was that turf war about, why are they out there, you know, ending these young lives?AYALA: You know, I don't know what the turf war is about but these young guys in the community, what happens if there some kind of beef among them, usually it's one person that gets deceased in another community because of a shooting.They don't believe in telling the police. It's revenge. So, they come back and forth they shoot up each other's community and when they do that, they don't care who's around. They don't care if it's children, grandmothers, parents. They just want somebody from that community to lose their life.MACCALLUM: To pay the price.AYALA: So that community can be in mourning and that is the worst attitude that anybody can have.MACCALLUM: John, thank you so much, John Ayala. We'll keep on THE STORY. We'll be right back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)MACCALLUM: That's the story of Monday, July 13, 2020. But as always, the story continues so we'll see you back here tomorrow night. Tucker Carlson, coming up next. Good night, everybody.", "comment": "", "topic": "Transcript", "date": " July 13"}]
