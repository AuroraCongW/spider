China will make legitimate and necessary reactions,\u201d the statement said.\nChina maintains consulates in San Francisco, Los Angeles, Chicago and New York in addition to its embassy in Washington.\nThe U.S. has four other consulates in China and an embassy in Beijing, keeping the sides in parity in terms of diplomatic missions.\nThe Chengdu consulate briefly came to prominence when the police chief of the nearby city of Chongqing fled there in 2012, precipitating the downfall of Chongqing\u2019s politically ambitious leader Bo Xilai in China\u2019s biggest political scandal in decades. It also played host to former Vice President Joe Biden during a visit when the current prospective Democratic Party presidential candidate was accompanied by China\u2019s now-leader Xi Jinping.\nPolice closed off a two- to three-block area around the consulate, cutting off virtually any view of the property including the flag. A few vehicles were allowed through after police checks, and others could be seen moving in the distance.\nMoving trucks arrived at the U.S. consulate the previous day and left a few hours later. Late Sunday night, flatbed trailers entered the complex. One later emerged carrying a large shipping container and a crane.\nBefore the area was closed, the impending closure of the consulate drew a steady stream of onlookers over the weekend as Chengdu, like Houston, found itself in the limelight of international politics.\nPeople stopped to take selfies and photos, jamming a sidewalk busy with shoppers and families with strollers on a sunny day in the city of Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan province. A little boy posed with a small Chinese flag before plainclothes police shooed him away as foreign media cameras zoomed in.\nPolice had shut the street and sidewalk in front of the consulate and set up metal barriers along the sidewalk on the other side of the tree-lined road.\nUniformed and plainclothes officers kept watch on both sides of the barriers after scattered incidents following the Chengdu announcement on Friday, including a man who set off firecrackers and hecklers who cursed at foreign media shooting video and photos of the scene.\nA man who tried to unfurl a large placard late Sunday that he called an open letter to the Chinese government was quickly taken away.\nEarlier, a bus left the consulate grounds and what appeared to be embassy staff spoke with plainclothes police before retreating back behind the property\u2019s solid black gates. It wasn\u2019t clear who or what was on the bus.\nThree medium-size trucks arrived and left a few hours later, and cars with diplomatic plates departed in between.\nThe U.S. alleged that the Houston consulate was a nest of Chinese spies who tried to steal data from facilities in Texas, including the Texas A&M medical system and the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston. China said the allegations were \u201cmalicious slander.\u201d\n\n\u00a0"}, {"cover": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/8nEqxHBgFigVYsKzhQaA5g--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5f1b6f63220000e00d387904.jpg", "topic": "POLITICS", "title": "As A Candidate, Trump Asked FBI In Intelligence Briefing: 'Are  Russians Bad?'", "author": "By Mary Papenfuss", "date": "July 25, 2020", "url": "https://search.huffpost.com/click/_ylt=Awr4xJR0AS1f41MAoA9sBmVH;_ylu=X3oDMTByNWU4cGh1BGNvbG8DZ3ExBHBvcwMxBHZ0aWQDBHNlYwNzYw--/RV=2/RE=1596813812/RO=10/RU=https%3a%2f%2fwww.huffpost.com%2fentry%2ftrump-fbi-russian-interference-transcript_n_5f1b5514c5b6128e6825d9f0/RK=2/RS=Nxd.9I3GU3sloudS32mFMJTZSRk-", "keyword": "China and the world order", "website": "Huffpost", "subtitle": "GOP senators pushed to have this once-classified document released, but maybe they shouldn\u2019t have.", "content": "When the FBI gave candidate Donald Trump\u00a0his first intelligence briefing in 2016 and warned that foreign agents might try to infiltrate his campaign, Trump asked, \u201cAre the Russians bad?\u201d according to an official\u00a0summary of the meeting\u00a0obtained by Politico.The summary was filed as part of Operation Hurricane, the code name for the FBI investigation launched in August 2016 into suspected Kremlin interference in that year\u2019s election and possible ties to the Trump campaign.\u00a0Trump-appointed Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe declassified and released the summary of the briefing this week at the behest of Senate Republicans looking to present the FBI as targeting Trump even before his election.But Trump\u2019s own comments about Russia, related in the FBI summary, place him in a less-than-favorable light \u2014 revealing him to be either incredibly gullible and unsophisticated in his understanding, or deliberately disingenuous about Russia.Michael Flynn, who would later go on to be Trump\u2019s national security adviser, and former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, Trump\u2019s transition team leader, were also at the 13-minute briefing, in which FBI agent Joe Pientka\u00a0presented them with the basics of the threat to U.S. security.\u00a0According to Pientka\u2019s summary, Trump asked him if the Russians were more dangerous than the Chinese because they have more operatives in the U.S.The agent said both countries are bad and told the men that the number of operatives was \u201cnot an indicator of the severity of the threat,\u201d according to the document.The FBI agent then shared that when he told Trump and his team that the U.S. is a \u201cworld leader in counterintelligence,\u201d Trump asked: \u201cRussia, too?\u201dAccording to the summary, Trump also asked which country, Russia or China, was worse when it came to violations of nuclear testing bans and was told: \u201cThey are both bad, but Russia is worse.\u201d\u201cTrump and Christie turned toward each other, and Christie commented, \u2018I\u2019m shocked,\u2019\u201d Pientka wrote of their reactions to that information.Pientka also said he warned the men that foreign agents might try to approach their relatives, friends and campaign staff in the U.S. to obtain \u201cinformation pertaining to political,\u00a0economic, energy, technology and military policy/plans of the U.S.\u201d in order to \u201ccollect inside information to give their country a competitive advantage over the U.S.\u201dTrump was also advised to take special care with phone and electronic communications that could be hacked, according to the summary. Trump has repeatedly used his personal cell phone for official conversations, despite warnings from aides not to do so.Pientka, who would continue to be part of the Russia investigation, noted in his summary of the meeting that he was on the alert for any comments on Russia from the Trump team. \u201cDuring the [intelligence] briefs, writer actively listened for topics or questions regarding the Russian Federation,\u201d he wrote.Former White House Secretary Sarah Sanders told Fox News Friday that the transcript is proof the FBI was out to \u201ctake down\u201d Trump. But the transcript clearly shows Pientka offering advice to Trump and his team on how to deal with possible overtures by foreign agents. He was not questioning them.At the time of the briefing, the FBI had disturbing indications of Russian interference in the 2016 election, including a Kremlin-orchestrated hack of emails from the Democratic National Committee, which were published by\u00a0WikiLeaks\u00a0and benefited the Trump campaign.Trump later called on Russia to get his Democratic opponent\u00a0Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails, and those were hacked and leaked\u00a0as well.Despite his repeated insistence that the probe into Russian election interference was a \u201cwitch hunt,\u201d Trump has also attacked his predecessor\u00a0Barack Obama for not being aggressive enough in investigating Russia\u2019s actions.Robert Mueller\u2019s special counsel report last year concluded that the \u201cRussian government interfered in the 2016 presidential election in sweeping and systematic fashion\u201d in a way that \u201cfavored\u201d Trump. The report also noted numerous contacts between members of the Trump campaign and Kremlin representatives.By 2016, Trump had a long business history with Russia, and was even working to get a Trump tower built in Moscow. Eric Trump, one of the president\u2019s sons, told a golf journalist in 2014 that the Trump Organization had \u201call the funding we need out of Russia\u201d\u00a0\u2014 which he later denied saying."}, {"cover": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/83FVmnzRembDUt4gpDMfbg--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5f1599d0270000e50de67143.jpg", "topic": "-NEWS", "title": "Coronavirus Live Updates: Read  Latest About  COVID-19 Outbreak", "author": "By Paige Lavender", "date": "July 20, 2020", "url": "https://search.huffpost.com/click/_ylt=Awr4xJR0AS1f41MAog9sBmVH;_ylu=X3oDMTByNWU4cGh1BGNvbG8DZ3ExBHBvcwMxBHZ0aWQDBHNlYwNzYw--/RV=2/RE=1596813812/RO=10/RU=https%3a%2f%2fwww.huffpost.com%2fentry%2fcovid-19-latest-news-worldwide-updates_n_5f159982c5b6d14c336a1a6b/RK=2/RS=0Si.hCAIu7g.XCugwbH0jrt9EiU-", "keyword": "China and the world order", "website": "Huffpost", "subtitle": "Stay up to date as we cover the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and its effects across the world.", "content": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince Chinese officials locked down the city of Wuhan in January, there have been more than 16.2 million cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, across the planet.\nMore than 648,000 people have died from the disease,\u00a0according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEfforts to curb the outbreak have led to the global disruption of daily life and the economy, as schools and workplaces shuttered in hopes of slowing transmission.

He is reportedly quarantining at home and continuing to work remotely.\nO\u2019Brien\u2019s diagnosis makes him the highest profile Trump administration official known to have tested positive for the virus. Vice President Mike Pence\u2019s press secretary\u00a0tested positive\u00a0in May, as did one of Trump\u2019s personal valets. Several Trump campaign staffers, including top fundraising official Kimberly Guilfoyle, have also tested positive in recent weeks.\n\u2014 Hayley Miller\nBirx Urges Several States To Close Bars, Limit Social Gatherings\u00a0\u2014 7/27/20, 9 a.m. ET\nDr. Deborah Birx, the coronavirus response coordinator for the Trump administration, urged states with rising infections to impose new restrictions that include closing bars, reducing indoor restaurant capacity and limiting social gatherings to 10 people.\n\u201cWe can see what is happening in the South is moving north,\u201d Birx\u00a0told reporters\u00a0in Kentucky on Sunday, suggesting that new hot spots outside of Florida, Texas and other Southern states are beginning to emerge.\nBirx said she is specifically focused on controlling the pandemic \u201cbefore it gets worse\u201d in Kentucky, Tennessee, Ohio, Indiana and Virginia, and she recommended that \u201c100%\u201d of individuals in these states wear masks when they\u2019re in public or around others.\nKentucky allowed bars to reopen on June 29, but Gov. Andy Beshear (D) said Sunday that he planned to announce new restrictions early this week amid a surge in new cases. As of Monday, the state has\u00a0recorded more than 27,000 cases\u00a0and at least 718 deaths.

Researchers will inject volunteers with either the experimental vaccine or a placebo and track which people contract the virus as they go about their lives.

That figure exceeds New York\u2019s 416,000, which has seen just under 5,000 cases in the last week.\nCalifornia currently has the most cases of any state in the country.\nDespite the official figures, it\u2019s hard to know just how many people have been infected in epicenters of the pandemic as both New York and California had surges earlier this year when testing was limited, The New York Times reported.

North Korea has previously denied having any cases of the virus, though outside experts have questioned that claim,\u00a0according to The Associated Press.\nNorth Korea\u2019s official Korean Central News Agency said the suspected virus patient had illegally entered the country last week after fleeing to South Korea three years ago. The patient, anyone who had contact with them, and those who were in Kaesong recently have been placed under quarantine, according to KCNA.\nDuring an emergency meeting of top North Korean officials, Kim was quoted as saying there was a \u201ccritical situation in which the vicious virus could be said to have entered the country.\u201d\nRead more from the AP\u00a0here.\n\u2014 Hayley Miller\nMore Than A Third Of Coronavirus Patients Feel Symptoms For Weeks \u2015 7/25/20, 11:35 a.m. ET\nMore than a third of coronavirus patients experience symptoms for weeks, even if they don\u2019t have a severe case of COVID-19, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Saturday.\nOf 293 people who had the virus surveyed by the CDC, 35% said they still felt negative symptoms two or three weeks after testing positive.\nWhile research is still limited, many people who experience long-term symptoms say those include fatigue, difficulty breathing and body aches, among other symptoms.\nA study of 143 patients in Italy found that 87% of those who had recovered from COVID-19 reported at least one lingering symptom, USA Today reported Saturday.\n\u201cWe definitely see prolonged symptoms, sometimes a lingering cough and the most serious cases have long term chest pains and still feel they can\u2019t breathe well,\u201d Dr. Maja Artandi, medical director of an outpatient COVID-19 clinic at Stanford University hospital, told the publication. \u201cIt just causes all kinds of inflammation and takes awhile to heal.\u201d\n\u2015 Sebastian Murdock\nCalifornia Expands Essential Workers\u2019 Protections Amid Coronavirus Pandemic \u2014 7/24/20, 7 p.m. ET\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom announced additional\u00a0efforts to protect essential workers\u00a0as the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in the state continues to grow.\nAt Friday\u2019s press briefing, the Democratic governor said officials were creating\u00a0a new public information campaign\u00a0and handbook for employers to create safer, cleaner work environments. The state is also expanding workers\u2019 compensation and pandemic-related paid sick leave, as well as its programs providing rooms for infected workers to quarantine.\nThe governor noted that the coronavirus has gravely impacted essential workers, who are disproportionately from the Latinx community. Latinos make up 38% of California\u2019s population, but\u00a0more than half of those reporting COVID-19 infections\u00a0and 45% of deaths from the virus.\nCoronavirus\u00a0cases continue to balloon in California, which now has more than 425,000 confirmed cases total, a 7-day average of\u00a0daily cases amounting to over 9,800\u00a0\u2014 and over 8,000 people dead so far.\n\u2014 Sarah Ruiz-Grossman\nCoronavirus Vaccine Won\u2019t Be \u2018Widely Available\u2019 Until \u2018Several Months\u2019 Into Next Year, Says Fauci \u2014 07/24/2020; 2:30 p.m. ET\nA COVID-19 vaccine won\u2019t be \u201cwidely available\u201d in the U.S. until \u201cseveral months\u201d into 2021, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the country\u2019s top infectious disease expert, told The Washington Post\u2019s Robert Costa on Friday.\u00a0Fauci said, however, that \u201cwe will likely know whether a vaccine is safe and effective\u201d by the end of the year or early next year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPresident Trump has repeatedly said he expects a vaccine for the virus to be developed very soon.\u00a0\nFauci stressed that while a viable vaccine may indeed be found before the year\u2019s end, it wouldn\u2019t be until next year that such an intervention would be available to a wide swath of Americans.\n\u201cIt is likely that in the beginning of next year we would have tens of millions of doses available,\u201d\u00a0Fauci told Costa. \u201cThe companies who are involved in making these vaccines, many of which the federal government is in deep collaboration with, promised that as we get into 2021, there will be hundreds of millions of doses.

Since late May, Brazil has recorded more than 1,000 daily deaths on average in a plateau that has yet to tilt downward.\nHowever,\u00a0HuffPost Brazil reports\u00a0(in Portuguese) that a series of changes in the way the government reports coronavirus data has lead to doubts over the accuracy of the figures and to claims of underreporting.\nBrazil\u2019s President, Jair Bolsonaro, who has played down its health risks and fought against social distancing orders, remains in quarantine after testing positive for coronavirus a second time.\nPolls show Bolsonaro\u2019s popularity has been sinking during the pandemic.

The absence was first noticed Tuesday, according to a researcher\u00a0contacted by CNBC.\u00a0\nInstead of reporting key data points on testing, cases and supplies directly to the CDC, the Trump administration instructed hospitals to report their numbers to the Department of Health and Human Services beginning Wednesday. Critics said this gives the president more control over the official statistics, which he could potentially manipulate for political gain.\nThe White House contends that the new policy will streamline and speed up the process of gathering up-to-the-moment information on how the coronavirus crisis is impacting the nation. Press secretary Kayleigh McEnany defended it at a Thursday press conference, saying, \u201cThis is all about getting more data out there, not less data.\u201d\nThe hospitalization data reappeared Thursday afternoon.

Events and gatherings that take place indoors are limited to no more than 25 people, while outdoor events are limited to 250 people, including event staff.\nAll businesses are also encouraged to continue operating remotely, if possible.\n\u201cDuring the past week, we have seen an unsettling climb in new COVID-19 cases,\u201d Wolf said. \u201cWhen we hit our peak on April 9, we had nearly 2,000 new cases that day, with other days\u2019 cases hovering around 1,000.

The storm killed some two dozen people and left others homeless, just days before the state\u2019s first case of the coronavirus was identified in a nearby town and less than three weeks before Nashville\u2019s mayor would issue a \u201csafer at home\u201d order.The tornadoes destroyed large swaths of the historically Black neighborhoods of East Nashville and North Nashville, areas already struggling with\u00a0gentrification.\u201cWhen the pandemic was starting, a lot of people were out of their homes who were already pretty vulnerable and marginalized,\u201d said Aimi Hamraie, an associate professor of health, society and American studies at Nashville\u2019s Vanderbilt University.But they said,\u00a0\u201cVery quickly people were organizing to help get groceries, to get food to folks who needed it, and really coming together with their neighbors.\u201dPeople also chased away real estate developers who, within hours of the storm, had descended to snap up devastated properties, even as the owners still stood on their lawns, surveying the wreckage of their lives.About 20 people from around the city organized themselves into the Nashville Mutual Aid group and circulated a Google spreadsheet to connect people in need with neighbors who could help, offering rides to pick up groceries and prescriptions, child care, and more. There are now nearly 100 people on their listserv.\u00a0Hamraie, who is part of the group and whose research focuses on interdependence and collective care, said that members meet weekly via video chat to study the history and philosophy of mutual aid and solidarity movements. These discussions have grown only more topical during the protests sparked by the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis on May 25.\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019ve also talked about the roots of mutual aid and abolition work \u2014 efforts to go beyond just relying on the state for health and safety and security and actually create it in our own communities,\u201d they said.\u201cThe term \u2018mutual aid\u2019 basically just means when people band together to meet immediate survival needs, usually because of a shared understanding that the systems in place aren\u2019t coming to meet them, or certainly not fast enough,\u201d Dean Spade, an associate professor at Seattle University School of Law and one of the leading voices on mutual aid, explained recently on Democracy Now.Hyperlocal support networks have proliferated in recent months, evidenced by the scores of mutual aid Google docs, directories of docs, mutual aid 101 instructions and toolkits, Facebook groups, and Slack channels connecting people in need with people who can give. Aid has taken the form of running errands for people who\u2019ve lost income or been homebound during the pandemic. At Black Lives Matter protests, it\u2019s looked like snack stations, safe houses, bail funds and pepper spray relief.The community outpouring has been inspiring, but it betrays a troubling corollary: that people must find a way to provide for themselves because the nation has failed them. The confluence of the pandemic and the protests is highlighting how chronically under-resourced populations are disproportionately impacted by disasters and police violence. And in these populations, it has always been necessary to fill in the systemic gaps.\u00a0Even before the pandemic, a quarter of Americans were barely getting by, and now soaring unemployment is hitting Hispanic women, immigrants and people without college degrees particularly hard. More than 37 million people in the U.S. already struggled to feed their families \u2014 especially Black, Latinx and Indigenous households. The coronavirus has hugely increased levels of need. Food banks have been unable to keep up with the surge in demand and experts fear that the numbers of those experiencing food insecurity will rise by millions because of job losses.\u00a0The government\u2019s bumbling and inadequate response to the pandemic \u2014 on top of a crumbling health care infrastructure and weak social protections for workers \u2014 has created a survivalist need for communities to form their own networks of support.\u201cPart of the importance of mutual aid is also a critique of neglect of certain communities,\u201d said Paula Austin, assistant professor of history and African American studies at Boston University. \u201cI think that\u2019s why mutual aid is happening now, during the pandemic. Because it\u2019s clear that there are communities that have historically been neglected and we see that neglect brought into relief.\u201dThe tradition of mutual aid is at least as old as the country itself because social inequity is baked into the system. Austin pointed to efforts at the start of the 19th century when the first free Black communities were established in the Northeast. Legal freedom didn\u2019t necessarily translate into social, political and economic equality, she said, \u201cso we get these Black communities that form mutual relief and mutual aid societies.\u201dNoted abolitionist and local leader William Hamilton co-founded the New York African Society for Mutual Relief in 1808 (though it probably existed in secret before then). The organization collected dues to provide a form of health and life insurance to its members \u2015 prominent Black professionals \u2015 and their families, who otherwise wouldn\u2019t have access to such safety nets.\u00a0Throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries, mutual aid societies gave warm clothes and shoes to African American children so they could go to school in the winter, offered child care help to their mothers, and ran literacy classes and job training. Immigrants from Europe and China established networks of communal care, and \u201csociedades mutualistas\u201d\u00a0flourished\u00a0among Latin Americans in the Southwest.\u00a0Mutual aid has been and continues to be a crucial lifeline for many marginalized populations, including Indigenous people, people with disabilities and members of the LGBTQ community as well.\u00a0In addition to providing for unmet needs, mutual aid societies have been important political organizations, laying out the structural inequalities that left their communities without adequate social services in the first place.That was central to the mutual aid projects of the Black Panther Party in the 1960s, which included legal aid and children\u2019s education programs, health clinics, and free breakfasts for 20,000 children in 19 cities. \u201cAll these programs satisfy the deep needs of the community but they are not solutions to our problems,\u201d wrote\u00a0Black Panther co-founder Huey Newton. \u201cThat is why we call them survival programs, meaning survival pending revolution.\u201dAs Austin put it: \u201cWe\u2019re working on the revolution, but while we\u2019re working on the revolution, we need food and we need housing, and we need education and health care. We need all these things that our federal government is not providing.\u201dIt makes sense that mutual aid swells in times of acute crisis. Grassroots responses, what Hamraie referred to as \u201cthe people\u2019s infrastructure,\u201d can react more quickly to specific local needs than a legislative body allocating and distributing funds from afar.\u00a0What seems different right now, Hamraie observed, is that many more people \u201care showing up.\u201d Mutual aid has entered the mainstream in response to both the COVID-19 pandemic and the Black Lives Matter protests.\u00a0\u201cMarginalized people have been doing mutual aid forever,\u201d said Hamraie. Now, they said, people from a wide range of backgrounds are stepping up and speaking out who might never before have participated in activism. People are seeing that \u201cyou don\u2019t have to solely rely on appeals to your representatives. There are additional ways of creating the world that you want,\u201d Hamraie said.\u201cWe\u2019re seeing a kind of interracial, maybe even cross-class coalition building. And people thinking about, \u2018What are my personal resources and how can I use them to support other people, who I may or may not be an actual community with, during the pandemic?\u2019\u201d said Austin.She traced some of the current interracial organizing against anti-Black police violence back to the Occupy Wall Street protests, when many young, predominantly white people became politicized around issues of systemic economic inequalities.Alex Gitterman, a professor at the University of Connecticut School of Social Work, said he is reminded of the civil rights movement in the 1960s. \u201cWe were always on a picket line, on the protest line, and the climate was right for it,\u201d he recalled. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen that for 60 years. So I\u2019ve got my fingers crossed.\u201dGitterman helped develop a model for social work within groups of people that applies the central concepts of mutual aid. The process enables group members to help one another deal with common life and environmental stressors. It \u201dreduces isolation, de-pathologizes problems and diminishes stigma,\u201d he explained.He observed that shared experience makes people more likely to come together for a common purpose and impels them to action. But a little heterogeneity in the group, some different perspective, has the potential to create even deeper impact, he said.People coalescing around a cause that may not affect them directly is an extension \u2015 and an expansion \u2015 of a long tradition of mutual aid. \u201cOne way to think about it is the difference between mutual aid for self-determination\u201d \u2014 as seen in historically underserved communities creating their own networks of support \u2014 \u201cand mutual aid for solidarity,\u201d Hamraie said.\u00a0It\u2019s not just about giving, but about joining together. One of the central tenets of mutual aid is \u201csolidarity, not charity.\u201dHow to maintain that distinction when their members have varying levels of privilege and need is something that Hamraie and others in their collective discuss in their weekly chats. And they recognize that even being able to join those calls requires access \u2014 to a computer, internet, free time \u2014 that not everyone has.Activists will have to probe these difficult questions as new and expanding networks strive to keep the mutual aid momentum going.\u00a0\u201cI believe the generosity and solidarity in action in the present moment offers a foreshadowing of what is possible \u2015 and necessary,\u201d Rebecca Solnit wrote in The Guardian about mutual aid responses to the coronavirus. She went on to say, \u201cSome of that sense of urgency and shared destiny will fade away, as it often does after a disaster, but one of the important things to remember is that some of it was here before this pandemic.\u201dWhether it\u2019s the 2020s, the 1960s or the 1800s, the dire need for mutual aid exposes the failings of a system that has never provided equally for all people. The question now is whether the groundswell will finally shift the landscape in a meaningful way.\u00a0\u201cThe revealing of underbelly is always good, but I\u2019m worried that at some point there will be a rolling back from the reveal. I worry that we won\u2019t actually make some necessary fixes,\u201d Austin said. \u201cI\u2019m hopeful and simultaneously worried.\u201dFor more content and to be part of the \u201cThis New World\u201d community, follow our Facebook page.HuffPost\u2019s \u201cThis New World\u201d series is funded by Partners for a New Economy and the Kendeda Fund.

There are additional ways of creating the world that you want,\u201d Hamraie said.\u201cWe\u2019re seeing a kind of interracial, maybe even cross-class coalition building. And people thinking about, \u2018What are my personal resources and how can I use them to support other people, who I may or may not be an actual community with, during the pandemic?\u2019\u201d said Austin.She traced some of the current interracial organizing against anti-Black police violence back to the Occupy Wall Street protests, when many young, predominantly white people became politicized around issues of systemic economic inequalities.Alex Gitterman, a professor at the University of Connecticut School of Social Work, said he is reminded of the civil rights movement in the 1960s. \u201cWe were always on a picket line, on the protest line, and the climate was right for it,\u201d he recalled. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen that for 60 years. So I\u2019ve got my fingers crossed.\u201dGitterman helped develop a model for social work within groups of people that applies the central concepts of mutual aid. The process enables group members to help one another deal with common life and environmental stressors. It \u201dreduces isolation, de-pathologizes problems and diminishes stigma,\u201d he explained.He observed that shared experience makes people more likely to come together for a common purpose and impels them to action. But a little heterogeneity in the group, some different perspective, has the potential to create even deeper impact, he said.People coalescing around a cause that may not affect them directly is an extension \u2015 and an expansion \u2015 of a long tradition of mutual aid. \u201cOne way to think about it is the difference between mutual aid for self-determination\u201d \u2014 as seen in historically underserved communities creating their own networks of support \u2014 \u201cand mutual aid for solidarity,\u201d Hamraie said.\u00a0It\u2019s not just about giving, but about joining together. One of the central tenets of mutual aid is \u201csolidarity, not charity.\u201dHow to maintain that distinction when their members have varying levels of privilege and need is something that Hamraie and others in their collective discuss in their weekly chats. And they recognize that even being able to join those calls requires access \u2014 to a computer, internet, free time \u2014 that not everyone has.Activists will have to probe these difficult questions as new and expanding networks strive to keep the mutual aid momentum going.\u00a0\u201cI believe the generosity and solidarity in action in the present moment offers a foreshadowing of what is possible \u2015 and necessary,\u201d Rebecca Solnit wrote in The Guardian about mutual aid responses to the coronavirus. She went on to say, \u201cSome of that sense of urgency and shared destiny will fade away, as it often does after a disaster, but one of the important things to remember is that some of it was here before this pandemic.\u201dWhether it\u2019s the 2020s, the 1960s or the 1800s, the dire need for mutual aid exposes the failings of a system that has never provided equally for all people. The question now is whether the groundswell will finally shift the landscape in a meaningful way.\u00a0\u201cThe revealing of underbelly is always good, but I\u2019m worried that at some point there will be a rolling back from the reveal. I worry that we won\u2019t actually make some necessary fixes,\u201d Austin said. \u201cI\u2019m hopeful and simultaneously worried.\u201dFor more content and to be part of the \u201cThis New World\u201d community, follow our Facebook page.HuffPost\u2019s \u201cThis New World\u201d series is funded by Partners for a New Economy and the Kendeda Fund.
