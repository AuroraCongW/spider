is to achieve the ultimate goal of\u2026resisting every policy initiative of Hong Kong as their government, then it may fall into the category of subverting the state power -- which is now one of the four types of offenses under the new national security law,\u201d Lam \u00a0 in response to the elections.The recent primary election had a reported turnout of 600,000 voters, which will select representatives from five different regions to run for Hong Kong\u2019s Legislation Council on Sept. 6, according to the .\u201cI warmly congratulate Hong Kong\u2019s pan-democrats for their successful primary election,\u201d  said Tuesday. \u201cTheir enthusiasm clearly demonstrates their desire to make their voices heard in the face of the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s efforts to suffocate the territory\u2019s freedoms.\u201dIn a press conference Monday, Lam said that the primary elections were not a legitimate part of the election system in Hong Kong.Lam then said that the government received many complaints about the recent elections, and cited law 599G which prohibits \u201cgroup gatherings of more than 50 people.\u201d She said this was a factor in the investigation the government will now open on this weekend\u2019s primary election.She also said that the primary election is an \"unfairness\"\u00a0to the September 6 election and\u00a0potentially breached\u00a0the \u201cprivacy commission\u201d -- though she did not expand on how privacy was violated. \u201cIf we discover there is sufficient evidence to take action, we will take action,\u201d Lam said Monday.The new security laws have criminalized secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces, with sentences of up to life in prison for those who are found guilty.Pro-democracy protesters have been arrested for waiving Hong Kong Independence flags and demonstrating against mainland China\u2019s attempts to gain control in the once semi-autonomous region.The U.S. has implemented policy changes, such as rolling back Hong Kong\u2019s Special Status -- which meant the U.S. recognized Hong Kong as separate from China and allowed for benefits largely through trade and economics, meaning that Hong Kong was not affected by the U.S.-China trade war.\u201cWe note with grave concern Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam\u2019s threat that this primary may have violated Beijing\u2019s new \u2018national security\u2019 law for the territory, once again demonstrating the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s fear of democracy and its own

\"anger\" over the lockdowns, \"anxiousness\" about an uncertain , and \"fear of getting the virus\" has led to disunity and national unrest.\"And then, you\u2019ve got these radical\u00a0elements

what we have to do is unite\u00a0around this central fact: China\u00a0lied; people died.\u00a0The CCP lied; Americans died,\" Navarro reiterated.In order to do so, he told Hegseth that Americans need to unite on \"literally making [the Chinese Communist Party] pay for that.\"\"They also have to come clean on\u00a0exactly what they\u2019ve been\u00a0doing with that virus.\u00a0Is it an engineered

The court documents contained similar evidence against several other Chinese scientists.Chen Song, for example,\u00a0was an \"active duty People's Liberation Army\u00a0military scientist who lied to get into the United States, attempted to destroy evidence\u00a0and lied extensively to the FBI when interviewed,\" the government wrote in charging documents.\"Defendant\u2019s case is not an isolated one, but instead appears to be part of a program conducted by the PLA\u2014and specifically, FMMU or associated institutions\u2014to send military scientists to the United States on false pretenses with false covers or false statements about their true employment,\" the FBI said, referring to Chen Song. Another case involves a suspected spy working for UCSF.Meanwhile, the United States ordered China to close its consulate in Houston, escalating tensions between the world\u2019s largest economies as President Trump has ramped up punitive measures against China ahead of the November U.S. election. Beijing denounced the order Wednesday as \"outrageous\" and claimed it would draw a firm response if not reversed.The physical closure of the consulate, one of China's six missions in the United States, marked a dramatic step in increasingly contentious relations that have been strained not only by the coronavirus pandemic but also by disputes over trade, human rights, Hong Kong and Chinese assertiveness in the South China Sea.Previous Trump administration measures against Chinese officials, students and researchers have included travel bans, registration requirements and other steps intended to reduce the country's footprint in the United States. The administration also has announced its outright rejection of virtually all Chinese maritime claims in the South China Sea.These actions have come as Trump has sought to blame China for the coronavirus outbreak in the U.S., where cases have soared. Trump himself said more closures could be coming if China didn't change its behavior. \"It's always possible,\" he told reporters at the White House.The State Department announced it ordered the consulate closed within 72 hours after alleging that Chinese agents have tried to steal data from facilities in Texas, including the Texas A&M medical system statewide and The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston.There were indications consulate staff were preparing to leave: Papers were being burned on the consulate grounds late Tuesday night \u2014 a common practice when a diplomatic post is being shuttered on short notice.Cai Wei, the Chinese consul general, told KTRK-TV in Houston the order to shut down was \"quite wrong\" and \"very damaging\" to U.S.-China relations.Asked about accusations of espionage and stealing data, Cai said, \"You have to give some evidence, say something from the facts. ... Knowing Americans, you have the rule of law, you are not guilty until you are proved guilty.\"State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus said in a statement that the closure was \"to protect American intellectual property and Americans' private information.\"\"The United States will not tolerate (China's) violations of our sovereignty and intimidation of our people, just as we have not tolerated (China's) unfair trade practices, theft of American jobs, and other egregious behavior,\" she said.Testifying before Congress on Wednesday, Deputy Secretary of State Stephen Biegun lamented that relations today have been \"weighed down by a growing number of disputes,\" including commercial espionage, intellectual property theft and unequal treatment of diplomats, businesses and journalists.Those factors led to Trump's action, he told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.The Justice Department on Tuesday had announced the indictments of two Chinese hackers on charges of trying to steal pharmaceutical secrets from U.S. companies related to the COVID-19 pandemic that originated in China. Although there was no indication the indictments and the consulate action were related, the U.S. has long alleged China has been involved in nefarious activity around the country, including from its Houston consulate.Even before the U.S. announced the closure, which was conveyed privately to the Chinese ambassador on Tuesday, China strongly condemned it.\"The unilateral closure of China\u2019s consulate general in Houston within a short period of time is an unprecedented escalation of its recent actions against China,\" Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said. He warned of firm countermeasures if the U.S. did not reverse itself.Wang accused the U.S. of opening Chinese diplomatic pouches without permission multiple times, confiscating Chinese items for official use and imposing restrictions on Chinese diplomats beginning last October and again in June. He also said U.S. diplomats in China engaged in infiltration activities.In Houston, firefighters responded to reports of papers being burned on the consulate grounds Tuesday night but were barred entry. On Wednesday afternoon, consulate staff could be seen loading cleaning supplies and paper products into a van parked outside the building. A U-Haul truck was also parked outside the consulateFirst responders \"were told that people inside the consulate, that they were burning paperwork because they were in the process of being evacuated from the building,\" Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner said.Foreign diplomatic missions have operated under legal immunities accorded by international law and may not be entered without permission. However, the destruction of confidential documents at a facility that has been ordered or otherwise forced to close on short notice, including U.S. missions, was not unusual. Most recently in the United States, Russia's consulate in San Francisco made news for burning large amounts of material when it was ordered closed in 2017.Aside from the diplomatic ramifications, the closure of the Houston consulate could make it more difficult for China to provide assistance to its citizens in the southern United States and for U.S. nationals seeking visas and other services there.In addition to its embassy in Washington and its mission to the United Nations in New York, China has\u00a0consulates in New York, Chicago and Los Angeles. In an apparent bid to stave off the reciprocal closure of an American diplomatic mission in China, the State Department told the Chinese that it would not reopen its consulate in Wuhan, two U.S. officials who were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly told The Associated Press anonymously.The U.S. consulate in Wuhan was shuttered in late January at the height of the coronavirus outbreak that started there, but the State Department had informed Congress in early June that it planned to reopen it, possibly this summer.Besides Wuhan, the U.S. has four other consulates in China \u2014 in Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chengdu and Shenyang \u2014 along with its embassy in Beijing and a consulate general in Hong Kong.In a reflection of China\u2019s economic importance, a Houston business group expressed regret at the announcement, saying the consulate has been important in building trade, investment and cultural ties. It noted that the Houston consulate was China\u2019s first in the U.S. when it opened in 1979.", "comment": "(4,690)", "topic": "China", "date": " July 22"}, {"cover":

kept interfering in the issue.\u201d\u201cUnder the pretext of preserving stability, it is flexing muscles, stirring up tension and inciting confrontation in the region,\u201d the embassy

U.S. has reported nearly 3.4 million cases to date and over 136,000 deaths according to  data.Diplomatic relations have further strained due to China\u2019s new security laws in Hong Kong, their refusal to sign a nuclear arms trade deal with the U.S. and Russia, as well as in the race to 5G -- in what the U.S. has said would be a massive security threat if China is the first to succeed in its

Development Program (UNDP), was announced  as the co-chair of WHO\u2019s Independent Panel for Pandemic Preparedness and Response (IPPR) along with\u00a0former President of Liberia Ellen Johnson Sirleaf.\u00a0Clark was tipped as a top contender for the role of U.N. Secretary-General in 2016.But in an interview in April with , she criticized the U.S. decision to leave the body, a move made over concerns WHO was too close to Beijing,\u00a0as \"foolish.\"\u201cTo withdraw funding from the World Health Organization in the middle of a pandemic is clearly foolish,\" she said in an interview, flagged by journalist Sara Carter.\u00a0\"About 15 percent of the WHO's\u00a0budget comes from the United States of America\u00a0and actually the biggest share of that funding goes to very important programs, like the eradication of polio.\"She also appeared to knock the U.S. for its demand that a  on the virus explicitly include a mention of the Chinese origins of the virus.\"If you, as\u00a0a major country with\u00a0a veto power on the Security Council,\u00a0enter the room with the attitude that you are determined to have in the resolution\u00a0a name for\u00a0the virus which\u00a0is not the scientific name but the name of the place where the virus came from, then you know you\u00a0don't really want a resolution, you're just entering a blame game.\"This week, in an interview with , she said it was \"very distressing\" that the U.S. had left, and said she hoped that the U.S. would reenter the organization.\"I don't think these decisions are forever, and I very much hope we'll see the U.S. back in there, playing the role that it's traditionally played,\" she said.Clark has raised concerns from U.N. critics over past comments she has made in relation to the virus. In March, she tweeted about Cuba\u2019s response:\"#Cuba is known globally for its willingness to send health professional teams to the most challenging emergencies. Full marks to it for sending personnel to #Covid_19 - stricken #Italy\u201dFor that, she attracted the ire of U.N.\u00a0Watch, a Geneva-based watchdog: \u201cHelen Clark has an attraction to Communist dictatorships. Here she is showering praise on Cuba's Communist regime for sending doctors abroad.\u201dIt\u2019s also accused her of being \u00a0as well as WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. But in remarks in May, Clark was critical of the\u00a0Chinese response and said it took seven days after Chinese officials determined the virus was a \u201chuge threat\u201d to warn their\u00a0people.\u201cIn that seven days, millions began traveling for the Lunar New Year and in Wuhan...there were thousands of people at mass events, so this is pretty disturbing,\" she said on .\u201cIf you want to be a great power that is respected, and fear doesn\u2019t bring respect, then you have to be upfront\u00a0as utterly transparent with the international community,\" she said.She also expressed concern about countries allowing Huawei access to their systems, saying it appeared to be approved on cost, rather than for security reasons. But she also stood by her decision as prime minister to make New Zealand the first country to sign a free trade deal with China.\u201cTo those who criticize efforts to bring China into the international\u00a0rules-based trading order, I would ask, well what\u2019s the alternative?\" she asked. \"To have them operating out there outside the multilateral rules framework?

They're not looking into any of his history.\u201dHe added: \u201cThey want to do whatever they can to keep the American people from actually seeing Biden. He hasn't been defined. And the media is trying to make sure that no one gets to define Joe Biden, because once he is, you'll see how terrible this notion could be for America.\u201dWhile the polling gap between Trump and Biden has narrowed a bit since the former vice president held a double-digit led over the current White House occupant late last month, a RealClearPolitics average of polls still has Biden up nine points on the president with less than five months to go before November\u2019s general election.Trump Jr. also hit Biden on the Democratic candidate\u2019s recently released \u201cBuild Back Better\u201d plan, which proposes spending $700 billion on American products and research -- in the hopes of bringing back millions of jobs lost by an economy flattened by the coronavirus pandemic.\u201cYou know that Joe Biden can sell this notion of \u2018now we're going to be buy American after 50 years of legislation that sent our jobs, that sent our American Dream to China,\u2019\u201d Trump Jr. said. \u201cIt's asinine.\u201dTrump Jr. also accused Biden of using his time in public office to enrich his own family and once again questioned why the media isn\u2019t looking into the matter. \u201cI called it liberal privilege because we hear a lot about privilege these days, but liberal privilege is the ultimate because they can say one thing, do the other and never get called on it,\u201d he said. In an interview earlier this year, Trump Jr. called out Hunter Biden's business deals in Ukraine while his father was vice president.\n\u201cI was an international business person before my father got into politics. That\u2019s what we did. I\u2019m not going to say I haven\u2019t benefited from my father\u2019s last name, just like Hunter Biden did. That\u2019d be foolish to say,\u201d Trump Jr. said during an interview with Axios in March. \u201cBut, I haven\u2019t benefited from my father\u2019s taxpayer-funded office.\u201d\u201cAll of the sudden, he [Hunter Biden] goes over to the Ukraine and he\u2019s making 83K a month, so the media likes to do this, sort of false equivalence. \u2018You\u2019re doing this, you\u2019re doing that,\u201d Trump Jr. said at the time. \u201cWe stopped doing any new international business deals when my father won the presidency.\u201dJoe Biden on Thursday introduced his plan that also seeks to create 5 million new jobs and is the first of four\u00a0economic proposals Biden is\u00a0expected to roll out over the coming weeks.The American-centric proposals spotlighted by Biden will compete in this year\u2019s White House race with the \u201cAmerica first\u201d agenda long pushed by Trump, who has emphasized protecting American workers and reenergizing domestic industries in decline while moving away from free trade and a global economy.The first part of the former vice president's proposal is a $400 billion investment by the federal government to purchase\u00a0American products such as cement, concrete, steel, and other materials to rebuild the nation\u2019s crumbling infrastructure.The second part is a $300 billion investment in research for new technologies, such as electric vehicles, artificial intelligence, and 5G.Biden\u2019s plan also calls for new tax breaks and credits for small manufacturers \u2013 including those run by minorities and women \u2013\u00a0and would levy\u00a0penalties on\u00a0companies who take\u00a0federal money and then\u00a0move their investments overseas. The campaign says that Biden will also push federal investments toward\u00a0overlooked parts of the country that have not\u00a0received government help.Biden\u2019s proposals appear to be an acknowledgment of the political success the president has enjoyed pushing his \u201cAmerica First\u201d agenda. Trump's victory in the 2016 presidential election was in part due to his promises of bringing back American jobs and re-inflating flagging industries.

But it will almost certainly have the more immediate effect of further infuriating the Chinese, who are already retaliating against numerous U.S. sanctions and other penalties on other matters.It also comes as President Trump has come under growing fire for his response to the COVID-19 pandemic, stepped up criticism of China ahead of the 2020 election and sought to paint his expected Democratic challenger, former Vice President Joe Biden, as weak on China.\u201cToday we are strengthening U.S. policy in a vital, contentious part of that region -- the South China Sea,\u201d Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a press release. \u201cWe are making clear: Beijing\u2019s claims to offshore resources across most of the South China Sea are completely unlawful, as is its campaign of bullying to control them.\u201dPompeo added: \u201cBeijing uses intimidation to undermine the sovereign rights of Southeast Asian coastal states in the South China Sea, bully them out of offshore resources, assert unilateral dominion, and replace international law with \u2018might makes right.\u2019\u201dPreviously, U.S. policy had been to insist that maritime disputes between China and its smaller neighbors be resolved peacefully through U.N.-backed arbitration. But in a statement released Monday, Pompeo said the U.S. now regards virtually all Chinese maritime claims outside its internationally recognized waters to be illegitimate. The shift does not involve disputes over land features that are above sea level, which are considered to be \"territorial\" in nature.Although the U.S. will continue to remain neutral in territorial disputes, the announcement means the administration is in effect siding with Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Vietnam, all of which oppose Chinese assertions of sovereignty over maritime areas surrounding contested islands, reefs and shoals.\u201cThere are clear cases where [China]\u00a0is claiming sovereignty over areas that no country can lawfully claim,\u201d the State Department said in a fact sheet that accompanied the statement.The announcement was released a day after the fourth anniversary of a binding decision by an arbitration panel in favor of the Philippines that rejected China's maritime claims around the Spratly Islands and neighboring reefs and shoals.China has refused to recognize that decision, which it has dismissed as a \u201csham,\u201d and refused to participate in the arbitration proceedings. It has continued to defy the decision with aggressive actions that have brought it into territorial spats with Vietnam, the Philippines and Malaysia in recent years.However, as a result, the administration says China has no valid maritime claims to the fish- and potentially energy-rich Scarborough Reef, Mischief Reef or Second Thomas Shoal. The U.S. has repeatedly said that areas regarded to be part of the Philippines are covered by a U.S.-Philippines mutual defense treaty in the event of an attack on them.In addition to reiterating support for that decision, Pompeo said China cannot legally claim the James Shoal near Malaysia, waters surrounding the Vanguard Bank off Vietnam, the Luconia Shoals near Brunei and Natuna Besar off Indonesia. As such, it says the U.S. will regard any Chinese harassment of fishing vessels or oil exploration in those areas as unlawful.The announcement came amid heightened tensions between the U.S. and China over numerous issues, including the coronavirus pandemic, human rights, Chinese policy in Hong Kong and Tibet and trade, that have sent relations plummeting in recent months.But the practical impact wasn't immediately clear. The U.S. is not a party of the U.N. Law of the Sea treaty that sets out a mechanism for the resolution of disputes. Despite that, the State Department noted that China and its neighbors, including the Philippines, are parties to the treaty and should respect the decision.China has sought to shore up its claim to the sea by building military bases on coral atolls, leading the U.S. to sail its warships through the region in what it calls freedom of operation missions. The United States has no claims itself to the waters but has deployed warships and aircraft for decades to patrol and promote freedom of navigation and overflight in the busy waterway.Last week, China angrily complained about the U.S. flexing its military muscle in the South China Sea by conducting joint exercises with two U.S. aircraft carrier groups in the strategic waterway. The Navy said the USS Nimitz and the USS Ronald Reagan, along with their accompanying vessels and aircraft, conducted exercises \u201cdesigned to maximize air defense capabilities, and extend the reach of long-range precision maritime strikes from carrier-based aircraft in a rapidly evolving area of operations.\u201dChina claims almost all of the South China Sea and routinely objects to any action by the U.S. military in the region.

The act imposes sanctions on entities that help violate Hong Kong's autonomy and financial institutions that do business with them, and comes as a response to the passage of a \"national security\" law that tightened Beijing's grip on Hong Kong \u2014 which has been semi-autonomous from the mainland since 1997.The Chinese law, implemented earlier this summer, says that those who destroy government facilities and utilities would be considered subversive. Damaging public transportation facilities and arson would constitute acts of terrorism. Any person taking part in secessionist activities, whether organizing or participating, would violate the law regardless of whether violence is used.It comes after a full year of pro-democracy protests in the former British territory that was handed over to China 23 years ago on the condition that it would keep\u00a0a high degree of autonomy from mainland China and a British-style rule of law \u2014\u00a0a \"one country, two systems\" framework. China has slowly encroached on Hong Kong's autonomy, leading U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo early this year to declare that it is \"no longer autonomous.\"The new law prohibits what Beijing views as secessionist, subversive or terrorist activities or as foreign intervention in Hong Kong affairs and is seen as a direct response to the protest\u2019s calls for democracy. Under the law, police now have sweeping powers to conduct searches without warrants and order internet service providers and platforms to remove messages deemed to be in violation of the legislation.With Trump\u2019s executive order, exports from Hong Kong will be subject to the same tariffs the White House has imposed on goods from mainland China \u2013 marking a blow for leaders in Beijing as they struggle to revamp their economy amid the coronavirus pandemic and cutting off a lucrative loophole. The announcement from Trump also comes a day after the White House rejected nearly all of\u00a0\u2019s claims in the contested South China Sea.The administration presented the decision as an attempt to curb China\u2019s increasing assertiveness in the region with a commitment to recognizing international law. But it will almost certainly have the more immediate effect of further infuriating the Chinese, who are already retaliating against numerous U.S. sanctions and other penalties on other matters.Ties between China and the U.S. have deteriorated steadily over the coronavirus pandemic, human rights, Beijing policy toward Hong Kong and trade. The Trump administration has also slapped visa bans on Chinese officials deemed responsible for barring foreigners\u2019 access to Tibet, along with those seen as enforcing a clampdown on civil rights in Hong Kong.Tensions ratcheted up in the last few days with the actions taken by both the U.S. and China.On Monday, China said\u00a0it will impose sanctions on three U.S. lawmakers and one ambassador in response to similar actions taken by the U.S. last week against Chinese officials over alleged human rights abuses against Muslims in the Xinjiang region.U.S. Senators Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz, Rep. Chris Smith and Ambassador for Religious Freedom Sam Brownback were targeted, as was the Congressional-Executive Commission on China.

This action is intended to send the world a message: Fear us.The free  response should be to man up.Beijing\u2019s action came after recent U.S. legislation calling for sanctions on Chinese officials over their systematic abuse of the Uighurs and other Muslim minorities. We\u2019re talking about systematic and horrific  violations, including the mass detention of over a million Chinese citizens, religious persecution, exploitation of slave labor and forced sterilization.Last week, these inhumane practices led the Trump administration to impose sanctions on four individuals, including Politburo member Chen Quanguo, the highest-ranking Chinese official ever called out by Washington. Chen is also Party secretary of Xinjiang Province, where the Uighur detention camps are located.\u00a0The other three officials sanctioned are also tied to Xinjiang.China announced its \u201c\u201d on Monday. Three of those targeted are Sens. Ted Cruz,\u00a0R-Texas,\u00a0and Marco Rubio,\u00a0R-Fla.,\u00a0and Rep. Chris Smith,\u00a0R-N.J., who led the legislative efforts to punish Beijing. Also named by Beijing were U.S. Ambassador for International Religious Freedom Sam Brownback and members of the Congressional-Executive Commission on China.This is not just Beijing playing tit-for-tat with Washington. The Chinese action comes on the heels of  that significantly restricts the economic and political freedoms long enjoyed by the people of Hong Kong. The Chinese regime has also engaged in an aggressive diplomatic and propaganda effort during the COVID-19 crisis, evading responsibilities for its own failures, while threatening other nations for not siding with China.The highly hostile approach now being pursued by Beijing is popularly called \u201cwolf warrior\u201d diplomacy. The moniker refers to a series of Chinese films in which a Rambo-like character runs around the world thwarting \u201cevil\u201d capitalist designs.The real question is whether wolf warrior diplomacy is an act of strength or weakness. After all, the Soviet Union unveiled their Rambo-esque character in a film which premiered less than four years before the evil empire collapsed.But no matter whether it driven by insecurity or overconfidence, China\u2019s increasingly intimidating stance is a problem the United States will have to deal with.America\u2019s response ought to focus on the target for Beijing\u2019s temper tantrum \u2014 and it is probably not America. In practice, China has had no luck bullying this administration. From increasing freedom of navigation operations in the South China Seas to upping support for Taiwan, action on trade and calling out Beijing\u2019s abuse of the World Health Organization, when Beijing has pushed, the U.S. has pushed back harder.America can get away with bumping heads with Beijing. We are a superpower.China\u2019s sanctions aren\u2019t so much designed to push against an immovable geo-political object as they are trying to flow around U.S. power and intimidate others. There is little likelihood, they\u2019ll ever try to extradite Cruz or Rubio.\u00a0No, they want to send a message to others.Kicking sand in the face of American officials is the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s not-so-subtle warning that they are willing to go after anyone who gets in their way \u2014 and the weaker and meeker their opponents are, the harder China will squeeze.When it comes to battling wolf warrior diplomacy, the free world has to stand together. Otherwise China will use its divide-and-overwhelm strategy to pick the free world apart.Standing together will require American leadership, and it deserves strong, bipartisan support here at home. This is an issue where contemporary Washington politics of \u201cif Trump is for it, we are against it\u201d must be put aside. If we can\u2019t pull together on this one, we can\u2019t lead.Next, we are going to have to tell our friends and allies the hard truth: a country that wants to be part of the free world must stand with the free world in pushing back China\u2019s destabilizing actions that undermine our security, prosperity and values. They are going to have to carry their fair share of the load.Finally, we have to make the free world stronger. The tougher we are to take out, the more likely China is to back down. We have to recommit to collective defense. We have to partner in jumpstarting our economies so we can recover faster and stronger after the COVID-19 crisis.

The law gives police greater power to crack down on any activity there that authorities deem subversive with secessionist aims.Trump added that the State Department's travel advisory for Hong Kong would be revised to reflect the increased danger of surveillance and punishment by the Chinese. Additionally, the U.S. is revoking Hong Kong's preferential treatment as a separate customs and travel territory, and taking steps to sanction officials involved in eroding Hong Kong's autonomy.Trump announced in April , and threatened to make the freeze permanent if the organization did not enact \"major substantive reforms.\" The U.S. had been the top contributor to the agency to the tune of approximately $450 million a year.

The New Strategic Arms Reduction\u00a0Treaty (START), which was signed in 2010 by former President Barack Obama and then Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, was made in accordance with the original nuclear arms deal from 1987 and worked to further eliminate the creation and stockpiles of nuclear arms.President Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin pulled out of the 1987 nuclear arms treaty last year, leaving the START treaty as the only nuclear non-proliferation agreement between the two countries.Should the treaty expire, it would be the first time the U.S. and Russia were not united in a nuclear arms agreement since the Cold War.Lavrov said that Russia would be willing to extend the treaty which is set to expire in Feb. 2021 without contingencies, but the U.S. is demanding that China sign the new agreement as well.China has repeatedly said they will not enter into an agreement that requires they reduce their nuclear arms.\u201cThe U.S. has conducted more nuclear testing than others, over a thousand at home and abroad, causing unspeakable damage to other countries' ecological environment,\u201d Hua said Friday. \u201cBy dragging China into this issue, it seeks to let itself off the hook and out of the straitjacket.\u201dShe added that China was one of the first signatories of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, an agreement that bans all testing of nuclear weapons, in 1996. \u201cWe hope the U.S. will stop playing dumb,\u201d Hua said from Friday\u2019s press conference.\u201cWith the largest nuclear arsenal, the US should respond to international concern, earnestly fulfill its special and primary responsibilities to nuclear disarmament, respond positively to Russia's call on extending the New START and further drastically reduce its nuclear arms stockpile.\u201d", "comment": "", "topic": "China", "date": " July 17"}, {"cover": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/07/156/88/John-Berman-Peter-Navarro-AP.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "title": "CNN's John Berman scolds Peter Navarro for using term 'China virus'", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/media/cnn-john-berman-peter-navarro-china-virus", "subtitle": "CNN anchor John Berman had a contentious exchange with\u00a0White House trade adviser\u00a0Peter Navarro\u00a0over his terminology of the coronavirus outbreak.\u00a0", "keyword": "U.S.-China trade and COVID-19", "website": "Fox News", "author": "Joseph A.

Thank you. Thank you, Dana. Good evening. Welcome to Washington, I'm Bret Baier. Breaking tonight, how to get students back to school safely amid the coronavirus pandemic? The president and first lady participating in what was billed as a national dialogue on the subject earlier today. Vice President Mike Pence was also there. I will speak exclusively with the president's point man on the coronavirus in just a few minutes. We have Fox team coverage, Jonathan Serrie in Atlanta as operation warp speed is getting a big cash infusion in the search for a vaccine, but we begin with correspondent Kristin Fisher at the White House and the effort to get kids back to school on time and out of danger. Good evening, Kristin. KRISTIN FISHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Good evening, Bret. Today we saw an administration-wide push to get schools reopened this fall. They say for the good of students, parents, and the entire U.S. economy. President Trump has been very clear where he stands on this issue but today he took a nap -- took it up a notch and explicitly said that he is going to be pressuring governors across the country to get on board. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: They think it's going to be good for them politically, so they keep the schools close, no way. So we're very much going to put pressure on governors and everybody else to open the schools. FISHER: President Trump is urging governors across the country to follow the lead of Florida Governor Ron DeSantis whose administration has just ordered that all schools reopen in August. During a day-long panel discussion, administration officials from Doctor Deborah Birx to Education Secretary Betsy DeVos made the case that the risk of reopening outweighs the benefits of keeping children home. DR. DEBORAH BIRX, CORONAVIRUS RESPONSE COORDINATOR, WHITE HOUSE: In the rush to just close things down, there was not -- everything was not completely considered in that moment about how we were going to protect our children. BETSY DEVOS, UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF EDUCATION: We can't overstate the importance of the need for schools to be open again and for students to have that opportunity to learn together in person. FISHER: To help make their case, the administration is pointing to the American Academy of Pediatrics which strongly advocates that all policy considerations for the coming school year should start with a goal of having students physically present in school. And in New York City, the vast majority of parents pulled in a survey agreed. BILL DE BLASIO (D), MAYOR OF NEW YORK: 400,000 families responded, I've never heard anything like that and 75 percent of them want their kids back in school in September. FISHER: But other parents are concerned about their children catching the coronavirus in school and spreading it to loved ones in the at-risk age group and some teachers are worried, too. On the opposite end of the spectrum from what Florida is doing, Harvard University just announced that all classes will be online for the entire school year until the spring of 2021 and there are several hybrid options in between. So there is a huge range for educators and parents to consider as they brace for a possible second wave in the fall. DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH: We are still knee-deep in the first wave of this and I would say this would not be considered a wave, it was a surge or a resurgence of infections. (END VIDEOTAPE) FISHER: And today, the World Health Organization announced that they believe that the coronavirus pandemic is accelerating. The same day that President Trump officially pulled out of the organization. Joe Biden though, he is now promising to rejoin the WHO on day one in the White House if, of course, he wins, Bret. BAIER: Kristin Fisher live on the North Lawn. Kristin, thank you. The government is pouring another $1.6 billion to try to develop a vaccine for the coronavirus. Also tonight, more than four dozen hospitals in Florida are reporting that their intensive care units have now reached capacity. Correspondent Jonathan Serrie reports tonight from Atlanta. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JONATHAN SERRIE, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT: As new coronavirus cases surge across the south and west, nearly one in every 100 Floridians has now been infected. Starting Wednesday, Miami-Dade County will suspend short-term vacation rentals and indoor dining at restaurants. JOHNNY CARDONA, MENSWEAR STORE MANAGER: We might be getting lockdown for another three month. What's going to happen to this business owner? We don't know. SERRIE: After meeting with health advisors, the mayor tweeted, we arrived at a compromise to keep gyms and fitness studios open. All doing activities inside must wear a mask or do strenuous training outside staying 10 feet apart without mask. In hard-hit Texas, organizers of the state fair which drew more than 2-1/2 million visitors last year, announced they're canceling the event for the first time since World War II. In New York, state health officials issued a report suggesting Governor Andrew Cuomo's controversial and now discontinued policy requiring nursing homes to accept COVID-19 patients discharged from hospitals was not a significant factor in spreading the virus. Instead, the primary sources were infected visitors and staffers, many with no symptoms. DR. HOWARD ZUCKER, NEW YORK STATE HEALTH COMMISSIONER: The employee infections were related to the larger community spread and employee transmission has the strongest correlation to a nursing home fatalities. Admission policies were not a significant factor in nursing home fatalities. SERRIE: The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and Department of Defense announced a $1.6 billion agreement with pharmaceutical company Novavax to speed research and development of a potential COVID-19 vaccine under operation warp speed. STANLEY ERCK, CEO, NOVAVAX: This whole issue is unprecedented, the speed, the scale that we have to get to, that's going to require a lot of more work and luck and success, but we're confident in our platform. (END VIDEOTAPE) SERRIE: And Bret today, the University of Washington's Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation expanded its forecast for COVID-19. It is now projecting more than 208,000 U.S. deaths by October 1st, that's up from its previous projection of 175,000, Bret. BAIER: We've seen some back and forth with that organization before, we will track that. Jonathan, as always, thank you. Breaking tonight, if you or more likely your children, enjoy using the TikTok app, you should be aware the U.S. government may ban it soon. There are increasing concerns over the social media outlet and its ties to the Chinese government and what's coming out of it. State department correspondent Rich Edson shows us. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) RICH EDSON, FOX NEWS CHANNEL STATE DEPARTMENT CORRESPONDENT: This is TikTok, a popular app where users can record, edit, and interact with short videos. 30 million Americans use it but the Trump administration is considering banning the Chinese-owned company in the United States over security concerns. MIKE POMPEO, SECRETARY OF STATE: We're taking this very seriously, we're certainly looking at it. EDSON: U.S. officials tell Fox News discussions around possibly banning TikTok are in the early stages. Saying the administration is prepared to counter any app that spies on Americans. Chinese tech firm ByteDance which owns TikTok is denying the claims. The company says it stores American user's data in servers within the United States with a backup in Singapore that none of that information is subject to Chinese law and quote, TikTok is led by an American CEO. We have never provided user data to the Chinese government, nor would we do so if asked. U.S. Officials say TikTok is among other Chinese-owned apps they're evaluating. For years, the administration has led an international campaign to convince countries to curtail or ban Chinese software and equipment, claiming they expose sensitive data to Chinese government. (END VIDEOTAPE) EDSON: FBI Director Christopher Wray says of the FBI's nearly 5,000 counterintelligence cases, nearly half are related to China and China is actively working to compromise American institutions and companies that are researching COVID-19, Bret. BAIER: Rich Edson at the state department. Rich, thank you. Let's talk about where things stand right now in the fight against the coronavirus and the challenges with China as well. \u00a0We're joined by the man in charge of the Coronavirus Task Force, Vice President Mike Pence. \u00a0Mr. Vice President, thanks for being here. \u00a0MIKE PENCE, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Thank you, Bret. \u00a0BAIER: Why is it so important to open up schools this fall? \u00a0PENCE: Well, we had a very important summit today, a good conference call with the nation's governor. \u00a0And President Trump has made it clear, as we open up America again, we need to open up America's schools. And from early on in this pandemic, the CDC has been giving guidance on how we can safely mitigate and operate schools. \u00a0New guidance was issued last week. But I must tell you that parents around America, teachers around America -- and we trust leaders all across this country -- are going to continue to work, continue to find ways to open our schools up again. \u00a0The good news is, 47 states have already issued plans and guidance for doing just that. And we are going to continue to work very closely with them. \u00a0We just think it is important to get America back to work, it is important to get our kids back to school, and all of that can be done as we continue to make sure that states that are seeing rising cases have the testing, the personal protective equipment, and have the medicines to be able to confront this pandemic, even as we open up America again. \u00a0BAIER: The president said today, Mr. Vice President, that he was going to pressure the governors to open, if they didn't. \u00a0I just want to ask you what that looks like. If the governors, as what happened with the lockdown, make their own individual decisions, based on what their state is doing or going through and what health experts are telling them, what does that pressure look like? How does it manifest? \u00a0PENCE: Well, I think, today, the president brought together teachers, healthcare leaders. We all reflected on what I believe is the overwhelming opinion of the American people, that we have got to get our kids back to school. \u00a0And so today was very much about the president doing like he is wont to do, is focusing on this important need. \u00a0But I must tell you, whether it be the American Association of Pediatrics that put out a statement last week about the importance of classroom learning, the -- what we are hearing from educators and parents around America, that we can't let our kids fall behind academically. \u00a0But, also, Bret, you know, you are a parent. You understand that it's far beyond academics, that millions of families rely on our local schools. \u00a0Many -- many of our children that struggle with emotional challenges or disabilities, they receive those services at school. Add into that nutrition. Add into that other ways that we serve our kids. \u00a0It's absolutely essential that we get back to school. And the president is going to continue to focus effort on that, but also work with our governors to see those plans implemented. \u00a0The one point that we made today with governors on our conference call, Bret, was, as the CDC has issued renewed guidance last week on how we can safely operate our schools, we wanted to make it clear, we don't want the federal government to be the reason why you don't reopen your local school. \u00a0BAIER: Yes. \u00a0PENCE: We want to work with local officials, school officials, governors in states around the country to find a way to safely reopen our schools. \u00a0BAIER: I think... \u00a0PENCE: And we believe that we can do that for most of the country. \u00a0BAIER: Mr. Vice President, I think there is unity that parents want their kids back to school. \u00a0PENCE: Yes. \u00a0BAIER: I do think that you hear that, no matter the ideology, the political ideology. \u00a0But do you believe, as the president said today, that Democrats want to keep schools closed for political reasons? You talk to these governors, Democrats and Republicans. \u00a0PENCE: Well, look, I -- let me leave the governors out of it for just a second to say they're -- when we hear some word about teachers unions beginning already to say that they're not going to be willing to come back in some jurisdictions around the country, look, we all ought to be working together on this. \u00a0I mean, as I said at the top, to open up America, we have got to open up America's schools. It's absolutely essential. \u00a0I didn't even mention the fact that the academic well-being, the health and well-being of our kids is of paramount importance. But let's remember working families. Let's remember single parents. \u00a0I mean, for people to be able to go back to work full-time this fall, we have got to have these schools up and running and working. \u00a0BAIER: Yes, I hear you. \u00a0PENCE: And so, what -- the president made it clear today, shot across the bow, anybody that wants to play politics on this thing is on fair notice that we're not going to put up with it. \u00a0And I really believe that the overwhelming majority of the American people, of families, of educators all know we can get back to school, we can get back to school safely, K-12, higher education. \u00a0And our White House Coronavirus Task Force is going to continue to work very closely with Republican and Democrat governors to get that done. \u00a0BAIER: Well, let's hope it happens. \u00a0Today, the administration just pulled out of the World Health Organization. \u00a0Not surprisingly, Joe Biden put out a tweet, saying he would join it, if he gets elected, on the first day. \u00a0But your fellow Republican Lamar Alexander, chairman of the Senate Health Committee, put out this statement moments ago, saying, \"I disagree with the president's decision. Certainly there needs to be a good, hard look at mistakes the World Health Organization might have made in connection with the coronavirus, but the time to do that is after the crisis has been dealt with, not in the middle of it. Withdrawing U.S. membership could, among other things, interfere with clinical trials that are essential to the development of vaccines, which citizens of the United States as well as others in the world need.' \u00a0Is now the right time to be doing this move? \u00a0PENCE: Well, it's absolutely the right time to notify Congress. \u00a0With all due respect to Senator Alexander's view, the World Health Organization let the world down, and by -- by not informing the United States and the wider world of this pandemic as it began in China, as giving ill-fated advice in January and February. It -- there have to be consequences to this. \u00a0But, look, I will be honest with you. I'm not surprised Joe Biden wants to -- wants to keep us roped into another international organization. I mean, Joe Biden actually condemned President Trump's actions when he suspended all travel from China at the end of January. \u00a0You know, the fact that the president did that, I can tell you firsthand, Bret, that bought our nation invaluable time to reinvent testing, to spin up hundreds of millions of personal protective equipment and supplies, to begin the process of pursuing medicines, therapeutics, and vaccines. \u00a0If -- if Joe Biden would've had his way, we literally would've had tens of millions of more Chinese coming into our country and spreading the pandemic and putting more and more Americans at risk. \u00a0BAIER: I want to talk to you (ph) -- \u00a0PENCE: So, right decision on the WHO. Joe Biden would've made the wrong decision in January. \u00a0BAIER: Apologize for the delay. \u00a0I want to talk to you about China in just a minute. \u00a0But just to wrap up the coronavirus -- \u00a0PENCE: Yes. \u00a0BAIER: And you lead this task force. Obviously, the numbers are going up. The president wants us to focus on death rate. And we do. And I will mention that in a minute. \u00a0The administration critics say the president constantly downplays the seriousness of COVID-19. And they say he speaks in optimism, not reality. \u00a0Take a listen to this. \u00a0(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) \u00a0TRUMP: We have tested almost 40 million people. By so doing, we show cases, 99 percent of which are totally harmless. \u00a0THOMAS BOSSERT, FORMER WHITE HOUSE HOMELAND SECURITY ADVISER: We have to start at the basics and level with people. Suggesting that it's not dangerous is, in itself, a dangerous message. \u00a0(END VIDEO CLIP) \u00a0BAIER: Mr. Vice President, Tom Bossert obviously served in the administration with you. \u00a0Health experts say it's just not the case that only 1 percent of cases, COVID cases, that they're dangerous. It's more than that. \u00a0So, is there a messaging problem here with the virus? \u00a0PENCE: Well, look, the American people know President Trump is an optimist. He believes in this country. \u00a0But he also believes the American people deserve to have the whole story. I mean, the reality is, because of what the president did in suspending all travel to China, we were able to stand up a national response that has saved hundreds of thousands, and perhaps even millions, of American lives. \u00a0We have rising cases right now along the South, Bret. I was in Texas and Arizona and Florida last week. And the good news is, is, as we told governors again today, we have the resources to support all the testing that they need. \u00a0We have new therapeutic medicines that -- like remdesivir, that have been distributed all across the country. And we have literally tens of millions of personal protective equipment supplies in reserves, even though I heard from the governors that I personally met with that the PPE effort by the national government has been so strong that the hospitals all across the Sunbelt that are seeing rising cases have more than enough PPE. \u00a0What they did request of us, and the president authorized, was us to send additional doctors and nurses. We are in the process of doing that in all four of the larger states that have been impacted so far. And we will do it in any other states that request it. \u00a0BAIER: Right. On the -- \u00a0PENCE: But what the president wants the American people to know is that our national response, whether it be testing, whether it be PPE, whether it be the supplies and the medicines, has saved American lives. \u00a0More than two months ago, Bret, we were losing 2,500 Americans a day, and there was a day just recently where we only lost 250 Americans. \u00a0BAIER: Right. \u00a0PENCE: That's a 90 percent reduction in fatalities. \u00a0BAIER: So -- \u00a0PENCE: It's a credit to the American people, to all the sacrifices they have made, to our healthcare workers. \u00a0But, ultimately, it's a credit to our national response, which has secured one of the lowest mortality rates in the world. \u00a0BAIER: Right. \u00a0Now, you talk about mortality. Dr. Fauci said today that it's a false narrative to take comfort in the lower rate of death, because there are so many things very dangerous about this disease. Don't get yourself into false complacency. \u00a0You are right about the mortality rates. But some experts are saying they drag behind, with the cases going up, that the death rates -- well, let's hope not, but they may follow. \u00a0Here -- Dr. Fauci also said that state and local governments should mandate mask-wearing, especially if there is an outbreak there. Do you agree with that recommendation? \u00a0PENCE: Well, we -- what we agree with is whatever state and local officials determine is appropriate for their area. \u00a0I mean, from the very beginning, President Trump has made it clear that we are going to support our governors, we are going to support local health officials in taking the steps that they deem are most appropriate. \u00a0But back to Dr. Fauci, who I have worked with very closely now for four months, you know, the -- I can assure you, there is no complacency in the administration. \u00a0And the president isn't referring to the lowest mortality rate in the world as a reason for complacency. He just -- he wants the American people to know that we have made progress combating this pandemic because of all the sacrifices they have made. \u00a0And we are going to continue to make sure that states across this country, particularly across the Sunbelt, have the resources and the supplies to do everything in their power, with those incredible healthcare workers in those hospitals, to keep those losses low, again, the lowest in the world by several measures. \u00a0It's a credit to the American people. And we are not going to relent in our effort to make sure that our states have the testing resources to identify people -- \u00a0BAIER: Yes. \u00a0PENCE: -- have the PPE to render healthcare, have the extraordinary medicines like remdesivir, like the steroid treatment, like convalescent plasma, that are really bringing real relief and restoring health to Americans. \u00a0It's -- \u00a0BAIER: Mr. Vice President -- \u00a0PENCE: We just -- we owe it to the American people to give them the whole story. \u00a0And while you see cases rising -- and, frankly, some in the media want to focus exclusively on rising cases -- the American people deserve to understand that we are making progress in this pandemic. It's because of all that they have done. \u00a0And we are going to make sure every state and every community that has rising cases and rising positivity rates has everything they need to meet the moment. \u00a0BAIER: Mr. Vice President, I wanted to give you time to talk about that. \u00a0There -- your shot just dropped out for a second. \u00a0If you wouldn't mind, I do want to ask you about China. \u00a0PENCE: Sure. \u00a0BAIER: Do you have a second on the other side of this break? \u00a0PENCE: You bet. \u00a0BAIER: OK. \u00a0We will be back with the vice president of the United States after this. \u00a0(COMMERCIAL BREAK) \u00a0BAIER: Again, joined by the vice president of the United States. \u00a0Mr. Vice President, thank you for sticking around. \u00a0PENCE: You bet. \u00a0BAIER: On China, Secretary of State Pompeo said you all are considering the banning of this Chinese-owned app TikTok. \u00a0The FBI director spoke out very aggressively with me, and then gave a speech this week about China. \u00a0You have spoken out a couple of times aggressively about China. \u00a0PENCE: Yes. \u00a0BAIER: Is China our enemy? \u00a0PENCE: Well, there's no question China is a strategic competitor with -- \u00a0BAIER: Lost the feed there from the vice president. \u00a0Let's see if we reestablish this connection. Don't think we have him up. \u00a0Mr. Vice President, can you hear me? \u00a0OK, we will try to reestablish that connection. Oh, here we go. \u00a0Sorry for the interruption, Mr. Vice President. \u00a0You were saying on China? \u00a0PENCE: Well, no one's been tougher on China than President Donald Trump, Bret. \u00a0I mean from very early on, this president stood strong to reset an imbalanced trading relationship that previous administrations allowed to develop in a way that, when we took office, half of our international trade deficit was with China. \u00a0The president stood strong. He also made it clear that we are going to defend our strategic interests in the region. Two aircraft carriers in the South China Sea as we speak is evidence of our commitment to continue to remain an Asian-Pacific power and preserve freedom of navigation. \u00a0But I must tell you that, whether it be the stand on Huawei, or what we're currently considering with TikTok, this president also made it clear that we are going to preserve the national security interests of the United States of America from being compromised by the Chinese Communist Party. \u00a0And so, these entities, whether it be Huawei and perhaps even TikTok, that represents a threat to the privacy and to the security of the country, we will continue to take a strong stand. \u00a0BAIER: I want to end with this, turning to topics that the president brought up this week. \u00a0Did NASCAR make the right move banning the confederate flag? \u00a0PENCE: Well, let me say that we respect the right of private organizations to make the decisions that they deem appropriate for their organization and for their fan base. \u00a0But, at the end of the day, the president -- as he said again today, he believes in freedom of speech -- will always stand for that for every American. \u00a0But I must tell you that being a part of an administration that saw the lowest unemployment rate ever recorded for African-Americans, that we heard again today at our education summit has made historic investments in Historically Black Colleges and Universities, working to open up those schools and all of our schools around America as we speak, expanding Opportunity Zones, I think people, whether it be African-Americans or any American, looks at the record of this administration, and knows that this is a president who is committed to being president for all of the American people and to seeing all of the American people live the American dream. \u00a0BAIER: Yes. \u00a0I guess the state of Mississippi removed the confederate symbol from its flag. And Republicans in that state said, like Roger Wicker, it was the right thing to do. It's a symbol that more and more represents a day in the past that we don't want to celebrate. \u00a0And some of those Republicans thought there was a disconnect, at least, in what was tweeted out by the president. You're saying there's not? \u00a0PENCE: Well, there's not. \u00a0And we fully respect the decision made by the people of Mississippi going forward. \u00a0And quite apart from the whole issue of the confederate flag, I just think it's the question of -- as the president said at Mount Rushmore, we are going to defend the great and long story (ph) history of this country. \u00a0We have been on a relentless journey toward a more perfect union. We went through a terrible Civil War; 600,000 Americans died on both sides to end slavery. We saw the advance in my lifetime of the civil rights movement, at great cost. \u00a0And we are going to continue to celebrate all of the ideals of this country, the contributions of every American, of every race and creed and background. \u00a0And this president, in a very real sense, I promise you, is going to continue to defend America and defend America's great traditions against those who want to tear down statues, who want to erase our history. \u00a0We believe that we can learn from our history, we can move forward together, and that's how we are going to have a more united United States of America. BAIER: Mr. Vice President, we really appreciate your time, your extra time, thank you for sticking around, and we'll see you down the road. PENCE: Thank you, Bret. BAIER: Up next, we'll have the other day's news. Stay here on SPECIAL REPORT. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BAIER: Breaking just before the show tonight, the top U.S. general in the Middle East says he was aware of intelligence about a Russian bounty program targeting American troops in Afghanistan, but CENTCOM commander General Kenneth McKenzie says that while he found it worrisome, he did not believe it was tied to actual death on the battlefield and saw nothing of that. We'll continue to follow that story. In tonight's Democracy 2020 report, even in these uncertain time, Joe Biden can count on at least one primary election vote tonight, his own. The presumptive Democratic nominee participated in the election in Delaware. It comes as we learn new details of how President Trump is trying to frame his challenger and whether that's working. Here is correspondent Peter Doocy. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PETER DOOCY, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: President Trump is trying to peg Joe Biden as a figurehead surrounded by radical leftists. DONALD TRUMP, (R) PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Sleepy Joe, and he wouldn't call the shots. He would have nothing to do with it. Lock him in the Oval Office, let's just do what we want to do. DOOCY: But in a new memo, the Biden campaign argues lines like that aren't landing. Quote, \"The reality, while Donald Trump is desperately trying to paint Biden is out of the mainstream, Trump's record of shoveling taxpayer money to big corporations, cutting taxes for the wealthy, and suing to take away protections for people with preexisting conditions couldn't be any further from the values of ordinary Americans.\" Now part of the team that helped Barack Obama get elected twice argues this president's approach could hurt all Republicans up in November. JIM MESSINA, OBAMA 2012 CAMPAIGN MANAGER: What President Trump needs to do is become president and pull the country together, and instead he's spending his whole time attacking everyone but himself, and it's doing real damage. DOOCY: President Trump's former chief of staff agrees. MICK MULVANEY, INCOMING ACTING WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF: I think he's got some real headwinds to face. DOOCY: But he has some ideas about how President Trump can turn things around. MULVANEY: The president can go back to drawing those contrasts between him and Joe Biden. If it becomes a race between Trump and Biden, I think the president does extraordinarily well. DOOCY: The DNC is now working closer with the Biden campaign than they ever did with the Clinton campaign, as Democrats cross their fingers their side doesn't get overconfident. MESSINA: We are the party that screwed up 2016 and lost to Donald Trump in the first place. (END VIDEOTAPE) DOOCY: Joe Biden just did his part to help Joe Biden to be Trump, and it has nothing to do with a speech or a policy paper. He voted by mail in his home state's primary. So he did as much as any Delaware resident can. Bret? BAIER: Peter, thank you. Be sure to check out my podcast \"The Campaign.\" It comes out every Tuesday, 5:00 p.m. Peter is on there. You can download it at = or wherever you download podcasts. It's a great panel discussion, update on the state of the race right now week to week. Stock were off today. The Dow lost 397, the S&P 500 fell 34, the Nasdaq finished down 90. Up next, President Trump's niece spills some of what she says are family secrets. We have the book and a report. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BAIER: We're getting our first look at some of the explosive claim in a new book by President Trump's niece. We have the book. Correspondent David Spunt has the details. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KAYLEIGH MCENANY, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: It's a book of falsehoods. DAVID SPUNT, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: That book is \"Too Much and Never Enough, How My Family Created the World's Most Dangerous Man,\" 200 pages that tell a story of dysfunction and the rise to power. Mary Trump spills alleged family secrets and private conversations. Without providing proof, she claims that more than 50 years ago, her uncle, who she calls \"Donald\" throughout the book, paid a friend to take his SAT test help him get accepted at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, writing \"That was much easier to pull off in the days before photo IDs and computerized records. Donald, who never lacks for funds, paid his buddy well.\" It's an accusation the White House denies. Mary Trump is the daughter of the president's late brother Fred. She recounts the stress from her father's death in 1981 following a battle with alcoholism. DONALD TRUMP, (R) PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Great guy, best looking guy, best personality, much better than mine. (LAUGHTER) TRUMP: But he had a problem. SPUNT: Mary Trump recalls an alleged conversation with her aunt, retired federal judge Maryanne Trump Barry, in 2015. According to Mary, her onset \"He's using your father's memory for political purposes,\" Maryanne said, \"and that's a sin, especially since Freddy should have been the star of the family.\" She claims the president's sister doubted his election prospects and called him a clown. DONALD TRUMP, (R) PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I, Donald John Trump, do solemnly swear. SPUNT: Mary has seldom been in touch with the president, admitting she was estranged from his immediate family for years, cut out of her grandmother's will and unwelcome at her funeral. The book comes just weeks after former National Security Advisor John Bolton released his tell-all of his time in the White House and two months before a book about the First Lady from former aide Stephanie Winston Wolkoff is set to hit shelves. KELLYANNE CONWAY, COUNSELOR TO PRESIDENT TRUMP: We imbue instant credibility onto anybody, especially those not under oath and writing works of fiction, perhaps, or a fiction within a work of fiction, as long as they are out there to get the president. (END VIDEOTAPE) SPUNT: This is the book, Bret. President Trump's younger brother Robert fought in court to block the book's release, arguing that Mary signed a confidentiality agreement. After bouncing back and forth to several judges, the book is scheduled for release one week from today. No comment tonight from the president's sister, Judge Trump Barry, about the book. Bret? BAIER: OK, David, thank you. There are a lot of questions tonight concerning what we know and what we don't know about the coronavirus. Correspondent Doug McKelway looks at some of them this evening. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DOUG MCKELWAY, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Two months after his first appearance on Florida beaches, the ominously dressed lawyer Daniel Uhlfelder came back to the beach as the Grim Reaper, as if to prove his earlier warnings about COVID-19 research. But 120 days in, there's still much unknown. The president tweeted yesterday \"Cases up because of massive testing, deaths are down, low and steady.\" The tweet is largely true. DR. MARC SIEGEL, NYU LANGONE MEDICAL CENTER: Case numbers have doubled over the past few weeks, but I'm seeing a decreasing in trends yesterday, 47 deaths. Deaths are extremely low. MCKELWAY: Nationwide, positive cases are at 44,953 in the last week, but deaths are up only 325. That's a distinction not made in some reporting, and many experts still maintain some states reopened too soon. DR. TOM FRIEDEN, FORMER CDC DIRECTOR: If you open when cases are still increasing, as many states did, it's like leaning into a left hook. You're going to get hit hard, and that's what's happening. MCKELWAY: The south and west is where heat and ultraviolet sunlight were expected to slow the spread. One suggestion is that stifling summer heat is driving people to the air-conditioned indoors, where the virus may thrive. The Cleveland Clinic notes that air-conditioning moves air around in a room, but sys there's is no clear evidence it spreads the virus. Another unknown -- is it possible to be re-infected with COVID-19? The CDC finds, quote, \"The immune response, including duration of immunity, is not yet understood.\" (END VIDEOTAPE) MCKELWAY: Another question -- do masks really help? Early on in the pandemic, Surgeon General Adams cautioned against using them, but now that the disease has determined to be transmissible, he says they can make all the difference. Bret? BAIER: Dr. Fauci and Dr. Birx do, too. Doug, thank you. Up next, the panel on the coronavirus, schools, testing, and my interview with Vice President Pence. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES: \u00a0We are still knee-deep in the first wave of this. The current state is really not good. DR. DEBORAH BIRX, WHITE HOUSE CORONAVIRUS RESPONSE COORDINATOR: In the rush to just close things down, there was not -- everything was not completely considered in that moment about how we were going to protect our children. DONALD TRUMP, (R) PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We want to get our schools open. We want to get them open quickly, beautifully in the fall. MIKE PENCE, U.S. VICE PRESIDENT: It's far beyond academics that millions of families rely on our local schools. Many of our children that struggle with emotional challenges or disabilities, they receive those services at school. (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: Opening up the schools a priority, Vice President Pence talking about it on the show earlier. Let's bring in our panel, Charles Hurt, opinion editor for \"The Washington Times,\" Mara Liasson, national political correspondent for National Public Radio, and Jonah Goldberg, editor in chief of \"The Dispatch.\" Mara, it's obviously a priority. The president is saying he's going to pressure governors if they don't do it. But as we saw in the lockdown, eventually governors make the call in those states and localities. MARA LIASSON, NATIONAL POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, NATIONAL PUBLIC RADIO: \u00a0Yes. And look, every parent wants their kids to go back to school. Speaking for myself, that's true. But the big question is will reopening the schools take the same path as reopening other parts of the economy, where after you did that in certain states you had spikes. Sometimes classrooms can be petri dishes, and even if kids are not affected by the virus as much, teachers can be. So it's really important to get it right, and I know schools all over the country including my own kids schools are struggling with how to do it, how many kids should go back in the classroom at once, what kind of distancing do you impose. So this is a tricky problem. BAIER: And Jonah, there is obviously a disparity across the country with the ability of do some kind of hybrid or distance-learning where they come in, and if there's an issue then they go onto the computer. Not everybody has the same connectivity. JONAH GOLDBERG, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: It's not even just a state by state or jurisdiction by jurisdiction, it's also a level of school by level of school thing. Little kids are going to have different requirements than high school kids. Some states in warmer climates could figure out ways to do classes outside. You can't really ask Minnesota students to do a lot of classes outside in the fall and winter. So there's so much variation here. And I think it's very smart of the administration to talk about how much they want the schools to open because everybody agrees with that, but the devil is in the details, and it's a very strange disconnect to say that masks should be a state by state local issue, but schools should uniformly open all across the country. I think that's a real logistical hurdle for them. BAIER: Right, the two mandates there. Charlie? CHARLES HURT, OPINION EDITOR, \"WASHINGTON TIMES\": I actually think that its' -- I agree with Jonah that it's very wise for the administration to be talking about the importance of opening up schools. But I'd say going into the election, we have a very clear difference between that candidates, between President Trump and Vice President Joe Biden. Voters will have a real opportunity to pick between the two strategies. And I have to say that I do think the notion that you are pressuring localities to make those decisions at a local level is probably a very wise one. But meanwhile, pressuring people to open up is also a very important step in all of that. But at the end of the day we will have a referendum on this. BAIER: Mara, I want to turn to China. You have the FBI director, the secretary of state, now the vice president very aggressively talking about it, seems like it is coming to a head with some more executive actions about China. The trade deal, is it up in the air or not? We didn't really get there. But it seems like it also is going with campaign to pin China on Joe Biden. LIASSON: Yes, this is really tricky because the president wants the trade deal, but he also wants to be as tough on China as possible, because the argument that he's been pushing is that Joe Biden was too soft on China. China is one of the biggest contrasts he's trying to make, and I think the Biden campaign is trying as hard as they can to not make it easy for the Trump campaign to do that, returning fire, saying John Bolton's book, other evidence that we have that President Trump has been too easy on China. And I think you're just going to see this unfold, whether it's TikTok, Huawei, all sorts of other front lines. But China and that U.S. are decoupling, and its big flash point in the campaign. BAIER: And it's a big flash point in the world, Jonah. GOLDBERG: No, it is. I think it's baked into the cake that we're going to be entering an era of hawkishness towards China. The only question is going to be whether it's going to be dumb hawkishness and smart hawkishness, because we definitely need to push back on China. China needs to get that message. We need allies in the region, and I fear that this campaign, we're not going to get a lot of smart hawkery, and we're going to get a lot of pandering from both campaigns. BAIER: Oh, come on, it's a campaign. (LAUGHTER) BAIER: We'll see. GOLDBERG: I know you're shocked. BAIER: Yes, shocked, shocked. Thank you all, panel. When we come back, the brighter side of things, some good news. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BAIER: Finally tonight, as promised, the brighter side, helping each other out. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) (MUSIC) (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: Twice a week at 6:00 p.m., Damaris Silva serenades sick patients and staff at a Chilean hospital with her violin. She walks the halls for several hours playing the mix of popular Latin songs, very welcome. From Chile to Alabama. When a customer at a restaurant in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, noticed an employee walking to work, the generous stranger decided to help out. The restaurant film to the employee being led to his new car as colleagues shared in the surprise from the anonymous donor. Now that is something you don't see every day.

We're an idea. It's not based on an ethnicity\u00a0or race.

He's blaming everything on China. He's blaming everything on the Chinese... and people don't make a distinction, as you well know, from a South Korean and someone from Beijing,\" Biden continued. \"They make no distinction, it's Asian. And he's using it as a wedge.\"Biden also accused Trump of being the \"first\" racist to be elected president.\u201cNo sitting president has ever done this. Never, never, never. No Republican president has done this. No Democratic president. We\u2019ve had racists and they\u2019ve existed and they\u2019ve tried to get elected president.

Its mass detention of Uyghurs, its godless decisions to replace church displays of the Ten Commandments with words from General Secretary Xi have not gone without being called out.\"Despite the recent tough talk, the administration has seemed to take a hodgepodge of stances on criticizing China, oftentimes depending on the issue. Trump has railed against China for taking advantage of the United States on trade deals since the 2016 campaign. But\u00a0he's often praised Chinese President Xi Jinping himself.Meanwhile, the U.S. has maintained a consistent message against China's claims in the South China Sea during the Trump administration, regularly executing freedom of navigation operations with U.S. Navy vessels. But Trump himself roiled Republicans last fall when he congratulated Xi on his country's 70th anniversary, refraining from any criticism of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).The Trump administration has sought to stymie the Chinese-controlled tech company Huawei from global 5G networks \u2014\u00a0something it just secured a major victory\u00a0at with the United Kingdom recently deciding to freeze Huawei out of its 5G infrastructure. But Trump, according to a memoir by his former National Security Adviser John Bolton, had indicated he personally didn't care about China's repression of ethnic minorities, specifically the Uyghur Muslims.\"At the opening dinner of the Osaka G20 meeting, with only interpreters present, Xi explained to Trump why he was basically building concentration camps in Xinjiang. According to our interpreter, Trump had said that Xi should go ahead with building the camps, which he thought was exactly the right thing to do,\" Bolton said. \"[Deputy National Security Advisor Matt] Pottinger told me Trump said something very similar during the 2017 trip to China, which meant we could cross repression of Uighurs off our list of possible reasons to sanction China, at least as long as trade negotiations continued.\"Trump and those in his administration have repeatedly condemned Bolton and his book, denying many of the allegations it contains.Now, amid the continuing fallout from the president's handling of the coronavirus pandemic, with Trump angrily deflecting blame for the virus toward China -- where it originated -- Pompeo and the State Department are putting rhetorical pressure on China with\u00a0renewed vigor.\"Countries that want to be global powers, countries that want to participate on the global stage, have a corresponding obligation to comply to the promises they make. China made a promise to the World Health Organization. There's a set of rules about disclosure, and when you have\u00a0 an incident in your country that could potentially lead to a pandemic, you have an obligation to report that and allow others co tome in and helo,\" Pompeo said in a video tweeted last week that was originally on The Hill's \"Virtually Live.\"The United States has withdrawn from the World Health Organization over its alleged compliance with China in covering up the coronavirus in its initial stages.Pompeo added: \"The Chinese Communist Party chose differently, they co-opted the World Health Organization to achieve that coverup, and the result today is that we have hundreds of thousands of people who have died and trillions of dollars in global damage as a direct result.\"Trump got at a similar point in an interview with \"Fox News Sunday.\"\"It came from China. They should've never let it escape. They should've never let it out,\" he said.Trump later continued: \"The World Health got a tremendous amount wrong. They basically did whatever China wanted them to. And we'll save now almost $500 million a year, which is nice. But the World Health got a lot wrong.\"China, meanwhile, has shot back in the diplomatic war of words, accusing the United States of mishandling the coronavirus and even at one point falsely accusing the U.S. Army of introducing the virus into China.\"The #US politicizes #COVID19 response at home and uses 'attacking China'\u00a0as a panacea for domestic problems. A real-life #HouseofCards\u00a0is on in #Washington, with people's lives at stake,\" Hua Chunying, a  for the country's foreign ministry, said in a tweet last week.It's unclear where U.S.-China relations could go from this increasingly hostile juncture, with another grand trade deal, cooperation on North Korea or reconciliation on geopolitical claims in East Asia looking increasingly unlikely. But any kind of military conflict still appears far-fetched, and\u00a0neither nation appears poised to institute new tariffs on the other -- private businesses in both countries continue to work in the other, with American businesses like the NBA still reluctant to even  China's human rights abuses, let alone take any action or make any statements on the matter.For now, tit-for-tat sanctions appear to be as far as either country will go, with Trump this month signing the Hong Kong Autonomy Act, a bill to sanctions Chinese entities that have contributed to eroding the freedoms once enjoyed in Hong Kong and financial institutions that do business with them. The\u00a0executive branch also announced sanctions in relation to the oppression of the Uyghur Muslims.Meanwhile, China\u00a0sanctioned some U.S. individuals, including Republican Sens. Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio. Cruz, a close ally of the administration, echoed the rhetoric from Pompeo in his response.\"Unfortunately for CCP leaders, I don't have plans to travel to the authoritarian regime that covered up the coronavirus pandemic and endangered millions of lives worldwide,\" Cruz said in a statement that also condemned\u00a0the \"horrific forced abortions and sterilizations\" of the Uyghur Muslims.", "comment": "", "topic": "State Department", "date": " July 20"}, {"cover": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/07/156/88/e516ab37-AP20188806866560.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "title": "Spencer Cox wins Republican primary in Utah governor's race", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/politics/spencer-cox-wins-republican-primary-in-utah-governors-race", "subtitle": "Cox captured a narrow lead with 36.4 percent of the vote over Huntsman\u2019s 34.6 percent, The Associated Press reports", "keyword": "U.S.-China trade and COVID-19", "website": "Fox News", "author": "Morgan Phillips", "content": "Utah Lt.

That\u2019s because little of consequence gets done on Capitol Hill until the 11th hour. And after months of a time vacuum amid coronavirus, the clock is ticking again on Capitol Hill. It\u2019s the 11th hour, as lawmakers struggle to finalize the next round of pandemic legislation. \u2018This won\u2019t get done until the 11th hour,\u2019 said one senior administration source to Fox about the bill recently. Sure about that? \u2026 The true deadline is the end of the week. Extra unemployment benefits Congress approved for workers to cope with the pandemic expire on Friday night.

Michigan began the year with expectations that it would be one of the most intense battlegrounds in the country, but its share of Trump television advertising dollars dwindled this summer as\u00a0built a steady advantage in the polls. Since the end of June, Mr. Trump has spent more money on ads in 10 other states \u2014 with Michigan falling behind even much smaller states like Iowa and Nevada \u2014 and in recent days, Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign stopped buying ads in Michigan entirely. The Biden campaign has more than tripled what Mr. Trump spent on television in Michigan in the last month, by far the most lopsided advantage of any swing state where both are advertising.\u201d\u00a0: \u201cPresident Donald Trump is headed to Odessa and Midland today for his 16th visit to Texas during his presidency. Trump is set to land in Midland at 11:30 a.m. before going to Odessa for a fundraising event at the Marriott. The president will later tour an oil rig at Double Eagle Energy in Midland and talk about his energy policies. The president's visit just a couple months before early voting begins highlights how Texas might see a closer presidential race than it has in decades. Three public polls show Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden in a dead heat, the Houston Chronicle reports. Before this, Texas was a reliable source of votes for Republicans.\u2026 Biden criticized Trump's visit as the state reels from the coronavirus and Hurricane Hanna, the Houston Chronicle reports. \u2018Mr. Trump, now isn\u2019t the time for politicking or photo-ops,\u2019 Biden said Wednesday morning.\u201d:\u00a0\u201cDonald Trump and Joe Biden are engaged in a tight race for Georgia\u2019s electoral votes according to the Monmouth University Poll. \u2026 Among all registered voters in Georgia, Trump is supported by 47% and Biden is supported by 47%, with 3% saying they will vote for Libertarian\u00a0\u00a0and 3% who are undecided. These results include 42% who are certain to vote for Trump and 39% who say the same for Biden. At the other end of the spectrum, 45% say they are not at all likely to vote for the incumbent and 44% say the same for challenger. \u2026\u00a0Overall, 46% of Georgia voters have a favorable opinion of Trump and 45% have an unfavorable one \u2013 including 38% very unfavorable. Biden gets a 41% favorable and 46% unfavorable rating, including 34% very unfavorable.\u201d: \u201cFormer Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee, was captured Tuesday holding a note with Sen.\u00a0' name printed across the top with talking points, including, \u2018Do not hold grudges.\u2019 The other talking points about Harris were: \u2018Campaigned with me & Jill.\u2019 \u2018Talented.\u2019 \u2018Great help to campaign.\u2019 \u2018Great respect for her.\u2019 Harris, D-Calif., was a Biden rival when she was running her own campaign for president but has since emerged as a top contender for the vice presidency. The does \u2018not hold grudges\u2019 talking point may be reference to the clash between the two at the first Democratic debate, when the former California attorney general went after Biden, who was considered the front-runner for most of 2019, on his civil rights record. \u2026 According to POLITICO, former Sen.\u00a0, who is a member of Biden\u2019s vice presidential search committee, was stunned by Harris' attack, reportedly saying, \u2018She laughed and said, \u2018that\u2019s politics.\u2019 She had no remorse.\u2019 Those comments have drawn criticism, especially from Democratic women, who say Harris is being held to a standard that wouldn\u2019t apply to a man.\u201d\u00a0: \u201cJoe Biden said Tuesday he would have his choice for a vice presidential running mate the first week of August. \u2018I\u2019m going to have a choice the first week in August and I promise I\u2019ll let you know when I do,\u2019 the Democratic presidential nominee told reporters after delivering a speech about the racial-equity part of his economic plan. Biden had previously pushed back his deadline for a decision from Aug. 1 to a bit later in the month. The Democratic National Convention starts on Aug. 17 and he is almost certain to announce his choice before that. The former vice president has pledged to choose a woman running mate. Last week he said that the group of candidates he was still considering included four Black women, among others.\u201d\u00a0: \u201c[A Monmouth University poll] showed close races in Georgia\u2019s two U.S. Senate contests. Republican U.S. Sen.\u00a0\u00a0held a 49-43 lead over Democrat\u00a0. \u2026 In Georgia\u2019s other U.S. Senate race, the free-for-all special election for U.S. Sen.\u00a0\u2019s seat, showed the Republican incumbent with a narrow advantage. Loeffler led the pack with 26% of support, followed by fellow Republican U.S. Rep.\u00a0\u00a0at 20%.\u00a0\u00a0was the top Democrat with 14% of the vote, trailed by\u00a0\u00a0at 9% and\u00a0\u00a0at 5%. \u2026 Another 18% of voters are undecided. That contest will feature 21 candidates all on the same ballot with no primary to filter out nominees. If no candidate gets a majority of the vote \u2013 a highly likely scenario \u2013 the two top finishers head to a January runoff.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0: \u201cA slew of dismal summer polls and a persistent fundraising gap have left some Republicans fretting about a nightmare scenario in November: That they will fall further into the House minority. Publicly, House GOP leaders are declaring they can still net the 17 seats needed to flip the chamber. But privately, some party strategists concede it\u2019s a much grimmer picture, with as many as 20 Republican seats at risk of falling into Democratic hands. Far from going on offense, the GOP could be forced to retrench in order to limit its losses. There's a growing fear that President Donald Trump\u2019s plummeting popularity in the suburbs could threaten GOP candidates in traditionally favorable districts, and that their party's eagerness to go on offense might leave some underfunded incumbents and open GOP-held seats unprotected. Internal Democratic surveys in recent weeks have shown tight races in once-solid GOP seats in Indiana, Texas, Michigan, Ohio and Montana that Trump carried handily 2016 \u2014 data that suggest the battleground is veering in a dangerous direction for the GOP.\u201d: \u201cTwo years ago, the notion of running a progressive\u00a0\u00a0supporter in a Trump district in Texas would have been seen as political suicide. Now,\u00a0, a school-board member who talks about her path from homelessness to the pinnacle of local politics, is considered one of the Democrats\u2019 top House recruits in the country. In the primary, she defeated a retired Air Force colonel, the type of candidate who would typically be seen as better-positioned to win over moderate swing voters. Meanwhile, the biggest-name Democratic congressional hopeful in Texas is former gubernatorial candidate\u00a0. Davis, whose abortion-rights activism backfired in the conservative-minded red state during her 2014 race, is suddenly looking like a viable candidate in the reliably Republican 21st District, which is even more Trump-friendly than the state at large.\u201d\u00a0:\u201cSo much for Southern hospitality. This fall, Tennessee will say goodbye to retiring Sen.\u00a0, one of the last of the genteel Republican moderates in the chamber. And the race to replace him has turned into perhaps the ugliest Republican primary in the country \u2014 with spurious super PAC attacks,\u00a0\u00a0being invoked as a slur and President Donald Trump lining up on opposite sides as Sen.\u00a0. The race was never supposed to be competitive: The Trump-backed candidate,\u00a0\u00a0\u2014 who served as the president\u2019s ambassador to Japan \u2014 was on a glide path. Trump endorsed Hagerty before he even left Tokyo or entered the race. But as the contest has tightened in the run-up to the Aug. 6 election, Hagerty's main opponent,\u00a0, has found traction by claiming to be the true, unapologetic Trumpian conservative in the race \u2014 while blasting Hagerty as a squishy, Mitt Romney-loving phony.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0: \u201cDemocrats on Tuesday notched two victories in lawsuits aimed at making it easier to vote by mail during the pandemic. The state of Rhode Island agreed to eliminate witness or notary requirements for people voting by mail throughout the 2020 elections due to the Covid-19 pandemic. A judge signed off on the agreement Tuesday. The case was brought on behalf of two voting rights advocacy groups -- the League of Women Voters of Rhode Island and Common Cause Rhode Island\u2026 Also on Tuesday, a judge in Minnesota blocked election officials from enforcing a state law that prohibited voters from helping more than three other people to cast absentee ballots, handing a significant win to two national Democratic organizations that sued to end the provisions.\u201d: \u201cThe Lincoln Project, a group founded by \"never Trump\" Republicans that has produced some of the cycle's most memorable ads, today begins spending $4 million to blitz Senate races in Alaska, Maine and Montana. This is the Lincoln Project's biggest buy to date, and the Senate ads will air for seven to 10 days in key markets. The ads \u2014 which include \u2018Real\u2019 in Alaska and \u2018Strong\u2019 in Montana \u2014 support challengers to incumbent Republicans. \u2018Trump Stooge,\u2019 airing in Maine, criticizes Sen. Susan Collins for not standing up to President Trump. \u2018Maine deserves a leader, not a Trump stooge,\u2019 the ad says. \u2018We\u2019re moving into the active phase of the fall campaign as voters, stuck at home because of COVID-19, tune in earlier than ever,\u2019 communications director\u00a0\u00a0told Axios.\u201d: \u201c[The] tactical case for conducting a Sherman\u2019s march through the GOP is weak. The problem is not just that very few voters cast their ballots for tactical reasons. It\u2019s that it\u2019s not at all clear that the Republican Party can be burned down or Trumpism extinguished. Let\u2019s say that the November elections lead to Republicans losing the White House, 20 House seats, 12 Senate seats and five governorships: a result considerably worse for the Republicans than most observers expect. That would leave them with roughly the same amount of power they had in 2009, after\u00a0\u2019s disastrous second term. Eight years later, they had a majority of everything. Or think back to the aftermath of Watergate. Four years after\u00a0left office, they had the White House again and their first Senate majority in decades. Parties can bounce back quickly, even after defeats that look epochal.\u201d\u00a0: \u201cFederal officers will start pulling out of Portland on Thursday in a phased withdrawal and state troopers will arrive instead to help safeguard the federal courthouse downtown that has become a national symbol of political conflict as well as a focal point for protests calling for consequential police reform. Gov.\u00a0\u00a0made the announcement in a statement Wednesday and described the federal officers \u2018an occupying force\u2019 that has \u2018refused accountability and brought strife to our community.\u2019 Acting Homeland Security Secretary\u00a0, in a separate announcement, said he had been in talks with the governor in the last day and agreed to a \u2018joint plan to end the violent activity in Portland directed at federal properties and law enforcement.\u2019 But he tempered the statement by saying the \u2018augmented\u2019 federal force would remain in Portland \u2018until the violent activity toward our facility ends. We are not removing any law enforcement while our facilities and law enforcement remain under attack.\u2019\u201d: \u201cTuesday marked the 62nd consecutive night demonstrations continued in downtown Portland in the wake of George Floyd\u2019s death in police custody in Minneapolis. Portland police officers clashed with demonstrators before federal agents arrived to protect the\u00a0\u00a0U.S. Courthouse, Multnomah County Justice Center, and other government buildings the July 4 weekend. Crowds -- ranging from hundreds to thousands of people -- have tried almost every night to tear down a fence erected to protect the courthouse. They\u2019ve set fires and hurled fireworks, Molotov cocktails, and bricks, rocks, and bottles at the agents inside. Authorities this week reinforced the fence by putting concrete highway barriers around it. Federal officers often respond by firing tear gas, pepper balls, and impact munitions.\u201d\u00a0: \u201cThe Pentagon is proceeding with President Donald Trump's plan to move 12,000 U.S. troops out of Germany \u2013 about 6,400 forces will be brought home and 5,400 shifted to other countries in Europe, U.S. defense officials said Wednesday. The move will cost billions of dollars and take years to complete. It has attracted bipartisan congressional opposition, raised concerns among NATO allies and appears to be fueled at least in part by Trump\u2019s displeasure at Germany's failure to spend more on defense. The Pentagon said the action was part of its plan to strategically \u2018reposition\u2019 U.S. forces in Europe to better counter threats from Russia and China. \u2026 \u2018They take advantage of us on trade, and they take advantage of us on the military,\u2019 Trump said of Germany on Wednesday, speaking to White House reporters. \u2018So we're reducing the force because they\u2019re not paying their bills. It's very simple. They\u2019re delinquent,\u2019 Trump added, before heading to Texas for a campaign event.\u201d\u00a0: \u201cPresident Trump has never confronted\u00a0\u00a0with intelligence indicating Russia paid the Taliban to kill U.S. troops, he told \u2018Axios on HBO\u2019 in an interview on Tuesday. Why it matters: Democrats have seized on the issue, and Trump's reluctance to discuss it, as evidence he\u2019s unwilling to challenge Putin even when American lives are at stake. Trump spoke with Putin on Thursday, and subsequently deflected a question about whether he\u2019d raised the alleged bounty scheme, saying on Monday: \u2018We don't talk about what we discussed, but we had plenty of discussion.\u2019 In Tuesday\u2019s interview, he was definitive: \u2018I have never discussed it with him.\u2019 Pressed on why he didn\u2019t raise the matter in Thursday\u2019s call, he said: \u2018That was a phone call to discuss other things, and frankly that\u2019s an issue that many people said was fake news.\u2019\u201d\u00a0\u00a0-\u00a0\u00a0-\u00a0\u00a0-\u00a0\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s like a giraffe and a flamingo. They\u2019re both at a zoo. A dumb person may think they could mate for offspring. A smart person knows that\u2019s impossible. That\u2019s our bills. They\u2019re unable to mate.\u201d \u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI am currently a graduate student studying math and engineering so, I admit, my grasp on the finer details of history is not as good as I would like it to be. I often hear it stated that Jefferson and Hamilton created the ideological divide in American politics with their differing philosophies. The implication being, that Jefferson is the father of the democrats and Hamilton the father of republicanism. \u2026 Any thoughts on the shifting sentiments in the established parties or could you recommend and books that can explain this in more detail? Final question, do find it conceivable that the Republican Party can ever adopt a form of Thatcher-ism or is it more likely that we will be plagued by populism for the foreseeable future?\u201d \u2013\u00a0\u00a0[]\u00a0\u201cWhat\u2019s your take on what would happen if Trump is defeated and a new Democrat majority is elected to the Senate, but between election day and January 20th there is a vacancy among the liberal side of the Supreme Court.

And the last few days have revealed the candidates' starkly different approaches to leadership. Now, each one has tried to improve his standing on the economy and/or COVID.Now, when Biden though emerges from his comfy basement, he often is just shuffling upstairs to a camera near his French doors with a bucolic scene framing the shot. Yesterday, he tried to show us that he'd be more hands-on regarding the pandemic, offering never before heard solutions like appoint a commanding COVID officer or he'd help small businesses.Oh wait, didn't Trump already do that? Try again, Joe. Well, of course we know, regardless of what he says, the only big thing that poor old Joe would do differently are the lockdowns. In other words, he would mandate a national shelter in place order, which of course would push us toward a socialist cliff and over time, it would end up killing more people than it would save. But of course, he had to start his attempt at relevancy with a shot at the Trump economy.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOE BIDEN, D-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: This man simply doesn't understand. You can't deal with our economic crisis without serving and saving and solving the public health crisis. For all his bluster, about his expertise on the economy, he is unable to explain how he will actually help working families hit the hardest.(END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: I mean, that's laughable. Trump's retort to this is so easy. He kept the economy afloat by signing an unprecedented relief package and his resistance to permanent lockdowns actually helped the economy rebound faster than any of the so-called experts could ever have imagined.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We want to go back to work as opposed to be sort of forced into a position where they're making more money than they expected to make, and the employers are having a hard time getting them back to work. We were very generous with them. I think that it's been a tremendously successful program. We're in a pandemic and yet we're producing tremendous number of jobs. That was something that nobody thought possible.(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM: He's right about that. And beyond the generous checks, and to American workers, more generous than I might have liked, but we are already seeing a recovery; 4.8 million jobs added in June after 2.7 million added in May. So could a Biden economy ever approach that in the middle of a pandemic? Of course not. Because, with no credible plan to create jobs, Biden could only use the Empathizer in Chief approach, while trash-talking school reopening plans.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BIDEN: If you had to put your career on hold indefinitely or senior hours cut or your job lost, the confusion over school reopening only makes things worse.(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM: The confusion over school reopenings? The President has been incredibly consistent on this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: I think they should open the schools, absolutely. I don't consider our country coming back if the schools are closed.Open up our schools, open them up.Data shows children have the lowest fatality risk.UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER: And your son and your grandchildren. Are you comfortable? Do you plan to have them back in person in school this way?TRUMP: Yes, I'm comfortable with that.(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM: But Joe Biden's points on this are all union talking points. Basically, Biden wants to unionize childcare and home health care workers. He wants to give the teachers unions a big basically stay-at-home vacation, keep all the kids at home. And with the health care workers and the other workers getting unionized, who gets to foot that bill?(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BIDEN: And how are we going to pay for is by rolling back unproductive tax cuts, while ensuring high income earners pay their tax bills. We invest that. That would add up to $775 billion over 10 years.(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM: Oh that's a lot of unproductive tax cuts, isn't it? And of course by investment, Joe Biden means spending. There's no such thing as a free lunch or free elder care or free childcare, as nice as that sounds.You'll be billed for the cash with crushing new taxes, while he and his cronies create a new government funded series of unions, all captive to the Democrat Party. But don't worry about all the details. After all, Joe doesn't have to because the press is essentially acting as his campaign comms team. Now, while The President himself, he faces these types of inquiries. \u00a0(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Do you plan to do a national strategy to help us schools reopen and reopen safety?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Do you want the American people to judge you on the ballot in November by how you handled this pandemic? \u00a0UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Three Governors today came out with new orders on mask requirements. Is that something you wish all the Governors would do?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Americans are dying. Are you responsible for that?(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM: OK, nice people. By contrast, this was Biden's Q&A session yesterday.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BIDEN: Thank you for listening. I look forward to having your questions at another time, but I'm off to another event. Thank you Senator.(APPLAUSE)(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM: I mean, they don't even bother shouting questions anymore. He just shuffles off, dodders off the stage; \"Bye Joe\". Now time and again, he devolves into bromides, Biden does, with all the originality of a Hallmark card.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BIDEN: President is supposed to care, to lead, to take responsibility, to never give up. That's what Presidents are supposed to do.(END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: It's like one of those corporate posters. While empathy is nice, don't be fooled by the aw-shucks stuff that he's selling. This is all part of a carefully orchestrated masquerade. \"Look at Joe! He's such a sweet old man and he really cares about us.\"(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: This is Joe Biden's empathy which people believe is a real selling point.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We know Biden has empathy but this time around, he connected policy and empathy.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: He understands that empathy is a huge part of his job.JOY REID, CORRESPONDENT, MSNBC: Would you come back? \u00a0BIDEN: I'd be happy to come back. By the way, we were thinking of you as Vice-President, but then you took this job.(LAUGHTER)So, what can we do?(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM: You know he wanted to just lean in for that shoulder rub, but he got confused he was on satellite. Now, this is the kindly face of an administration that's going to ram through crushing regulations, speech codes, new taxes, reparations and radicalism at every turn.Meanwhile, Biden refuses to subject himself to difficult interviews, either because he is incapable of answering tough questions, cognitive decline, or he is afraid that maybe he will reveal the truth that to survive in his party, he has become little more than a puppet of the radical left and BLM.It's a movement that believes the founders were evil, capitalism is evil, the constitution is evil, most Americans are racists, and that's evil; you get my drift. But we are supposed to believe that the only guy is sweet, old Joe Biden who can save us.Are we supposed to believe now that Obama, he wasn't as talented as Joe is now? I mean they were together for eight years. Well, so Barack Obama wasn't really authentic, couldn't get the job done? The most telling moment over the last few days was when Biden invoked his dad.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BIDEN: He used to have a saying. He said, Joey, I don't expect the government to solve my problems, but I sure as hell expect them to understand my problems.(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM: Well, that's complete nonsense. The government's job is to allow you the freedom to solve your own problems and make your own way. Government doesn't understand anything. It's not a person. We have to see the gauzy Biden sympathy routine for what it is. Just because someone claims to care, it doesn't mean they can make our lives better or strengthen our nation. Jimmy Carter cared. Look where that got us.Time and again, we see Biden wear compassion as fashion, but the I-care- stuff is just a veneer to distract from how far left that he's had to move on almost every major issue facing America. And he is even trying to perfect the squad's racial smears.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BIDEN: No sitting President has ever done this, never, never, never. No Republican President has done this. No Democratic President. We have had racists and they have existed and they have tried to get elected President. He's the first one that has.(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM: Number one, that's disgusting. Number two, it's false and defamatory. Trump shouldn't tolerate this and he should continue to appeal the black voters about the outright lies they are being told in order to hold them back. And number three, it's all very ironic, given Biden's own checkered history on racial rhetoric and his abysmal policy failures. President Trump's slapped back today.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: We passed Criminal Justice Reform, something that Obama and Biden were unable to do. We did opportunity cities. We had the best African American, Hispanic American, Asian American, almost every group was the best for unemployment.(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM: That's what I call caring, results. And you know what real compassion looks like? Offering crime fighting assistance to the most crime ravaged communities in America, where law abiding Americans, many of them black, suffer due to unprosecuted drug and gang violence.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: Today I'm announcing a surge of federal law enforcement into American communities plagued by violent crime.CHARRON POWELL, MOTHER OF LEGEND TALIFERRO: Operation Legend is not to harass. It's not to harm or to hurt. It is to help investigate unsolved murders, in which one of those happens to be our innocent four year-old son. We have to take a stand in our communities and speak up to help this operation.(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM: Everyone should watch that Operation Legend event today. I'll tweet it out later. You'll be better for watching it. Biden is engaged in a high stakes shell game, stoke enough fear in the public about the virus or racism and maybe no one will notice that he's a doddering fool who can't control the mob on the streets or the mob in his own party. This is one care package that will blow up our future if we let it, and that's THE ANGLE.Joining me now is Dr. Ramin Oskoui, CEO of Foxhall Cardiology. We're going to move on a lot of different topics today beyond politics. The big news was the announcement, Dr. Oskoui, that the administration is ordering up to 100 million doses of potential vaccines from Pfizer. That's hopeful news for sure, but any reservations about the speed of it?DR. RAMIN OSKOUI, CEO, FOXHALL CARDIOLOGY: Well, we've skipped a number of trial steps that we often take with vaccines, a number of the animal trials. They're hoping to have this vaccine available by January. Certainly, that's what the contract says.But this is a new viral platform, the mRNA vaccine platform. And we're not even sure it's going to work, especially since it's not geared to go after innate immunity. It's simply an antibody response.INGRAHAM: Dr. Birx talked about the antibody aspect of all of this today on Special Report, watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DR. DEBORAH BIRX, CORONAVIRUS RESPONSE COORDINATOR, WHITE HOUSE: The majority of people around the world, once they're infected, they amount an immune response both what we call the antibody response and the cellular response. It's the roadmap for vaccine development. That's the roadmap for monoclonal antibodies for therapeutics. And I think that's what's so encouraging about this virus and our ability to clear it.(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM: Dr. Oskoui, does this paint a different picture than what the media has been saying? And does that take into account the issue of T-cell immunity that you and I, and so many others in the medical cabinet that we put together, have been referring to?OSKOUI: I think it does. And this has important implications for vaccine development. Vaccines like the AstraZeneca that appear to assist T-cell immunity as well as antibody B-cell immunity are probably likely to be a bit more successful than ones that strictly stimulate antibody immunity. So the short answer is, it has huge implications for vaccine development, but also I think our general understanding of herd immunity and how this virus is going to work itself through and how it's been so deadly.INGRAHAM: Dr. Oskoui, an important response from the CDC Director earlier today when he was asked this question.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Would you be comfortable with your school-aged grandchildren going back to school in the fall?DR. ROBERT REDFIELD, DIRECTOR, CDC: Absolutely. Absolutely.(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM: This is just a purely political calculation these schools are making across the country. Scientific research about kids in school, 2006 Hong Kong's study about the SARS outbreak warned about the adverse psychosocial impact on children. So why is this pro-science party ignoring the science, Dr. Oskoui? \u00a0OSKOUI: You know that's a good question. We locked down this country and never thought of the ramifications in terms of undiagnosed cancers and other issues and the effect on the economy. I think the same thing is true for not having in-person schooling. It's critical that these kids go to school five days a week. They're at low risk and without it, there are going to be clearly, and we have seen this scientifically shown with the SARS epidemic, clearly implications for severe social distancing of children and not having in-person schools. \u00a0INGRAHAM: Dr. Oskoui, as always, we really appreciate your insight tonight.OSKOUI: Thank you.INGRAHAM: And I want to move now to this exchange that made a lot of waves on CNN between the Trump Campaign's Communications Director Tim Murtaugh and CNN host, Brianna Keilar. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TIM MURTAUGH, DIRECTOR, TRUMP CAMPAIGN COMMUNICATIONS: Do you remember the hydroxychloroquine fiasco where the entirety of the media was dead set against anyone ever talking about this simply because The President expressed optimism?(CROSSTALK)BRIANNA KEILAR, HOST, CNN: That's not right because it kills people. We are doing a real disservice to Americans. I just want to be clear to everyone out there. We've talked to a number of doctors and experts, including federal experts. This is not something that you want to be playing with. Alright. Studies have been canceled because this stuff is so dangerous. We are done with this conversation.(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM: Joining me now is an epidemiologist, Dr. Harvey Risch, Professor of Epidemiology at Yale School of Public Health. Dr. Risch, who is really doing the disservice to the American people? Doctors with decades of experience like yourself or the treating physicians on COVID, or CNN hosts who think that hydroxy is so dangerous that we shouldn't even talk about it?DR. HARVEY RISCH, PROFESSOR OF EPIDEMIOLOGY, YALE SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH: Good evening, Laura. That's a little funny that we shouldn't talk about anything. This is a drug that's been used for 65-plus years in billions of doses around the world that people take without even thinking about it. And suddenly it's become dangerous; that's ludicrous.INGRAHAM: The idea that has been floated by yours truly and a few others of giving hydroxychloroquine to those essential workers who want it before they go back to work and a prophylactic dose Dr. Risch, we have some favorable studies on prophylactic use of the drug. What about that? To give people a peace of mind, and where is the FDA on revoking its emergency warning about hydroxy?RISCH: So those are two questions. The first one, there is evidence to show that prophylactic use is at lower doses than treating doses are still beneficial. It's not as strong as the evidence for successful treatment with the drug but still there is evidence for that. One shouldn't be overly confident by taking prophylactic doses that you won't get it, it's still possible, but there is still the possibility of treatments regardless.As to the FDA, I'm hoping that the FDA will in fact change its mind. It will re-evaluate all the evidence that it has and update the evidence and see that there is room for changing its position.INGRAHAM: Now, it's just amazing that we have CNN anchors out there proclaiming on this drug as if they reviewed all the peer-reviewed studies on this. It does such a disservice to people and this has been going on for months and I haven't dropped it because I actually know the science on this, I think pretty well at this point. Dr. Risch, this is what Dr. Fauci said today about the end of the pandemic.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) \u00a0DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, CORONAVIRUS TASK FORCE MEMBER, WHITE HOUSE: I don't see this disappearing the way SARS1 did. The reason I say that is that it is so efficient in its ability to transmit from human to human, that I think we ultimately will get control of it. I don't really see us eradicating it.(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM: Dr. Risch, your reaction to that, is this why therapeutics are so much more important in the short term?RISCH: Well, in the short term, yes. I think that it's hard to predict its ultimate sequence - events, but it's possible that it may circulate like influenza where it's seasonal, eventually that it's better in the Southern hemisphere in our winter - in our summer and comes back in our winter. It's hard to know. And I think that once we have a handle on treatment, then it won't matter so much because the treatment is so very effective.INGRAHAM: Dr. Risch, thank you as always. Great to see you tonight.RISCH: Pleasure.INGRAHAM: And a new media hero has emerged from the smoking rubble of the Pacific Northwest, the Portland Moms. Oh yes. The media loves these folks but wait until you see what we caught them on tape doing. Mollie Hemingway, Lara Logan reacts as I put back my earring on in moments.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. EARL BLUMENAUER, D-ORE.: Portland, Oregon is not out of control but there are some people who have strong feelings.REP. SUZANNE BONAMICI, D-ORE.: They are not welcome to bring these federal officials into our community because they are making things worse and they are hurting people. \u00a0TED WHEELER, MAYOR AND POLICE COMMISSIONER, PORTLAND: Their presence here is actually leading to more violence and more vandalism. They are not wanted here.(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM: It isn't just local officials who are working overtime to downplay the lawlessness and violence plaguing the streets of Portland. The media, well they are joining in and they have a new group of heroes.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: They're calling themselves the Wall of Moms.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: These are the moms that have come out to support this cause.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: A group of moms who've come out there to kind of protect these people.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Dozens of women having formed themselves into a human shield to try to protect the crowd from the federal agents. Moms are here, \"leave our kids alone.\"(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM: This is like (inaudible) unbelievable propaganda. As you see in this video, that same Wall of Moms were part of a group actually seen trying to kick their way into the Federal Courthouse. Joining me now, Lara Logan, host of Lara Logan Has No Agenda on Fox Nation and Mollie Hemingway, Senior Editor at The Federalist, Fox News contributor. Mollie, the Portland moms, OK. This, this really took the cake. It's kind of a microcosm of the media's coverage from Portland and other cities; pay no attention. Everything's peaceful, happy, and even homespun.MOLLIE HEMINGWAY, SENIOR EDITOR, THE FEDERALIST: Well, you see the way that the protesters will say when they see someone filming them to put their cameras down. They don't want the violence to be shown to people. And that's understandable because they know the violence is at odds with their own agenda. That you see so many other people like in the media going along with that is very disturbing.And likewise, this approach of taking your most sympathetic members and putting them as the face of what's going on, this is very common tactic in paramilitary organizations to do that, hide your weaponry in schools or hospitals and whatnot. But again to see the media going along with that and doing these puff pieces is very disturbing.INGRAHAM: Now, Lara, I want to play for you, one BLM protester was caught on tape actually saying; watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Hi everyone. As many of you know, my name is Lilith Sinclair. I am an Afro-Indigenous non-binary local organizer here at Portland, organizing for the abolition of not just the militarized police state but also the United States as we know it.(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM: This is the goal of more of these folks and the media of course, whatever let on. Is that not the case, Lara?LARA LOGAN, HOST, FOX NATION: Well, you know, Laura, I take their word for it, right? Because this woman is not the only one to say that. They say it every single day, all over the internet on thousands of sites. They also have sprayed it all over the walls of the cities where there have been riots, all Democrat controlled cities, by the way. And I say that because it's very significant that these riots are taking place in areas that are where the Democrats can control the messaging.Why? Because when you bring in federal agents, you upset all of that. Now, you don't just have local district attorneys. You're bringing in Assistant U.S. attorneys are coming with those federal agents. The people on the ground who are committing crimes, they can't just be released from prison because now they're being charged with federal crimes. They're facing much more significant charges and longer sentences, and it's also showing how effective local law enforcement and federal law enforcement can be when working together.All of which is outside the control of city officials who --I've been talking to people on the ground in some of these places. And they're just saying that they're tired of being ignored, that there's a group of radicals and a small group who have taken over the city councils, who've taken over the messaging and who are out there on the streets. And they don't represent everyone in these cities.It's not true that everyone in Portland feels this way. But the media isn't even talking to these people and what you're talking about with the moms, this is why I love Mollie, right? Because she's so right. These are deception tactics. They're being used. This is an information war. And they have been trying to say that federal authorities are being misused or overused, painting The President in their strategic messaging as some kind of dictator. And that's because they don't want this tactic being used because it's effective.INGRAHAM: Yes. Let me jump on what you just said there because the rioters are portrayed as the new freedom writers. They're not writers; they're freedom writers. And then the police, any law enforcement, especially federal law enforcement are being demonized including by Joy Reid. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REID: He's using that Trumped up charge to justify what in any other country, particularly authoritarian one, would be called the secret police.Need to have his secret police.There's a secret police aspect of it.These federal secret police.The deploying of secret police.It's a secret police sort to vibe.Using his own secret police.(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM: The former attorney general there, that's just embarrassing. Mollie, secret police that happen to have clearly marked uniforms that are protecting federal property. Boy, the tables are turned here.MOLLIE HEMINGWAY, SENIOR EDITOR, \"THE FEDERALIST\": It's not just that they are clearly marked as police or that they have identifying badges on them. But also, when people are attacking federal courthouses, that is a federal concern. When they are going after federal personnel as they did the Lafayette Park in Washington, D.C., that's a federal concern. And there is actually an obligation to restore law and order. The entire country benefits from how cases are handled at the Mark O. Hatfield Courthouse in downtown Portland, not just the few citizens of Portland.And so even if the Portland mayor wants to allow mobs to control his city, it still is of concern to the rest of the country. And ideally, cities would be handling these issues better on their own and there would be no need for any federal law enforcement agents to have to risk their lives because the mob has gotten out of control. But when cities don't handle their own business and states don't handle their own business, there is a role for the federal government to play, and in fact, not just a role, but an obligation.INGRAHAM: Lara, I was going to play something else from MSNBC.LARA LOGAN, FOX NATION HOST: And Laura, can I get in there?INGRAHAM: Yes, go ahead.LOGAN: I just want to jump in there and say something, because I was on the border with BORTAC and BORSTAR, I was out with these forces. These are highly trained forces. They know exactly what they are doing. They are special operations level inside the Border Patrol. When they're deployed like this, they have markings. They have \"Police\" on the front of their vests, they have it on the back. On both of their arms they have both the Border Patrol patches and the BORTAC patches.And just because local officials and journalists and idiots on the streets there who are rioting, they can't look up what that patch means and they don't know who these people are, doesn't mean that they haven't been identified. And it's very significant that people are lying about this. That is just astonishing to me.INGRAHAM: They know exactly what they're doing. They're not mistaking it. They know it's a lie. That's the real problem here. And by the way, we found out yesterday that at least one of the injured officers may not recover the sight in his eyes because he was hit repeatedly. So the real ramifications, physical safety, physical health and well-being, on top of all of the demonization that's going on here. Ladies, phenomenal analysis, as always. Thank you so much.And coming up, the boys are back in town. Obama, Biden together again. We're going to explain why.And a political loser is being resurrected in a new streaming series? Answers, and Biden's blunders, Raymond Arroyo has it all, \"Seen and Unseen\" next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)INGRAHAM: Welcome to our \"Seen and Unseen\" segment where we expose the stories behind the headlines. A big political reunion was hyped today. For details we're joined by Raymond Arroyo, FOX News contributor.Raymond, Biden and Obama are reuniting, and it feels so good. What is this?RAYMOND ARROYO, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, the Biden campaign, Laura, released a trailer to promote the forthcoming conversation between the political team. It's staged to look like a Netflix special, Laura. They exit from their cars with entourages. They synchronize their elevator exits. Obama even does his trademark bow. And their conversation is played like a streaming event. In a released clip, Obama reveals more than perhaps he intended. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BARACK OBAMA, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT: You are going to be able to reassemble the kind of government that cares about people and brings people together.(END VIDEO CLIP)ARROYO: Reassemble the old Obama team, Laura. Susan Rice, Eric Holder, John Kerry, they're all coming back, you know it.INGRAHAM: They're clearly trotting out Obama because Biden is in trouble, and Obama is the biggest fundraiser the Democrats have. There is no enthusiasm for Biden.ARROYO: No. And it also may have something to do with his poll numbers among black voters. Hillary won 89 percent of the black vote, Laura. According to the latest Zogby poll, only 77 percent of black voters support Biden right now. So he needs Obama to make up that difference and more.Also, the Obama/Biden meet up may be a smokescreen, Laura, to hide the fact that today it was revealed the Biden and Sanders camps have submitted proposals to update the Democratic Party platform. They want to decrease spending on national defense, emphasize police brutality and climate change, propose an end to forever wars -- I thought Trump did that -- and a national proposal to study slave reparations. If that was your agenda, you'd be sitting across from Obama too, Laura.INGRAHAM: First of all, why didn't Obama get all this done in eight years? Was he inadequate? Was he in authentic? So are we supposed to believe that Biden is a smarter political operator then Obama was for eight years, or that Biden was hiding all the solutions from Obama for eight years? He just had the solutions but he was hiding them from him?ARROYO: Well, the visual evidence tells a different story. Biden held a virtual event today with union health care workers, Laura, including a nurse with whom he shared his personal health story.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOE BIDEN, D-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I've been a significant recipient of care. I was hospitalized for a while long time with an aneurysm.What kind of questions did they ask?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: They asked how long was this be going on, when are we going to be able to see our families, when is he going to open up the economy?BIDEN: Do you have any mental health workers at the facility that are able to, we you need that extra help with the patients?(END VIDEO CLIP)ARROYO: For a moment, Laura, I thought he was going to ask Nurse Ann Ryan to find him a bed in her unit. Did you notice she said her patients are hoping Trump will open up the economy? That was probably unrehearsed and unexpected.INGRAHAM: What was that sound? It almost sounded like a coffin was opening at the beginning of the segment.(LAUGHTER)INGRAHAM: I thought someone was coming into the studio here for a moment. What the heck was that?ARROYO: I don't know.INGRAHAM: There were a lot of Biden gaffes, technical and otherwise.ARROYO: Yes, there were.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BIDEN: I'm confused who I'm talking to here, but anyway, whoever it is.Nurses at Walter Reed hospital who would bend down and whisper in my ear, go home and get me pillows. They'd actually breathe in my nostrils to make me move, to get me moving.(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM: What?ARROYO: My Lord, Laura. You can see why a grand total of 26 people watched this event. That was the high point. And incidentally, two of those viewers were myself and one of your producers. That shows you the great groundswell for this event.INGRAHAM: Wait a second, I'm still trying to get over the nurse was breathing into his nostrils?ARROYO: Breathing into his nostrils. This is very odd.INGRAHAM: It's like God breathing into Adam, breathe life into him. What was that?By the way, the comments from nurses who watched that clip, I think Tom Elliott tweeted out, the nurses, I have been nursing for 40 years, I've never breathed into someone's nostrils. What was that? I don't understand that one.ARROYO: Laura, these dry bones could use a little holy spirit power. So we'll be looking for that next. And we're going to rollover. We'll do this special Hulu series when I next join you.INGRAHAM: OK, Raymond, thanks so much.And coming up, we're seeing an alarming trend of China apologists among the most powerful politicians and so-called experts in the U.S. I'm going to call them out and name names in moments. Plus, a U.S. college kicked a Chinese-American students off campus because he commemorated the Tiananmen Square massacre. That student is here next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)INGRAHAM: Something I said for almost 20 years on radio is now finally becoming a consensus view. A lot of this is because of Donald Trump. China and the CCP represent the greatest geopolitical threat to this nation. Our leaders know this, or at least they should. Yet we see example after example of politicians, finance execs, and foreign relations experts acting as surrogates basically for the CCP.Now, take the issue of the coronavirus. The global pandemic spread like wildfire because China refused to sound the alarm, choosing instead to cover up its failures. Now despite this undeniable truth, the speaker of the House is looking to score cheap political points.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. NANCY PELOSI, D-CALIF., HOUSE SPEAKER: A good deal of what we have suffered is clearly the Trump virus.(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM: The CCP thanks you for that propaganda, Madam Speaker. You're hired.Her caucus, of course, take their cues from their own dear leader. Here is Congressman Adam Smith of Washington.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. ADAM SMITH, D-WA.: It's not actually their job to warn the American people. It's the president's job to warn the American people.(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM: To be clear, the Democrat speaker of the House and the Democrat chairman of the Armed Services Committee think it's OK for China to hide information from us. We still haven't gotten all the facts from China that led to the deaths of tens of thousands of Americans. They're going to look the other way as long as they can try to ultimately hurt Donald Trump in an election year. Got it. Nice.While our elected leaders sell us out on China, some of the sages in the international relations community want us to now work more closely with the Chinese communists.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We can't blame China for our own mistakes, for our own policies which have often been inadequate. The United States should not be against China's rise. It should be the goal diplomatically to maintain or preserve or even create areas of cooperation.(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM: What do you think the trade deal was, Richard? I should note that commentary from Mr. Haass was made on CGTM, a network funded by the Chinese government.Meanwhile, the Trump administration was busy busting the CCP for a massive spying ring right here on U.S. soil at the China Houston consulate. Just hours after the State Department ordered that consulate to close down, employees there began burning paperwork in an obvious attempt to hide their efforts.So how do those apologists for China feel now? Remember their names. Remember the words of appeasement toward our greatest foe.And it's not just the leftist politicians, but our university system that's seemingly bowing down to the communist regime. My next guest, a rising senior at Fordham University, claims he is banned now from campus over this Instagram post commemorating the horrific Tiananmen Square massacre. Documents Tong provided to \"The Ingraham Angle\" reveal Fordham claims the posts violated university policy not to threaten or intimidate.Austin Tong joins me now. Austin, the gun is legally owned and you were merely appreciating the Chinese democratic movement. So why would a U.S. university have an issue with this?AUSTIN TONG, FORDHAM UNIVERSITY STUDENT: Hi, Laura. So I think that they would have an issue with anything they disagree with, and they want to silence any voice they don't like. And that is really what happened. And they silenced me because they don't like what I said. And I will not back down to that.INGRAHAM: Austin, you wouldn't be able to say, of course, what you are saying now in China, but I bet you didn't think after coming to the United States and living here, your family, that the long arm of China would reach into the United States with all these kids and scholars from China who have studied here for years and years, and the university is protecting the right to be here and stay here, many of them handpicked by the CCP. But they slap you down and actually ban you from campus?TONG: Supposedly, we have the First Amendment here. We have the Constitution, but that's not what Fordham University thinks. That's not what the bad people, as I call them, the bad people think. And that's why we have to fight back.Look, I'm not going to say sorry. I'm not going to back down. This is not just my case. They took my life away, OK? They put my future into a very bad place. And that's I'm going to bet all my future into this. We'll be fighting hard. I'm going to be suing them very soon. And we're going to be fighting for people across the country. People from across the country came to me, OK, friends and family. We have the NRA, students, the campus reform, media and Instagrammers, we are forming a new movement against this, because no more can we be silenced by the institutions that overpower us. We will let them know there is consequence to this.INGRAHAM: The Justice Department needs to get involved, frankly. These are civil rights that are being summarily -- students being deprived of their civil rights, their free speech. Fordham said that you violated its policy on bias. But listen to an associate professor there, Christina Greer.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CHRISTINA GREER, FORDHAM UNIVERSITY PROFESSOR: Donald Trump has been abysmal for American democracy and is actually poisoning a lot of the soil in America. He's a few months away from just screaming white power. And so he continues with more white nationalist, more white supremacist message day by day.(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM: So I guess, Austin, you can violate their policy, but professors can't?TONG: I think she just said to you that Mr. Trump, after one year, he went to the school. The school right now is a total disaster what they did, it's shameful. And we'll make sure people know about that.INGRAHAM: Keep fighting, Austin. Austin, keep fighting. We're going to following this. We'll have you back. Unbelievable, Fordham University, shame on you.Up next Bill Gates has the inside scoop about your kids going back to school. The Last Bite, next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BILL GATES, CO-FOUNDER, MICROSOFT CORPORATION: If you're in a hot spot, sadly, in this fall, it won't be normal school activities for most high schools and colleges. By fall, 2021, which is a long time from now, I think we'll have things under control enough. But the entire academic year, this next academic year, does hang in the balance.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM: Oh, you hear that? Because it's easy to say when you have tens of billions of dollars. It's not so easy when you need to pull double shifts and rely on public school for your kids.It's all the time we have tonight.

Georgia Governor Brian Kemp, he's come under huge fire for suing localities in his own state over mandating their own COVID-19 rules. He's here to respond to them. Also, tonight, Raymond Arroyo digs into Biden's latest mask ad. It's hilarious. Goya's ultimate revenge and Fauci on the catwalk. \"Friday Follies\" is a must-see, as always. But first, there's no getting around it, according to most polls, President Trump is running behind Joe Biden. The current RCP average has him trailing the Former VP by nearly 9 points. But on the economy, the new \"NBC/Wall Street Journal\" poll gave Trump record high marks on the issue. Well, the story of the moment, however, is COVID. It's dominating everywhere, and it's where voters favor Biden. Now, that shouldn't be the case. And I'm going to tell you why it is. The issues at hand are right in Trump's wheelhouse. Number one, the virus came from China. Trump has been a greater hawk on China than any president in my lifetime, and his ban on travel, without a doubt, saved thousands of lives. Number two. When PPE, ventilators, mobile hospitals, et cetera were needed, Trump answered the call. He mobilized all the right people. His administration marshaled both the government and private companies, and they delivered in rapid speed and historic fashion. And number three, to get out of this mess, we're going to need an unprecedented economic revival, an issue, as we noted above, Trump dominates. All right. Continue to hold firm on all three and remind Americans, Mr. President, that you're going to put them first. Joining me now is Sara Carter, Fox News Contributor, host of \"The Sara Carter Show\" podcast. Also, with me, Lara Logan, host of \"Lara Logan Has No Agenda\" on Fox Nation, and Tom Bevan, Co-Founder and President of RealClearPolitics. Tom, let's start with you. Does President Trump have the potential to turn voters' opinions around on just that issue of handling COVID? TOM BEVAN, PRESIDENT, REALCLEARPOLITICS: Well, that's a good question. I mean, when this initially started, his approval rating on COVID was very positive. He has over 50 percent approval in positive territory, but he's had a pretty steady and slow decline over the past few weeks to the point now where he's at his lowest point. I think it's about - under 40 percent in our RealClearPolitics average. So I'm not sure how many - I mean - and really what he's lost are a little bit of Republicans, but mostly independents. Democrats were never with him in the first place. They've never approved of his handling of anything, let alone COVID. So he's really got to win back independents. And there's still time to do that. It's still possible. I don't think they've totally tuned him out yet on the issue of his handling of COVID. INGRAHAM: Now, Sara, I was talking today to a couple of restauranteurs. I happened to know a lot of restauranteurs in the area. They're really having a hard time because they're getting mixed signals, open, close, 75 percent, 50 percent. Virginia is doing pretty well on the COVID front right now, but they get a sense that any moment the rug is going to be pulled out from under them. When does that begin to turn a bit in the President's favor if he says we've got to move on with life and try to take sensible measures at the same time? SARA CARTER, \"THE SARA CARTER SHOW\" PODCAST AND FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: I think you brought up such a great point, and I think that's the administration - that's up to the administration to make that message clear and to make sure that that narrative sticks that there isn't any back and forth. I mean, think about what President Trump has already done, Laura. I mean, he has cut back over 25,000 pages - he even talked about that this week - of regulations that brought small businesses back booming in America. When COVID finally comes down, when we've got to recover and we are in the recovery process at the very beginnings of this, we need a president that is going to reinvigorate the economy, bring back business. And that will include deregulations, that will include pushing the economy forward, especially in minority communities. We're not going to see that from Vice President Biden at all. In fact, he's announced a $2 trillion climate policy plan that's going to initiate a bundle of regulations and really squeeze the small business owner and the workforce, and that's the restauranteurs that you're talking about. These are the people, the American workforce. And President Trump has this. He can move this forward. I really believe that this is a glass-half-full situation, Laura, and I think that if the President sticks to the narrative, continues to deliver the message to the American people that he delivered in 2016, he will clench this. There is a lot of time-- INGRAHAM: Yes. CARTER: --between now and November. INGRAHAM: All right. If you want to be locked in, vote for Biden, because it looks like they're beginning-- CARTER: Right. INGRAHAM: --new lockdowns, especially in blue states. All right. Lara, despite Biden's - you have to call it a decline, a clear decline, and no real campaign, the media are fawning all over him. Watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) \u00a0UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: This afternoon, a blistering indictment of Trump from Joe Biden-- MIKA BRZEZINSKI, MSNBC HOST: The basement approach, which Trump makes fun of, actually focuses his message, focuses his empathy, focuses the fact that he knows what he is talking about-- JOHN HEILEMANN, MSNBC NATIONAL AFFAIRS ANALYST: The President is incredibly frustrated in that he cannot find an effective frame for Joe Biden. This is like the nightmare candidate for him. (END VIDEO CLIP) \u00a0INGRAHAM: Lara, how big of a problem is it that we don't have any semblance of an objective press less than four months out of a Presidential election? LARA LOGAN, INVESTIGATIVE JOURNALIST AND FOX NATION HOST: Well, these are all the same people who predicted that Trump would lose the election in 2016. And since then, it's only gotten worse because many people that I speak to say why wouldn't they just come out and admit that they really are not objective in any way and that they just hate this President, and they'll do anything to stop him being reelected because that's very obvious to most people. And you always wonder with these polls, first of all, why anyone is listening to the polls because they were all wrong last time as well. And also, many people that I speak to pay absolutely no attention to them, because the one question they say that polls are not asking is how many people are - how many lives is it costing to save each person from this virus. And that's the question that really resonates with people all over this country. Maybe it's because I live in (inaudible) country, but it's all the people are talking about here from morning to night. They don't trust the numbers. They don't trust the CDC. They take the virus very seriously indeed. It should not be mistaken for people being skeptics or doubters or doubting the severity of the illness that results from this virus. It's not that at all. But what they see is that people are being geographically isolated, the response to the virus has become increasingly political, the impact that it's having on the election makes people nervous with mail-in ballots and the restrictions on gathering indoors and the social distancing, et cetera, et cetera. And people are increasingly concerned about the suicide rate, depressions, the cost to many children when you're told to stay safe, stay in the safety of your home and your home isn't safe at all. And so people are really - they're sort of rebelling against what they see as a form of control, political control, which goes - yes - which goes hand-in-hand with skepticism about it and a lack of trust in the numbers. INGRAHAM: It's a healthy skepticism, I think. And just so people understand, the polls, just we'll put them up for a moment. 2016, Clinton held a double-digit lead of 12 points over president - Donald Trump at that time. I want to just go one step further with you, Tom, and go back to what we talked about really quickly. The lockdowns, how popular will they be when they start rolling back into effect and you sense it's coming in a number of states? There's is a crescendo building even in the media and among some politicos. Check it out. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) \u00a0UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I think a strong argument can be made for a significant mitigation efforts, even shutting down for a few weeks. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This continuing rising outbreak that is going to necessitate more lockdown-- \u00a0UNIDENTIFIED MALE: --where they need a statewide shutdown, a shelter-in- place-- (END VIDEO CLIP) \u00a0INGRAHAM: So, again, this is what they're egging on, Tom. Will this be popular October 1st when things begin to lock down right before an election? BEVAN: Hard to say. Again, people are very concerned about the virus and they want to stay safe. But at the same time, there are economic trade- offs, as we've seen, with the explosion in the unemployment rate. I mean, what this really also plays into, Laura, is the whole issue of schools. And there, that couldn't be a starker divide between Donald Trump and the Republicans wanting to reopen schools and really some of the Democrats and blue state mayors and governors who are basically saying, agreeing with the teachers union, saying we need to go online. There was a pull-out this week that says 74 percent of people say that that's the most important thing. The top priority for the government should be reopening schools safely. It well outpaces anything else - business, churches, any of that stuff. And parents are really worried about this because it has an economic component. If they can't get the kids back in school, it puts a current vulnerability to work. So - and that's a pretty potent political issue. It's top of mind for voters. And that in combination with an economic lockdown, again, it will be pretty stark divide between President Trump and Joe Biden-- INGRAHAM: Yes. I think it's going to be-- BEVAN: --leading up to the election. INGRAHAM: I think it's going to be liberty versus lockdown. I think that's going to be the theme. Really quickly, Sara, Nancy Pelosi today was yearning for something. I want to show you what it is. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) \u00a0REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA): We're in a very critical place. I yearn for other Republican presidents. While we may have disagreed on many points, at least we had a shared commitment to the governance of our country. (END VIDEO CLIP) \u00a0INGRAHAM: She yearns for other Republicans, Sara. She yearns for them. CARTER: Right. Right. She yearned for the old establishment, Laura. That's what this is all about. The fight is not even so much with President Trump. It's a fight with the American people. They don't want the American people disrupting what they had. That stability, that establishment, that ability to do whatever they want without question. And now we're holding them accountable. And that's what this Presidency was all about. It was about holding Washington accountable and cleaning out the swamp. And the American people still want that. They need that. But what they need is the administration to stand up, to deliver that message to stay strong on that message, and to let people know that, look, we haven't given up this fight, we're out here every single day and we're not going to let it happen. And Tom brought up a great point, and so did you. We want to see our children back in school, and we want some normalcy back in our lives. And that's what's going to take this election all the way in November. INGRAHAM: Yes. Real - and again, real quick, Lara. On the idea of yearning for the past, in 2008 - I'm sure you remember this - when George W. Bush gave a speech in Israel and was referencing basically - I'm summarizing - about aiding and abetting terrorists with the lingo of Barack Obama or - something like that. She said, well, \"the comments were beneath the dignity of the office.\" I mean, they were strafing George W. Bush in 2008, and now suddenly we're yearning for other Republican presidents. I don't know who she's talking about then. LOGAN: Well, it's interesting, Laura, because Nancy Pelosi now has some strong allies on the right. And there's a vocal minority who are just as vicious about President Trump as the Democrats. And a lot of people that I've spoken say that's because when the President does something like, for example, Space Force, taking a program that was classified for years and putting it into the light, that's trillions of dollars in dark money that is now in the light. And what you've done then is effectively draining the swamp financially in a massive way. And most people don't pay any attention to this. But it means that people on the left and the right, the establishment that Sara was talking about, those people have lost a lot of their advantage that they had. And that's where the ordinary person here says that Donald Trump is a President of change. They never wanted him to be seen as a President of change. If you go back to the propaganda from the very moment that he won the election, it said, \"This presidency is not about change.\" Well, because that tells you that that's exactly what it's about. And one of the disturbing things here that people have raised with me is all the talk about Trump is not going to leave office and Trump won't hand over the nuclear codes. What are they setting the conditions for, exactly? If there is any dispute over mail-in ballots or voter fraud or any of those states or giving all their votes to the popular vote winners nationwide and not given their Electoral College votes-- INGRAHAM: Right. LOGAN: --as they traditionally have been given. INGRAHAM: Yes. Got to go. LOGAN: If there's any dispute over that, are they going to say, yes, you see there, we told you he wasn't going to leave office? INGRAHAM: They're going to short-circuit it. They don't want anyone to question them, Lara. You're exactly right. It's going to be any irregularities, no, you're questioning the results of an election, you got to get out, and we hope the military will help-- LOGAN: Yes. INGRAHAM: --throw him out of the White House. That's exactly what they're setting up. Fascinating conversation, panel. Thank you so much. LOGAN: Exactly. INGRAHAM: Great to see you all tonight. Up next, we talked to the Governor trying to protect his citizens' lives and liberty by pushing back on oppressive lockdowns. That man, Governor Brian Kemp, joins us in moments. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) \u00a0INGRAHAM: While some governors are using the COVID crisis to grab more power and undermine their citizens' Constitutional rights, my next guest is among those actually trying to preserve liberty while also saving lives and he's taking on officials in his own state to do it. Georgia Governor Brian Kemp is suing the City of Atlanta for mandating masks but mainly for going back into lockdown. This morning, Atlanta's Mayor responded. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) \u00a0MAYOR KEISHA LANCE BOTTOMS, (D) ATLANTA: It is mind-boggling that this Governor wastes resources on suing me personally and our city council for mask mandate and advisory voluntary business recommendations and guidelines. It is very clear that he is putting politics over people. It is really a distraction from what the real enemy is here. (END VIDEO CLIP) \u00a0INGRAHAM: Governor Kemp joins me now, exclusively. Governor, it's great to see you. What's your response to the Mayor there? GOV. BRIAN KEMP (R-GA): Laura, let me tell you what's really going on in Georgia. I'm working very hard every day and have been for a long time now to protect the lives as well as the livelihoods of my fellow citizens. However, we have people, local mayors that are playing politics. They want to go back to shelter-in-place, they want to stop in-person dining with no notice, just pulling the rug out from under people. And I'm just not going to allow that to happen. We're fighting two battles here now, one to protect lives but also to protect livelihoods. And so I've filed a lawsuit to stop them because those orders are in conflict with the statewide order that I have executed for the public health state of emergency. INGRAHAM: Well, Governor Kemp, there are those who would say, look, if the masks help in 10 percent of the cases, then why isn't that good enough to just say, look, you can save some lives, maybe they're not 100 percent, isn't that worth this ongoing mask mandate some of these mayors have in place. What would your response to that be? KEMP: I think a little differently on that. Dr. Toomey, I'm still following the health advice that she's giving me. She's a 40-year epidemiologist, Harvard-educated, great person, lot of experience as much as anybody in the country. I don't feel like a mandate is needed for Georgians to do the right thing. We have existing orders on the books, Laura. And this is what's so frustrating about the lot of the locals that are playing politics with this, as we have orders on the books that has worked in the past, that helped us flatten the curve, that helped us stop the spread. They have the ability through my order to use their law enforcement to enforce those orders, and they're not doing that. And that's what I've been telling them. Instead of having a government mandate, enforce the orders that we have, make sure businesses are following the rules, people are socially distancing. I've been talking about people wearing a mask as much as anybody. And I said today in my press conference, for those that do not want to wear a mask, if you have a health condition that prevents it or some sort of phobia or anything else, just socially distance yourself. If everybody does their part, we'll flatten the curve again, we'll stop the spread, and we can continue to reopen our economy. But it's so important that we do that. I mean, we literally have people that are living paycheck-to-paycheck. They're barely getting by in this economic environment. Our business owners - the amount of mortgages aren't being paid on time is going up. And we're looking at large companies like Delta Air Lines and others that in the future if the economy doesn't rebound, they're going to be forced to start laying people off. So we've got to keep our economy open but also fight the virus and protect lives. And that's what we're doing. INGRAHAM: Governor Kemp, this is kind of a controversial question. But do you think that there is something else going on here where there's some element within the Democrat Party who think a shutdown - yes, it probably would save lives, people would be at home - but that that would actually pull the brakes on a recovery, which is obviously underway before a Presidential election. I'm asking that because that's what so many of my viewers are wondering, saying, wait a second, we know there are some hotspots that you're dealing with those, but you shut this economy down in a lot of states again and we're toast. KEMP: Yes, people can't handle it. I wouldn't be able to speak to their politics. It certainly seems like they're trying to undermine our economic recovery. I'm as concerned about the virus as anybody. We're working with our local school leaders and our school superintendent to get schools open. I got just accosted when I started opening businesses early on by the left because they were making fun of us opening barbershops and hair salons, and now they're saying that the guidance that we had, having people wear a mask and use PPE and having these rules in places, have kept the spread down in our salons and barbershops. So I don't - I don't know - I mean, it's got to be pandemic politics. But I know this. Talking to our hospital CEOs, they cannot go through what we did before. They will not be financially viable. It will bankrupt our hospitals. INGRAHAM: Yes. KEMP: We've heard from restauranteurs out there that are like, if we have to shut down again, if we have to move away-- INGRAHAM: No, it's over. KEMP: --from in-person dining, we're out for good. INGRAHAM: No, it's over. Finally-- (CROSSTALK) KEMP: --our state can't afford that. INGRAHAM: Finally, sir, really quick. University of Georgia, are they going to be playing football in the fall? KEMP: Well, I've told all the young people, including my daughters, who are doing a really good job of following guidance most of the time, that our young folks need to wear a mask if they're going out and they can't socially distance, and they've got to follow the guidance and the advice if they want college football this fall. That is like a religion here in the south. (LAUGHTER) \u00a0INGRAHAM: Exactly. KEMP: I want to see it happen. It's a huge economic impact, but we need it mentally as a society right now. So that's why I'm asking everybody, for the next four weeks, wear a mask, socially distance, wash your hands, and follow the existing guidance that we have. It will work-- INGRAHAM: All right. KEMP: --and flatten the curve. INGRAHAM: Governor, great to see you tonight. Thanks for fighting for small businesses and parents and people who want to go to school, and it's inspiring to see. I'm glad you're out there doing it. And best of luck to you, sir. KEMP: God bless you. INGRAHAM: All right. In speaking of masks, they were the animating feature of Dr. Fauci's interview with Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg. But did Fauci hit the mark? Here now is Dr. Ramin Oskoui, cardiologist, CEO of Foxhall Cardiology. Dr. Oskoui, you just heard Governor Kemp. He said that, look, if young people wear masks and socially distance, they'll have a better chance of having a football season, going back to college. And that's fine. I think people are going to try to do what they can do. But we've already exposed that the science behind regular cloth mask wearing, not surgical mask or the N95, is a little dubious. So, in this interview, we were talking about with Mark Zuckerberg, Fauci strongly recommended mandating masks, including ones that are not medical grade. Watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) \u00a0DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, WHITE HOUSE CORONAVIRUS TASK FORCE MEMBER: The recommendation was not to wear a mask because of the shortage of it. Two things happened. One, it became clear that we had enough of equipment. So there was no shortage. It became clear that cloth coverings that you didn't have to buy in a store, that you can make yourself, were adequate. (END VIDEO CLIP) \u00a0INGRAHAM: OK. That's the rub there. Is it not, Dr. Oskoui? DR. RAMIN OSKOUI, CEO, FOXHALL CARDIOLOGY: Yes. INGRAHAM: Are cloth coverings making people safer and adequate? OSKOUI: I think the short answer is no. There actually are studies that have shown that cloth masks are next to worthless. And there is some question whether by holding on to those particles, you may actually be making yourself sick. INGRAHAM: Or certainly more susceptible to-- OSKOUI: Absolutely. INGRAHAM: --to getting some of these viruses. Was that the Vietnamese study, I believe? Was that-- OSKOUI: Correct. INGRAHAM: Am I getting that right? OK. OSKOUI: It is. It is, yes. INGRAHAM: All right. Zuckerberg also asked Fauci this question. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) \u00a0MARK ZUCKERBERG, CEO, FACEBOOK: --breathing in more carbon dioxide. Are there any issues like that? And from all of the studies around this, has anything negative been found? FAUCI: Not at all, Mark. There has not been any indication that putting a mask on and wearing a mask for a considerable period of time has any deleterious effects on oxygen exchange-- (END VIDEO CLIP) \u00a0INGRAHAM: Well, that's maybe on oxygen. That is correct. Correct? OSKOUI: That's correct for most patients. But there are some patients who are a bit fragile. Those with emphysema who are wearing a mask can - can possibly be problematic. Yes. INGRAHAM: And it looks like-- OSKOUI: That's not entirely true. INGRAHAM: And it looks like the concerns we had on the show about the accuracy of COVID death counts, Dr. Oskoui, and you've been part of this conversation for months now-- OSKOUI: Sure. INGRAHAM: --that were well placed. An investigation by Fox Orlando is now revealing that a victim of a motorcycle accident was actually labeled as a COVID death. OSKOUI: Yes. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) \u00a0UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We're discussing and trying to argue with the state. Not because of the numbers. I mean, it's 100. It doesn't make any difference if it's 99. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: But the validity that the fact that the individual didn't die from COVID-19, died in the crash. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: First of all, I can't hear what anyone is saying in a mask, number one. Number two, Dr. Oskoui, how pervasive do you think reporting errors like this are? It's just - is this just a one-off? OSKOUI: I don't think it's a one-off. I think what HHS has to do is audit every COVID death and every COVID diagnosis of every hospital. Remember, we're paying bonus money to patients who are intubated for COVID and who are diagnosed as having COVID in the hospital. That's coming to hundreds of millions of dollars. I think - so the American people don't get cheated, these hospitals need to be audited, every single one of them, every single case. INGRAHAM: The hydroxychloroquine study, Dr. Oskoui, that was touted by CNN as showing, see, we told you so, no benefit to hydroxychloroquine. 15 seconds. Why was that junk? OSKOUI: Well, it's a small study, interestingly, underpowered by Bowers (ph) own admission. And as you see, with an intention to treat protocol, they had a 60 percent reduction in mortality. It's - there are much better studies, much bigger studies that clearly show efficacy in the same population. INGRAHAM: Yes. And actually talk to treating physicians, let them make their own decisions since the drug is very safe. OSKOUI: Yes. INGRAHAM: Dr. Oskoui, as always, invaluable analysis. Thanks so much. OSKOUI: My pleasure. Thank you. INGRAHAM: And up ahead, we unmask Joe Biden's new ad and the media's embarrassing meltdown over Trump's and Goya Foods. It's \"Friday Follies\" next.

Now back to \"The Ingraham Angle.\" INGRAHAM: It's Friday, and that means it's time for \"Friday Follies.\" Joining us with all the details, Raymond Arroyo, FOX News contributor. Raymond, Biden released an ad this week in Texas that was rather peculiar. RAYMOND ARROYO, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: It's clear that his running mate so far, Laura, seems be COVID-19. But he's all in on wearing masks, mostly. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: This virus is tough, but we can stop the spread. Wear a mask. We're all in this together. We'll fight this together. I'm Joe Biden, and I approve this message. (END VIDEO CLIP) (LAUGHTER) ARROYO: I guess wear a mask except when you meet strangers at a rally, in which case you don't have to wear a mask at all, I guess. Laura, I'm stunned that a PSA is now a campaign slogan. What's next? don't smoke? Wear your seatbelt? He seems to be running for surgeon general rather than president. INGRAHAM: I'm just glad -- they need a bubble wrap between him and all those young women that he -- there needs to be a Plexiglas divider between Biden and any female person at a rally. You just know that arm is coming across. What else, Ray? ARROYO: Laura, you had the Goya CEO on after Julian Castro and AOC and others attempted to boycott his company. This came in response to the CEO of Goya's appearance at a Trump event. This week, Ivanka Trump and the president posted their support for the company on social media, and the talking heads exploded. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CHRIS CUOMO, CNN ANCHOR: On your dime, in the middle of a pandemic, they are selling beans. You tell me how a president in the middle of the pandemic has got time for this --? Are you kidding me? Hawking products? (END VIDEO CLIP) ARROYO: In the middle of the pandemic, Laura Ingraham. Chris Cuomo forgets to remind his viewers what he and his brother, the love gov, were doing during a pandemic. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CHRIS CUOMO, CNN ANCHOR: In scale, this was the actual swab that was being used to fit up that double barrel shotgun that you had mounted on the front of your pretty face. Do you think that you are an attractive person now because you're single and ready to mingle? GOV. ANDREW CUOMO, (D) NEW YORK: I think beauty is in the eye of the beholder. (END VIDEO CLIP) (LAUGHTER) INGRAHAM: Don't you miss those? I miss those. ARROYO: So that's perfectly acceptable during a pandemic. INGRAHAM: I miss those, don't you? ARROYO: I do, too. The Cuomo bro show was classic. And look, for the record, Laura, Michelle Obama in conjunction with her Let's Move initially, you remember this, she openly courted support and promoted a number of well-known American brands, Goya included, by the way. INGRAHAM: Well, she was doing it to help everybody lose weight and get healthy. Did we ever do the review on how well the Let's Move program did? Did we reduce obesity in the United States? I must have missed that. ARROYO: I don't think we did. INGRAHAM: Overall reduction, we have more food deserts and we have more obesity post move on. But great idea. And then Joy Behar, she was on \"The View,\" and she extolled the virtues of boycotts. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOY BEHAR, CO-HOST, \"THE VIEW\": We would still have apartheid, for example, in South Africa now if other countries including the United States did not boycott South Africa. Boycotts are extremely, extremely effective. (END VIDEO CLIP) ARROYO: Laura, Goya is not enslaving people abroad unlike many of these -- unlike China and many of these companies that do business with them. The other thing the Biden folks and AOC and company have to be very careful of. We Hispanics are now 20 percent, almost 20 percent of this population, 60 million. They have to be careful when they boycott a brand like this that's Hispanic owned and operated. It has the risk of upsetting a whole lot of your voters out there. INGRAHAM: Look, if we had Behar out their lobbying to divest from China, then I'd actually take her a little bit more seriously. But she's going back to 1984 and the divestment from South Africa for the analogy. If you really want to take this to where it needs to go, don't focus on the U.S. police departments. Focus on what's happening in China where they are loading people on trains and taking them to lord knows where. But come on, this is ridiculous. Good for the Goya CEO. ARROYO: This was a very strange week. While the president was being wrapped for posing with beans, Dr. Fauci was being hailed for posing next to his pool for an \"InStyle\" magazine cover. Look at this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Fauci told \"InStyle\" magazine \"I don't like conflict.\" UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Fauci conceded his straight talk has rankled White House officials, telling \"InStyle\" magazine, \"Well, you know, that really changes week to week and month to month.\" UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: He's done a new interview, and people are kind oif going, you know, it's kind of great. (END VIDEO CLIP) (LAUGHTER) ARROYO: Kind of great. Norah O'Donnell conducted this probing interview for \"InStyle,\" Laura, where we learned his exercise habits and what Dr. Fauci eats in the morning. Melania Trump is still waiting for her \"InStyle\" cover, I'll just point that out. INGRAHAM: We talked about this with Dr. Oskoui, but he did this live interview with Mark Zuckerberg. ARROYO: I saw it. INGRAHAM: A lot of people on the livestream are like is Mark Zuckerberg trying out for a position on \"60 Minutes,\" because he was like, well, tell us about this? People don't want to stay in their lanes. They want to go in every lane. If they ever do the movie, forget Brad Pitt. I was thinking they should try to find out wherever Lee Strasberg is. Remember, he was in \"Godfather II.\" He would be the perfect Anthony Fauci, just saying. Sadly, he's no longer with us. INGRAHAM: That is genius, but that exhumation of the body would probably upset the family, Raymond. All right, Raymond, have a great weekend. We'll wait for your \"InStyle\" profile soon. ARROYO: I will, too. INGRAHAM: And worst in media, who are the biggest offenders of the week? We'll tell you. Plus Bill Barr's grave warning to American businesses on China, and the disturbing response he got. It was amazing speech, and you didn't see any of it. We'll bring it to you. Don't go away. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) INGRAHAM: It's easy to become numb to media bias these days, I get it, but \"The Ingraham Angle\" is keeping track of the worst offenders of the week for you. Joining me now is Adam Guillette, president of \"Accuracy in Media.\" Adam, good to see you tonight. Let's begin with Katy Tur's mindless rant defending BLM protests. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KATY TUR, MSNBC HOST: Mandate masks. I don't understand the pushback on it. It just doesn't make any sense when you think about it logically. The protests were outdoors. All of the doctors and health experts say that that is a safer place to hold them. I attended a number of those rallies. Everybody was wearing a mask. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Later in the show Chuck Todd hit back against a guest who called out their own media bias. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CHUCK TODD, MSNBC HOST: Just a reminder, for what it's worth, there is no editorial point of view here on any of these newscasts on MSNBC in the daytime. (END VIDEO CLIP) (LAUGHTER) INGRAHAM: I'm going to -- that, I didn't even know he said that. That's -- Adam, he's got to be kidding me. ADAM GUILLETTE, PRESIDENT, ACCURACY IN MEDIA: MSNBC denies being an opinion channel, pretends to be a news channel, but in reality, they're a comedy channel. You don't even need the volume. Just look at the chyrons. The headlines on the screen read like something that you would see on Facebook from your liberal nephew who is at Berkeley. Their stuff is out of control. And their coverage of Black Lives Matter is hysterically ridiculous. It's great just watching for the laughs. INGRAHAM: Just the lower third, the scroll, Donald Trump wants kids to die from COVID. It is the most inflammatory stuff. And up next, MSNBC's Jason Johnson, he is just one of the many commentators peddling this sick conspiracy theory. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JASON JOHNSON, MSNBC CONTRIBUTOR: Because so many of these ballots are going to be coming in by mail, we're not going to have a new president on election night. It's going to take weeks. You're going to have militia showing up at vote counting locations threatening people. We have a president who is a proto-dictator, and he will do anything in his power to stay, regardless of what the actual numbers say. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Adam, I fully expect they are going to perhaps not expect a win by Donald Trump on election night, because they will say we'll find ballots in the back of someone's car somewhere. But as far as the militia showing up, why has this become such a prevailing claim on the left? GUILLETTE: Think about the history. They haven't accepted a defeat a presidential election in AOC's lifetime. They didn't accept the W. defeat. They didn't accept the Trump defeat. They're still skeptical about 1988 when they blame the Willie Horton ad for things. It's out of control. And their talk about violence and militias, that is projection if I've ever seen it. These are people who don't believe in individualism, don't believe in liberty. They only believe in brute force to advance their means. That's why they're symbol is the fist. You see them on the ground in CHAD in Seattle. They are armed carrying weapons, yet they admonish anybody else who carries weapons and exercises Second Amendment rights. INGRAHAM: Now, let's move on to this pathetic attempt to blame law-abiding gun owners for the recent crime wave. Here's the headline from \"The Washington Post,\" \"Spike in violent crime follows rise in gun buying amid social upheaval.\" And the very first line of the article actually says \"Americans purchased millions more guns than usual this spring, spurred in large part by racial animosity.\" Adam, I guess they've interviewed all these gun owners? How does \"The Washington Post\" actually get away with framing things like this? GUILLETTE: It's ridiculous that they try to pretend that gun rights is a racial institution when in fact gun control is the most racist institution. One of our investigative journalists was on the ground in CHAD a few weeks ago, and he got a Marxist saying something I totally agree with. The Marxist reminded everyone that gun control laws were racist laws. They were created to take gun rights away from freed slaves. If you want to be upset about racist institutions, take down gun control laws and celebrate gun rights. INGRAHAM: CHAZ, CHOP, whatever we're going to call it, Adam, great to see it tonight. Have a great weekend. And in moments, A.G. Bill Barr's devastating takedown of Hollywood and big tech's cozy relationship with China. I've been waiting for someone to say this. It's one of the most consequential speeches on the subject in just a moment. Stay there. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) INGRAHAM: This did not get nearly the attention it deserved, especially considering the importance of the topic. Yesterday Attorney General Bill Barr delivered a stark warning on the dangers of further economic and cultural entanglement with communist China. First, to the big business interests and globalists pushing for more trade with China, Barr had this to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WILLIAM BARR, U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL: The ultimate ambition of China's rulers isn't to trade with the United States. It is to raid the United States. If you are an American business leader, appeasing the PRC may bring short-term rewards, but in the end, the PRC's goal is to replace you. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: It was a tour de force. China isn't just looking to control our industries but our cultural institutions as well, from universities to the film industry. Barr called out these bad actors as well. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BARR: Hollywood now regularly sensors its own movies to appease the Chinese Communist Party, the world's most powerful violator of human rights. Chinese government censors don't need to say a word because Hollywood is doing their work for them. This is a massive propaganda coup for the Chinese Communist Party. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: No wonder no one covered this, it was great. And finally, Barr took aim at the American industry perhaps most submissive to the whims of Beijing. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BARR: Hollywood is far from alone in kowtowing to the PRC. America's big tech companies have also allowed themselves to become pawns of Chinese influence. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: And wittingly or unwittingly, they are aiding and abetting China's mass surveillance and censorship of its own citizens, not to mention the brutal oppression of the Uighur Muslims. Instead of viewing it as a need wake-up call, some shortsighted critics lashed out, even going so far as to call Barr's speech worse than McCarthyism. Be sure to remember the names of those critics. With just over 100 days until the election, the Trump administration is clear eyed about the threat of China as the president has been for many decades. Don't for a second think the Biden presidency will offer anything different than Hollywood and big tech's complete submission to Xi and his communist cronies. \"The Ingraham Angle\" gets results again. We're going to tell you, next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) INGRAHAM: \"The Ingraham Angle\" gets results. Just look at this week. After our coverage of the African-American History Museum's website on race, well, they took it down. That's a victory. We also exposed the racist diversity training given to government employees. We hope someone who can end that is watching. That's all the time we have tonight. Shannon Bream and the fantastic \"FOX News at Night\" team.

Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo.Joining us straight ahead right here on \"Sunday Morning Futures\": a crime at the epidemic sweeping the United States and cities across the country, amid calls to defund the police. The murder rate spikes in California, New Orleans, Los Angeles, with shootings in Chicago jumping 75 percent in June alone.Coming up, America's mayor, Rudy Giuliani, with a message for New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, shootings there up 130 percent, the violence unfolding against the backdrop of the 2020 election, now just 113 days away.What's President Trump's plan to get us out of this? White House trade adviser Peter Navarro is here to lay out POTUS' second-term agenda.We will also hear from Donald Trump Jr. this morning on the one issue he thinks will determine the winner, all of this as John Durham continues his deep dive into the origins of the Russia probe. Will he finish his investigation before the election? Congressman Jim Jordan, ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee, will weigh in.Also here this morning, Senator John Barrasso with breaking news on the next stimulus package and when to expect it.All that and a lot more, as we look ahead right now on \"Sunday Morning Futures.\"And we begin with Joe Biden unveiling his $700 billion buy America plan last week, with an emphasis on U.S. goods, jobs and manufacturing.Biden's proposal may ring the bell for viewers of this program.Here's White House trade adviser Peter Navarro just a few weeks ago on the president's first plan back on March 15.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PETER NAVARRO, DIRECTOR, WHITE HOUSE OFFICE OF TRADE AND MANUFACTURING POLICY: It's a three-pronged strategy consistent with what President Trump has done from the get-go in terms of onshoring jobs.It's buy American, it's deregulate, and it's innovate technology. The buy American issue, Maria, is, we have HHS, the VA and DOD as large consumers of pharmaceuticals. We have got to get them to buy American over the long term, so we have a stable source of demand, so that that will attract investment.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: And joining me right now is Peter Navarro, back with us. He's assistant to the president for trade and manufacturing.Peter, it is good to see you this morning.NAVARRO: Hey, Maria.BARTIROMO: Well, obviously, Joe Biden agrees...NAVARRO: Yes. Yes.BARTIROMO: ... with your plan to buy America.Your reaction to the former vice president's economic plan released this past week.NAVARRO: A poll-driven, plagiarist, buy China Joe Biden.I was astonished by that, given Joe Biden's history. I think everybody remembers back in 1988, when Biden ran for president, and did the trifecta of plagiarism, when he ripped off JFK, RFK and Neil Kinnock in speeches and had to withdraw from the race in shame and embarrassment.And now he's just blatantly ripping off the president's buy American agenda, which goes back to the president going down the escalator with beautiful Melania. It started back then. Guess what?I have personally been at the president's side when he has signed at least seven buy American orders. That's seven more than Biden signed or Obama signed during their term. And every one of those has worked to create American jobs.We dramatically reduced the waivers, increased the amount of buy American in-government procurement. We upped the amount of iron and steel to close to 100 percent.And so, listening to Joe Biden, I thought it was a really bad judgment. And whoever wrote that speech and put that in the puppet's head there, I think they might be looking for a new job soon.BARTIROMO: Well, Peter, he also said that he will take the corporate tax rate back up.The president, of course, in his tax legislation of 2017 cut the corporate rate to 21 percent. Biden says it should be at 28 percent. Wall Street seems to think Elizabeth Warren is the key economic voice in Biden's plan. She wants to raise taxes on everyone and also institute a wealth tax for the wealthiest individuals.And he's also talking about changing -- he said he wants to change shareholder capitalism.NAVARRO: Sure.BARTIROMO: What do you make of all of that?NAVARRO: Well, I think that's a good way of talking about what President Trump is going to do in his second term, because what President Trump is going to do is finish what he started.And the whole four points of the policy compass going back to the campaign was deregulation, cut taxes, dominate in energy, and have fair trade deals.And everything that Biden wants to do and is running on is directly opposite that, directly opposite to the direction of growing the economy. So, that's what the president is going to do.And we got to a point with this president, best jobs president in history, where he had the best economy in American history, in middle of January, we had the unemployment rate down for record lows for blacks, Hispanics, Asians, women.And we were cruising along, until the Chinese Communist Party basically hit us with that deadly virus, that weaponized virus. And I don't think it's any coincidence that the first year that China had a down economy was the same year now that they're coming after us in all sorts of ways.And Joe Biden is the candidate of the Chinese Communist Party. Trump, buy American, Joe Biden, buy China.BARTIROMO: All right.Let me ask you about China, because, of course, we saw now a pushback in terms of sanctions on individuals in China responsible for taking away Hong Kong freedoms. People are waiting for the president to sign that in terms of the sanctions on those individuals.Why should the U.S. be acting aggressively on Hong Kong?NAVARRO: Yes.BARTIROMO: Do you want to open borders for Hong Kong citizens to come to America? What's the plan?NAVARRO: For decades, the Chinese Communist Party used Hong Kong as a weapon to attack the American manufacturing base and vacuum jobs and capital back to the Chinese mainland.Do you know what, Maria? We put up with that, in support of a free and Democratic Hong Kong.BARTIROMO: Yes.NAVARRO: But now that China has taken away their economy, they have effectively turned it just into another concentration camp, like Xinjiang, Tibet, and the rest of the Chinese mainland, now that that has happened, President Trump, going back to a speech in the Rose Garden at the end of May, said, we're going to strip them of all preferential treatment, so that they can't harm American workers anymore, and we're going to punish those responsible.And so you can expect, early this week, the president to sign both the Hong Kong Autonomy Act and an executive order which will complete the process that the president started on May 29 in the Rose Garden. We cannot let Chinese Communist Party use Hong Kong anymore to attack the American economy.BARTIROMO: OK. Yes.NAVARRO: So that's coming.The other thing that's on the table that we need to talk about is this whole TikTok, WeChat social media thing.BARTIROMO: Yes.NAVARRO: Here is the thing, Maria.What the American people have to understand is, all the data that goes into those mobile apps that kids have so much fun with and seem so convenient, it goes right to servers in China, right to the Chinese military, the Chinese Communist Party, and the agencies which want to steal our intellectual property.Those apps can be used to steal personal and financial information for blackmail and extortion. They can be used to steal business intellectual property and proprietary secrets.The worst thing they use them for, besides surveilling and tracking Americans, the worst thing they do is engage in information warfare against the American people, against this president. The Chinese Communist Party wants Joe Biden more than anything right now, and the American people should not be subject to information warfare.The other thing about TikTok, for example, and WeChat...BARTIROMO: Yes.NAVARRO: ... even what -- this is really interesting. They're running the same playbook as Huawei, right? Put an American puppet in charge of Huawei as the CEO and say, hey, everything is going to be fine. We're going to be separate.They're trying that game with TikTok. Not going to work. TikTok is the biggest -- TikTok and WeChat are the biggest forms of censorship on the Chinese mainland. And so expect strong action on that. Expect action, action, action from this president on buy American, on China, on jobs.And this is the president that gets things done for the American people.BARTIROMO: Yes.You know, you mentioned the person running TikTok. It is actually extraordinary. This is -- this was the number two guy at Disney, Kevin Mayer, who is now the CEO of TikTok...NAVARRO: Yes.BARTIROMO: ... an American, but, obviously, the Chinese -- the Chinese individual...NAVARRO: Running dog puppet.BARTIROMO: ... who is a Communist member is the chairman.But this is what I thought was really interesting. This week, we had a headline that says Democratic National Committee is warning that campaign - - against campaigns on using TikTok.NAVARRO: Yes. Yes.BARTIROMO: Even the Democratic National Committee is voicing concern.NAVARRO: Yes.BARTIROMO: Amazon, of course, we know already banned TikTok from employee phones.NAVARRO: Actually, Maria, they didn't.BARTIROMO: So, you say these are data collectors?NAVARRO: Yes, Amazon actually...BARTIROMO: He said he was going to, Jeff Bezos.NAVARRO: Yes. Yes. They announced it, and then they backed away from it, which shows the power of the Chinese Communist Party on corporate America.And that's the problem. This guy who is running TikTok now, a Disney executive, who is more compromised than the Disney kingdom over in China? Because they want to sell all their Disney World tickets over there. They want to sell all their Disney content.And so what -- if TikTok, if it separates as an American company, that doesn't help us, because it's going to be worth -- we're going to have to give China billions of dollars for the privilege of having TikTok operate on U.S. soil.BARTIROMO: Well...NAVARRO: So, TikTok, WeChat and -- India banned 70 of these things. So TikTok and WeChat, I suspect that the president is just getting started with those two.BARTIROMO: Well, that's what I was just going to say, because India has banned TikTok. Is the president going to?NAVARRO: I never get ahead of the president, but we are looking very closely at this problem.BARTIROMO: OK.NAVARRO: And just run through the checklist.BARTIROMO: OK.NAVARRO: The information warfare, surveillance and tracking, stealing your data.No American -- the parents -- their kids are sitting there with TikTok. I mean, data right out of the household is going to the Chinese Communist Party.BARTIROMO: Yes.NAVARRO: What can go wrong there?BARTIROMO: Peter...NAVARRO: So, what we need to do -- jobs and China, that's what this campaign is about.(LAUGHTER)BARTIROMO: All right, we will be watching.Great to talk with you, as always, Peter. Thank you so much, Peter Navarro from the White House this morning.Coming up: Will John Durham complete his investigation into the origins of the Russia probe in time to impact the 2020 election?The ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee, Jim Jordan, will weigh in after this break.Stay with us.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BARTIROMO: Well, welcome back.Attorney General Bill Barr told me that the Russian collusion narrative was the closest the U.S. has ever come to a coup since the assassination of Abraham Lincoln.Yet, according to a new Rasmussen poll, most voters do not know there's evidence that Barack Obama and Joe Biden were even involved in it.A.G. Barr recently spoke to me about the status of John Durham's investigation on the FBI's probe into the Trump campaign.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)WILLIAM BARR, U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL: He's pressing ahead as hard as he can. And I expect that we will have some developments hopefully before the end of this summer.But, as I have said, his investigation will continue. It's not going to stop because of the election. What happens after the election may depend on who wins the election.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Congressman Jim Jordan is the ranking Republican on the House Judiciary Committee.Congressman, it's always a pleasure to see you. Thank you so much for joining us.REP. JIM JORDAN (R-OH): You bet. Good to be with you.BARTIROMO: Where are we on the John Durham investigation, sir? What do you know?JORDAN: Well, we know what Bill Barr has told us.Now, the attorney general will be in front of the Judiciary Committee in two weeks. I'm sure he will get asked about this and a number of other issues.But the attorney general has said that he expects something this summer. We're obviously -- we're hitting the summer, so let's hope it happens. Let's hope it happens before the election.I will tell you this, Maria. The number one question I get, whether I'm in the Fourth District of Ohio or traveling around our state or traveling around the country, the number one question I get from people is, they will walk up to me and says, when is somebody going to jail?And the reason they say that is because they're sick of the double standard, this idea that there's one set of rules for the politically connected in D.C. and a different set for us regular folks.So let's hope we have the investigation done before the election. Let's hope that someone is going to be held accountable for the major wrongdoing that took place when they targeted the president's campaign and spied on the president's campaign.BARTIROMO: Well, it's pretty extraordinary.And we know that there was always criminality done, whether it's leaking confidential information, or changing a document of evidence, which is -- one of the FBI agents already did that. They changed a document.JORDAN: Yes.BARTIROMO: Or maybe it was entrapment, lying to investigators.So, how come we haven't seen any charges yet? I mean, there are, what, 14 referrals of criminal charges already from you and your colleagues?JORDAN: Yes. I mean, who knows.But here is how bad it was. Michael Flynn, 38 different people 49 different times unmasked Michael Flynn's name between Election Day 2016 and Inauguration Day in January 2017. So, in that short two-month time period, 49 separate times, they were unmasking his name, even though they already knew, all these people already knew that there was no basis for the investigation to begin with.And how do we know that they knew there was no basis, there was no proper predicate? Because, when they testified, they told us that. Ric Grenell released the testimony of Comey and Clapper and Brennan and Rice and Samantha Power, released all of the testimony.And they all said the same thing: We never saw any evidence of any type of coordination, collusion, conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia. But they investigated it anyway, even up until the time when Bob Mueller was named special counsel.Jim Comey, when we deposed him in the House last Congress, when we deposed him, he said: After 10 months, we didn't have anything.But Comey does what? Leaks his memo, so we get two years of Bob Mueller, leaks his memos for the express purpose of getting a special counsel named. And then we had the 19 lawyers, 40 agents, 500 subpoenas, 2,800 or 500 witnesses, 2,800 subpoenas, and $30 million to tell us what we already knew, what they already knew, that there was nothing there.So let's hope that, ultimately, someone is held accountable.BARTIROMO: Do you think there will be indictments?JORDAN: I hope so. I mean, I have said this all along.I think Jim Comey is the biggest culprit here. It was the Comey cabal, this small handful of people at the top of the FBI. And then, remember, Bill Barr, the first time he testified, said there was a failure of leadership at the upper echelon of the FBIComey, McCabe, Baker, Strzok, Page, they all left or had to be fired as the key people...BARTIROMO: Yes.JORDAN: ... who ran the Clinton investigation and the Trump-Russia investigation.Comey is the ringleader here. I hope they give him a second look. And I hope he's ultimately held accountable.BARTIROMO: Let me ask you.Let me switch gears, ask you about your committee, the Judiciary Committee's closed-door testimony of Geoffrey Berman. I have in front of me your takeaways from the committee's transcribed interview with Berman.Nadler says that Barr dealings with Berman often came close to bribery. Your reaction? And tell us what you can about that closed-door hearing.JORDAN: Well, first of all, Mr. Nadler's statement is ridiculous.When we deposed Mr. Berman, he said very clearly -- we asked him about his meeting with Bill Barr on June 19 in New York. We said, did you talk about any cases? No. Did you talk about any suspects? No. Did you talk about any witnesses to any cases? No. Did you talk about the president? No,.There was nothing there. The attorney general and the president of the United States are entitled to have the people they want as U.S. attorneys around the country. That's all this was.The Democrats, because they don't like the fact that Bill Barr is trying to get to the bottom of what took place in the previous Justice Department, the Obama-Biden-Comey Justice Department, because they don't like the fact that he's trying to clean up the politics that existed in the previous administration, they continue to go after him, so much so that they filed articles of impeachment against the attorney general just a week-and-a-half ago.BARTIROMO: Yes.JORDAN: That's how ridiculous the Democrats are.BARTIROMO: Congressman, I have got to ask you about tech tyranny and the upcoming hearings that you're going to have in Judiciary.We will hear from people like Apple's CEO, Google's CEO, Facebook, Twitter in a hearing on July 25 or 28. Tell me about your letter to Jack Dorsey about the president's tweets and what you're expecting out of technology, big tech.Are they going to try to sway the election in November?JORDAN: Well, Maria, I always start with this simple question. Why is does always seem that it's just conservatives who get censored or shadowbanned by these big tech companies?Why was it two years ago that there are 435 members of the House, there are 100 members of the Senate, 535, but only four were shadowbanned, Gaetz, Meadows, Nunes, Jordan?Interesting four. I always say -- when we send a letter to Jack Dorsey, when we brought this to his attention, he indicated that, oh, it was just a glitch in our algorithm, to which I responded, glitch in your algorithm? What did you put in the algorithm, the names Gaetz, Meadows, Nunes, Jordan?I mean, it's always conservatives.(LAUGHTER)JORDAN: Why is it only the president -- why is it only the president who gets censored? You never see them going after Joe Biden.Why is it just -- why was it The Federalist that Google tried to demonetize?BARTIROMO: Yes.JORDAN: You never see a liberal news outlet trying to be demonetized.So, that, to me, is the fundamental question. And that has got to change, because, in America today, if only one side is allowed to talk, that's not the First Amendment. You got to have a real debate. And this cancel culture mob and the impact they have on these big tech companies is a scary road we're traveling down.And it needs to stop. And that's what we're going to focus on as Republicans in these hearings.BARTIROMO: Congressman, it's great to have you this morning.We will be watching, certainly, closely. It's so wonderful to get your take on all of this, Congressman Jim Jordan.Coming up, Rudy Giuliani is here on the Supreme Court decision that President Trump should turn over his tax returns.That's coming up next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BARTIROMO: The Supreme Court making headlines on Thursday, ruling that President Trump's financial and tax records are fair game for New York prosecutors.The president since calling decision not fair. But is it really the slam- dunk victory his critics were hoping for?Joining me right now is former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, who also served as the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York for six years.And, Rudy, it's always a pleasure to see you. Thank you so much for joining us.RUDY GIULIANI (R), FORMER MAYOR OF NEW YORK: Always a pleasure, Maria, yes, absolutely.BARTIROMO: So...GIULIANI: So, that case is really terribly decided.But go ahead.BARTIROMO: No, about the tax returns.GIULIANI: Oh.BARTIROMO: Are you going -- are you going to be responding in any way? Will the tax releases have any bearing on the election, in your view?GIULIANI: Well, first of all, there's still room for opposition.You could make the argument that they have no particularized need for it. You could also make the argument that they are not investigating any particularized crime.They have no reason to believe that there's anything wrong with his tax returns. I mean, all these tax returns have been, by and large -- maybe not the last one -- but all of them have been audited. All of them have been either passed on or settled.And there should be something in your tax returns. In other words, we get audited, we make a deal, we pay the government, you don't come after me forever for that.And, also, this is the president of the United States. There are literally 400 -- 4,000 prosecutors who can now come after his records. I don't think the court ever thought of that.So there may be a chance to revisit this. The burden this would place on the executive, like, if you had an opposition party -- and look at the DAs we have now. We have Soros-elected anarchist DAs. They're not there to prosecute the law. They are there to undermine the law.He put them there. Why would Soros pay for DAs, other than to undermine our government?BARTIROMO: Wow.GIULIANI: He got people elected who release criminals, don't prosecute cases. In Philadelphia, they won't even bring a case to the DA, he's so anti-police, pro-criminal.Five years, Soros has been funding these. And nobody paid attention to it. But he had a reason. It's to undermine our government. And I think we have a chance to revisit this.Also, we can argue that they have no need for it. This is a fishing expedition. I mean, I think we fight them right down to the wire.BARTIROMO: Let me ask you about what's happening to our cities, Rudy.You oversaw New York City becoming the safest city on your leadership because of the moves you made. Look at New York City right now, shootings soaring to 205 percent. What will it take to get this city back with law and order? Shooting incidences up 130 percent, murder up 23 percent, burglary up 118 percent.What is your reaction to Mayor de Blasio's new plan, he says, to take back the blocks, relying heavily on community members on the streets?GIULIANI: Well, I mean, the reality is, he's already amended that plan, because it was -- I mean, it's stupid throughout, but he was going to have community leaders accompany the police, until, last night, he had another night of violence that was unreal.So now the community leaders are not going to accompany the police. I think they got an idea, hey, Mayor, you go with them. Maybe we don't want to go, because they shoot at us. We had a terrible situation with a domestic violence thing last night.I mean, it's a disaster, Maria. I have never seen it like this. I mean, there were more murders in the city under Dinkins, 2,400, 2,200, but we never had this total disrespect for the police. Even in those bad old days, nobody was going to spit at a police officer, nobody was going to punch a police officer.And they took advantage of the no choke hold last night in an incident that I have a videotape of, where the police officer couldn't get ahold of him. The guy put a choke hold on the cop and almost killed him, and he couldn't defend himself.BARTIROMO: Oh, my God.GIULIANI: I mean, we're going to get a cop killed with that stupid no choke hold thing, the way it's interpreted.We're getting cops killed. And the reaction -- the reality is, it's worse because this is a breakdown in general respect for the police, for our government, and hatred for our country.And there's a purpose to it. These people are Marxists. They want to take over our government. When are we going to wake up and realize that? Just go read what they write.BARTIROMO: Well...GIULIANI: Look at the fact that the woman who is taking in the money for the BLM is a convicted terrorist who should be in jail for 58 years, except crooked Clinton pardoned her, a terrorist who was involved in police killings.She is handling the money for the Black Lives Matter. This is a woman dedicated to the overthrow of our government.BARTIROMO: And, look, Mayor de Blasio obviously cut the budget for the NYPD by a billion dollars.You said the last time you were with me that Governor Cuomo can replace Mayor de Blasio. How come he hasn't done it yet then? The New York A.G. is recommending de Blasio should no longer have the authority in New York enforcement matters. Is that enough?GIULIANI: Well, you know, I will give him the citation.It's Article 1, Section 9 of the New York City charter, which I pretty much have memorized. It says that the governor can remove the mayor. You don't even have to have cause. Now precedent would say it would have to be corruption, like they attempted to remove Jimmy Walker, but he resigned.Or it could be gross incompetence. Or it could be putting the lives of New Yorkers in jeopardy. Bill de Blasio, through his incompetence, has killed New Yorkers. His negligence in dealing with COVID is outrageous, the things he didn't do and the things that he encouraged.BARTIROMO: Yes.GIULIANI: They criticize President Trump for being late. He was telling people to go to gyms two weeks into it, two weeks after the president made it clear, this is very dangerous.BARTIROMO: Wow.It certainly feels like a different city today, I will tell you. You just don't feel safe in New York City.I want to switch gears. You were the A.G. for the Southern District of New York from 1983 to 1989, where Ghislaine Maxwell is now being indicted. Reaction to the charges. Do you think she's going to name names? What's your reaction to this Jeffrey Epstein-Ghislaine Maxwell situation?GIULIANI: Well, I don't know all the people there now, but the person in charge, Audrey Strauss, was a colleague of mine. And she's a very, very -- she's a very good lawyer and a very honest and down-the-middle-kind of prosecutor.I can only guess what Maxwell has. And it sounds like she's got tapes, and it would not make sense if they didn't. I mean, they were pretty smart people. They have been protected for a long time. There must be a reason for that. They must have a lot of things on a lot of people. And it's going to be really interesting to see.BARTIROMO: Yes.GIULIANI: You can't argue with a tape. You can't argue. There's got to be a lot of people very scared over the last couple of days.And I'd like to keep her alive, guys. I mean, you know, she is in a prison.BARTIROMO: Yes.GIULIANI: You can keep somebody alive in a prison.BARTIROMO: All right.GIULIANI: And if they need any help, if they need any help on how to keep somebody alive in a prison, I used to also run the Bureau of Prisons. I think I could show them.BARTIROMO: All right, Rudy, it's great to see you this morning.Thanks very much for joining us.(LAUGHTER)BARTIROMO: Great to see you.GIULIANI: You know you're the best.(LAUGHTER)BARTIROMO: Coming up next: Donald Trump Jr. is here with his reaction to the Black Lives Matter mural in New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio helped paint right outside of Trump Tower this week, where he works every day.We are going to get his reaction when we come back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BARTIROMO: Welcome back.New photographs this morning of President Trump wearing a mask publicly for the first time yesterday during his visit to Walter Reed Hospital.The president, who met with wounded soldiers and medical workers, told reporters he loves masks in the appropriate locations, but still believes they have a time and place.Joining us right now with reaction is the executive vice president of the Trump Organization, Donald Trump Jr.And, Don, it is good to see you this morning. Thanks very much for joining us.DONALD TRUMP JR., EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT, TRUMP ORGANIZATION: It's my pleasure, Maria. How are you?BARTIROMO: Yes, great.Interesting to see your dad donning a mask. Obviously, things are serious. You have got the potential of a second spike.How is Kimberly doing? We know that Kimberly has contracted COVID, along with a top convention person. Is she OK?TRUMP JR.: She's 100 percent fine.She's -- zero symptoms, zero anything. We're in quarantine, obviously, and I am too because of proximity. But, other than that, you really wouldn't know that there's anything even going on.So, it's been good. I -- under the circumstances, it's as good as it can get.And I also saw my father looked pretty good in the mask the other day.(LAUGHTER)TRUMP JR.: And I think what people also have to realize, when he talks about there being a time and place, anyone who comes into proximity with him is literally tested that day, is literally tested moments before they allow access.So he's obviously going to be much less susceptible to this than anyone else, because, literally, there is a daily screening process if you're going to even be within proximity to him.So I think that's important for people to note. But when he's going to Walter Reed to visit our sick and our wounded soldiers, he's going to take that very seriously.BARTIROMO: Yes, but people are taking seriously the idea that we are seeing a second wave potentially, and spikes in some hot spots across the country.What does that mean for the convention, Don? And what about the idea that, look, the Democrats have already said they're going to do a virtual convention? There are polls that have Biden either tied with Trump or actually leading Donald Trump.Your thoughts of all of these worries going into the convention and then, of course, the election?TRUMP JR.: Well, I think, for the Democrats, of course they want to do a virtual convention, because there's no enthusiasm for Joe Biden. He can't get people to show up a rally, if he was able to do rallies.So this whole scenario is really the ultimate best-case scenario for Joe Biden and his campaign. They don't want him on the stump. They don't want him speaking to reporters. They don't want him ad-libbed. Honestly, they don't even want him on a teleprompter, because he can't even get that right.So, for them, it's sort of the ultimate. I think, with our convention, there's a lot of people that want to do it. They want to be enthusiastic. But we can do that and we can do it safely. We can take the necessary precautions. We can protect the people that are going to be there. We can implement things that you wouldn't necessarily normally implement at a convention to do so.So, they're going to take it very seriously. We're going to do a great job with it, and it's going to be an awesome event.BARTIROMO: What does the president need to get these numbers up? Are you buying these polls? It looks like one after the next. It is a real tight race. And, in many cases, Biden is leading the president.TRUMP JR.: Well, listen, I think, when you have the media onslaught, where a media has just totally abdicated their position to objectively look at both sides, they're not looking into any of Biden's past.They're not looking into any of his history. They're not looking into his family's graft. They're not looking into how insanely soft he's been on China throughout his entire career. And let's not forget, this is a 50-year career in Washington, D.C.They're trying to run him like he's a moderate outsider. This guy is the epitome of the swamp. So they want to do whatever they can to keep the American people from actually seeing Biden.He hasn't been defined. And the media is trying to make sure that no one gets to define Joe Biden, because, once he is, you will see how terrible this notion could be for America.BARTIROMO: Which is why you're out with a upcoming book, \"Liberal Privilege.\"You're going to talk a lot about Biden in this book, right? You're self- publishing a book? When is it coming out, Don?TRUMP JR.: A hundred percent.I guess one of offshoots, one of the only positive things of quarantine for the last few months was, I had a lot of free time. And I was looking into it, and actually went on and hired a researcher just to do it myself, because I said, if the media is going to totally neglect this guy, this history, these terrible trade deals, especially now, in the post-COVID-19 world, where we are going to actually have to deal with China and deal tough with China, which is what Donald Trump's -- that's his wheelhouse.That's his forte. He's the only guy to do it in the modern American history. That Joe Biden can sell this notion of, well, now we're going to be buy American, after 50 years of legislation that sent our jobs, that sent our American dream to China, it's asinine.But I'm sitting there looking, whether it's Hunter Biden, whether it's Joe's brother, whether it's the sister -- the entire family has enriched themselves off of Joe Biden's publicly funded office.He won't release his documents from 30-something years in the Senate that are sitting at the University of Delaware. These aren't like private notes that he had as a citizen. This is while he was a senator in the United States, paid for by the American taxpayer, and, somehow, that's magically off-limits?Brett Kavanaugh's high school yearbook was not off-limits, according to Democrats.BARTIROMO: Yes.TRUMP JR.: His high school yearbook.But Joe Biden's Senate papers, no, no, no, we can't touch this.BARTIROMO: Yes. Yes.TRUMP JR.: so, it's about hypocrisy. It's about the double standard.And I called it \"Liberal Privilege,\" because we hear a lot about privilege these days, but liberal privilege is the ultimate...BARTIROMO: Yes.TRUMP JR.: ... because they can say one thing, do the other, and never get called on it.BARTIROMO: Hmm.Well, look, in the meantime, the critics of your father continue stepping it up. Just in the last two weeks, you had the mayor of New York actually painting a Black Lives Matter mural right outside of Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue in New York City.This is where you work every day, right?TRUMP JR.: I...BARTIROMO: Do you pass this new mural here? Here is the shots of the mayor actually painting it right outside of Trump Tower.Your reaction?TRUMP JR.: Well, listen, it would be nice if the mayor actually did something to help the people of his city.He's busy there playing arts and crafts, but what has he actually done, other than oversee the destruction of New York City? The guy is -- it's literally gross incompetence, but he will go there for a photo op.What happened to the billion dollars, almost a billion dollars that were literally just lost on him and his wife's pet projects in New York City? Now he wants to defund the police, take $1 billion out of New York City's police department's budget.What do you think is going to happen with that? You see police officers retiring in droves. You want to stop senseless killings, like George Floyd? Guess what. The answer is not driving experienced, dedicated, loyal police officers into early retirement, and filling those -- that void with inexperienced people who may not have qualified otherwise, but are only getting the job because you need someone there.The guy doesn't know what he's doing. It's gross negligence. And, honestly, it's worse. It's just sheer incompetence. But, again, he can play arts and crafts for the photo-op, and it's as though all of the things and all of his failures are totally forgotten. But the media will give him that benefit of the doubt.BARTIROMO: Yes, but it's going -- it's going to keep going.And, in fact, de Blasio, Hillary Clinton, they all want mail-in voting. I want to talk to you about the, at because there was a city councilman among four people facing voter fraud charges in New Jersey.We have got umpteen stories of this delusion, mail-in ballots forcing election officials in New York, Pennsylvania, Kentucky to take two times as long to count votes in primary elections.How much of this election is going to be mail-in voting, do you think, Don?TRUMP JR.: Well, the Democrats would like it all to be mail-in voting. You have seen that.How often have Republicans won after the fact when people show up? Oh, look, magically I found a bucket of ballots in my car, they're all Democrats, four days later.BARTIROMO: Yes.TRUMP JR.: It's truly disgusting.Over the weekend, we saw a cat, a cat that has been dead for 12 years, since the end of the Bush administration, got a voter regulation form in its home in Atlanta.BARTIROMO: Oh, my goodness.TRUMP JR.: This is what's going on.A mail -- a mail clerk, someone who worked for the U.S. Postal Service...BARTIROMO: Yes.TRUMP JR.: ... pleaded guilty over the weekend for altering ballots.You think the Democrats aren't going to take full advantage of this? They are running around bragging that they were able to manipulate Trump rallies on TikTok.BARTIROMO: This is -- this is...TRUMP JR.: But they are not going to take advantage of mail-in voting.Democrats have even said it's terrible. But now, when it seems to...(CROSSTALK)TRUMP JR.: ... work against Trump, it's over.BARTIROMO: Yes. This is really serious stuff going into the election. You're right.All right, real quick, final question here, Don. Will you run for the mayor of New York?(LAUGHTER)TRUMP JR.: No.My only focus right now is making sure that my father wins in 2020. I see the policies that he's done. I see the economic results. We have seen it in the job numbers.Donald Trump did the impossible. Donald Trump accomplished the Holy Grail of American politics, raising the job numbers for people, raising the minimum wages for the lowest-income earners, watching their wages go up for the first time in modern history.Donald Trump did it all before. He's the guy that can do it again, clearly not swamp creature Joe Biden, who has an accomplishment record that is nonexistent in 50 years in Washington, D.C.BARTIROMO: So, maybe you will consider it after the president wins, then, Mayor of New York Donald Trump Jr.TRUMP JR.: I don't know. That's not really my kind of job, but who knows.BARTIROMO: All right, good to see you, Don.Thanks very much for being here.We will be right back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BARTIROMO: Welcome back.On July 20, Congress will return to Washington, with just one objective, hammering out the next stimulus bill.The bipartisan talks happening just as the extra $600 in weekly unemployment benefits is set to expire at the end of the month.Joining me right now is Republican Conference Chairman Senator John Barrasso.And, Senator, it's always a pleasure to see you. Thank you so much for joining us.SEN. JOHN BARRASSO, R-WYO.: Thank you, Maria.BARTIROMO: Tell me what the plans are in terms of the CARES Act or the next part of the CARES Act, another stimulus plan.BARRASSO: Yes, there's a consensus we need to do another bill. That will be in the next couple of weeks.And let me just tell you what I believe needs to be in it. And I think your viewers will agree.Number one, it has to focus on getting people back to work and children back in school.Number two, it has to focus on saving lives. And, to me, that means more testing, better treatment, and then, of course, a vaccine. And, finally, we need to provide the liability insurance for our health care workers, for our mom-and-pop small businesses, and for our schools, so they can all open in a good way.Now, the Democrats have a proposal already. They passed it a month or so ago. And it's Nancy Pelosi living in handout heaven. It's direct checks to illegal immigrants. It's bailouts to big city and state pension plans that are run by Democrats.We're not going to do that. The focus of this bill has to be getting people back to work and paychecks back into their pockets.BARTIROMO: So, you're back on July 20, but then there's another recess beginning on August 8, right?Do you think, in that three-week period, you're going to get another stimulus plan passed and signed before you leave again August 8?BARRASSO: Well, there are a couple of deadlines, as you mentioned.One is the enhanced uninsured -- unemployment insurance benefits that run out on July 31. The other is the Paycheck Protection Program, which has been so successful. That runs out on August 8. That's helped keep about 50 million people on their -- on a payroll. And, in Wyoming, we had 13,000 of those loans.So, yes, there's an urgency to get this done, a lot of different things in the components of it. The question is, should it include additional relief checks for people who have still not been able to get back to work, certainly in hard-hit industries, whether it's the service industry, the hospitality industry?BARTIROMO: I see.BARRASSO: You know, we did that once before, but that was at people up to $95,000. We're looking at a lower number there.BARTIROMO: OK.BARRASSO: And then the unemployment insurance, as you raised, these are enhanced benefits, where they have been paying people $600 a week above their own state unemployment benefits.BARTIROMO: To make -- right.(LAUGHTER)BARTIROMO: And some of them are making more to stay home, rather than to go to work.Stay with us, Senator. I want to ask you about masks and whether it should be a policy in that next act as well.We're talking with Senator Barrasso. We will be right back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BARTIROMO: Welcome back.And we are back with Senator John Barrasso.And, Senator, I want to ask you about masks and whether or not that should be part of your CARES Act. There are some states that have made wearing a mask a policy. Should it be a national policy?BARRASSO: Well, let me just say, Maria, as a doctor, I want to congratulate President Trump for wearing his mask yesterday in public for the world to see. I think that sends a very strong message to everyone.We know that masks lower the risk of infection. We know it lowers the risk of death. And in this recent uptick, I just think it's even more important than ever.And when it comes to opening schools, these are going to be local decisions, state decisions. But I just think, in terms of good planning and good health, as people try to resume their normal lives, masks, personal hygiene, washing their hands, socially distancing, that's all part of this as we continue to fight this disease.BARTIROMO: All right.And real quick, on the next CARES Act, when you get back on the 20th, it doesn't sound like you're going to leave on August 8 without anything getting done. Should I assume we will have another -- another stimulus package in that three week period?BARRASSO: There is general agreement we need to work to that end, and we need to deal with the issues affecting our nation.There are still people who can't go back to work, through no fault of their own, because of the disease, because of maybe medical conditions.BARTIROMO: Right.BARRASSO: We need to make sure that they are cared for.But we cannot continue to pay people more to sit at home than to go to work. And we have so many help wanted signs around Wyoming and the country.BARTIROMO: Yes.BARRASSO: We need to do all we can to get people back to work and help them earn that paycheckBARTIROMO: Senator, real quick, before we go.The Senate unanimously passed that bipartisan bill to sanction Chinese officials who threaten Hong Kong's authority, but the president hasn't signed it yet, right? What message does this send to the Communist Party? And will we see this get signed into law, do you think?BARRASSO: Well the communist Chinese are not our friends. There is no question about it.My message to the Chinese is, never again. Never again will we, as Americans, be dependent upon you, the communist Chinese, for medicines, for materials, for minerals.BARTIROMO: I see.BARRASSO: But what you're seeing here with what they're doing, Maria, with this group, with Hong Kong...BARTIROMO: Yes.BARRASSO: ... with their -- the Chinese incursion into the South China Sea, it's all a part of their big plan to the -- to be the military, the economic and the technological superpower of the world.BARTIROMO: I know.BARRASSO: We cannot allow it.BARTIROMO: Thanks.

Breaking tonight, the fight over getting back to school as schools come to the crucial decision about what will happen in just a few weeks. The president's press secretary said today children should go back to school this fall even if future studies find they are transmitting the coronavirus with of course proper mitigation efforts by the schools. The U.S. is now approaching 150,000 deaths and yesterday eclipse the four million cases mark. The World Health Organization reports global deaths rose by almost 9,800 in 24 hours, the largest single day increase since late April. And the number of cases rose by a record of almost 300,000 in one day. A new poll meantime finds nearly half of Americans who family -- whose families have experienced a layoff during this pandemic now believe those jobs are lost for good. All of this occurs as the president signs an executive order to get drug prices down. Correspondent Kevin Corke starts us off tonight live on the North Lawn of the White House. Good evening, Kevin. KEVIN CORKE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Good evening, Bret. We're going to learn a lot more on Monday about what the GOP plans to do to get more money into the hands of tens of millions of Americans that need more stimulus money to get over to them, that is clearly on top of mind for a lot of people. But as you pointed today, late this afternoon, the president made new headlines by once again wading into the prescription drug battle, this time hoping to save Americans a lot of money. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) CORKE: By Signing a series of executive orders late this afternoon, President Trump today promised to slash drug prices across the country. DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: This is an incredible day. This is just a big day; this is a big day. I've been waiting for this day for a long time. CORKE: The order is open up America to more important, cheaper drugs, directs drug maker rebates directly to patients, provides insulin and EpiPens at a very steep discount to low income people. And allows the use of lower international prices to pay for some Medicare drugs. The order fulfills a pledge he made to voters as a candidate back in 2016 and could well help him in 2020. The signings come with time running out for many out of work Americans whose lives could dramatically change after Saturday. That's when the extra $600 in weekly unemployment benefits from the federal government, pandemic unemployment compensation ends. KAYLEIGH MCENANY, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: We feel that it's very important from the White House to address unemployment insurance in particular and in also money for schools and ensuring that the money for schools enable students to make school choices like actually going to a physically open school. CORKE: The president, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnel do appear to be on agreement on one thing, and yes, there should be another round of $1,200 direct payments to Americans in need at a cost approaching $300 billion. As for the White House suggestion that perhaps unemployment insurance be funded separately, well, Speaker Pelosi has a clear message. REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA): It's a tactic in order not to honor our other responsibility. This is deadly serious. A house is burning down in terms of the economic security of America's families and these people are settling wherever they may be this weekend. CORKE: Still, getting Americans and their businesses back to work and school-age children back in the classroom remains the priority for this White House. A goal thwarted by rising COVID-19 cases. And in some parts of the country, a spike in fatalities attributed to the virus. DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES: Right now, I think if you look at what's going on in some of the southern states particularly, they're having the resurging of cases, you can put a pause on what you're doing or even maybe take a step back. But I think we can probably get around what we're doing now and put a lid on it and stop the surging by just being a bit more caution. (END VIDEOTAPE) CORKE: The CDC meanwhile is issuing a full protocol to get kids back in the classroom this coming fall, Bret. In fact, if you go to the website, you'll see a resources and tools section which basically extols the virtue of getting in person learning back in going to -- back in front of the kids, Bret. BAIER: Kevin Corke live in the North Lawn. Kevin, thanks. The violence during protest turned to riots in Portland is escalated. Last night, 2,000 people gathered to demonstrate against police brutality and racial injustice, but that soon deteriorated into another assault on the federal courthouse there. National correspondent William La Jeunesse has the latest on now 57 consecutive nights of protest. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: So they are definitely not being discriminatory about what they shoot at you. All they care is that it hits you and that hurts. WILLIAM LA JEUNESSE, FOX NEWS NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: What began as a stand against racism has become a nightly ritual outside the federal courthouse in Portland. The president showed a force 100 federal agents. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: If they're going to be violent, we have to match them. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's definitely a lot more aggressive like, -- I wouldn't call it peaceful. LA JEUNESSE: 2,000 gathered peacefully Thursday evening holding hands and blocking traffic but as night fell, a younger crowd set fires inside a fence erected to protect the building. Agents warned protesters multiple times to back away from the fence, they refused. After several breached the perimeter, agents fired teargas and foam pellets. CHAD WOLF, ACTING SECRETARY, HOMELAND SECURITY: We are targeting individuals that are doing these criminal acts and we're trying to hold them accountable. LA JEUNESSE: The feds charged 18 this week for assault, arson, and destroying federal poverty. In Seattle, an additional 100 federal agents are on standby in advance of a solidarity demonstration plan for Saturday. Police erected walls around two police stations out of fear they cannot protect them as the city council, and now a federal judge say cops cannot use pepper spray, teargas, or nonlethal munitions in crowd control. CARMEN BEST, CHIEF OF POLICE, SEATTLE POLICE DEPARTMENT: Now that we don't have any tools in our tool belt to protect the officers as we did before, that we have some protection around each of the facilities. LA JEUNESSE: Meanwhile, Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan says she will take every legal step necessary to stop federal agents from deploying as a quote, occupying force. JENNY DURKAN (D), MAYOR OF SEATTLE: I don't trust this president. I trust him to say what he does when it comes down to conflict, but we've got to prepare for any scenario and that's what we're trying to do. (END VIDEOTAPE) LA JEUNESSE: The DOJ inspector general agreed to review agent's use of force in Portland, in Seattle. Chief Best hope police not to risk their personal safety during protests since they are limited to their gun and riot baton, Bret. BAIER: William, thank you. More historical symbols came down today. Two statues of Christopher Columbus that stood in Chicago parks were removed at the direction of Democrat Mayor Lori Lightfoot. Virginia has taken down its iconic busts and statues, honoring Confederate generals and officials that includes a bronze statue of general Robert E. Lee positioned in the same spot where he stood to assume command of the state's armed forces in the Civil War nearly 160 years ago. The Minneapolis City Council is taking police media duties away from the Police Department. The city communications staff will now take over. Some on the council object as do some local journalists who raised concerns the change would decrease access to timely information. In tonight's Democracy 2020 report, we look at President Trump's shifting campaign strategy in recent days. The president has of course advocated for face coverings. He's canceled the Florida component of the Republican Convention. This occurs as the president continues to trail Joe Biden in national and battleground state polls. Correspondent Peter Doocy tells us where things stand tonight. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PETER DOOCY, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Trump 2020 looked different in April. TRUMP: Hopefully in a not-too-distant future, we'll have some massive rallies. DOOCY: But it does in July. TRUMP: We're going to do some other things with tele-rallies and online. DOOCY: The transition away from Trump's trademark rallies and planned in- person convention comes days after the president installed a new campaign manager Bill Stepien who told Fox on a Zoom call today, he believes Trump can flip Minnesota while arguing Trump can win the electoral college even if he only wins one of these three states Pennsylvania, Wisconsin or Michigan. As the campaign broadly argues polls don't measure support like enthusiasm. HOGAN GIDLEY, TRUMP 2020 NATIONAL PRESS SECRETARY: Our supporters wills stand through rain, sleet, snow, hail and crawl across broken glass to vote for Donald Trump. Joe Biden supporters won't even click on a link to watch and do a Q&A. DOOCY: Joe Biden is nearing his target date for an aiming a running mate August 1st and in a twist, one contender is defending another. Congresswoman Karen Bass condemned a political report, calling her the anti-Kamala. Tweeting, I would never want to be labeled the anti-Kamala Harris. We're fortunate to have had her as attorney general and now as senator, she would be an excellent V.P. and the same goes for anyone else on the list. The former V.P. Biden is also now taking heat for this comment about President Trump. JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We've had racists and they've exist and they've tried to get elected president. He's the first one that has. DOOCY: The influential \"Breakfast Club\" host Charlamagne Tha God says, that goes to show, Biden doesn't recognize the faults of other white male leaders. CHARLAMAGNE THA GOD, RADIO HOST, THE BREAKFAST CLUB: I really wish Joe Biden would shut the F up forever and continue to act like he's starring in the movie \"A Quiet Place\" because as soon as he opens his mouth and makes noise, he gets us all killed. (END VIDEOTAPE) DOOCY: Trump's new campaign manager also signaled a new theme lies ahead because even though Biden has been around a long time, they think he's largely undefined to most Americans, so they'll try to do that, reminding voters in industrial states about things like Biden's vote for NAFTA, Bret. BAIER: More on this with the panel. Peter, thank you. Tonight, we have potentially groundbreaking new information about the FBI personnel involved in the investigation into the 2016 Trump presidential campaign. Correspondent Doug McKelway tells us this evening things were not as they seemed. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DOUG MCKELWAY, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: The White House believes the declassified document released by director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe appears to further implicate top FBI officials and in apparent attempt to surreptitiously dig up dirt on then candidate Donald Trump under the guise of briefing him. TRUMP: This is illegal as can be, this is treason. MCKELWAY: The document shows that on August 17th, 2016, then candidate Trump, General Michael Flynn and former New York Governor Chris Christie, attended a 15-minute long defensive briefing by FBI agent Joe Pientka at the FBI's New York Field Office. Pientka's typewritten notes showed Trump asked, Joe, are the Russians bad because they have more numbers? Are they worse than the Chinese? Pientka responds, both countries are bad. During a discussion on Russia and China cheating on a Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty, Trump asked, who's worse? Someone then responds, they are both bad but Russia is worse. Trump and Christie turned towards each other and Christie comments with apparent sarcasm, I'm shocked. Later, Agent Pientka turns the case file over to the FBI's head of counter espionage Peter Strzok and FBI lawyer Kevin Kleinsmith who has admitted falsifying a FISA application to spy on the Trump campaign. It remains unclear whether Agent Pientka was told before briefing Trump whether to seek damaging information on him. Congressional Democrats have defended the FBI saying, it would have been negligent not to launch an investigation into the Trump campaign's alleged ties to Russia. Trump supporters disagree. K.T. MCFARLAND, FORMER DEPUTY NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER: This is not anonymous sources leaking, these are actual documents, pieces of paper, text messages, e-mails. (END VIDEOTAPE) MCKELWAY: The release of the document may mean that the Justice Department is done with it and that U.S. Attorney John Durham could be close to wrapping up his investigation of the FBI's spying on the Trump campaign, Bret. BAIER: Doug McKelway, outside of the DOJ. Doug, thanks. The Beijing government is ordering the U.S. to close one of its consulates in China. The move is retaliation for a similar order by the Trump administration regarding China's consulate in Houston, called a den of spies by administration officials and lawmakers. Tonight, Lucas Tomlinson at the Pentagon looks at the rapidly deteriorating relationship between the two nations. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) LUCAS TOMLINSON, FOX NEWS PENTAGON CORRESPONDENT: The Trump administration reacting after the Chinese Communist Party gives a U.S. Consulate in Western China 72 hours to close down. MCENANY: We urge the CCP to cease these malign actions rather than engage in retaliations. TOMLINSON: Beijing returned the favor two days after U.S. kick China out of its consulate in Houston with the same 72-hour deadline. The Justice Department taking actions on more spies they say are working for Communist China. A scientist from the University of California Davis is now in custody after hiding out in the Chinese consulate in San Francisco. Speaking at the Nixon Library, nearly 50 years after the 37th president's historic visit to Beijing, President Trump's Secretary of State said confronting China is the, quote, mission of our time. MIKE POMPEO, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: China ripped off our prized intellectual property and trade secrets causing millions of jobs all across America. It sucked supply chains away from America. President Nixon once said, he feared he had created a Frankenstein by opening the world to the CCP and here we are. WANG WENBIN, CHINESE FOREIGN MINISTRY (through translator): Pompeo's speech disregarded facts and confuse the right and wrong. TOMLINSON: The relationship between Beijing and Washington has showered in recent years. TRUMP: President Xi, he's a friend of mine, but he likes China, I like the USA. TOMLINSON: Earlier this month, two U.S. Navy aircraft carriers Ronald Reagan and Nimitz sailed together in the South China Sea to send a message to Beijing. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We're not going to be stopped by anybody. (END VIDEOTAPE) TOMLINSON: After record-setting six months at sea without a port call, the U.S. has (INAUDIBLE) finally heading home from the Middle East. Now the Nimitz has arrived, Bret. BAIER: Lucas Tomlinson at the Pentagon. Lucas, thanks. Stocks were down as tensions flare again between the U.S. and China. The Dow lost 182 today, the S&P 500 fell 20, the NASDAQ dropped 98.

Lewis's body will lie in state in the Alabama State Capitol, to Georgia State Capitol, and the U.S. Capitol. The 80-year-old Lewis died last Friday, several months after being diagnosed with advanced pancreatic cancer. The Washington Post has settled the defamation lawsuit launched by a Kentucky high school student over its coverage of a confrontation with the Native Americans in the nation's capital last year. Nicholas Sandmann has already reached a settlement with CNN and is still pursuing action against several other outlets. Many media wrongly portrayed the Kentucky teen as the aggressor during that incident. Additional video evidence later showed that was not true. Michigan State University has suspended workouts and ordered all members of its football team to quarantine for two weeks. The team stopped practice Wednesday after a second staff member and one student-athlete tested positive for coronavirus. Just one issue as we look at how some colleges and universities are planning to deal with the fall semester in light of where we are with the coronavirus pandemic. Correspondent Molly Line, reports tonight from Boston. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MOLLY LINE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: With the fall looming, the nation's institutions of higher learning are making plans to welcome students back. But how to keep them safe and protect faculty and staff in the age of COVID-19 is a staggering challenge. And the solutions are as varied as the universities implementing them. One of the nation's most prestigious universities, Harvard, has announced all classes will be online. Mary Duvnjak is a rising junior from Long Island. MARY DUVNJAK, STUDENT, HARVARD UNIVERSITY: I'm considering taking the fall semester off because after experiencing the virtual spring, I really feel like I missed out on a very important aspects of the Harvard education, which is the Harvard experience. LINE: Nearby Boston University is planning a return to campus, but -- JEAN MORRISON, PROVOST, BOSTON UNIVERSITY: The experience that the students will have will not be the experiences as usual. LINE: Masks will be required, dorm capacity reduced, and a robust COVID-19 testing program launched. Students will have a choice to attend classes in person or remotely. MORRISON: We had made an investment in technology to provide that capability in classrooms that didn't previously have it. LINE: The overall cost is staggering, facing a $264 million revenue shortfall in next year's budget. B.U. top reserves froze and reduced salaries. And now the university is planning layoffs. The Chronicle for Higher Education is tracking plans nationwide, based on the roughly 1,200 colleges researchers have looked at, just over half planned to welcome students for classes on campus. A third are planning hybrid models. Meaning, a mix of in-person and online. And roughly 10 percent are slated to go fully or mostly online. ANDY THOMASON, SENIOR EDITOR, THE CHRONICLES OF HIGHER EDUCATION: More campuses are beginning to reverse their plans for in-person instruction in favor of an online approach, and they're citing, you know, worsening public health trends as the primary reason for that. (END VIDEOTAPE) LINE: And while students attend the classes online, most will still be paying full tuition, including those going to Harvard. There are some colleges offering discounts, notably, Princeton, offering a 10 percent break. Bret? BAIER: Molly Line in Boston. Molly, thanks. Up next, we meet the North Carolina man seeking to become the youngest elected member of Congress in more than 200 years. First, \"BEYOND OUR BORDERS\" tonight. Iranian officials called the interception of the Iranian passenger plane by a U.S. fighter jet in the skies over Syria illegal. Iran is threatening action against Washington over this incident. A U.S. official confirms an American jet passed by the Iranian airliner but at a safe distance. The Taliban in Afghanistan, say they are ready for talks with Afghanistan's political leadership after the Muslim holiday at the end of July. The terror group is offering to hand over the last of the government's prisoners in a week's time providing the government frees the last of its Taliban prisoners as well. Turkish President Erdogan joined hundreds of worshipers for the first Muslim prayers in 86 years inside Hagia Sophia. The Istanbul landmark has been one of Christendom's most significant cathedrals, a mosque, and a museum before its conversion back into a Muslim place of worship. Just some of the other stories, \"BEYOND OUR BORDERS\" tonight. We'll be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BAIER: This evening, we introduce you to a young man who wants to make history. Senior political correspondent Mike Emanuel has his story tonight. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MIKE EMANUEL, FOX NEWS CHIEF CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Madison Cawthorn is aiming to become the youngest person elected to Congress since the late 1700s. The first move was to defeat his opponent in the North Carolina primary, which he did overwhelmingly. The second is pretty easy. He will be legally old enough to serve when he turns 25 on August 1st. President Trump and the man whose see he could be filling chief of staff mark meadows actually backed Cawthorn's primary opponent. But Tuesday at the president's invitation, Cawthorn brought his family to the White House. MADISON CAWTHORN (R), CONGRESSIONAL CANDIDATE, NORTH CAROLINA: It was definitely not a referendum on Trump with that endorsement. And so, he was very aware of that today and he was very excited to get to work with us in the future. EMANUEL: Cawthorn also had a chance encounter with the president, Senator Lindsey Graham, and Rudy Giuliani, while visiting the Trump International Hotel. CAWTHORN: I got big shoes to fill right here. EMANUEL: He's also making the rounds with leading Republicans like GOP Whip Steve Scalise. CAWTHORN: They were impressed with the way we've been running our campaign. So, they wanted us to just keep doing what we were doing. EMANUEL: As a member of Gen Z, Cawthorn, says the Republican Party is struggling to reach his peers. CAWTHORN: They are not able to connect with this generational time bomb. They're not -- they've tried to defuse it, but they're unable to. I'm a millennial. EMANUEL: He says he can speak to young voters and will be helpful to the GOP. CAWTHORN: We don't want government telling us what to do. We don't want these high tax rates, we just want to be able to live our lives, and that resonates with everyone. EMANUEL: I asked Cawthorn about the recent confederate names and statue issue. CAWTHORN: That's not something to be decided by an angry mob. If we want to take down statues of imperfect people, we have to take them all down. EMANUEL: Some of Cawthorn's maturity likely comes from the fact he was nearly killed in a car accident six years ago. CAWTHORN: When I was 19 years old, I exited the hospital with over $3 million in medical debt. EMANUEL: Cawthorn believes he is here for a reason. CAWTHORN: I still have the ability to make a difference. The lord decided to protect my mind, protect my ability to speak, and through that accident. And now I've got this motivation, this passion, the zeal to realize that our life can be taken from us at any moment. EMANUEL: In Washington, Mike Emanuel, Fox News. (END VIDEOTAPE) BAIER: ON the other end of the age spectrum, there is Joe Biden. He's 77- years-old, seeking to become the oldest American ever elected president. This evening, a look at Biden's long political resume through its twist and turns, a lot of time here in Washington. Here is FOX Business Correspondent Hillary Vaughn. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JOE BIDEN, (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Every major crime bill since 1976 has had the name of the Democratic senator from the state of Delaware, Joe Biden. HILLARY VAUGHN, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: The 1994 Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act is now blamed for mass incarcerations of black and brown Americans. Biden helped write it and later regretted it. BIDEN: It was a big mistake when it was made. VAUGHN: Biden did do one thing to combat crime that he hasn't taken back, the Violence Against Women Act, calling it the single most significant legislation he crafted. Biden, a foreign policy hawk at the time, campaigned hard for the war in Afghanistan. BIDEN: We must stay involved in the region after the initial job is done. VAUGHN: Biden also backed the invasion in Iraq. BIDEN: It was the right vote then and it would be the correct vote today. VAUGHN: Two years later Biden took it back, saying it was a mistake, and today wants to end the two wars he once supported. BIDEN: It's long past time we end the forever wars. VAUGHN: As Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee Biden was in charge of the headline grabbing hearing for nominee to the high court, Clarence Thomas. His decision not to allow witnesses who would support Anita Hill's claims has come under scrutiny. BIDEN: I do apologize to the women of America if they got the wrong impression. VAUGHN: But it took 28 years before Biden apologized to Anita Hill, expressing, quote, \"his regret for what she endured.\" Biden was also against gay marriage in the Senate before he was for it in the White House. BARACK OBAMA, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT: You know what it's like and how lonely it can be to make tough decisions, where not every decision is going to be perfect. (END VIDEOTAPE) VAUGHN: In 1995, Biden tried to balance the budget by freezing entitlements like Medicare four times, but failed. Today, Biden wants to grow the government's budget by trillions, another example of something he tried to do as senator that he doesn't want to do as president. Bret? BAIER: Hillary, thank you. President Trump has presented former Kansas congressman and Olympic athlete Jim Ryun with the Presidential Medal of Freedom. Ryun served in Congress from 1996 to 2006, but his fame was as one of the most accomplished American runners in history. In 1964, the 17-year-old Ryun became the first high schooler to record a sub four-minute mile. He later smashed the world record in the mile, won the Silver Medal in the 1,500 meters in the 1968 Olympics. Up next with the panel, coronavirus politics and Candidate Casino. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DR. DEBORAH BIRX, WHITE HOUSE CORONAVIRUS RESPONSE COORDINATOR: The president said when we did opening up America again guidelines that he would step in when he saw things that had to be corrected. MCENANY: The circumstances changed in Florida where we intended to have the convention. As the circumstances on the ground changed, the president changed his viewpoint on having the convention in Jacksonville. TRUMP: We're going to do some other things with tele-rallies and online the week that we are discussing. I'll still do a convention speech in a different form. But we won't do a big, crowded convention per se. It's just not the right time for that. (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: Coronavirus changing pretty much everything in our country, including how this political race is going to turn out. In Florida, the number of cases, you can see here on the average there from Johns Hopkins, the seven-day rolling average, you see shooting up. And if you look at the U.S. daily cases and deaths, deaths is the blue line there, cases being the yellow line. And you can see where we are here at the end of July. Hospitalizations track in Florida, that number as well, which is why the RNC is not going to be in Jacksonville. We'll see what it looks like coming forward. Let's bring in our panel, former White House press secretary, Ari Fleischer, Leslie Marshall, Democrat strategist, and Steve Hayes, editor of \"The Dispatch.\" Ari, how do you think this is going to work from now until November 3rd, what this election is going to look like? ARI FLEISCHER, FORMER WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: It's going to look nothing like we've ever seen before. I think you have to go back to the late 1800s when candidates didn't campaign. That is probably the reality of no rallies, no public events, the debates are going to take on an even bigger importance because there will be so few other events to measure especially Joe Biden by. But corona remains, Bret, the biggest issue. And I'm convinced until the president successfully deals with corona, it will be very hard for him to make the economy, or to make law and order, as he puts it, the main issues in this campaign. And that's why I thought it is a welcome change this week how realistic the president was about corona, how frank he was, his actions in canceling the convention. These are the steps he needs to take to help reset this race and just face corona head on. BAIER: Here, Leslie, is Dr. Fauci, over the past couple of days and today. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES: \u00a0It so efficient in its ability to transmit from human to human that I think we ultimately will get control of it. I don't really see us eradicating it. We certainly can control it better than we're doing. And if we can do that at the global level, when we get a vaccine, I think we can really stop it dead in its tracks. (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: And really the hope is that these therapeutics come around and they're better and treating coronavirus before we get a vaccine, Leslie. LESLIE MARSHALL, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: Yes, absolutely. I was talking to my husband about this, and he said, look, this is a living thing, and it needs us to continue to live, and just like us, it wants to live. Most viruses we live with or we develop vaccines for things in our lives. You've heard of polio and other things that we couldn't survive at one time and do survive now. Here's the problem, though, Bret. We've lost a lot of time with messaging. We've lost a lot of time with making this political and it's not. It's very societal and medical. We as a nation have a responsibility to wear our masks, practice our social distancing. I agree with Ari, I think the president has finally come around. But it's five months too late. If we had been told as a nation social distance, put your mask on, or lock the place down for three weeks, this would be perhaps a different conversation. But definitely with the election in November, COVID-19 is on the ballot, and the president's handling of it will be the referendum on whether or not he has four more years or he goes into retirement as the president of the United States. BAIER: I will say that there is a push, there's always been a push for social distancing. We did close the country down for some time. Steve, the question is whether there's going to be a reclose in some places because of the spikes we've seen, and whether that's a good thing in the big picture. Obviously, the economy and coronavirus is tied together. STEVE HAYES, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Very closely tied together. And look, I agree with Ari, and I agree with Leslie. What we see from the president this week is better, it's good that he has changed his position on masks, it's good that he's pushing people to take this more seriously than he has. But I think looking at the polls today, it certainly seems that people have come to the conclusion that the way that he handled it to this point was not positive. He didn't do a good job on it. And if you look at the specifics that we now know help curb the virus, help control the virus, as Dr. Fauci said, things like wearing masks, et cetera, the president was on the wrong side of those things. He was mocking reporters in the briefing room for wearing masks, saying it was politically incorrect of them to wear masks. He said we were going to be open by Easter, which was, I think, certainly premature and not what was consistent with his own White House guidelines. So I think it's a good thing that he's not going to be trying to hold the convention in Jacksonville or Charlotte. I think it's a good thing that he's wearing masks. I think it's catastrophic that we didn't do a lot of the things earlier. BAIER: In the meantime, as we look at this election, the campaign, the Trump campaign is pointing towards voter enthusiasm. Take a listen, Ari. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) HOGAN GIDLEY, WHITE HOUSE DEPUTY PRESS SECRETARY: Our supporters will stand through rain, sleet, snow, hail, and crawl across broken glass to vote for Donald Trump. Joe Biden's supporters won't even click on a link to watch him do a Q&A. CHARLAMAGNE THA GOD, RADIO HOST, \"THE BREAKFAST CLUB\": Joe, you've got to hurry up and announce your black woman VP so I can be enthused about voting for her, because I will never be enthused about voting for you. (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: Rough there from Charlamagne tha God. Ari? FLEISCHER: Yes, and Hogan Gidley, the spokesman there, is 100 percent right. Very few people are clicking on Joe Biden's links. Joe Biden has an enthusiasm problem of his own, and in a traditional year, that would really be one of the things that takes Joe Biden down. The difference is Democrats can't get wait to get out to vote against Donald Trump, regardless of whether it's for Joe Biden or not, and that's why I still think this is going to be a 50/50 election. Biden does have a lot of weaknesses, and I still think there's a real opportunity for the president to do better than most Republicans ever do with African- Americans. I still think he's on track for about 15 percent of the African- American vote. And if the African-American vote doesn't come out in huge numbers the way they traditionally do for Democrats, they did for Barack Obama, it can also really hurt to Joe Biden in a lot of the industrial battleground states. BAIER: I want to save time for the lighting round, but I want to do a lightning trip to the Candidate Casino. And this is VP Candidate Casino for Joe Biden's pick. You've got $100 in chips. Really fast, Leslie, first. MARSHALL: Senator Kamala Harris, $60, and I'll put $30 each, I'll split the rest -- excuse me, $30 on Representative Karen Bass, and then $10, forgive my bad math there, on Representative Val Demings. BAIER: They told me there'd be no math. Steve? HAYES: No wonder we have deficits with people like Leslie. It's $25 on Tammy Duckworth, $15 on Val Demings, $15 on Kamala Harris, $15 on Karen Bass and $10 on Susan Rice. I think Tammy Duckworth should be Vice President Biden's pick for campaign reasons. BAIER: And you put $20 on the field? Do you ever make money at a casino? HAYES: You've been there with me before, right? You know. BAIER: All right, Ari, Ari. FLEISCHER: I'm betting low on lots. I've got $20 on Karen Bass, the California congresswoman, head of the Congressional Black Caucus, $20 for Senator Tammy Duckworth, a veteran, senator from Illinois, $20 for Val Demings, Florida congresswoman, impeachment manager, and essentially the rest on the field and on nobodies. I don't think it will be Kamala Harris. I bet only $5 on her. That's as close as you can get. BAIER: Wow, again, spread the chips. All right, we will see. It's coming up soon. Next up, the Friday lightning round. We'll get to a lot of things. Stand by. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MIKE POMPEO, SECRETARY OF STATE: Just this week we announced the closure of the Chinese consulate in Houston because it was a hub of spying and intellectual property theft. We reversed, two weeks ago, eight years of cheek turning with respect to international law in the South China Sea. MCENANY: Our action to direct the consulate of the PRC consulate general in Houston was taken to protect American intellectual property and American's private information. WANG WENBIN, CHINESE FOREIGN MINISTRY, (through translator): China has put forward specific requirements for the U.S. consulate in Chengdu to stop all operations and activities. Diplomacy must be reciprocal. (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: Consulate closures here and in China. We're back with the panel. Steve, it is deteriorating. You wonder where the U.S.-China relationship is going to go as we get closer to the election. HAYES: It's unfortunate. You would like to think that we could have better relations with China, but China won't let us have better relations with China. China has been doing this for years. China has been stealing our intellectual properties, stealing government secrets. They have been in our government computer systems. They've been acting like an adversary if not an enemy. I think it's good that Trump administration has decided to treat them like the adversary that they see determined to be, and I think it was entirely appropriate to close the consulate in Houston. BAIER: Ari, it's a big deal. FLEISCHER: It is a big deal, and I think the bigger question is after the election what happens with China. Look, nothing is of greater consequence than what President Trump has been doing both China. They are huge rival, and they became powerful by deceit, by cheating, and by theft. And so I'm glad the president is doing what he's doing and standing up to them. BAIER: There's declassified documents of the FBI intelligence briefing to then candidate Trump, August of 2016. During the ODNI briefs, writer actively listened for topics or questions regarding the Russian Federation,\" more details about basically spying early on, trying to get information about the Trump campaign. Here is the president and Representative Collins. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: This is illegal as can be. This is treason. They spied on the campaign both before and after victory. REP. DOUG COLLINS (R-GA): I'm so happy that John Ratcliffe is there. he is a good friend. We have worked together on this hand in glove. And I'm so happy he's actually now getting to the point where he's saying, no, we're not going to tolerate this. This country needs transparency, and they need to know what they did to the president. They need to know what they did as a candidate. And they need to know how they came very close to trying to subvert an election. That's why it's so important to get it out now before this election. (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: Leslie, this doesn't get covered anyplace else, but it is, too, a big deal. MARSHALL: It definitely is a big deal. But a couple of the problems and things that make people on my side of the aisle, Bret, go um, are Inspector General Michael Horowitz was extremely thorough. And why we weren't hearing more about this then and what will we hear from Durham in that report going forward, that is definitely there. And then the timing of this, the timing of the release and the timing of allegation that this whole meeting was supposed to be a coverup instead of an actual briefing. Again, the timing with the election around the corner, especially with the president's poll numbers really in free fall right now makes a lot of us raise an eyebrow on the left. BAIER: Well, sure. It's just getting declassified by the new ODNI. But we'll see where Durham goes, and we'll cover it always. Here we go, Winners and Losers, quickly, Steve. HAYES: The winner is Liz Chenez who stood down an ambush from fellow Republicans who claim she wasn't insufficiently well with President Trump, and then when the president tweeted at her, she stood up and said, it's no secret that I have disagreements with the president, but my job is to represent my constituent and do good work in Congress. My loser is John Weaver from the Lincoln Project who this week told \"The Washington Post\" that his group, which is supposedly acting on behalf of Republicans who are frustrated with Donald Trump, would serve in the event of a Joe Biden presidency as an enforcer of sorts, going after Republicans who thwart Joe Biden's agenda. There's nothing wrong with being a Democrat, but if you're a Democrat, you should call yourself a Democrat. BAIER: There you go. Ari, quickly, winner and loser? FLEISCHER: Winner is the New York Yankees. The Yankees are undefeated. They defeated the world champion Nationals last night. BAIER: Boo. FLEISCHER: And every single one of them stood for the National Anthem. The losers, the losers are the government officials in Portland, Oregon. They have turned their city over to lawless forces. They have abandoned what we need for public safety. They have attacked federal authorities with the worst messages. And what they have learned is that weakness only leads to more rioters. BAIER: Can you do 10 seconds, winner and loser, Leslie? MARSHALL: Yes, I can. The winner, AOC for when she was attacked by my loser, Congressman Ted Yoho spoke like I would, which is I am somebody's daughter. And shame on Yoho. He was not just attacking her but all women. And Ari, go Sox. (LAUGHTER) BAIER: There you go. That was 12 seconds. All right, thank you, panel. When we come back, \"Notable Quotables.\" (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BAIER: Finally tonight, it's Friday. You know what that means -- \"Notable Quotables.\" (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CHRIS WALLACE, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Will you consider a national mandate that people need to wear masks? TRUMP: I want people to have a certain freedom. BIRX: This particular pandemic that we're experiencing is very different that what we experienced in March and April. TRUMP: It will probably, unfortunately, get worse before it gets better. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The department was established to be the president's personal militia. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: These police officers are not stormtroopers. JOE BIDEN, (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We've had racists, and they've existed and they tried to get elected president. He's the first one that has. TRUMP: I've done more for black Americans than anybody, with the possible exception of Abraham Lincoln. REP. NANCY PELOSI, (D-CA) HOUSE SPEAKER: We have to act, and what they are proposing falls far short. SEN. JOHN KENNEDY, (R-LA): I hate to be a hair on her biscuit, but it's just not going to pass. SEN. RAND PAUL, (R-KY): I just came from a Republican caucus meeting that could be sort of the Bernie bros progressive caucus. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's going to be a pair for sure. TRUMP: We're going to go outside and be with some little leaguers. Mariano Rivera, you know he's the Sandman, right. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I rise to apologize. REP. ALEXANDRA OCASIO-CORTEZ, (D-NY): Having a daughter does not make a man decent. TRUMP: To have a big convention, it's not the right time. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: As the sun set of John Lewis' life last night, the sun rises on the movement that will never die. (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: One week in Washington. Thanks for inviting us into your home tonight. That's it for this SPECIAL REPORT, fair, balanced, and unafraid. We are one week closer to getting COVID-19 behind us. Promise.

I'm Martha MacCallum in New York. And this is a fast-moving \"Story\" tonight. A lot of breaking news for you this evening.And a rapidly changing landscape for the 2020 election. The President canceled the Jacksonville portion of the Republican National Convention when he came out to speak to the press today.Also, we've got some brand new polling numbers for you from Fox polling that show that the President trails Joe Biden in the battleground states of Michigan, Minnesota and Pennsylvania, as we are about 100 days out from the election.Mr. Trump was in a similar position, though, we should point out back in 2016, and after his very surprising victory that year there was a lot of talk in the country about who these voters in this silent majority in America could be? Watch this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Trump voters were long-suffering; analysts say often silenced.GREG MYTROSEVICH, OHIO TRUMP VOTER: A lot of people kept quiet about a lot of things.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: So you don't say it in the polls, you don't say it to anybody else, but you show up and in the voting booth you go Trump.JOHN BRABENDER, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST: They're not answering the phone and telling people publicly they're voting for Donald Trump.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: Could some new numbers tonight from the libertarian think tank, the Cato Institute suggests that Americans are still, in fact even more so now, keeping their politics to themselves. Look at these numbers. 62 percent say that today's climate prevents them from talking about what they believe with anybody. By a large margin, those who identify, though, as very liberal. This is the group who feels the most free to speak out among friends, family, whatever, about their politics.So what exactly does this tell us about the state of the 2020 race? And what is America's growing frustration with cancel culture as an adjunct to that tell us? Marc Thiessen and Marie Harf are here to debate tonight.Also, as Bret mentioned, my exclusive interview this evening with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who just delivered a blistering message to China's communist leadership, calling on the Chinese people to perhaps consider a different path than the communist government that leads them. We're going to break that down and talk to him about exactly what he said about that.That, as China says they are not going to leave the embassy in Houston. We will get for the first time the Secretary of State to respond to them, digging in their heels at that embassy in moments.Then after that, K.T. McFarland is here with her analysis of the Pompeo interview. What's - are we in a cold war with China now? Is China been a failed experiment since 1979? All that with Katie.But we start tonight with Marc Thiessen, American Enterprise Institute Scholar and Marie Harf, Executive Director of Serve America PAC. Both are Fox News Contributors. Great to have both of you here tonight, Marie and Marc.It strikes me every time we have anyone on from the Trump campaign, we show them the latest numbers. Tonight we just showed everybody the latest numbers from Michigan, Minnesota and Pennsylvania. And they always say, look, we don't care. The polls aren't right. There's a lot of secret Trump voters out there, which we saw in a Monmouth poll last week in Pennsylvania. But Marc, it makes it very difficult to gauge where the country is at right now.MARC THIESSEN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Yes. Well, they probably overstated, especially these new Fox News polls show a big gap. It's probably not as big a gap as the polls show. So I don't think Democrats should get too excited about it.But I think that - and questionably there are secret Trump voters. In fact, there was a poll - Monmouth poll in Pennsylvania, that 57 percent of the voters there were pretty sure that some of their neighbors were planning to vote for Trump, but weren't saying it.And there's a reason for that. There's the cancel culture as it has taken hold in a way it has in recent months. I mean, think about this. Is it more or less hospitable environment for a Trump supporter to express their support for the president now than it was four months ago? I think not. So, I think that - I think there are a lot of people who won't tell a pollster that they're supporting Trump and - but are really going to vote for him in the ballot box.MACCALLUM: I think it's fascinating. And when you look at that number, 62 percent say that they do not want to share their political feelings with anybody. And back in 2017, three years ago, that number was at 58 percent. So we've seen increase, Marie, in the people in the country who are just saying, I'm not going to talk about it. I'm keeping my decision to myself.MARIE HARF, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Yes, Martha. And every Democrat, I know is running like Joe Biden is 10 points behind for this exact reason. People were very confident in 2016 that Hillary Clinton would win. We know there was a hidden Trump voter then in many of these swing states that the Fox News poll spoke to today like Michigan or Pennsylvania, where Donald Trump won by very little in 2016.So Democrats are worried about this. They really want to act like they're running from behind. I think these numbers do concern the Trump team, though. And I also think it's a really polarized time in our country. I mean, there are people on the other side of the aisle who've told me that Democrats hate America, and they hate Christianity. And that kind of language, even four or five years ago wasn't really out there. So our country is really deeply divided. We see that every day and it's a real problem. I don't know how to fix it. There's no easy answer.MACCALLUM: Yes. I want you to take a look at some of these other numbers, because they are disturbing. I mean, let's pull up this one. 32 percent worry about their jobs, because if their political opinions become known, they're concerned that they could lose their job.Look at this next one. Do you think it's OK to fire someone who supports Trump or Biden? In other words, if at your job it became known that you had given money to Joe Biden or who had given money to Trump, they support firing you. 50 percent of those who consider themselves very liberal, Marc - I mean, just think about this. So they support - they think that person should be fired from their company, that's a very disturbing number.THIESSEN: Well, it's insane and the reality is--MACCALLUM: I don't know what country--THIESSEN: --that it just show how polarized our country has become. But let's keep in mind - that I agree with Marie that there are some Republicans who say things that are overwrought about Democrats like saying that they don't love America. I condemn that.But the reality is, if you look at that poll, Republicans are more worried - there are more Republicans who are worried about expressing their views than Democrats by 25-point margin. The only group that feels that it's - that has - a majority feel confident about it, saying what they what they believe are staunch liberals.And the reason for that is, because there really isn't a penalty for being a liberal or for expressing staunch liberal views. You're not going to get in trouble at work for saying Black Lives Matter. You will get in trouble for saying blue lives matter. There will be repercussions for that. So I think there is - this cancel culture is going after the Right in a way that it's not over the Left. And we should condemn it whether it goes after conservatives or liberals.MACCALLUM: Yes. I also thought that deeper in that number, the 62 percent, who say that they don't feel comfortable talking about who they support politically, 59 percent of independents said that. So - I mean, these are the people who elect presidents and we don't know, which side they're on when you look at that number. But 59 percent of independents, Marie, said that they did not want to discuss who they will vote for or who they support.HARF: Yes, these numbers are really interesting, and I agree, disturbing in many ways. And Donald Trump as an election strategy hasn't gone after independents. He's really tripled down on his base. We've seen that with his rhetoric and his policies. And so, I don't know where those independents will break.In the polling we've seen from Fox and others, they're breaking towards Democrats and they certainly broke towards Democrats in 2018.MACCALLUM: That's interesting.HARF: But cancel culture is on both sides. Right? Like I'm not on Twitter--MACCALLUM: Is it?HARF: --because I was bullied off of it by conservatives. So it's on both sides and it's not good wherever it is.MACCALLUM: Yes.THIESSEN: Get back on Twitter, Marie, no one should believe you. I won't stand for it.MACCALLUM: It's disgusting what happens these days there.HARF: Thank you.MACCALLUM: Thank you very much, guys. Marie, Marc, great to have you. Lots more to talk to you about, but we'll pick it up next time. Thank you for being here tonight.So China digs in its heels now. This is a reflection of the burning of documents at that consulate in Houston. Now they say they're not going to leave the United States. So we asked Secretary of State Pompeo what he plans to do about that? Next.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MIKE POMPEO, SECRETARY OF STATE: Securing our freedoms from the Chinese Communist Party is the mission of our time, and America is perfectly positioned to lead it because our founding principles give us that opportunity.(END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)MACCALLUM: Are China and United States at a crossroads that could lead us into another Cold War? Perhaps even a Cold War decade. In a speech today at the Nixon Library, Secretary Pompeo said this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)POMPEO: The CCP fears the Chinese people's honest opinions more than any foe, and save for losing their own grip on power, they have reason - no reason to.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: That as China's General Consul in Houston tells POLITICO today in an interview that they do not plan to leave their Houston consulate.Here now exclusively to respond to that and lots of other things today is Secretary of State. Mike Pompeo. Mr. Secretary, thank you very much for speaking with us today.POMPEO: Martha, it's great to be with you. Thanks for having me on.MACCALLUM: Thank you. So let's start there. The consul in Houston says that they do not have plans to leave that consulate right now. What's your response to that?POMPEO: While everyone knows the rules for diplomats. You're only permitted to be there in a diplomatic status with the consent of the host nation. And so, I'm confident, we've had private conversations as well.I'm very confident that we'll proceed in a way that makes clear that it's not OK to use your diplomats to engage in industrial espionage. It's not OK to steal intellectual property. It's not OK to engage in those kind of behaviors. That's the reason we did it. We did it to protect the American people. And we're going to make sure that that happens.MACCALLUM: I guess, the question - they say that you're - that United States is abandoning the Vienna Convention and also violating the China- U.S. consular treaty. You, obviously, think that they've already violated both of those. But literally, physically, what if they say, we will not leave, what will the United States do?POMPEO: Yes. Martha, I'm not going to speculate. We're going to make sure that we protect the American people. President Trump began to talk about this threat back in 2015 in this campaign, and you're seeing his administration begin to do the things that will lead to make sure that the American people are safe and secure.And that the jobs that depend on American intellectual property aren't lost to theft from Chinese diplomats that sit in a place in Houston, Texas with great access to American scientific knowhow and business value.MACCALLUM: There is discussion that China may retaliate by asking us to leave one of the six embassies that we have in China. We also have one in Hong Kong. And it looks like Chengdu and potentially Wuhan are at the top of that list. Will we be vacating any of our embassies in China, Mr. Secretary?POMPEO: Martha, let's go back to first principles. The first principles are this, for 40 plus years now - and this is why I'm at the Nixon Library today. For 40 plus years, America has turned the other cheek while we've watched the Chinese Communist Party engage in activity that's fundamentally not fair to the American people, it's not reciprocal for the American people and it doesn't have the transparency we need, so that we can engage with China in a way that's fair for our people and provide security for people. That's what we're aiming to do.And so this decision about the consulate that was made is consistent with all - whole bunch of other actions that we have already taken. A whole bunch more that we're going to continue to do until we get the change.I talked about President Nixon saying that the important thing was that we could induce change from China. That's the mission set the President Trump has set our course on. So whether it is the indictments that have been handed down by the Department of Justice, or the decisions we've made with respect to Hong Kong.All of those are aimed at inducing change inside the Chinese Communist Party for the simple purpose of protecting the American people. And so the Chinese government will get to make its decisions about our diplomats their inside of China. We will make sure that we do right by the American people.MACCALLUM: So, I mean, it sounds like you're saying that this is a very ruptured relationship. And, if I'm reading too much in to take from that, but it - we may, yes, we may pull out of embassies in China that might be part of this process.POMPEO: Yes, Martha I talked today about actions, not words. I was in Honolulu, just a few weeks back. I met with Yang Jiechi. We had a wonderful discussion. But in the end, what matters are actions, the things that make sure that we protect the American people. President Trump's trade deal was a good first effort. That the Phase 1 trade deal is important. If we get that right, that'd be the beginning of a basis for us to expand a fair and reciprocal set of trading relationships.But look at our diplomatic relationship today. They have many more diplomats here in the United States than we have inside of China. And their diplomats here in the United States have much more freedom of movement, and much more access that our diplomats do in China - inside of China.MACCALLUM: Yes.POMPEO: All we're asking, Martha, all we're asking is we want it to be fair and reciprocal. And that's the aim of President Trump. It's what we're going to accomplish.MACCALLUM: So you talked about the sanctions that we have, there's military exercises that have also become somewhat more prominent in the region. We have two hackers that just received indictments. Are we in a Cold War right now with China? And if we're not, it certainly looks like we are.POMPEO: General Secretary Xi has clearly taken actions that are aggressive and broken promises that are central to how great power nations behave. Remember he made a promise back in 2015 in the Rose Garden with President Obama. He said he wouldn't militarize the South China Sea. You can go look, there's now significant military activity there by China.He made a promise to the people of Britain, to the people of Hong Kong that they would have a 50-year deal of one country two systems. He busted it. He broke it. United States is simply demanding that if the Chinese Communist Party wants to be considered in the League of Nations that have great power and great roles and great importance, they've got to behave according to promises that they make and the rules that have been set out for sovereign nations to preserve freedom for their own people.That's what we're seeking to see happen. Label it what you must. But President Trump understands that the previous administrations, both Republican and Democrat alike, turned the other cheek for an awfully long time.MACCALLUM: Yes.POMPEO: And resulted in a real imbalance in the relationship between the United States and China. We aim to fix it.MACCALLUM: I spoke to trade advisor Peter Navarro on this program several weeks back. And I said is the trade deal basically over? And he said, yes, it is. He walked that back a bit. But, it appears that it is. Is that fair to say at this point?POMPEO: No, I'm hopeful that the Phase 1 trade deal we've complied with by both sides. The Chinese Communist Party tells us that they're going to fulfill their commitments. We have every expectation that they will, and our task will be to verify that they've done so. We hope that they do. And if they do, perhaps there'll be an opportunity to build on that.And what we're not going to let happen is what we've allowed to happen before, is that they make a set of promises, they make a commitment, like the Phase 1 trade deal and then they try and they do a little bit and America calls it good enough. President Trump is not going to permit that to happen. We're going to hold them accountable for the promises that they make, MarthaMACCALLUM: President Trump just said moments ago, that that trade deal is not as important to him anymore as it once was.POMPEO: I understand that. I completely understand it. When you see what the Chinese Communist Party has done to our country and to the world with their failure to live up to another set of promises they made to the world about their responsibility if a pandemic began to break out of their country, the cover up that took place. You can absolutely understand why a trade deal like the Phase 1 trade deal no longer ranks first among all the various issues we have with the Chinese Communist Party.MACCALLUM: Yes.POMPEO: We've seen across the world, hundreds of thousands of deaths. Trillions of dollars in economic destruction wrought on this world, because the Chinese Communist Party failed to live up to some basic commitments to the world.MACCALLUM: You made a very strong appeal to the Chinese people in this speech, basically calling on them to call for a new form of government in China. Are you encouraging them towards regime change? And you said that we would encourage and empower - engage and empower. How will we do that? What - how do we play that role? What will that look like?POMPEO: Martha, I talked about several things. One of which is there are 1.4 billion Chinese people. And what I wanted to make clear in my remarks today is we want good things for them. They've raised hundreds of millions of people out of destitute, poverty, we think that's a good thing. We're not trying to contain the prosperity for the people of China. We're simply trying to preserve freedom for the people of the United States of America. That is the American task.President Trump, when he was sworn in, and I - when I was sworn in as Secretary of State, that's the promise that we made. And so what we are concerned about is not holding China down, but making sure that we all get this right, so that we can have a prosperous economy here in the United States of America, and that we can hold them accountable in ways that preserve and secure freedom for the American people. That's the mission.So when I talk about the Chinese people, I'm talking about making sure that they have the opportunity to participate on a fair and reciprocal basis, in the same way that we expect the American people will.MACCALLUM: I guess - but if I'm the government of China listening to what you're saying, it sounds like you are encouraging the people of China to rise up, to create a different - to push for a different form of government. And we see what's happening in Taiwan where they have a genuine fear that they might be invaded or attacked by the Mainland.You look at what's happening in Hong Kong, where they are experiencing a diminishment all the time of their independence. So those are very provocative words to the Chinese government to say we want your people to push for a new form of government.MACCALLUM: Martha, that's not what I said. Go back and reread what I talked about. This was a speech about the American perspective and the need for a global alliance of freedom loving nations. This is what we're demanding.We know that the Chinese Communist Party has a different system. They still have obligations to live up to promises, promises even that they make to their own people. Our task is to preserve freedom and security for our people. And we know we need partners to do that. We know we need friends.I was in London and Copenhagen just the last two days, talking to them about this. The whole world is beginning to see that when you bend the knee to China, that bad things happen to your own country. So I have every expectation what the whole world, indeed freedom loving people all around the world must demand that the Chinese Communist Party live up to the commitments that it makes.MACCALLUM: You talked a moment ago about - your obvious concerns about this virus and the origins of this virus. Today in the United States we passed 4 million cases, which is obviously a milestone that is difficult for everybody to hear. Nancy Pelosi, the Speaker of the House said that the President calls it the China virus. She said that she is calling it the Trump virus as a result of the President's handling of this virus. What do you say to that, sir?POMPEO: One ought not to make a virus that has had such devastation in United States a political matter. What one ought to do is to call out the people and places that resulted in this virus getting out of Wuhan, China. There's no mistake. There's lots to dispute about the precise origin of this virus. We'd love to know the answers to that. But sadly, the Chinese Communist Party has prevented that.But we know it came from Wuhan. We know they closed down Hubei Province, but didn't close down traveled to the rest of the world. That has caused enormous harm to the United States of America. So this is indeed a china virus. It emanated from there. Make no mistake about it. It is not political. It is factual.MACCALLUM: Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, thank you very much. Good to have you with us this evening. Thank you for your time, sir.POMPEO: Martha. Thank you.MACCALLUM: Former Deputy National Security Advisor K.T. McFarland on where all of this is leading the United States and China. Next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)MACCALLUM: Strong word tonight from Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. He says essentially, Richard Nixon was right when he wrote in 1967 that the world cannot be safe until China changes. And now the United States faces that turning point once again, here he is moments ago.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)POMPEO: --talked about President Nixon saying that the important thing was that we could induce change from China. That's the mission set the President Trump has set our course on. So whether it is the indictments that have been handed down by the Department of Justice, or the decisions we've made with respect to Hong Kong.All of those are aimed at inducing change inside the Chinese Communist Party for the simple purpose of protecting the American people.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: Former deputy national security advisor for the Trump administration. K.T. McFarland joins me now. She's the author of Revolution: Trump, Washington, and We, the People.\" K.T., good to see you tonight. Your thoughts on with the secretary of state had to say there.K.T. MCFARLAND, AUTHOR, \"REVOLUTION\": You know, this is a really significant interview you just had with him and it's a really significant event. And here's why it's important.Forty-nine years ago this month, Richard Nixon, President Nixon directed his national security advisor to go to China and open up relations with China, to bring China into the world.I was a young staff aide to Richard Nixon and Henry Kissinger at that time. I remember this as if it was yesterday.And that set American foreign policy with China in a certain direction for 50 years. And President Nixon was right. He said we will induce them to change. Our thoughts, Republican and Democrat alike was that as China modernizes, as China comes into the world, as they develop a middle class, they will be an open society, an open economy, an open society, but that's not how it turned out.The Chinese in fact have exploited that. And that's why Pompeo was at the Nixon Library today, because he is indicating we now have a reverse. We are now -- we are now acknowledging the fact that the Chinese have stolen intellectual property rights, have militarized the South China Sea, have unleashed a bio weapon onto the world, have practiced wolf diplomacy and so, we, the Trump administration with the United States we're going to have a very different approach to China going forward and that's exactly what he was telling you.And, Martha, I also thought it was interesting when he mentioned to you that he was in Copenhagen, he was in London.MACCALLUM: Yes.MCFARLAND: And he was talking to America's allies about getting the coalition together so we together stand up to China.MACCALLUM: And what does China's coalition look like?MCFARLAND: China has never had very many allies. I mean, their vision of the world and the world that they really want to impose on the rest of us is China is the superpower, China is going to be, they think, the world's major economic political, military, diplomatic power. And then China will determine what everybody else does.And you step out of line for a minute, you try to -- you try to challenge China, you try to go against China and you get crushed. The Australians, for example, the Australians had the temerity to say let's just investigate what happens with the pandemic, with the coronavirus and China turned around and tried to crush their exports, their barley and wheat exports to China. China has, they play with really elbows out sharp. There is President Trump says they are ruthless in their negotiations.MACCALLUM: Yes. Well, I mean, they've essentially someone say they've been buying friends in Latin America, in Asia, in Africa, we know helping with aid and all of that. So, it will be interesting to see if there is a cold war period that we are entering how everything lines up.Secretary Pompeo said we must engage and empower the Chinese people. And he was very careful to say that he is not calling for regime change in China, and yet, you can see these seeds of rebellion in Hong Kong wanting to stay independent, and in Taiwan saying to the rest the world, you know wake up.MCFARLAND: Yes.MACCALLUM: You know, we could be invaded.MCFARLAND: Yes. And I thought that was also really significant what he told you, because he was sort of talking about regime change but he really wasn't talking about regime change.I think that the pandemic, Hong Kong, the South China Sea, these has been a slap in the face in the world and I think it's a wake-up call to the rest of the world. And so, we are not criticizing China, the Chinese people. We are criticizing the Chinese Communist Party which runs China right now which is accumulated more and more power and is a dictatorship, really of President Xi Jinping who is now going to be president for life of China.MACCALLUM: It's fascinating to watch. And it reminds me so much of the Cold War with Russia, we're even in the space race.MCFARLAND: Yes.MACCALLUM: This time it's to Mars, the Chinese against the United States.So, K.T., thank you very much.MCFARLAND: There you have it.MACCALLUM: Great to see you as always.MCFARLAND: Thank you, Martha. Thank you.MACCALLUM: So, the CDC has just released new guidance on how to reopen our schools saying that COVID-19 poses low risk to school age children echoing the sentiment of President Trump today. We are going to talk to a panel of educators with decades of teaching experience about what they think this should look like when we come back.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Fortunately, the data shows that children are at lower risk from the China virus very substantially. When children do contract the virus, they often have only very mild symptoms or none at all.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: Fox News alert tonight. The CDC has just released their guidance for reopening schools this fall. The headline according to the CDC, this virus poses, quote, \"low risks to students and teachers,\" therefore face masks and social distancing are the best defense.Quote, \"the best available evidence from countries that have opened schools indicates that COVID-19 poses low risk to school age children. Reopening schools creates opportunity to invest in the education, well-being and future of one of America's greatest assets, our children, while taking every precaution to protect students, teachers, staff, and all their families.\"Tonight, we are joined by three teachers, all with different opinions about whether students can safely return to the classroom. Leigha Phillips teaches high school English, Krista Herrin teaches kindergarten and first grade special education, and Phil Strunk teaches middle school social studies.Great to have all of you with us today.Krista, let me start with you, teaching kindergartners, how do you feel about the fact that, you know, they say some very young children don't even need to do the mask part necessarily?KRISTA HERRIN, KINDERGARTEN & FIRST GRADE TEACHER: I have a lot of concerns going into the school year. Kindergartners love to share, they love to share toys, they love to share hugs and they love to share germs. And I think it's going to be really difficult for us to keep masks on kids and social distance in a small classroom. I don't have any windows in my room, so I'm just pretty nervous about how things are going to go this school year.MACCALLUM: So, how do you feel though about the statistics that show that it's -- you know, the transmission is very low among children and that the risk according to what we see in other countries appears to be very low in terms of -- even studies that have been done that show that their transmission to other people appears to be very low, that doesn't reassure you?HERRIN: It's reassuring but at the same time, here in the United States, we shut down before we had any chance to spread germs in the school. So that's my big concern is, we don't know. I mean, there are other countries that are showing that, but I just worry when we get closer to the fall and the winter with more illness, that we are going to see a lot more illness.MACCALLUM: Phil, what do you think about those guidelines?PHIL STRUNK, MIDDLE SCHOOL TEACHER: Regarding the guidelines whenever I look at them, I am, you know, it's comforting to see that students under age 10 we're not really seeing a high transmission but it's the number for students over age 10.The New York Times came out with an article that said we're spreading it -- or sorry -- 10-year-olds are spreading it at about the same age as adults. We are working in schools now where like the state of Pennsylvania, that a nurse to student ratio is 1500 to one. That guideline was set back in the 40s. In my home state of Virginia, it's over 800 to one. And the CDC guidelines are 750 to one.MACCALLUM: Yes.STRUNK: We're not exactly set right now to be able to combat this whole currently uncurable virus.MACCALLUM: But Phil, let me ask you this. Because, you know, looking at a chart here that shows the flu deaths in the country. So right now, we're at 30 children under 15. Thirty children under 15 have died, most of them had complicating factors and obviously no one wants to see any child die from any disease in this country.STRUNK: Sure.MACCALLUM: If we can prevent it we of course want to do everything we can. However, the average over the past 10 years of children who died because of the flu every year is 511. And we do not shut schools down from, you know, November to January every year because of the flu.STRUNK: Right. You're absolutely right, we don't shut it down during the flu. One of my big concerns right now is students passing it on to educators like myself. I'm coming home to a wife and we are expecting our first child this November.The CDC has also pointed out that women that are in their third trimester of pregnancy are at huge risk and that's where she's going to be. I think of teachers that have taught with that are overcoming cancer and a lot of other illnesses. And for me, you know, I want the economy open just like everybody else, I want to eat meals with my friends. I want to be able to stand next to a student whenever they're struggling with something.I don't think you're going to find any teachers who are going to say I don't want to be back in school. But for me, my value on human life is much higher than the need to currently open up the education system in an in-person format. Schools didn't close last spring, you know, teachers continue to work tirelessly.MACCALLUM: Yes.STRUNK: And we'll continue to work tirelessly this fall.MACCALLUM: Leigha, what do you think?LEIGHA PHILLIPS, HIGH SCHOOL ENGLISH TEACHER: I mean, I agree with a lot of what they are saying especially if I were working with the young kids, I'd be concerned. I've got a nine, four, and 2-year-old, and I know that keeping their hands to themselves and keeping masks on can be hard so I really empathize especially with our elementary school teachers, middle schoolers aren't much different in all honesty.Just like Phil said, I am worried about my high school kids transmitting it whether it's between themselves, giving it to me and me taking at home, me giving it to my elderly grandma. So, I would love to be in school and I would love to see a hybrid work but that takes a lot of work and a lot of resources that not all districts have and are able to do in such a short time.MACCALLUM: I mean, we've had, you know, the whole summer, or really since March to be adapting to this, there's been hundreds of millions of dollars that went out in the CARE Act to help schools get ready for this and prepare.One of the things that President Trump said had to do with, you know, reallocating money if the schools choose not to open in the face of these guidelines, here's what he said about that.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: If schools are not reopened, the funding should go to parents to send their child to public-private, charter, religious, or homeschool of their choice.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: So, Krista, some schools will open, should parents have the option to use the tax dollars that are allocated to their child to send them someplace else that is open if they want them in school?HERRIN: I think that it's a parent's choice as to where they want their child to go and what they feel would be the best for their family. But I know that more public educators they want the best for what their student needs and they want them to be safe. And so, no matter what the outcome is, the community needs to come together and support the teachers that are trying to do their best.MACCALLUM: What about remote learning, Phil? We've heard a lot that over all, especially for children in urban environments, in inner-city environments, that remote learning has been a failure.STRUNK: Yes, remote learning is going to be challenging no matter what, and I think the other teachers on this panel would agree with me whenever I'd say none of us would suggest remote learning or anything like that because it's easier or better for students, we all know being in a classroom with kids is what's the best option.MACCALLUM: Yes.STRUNK: But again, we're facing an unprecedented time with this pandemic that's killing thousands of people. At this point, I think in the interest of safety, that kind of has to take the top priority, that way we can bring more students back into the classroom in the safe format.MACCALLUM: What about, Leigha, before I let you go, quickly if you can, you know, these studies that show that kids are actually they are in more danger in school than they are staying home. There's instances of abuse, there's difficulties at home, there are things that you don't pick up on necessarily if you don't get to see that child in school every day, does that danger outweigh the virus?PHILLIPS: It's a hard question --(CROSSTALK)STRUNK: I think, you know, they aren't --MACCALLUM: Leigha, if you can. Thanks.PHILLIPS: Yes.STRUNK: Sorry.PHILLIPS: I'm not sure you can weigh -- I'm not sure you can weigh what's more important, a life or a life filled with pain and abuse. I mean, it's a valid point, and it's a concerning point. I know my colleagues and I are all concerned with, but I think there gets to be a point when society and the community has placed too much of a burden on schools to be the police of what's happening, to be the counselors, to do all of these different things.I think that employers, I think the community, and I think all stakeholders need to have an impact on that and need to step up and kind of fill in the gaps where kids are going to struggleMACCALLUM: Yes.PHILLIPS: -- because their life isn't worth it.(CROSSTALK)MACCALLUM: A lot of -- a lot of people are very concerned, you know, if they stay home for another semester or God forbid to the whole school year, all of the loss of learning could be devastating, it could really set a lot of these kids back for a long time.So, I thank you all for your dedication and for sharing your thoughts with us on this today. Leigha, Krista, and Phil, all the best to you as you head forward towards the school year.PHILLIPS: Thank you.MACCALLUM: Thank you very much.STRUNK: Thank you, Martha.MACCALLUM: Thank you.So, coming up, there has been a lot of talk about a violent crime surging in Chicago and New York, but the city of Detroit is also seeing a 29 percent increase in homicides this year. Detroit based Pulitzer Prize winning journalist Charlie LeDuff on whether the feds need to protect his city, next.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: Well, I'm going to do something, that I can tell you. Because we're not going to let New York, and Chicago, and Philadelphia, and Detroit, and Baltimore and all of these -- all cleaned. It's a mess. We're not going to let this happen in our country.(END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: Chicago should be calling us and so should Philadelphia and Detroit and others, to go in and really help them. Because when you're losing many people a weekend, many, many people, you see the same numbers as I do. When you're losing these people, they should call us and they should say come on in.And it's incredible to me but they're not doing it. At some point, they will. At some point we may have no other choice but to go in.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: So, with violent crime on the rise now in Detroit as well, President Trump hinting that it could be among the cities that receive some help from federal officers under the new Operation Legend that was announced yesterday.Homicides there are up 29 percent, and you know, good estimates. I think our next guests will tell us it's higher than that. Nonfatal shootings are up 52 percent over the same period last year, and over the weekend, there were 33 shooting incidents leaving 26 people injured and seven dead.Charlie LeDuff has covered Detroit extensively, he's a Pulitzer Prize winning journalist and says that the increase in crime is historical. He is the author of \"S Show\" there you go. \"This Country is Collapsing but the Ratings Are Great.\"Charlie, always good to see you. Thank you very much for being here.CHARLIE LEDUFF, AUTHOR, \"SH*TSHOW\": The title is still true, Martha.MACCALLUM: So, is the -- what's the answer here? Who needs to come in to help the situation in Detroit, what's the mayor doing about it?LEDUFF: What are they doing about it? First of all, we've had five mass shootings in two weeks, two quadruples, two quintuples, and a nine tuple. So, I don't know what this package is that the president is sending. Are you sending 10 agents? A 100 agents? A thousand? Because our own chief of police says he needs another thousand cops at least.So, we've entered into agreements with them -- they haven't really work what we have task force. ATF, FBI, DEA, the relationship between the Detroit police and the DEA is rotten, it's done. The chief threw them out because of an informant in January who went on a rampage and killed six people. So, I'd like to see some specifics. They had a relationship, now they don't and it's a political year so, I don't even -- I'm not even buying this.MACCALLUM: What's life like now in Detroit for people who live there?LEDUFF: What's it's like?MACCALLUM: Yes.LEDUFF: They are scared and they are angry and they want help. And I don't -- nobody seriously thinks you should defund the police because as we talked about before, we've already done it and look what's happening. And remember, in the next couple of days, those $600 super unemployment checks run out, then what happens?MACCALLUM: So, you heard the president, you know, he talks about sending help. Right?LEDUFF: Yes.MACCALLUM: You say that the police aren't doing their job because they are afraid of the ramifications, you talk about sending in state troopers. You know, what do you think having lived there and worked there and watched all of this, is there a solution that's going to make people safer on the streets?LEDUFF: I think we're in for a slog here, I think you know it and I think the country knows it, the police do do their jobs, there's not enough police to do it and some are afraid to do it. But just last week they pulled 106 guns off of 117 arrestees. Guns are everywhere, what could the governor do? She's not even talking about it, right? She's busy tweeting with the president.Madam, put the state police on the major thoroughfares in the city, seven- mile, six-mile, McNichols, Finco (Ph), five-mile, Telegraph, let them patrol the main boulevards so the police can be in the neighborhoods. That's one way to do it. We've got more state troopers than the president is sending federal agents.MACCALLUM: So, she's way ahead in job performance, she's at 64 percent. President Trump is at 45 percent in Michigan, what do you say about that before we go?LEDUFF: Well, we don't have a very rabid media in this state. You, I think we'll all notice she's got a lot of softball questions. She doesn't get good marks for the nursing homes, she hasn't addressed that. The Senate today voted to take COVID positive people out of nursing homes and have their own facilities.MACCALLUM: That's a good idea.LEDUFF: It's bipartisan. And she's threatening to veto it. And I got to go, Martha. That's all the time I have.MACCALLUM: All right, Charlie, thank you. Come back soon. Always good to talk to you. Best of luck.LEDUFF: Thank you.MACCALLUM: More of The Story coming up next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)MACCALLUM: You don't want to miss this in the latest episode of the Untold Story podcast.

Hey there Bret. Good to see you. Have a good weekend. All right, here we go. Good evening everybody. I'm Martha MacCallum and this is The Story. For the last several days, this first story tonight has been one of the most talked about controversies on Capitol Hill. It's not about the virus or about the stimulus package. It's about what one member of Congress calls an abrupt conversation and another calls a verbal assault. As Americans start to show reservations about rampant cancel culture, this harsh moment between colleagues seems to be ballooning into something bigger. Tonight, in an exclusive interview Congressman Ted Yoho is here to talk about his side of the story. Here is what Representative Ocasio-Cortez says he did to her. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ (D-NY): I was minding my own business, walking up the steps And Rep. Yoho put his finger in my face. He called me disgusting. He called me crazy. He called me out of my mind. And he called me dangerous. In front of reporters Rep. Yoho called me and I quote, (EXPLETIVE DELETED) (END VIDEO CLIP) And here is it Rep. Yoho, Republican from Florida who is not running for re-election, giving his statement on the event. Watch this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. TED YOHO (R-FL): I rise to apologize for the abrupt manner of the conversation I had with my colleague from New York. It is true that we disagree on policies and visions for America but that does not mean we should be disrespectful. Having been married for 45 years with two daughters, I'm very cognizant of my language. The offensive name-calling words attributed to me by the press were never spoken to my colleague and if they were construed that way, I apologize for their misunderstanding. I cannot apologize for my passion or for loving my God. My family and my country. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: Rep. Ocasio-Cortez has made this not about her and Mr. Yoho but she says it is much bigger than that. She says it's about our culture that is accepting of violence and violent language against women. Rep. Yoho joins us exclusively in just a moment. Also coming up tonight on The Story, we'll talk to Professor Joshua Catz who said no more to calls at Princeton to offer compensation perks based on race and much more. We'll talk about that with him in this exclusive interview that we had with him tonight. Then Victor Davis Hanson will join us on the other end of that as well. Also, tonight Congressman Eric Swalwell and Andy McCarthy on yet more breaking news on how the FBI did surveillance on the Trump team. Also, tonight, former NFL player Jack Brewer as baseball kicks off but not before the players kneeled for Black Lives Matter but we begin as promised evening with Congressman Ted Yoho. Congressman, thank you very much for joining us tonight. I know it's been a heck of a week for you and we're glad you came here tonight to sort of tell your side of the story. So it seems that what prompted this on your end at least according to what we're hearing, is that you were appalled by the comments that she made about the fact that poverty and unemployment was leading people to commit crimes. Is that what sparked you? YOHO: That was part of it. Yes. I mean but it's been a series of things. I could go into that but that was something and I just, I asked her if we could have minute of her time and ask her a question. MACCALLUM: You did? Because she said you just accosted her and she didn't know what was coming at her and then she said you called her disgusting. Did you call her disgusting? YOHO: No ma'am. I was coming down from voting from the Capitol as I walk across as I always do and I was coming up just she was coming up the stairs and I asked her, I said, Hey do you have a minute? She goes yes. And we've never had a conversation before, and I wanted to ask her about this policy that she was telling people it's OK to shoplift if you're hungry and it went backwards from there. MACCALLUM: So, did - all right, did you call her disgusting, and did you suggest that she was losing her mind? YOHO: No. MACCALLUM: Did you use those words? You never said she was disgusting? You never said she was losing her mind? YOHO: No, everything was directed at policy. When she told me that yes, she thought it was right for people to go ahead and shoplift if you're hungry, I said seriously where there's many social programs and faith-based programs and all these other food kitchens around, the best that you can do is to offer people in your district to go ahead and shoplift while you're calling at the same time to defund the police. I said those are just absolutely the most fricking, crazy policy ideas I've ever heard, and I said your policy ideas are disgusting and I turned around walked away. MACCALLUM: Now when you turned around and walked away - YOHO: And that is as long as that interaction lasted. MACCALLUM: OK, these stories are so totally different that the two of you are telling so it's kind of hard to know you know which version is the truth but when you turned around and walked down the stairs, did you refer to her as a f-word b-word. YOHO: No, I walked down the steps. I said this is just such a fricking BS and that's all I said and then a reporter came up to me and said what was that about. I said no comment. Did you say this. I said no comment and I left. You know there's another part of the story that's not being told, that she doesn't tell and I don't want to get into that because the policies that they're telling, to tell people you don't have to fund the police department, we need to defund it. I mean, it got defunded in New York, $1.5 billion and then to go out and tell people it's OK to shoplift. Well, I don't believe it's OK for the shop owner who owns that stores, trying to make a living for his family to have somebody come and say well Ms. Ocasio-Cortez says it's OK or what about the student or the child that's watching this with her mom and dad and well, I guess, I can go and shoplift mom. She said it was OK. These are the things that are tearing this country apart and it needs to stop and I can go on and on but I don't want to because I know that's not the purpose of this. These are the policies. MACCALLUM: I'm just curious. You said that she's not telling the truth about. What is that? Because you know this story, I was actually surprised at how much traction it's got but it's getting a ton of attention. People are clicking on it all the time so is there something else that we need to know about what happened between you two? YOHO: Well, I thought it was interesting like I said, I've never had a dialogue with her and I've been meaning to but with the pandemic and the way Washington's working, we're running out of time and I wanted to address this and I do this with a lot of members and I've done this with many members, questioning policies and just to try to get to where they understand. You know so we have an understanding but as I was coming back from my second vote series, I was walking back to my office and all of a sudden, I hear somebody go Ted Yoho. She yells it out. I turn around and she's pointing her finger at me, she goes Ted Yoho, I am not done with you. I'm like OK. And I mean like I said, and so I guess you see what's going on now is she's making hay out of this. She's fund raising off of this. She's out in front of the capitol wearing her COVID-19 mask playing that song boss, I'm not going to say it. Playing boss so and so. Making fun of this but yet she's on the floor, crying saying how bad this is but yet she's out there saying the same thing and you know it's disingenuous. In the meantime, I haven't said a word about this. MACCALLUM: All right so you think she's leveraging this. YOHO: I've been going. MACCALLUM: Yes. YOHO: Well, I mean - MACCALLUM: Well, you got up on the floor and you said, and you apologized. She said she didn't consider that an apologize. I'm sorry that we keep stepping on each other. We do have a little bit of a delay, but she then came back to your latest statement and she said that she didn't see what you said as an apology at all. She said if he wants to continue to lie about what happened, that's his business. They think their little man card will be taken away if they apologize for their absurd behavior. That's her most recent comment. YOHO: No. MACCALLUM: What's your reaction to that? YOHO: Well again, what is that attacking? I mean that's attacking a person's character, his manliness I guess is what she's doing and then she spun those into saying that I'm attacking all women and it was women of color. This was strictly policy and those policies are bad for this nation. I mean do you think it's right. I'm going to ask the American people. Do you think it's right to advocate shoplifting instead of going to your representative and getting help and assistance? Whether it's food stamps and I've been on this thing. MACCALLUM: It sounded to me. YOHO: I talked about that. MACCALLUM: Yes, you have. I did hear you say that. You know it sounded to me that that video that she made, got a lot of attention and it did sound like she was excusing some of that behavior. At least she was saying that she understood where she thought it was coming from and she said she wasn't talking about people getting shot in Chicago and Seattle and elsewhere. She said she was talking about small crime that came from people who were out of work but you know what I want to get to is the point that you just touched on because you said I have had similar conversations with other people about policy. Now did you get heated in those conversations. Might any of those people have thought that you were out of line in your language with them and were those people men and were those people women and did they cross the gender line? YOHO: Sure. I've had conversations with Ro Khanna, Terry Sewell, Luis Gutierrez on several things and we don't always walk away agreeing but we always wind up, it seems like afterwards laughing about things and you know we're going to disagree on that but we're always amicable. And you know I'm there to solve problems and there are many problems in this country. MACCALLUM: So she's really laying down the gender card here. Here's part of her speech which got a lot of attention. Let's play that because I want to get you to react to this. YOHO: Sure. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) OCASIO-CORTEZ: This harm that Mr. Yoho levied, tried to levy against me was not just an incident directed at me. But when you do that to any woman what Mr. Yoho did was give permission to other men to do that to his daughters. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: What do you think about that? YOHO: You know she's entitled to her opinion. That is nothing to do with our conversation. It was strictly about her policies and I went to the southwest border the week after she left. I went into the same cell she was in where she said children are being snatched away from their parents and the detainees were made to drink out of the toilet and she was cussing in front of the workers there and what I found out. They said this is a drinking fountain. This is this and so this has been a history of what she's doing and it's identity politics and I don't play that and I've got a pretty good reputation, whether it's up there or down here in my district. I practiced for almost 30 years. I'm not going to try to defend myself. I feel bad for Ms. Ocasio-Cortez who thinks this was - I called these names. I did not call her these names. This was strictly on policy and then again, I've been quiet about this. I'm not, I'm not worried about this. I can - I'm not asking anybody to defend me. I'm not going on YouTube. I'm not out in front of the Capitol playing whatever that boss something, what's that music. We've got serious problems in this nation. We've got $30 trillion in debt. I've got China breathing down our throats and I'm not going to - This is what's wrong with Washington. They'll capitalize on stuff like this and have identity politics and it's not moving this nation forward and it needs to stop. MACCALLUM: Well, you say you've had similar conversation that got heated with men and women and she clearly is trying to make this into an attack on women. She called you out and said that you weren't decent just because you have a wife and daughters so we you know, there's no doubt that she explained this to the hell and she's got a lot of support behind her from Nancy Pelosi and Ayanna Pressley and other folks who are really making this into a much broader topic. You've also got the bread for the world organization suggesting that maybe they should take you off their board. What do you say about that before I let you go? YOHO: Well, I think it's interesting and I saw the clip before this on Fox news that said I was loser of the week. You're supposed to be fair and balanced. Nobody's even talk to me and if the breadth of the almighty wants to do that, that's fine but I think it's funny how the definition of a democracy is mob rule and you're hanging somebody before you even talk to him. That's wrong and that's another thing that's wrong in this country. We need to come together. MACCALLUM: I agree with you there. YOHO: And if we can have - if we have a disagreement, let's talk about it and let's move on and we may not always agree on and I know that. I mean, I've been married for 45 years and anyways, you take care and I thank you for the opportunity to come on here. MACCALLUM: You're very welcome and we always like to hear both sides of the story. We did not call you or anyone else the loser the week. We don't do that segment here, but we also invited her to come on and talk about it as well so. YOHO: I think it was that show before you. MACCALLUM: OK, all right. Ted Yoho Representative, thank you very much and as I said, we - open invitation to Rep. Ocasio-Cortez because clearly these are very divergent stories and we would love to bring you both sides. Thank you, sir. Coming up, new documents reveal that the FBI was using candidate Trump's intelligence briefings as a place to kind of dig around for dirt in his campaign. We're going to tell you more about this when we come back. Stay with us tonight on The Story. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) MACCALLUM: Also, tonight, evidence that the FBI used an intelligence briefing to then candidate Donald Trump to kill two birds with one stone essentially. While they briefed him, they were poking around for any Russia connections that may be revealed by Mr. Trump or General Flynn. A source telling Fox news that the briefing was a \"cover.\" Agent Joe Pianka wrote in a summary, \"During ODNI briefs, writer actively listened for topics or questions regarding the Russian federation.\" Among other categories document was filed under Crossfire Hurricane and Crossfire Razor, the code names for the probes into the Trump campaign and into Michael Flynn and the document was approved by FBI officials Kevin Clinesmith who's name you may recognize from the Carter Page line of this story and Peter Strzok, of course you know of quite well. So President Trump was asked about this newest revelation last night. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: It's a terrible thing that happened. It should never happen to another president. The fact is that President Obama and Vice President Biden and the whole group of them with Brennan and Comey and McCabe and Lisa Page and Strzok, her lover and beyond them, long beyond them ,they spied on the campaign, using the intelligence agencies of our country, they illegally - this is illegal as can be, this is treason. This is many things you can call it. They spied on the campaign of another party. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: So Democratic Congressman Eric Swalwell joins me now. He is a member of the House Intelligence Committee. Congressman, good to have you with us today. REP. ERIC SWALWELL (D-CA): You too. Thanks for having me. MACCALLUM: When I listened to this and I read the documents from - from this story Peter Strzok says at one point that they should use the CI guy in the briefing, a counterintelligence person in this briefing which is supposed to be an intelligence briefing for the candidate to assess the demeanor of the individuals during that briefing. So they had a counterintelligence investigation into this back in August of 2016 based on what we learned from the Mueller investigation was no evidence that there was any connection between the campaign. So this goes back to what Bill Barr said. It's - it's not legal or ethical to spy on a presidential campaign without proper predication. What's your reaction to this new information? SWALWELL: They were right to do it and I hope they do it if a Democratic candidate ever does that with any country so Martha remember, right before this meeting occurred, candidate Trump said Russia, if you're listening, I hope you hack Hillary's emails. And what did they do? They actually did it. MACCALLUM: In front of an enormous crowd on national television. SWALWELL: That doesn't make it better, that makes it worse. That makes it worse. MACCALLUM: You think that's something sneaky and spying? Oh my gosh. SWALWELL: Yes, he wanted them to - MACCALLUM: So, the fact of the matter is that they had - there was no - SWALWELL: Let me finish Martha, let me finish. You asked my thought. MACCALLUM: There was no evidence Eric - SWALWELL: So, I'm going to tell you what I thought so Martha. MACCALLUM: - that there was any connection. No, but I was just blown away by that's your answer. OK, go ahead. SWALWELL: Like if they don't confront him, that's when we would have a problem. So one, he had just recently said that. Two, by the way, he says in the meeting, Joe, are the Russians bad? It's like yes, the Russians are bad and don't eat glue like should we even have to tell you that. Three by the way Martha, he told the country for years that he was never given this briefing and now we learned that he did which is in line with him saying he never had a Trump tower deals and Moscow extending him to do so. MACCALLUM: Yes but no, no, no. SWALWELL: He constantly lies about the Russia, that's what he does. MACCALLUM: So two things, two things. So one is just based on the facts of the story that we have - I've covered for a long time and you have also been involved in for a long time too. So President Trump was under investigation. Jim Comey said he was not. He said that to Congress under oath. So the President was indeed under investigation. SWALWELL: What would you want a counterintelligence official to do when the President is asking the Russians to hack and they're actually hacking. I hope they look into him. I hope if Joe Biden was doing this with any other foreign country that is seeking to influence our elections, that the FBI would look into it. MACCALLUM: That's fine. I'm just saying - SWALWELL: Thankfully it's not. MACCALLUM: - they have to do it properly. SWALWELL: But that's kind of their job. MACCALLUM: You have to base it on evidence and then if you - SWALWELL: And by the way two months before his son met with Russians at Trump tower. MACCALLUM: - we have the President under investigation. SWALWELL: And two months before his son met with Russians at Trump tower. MACCALLUM: So what? You're allowed to meet with Russian people. I mean this - SWALWELL: Are they our friends Martha? MACCALLUM: People meet with Russians all the time. SWALWELL: They were told that they had dirt on Hillary Clinton. MACCALLUM: I mean that meeting was thoroughly investigated and you know as well as I do that they came up with nothing from that meeting and then it's in terms of the briefing, you say that you know he said, he never received a briefing. Everybody in that room was in on the briefing except for the candidate. He's the only one who was not - no one explained to him, look Sir, you are running for president of United States, we have reason to believe that this campaign, that the Russians might be trying to find some soft spots in your team. That is what needed to be said if the concern was as great as you say but that wasn't what was going on. SWALWELL: Because he's the kind of guy that listens to intelligence briefings like he's given pictures and graphs now because he doesn't have the attention span to listen, Martha so they had a challenging job in the beginning. They have a challenging job now. MACCALLUM: So it's about the fact that he's not smart enough. I'm so confused at what you're getting at. OK. SWALWELL: Yes. Picture woman, man, camera, TV. MACCALLUM: OK fine, Congressman, thank you for being here. OK, fine, it doesn't add up to in terms of the counterintelligence investigation. All right, so let's bring in Andy McCarthy, former federal prosecutor and Fox news contributor. Andy, your thoughts on this latest revelation that came out in these documents in terms of putting in a CI person, a counterintelligence person in the middle of this briefing that is now been called a cover. ANDY MCCARTHY, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Martha, it's the same thing that happened when Director Comey used the opportunity to brief Trump after he won the election and they treated that as an investigative event, not an actual briefing. This is the same thing. It's a common tactic. You try to say provocative things in the hope that you're going to get the suspect to say things that are either incriminating or events consciousness of guilt. I just want to say two things. Number one, Trump didn't invite Russia to hack the Mrs. Clinton. In fact at that point in time, the FBI had Mrs. Clinton's servers in their possession. There was nothing to hack at that point and secondly, Trump didn't deny having this briefing. What he's denied which is true is that his campaign was never given a defensive briefing to be given some information that they may have been infiltrated by Russia. It doesn't make sense for them to have done that because Trump, I think was the main suspect but this briefing was not a defensive briefing. This briefing was an intelligence and security briefing that's commonly given to candidates for President. MACCALLUM: So given these documents, which as you say line up with a lot of what we've seen before, everyone wants to know if there's ever going to be any prosecution in any of this and everyone would like to see what the fruits of John Durham's investigation are. Are we going to see that anytime soon and what do you think based on what we're learning now? MCCARTHY: Well, they're saying the end of the summer Martha. I think you're going to get probably two things. You'll probably get some indictments in terms of like the lower level people, if this is the investigation that implicates the very highest level so being low here is relative but you know, you're talking about people who manipulated evidence, made direct misrepresentations to courts. I think they have a lot to worry about. If you're talking about an overarching scheme, where they would get the top players, I don't think you're ever going to see an indictment along those lines but I do think you'll get a narrative report about it. MACCALLUM: Yes. Andy McCarthy, always good to talk you. Thank you very much. MCCARTHY: Thanks Martha. MACCALLUM: Coming up, moving vans seen clearing out sthe China Houston consulate today after an active retaliation from the Chinese government. That's next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MACCALLUM: There is discussion that China may retaliate by asking us to leave one of the six embassies that we have in China, we also have one in Hong Kong. And it looks like Chengdu and potentially Wuhan are at the top of that list. Will we be vacating any of our embassies in China, Mr. Secretary? MIKE POMPEO, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: Martha, let's go back to first principles. And so, the Chinese government will get to make its decisions about our diplomats there inside of China. We'll make sure that we do right by the American people. (END VIDEOTAPE) MACCALLUM: One day after that from Secretary of State Mike Pompeo China is making its decision ordering the closure of the United States consulate in the southwestern city of Chengdu, a move seen as payback for Houston which was shut down this afternoon at the demand of the Trump administration. Reuters reporting tonight that men who appeared to be American officials were seen forcing open the back door with power tools and crowbars after padlocking another door. Joining me now, Dr. Michael Pillsbury, the director of Chinese strategy at Hudson Institute and the author of \"The Hundred-Year Marathon.\" Dr. Pillsbury, always good to see you. I want to start by putting up a piece of a quote, I should say from Wang Wenbin China's foreign ministry spokesperson who said, \"We urge the U.S. government to abandon the Cold War mentality and ideological basis, look at the bilateral relations correctly and stop its negative behaviors and create favorable conditions for bringing relations back on track.\" So, where are we now and what do you see in all of this, sir? MICHAEL PILLSBURY, DIRECTOR, CENTER ON CHINESE STRATEGY, HUDSON INSTITUTE: Well, the Chinese continued to deny anything wrong on their side and they deny the technology and deny mistreatment of Uyghurs. I saw a clip with the Chinese ambassador in London a few days ago saying the Uyghurs are very happy in Xinjiang in the reeducation camps. So, this is a phase we're in right now -- (CROSSTALK) MACCALLUM: (Inaudible) there. PILLSBURY: -- where President Trump and Secretary Pompeo are raising the pressure on China, but they are still not making significant concessions at all, Martha. So, things are going to get grimmer would be my forecast. MACCALLUM: So, I asked Secretary Pompeo if we're in a Cold War with China last night and he didn't choose to answer that directly. Do you believe that we are in a Cold War with China now? Closing embassies is typically one of the first stages of that. PILLSBURY: We're surely headed toward a Cold War. The Cold War term for those of us who lived through it had a nuclear dimension and a lot of nightmares like the Cuban missile crisis, military crises after military crises. It had period of detente. So, you had the Eisenhower spirit in Geneva, you had Jimmy Carter trying things differently. So, a Cold War doesn't mean really wide. It's just friction and tension. We're certainly in that situation now where Xi Jinping just doesn't seem to get the idea of the seriousness of the pressure. I might say, Martha, it's bipartisan. Joe Biden has some experience in China, has got some very hawkish advisors around him. Nancy Pelosi used to be the strongest person on human rights and civil rights in China and especially the Dalai Lama. So, there may be a temporary competition going on over the next few months of who can be tougher on China, the Biden camp or President Trump. I just point I put my money on President Trump -- (CROSSTALK) MACCALLUM: You say -- PILLSBURY: -- after the speech last night. MACCALLUM: You say that this is a new area for the president in terms of the political pressure versus the trade pressure. PILLSBURY: Yes. Yes. It's one thing to get concessions on trade. And I really admire the phase one trade deal, 95 pages, enforcement mechanism all kinds of details. That was got the hard way with terrorists. Chinese understood it and the tariffs are still on and that's a good deal the president got even though he says he's not too interested anymore. This other area, politics, democracy, human rights, there are violations at the Indian border like that, much harder to put pressure on. MACCALLUM: Dr. Michael Pillsbury, always good to see you, sir. The Story is not going anywhere. We'll talk more -- we'll talk more soon. Thank you, sir. Coming up, a Princeton University professor taking various heat for rejecting a letter that was signed by 350 of his colleagues that would base compensation at Princeton University and benefits in part based on skin color. He felt that was wrong. We're going to speak to Dr. Joshua Katz exclusively, next. And Victor Davis Hanson with his thoughts after that. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) MACCALLUM: A Princeton professor facing the wrath of his colleagues and students and the university president for refusing to sign on to a faculty letter signed by 350 members that called for radical changes to counter anti-black racism. The letter called for differing compensation levels according to race. It also called for course relief, summer salary, and one additional semester of sabbatical. It said that they should reward the invisible work done by faculty of color with course relief and summer salary, also called for additional human resources for faculty of color. So, in objection, Princeton professor Joshua Katz wrote a public Deliration of Independence right around the Fourth of July in part, writing this in part. It boggles my mind that anybody would advocate giving people extraordinarily privileged people already, let me point out, Princeton professors extra perks for no reason other than their pigmentation. Dr. Joshua Katz joins me now, professor of classics at Princeton University. Good to have you with us, Dr. Katz. Thank you for being here. So, you know, you read this document that that goes through these additional things that they wanted to give people almost as a form of -- almost as a form of reparation of, you know, sort of, way to compensate people. So, what disturbs you, what irk you so much that you decided that you were going to speak out? JOSHUA KATZ, PROFESSOR OF CLASSICS, PRINCETON UNIVERSITY: Well, I think every reasonable person of goodwill wants the world to be as just as equitable as possible. And I wrote my piece out of the conviction that my colleagues, the many colleagues who had drafted and signed this faculty letter dated July 4th seek equity and justice in misguided in ways, indeed in some ways that are illegal. So, the points that you just mentioned, for example, I said I thought were really very bad but I should have made the point much more strongly. They're in violation of title six of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. So, if you want to implement them, at least at the moment, Princeton would receive no federal funding at all. That would be very bad news. MACCALLUM: I mean, you make very -- very solid points. So why do you think there is so much support for this among all of your colleagues? Why do you think so many people decided to sign this when as you point out it clearly goes against some of the foundations of our country? And the Constitution. KATZ: Well, in my -- sure. So in my -- in my simple Declaration of Independence, I think just a bit, there were four possible reasons people might have signed, and I concentrated principally on the one that I still now some weeks later believe also on the basis of things colleagues have told me is the main one. Mainly that colleagues believe that some of the ideas in the letter are good and so therefore decided to sign on as one might call allies and not worry about the other ones. There are plenty of things in the letter that I agree with or at least believe more reasonable myself, but there are enough. MACCALLUM: Yes. KATZ: In fact, more than enough that I thought it was a mistake to sign. MACCALLUM: Yes. They talk about forming a committee that would basically decide, you know, who was racist and who isn't and what racist language, what is -- what connotes racist language. But one of the things that really got people fired up in your letter is this mention of the black justice league which you write was active on campus from 2014 to 2016 and you call it a small local terrorist organization that made life miserable for the many including many black students who did not agree with their demands. And boy, do they come at you for this from your own classics department. They said that you had heedlessly put our black colleagues, students, and alums at serious risks. Tell me about that. KATZ: Yes. Right. Well, let me start from the end. So, it's true that I'm receiving an enormous amount of heat from my own department and we're going to have to see how that plays out. The fact is however, that I have not been canceled the university has admitted that thanks to the so-called University of Chicago principles of free speech that the faculty adopted formally in 2015 I am allowed to say pretty much what I want. And so, by the way, as the president and so at least on non-departmental pages or my colleagues. So, I haven't been canceled, I have survived and that's a good reason for places that don't have the University of Chicago principles to adopt them. As for the phrase terrorist organization, I have tried to justify it. I believe I was justified in using the phrase. I understand that some people feel that I was unjustified in using the phrase. This to me is not a remarkable disagreement. People have disagreements like this all the time. The important point here is that people are focusing on this one phrase or that one paragraph and ignoring all of the demands in the letter and the things that I said about the other things. It's not that I'm not willing to defend this point, but they're seizing on -- MACCALLUM: Right. KATZ: -- a piece of rhetoric and ignoring all of the very, very large issues which I don't believe should be ignored. I don't think they think should be ignored either. MACCALLUM: Well, we're glad that you haven't been canceled for the basic fact that you should have the right to express your opinion and not be afraid or feel that it's not an environment where you can express your opinion and lay out your own arguments because that's what should be happening at universities across this country in a fair and honest exchange. So, we thank you, Dr. Katz for being here tonight. KATZ: Thank you very much for having me, Martha. MACCALLUM: So, let's bring in Victor Davis Hanson, senior fellow at Stanford University's Hoover Institution and the author of \"The Case for Trump.\" Victor, you've heard this discussion, and I know you've read about Dr. Katz's situation. What do you think first of all of the demands that this Princeton faculty made in the first place to treat people differently based on the color of their skin? VICTOR DAVIS HANSON, SENIOR FELLOW, HOOVER INSTITUTE: Well, as Professor Kat said, they're illegal, you can't let a university on Orwellian principles like that. But it's a good -- it's a good example. If one -- one person and Professor Katz is a world-renowned linguist and comparative philologist. But if one person speaks out, look who he was speaking out against, Martha. The president of Princeton University is a constitutional scholar. Classics department is supposed to be devotees of Socratic proof and constitutional history and (Inaudible) and Aristotle. And they were on the wrong side morally and on the wrong side of history, much less Princeton University itself. But he spoke out and what happened? It dissolved. And that's what we are seeing now we're are reaching peak Jacobinism. And by that, I mean, that Professor Pinker of Harvard spoke out. The Wall Street Journal just recently said we are not going to involve ourselves in this ridiculous cancel culture. Then we had Bari Weiss at the New York Times, the Harper's letter, Goya failed boycott. We had A&E losing half of its audience because one show was canceled. I think what we're seeing is that we are reaching the peak of this and it sort of a bluster and it's like a big helium balloon that it takes one fair-minded brave scholar like Professor Pinker or Professor Katz to put a hole in it and remind everybody that this is sort of like the Salem witch trials or the 1793 reign of terror in France. That it's some period of mass insanity and mass hysteria and if you stand up to it, it will pass and restore, you know, restore calm and sanity of the country. But you have to stand up to it. If you don't, and you grabble and you apologize you just feed this monster. MACCALLUM: Great point as always. And you know, you have to feel bad for the people who get caught up in that peak moment -- HANSON: Yes. MACCALLUM: -- because usually cooler heads eventually prevail. And I think all the examples that you gave -- HANSON: They do. MACCALLUM: -- are a point to the fact that that's starting to happen. Victor Davis Hanson, sir, always good to see you. Thank you so much. So, days after the NBA unveiled black lives matter on their basketball courts, professional baseball players last night got back to the game and they kneeled in support of the movement as well, praise -- raising the debate about whether political statement are appropriate and are fair game in sports. Jack Brewer when The Story continues. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) MACCALLUM: As professional sports begin again and hurray for that on this Friday evening, many leagues and teams are out with the bolden brace of the Black Lives Matter movement as they get back on the field in the court. The NBA this week made a statement on its games court -- on its game court and then at the home opener Thursday night of the Yankees and the Nationals players took a knee in tribute to the Black Lives Matter movement. Similar gestures took place at the Giants and Dodgers game except for one player which got a lot of attention. San Francisco Giants pitcher, Sam Coonrod refused to kneel and he said this was why. He says I'm a Christian. I can't kneel before anything besides God. I can't get on board with a couple of things that I've read about Black Lives Matter. How they leaned towards Marxism and they've said some negative things about the nuclear family. I just can get on board with that. That from the Giants pitcher. Joining me now is Jack Brewer, a former professional football player and CEO of the Brewer Group. Jack, always good to have you with us. Thanks for joining us tonight. JACK BREWER, CEO, THE BREWER GROUP INC.: Good to be back. MACCALLUM: So, what goes through your mind as you see these symbols on the NBA court and then also the long line, I mean, I remember when this kneeling action started it was Colin Kaepernick alone. But now it will be probably close to everyone I would imagine. BREWER: It really is, you know, for me, I get saddened when I see it. I see, you know, a culture that's kneeling down for black lives matter when their doctrine is antifamily. Their doctrine is antichrist. This is an antichrist movement. If you look, you know, they are promoting our sexual morality issues that go completely against the bible. It's like and these folks are kneeling to this movement and not kneeling for God. You know, you remove God from every portion of our society. And it's time for athletes to start stepping up for religion and for our religious freedoms and the things that are really affecting our communities. You know, we have a spiritual war going on in our country and for Black Lives Matter to hijack that word. Black Lives Matter, yes, they should matter to everybody. But the actual organization is representing the things that are across our society, antifamily, when fatherlessness is running rapid in our country and the people that we see in our streets, the folks that are locked up. You are six times more likely to live in poverty if you don't have a father. You're 20 times more likely to go to prison if you don't have a father. The same people that are having the run-ins with the law enforcement officers are fatherless. And this, this organization, Black Lives Matter in their doctrine in their mission statement says they are against the patriarch system. The bible calls for patriarchy. The bible calls for us to have sexual morality not sexual immorality. This has to end and it's time for athletes across America to stand up for what's right, what's right in the word of God and stop letting this shame, the shaming and this cancel culture completely destroy our nation. Enough is enough. Our kids are dying in the streets every weekend. MACCALLUM: I can't imagine anyone could say it better than you just did and it would be so great to see a lot more activism aimed at what you're talking about in terms of keeping families together and the importance of fathers and what a difference they make in the success ability for the kids educationally and in life. This is Lou Holtz. I spoke with him for my podcast. Just listen to what he said when I asked him about this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LOU HOLTZ, FORMER COLLEGE FOOTBALL COACH: When I look at the sporting event I looked to be entertained and I look at competitiveness and not to get a political message or something else. Don't tell me what I should believe, how I should say, et cetera. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: I mean, it is. It's divisive if you look at that picture standing there, so it, you know, forces this conversation between players in the place where it would be kind of nice to leave all of that aside, I think everybody needs a little bit of an escape from everything that's going on right now. BREWER: Yes, you're so right. I mean, think about sports should be reuniting us. And now you're seeing it divide our nation. And it's just not right. MACCALLUM: Yes. BREWER: Major League Baseball is America's game and we got to get back to that unity one blood, one nation in Jesus Christ's name. MACCALLUM: All right. Jack, I got to jump in, we're going to get off. Thank you very much, Jack Brewer. We're going to be right -- (COMMERCIAL BREAK) MACCALLUM: That is The Story of Friday, July 24th, 2020.

This comes as the Labor Department reports the U.S. added 4.8 million jobs last month and as the president heats up his rhetoric over how to frame our nation's past leaders. In a moment, we'll talk with Labor Secretary Eugene Scalia. But, first, Mark Meredith joins us live from the White House with the latest -- Mark. MARK MEREDITH, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Mike, President Trump invited friends, family and first responders to the White House last night for the Fourth of July celebration while in other cities because COVID cases are surging, celebrations were canceled to help slow the spread. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MEREDITH: President Trump celebrated Independence Day by watching a dazzling flyover showcasing America's military might. But in his prepared remarks, a more somber tone. TRUMP: We are now in the process of defeating the radical left, the Marxists, the anarchists of the agitators, the looters, and people who in many instances have absolutely no clue what they are doing. MEREDITH: White House guests were encouraged but not required to wear masks or social distance. The speech echoed the president's fiery rhetoric a day earlier at Mount Rushmore. While Joe Biden says Americans should embrace the debate over racial injustice. BIDEN: It's past time to fully confront systemic racism and our growing economic inequity to deal with the denial of our nation's promise. MEREDITH: Protests continued throughout the weekend, and in Baltimore, demonstrators toppled a statue of Christopher Columbus. Meantime, there were plenty of fireworks on Capitol Hill last week as lawmakers demanded answers over reports Russia offered bounties to militants to target U.S. troops in Afghanistan. Democrats accused President Trump of ignoring the issue. REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA), SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE: He should spend more time reading the daily presidential brief than planning military parades. MEREDITH: The White House continues to celebrate the latest jobs report with the Labor Department reporting 4.8 million jobs added in June, a potential sign the economy is bouncing back from its pandemic lows. (END VIDEOTAPE) MEREDITH: The president says he's open to another round of direct payments and help for small businesses, but lawmakers remain split, Mike, about how to move forward with this potential next stimulus bill -- Mike. EMANUEL: Mark Meredith reporting from the White House -- Mark, thanks very much. MEREDITH: You bet. EMANUEL: Joining me now, secretary of labor and White House coronavirus task force member, Eugene Scalia. Mr. Secretary, welcome to \"FOX News Sunday.\" EUGENE SCALIA, SECRETARY OF LABOR: Mike, thanks for having me. EMANUEL: Forty percent of the job growth in June of what was a huge jobs report was in leisure and hospitality, which includes restaurants and bars, but now, in some of those COVID hot spots states, those businesses are being restricted once again. How is that going to impact our economic growth? SCALIA: Well, Mike, it was an extraordinary jobs report as you said. We added nearly 5 million jobs in June. Projections have been that we might add around 3 million, so we did extremely well. And across industrial sectors -- for example, we saw a really big gains in manufacturing, saw gains in construction, and we saw gains across really nearly all demographic groups. It was a terrific month. But yes, we have new cases. We have to keep an eye on that. I believe that we can continue to reopen our workplaces safely. Our workplaces can be very safe places today but there are precautions that the president, vice president have underscored and those do remain important. We've gotten a reminder of that over the last couple of weeks. EMANUEL: Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell warned Congress this week that unless the viruses brought under control, the nation's economic outlook is extremely uncertain. So, while the latest jobs report was very, very strong, how much does that concern you about the future? SCALIA: Well, yes, the Federal Reserve chair expressed some concerns, but I think it's really important to again remember how much better than projected we've done so far. Back in May, it was projected that we would lose 7.5 million jobs. Well, we've now over the last couple of months added 7.5 million jobs. In other words, we're about 15 million ahead of what the experts that we were going to do. We're doing very well. We do need to be careful about the virus, but I am just optimistic among other reasons because USMCA went into effect last week. We finally put NAFTA to rest. This was something that was so important to the president. USMCA will be another source of stimulus, job growth to the country. So, there will be talk as we get deeper into the month about possible additional measures but I am optimistic, as I know the president is, about how we're reopening, the success we're having right now rebuilding that really extraordinary economy that we have through February until the virus came. EMANUEL: Last week, spending dropped, according to JPMorgan Chase, according to credit card customer data. Isn't this summer vacation season when people are supposed to be outspending, isn't that the driving force of GDP? SCALIA: Well, overall, spending, retail spending, consumer spending generally, new home starts, all of these have been actually very encouraging economic indicators over the last about six weeks or so, so I think when you did pass the job numbers, look at other economic indicators, Mike, actually, it's encouraging on that front too. Now, you know, that doesn't mean that we should rest content -- we know that there remain many Americans still out of work. We want to help them get back to work. That's why the president is talking about potentially additional tax cuts. You know, it was the president's tax cuts, it was his elimination of unnecessary, burdensome regulations that delivered that amazing economy we had before the virus struck. And so, I think additional measures around those lines do warrant discussion as we continue to move forward this month. EMANUEL: Do you see a V-shaped recovery going into the fall, sir? SCALIA: Those that the indications that we see. We again have just been doing so much better over the last two months now than was being projected. And -- and again, when you look at some of the more micro data, very strong indications there as well, but that said, it is going to be important, as you're noting, that people take social distancing seriously, wear masks in circumstances often where they're not able to social distance and the like. We can reopen safely, we can reopen while the virus is still there, but it will get more challenging if people don't take that seriously. EMANUEL: Speaking of that, on COVID-19, since you are a member of the coronavirus task force, new cases in the U.S. hit the largest single day total on Friday, 57,497. And new coronavirus cases on the rise in nearly 40 states, plus Mississippi, Tennessee, Texas, Nevada, and Arizona all sitting records for hospitalizations on Thursday. Looking at the rising cases in these states, did they move too soon or too fast? SCALIA: We knew that as people came out of their homes, emerged from their basements and the like, we knew that cases would go up. We are far, far better prepared to deal with those cases now than we were just a few months ago. We've got a much better understanding of how to treat the virus. We have the equipment, the hospital beds now to deal with the situation. So, this is something that we can manage, but part of managing it, as I've been emphasizing, individual responsibility as well. So we are positioned to deal with these challenges, but we again will have to take them seriously and the task force is certainly focused on delivering aid to these locations as the cases increase. The CDC, the Department of Health and Human Services are dispatching personnel, expertise and equipment where they're needed. EMANUEL: In terms of economic growth, President Trump is talking about what he would like from Congress in the next COVID relief package. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) INTERVIEWER: Let me start with phase four and what might potentially come later this month. Another direct round of payments for individuals -- do support that at this time? DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I do. I support it, but it has to be done properly and I support actually larger numbers than the Democrats. (END VIDEO CLIP) EMANUEL: Mr. Secretary, do you expect a deal shortly after lawmakers return from Independence Day holiday? SCALIA: I think there are going be a lot of discussions toward the end of the month about what additional -- additional measures may be needed. The president moved so swiftly and so effectively to get bipartisan relief with Congress back in March. That was those direct payments. It was the Paycheck Protection Program, which I think has been really an essential part of the recovery we're experiencing right now. And it was also a very substantial on employment benefit that the president put in place in March. So we did a very good job I think back in March positioning ourselves for this reopening and I think the American people can be confident that the president is going to take a careful look again at what further measures may be needed now. EMANUEL: Speaking of that, the president has also been clear about wanting a payroll tax cut. There's been resistance to that on Capitol Hill with some Republican senators being pretty blunt in saying they are not in favor. Are you prepared to give Democrats an unemployment insurance extension to get the payroll tax cut? SCALIA: Well, I think the payroll tax cut is -- could be an important part of, among other things, bringing Americans back to work and fueling job growth in the country. It was the tax cuts, as I mentioned, the president put in place that had a much stronger economy back in February than people were projecting, and I think that we should listen to the president's views on this as we move forward. In terms of the unemployment benefit, it was a really important thing to do as we were shutting our economy down, Americans across the country were basically being told -- and we needed to take measures, but they were basically being told you can't go to work right now. And so, we needed that substantial unemployment benefit. But, you know, there are some states where you can get on an annual basis, $75,000 a year right now on unemployment. And I think as we reopen the economy, I don't know that we need a benefit like that. During the so-called Great Recession 10, 12 years ago when we had a downturn, the added federal unemployment benefit was $25 a week. And what we did in the CARES Act was $600 a week. So, I think this is something we'll get a look at, but I don't think we need that $600 benefit going forward. EMANUEL: Mr. Secretary, finally, I ask this with great sensitivity since I missed my own father every day. The president has spoken this weekend defending statues in this country, including announcing he'd like to include a statue of your late father, Justice Antonin Scalia, in the new National Garden. What would that mean to your family, sir? SCALIA: Well, it's -- it would mean a lot. I -- I didn't see that one coming, Mike, and it was really touching to hear. I hope it would mean a lot to the American people, too. We need heroes. We need to admire our forbearers and recognize what is great and good in our past. And that is what the president is emphasizing right now. As we were reminded yesterday, we are nation conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal. No other nation can claim such an inspiring founding, so many great forbearers, and I certainly was touched to hear my father included on the kind of a list. EMANUEL: Mr. Secretary, thank you. Thanks for your time on this holiday weekend. Please come back. SCALIA: OK. Thanks so much, Mike. EMANUEL: Up next, states face tough choices as coronavirus cases increase across the country. We'll bring in a global public health expert to discuss what leaders can do to slow the surge next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) EMANUEL: This week, the U.S. hit a record for a single day spike in new COVID-19 cases leading into the Fourth of July. Even as many Americans dialed back their holiday plans, health officials are eyeing trends as we head into the fall and as states continue to reopen. Joining me now, the Director of the Harvard Global Health Institute, Dr. Ashish Jha. Dr. Jha, welcome to \"FOX News Sunday\". DR. ASHISH JHA, DIRECTOR, HARVARD GLOBAL HEALTH INSTITUTE: Thanks for having me on. Good morning. EMANUEL: Doctor, at least 20 states set record highs for average of new cases over seven days with Florida, Texas, California, Arizona, Georgia, and North Carolina tallying the highest number of new infections. Where are we in this COVID-19 fight and how do you explain the surge in new patients? JHA: Yes, so we're -- we're in a pretty tough spot right now. We have large outbreaks happening in large parts of our country. About two-thirds of the country is seeing increases in cases and we got here, Mike, because of a couple of reasons. One is I think we opened up a little too early in some places. A lot of states didn't meet the White House's own guidelines for when to open up safely. We didn't have the kind of testing and tracing infrastructure that we needed. And then last but not least, there's been a lot of mixed messaging on masks and social distancing and so all that has contributed to what I think is a perilous moment for our country. EMANUEL: According to The New York Times, new cases over the past 14 days are up 89 percent, while people dying is down 19 percent. Doctor, is that what you're seeing and how do you explain it? JHA: Yes, so what we know and this all -- first of all, it's always good news to see fewer people dying, right, and there are a couple of things that explain this. First of all, death is always a lagging indicator. By the time -- between the time somebody gets infected and takes a couple weeks before they get hospitalized and get really sick and another week or 10 days before they die. So death comes later. And I think a few things explain this. One is we are seeing increases in hospitalizations, so I worry that we are going to see an increase in deaths. Second is we're getting better at treating the disease. So we may have somebody who spends two or three weeks in the ICU and walks out, they're still going to be pretty sick with a lot of suffering but they're less likely to die. So I think it's a bunch of factors. Of course, the third is a younger population, which we know is less likely to die from this disease. So a combination of age, better treatment and the lagging indicator. EMANUEL: Any signs of COVID-19 weakening perhaps? JHA: There's a lot -- there's always talk about mutations and is a strain getting more virulent, less virulent, so far not really. No evidence that the virus is getting any less lethal. Thankfully no evidence it's getting any more lethal. But I do think doctors and nurses are getting better at treating it and we're getting some new therapies and that's helping. EMANUEL: Dr. Anthony Fauci painted a pretty dire picture this week on Capitol Hill. (BEGIN CLIP) DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES: We are now having 40 plus thousand new cases a day. I would not be surprised if we go up to 100,000 a day if this does not turn around. And so I am very concerned. (END CLIP) EMANUEL: Doctor, do you think it's that bad? JHA: Mike, you know, when he said that last week we were at about 40,000 per day, we are in the 50s now and heading in the wrong direction. So are we going to get to 100,000? It depends on us, right? If we act smartly, and we know what to do to prevent that -- if we do those things, yes, I think we can avoid it, but if we don't and kind of let this go the way we're going, I think 100,000 is entirely possible and that's what we have to avoid. EMANUEL: Stunning. In places where there are spikes, do you think they have to close down again? JHA: Well, you know, look, shelter in place, shutting down the economy, should absolutely be the last thing that you want to get to. And so you want to be aggressive on this and ahead of it. I am very worried as I look at data from parts of Texas and parts of Florida and Arizona that unless they get very aggressive, I don't really see how you stop the increases in this virus. I think some places are heading there and I think we're sounding the alarm because none of us want to go back to a shutdown. That's what we want to avoid. EMANUEL: Looking at the images of the president out at Mount Rushmore, a spectacular venue for the Independence Day holiday, with masks optional and no social distancing. Was that a mistake? JHA: Those are just risky things. Like any large gathering where people are not socially distancing and not wearing a mask is risky. Outdoors is better than indoors, so I was happy to see that, but my take is, the president should stick with the science here, encourage people to wear masks, you can build in a bit of social distancing. It would have made that safer. So this is just about risk management and I'm perplexed why we're not doing the things we can do pretty easily to lower the risk. EMANUEL: Every parent in America wants to know about schools reopening in the fall. You've talked about restricting bars, gyms, maybe even restaurants. Is that really the trade-off communities across the country must make? JHA: Yes, look, I am deeply worried about this. I have (ph) three kids who go to school and the last four months of them being out of school was pretty tough. I'm sure parents around the country are feeling that. And my point on this is if you -- if we see large outbreaks happening across communities, it's going to be very hard to keep schools open. The good news is we think kids transmit less. They are certainly less likely to get sick but if I -- imagine Arizona right now. If schools were open right now, they would not be able to stay open. So the number one task I think of governors around the country is get the virus under control or we're going to have schools shut down for many, many months this fall. And, obviously, none of us want that that. EMANUEL: What does school in the fall look like for much of the country? Are children of all ages going to be wearing masks all day? Is it realistic for first and second graders to keep a mask on all day? And how are teachers and students going to understand each other with masks on their faces? JHA: Yes, so that's a great question. Obviously schools range from kindergarten all the way through seniors in high school who are essentially adults. I think high schools, middle schools it's going to be easier, hopefully, to get kids to put on masks and keep them on. It's obviously going to get harder in elementary school. I think we're just going to have to make some trade-offs. My take is if you're in a community without a large outbreak, with low number of cases, you can probably get away without the little ones wearing a mask. We have got to also think about the fact that it's not just kids, our teachers and staff there. You can't run a school without teachers and staff so you got to protect everybody. It's going to be a challenge, but the single biggest thing that will help us out is if we keep the virus in the community at a low level. EMANUEL: The question everyone I know is asking, how optimistic are you that there will be drug therapies for COVID-19 and a vaccine in the coming months? JHA: Yes, so we've got two drugs that seem to work. They're both really for people who are pretty sick, Remdesivir and Dexamethasone. So these are for hospitalized patients who have substantial lung issues and evolvement (ph) already. Am I optimistic we're going to get an oral therapy that you can just take when you get sick? I'm not super -- look, a lot of clinical trials going on, I would love to be wrong. But the history of antiviral therapy is not a glorious one. We just have not been able to come up with oral drugs that will work super well. Vaccines I am very optimistic we're going to have one in early 2021. The challenge here, Mike, is that there are seven plus billion people in the world and there is going to be a race to vaccinate everybody. We're going to need billions of doses and I'm very worried about supply chains, about having enough vials and syringes and all the stuff. So I suspect spring to summer of 2021 before everybody's going to be able to get vaccinated in the United States. EMANUEL: And how effective would a vaccine be? Do you expect a vaccine that would work with just about everybody or are we talking about a limited percentage of success? JHA: Yes, that's a great question. Look, the good news here is we've got a ton of vaccine candidates, over 100. We've got more than a dozen in clinical trials. I'm guessing here, but my best guess is we won't have one vaccine, we'll have multiple vaccines that work. My best guess is that we'll have -- probably China might get to it first with a vaccine later this fall, but we're also racing, the Europeans are and my hope is that we'll have a vaccine that will at least stop you from getting very sick from the virus. So you may still get a mild -- you still might get mild disease but you won't get very sick. Also maybe the kind of vaccine where we need to get one every year. But that's fine. I get my flu shot every year. If I have to get a COVID shot every year, that's fine. EMANUEL: Dr. Jha, thank you. Thanks for your time. Please come back. JHA: My pleasure. Thanks for having me on. EMANUEL: Up next, the White House faces new pressure to explain when the president was told Russians may have offered money to Afghan militants to kill U.S. troops. We will speak to the leading Democrat on the Armed Services Committee when we come back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) EMANUEL: Coming up, President Trump cast doubt on allegations that Russians put bounties on U.S. troops in Afghanistan. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: I think it's a host for the newspapers and the Democrats. If it did happen, the Russians would hear about it and anybody else would hear about it, that was involved. (END VIDEO CLIP) EMANUEL: We'll ask Senator Jack Reed about the intelligence and the U.S. response, next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) EMANUEL: There was bipartisan outcry this week over reports rush offered bounties to Afghan militants to target U.S. troops. The administration says the intelligence is debatable. My next guest is pressing for cabinet officials to testify. Joining us now from Rhode Island, Democratic Senator Jack Reed, a former Army Ranger and the ranking member of the Armed Services Committee. Senator, welcome back to FOX NEWS SUNDAY. SEN. JACK REED (D-RI): Thanks, Mike. EMANUEL: Classified briefings at the end of this week about the possibility of Russian bounties on U.S. troops in Afghanistan. Reports are the administration is not planning to take any action in response. How concerned are you and what would you do to advise them to, you know, take action? REED: Well, I'm very concerned. And this is based upon just the public reports. If there's credible evidence that Russia is trying to entice Afghanis to kill American servicemen, that is a serious issue. Involvement of Russia in Afghanistan with the purpose of trying to kill individuals, American soldiers, is something that can't be accepted. It should have gone to the president. He should have been aware of it. In fact, there's some indication that it was in his presidential decision brief in the early part of the year, but he did not read it or did not pay attention to it. But that's the type of information that has to be seized by the president, because he's at the intersection of all the different roads of intelligence that come together. And, also, he's the one that's talking to Putin. He's had five or six conversations with Putin. And if this is an issue at all, even if it's one you just want to warn him away from not even thinking about, that discussion might have been very useful. EMANUEL: Republicans like your college Senator Joni Ernst of Iowa say leading Democrats, quote, had access to that same sort of information months ago, so what's the big deal? Is this a failure across our government, sir? REED: I -- it's not a failure across the government. The way the information is structured in terms of the presentation is first the president, as you would expect, every day gets a daily briefing, which is the most sensitive information that the intelligence community can come together. One of the things we've heard about President Trump is that he seldom reads them every day, maybe once a day, maybe once every three or four days, so there's, I think, a gap that has to be filled. And then there's another level of information, highly classified information, that goes to the big eight. Those are the -- the ranking Democrats. But the rank and file Democrats and rank and file Republicans don't typically get access to these kinds of very, very highly sensitive reports. EMANUEL: President Trump is threatening to veto the bipartisan National Defense Authorization Act over renaming military installations that bear confederate names. As a former Army Ranger who served it Fort Benning and Fort Bragg, what about this name issue? REED: I think we've finally come to grips with our history and we've come to grips with it in the appropriate way. This was a bipartisan initiative. It came out of the Armed Services Committee on a bipartisan basis. It wasn't a Republican initiative or Democratic initiative. It was supported by the committee by and large with very few exceptions. And it's coming to the floor of the Senate as a bipartisan initiative. And I think what it recognizes is that these individuals defied their country, abandoned their uniform, and fought against the United States of America. And to later on, and in many cases it was 50 or 60 years later, to name a post after these individuals does not represent what I think should be consistent with our, you know, honoring of American military heroes. The -- the factor, I think, that is important today is when you look at a post in the United States military, it is composed of men and women, it's composed of Americans of all different races. It cannot be named, I think, for someone who basically pledged his service to a system that was based on slavery. That has to be changed. And it will. It's a three-year process. At the end of those three years, with local import, with military import, with historic input, we will have a name, I think, that is much more fitting for the institution and for the history of the country. EMANUEL: As the ranking Democrat on the Armed Services Committee, what's the big picture impact if the president vetoes the defense authorization? REED: It would be reckless. He would be abandoning the -- the welfare of the troops, their pay raises, their quality living, the -- the housing improvements we've made, the platforms that they need, the -- the -- literally the ammunition that they'll need. All of it for not an issue that I think is comparable and indeed an issue which is being advanced on a bipartisan basis. This is not an example of the -- the -- the president responding to the cries of the entire country and -- and helping save us from ourselves. I mean when you have situations where the -- the assembly in the state of Mississippi chooses to recommend the elimination of the confederate battle flag, that show something about where the country is headed. And the president does not want to go and lead the country. He wants to pull them back. And that's wrong. EMANUEL: The Supreme Court's about to wrap its term. As always, there is speculation about possible retirements. What would be the impact of one or possibly even two retirements in this political season? REED: Well, first of all, I think a -- a justice that would retire for such a transparently political reason would have to think twice, I would hope. Second, it would be the height of hypocrisy if Mitch McConnell tried to drive a nomination through within a few months when he refused to allow Merrick Garland's nomination to come up for over a year when President Obama made the appointment. So I think what's -- and I think the court, because it should represent -- regard its reputation as paramount, I think they would be not particularly wise if they chose to do that and nor would Senator McConnell be, I think, appropriate in trying to ram through a nomination at this point. EMANUEL: Does President Trump have the right to fill one or more Supreme Court seats, particularly if they are conservative justices in this election year? REED: Again, I think it looks on precedent where you have a situation where President Obama certainly had the same constitutional right as President Trump and yet the -- Leader McConnell said, no, I'm not going to let you get your nominee up. So in terms of rights and responsibilities, they're the same. But I think what we have to recognize is, you know, what's fair, what's most deserving of the American people? I don't think they want to see a slapdash nomination of a Supreme Court justice in a few weeks. And I -- again, I think the court themselves, these justices, are extraordinarily eminent personalities. They've dedicated themselves to the law. And their last act to be something of looking like a political expedience is something I don't think that would be favorably viewed by history or by -- by their colleagues. EMANUEL: What can your side do to stop the president if he wants to go forward other than perhaps taking it to the American people, and what does that do to the already heated 2020 race? REED: Again, there are the constitutional provisions that if a seat is vacant on the court, the president has the right to do that. The Senate considers it. That's all there. Those are the mechanics. The reality, the substance is, this is close to an election. The American people want to go ahead and make decisions about their future, including the -- the future of their courts. And I think they should be allowed to do that. This is about letting America speak, not letting people who are conveniently located in the process to exercise their will. Let -- this is about the Americans speaking. EMANUEL: Senator Reed, how are you feeling about the Senate races this fall? Do you see perhaps Democrats taking back the majority in the Senate and perhaps you becoming the chairman of the Armed Services Committee? REED: Well, I feel very good. I think we have extraordinary candidates and I think they are working very hard. And I think one of the problems that my colleagues in the Republican side, and particularly the president, is that we see a situation where the Covid virus is not being effectively dealt with. It's causing huge economic problems. So you have a combination of a pandemic and economic disarray that is affecting every American. And I think, again, people want to see common sense solutions. And what we have seen from the White House has not been the kind of consistent, thoughtful use of the powers the president has. The powers initially to use the Defense Production Act to buy protective equipment so that all of our health care workers would be protected without excessive cost and without excessive delay. We haven't yet seen an aggressive testing program so that we can test throughout the United States so people feel confident that they know they don't have it, nor does anyone else they're likely to see. We've got a whole issue that we have to do in terms of making sure we can go back to school in the fall. I know you're talking to the expert from Harvard Medical School. That's going to be a real, serious challenge. We have to, right now, provide more resources, I believe, for our local schools and local states so that we can get children back to school. And if you don't have kids back in school, you don't have workers back in the workplace because who is going to take care of their children? None of this is being dealt with on a comprehensive, coordinated way. And that has been the situation since the very beginning. EMANUEL: All right. REED: The president has tried to ignore the problem. The president dismissed it. The president went out for his Fourth of July speech, who I think there's one phrase about Covid, when, in fact, Covid is probably -- and the economy are probably the two greatest issues. EMANUEL: Senator Reed, thank you. Thanks for your time. REED: Thanks, Mike. EMANUEL: Always good to speak with you. See you soon back on The Hill. REED: Likewise. Thank you. EMANUEL: Up next we'll bring in our Sunday group on the president's tough rhetoric over historical statues and the state of play in the 2020 campaign. We'll discuss when we come back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: There is a new, far left fascism that demands absolute allegiance if you do not speak his language, perform its rituals, recite its mantras and follow its commandments, then you will be censored, banished, blacklisted, persecuted and punished. (END VIDEO CLIP) EMANUEL: President Trump delivers a passionate and fiery speech Friday night, marking Independence Day at Mount Rushmore. And it's time now for our Sunday group. Former Republican Congressman Jason Chaffetz, Susan Page of \"USA Today,\" and Charles Hurt of \"The Washington Times.\" Panel, welcome. JASON CHAFFETZ: Good morning. CHARLES HURT, \"THE WASHINGTON TIMES\" AND FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Thank you. EMANUEL: Charlie, that sounded targeted at the president's base for months ahead of Election Day. Is it effective? HURT: I think it is because, you know, everyone is talking about try -- you know, whether the president wants to drag people back to history. It's really not about that. It's -- it's about freedom of speech. It's about the fact that people are being shut down in this environment. It's about people marauding in the streets and tearing down statues and doing it without going through any sort of legal process. And -- and people -- lawful, peaceful people sitting at home are watching this happen and -- and they have no voice. And so -- so it -- it really -- it goes much farther than just celebrating or -- or acknowledging our past, acknowledging a history. It has to do with upholding the rule of law and the concept -- the very principles and concepts that were -- were enshrined in the Constitution by these people that we choose to venerate and -- and -- and now we're watching their statues getting torn down. I think it's a very powerful thing. EMANUEL: Susan, what about reaching the political center? Does in the president need to broaden, expand his support in the closing months? SUSAN PAGE, WASHINGTON BUREAU CHIEF, \"USA TODAY\": Yes, you know, the -- I think -- I think Charlie's right, that this helps him with his base, which is so solidly for President Trump. But that does not get him to a majority of the electorate. And when we talk to voters, we find them talking not about cancel culture or the culture wars, we find them talking about Covid- 19, about the state of the economy and, to some degree, about this movement for racial justice where the majority of Americans in polls anyway tell us they feel sympathy, they are moved by these largely peaceful protests around issues like police violence. They do not see this as a battle against Marxism and anarchy. EMANUEL: Jason, what's your take on the present going to Mount Rushmore in the middle of this statue removal controversy? JASON CHAFFETZ, FORMER CONGRESSMAN (R-UT) AND FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, I know that the president went there in part because of an invitation from Governor Kristi Noem that started back in 2017. I think it was the right move. And I've got to tell you, I think Americans are tired. I think they're fed up with having the far left tell them that everything is wrong in America, that the statues you've been looking at, the history of the America -- of America is wrong and that the flag is something you shouldn't stand and salute and -- and I -- I just think America is tired of that. And I -- I think the president standing tall for America and saluting the flag, going to Mount Rushmore, is a good and positive thing and I think it will pay dividends and I don't think that Democrats and Joe Biden have an answer to that because it is just negative, negative, negative and it's not about the future. EMANUEL: Now there's also the effort to lay out camping strategy and define the opponent. Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale saying in a \"Washington Post\" op-ed, Biden wrote the 1994 crime bill. He championed China's entry to the World Trade Organization and he voted for the war in Iraq. He goes on to write, every single one of those major decisions that make up Biden's legacy contributed to the electorate's pushed back against the status quo. Charlie, is Biden's nearly five decades of public service a liability? HURT: I think it's -- I think it is a liability. And you have this strange dynamic where you have a sitting president who gets to run for re-election a second time as an outsider. You've got a guy like Joe Biden, who's been here for 47 -- been in Washington, been, quote/unquote, part of the problem for 47 years. It's a pretty hard thing. And -- and to listen to Joe Biden, well, you know, one of the sort of more amusing parts of this debate about -- that troubles -- I do think troubles a lot of Americans is to listen to Joe Biden talk about how he finally wants to see America address systemic racism. Well, he had eight years in - - in -- in the administration as vice president. You mean you did nothing during eight years to address systemic racism? We're only now finally addressing it? And then, of course, before he was in the White House, he was in Congress for 40 years. And-- and -- and this -- and so, you know, if -- if you do make the argument that there are all of these problems and that there are these systemic racism pervades every aspect of our -- our country, well, I mean, I don't know who you look to, to blame for that, but somebody who's been in Washington, part of the legislature for 40 years who was in the White House for -- for eight years. EMANUEL: Susan, how do you assess enthusiasm? Are Democrats fired up about Joe Biden or are they just motivated to get rid of President Trump? PAGE: Well, you know, we had a \"USA Today\"/Suffolk poll out this week that showed Biden with a 12-point lead. That's pretty -- a pretty muscular lead, but President Trump continued to have an edge on enthusiasm. President Trump's supporters were more -- much more enthusiastic about voting for him than Biden's supporters were about voting for Biden. But Biden's supporters were extremely enthusiastic about this. They were enthusiastic about voting against President Trump. So this is an election like some elections that we see with incumbents running for re-election where President Trump is defining both sides of this contest. He is the motivator both for those who are voting for him and for those who are voting for the other guy. EMANUEL: Jason, as a former chairman in the United States Congress, where does this Russia bounty story go and if top intelligence Democrats were briefed on it in February, how big of a failure is it across our government? CHAFFETZ: Well, I do think the administration needs to continue to provide information for Congress. Think Congress is right for asking for it. The question I have personally is, why do we still have troops in Afghanistan? I mean that -- that still bothers me, the longest war. The president promised we were going to bring those troops home. They can't kill them if they're not there. If we have actionable intelligence, go out and take them and kill the enemy. I don't have a problem with that at all. But I -- I -- I do think that there is more information that needs to be gleaned. I think that Nancy Pelosi and others trying to blame Donald Trump, that he's too close to Putin, that is so yesterday. We had a Mueller report. There is nothing to any of those stories and it's shameful that Nancy Pelosi would try to pain then on Donald Trump. I think that was totally wrong. EMANUEL: Susan, briefly, does this Afghanistan story have legs? PAGE: Yes, there is no issues that unites Americans of all stripes more than protecting our troops in battle. And I think a lot of Americans, on both sides, are looking for President Trump to address this, to criticize it and to say, if it's true, how is the United States going to respond and retaliate? That is something he has not yet done. EMANUEL: Charlie, final thought on this? Does this story go anywhere in the fall? HURT: I have a hard time seeing that it's going to make much of a difference in terms of the election. Largely because, you know, we've sort of been through this -- this fever dream that Republic -- that Democrats have pushed for four years now about Trump and Russia. And --and -- and it's -- and it underscores the perils of -- of trying to politicize absolutely everything. There are a lot of things that we don't know about this case, but -- but one thing is for certain, there are some very damaging leaks that are coming out of the -- the -- the government based on all this stuff and -- and, you know, that's -- those are -- those are serious problems. EMANUEL: Insight four months to Election Day promises to be a very spirited race to the finish line. Panel, thanks very much. See you next Sunday. CHAFFETZ: Thank you. EMANUEL: Up next, our \"Power Players of the Week.\" It's one of the Army's proudest and loudest units that fires those 21 gun salute for presidents. We will take you behind the scenes. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) EMANUEL: They are rarely seen, but you can certainly hear their work from miles away, members of the Artillery Unit that honors presidents and other dignitaries with remarkable precision. As Chris Wallace first told you last summer, they are our \"Power Players of the Week. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SFC. JOSHUA WOOD, U.S. ARMY: The Old Guard bases itself on perfection. SGT. DANIEL STEWART, U.S. ARMY: If we mess up, people know. So I like the fact that we tend to not do that. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Ready, (INAUDIBLE). WALLACE: Sergeant Daniel Stewart and Sergeant First Class Joshua Wood are members of the Presidential Salute Battery. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Standby. Fire. WALLACE: That fires cannons at all the big events in Washington, presidential inaugurations and funerals, special concerts, and visits by distinguished guests, and burials at Arlington National Cemetery. WOOD: When you are shooting for a president, like, that's -- that's the biggest -- that's like the Super Bowl. There is no room for error. The whole world is watching you. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Ready battery. WALLACE (voice over): We got a rare look behind the scenes -- UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Settle down. WALLACE: At the extraordinary precision in everything the PSB does. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Fire. WALLACE: There's a five-man staff and two men on each canon. The watchmen orders each fire. But in the echo of the booms, they found yelling one, two, three got lost. STEWART: Tap (ph). Three. (INAUDIBLE). Step (ph). Ready (ph). Cut (ph). WALLACE (on camera): And you do that every three seconds? STEWART: Every three seconds. Yes, sir. WALLACE (voice over): What if the watchman loses his voice? The PSB has a plan for that. STEWART: Top (ph). WOOD: (INAUDIBLE). WALLACE (on camera): He messes up, and now who does it? WOOD: The chief next to him. WALLACE: Because there's no room for error? WOOD: There's not. WALLACE (voice over): They guns are M-5 anti-tank canons from World War II, that saw action from North Africa to the Battle of the Bulge. Three teams are usually assigned to a ceremony. But if there's a misfire, there's a backup unit just in case. WOOD: My left hand is on my side. As soon as I lift it up, the back-up gunner, like you said, is looking at this hand. As soon as it moves, he pulls his lanyard (ph), which basically sets the gun off. WALLACE: And if there's another misfire, the backup crew has to be ready to go again. WOOD: As a loader, I'll load the rounds in three seconds, putting it inside the breach (ph). Close the breach (ph). And then re-fire. And the same process is done until the ceremony is complete. DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: So help me God. WALLACE: If you think that's overkill, it happened at the Trump inauguration. WOOD: There was actually two or three misfires during the inaugural honors that were being rendered. And I was loading fast enough that it didn't even skip a beat. It didn't sound like anything happen. WALLACE: The PSB is part of the Old Guard, the longest-serving active infantry unit in the Army, that's also charged with standing watch at the Tomb of the Unknowns, which brings us to watch they see as their main mission. WALLACE (on camera): With the military at war and some of your colleagues in actual combat, why is the Presidential Salute Battery important? STEWART: Every family that is in that cemetery, they only get one funeral, so it needs to be the best ceremony you can give. WOOD: You want to give them protection because their loved one served their country. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Stand by. STEWART: I -- I just -- I love it. The firing canons. I love the honoring the fallen. And just paying my respects. (END VIDEOTAPE) EMANUEL: Their precision and professionalism are pretty awesome. This year the team marked the holiday from a distance, firing cannons at noon yesterday, at Joint Base Meyer, Henderson Hall, across the river in Virginia. And however you are celebrating, we want to wish you a very safe and happy and healthy Independence Day weekend. And that's it for today. Chris is back next Sunday. Have a great week and we will see you next FOX NEWS SUNDAY.

Don't fall for the Roger Stone hysteria, just a distraction, just like the Russia bounty story.The president's power to commute sentences almost absolute. George Washington granted clemency to traitors. Andrew Johnson pardoned every single Confederate soldier. Gerald Ford pardon Nixon. Bill Clinton pardoned his own brother. That's what brothers are for. Bill Clinton pardoned the former C.I.A. Director and his business partner, Susan McDougal, and he pardoned the biggest tax cheat in U.S. history, international fugitive, Mark Rich after Rich's wife donated a half a million to Clinton's presidential library.Barack Obama commuted the sentence of Chelsea Manning, who conspired with WikiLeaks and the media loved it.But Trump commuted the sentence of Roger Stone who did not conspire with WikiLeaks and the media hated it. See what's going on here? There was never any evidence of collusion because there was never any collusion. Nobody has ever been charged with collusion or conspiracy with the Russians.Stone was charged in order to cover up a corrupt investigation. Trump's campaign was framed by the Democrats, the C.I.A. and the crooked F.B.I. agents we all know and love.They planted in doctored evidence. They used spies and foreign agents. They illegally leaked hatch stings and got caught.What happened was this. Roger Stone refused to get framed, so they tried to put them in jail. Stone refused to make up dirt about Trump, so they charged him with crimes. How sick is that?If police plant a gun on you, and then you throw it in the river, you shouldn't be charged with obstruction. That's basically what Mueller's boys did here.Stone should have just acid washed his hard drive like Hillary, right? Apparently, that's totally fine.If you tell your buddy not to cooperate with crooked cops because you're being framed, you shouldn't be charged with witness tampering. That's what they did to Stone.And Stone's buddy testified he was never even intimidated by Stone. They charged him with making false statements. You know, easy it is for the Feds to make that charge? That's the same charge they slapped General Mike Flynn with. Now, and new notes we just saw that the F.B.I. released to show that the F.B.I. didn't even think Flynn was lying.Stone told a so-called lie to Congress, but James Clapper can lie and get away with it. McCabe can lie to investigators and that's okay. Congress can lie to you, but you'll get locked up for lying to Congress.Schiff lied for three years that he had evidence of collusion -- false. But Stone said, I didn't collude -- true -- and he gets charged. You can't cover up a crime that never happened. Crooked investigations only produced crooked charges.You can't frame innocent people, investigate them for crimes they didn't commit, and then lock them up when they refuse to go along with your show trial.The jury foreman in the Stone trial was a raging Trump hater also. She was a member of the resistance. She is all over social media disparaging Donald Trump, she hates him, but she lies her way onto the jury and gets caught covering up her bias, so the jury is tainted, right? No. The Obama appointed judge is okay with it. What a joke.Now, I'll be honest. Stone is no saint. He has been playing in the gutter for decades. It doesn't make him a criminal though. He's just a political operator, and somewhat of an opportunist.There's guys like Stone all over the political world, on the left and on the right. Hillary paid for an operative millions to interfere in the election and smear Trump with Russian disinformation. She bought a warrant so Obama could spy on the Trump campaign. It was all fake. But the media doesn't talk about that, because they were in on it. That's 10 times worse than what they say Stone did.Now, I also don't want to hear Democrats in the media crowing about the rule of law either. As I said before, pardon power is perfectly legal. But here's the point, the left spent the last two months looking the other way at looting and encouraging mobs to rip down the public property in the middle of the night, statues.'The left let radicals create their own country in the middle of Seattle and didn't make a move on it until after two black Americans were murdered. The rule of law -- really?Biden's son was bribed by the Chinese and the Ukrainians. The Saudis were sending Clinton's foundation millions, then they murdered someone in their Embassy. Did Hillary send the money back?Did Comey uphold the rule of law when the F.B.I. doctored evidence to illegally spy on the Trump campaign?A Mexican national can illegally cross the border, commit a crime in San Francisco, and the city won't let I.C.E. pick him up and deport him. That's respecting the rule of law?The Democrats believe in mob rule, not the rule of law. That's why they're waging a war on the First and the Second Amendments. That's why when they tried to impeach the President, they jumped over the judicial system and rushed their case to the Senate instead.The media wants an old man to catch COVID-19 in prison and die behind bars. Really? They want hardcore felons sprung from jail so they don't get sick. But want a Republican with no prior record to rot and drop dead.The left is just mad because Trump sniffed out there witch hunt and stopped it.These were processed crimes and a baseless and politically motivated investigation. This was a dirty tricks hit job on Trump, because he was a threat to their power. They tried to criminalize the movement because it put America first.The movement put the people over the politicians, the swamp is going after Trump because they're really going after you, the voters, because you put him there.Trump represents change, the change you voted for, getting out of Syria, rebuilding America instead of Afghanistan, putting a stop to the Germans ripping us off, challenging the Chinese government thieves, shredding the dumb climate and trade deals, securing the border for American workers and keeping judges out of our business and politicians' hands out of our pockets.Stone is small potatoes compared to the stakes of the election. Free Stone, free Flynn, let Durham indict some bad guys, but we have to stop looking in the rear view mirror.The election is less than four months away. There's only three issues: jobs, China and Biden, a dangerous buffoon who is going to destroy everything Americans have been working towards.Trump is the jobs President. Biden is the mob president. Trump was elected because he was a businessman who was looking out for the working man after the Obama-Biden regime let foreign nations and illegal immigrants steal jobs -- good paying jobs, especially manufacturing jobs that were roaring back until the Chinese communists let the virus escape out of Wuhan into the world.The Chinese government lied, covered it up, hoarded masks, gouged us and then blamed us.Trump needs to confront China and rally the country around Made in the U.S.A. and hold the communists accountable.Bringing factories out of China and back to the America puts the foreign policy and the economic policy together. Protecting America from COVID-19 and punishing the source keeps Americans safe and focused.And now it's time to define Biden. He's a fool who can't be trusted with power. He's been a Washington politician his whole life and put America last during the Cold War and the war on terror.He let China and the Europeans eat our lunch while the forgotten men and women suffered. He never protected us from criminal illegals or ISIS, and he doesn't have the spine to stand up to the Bernie bros, AOC, Pelosi, Antifa, or the mob.Biden is an economic illiterate who lets lobbyists and the globalists write the rules and rig the game. Even his family members take advantage of Joe, because he's an easy mark.But don't let folksy good old Joe fool you. It is just a slick sales job by the pros. Biden's an empty suit for socialism.So the Trump campaign should be hammering away at what really matters. Boom, boom, boom. It's right there for the taking. No more distractions.Let's finish writing the American comeback story. There's not a lot of time left.Reaction to that in a moment, but first breaking news in China's coronavirus cover up. Here with that, former Trump White House chief strategist, Steve Bannon, the host of the podcast \"War Room Pandemic.\"All right, Steve, what are your sources telling you about Chinese covering up the virus?STEVE BANNON, FORMER WHITE HOUSE CHIEF STRATEGIST: Well, we know we're starting to have, Jesse, doctors, actually people associated with the Hong Kong lab and people associated with Wuhan, people associated with their entire biomedical and bio weapons defense industry start to defect and start to get information. There's a massive whistleblower campaign in China right now.People have to understand that Chinese people are the victims of the Chinese Communist Party. They've been the victims of this CCP virus, and they're starting to tell the story.Fox News broke an incredible story, I think it was yesterday with Dr. Yan, who is the first of many that are going to start to come out. Some of them are already out in Europe, the United Kingdom and other places.And you're going to start to see now the Intelligence agencies, the F.B.I., others start to put this together of what the real source of this virus was, how culpable the Chinese Communist Party is about this virus, particularly what they visited on their people and what they visited on the people in the United States.The Chinese Communist Party lied, 130,000 Americans died. We have an economic inferno in our country, an economic inferno around the world. We've blown up the balance sheets of the Federal Reserve and everybody else to try to bridge this in a smart way.That is all the responsibility of the Chinese Communist Party. They have to be held accountable, I think you're going to see a lot more Dr. Yan's start to come forward, and I think she's got a lot more to say.WATTERS: Oh, yes. So the defections are going to blow the lid off this thing. And the President needs to be much more aggressive in the way he confronts the Communist Chinese because they need to pay a price.Americans need to see them paying a price and they need to feel it, because that's going to unite the country around a common goal.So, what did you think about my analysis about the stakes in the election in terms of the economic policy, merging that with the foreign policy, and then defining Joe Biden as the bumbling buffoon that he is?BANNON: That that's the playbook right there. Look, the tell was the other day when Joe Biden who is the senator from Wilmington, Delaware, remember, he represents all the global corporations. He's been the biggest globalist in the Senate for 40 years.He pushed W.T.O. for the Chinese. He pushed most favored nation. He pushed NAFTA. You know, Chuck Todd said yesterday on an interview, it is kind of stunning to see Joe Biden trying to recreate himself as an economic populist and an economic nationalist.The reason is, that's where the country is. Donald Trump is a populist. He's an economic nationalist. He is the first President to confront China. But there's so much more to do.Right now in Hong Kong, President Trump ought to drop the hammer. That is Czechoslovakia in 1938. President Trump ought to cut them off from the U.S. dollar. He ought to sanction Hong Kong Shanghai Bank, Bank of China, CITIC, Penang Group, then ought to sanction individuals, Wang Xin and I think he ought to sanction President Xi.WATTERS: Wow.BANNON: President Trump ought to throw down. President Trump ought to throw down. Look, the Chinese Communist Party, they did this because he had built a striver's economy, it wasn't going to be pushed around.The Chinese Communist Party, coming out of that weapons lab and hiding it. We now know and Dr. Yan gives you a detailed analysis of how the Beijing C.D.C. knew this back in late December, early January of 2020, late December 2019.What she told Fox the other day is explosive, every paper in the world has picked it up -- I think you're just at the top of the first thing with her and there are many more like her that are going to start coming forward.Remember, people in China are decent and hardworking folks. They understand the brutality of the Chinese Communist Party. They understand that they are bad guys in a totalitarian dictatorship, and you're going to see, Jesse, many more things coming out.But I think you laid out the playbook. What I would tell the President, it is action, action, action. You're the protagonist in this drama.WATTERS: Right.BANNON: Drive the action. All Joe Biden could do is try -- Joe Biden has got to recreate himself in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan or Wisconsin. Those are your voters, Mr. President. Just complete -- drop the hammer. More Executive Orders on buy American and hire American.Remember, Joe Biden wants to give amnesty to 20 million illegals that will flood the workforce that will suppress wages for African-Americans and Hispanics. He also wants to have full medical benefits for illegal aliens. This will crush the budget.President Trump is both buy American and hire American, and now is the time, I think to drop the hammer on jobs, on China, on sinking the American way of life.WATTERS: Yes, and Sleepy Joe just completely plagiarized that out of the Donald Trump playbook.You've zeroed in on something that I don't think a lot of people realize though. So the Senator from Delaware -- Delaware is the state where all of the multinational corporations incorporate for tax purposes. So, he's been doing their bidding for decades, and that's what this is all about.The guy is just a car and he is being driven by powers that don't have the best interest of the American worker at heart and Donald Trump needs to point that out day after day after day.Now, strategically, when you have Joe Biden hiding in the basement, for a while, I thought maybe you know what, he is surviving in the basement. You know, maybe Donald Trump needs to smoke him out.And now I'm thinking, you know what? Let him stay in the basement. Let him not travel to swing states. Let him get rusty. Let him not see the country and just have them just roll in the debates, not in fighting shape thinking he's going to win like a boxer that doesn't train because the Vegas bookmakers have him ahead a few points. What do you think?BANNON: Look, I think that's one strategy. I also think if you want to smoke him out, it is not going to be rhetoric. You're going to smoke him out with action. Action, action, action on jobs, on EOs about jobs.Biden's line he tried to use in the present is that, all you care about is the stock market and the investor class. That's the biggest chutzpah I've ever seen.It was Joe Biden and Barack Obama that in their administration, we had the greatest concentration of wealth in world history from the crash of 2008 until Donald Trump took the oath of office. Donald Trump's economy, although we had a robust stock market, Donald Trump's economy was a striver's economy.Remember, it's the first time that working class people's wages were increasing more than people with college degrees. That's what we had before he --WATTERS: Donald Trump actually decreased the income inequality that was exacerbated during the Obama-Biden years. You know, everything's backwards, but I think -- I think that the playbook is out there to win this thing. It just needs to be simple and strong and you know, relentless day after day after day. Look, no tie band and I'm pulling the band look. What do you think?BANNON: Jesse, he's a man of action. He's a man of action.WATTERS: Right.BANNON: Jesse, all we need is action, action, action. Let Joe Biden try to recreate you himself when you're the guy you are. Thanks, Jesse.WATTERS: All right, thanks, Steve.Joe Biden, plagiarizing President Trump's economic plan. Here we go again. Up next, Rudy Giuliani on that.And later, the Epstein tapes starring some very famous politicians. A new bombshell accusation from a jewel thief.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BIDEN: I went to law school on a full academic scholarship. The only one in my class to have a full academic scholarship. I went back to law school and in fact ended up in the top half of my class.I was the outstanding student in the Political Science Department at the end of my year. I graduated with three degrees from undergraduate school and 165 credits, only had 123 credits.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Biden now concedes he did not graduate in the top half of his law school class, that he does not have three degrees from college, and that he was not named outstanding political science student in college.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: \"Newsweek\" says Biden actually went to school on a half scholarship, ended up near the bottom of his class and earned only one degree, not three.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: That was Joe Biden years ago taking credit for things he didn't actually do. And he is at it again. He's just unveiled his plan for the economy and guess who it sounds just like?(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BIDEN: When the Federal government spends taxpayers' money, we should use it to buy American products and support American jobs.PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: In my administration, we live by two simple rules, buy American and hire American.Buy American and hire American.Buy American and hire American.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Even the name of this original economic idea, stolen. The slogan, Build Back Better was used by the United Nations back in April.Joining me now, former New York City mayor and President Trump's personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani. You know, we better be careful, he might start saying Make America Great Again.RUDY GIULIANI, PRESIDENT TRUMP'S PERSONAL ATTORNEY: I mean, Jesse, to listen to that is -- I can't understand how he is running for President.WATTERS: Me neither.GIULIANI: The first time I heard about Joe Biden was about 33 years ago. One of his law school classmates was my colleague in the U.S. Attorney's Office, eventually my Chief of Staff when I was Associate Attorney General, and he said to me, you should run for the Senate in Delaware. I said, why?He said, because anybody can get elected. Joe Biden was in my law school class. He was the dumbest guy in the class. He cheated his way through law school. He plagiarized at least once and cheated about four or five times.He's a nice guy, but he is so dumb it is going to take your breath away.And I've known him over the years and every time he'd make one of these mistakes, I would think about what I was told that he was dumb.And then of course, he plagiarized again. Remember when he plagiarized Neil Kinnock, he didn't just plagiarize him, he plagiarized his life.WATTERS: Yes.GIULIANI: He said that his family had never had anyone who graduated from college. They did. He said that they had worked in coal mines all their lives. Only one had worked for a coal mining company as an accountant. He completely plagiarized a man's life.The man is a pathological liar. He obviously has some kind of dementia or Alzheimer's. It's clear.And finally, I happen to know, he is a big crook. The family has been taking money for 30 years. They sell his office. They sold this office in Iraq. They sold his office in Ukraine, and they made a fortune in China.And you know, he always claims, well, I don't know. Meanwhile, his brother is becoming a millionaire. His son who is afflicted with unfortunately with drug addiction becomes a multimillionaire. And this money is for them. Of course, it's for Joe. It's to buy Joe's influence.And then he fixed the case in Ukraine, which the American media is covering up and attacking me over it, rather than going after the criminal, Joe Biden and his family.The guy is a total -- he is a total creation. I mean, it's like --WATTERS: Yes, but Joe Biden is a hot mess and everybody knows it, Mayor.GIULIANI: And now --WATTERS: And now you remember, he comes out and says, don't defund the police. Now, he has changed his tune. Now, he says, we need to redirect money away from the police, almost Clinton-esque. Listen to this soundbite.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BIDEN: Surplus military equipment for law enforcement. They don't need that. The last thing you need is an up armored Humvee coming into a neighborhood. It's like the military invading.They don't know anybody, they become the enemy. They're supposed to be protecting these people.So my generic point is that --UNIDENTIFIED MALE: But do we agree that we can redirect some of the funding?BIDEN: Yes, absolutely.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: So Joe has always been a patsy for the left. He was pulled away left on abortion, on energy, on reparations during the primary and now, he is getting pulled left again by the defund the police movement.I think the President just wants to pin him down on these things in the swing states.GIULIANI: Well, I mean, I worked with him on the Crime Bill of 1994 that provided 100,000 more police. So, this is a totally -- but I mean, I don't think Joe Biden actually at this point, even really understands completely what he is saying, which is really frightening.I mean, the Democratic Party is so cynical, they're running an incompetent -- mentally incompetent human being for President of the United States, which is similar to Mueller.I mean, they got a guy who doesn't have everything going, and they can use him like a patsy, and he is a patsy. He'll say anything AOC wants. He will -- this guy was pro-police.WATTERS: Yes.GIULIANI: Now, he wants to defund the police, which is part of the Marxist Black Lives Matter program, which, by the way is funded by a convicted terrorist, who I happen to convict, Susan Rosenberg who got 58 years in jail and was corruptly pardoned by Bill Clinton.The woman should be in jail right now. She was involved with the Black Panthers who floated police officers. So please don't be fooled by Black Lives Matter.Maybe a fool like Biden can be fooled by it. But intelligent people like the people listening to you should take a look at the three Marxist who founded it, and the terrorist who is funding it.WATTERS: And a lot of that money, you know, when you donate to Black Lives Matter does end up going to the Biden people because it goes through this little wholesale website.GIULIANI: It goes right through a terrorist. The money actually goes right through the terrorist.WATTERS: Exactly. So Joe has been taken advantage of by his family. He has been taken advantage of by the far left, he's been taken advantage of by China and other countries.Can you imagine the level of racketeering and corruption and swindling that's going to go on while Joe is in the White House, not knowing up from down? It's going to be a free for all on the American people. I'll give you the last word.GIULIANI: Well, you know, the only reason I can think that his family is letting him run is because they want to steal more money. They've already stolen millions and sold out the American people. If that were my father or brother, I'd take them off television.I would I would say, hey, Joe, it's time to throw in the towel.WATTERS: Yes, it's elder abuse. A lot of people say that.GIULIANI: You don't make sense anymore. You're making -- but unless, unless, unless I was a greedy crook, and I was looking to make even more money. I mean, they have made about $40 million or $50 million off of him.WATTERS: Yes.GIULIANI: Selling his office.WATTERS: No one wants to report --GIULIANI: They are selling out America.WATTERS: No one wants to report that.GIULIANI: Nobody wants to report it.WATTERS: Where's Hunter? That's all I'm -- where is Hunter, by the way, who knows?GIULIANI: It was never about Hunter. It was about bribing Joe.WATTERS: I know. I know. He is just a conduit. Exactly. He's the go between.All right, Rudy Giuliani, thank you very much.GIULIANI: Thank you.WATTERS: Liberals start the dumbest boycott ever, if you can believe it. Details ahead on that.And the government goes into the home of that St. Louis couple and seizes their rifle. Outrageous.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)JACKIE IBANEZ, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT: Live from \"America's News Headquarters,\" I'm Jackie Ibanez in New York.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi saying legislation is needed to keep this from happening in the future, calling President Trump's actions quote, \"an act of staggering corruption.\"Meanwhile, presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, Joe Biden defining what his presidency would look like. Biden is pledging a sweeping economic agenda, saying it will go beyond anything Americans have seen since the Great Depression and the industrial mobilization for World War II.Biden is also promising to counter centuries of institutional racism.I'm Jackie Ibanez, now back to \"Watters' World.\"For all of your headlines, you can always log on to foxnews.com. You're watching the most powerful name in news, Fox News Channel. Have a great night.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)ROBERT UNANUE, CEO, GOYA FOODS: We're all truly blessed at the same time to have a leader like President Trump who is a builder. We pray for our leadership, our President, and we pray for our country.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Praise for President Trump from the CEO of Goya Foods sparking calls for a boycott from liberals. Imagine that. But that CEO refusing to apologize.Here with reaction Trump 2020 campaign senior adviser, Corey Lewandowski. Corey, like the top three inexpensive meals in this country for families, you have barbecue, you have pizza and you have tacos.There is no way the American people are not going into the grocery store, that little Goya Taka kit. They're not boycotting that. That would be like me boycotting hair gel.COREY LEWANDOWSKI, FORMER TRUMP CAMPAIGN MANAGER: You know, Jesse, look, I hope every person who supports this President and loves their country goes out and buys some of their products.You know, this guy, the only word that comes to mind for me is cojones. This guy stood up to the left. Right? I don't know Spanish, Jesse, but I think that means that that guy is tough. Okay.And what that means is when he went and saw President Clinton, I'm sorry, President Obama at the White House, he was praised. He was jeered. He was a CEO that everyone should admire and respect. He goes and sees President Trump in the Rose Garden, and all of a sudden, you know, the left want to boycott him.This is the hypocrisy of the media, and I think the Trump train is going to come through and Goya's profits are going to go through the roof because of it.WATTERS: Yes. I mean, if you look around out there, I don't think Americans are giving up any meals, if you know what I mean.This reminds me of what Kanye West said the other day, Corey. He was talking about how the Democratic Party uses threats to coerce minorities into staying in the Democratic camp, and this is what that is again.Instead of persuading minority business owners with results or words, they're trying to go after their bottom line with intimidation. That's because the liberals have failed the minority community. And so they have to keep them in line with threats like this.LEWANDOWSKI: Well, Jesse, there's two approaches always. There is the carrot approach and the stick approach and the Democrats always want to use the stick, which is we're going to go after you if you even step out of line or you have an independent thought.Here's what the President has said, I'm going to deregulate the government so you can grow your business regardless of how you own it. I'm going to have empowerment zone, so we're going to put more money into minority communities.This President uses the carrot. It's two very different ways of doing things. We know the President's way works, but if you're not on Team Liberal, if you're not on Team AOC, you're not on Team Hate Trump, then we're going to use the stick against you and you'll be penalized for not supporting the Democratic line.WATTERS: Yes, Corey. I think they're scared because the President is making strong inroads in the Hispanic community. He is up 10 points to where I guess he was against Crooked Hillary. Biden is losing support with Hispanics. So they have to use these types of threats and this boycott movement.Cancel culture, Corey. That's what this is about. You've been canceled before, haven't you? You're always getting canceled.LEWANDOWSKI: Jesse, it looks like we canceled your time tonight. Look, Rudy and I are the only guys who bring in a class to the show.Between you and Bannon, you couldn't find a tie tonight? You guys got canceled on the tie.WATTERS: Sloppy Watters. That's what they call me.LEWANDOWSKI: No, good, Jesse. No, good.WATTERS: All right. I'll try to clean it up next week. Corey Lewandowski, everybody. Thank you.LEWANDOWSKI: Thank you.WATTERS: A liberal prosecutor sends police into the home of this St. Louis couple to take away their weapon. This is what the founders warned us about. A full report ahead on that.But first, a jewel thief says the Epstein tapes are real and he's seen them, next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WATTERS: New claims coming out about Ghislaine Maxwell from a jewel thief. He says Maxwell bragged about having video of at least two high profile politicians and other powerful figures, and that he has seen the tapes himself.An attorney for Prince Andrew accuser, Virginia Roberts says the Prince is one of them, and Roberts says, he should be worried.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)VIRGINIA ROBERTS GIUFFRE, JEFFREY EPSTEIN ACCUSER: We weren't anything important to them at all. We weren't even a human being to them. We were just another toy to be passed around. And that's what they did.Prince Andrew should be panicking at the moment because Ghislaine doesn't really care about anyone else but Ghislaine.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: So who else should be worried? Joining me now, Daniel Halper, co- author of the book \"A Convenient Death: The Mysterious Demise of Jeffrey Epstein.\" I've read it. It's excellent reporting by him and his co-author.All right, so this guy is a jewel thief. You can kind of judge the veracity for yourself. He told a tabloid in Great Britain about this. So this is what he said.He said, you know, Ghislaine and Epstein kind of boasted to him about owning powerful people. He said he saw videos of powerful people, celebrities, world figures, in videos having sex, threesomes, even orgies with minors. He saw videos and photos of people having sex with various young girls, and there is footage of two very high profile society figures with an underage girl and the two American politicians in videos with minors.You've done some reporting on Epstein and Ghislaine, what do you make of this, Daniel?DANIEL HALPER, AUTHOR: Well, listen, I can't vouch for his precise claims, obviously, but it's very consistent with what we know. We know that Ghislaine Maxwell was a procurer for Jeffrey Epstein. That's been alleged by many victims.And we know, worse that she partook in the sexual crimes against these women in many cases.I think one thing to consider is that Ghislaine Maxwell herself was found in America, and I think it's a very striking point. Why was she here in America when she had two other passports, in addition to an American passport? She had $20 million. She could have gotten anywhere in the world.And I think the answer is pretty obvious. She didn't fear getting caught here. She hadn't gotten caught for so long. The Feds had showed no interest in her for so long, and she had gotten away with her crimes.She clearly has something over some powerful people's heads that was able - - that allowed her to run free for so long. And I think it's very good that she is being brought to justice and hopefully, she does cooperate with prosecutors and they try to get to the bottom of this.WATTERS: Yes, I mean, she's in a horrible cell in a correctional facility, and they're not going to let anything happen to her after the mistake they made with Epstein.So, you've reported and other people have reported that every single property he owned from Paris to the Virgin Islands, in Mexico, Palm Beach to Manhattan was wired. Like this was like the real world house. This was this -- this was like, you know, the \"Big Brother.\" You have cameras in every single corner.So if you're a high profile individual and you ever went to an Epstein property over the last couple decades, and you did anything inappropriate with any underage person, there will be surveillance footage backed up somewhere on a hard drive which we have to assume the F.B.I. seized during their raids when they went after Jeffrey and took him into custody.The amount of explosive evidence that we're looking at here, and if this really is true that you're talking about well-known politicians and society types, does she have leverage if the F.B.I. already has the tapes? I guess the only leverage would be that she could testify against people.HALPER: Yes, look that's obviously a legal question. And then of course, there may be other situations of which there's not footage. There were accusations that some of these things took place in Ohio, for instance, that we don't -- that there hasn't been alleged that it is very well wired.I think one of the interesting things about Jeffrey Epstein's wiring of his place and a lot of victims and friends of his have claimed that is that Jeffrey Epstein would allow people at some point to know that they were filmed and that they were wired.It's very interesting. It wasn't just that he had everything on camera. He wanted people to know and I think he did it.WATTERS: Well, let me ask you this because you did some reporting quickly about questions about his ties to foreign intelligence activities. Ghislaine's father was alleged to have had some sort of ties to Israeli Intelligence, I think you reported.There's always been questions about Epstein's role in compromising people for a foreign country. Do these tapes kind of lead you to believe that?HALPER: They've led many people to believe that. I think there are very serious questions. Why did he evade the law for so long and people like Alex Acosta, when he was coming into the Trump administration, he told people in the Trump administration allegedly that he couldn't touch Epstein because he was tied to Intelligence.WATTERS: Wow.HALPER: So I think Bill Barr should be transparent about what's going on, given what's happened to Jeffrey Epstein. I think we should know what's going on, and I think that would be very helpful in getting justice hopefully.WATTERS: Yes. Because that's what this is about. This is about justice for these underage victims.All right, great reporting. Dan. Thanks again.HALPER: Thank you, Jesse.WATTERS: St. Louis homeowners have their rifle removed from their home by force. A dark day for the Bill of Rights in America. That shocking story, next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MARK MCCLOSKEY, ST. LOUIS MAN WHO DEFENDED HIS HOME: Seemingly, everybody in the world came forward. Literally, I think the estimate is 300 to 500 people came right towards us.PATRICIA MCCLOSKEY, ST. LOUIS WOMAN WHO DEFENDED HIS HOME: They were going to kill us. They were going to come in there. They were going to burn down the house. They were going to be living in our house after I was dead and they were going to -- they pointed to two different rooms and set up, that's going to be my bedroom, and that's going to be the living room and I'm going to be taking a shower in that room.And then the dog barked. I mean, there were so many threats and then the dog barked and they said and I'm going to be killing her, too.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Patricia and Mark McCloskey, the St. Louis couple forced to protect their home from protesters now unarmed. Police went into their home and took their rifle, and the pistol reportedly already handed over to their former attorney.But the couple was not arrested or charged. So what the heck is going on here? Joining me now with that by phone, former Florida Attorney General, Pam Bondi.So Pam, this crackpot DA out in St. Louis. She is running in a primary for re-election. She's a total joke. And I guess she got a judge to sign off on a warrant to send police in there to take this guy's rifle away from him. It's very unclear for what reason. This is like the red flag law without the red flag. How is this legal in this country?PAM BONDI, FORMER FLORIDA ATTORNEY GENERAL (via phone): It is not legal, Jesse. I've been a prosecutor as you know, my whole career and then Attorney General. This is an extreme abuse of power by this prosecutor, and this is a glimpse of what a Biden administration would look like.They want to take away our gun. That couple that you're showing on TV, they were defending their lives and they were defending their property, within Missouri under the Castle Doctrine, they had every right to do.These people weren't peaceful protesters. They crashed through their gated community. Armed -- armed -- came up. They told this couple, they were going to kill them. Kill them. They were even pointing out what bedroom they were going to live in, in this couple's home. They were going to kill the couple's dog.Look at them on this footage. It is outrageous.WATTERS: Yes.BONDI: These are good American citizens, Jesse. Look what they did. I'm proud of them.WATTERS: Yes, I mean, you're right about the law. There's the Castle Doctrine where you can defend your home. They have open carry in that neighborhood.BONDI: That's right.WATTERS: They have stand your ground there. These were legally purchased weapons. They have the right of the Second Amendment to have these weapons to protect their property and to protect their life.What it looks like to me is this ridiculous District Attorney whose conviction rates just dropping like a rock. She is not getting anything done. She's actually just let looters and rioters off the hook, no charges at all.There she is right there. Her name is Kimberly Gardner. She's funded by George Soros. This just looks like a political play to me to win votes. But I wish I knew more about this. It's just clearly unconstitutional. I'm outraged by it.I mean, this is the United States of America, you have the right to bear arms.BONDI: Jesse, every American should be outraged by this, every single American. This is our most fundamental right and not only that, they are protecting themselves. These people are protecting themselves outside their own home on their own property.WATTERS: Right.BONDI: This isn't even close to being legal. He had no legal basis to go in and seize their firearm. What about the people who came in there armed? The couple said those people were armed. They are the ones who should be under investigation.Let me tell you, we dealt with a Soros funded attorney, a District Attorney or state attorney in Florida in Orlando, and he is now no longer running for office. He wasn't prosecuting cases the way he should have. But that's what happening. George Soros around this country is funding these political prosecutors.WATTERS: Yes. They are putting everyone in danger, and they're just shredding the Bill of Rights. I mean, this is the country was founded upon, some of these rights. And the government can't do that. It's just not right.All right, Pam, thank you.Up next, Last Call.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WATTERS: It's a big week for birthdays. On Thursday, I turned 21. That's right, I can drink now.

In response, Congress in March and April passed by overwhelming majorities and the president signed into law three main relief packages, and one supplemental measure, totaling nearly $3 trillion. The largest of the three bills was the CARES Act \u2013 which included one-time direct cash payments to many Americans, the expansion of unemployment benefits through the end of the year, and billions in loans and grants to small businesses through the Paycheck Protection Program.Many states \u2013 at the urging of the president \u2013 started relaxing their social distancing regulations and reopening the economy last month. But spikes in new coronavirus cases in three-dozen states the past couple weeks have forced many governors and mayors to put the brakes on, or even reverse, efforts to reopen the economy.Last month the Democratic-controlled House passed the HEROES Act, a massive $3 trillion stimulus package.

Put the guns down,\"CRYSTAL MCNEAL, MOTHER OF DAVON MCNEAL WHO WAS SHOT DEAD: They shot my baby in his head. He got shot in his head! It hurts so bad.(END VIDEO CLIP)GALLAGHER: The devastated family of this little boy. 11-year-old Davon McNeal senselessly gunned down this July 4th weekend in Washington DC. The sixth grader had dreams of playing in the NFL and his assistant principal says he was such a hard worker in school, he asked Davon to encourage his classmates to be more like him.He was shot dead on his way to a cookout Saturday organized by his mother Crystal as a way to bring the community together and combat violence. Tragically, Davon's death this weekend was not an isolated incident. These children also fatally shot in a violent weekend across the United States.In moments Davon's grandfather John Ayala will join us exclusively. And we will also speak to former NYPD Commissioner Bernie Kerik for a broader look at the crime surge in America tonight as major cities continue to see spikes in violence amid calls to defund the police.But let's begin tonight with Davon McNeal's grandfather John Ayala. He is also Founder of the DC chapter of the Guardian Angels, an organization that works with police to prevent crime. Sir, thank you so much for joining us and our hearts go out for the for the loss of your grandson Davon.JOHN AYALA, GRANDFATHER OF DAVON MCNEAL: Thank you for having me.GALLAGHER: I'm curious, sir, I know that your daughter-in-law Crystal McNeal spent - literally spends her life trying to settle these disputes between hardened criminals. And in the end, it cost her the life of her of her young son. What are your thoughts on what's happening in cities these days?AYALA: I think in cities you have a lot of people that just do not value life at this time. They don't realize that when you take a life that life is not coming back. It's not like TV, you take a life and the guy shows back up in another television show, or another movie. It's not a video game.People feel that if they have a dispute, the only way to handle it is with gun violence. I think we got to get out here and educate young people. More about why they shouldn't be picking up guns, why guns are so violent.And then, when you use a weapon and you actually take somebody's life, you're really not hurting that person emotionally. That person is gone. He's dead. The person that you're hurting is the family members that belongs to that person that you decided to take their life.GALLAGHER: Yes, I think it's a very strong point, sir. And you know, it's interesting because Davon's football coach, he was quoted as saying this. He said, you know, these kids, their lives are being robbed over nothing. And he's right, because last year, Davon's classmate - a classmate of Davon's last summer was also shot and killed. These children in these neighborhoods have got to be afraid to walk outside, sir.AYALA: Yes, I mean, not just last year. We have so many death of young people here in DC. We had another one that was high profile, Makiyah Wilson. She was a 10-year-old girl shot, I believe it was July 22, 2018. She just came out of her house to go get ice cream cone, and five guys jumped out of a vehicle and just started shooting. And she was shot and killed.And then a year later, there was another young man that was not too far away from that distance that was also shot and killed, and he was only 11 years old. And then you got Davon. You know, he gets out the car in front of his aunt's house. And the purpose for getting out the car was to get a charger, just to charge his phone, because the phone was dead. That's how he stays in contact with his other cousins.And he gets out the car. Shots ring. He hits the ground. Crystal's looking, saying get up man, he don't get up. So she goes - see what's going on and realize that he was hit with one of the bullets that were being shot, going in that direction, and she didn't realize it until she got over there.GALLAGHER: Yes, I mean, and these types of heart rending stories, sir, you know, there are at least five other families going through the very same thing right now. I want to put up this quote from Black Lives Matter DC and get your opinion on their side, because I know you're also in law enforcement.It says quoting here, \"That's our neighborhood. Your $533 million budget should be defunded, because you can't keep us our families safe. DC Police Department was around when this happened, as usual. We're beyond fed up with the blood in our streets. How dare you ask Mayor Bowser for more money meant for prevention?\"And I know we mentioned the top that you're had been involved in law enforcement and policing for much of your life. What do you respond to Black Lives Matter when they say things like that, sir?AYALA: OK. And you're right, most of my life I've been a Guardian Angel. I started doing this at the age of 14 in New York City. I came to DC and started the group when I was 19. I'm now 50. And 11 years ago I started a special police company called Archangel Global Security Special Police in Washington DC where we have full police powers. We are law enforcement on the properties that we work.Now for that response. I don't agree that we can't take money from the police department. We need the police. You take the police from there and we wind up having less police officers in the street, less detectives, it's not going to work. The crime is going to get worse.You need police to run those calls. So you just start having less police officers who are going to come when there is a need for police services. But what I will say, we have to find money for the additional services that everybody would like to have.There are calls that come into the police department that should not go to the police. These certain calls to go to other agencies that can deal with maybe mental health, or one of those calls when it comes to ticketing here in DC we have property where officers call - police call - special police or security are called for ticketing instead of calling the police. They can call a company that comes out and ticket cars.The money should go to those different agencies. Where can you get that money from? We have millions of dollars that are generated through red light cameras, speed cameras and other ways we receive money in, in the DC metropolitan area. Why can't we get money and just put it to those agencies?But to remove money from the police department, I think is not good. And also they spoke about taking police and some security out of the schools. That is a big mistake. I'd tell you that one time - I think, a couple of years ago they were talking about let's arm the teachers in the schools and these guys have no good training.But then now you want to take the police officers out of schools. I'm like, Are y'all serious?GALLAGHER: Yes.AYALA: What's going on? So we have another tragedy in the school, you're going to want to put the police back.GALLAGHER: And last thing, sir.AYALA: --You should not take the police out. The police need the funding.GALLAGHER: And I think it's a fair assessment. Lastly, you see, you hear about these crimes. And I know that there have been ceasefires in these neighborhoods over and over again, but they never hold. And you talk about the national spotlight on black crime. Do you believe, sir, that it's getting enough attention in this country?AYALA: I believe it is getting enough attention, it really have. But what I think we still need more organizations and more of us - when I say us, people in the black communities, to start going into the communities and talking to people to prevent the violence that are occurring.We are - also we need to go into the communities after there is something tragic as a shooting and mentor and talk to other young people in the community as well, so we can prevent it from happening in the future. Not just protests when a police officer hurts someone that looks like me.I agree we have to voice our opinion on it, because that's not right. That person should be arrested if he did something wrong. But there's always one bad apple in every organization. But we're going to go after the police officers when they hurt someone that look like me, we need to go after the people that look like me that hurt people that look like me, if you understand what I'm saying.GALLAGHER: I do. Very well said. Mr. Ayala, again, our hearts go out to you and your family for the loss of your grandson. We thank you so much for joining us tonight, sir.AYALA: Thank you for the opportunity.GALLAGHER: Also here tonight Bernard Kerik, former New York Police Commissioner. And Commissioner, I just want to put up this tweet that you sent out today and then you can kind of expound on that, if you would for us.You said, \"Look at their photos. Look really good.\" Speaking, of course of the five children who lost their lives around this country. \"Where are the black lives matter Marxists thugs and extortionists? They are funding the Democratic Party and DNC and those overseeing the cities where these kids were murdered.\" You want to expound on that for us, sir?And there is the picture. And we should look at these closely, because this happened this weekend - five. And there were six or seven, we believe, we are still working in getting their pictures up as well, sir. But your thoughts on what's happening across the country?BERNARD KERIK, FORMER NYPD COMMISSIONER: You know what, Trace, the black lives matter really matter to Black Lives Matter, the organization. You had seven - close to 80 people shot and 14 dead in Chicago. We had 44 shot, six dead in New York. 28 shot, four dead in Atlanta. 20 shot, three dead in Cleveland. I don't see no marches there. I don't see no protest. I don't see no screaming and yelling. I don't see anything for Black Lives Matter.There is a systemic slaughter of black on black members of communities all over the country that are led by Democrats. Those cities are led by Democrats. And if you go - and here's my point to the funding issue.If you go to the Black Lives organization website, and you donate money, it goes to ActBlue. And if you look ActBlue, it's a 501 3(c) that basically gives tens of millions of dollars to the Democratic Party. Where's that money going back to the communities where they oversee these cities that there's this systemic slaughter of blacks. It's got to stop.You know, you were talking to John about policing. The problem we have today, there ain't enough cops. There just aren't enough cops in these communities like Atlanta, like Chicago. There's not enough enforcement as it stands today, that's why you have these crime numbers. They need more resources. They need better manpower, more manpower, that's what they need.GALLAGHER: And we should know the city that you oversaw, crime recently up 205 percent and you have Mayor Bill de Blasio saying that this is part and parcel because of the coronavirus. Saying, quoting that \"the effects of people being cooped up too long.\" Your thoughts on that?KERIK: Delusional, that's what my thoughts are. He cuts 600 men and women out of the plainclothes anti-Crime Unit. That unit solely works on taking guns off the streets, responding to hot jobs, jobs in progress, violent crime in progress. That's what they were designated for. That's what they did. They're like chameleons in plainclothes where they can go into communities and look for guns and real bad guys. He took them off the streets and it's only going to get worse from this point forward, far worse.GALLAGHER: And Commissioner, I'm running low on time. But I think - I want to show this video, because I think it's worth it. This is surveillance video. It captured the moment a man was fatally shot while crossing a Bronx street on Saturday. He was hand in hand with his six-year-old daughter. He died, of course, the daughter is fine. But just, when you see something like this, it is unbelievable to have this happening on the streets of New York City.KERIK: Trace, this is broad daylight, number one. And number two, you know what, 30 years ago Rudy Giuliani and I and other police commissioners turned New York City into the safest large city in the world.Bill de Blasio has knocked it back 30 years - 30 years. Somebody - some things has to change. And I would urge the governor to wake up, stop washing his car or do whatever he's doing in Albany and get to New York City and fix it.GALLAGHER: Former NYPD Police Commissioner Bernie Kerik, good to see you, sir. I appreciate it.KERIK: Thank you.GALLAGHER: Well, a short time ago, Vice President Pence leading a Coronavirus Task Force meeting in the Situation Room as COVID cases rise in 32 states. Dr. Scott Atlas says the rising numbers are no cause for panic. And he's next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)GALLAGHER: Vice President Mike Pence convening a White House Coronavirus Task Force meeting late today amid a spike in New COVID-19 cases in 32 states. Texas and Florida, especially hard hit. Both hitting record case numbers over the holiday weekend. And Texas now setting a new record in hospitalizations as of tonight.White House Correspondent Kevin Cork is following the latest from Washington, Kevin?KEVIN CORKE, FOX NEWS WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Evening Trace. There is little doubt this is an administration effort to show that, yes, it is paying attention to this latest spike in cases by having more taskforce meetings.But it's also clear that at least for now, it is not on a wartime footing that should keep the country from reopening the economy, because as we've also heard the President say on a number of occasions, positive cases doesn't mean a spike in the death rate, and ultimately that is what is important.The Vice President talking about it in a tweet he said, there was a very good meeting of the White House Coronavirus Task Force today. He said, \"As we see cases rise in some areas, we are ensuring states have exactly what they need to respond to the increase. We'll continue to put the health of the American people first and we'll get through this together.\"That tweet, of course, coming after a barrage of tweets by the President today in which he described the expanded testing in our country is one of the principal reasons for the recent spike in cases. Also noting that the mortality rate continues to fall. Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany who was actually asked about that today at the White House press briefing.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)KAYLEIGH MCENANY, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: So what the President was pointing to, and I'm glad you brought it up, was a factual statement. One that is rooted in science and one that was pointing out the fact that mortality in this country is very low. No one wants to see anyone in this country contract COVID, which is why the administration has fought hard to make sure that's not the case with our historic response effort.(END VIDEO CLIP)CORK: And while it is true that the death rate continues to fall, the increase in hospitalizations, as you mentioned, is of great concern. In fact, so much so, that some states, including Texas, Florida, and Arizona had begun to roll back some of their relaxed restrictions. Trace?GALLAGHER: Yes. Indeed, they are. Kevin Cork live for us in Washington. Kevin, thank you.With us now, Dr. Scott Atlas. He's a Senior Fellow at Stanford University's Hoover Institution and former Chief of Neuroradiology at Stanford University Medical Center. Dr. Atlas, always good to see you. I'm curious, when you come out and you say that there is no reason to panic. What what's the premise for that, sir?SCOTT ATLAS, MD, SENIOR FELLOW, HOOVER INSTITUTION: Well, first of all, there's no reason to panic by any public official were they're disqualifying themselves from their position. But the data is what I want to talk about.And when we see this focus on more cases, it doesn't really matter how many cases. It only matters who gets the cases. Because we know the infection fatality rate for people under 70 is 0.04 percent on the latest analysis, that's less than or equal to seasonal flu. The cases themselves should not be and we're never the focus. It's only the tragic consequences of the cases.So when we look at these new cases in every state, the overwhelming majority are younger, healthier people. I think in Florida the median age is 36. In Texas, it's something similar or maybe 40. And that's really what we're thinking about here. Is that it only matters if we cannot protect the high risk people, which we are protecting.We're protecting - how do I know? Because the death rates are not going up. Actually, we realize we have to wait to have the story play out here. But right now, the cases have been going up for three weeks. We have no increase. In fact, we have a decrease in death rates. So, it doesn't matter if you get the illness if you're going to fully recover and be fine from it and that is what people must understand. For younger, healthier people, there's not a high risk from this disease at all.GALLAGHER: And it's interesting to me, because, you know, you talk about the death rate. And, you know, I know it's a lagging indicator, but a lot of these tests are lagging indicators. Some people are not getting their test results for 7, 8, 9 days. And so, these death rates are only lagging by a few days.In consistent, when you say the more cases that if they're getting younger people, it's a good thing. When the CDC comes out and says, 10 times the number of people who are - who have been confirmed to had COVID-19, that's probably the amount that had it. We applaud those numbers like that's a great thing, because that lowers the case fatality rate. But when we talk about new cases, everybody tends to panic a little bit.ATLAS: Well, and that's true. And I think that there's something else that goes on spoken. That is that when you have a lot of low risk people get the infection, that's how you generate population immunity. This is the so called herd immunity.People have been really mistaken about the number of people by the way that have had immunity, because immunity is not just based on antibodies. It's based on a larger number of people who had something called T cell immunity.But I do want to comment on the hospitalizations, because when you look more than superficially at data, which is necessary and should be demanded from our public health officials. When you look at Texas, for instance, yes, they have a lot of people in the hospital.But when I looked at every single hospital area in Texas today, 15 to 20 percent of people in the hospital as in-patients are COVID positive patients. That means 80 to 85 percent have nothing to do with COVID-19. And the same thing goes for some of these other states. There are people hospitalized a large number, because they're tested as COVID positive, somehow they're categorized as COVID hospitalizations. That's a problem.GALLAGHER: Yes. I'm it's interesting, because you're exactly right. When you see headlines in the Los Angeles Times, the Riverside County Hospital is 99 percent capacity. Then you read into the article, only 30 percent are COVID patients, it's a little misleading.I want to put these numbers on the screen, the Gallup poll, because it says that people are concerned. If you look at this, you get 19 percent are very worried about the lack of social distancing totaling 54 percent, because 35 percent are moderately worried. The case numbers go up, Dr. Atlas, and you say not to panic, but clearly we're doing something wrong.ATLAS: Well, what we're doing wrong is we have the wrong people in charge of our states, because they don't seem to understand it's not the superficial analysis that counts. And when they make the error that they should be beyond now of not consolidating the data in a critical manner, they need to communicate to people what the facts are. It's not a time to panic. It's not a high risk disease for people under 70. It's certainly not a high risk disease for people under 30 or 40, who almost all recover. So we have to look at that.And by the way, these policies of slight reopening in some of these states that does not even correlate time wise to these new cases. What correlates to the new cases, if it's from social mingling is the large protests that were in these large cities, somehow that goes unspoken. It's not the guy getting his hair cut in the barber shop that created all these thousands of cases. That's ridiculous.GALLAGHER: And the data is starting to lean that way. Dr. Scott Atlas, good of you to join us, sir. Thank you.ATLAS: OK, thank you.GALLAGHER: Well, President Trump tweeting today, \"China has caused great damage to the United States and the rest of the world.\" He's now weighing executive action to hold Beijing accountable for COVID's toll in the U.S. White House Trade Advisor Peter Navarro coming up right after this.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We got hit by the virus that came from China. China secrecy, deceptions, and cover up allowed it to spread all over the world 189 countries. And China must be held fully accountable.(END VIDEO CLIP)GALLAGHER: With more than 130,000 Americans lives lost and millions of others struggling to survive financially, President Trump could soon take action to hold China accountable for COVID-19 spread in the U.S.With us now on what that might look like, White House trade advisor, Peter Navarro. Sir, it's always good of you to join us.PETER NAVARRO, WHITE HOUSE TRADE ADVISER: Good evening, Trace.GALLAGHER: We see the president and the administration placing a lot of blame on China and people are beginning to wonder when the finger-pointing will stop and the consequences will start. Your thoughts?NAVARRO: Well, let's give it some historical context to understand what can and should be done. For the last 20 years, China has cheated in trade and Americans lost their jobs. Millions and millions and millions of jobs.President Trump was the first president to stand up to that and one of the primary ways he has been able to recover some of those damages and defend American workers is through his tough tariff policy. So, we got China cheats, American lose their jobs.In this case, what we have is the Chinese Communist Party line going back to November when they first span the virus in December and January when they hit the virus. December, January, February, when they were sending the virus around in aircraft to this country. So the CPP lied and so far over 130,000 Americans have died.GALLAGHER: Right.NAVARRO: And I think, Trace, what's really important is we've got a lot of anger, anxiety, and fear because of the China virus out there. It's being directed against each other but there is no -- there is no party affiliation on the death certificate. This is not a domestic battle.GALLAGHER: Right.NAVARRO: What we need to understand is that it's China, the Chinese Communist Party that is doing this to us. So what we do about that.GALLAGHER: Yes.NAVARRO: Well, first of all, let's take Hong Kong as a microcosm of that. For years, for years, we allowed China to use Hong Kong as a way to basically exploit our financial markets and steal our jobs by using it as a platform for trade practices.Soon, President Trump has already announced in May 29th in the Rose Garden we're going to strip every preferential treatment of Hong Kong away which will essentially eliminate China's ability to use Hong Kong to harm us --GALLAGHER: Right.NAVARRO: -- even as we're standing up for the great people of Hong Kong --(CROSSTALK)GALLAGHER: If we can -- if we can --NAVARRO: -- who are seeing (Inaudible)democracy --GALLAGHER: -- sir, get back to the consequences part of this whole thing. I'm curious as the consequences. Because White House --(CROSSTALK)NAVARRO: Well, it has a big consequence.GALLAGHER: -- chief of staff -- hold on one second, sir.NAVARRO: Yes.GALLAGHER: I apologize.NAVARRO: Sure.GALLAGHER: White House chief of staff Mark Meadows saying the president is going to, you know, implement some executive orders this week dealing with China, dealing with immigration and prescription drug prices. Will that executive order with China have an impact on the trade deal?NAVARRO: The trade deal remains intact according to Ambassador Lighthizer and Secretary Mnuchin. We're watching very, very carefully to see whether they fulfill the items there. And to be honest right now, the purchases are lagging but we believe that they will catch up by the end of the year if they keep their word.But this is, Trace, this is about a lot more than a trade deal, it wasn't merely a trade deal. It was about getting China to stop stealing our intellectual property, forcing technology transfer and things like that. And we know now that even as we speak, they're trying to steal the intellectual property for vaccine development for the China virus.So, again, I don't want to get ahead of the president or the chief of staff but there will be a series of actions taken over the next several weeks that will hold China accountable for the damage that it is doing to the American people. And don't forget, even as we speak, they are waging information warfare against this country trying to --(CROSSTALK)GALLAGHER: I got to go, sir.NAVARRO: -- sow these divisions.GALLAGHER: I got to go. But I want to quickly get your -- you're taking this on June 22nd you told this show the trade deal was over. You are asked, is it over? You said it's over. Is it over?(CROSSTALK)NAVARRO: I did not -- I did not say that, what I said that Trump in the Chinese Communist Party with respect to them was over so it's a case where we trust but we verify. And unfortunately --(CROSSTALK)GALLAGHER: Let me just --NAVARRO: -- that was as far spending went out on --GALLAGHER: Let me just play this for you, sir and then -- let me play you exactly what was said.NAVARRO: Well, as you play the tape --GALLAGHER: Let me play you exactly what was said. Go ahead, I'm going to play it back for you --NAVARRO: Sure.GALLAGHER: -- and you can listen to it and then respond.NAVARRO: Sure.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MARTHA MACCALLUM, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Do you think that the president sort of -- I mean, he obviously really wanted to hang onto this trade deal as much as possible. And he wanted them to make good on the promises because there had been progress made on that trade deal. But given everything that's happened and all the things you just listed, is not over?NAVARRO: It's over, yes.(END VIDEO CLIP)GALLAGHER: What --(CROSSTALK)NAVARRO: Clearly, was that the trust in the Chinese Communist Party is over. Going forward in this relationship, they cannot be trusted. We have to hold them accountable. And that's what we are going to be doing with this president, the toughest president on the Chinese Communist Party that we have ever seen.GALLAGHER: White House trade advisor, Peter Navarro, always good for you to join us, sir. Thank you.NAVARRO: Thank you, Trace.GALLAGHER: Well, Karl Rove and Chris Hahn on whether Kanye West presidential bid could spell bad news for Biden. Next.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: Can you answer this question? You're in the Oval Office.KANYE WEST, RAPPER: I'm here.TRUMP: How does it feel to be in the Oval Office?WEST: It is good energy in this.TRUMP: You feel good energy?WEST: It's a good energy.TRUMP: It's a great place.(END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)GALLAGHER: Well, Kanye West taking to Twitter on July 4th to announce he is running for president. It's at least the third time the rapper has done so over the past five years. And while the nearly impossible feat could be a publicity stunt, there is also speculation it's a plot to help President Trump get reelected.National correspondent Jacqui Heinrich has the story. Jacqui?JACQUI HEINRICH, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Trace, there's speculation over whether this is a legitimate run or a broader ploy to help either President Trump or former Vice President Joe Biden win. It's not the first time Kanye has floated the idea. In 2015 at the MTV Video Music Awards he said he would run in 2020. Then last year, he said he'd run in 2020 for possibly under the name of Christian genius billionaire Kanye West.But since his tweet Saturday Kanye has reportedly not filed with a federal election commission or created the campaign committee. Kanye has a friendly relationship with President Trump. He's been invited to the Oval Office where he said his MAGA hat makes him feel like superman.In 2018, he tweeted his love for the president defending his right to independent thought and saying they have dragon energy. And this past April he implied he would vote for the president. And there's been criticism Kanye's run would help President Trump's campaign like it's been argued Jill Stein's candidacy cost Hillary Clinton the election in 2016. Pulling significant enough support in swing states, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin.Critics also say he could siphon support away from former Vice President Joe Biden who is broadly supported by black voters. A YouGov/Huffington Post poll from 2015 showed 25 percent of black Americans said they would consider voting for Kanye.But a second poll from the same company three years later after Kanye began praising Trump showed a shift in public opinion with 9 percent of black American saying they had a favorable opinion of Kanye versus 20 percent of whites and 34 percent of Republicans. Lending credence to the converse theory that a Kanye run could pull support away from President Trump through possibly white and Republican supporters.But his first obstacle will be getting on the ballot. Kanye is also about to release a new album so there's also speculation that this is just a publicity stunt. Trace?GALLAGHER: Yes. Jacqui Heinrich live for us in New York. Jacqui, thank you.With us now, Karl Rove, former deputy chief of staff under President George W. Bush and Fox News contributor, and Chris Hahn, former aide to Senator Chuck Schumer and a syndicated radio host. Gentlemen, thank you both. Karl, I guess it's a point to be had. I mean, critics are saying look, any vote not for Joe Biden is a a vote for Donald Trump. So, there is a something to the whole Kanye West thing. Agreed?KARL ROVE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: No, there's not. This is a stunt. Look, he can't be on the ballot in North Carolina, Indiana, New Mexico, Texas. Those deadlines have already passed. In order to be on the ballot in Nevada he has to submit 9,608 signatures of Nevada voters by next Monday -- or excuse me, by Friday.Next week he has to get 160,000 signatures in Delaware, Florida, and Illinois to be on the ballot. In Michigan and New York by the end of the month he's got to get another 42,000 signatures.This is a stunt. He will not be filing this way with the Federal Election Commission. The only states that he runs a chance of being on the ballot are Oklahoma if he puts in $35,000 in cash by the 15th of the month or in August when he can pays -- he could pay $500 to get on the ballot in Louisiana and $1,000 to get in Colorado. This is a stunt and we are wasting people's time with it.GALLAGHER: Chris, you know, Karl makes a good point, Chris. Because the truth is, you know, he has spent zero time collecting signatures but a lot of time promoting this album and promoting his clothing line. Your thoughts?CHRIS HAHN, FORMER AIDE TO SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER: You know, it's been a couple of weeks since Karl and I have agreed fully but he is absolutely right. I even enjoyed watching him with his white board tonight which I don't normally do. So good work, Karl. I agree with you a 100 percent. This is a complete stunt.Kanye should stick to doing when he does best of making art. He is an artist. We've all enjoyed his work over the years. I don't enjoy his politics, and quite frankly, I think we are wasting time talking about it and it is absolutely a stunt. And we'll see how the album is, it might be pretty good.GALLAGHER: It might be pretty good. I mean, some of them have been fantastic. So, we have kind of taken off --HAHN: Yes.GALLAGHER: -- Kanye West for president. Let's move to vice president. Susan Rice as the V.P candidate gaining momentum, Karl?ROVE: Well, this is the point in which we talked about people and they gain momentum because we talked about them. Interesting from two angles, my perspective.One is in 20 -- in 2008, Joe Biden was sold in part as the vice- presidential running mate for Barack Obama because he had experience in foreign policy. Now we're talking about Susan Rice. Is she being talked about because she has experience with foreign policy that Joe Biden needs on the ticket? Interesting question.Second thing is, she's an accomplished individual. She is a serious person. And if she were chosen, she'd meet that standard that hard to define standard of, we think she's capable of doing the job if something bad happened to Biden. But she will inject, reinject a familiar issue into the race. She was the national security advisor for President Obama when Hunter Biden went on the board of Burisma.GALLAGHER: Yes.ROVE: And that same year Joe Biden was put in charge of anticorruption efforts on Ukraine. I've discussed this issue with her.GALLAGHER: Yes.ROVE: And she does not have a good answer. Did they know about Hunter Biden going on the board?HAHN: Well --ROVE: Did they have the White House any discombobulation? Did she have a conversation with Joe Biden and say you better do something about it? No good answer on any of this stuff.GALLAGHER: Right. And then there's Benghazi, Chris. The answer going on The Five the Sunday morning show saying it was all about an internet video. And then there's the Oval Office meeting in January of 2017 that involved Joe Biden and Comey. A lot of other questions at stake here. Your final thoughts, Chris?HAHN: There will be -- there will be nothing that stop Donald Trump from trying to bring Hunter Biden into this campaign. It will fail like just his campaign is going to fail. Just like he's failed America, just like he's failing on coronavirus and the economy.Look, whoever the Democrats pick our Joe Biden picks to be his running mate, they are going to be under serious attack by the right. So, buckle up. I think Susan Rice is a very accomplished person who would be an excellent vice president but there are a lot of people out there who would be an excellent vice president. And by August, we'll know.GALLAGHER: We will know. Chris Hahn, Karl Rove, gentlemen, good of you both. Thank you.HAHN: Thank you.ROVE: You bet.GALLAGHER: Well, Georgia Governor Brian Kemp declaring a state of emergency tonight after more than 20 people were shot and five killed in a single night including this little girl. Secoriea Turner, just eight years old and now her father is asking didn't her life matter?(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SECORIYA WILLIAMSON, SECORIEA TURNER'S FATHER: They say black lives matter. You killed your own. You killed your own this time.(END VIDEO CLIP)GALLAGHER: Jack Brewer and Wendy Osefo when THE STORY continues. Next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)GALLAGHER: Up to 1,000 National Guard troops are being deployed to keep the peace in Georgia where the governor has declared a state of emergency in response to a dramatic rise in violent crime. And the holiday weekend that saw more than 30 gunshot victims. One of them killed. Eight-year-old Secoriea Turner shot while in the car with her mother. And here is her father speaking out.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)WILLIAMSON: They say black lives matter. You killed your own. You killed your own this time. Just because of a barrier. They killed my baby because she crossed a barrier and made a U-turn. You killed a child. She didn't do nothing to nobody.(END VIDEO CLIP)GALLAGHER: Joining me now, Jack Brewer, former Minnesota Vikings player now CEO of the Brewer Group, and Wendy Osefo, founder and CEO of the 1954 Equity Project and professor of education at The Johns Hopkins University.Welcome to you both. I mean, that father sound bite is about as heartrending as it gets, Jack. You say -- you say that President Trump needs to get more involved in protecting the inner cities. How exactly, sir?JACK BREWER, CEO, THE BREWER GROUP INC.: It's time to federalize the National Guard. I mean, Eisenhower did it in 1955, JFK did it in 1962. I want every American to step back for a second and think about your town and city and think if you had 100 of your citizens, children, women, men, killed in shot on weekends.We knew this was going to happen. This has happened in Chicago in inner cities across this country and every Fourth of July. At what -- at what time is it? When is enough, enough? We call ourselves conservatives but then we just point a finger at poor Democratic leadership. We know they have poor leadership. We know they passed demonic satanic policies. That doesn't matter. Those are our brothers and sisters that are sitting in those communities. It's time for us to take a stand, and President Trump needs to do something now. This is a national crisis.GALLAGHER: Though critics point out that he got a lot of pushback when he talked about sending the National Guard and then militarizing after the protests. Wendy, I want your take on this. Because you say that, you know, black lives matter means that all black lives matter. And I'm curious if you think that the organization should have a bigger presence in places like Atlanta and Chicago where the black on black crime is growing exponentially at times?WENDY OSEFO, FOUNDER & CEO, 1954 EQUITY PROJECT: Black lives does matter, but you know, Trace, I want to be very clear and when you say black on black crime. Black people, yes, absolutely. When it comes to murder, they are more than likely to be killed by their fellow black man.However, white people when it comes to murder are more than likely to be killed by white people. So, if we are going to talk about black on black crime let's also talk about white on white crime because black on black crime is used as a strawman to deviate from the issue here.So, yes, black lives does matter. Black lives do matter, absolutely. But we cannot start to pull away from the movement by now trying to use black on black crime as a basic narrative. That little girl, that eight-year-old girl, her life mattered. What is going on in Atlanta cannot continue to go on.But those are two separate issues. America has multiple pandemics going on. We have people dying from police officers, we have coronavirus, and we have crime that happening amongst our citizens. But let's not conflate the two because black lives do matter.GALLAGHER: Yes. And you make a very fair point with a white on white crime as well, Wendy. And I want to bring in Jack on this. Because, Jack, you say the left has succeeded in manipulating the realities of our politics. And now it's time for conservatives to spread the word of God, to start spreading the word of God in this. And what do you mean by that, sir? Quickly, we're running low on time.BREWER: Amen. If you look, we've lost our fear of God that's why if you can go out and kill each other like we are seeing as a police officer roughly can step on the man's neck. We got to get back to spirituality and hold ourselves accountable. We keep talking about race. We need to be talking about one blood. That is what we celebrate here in America.And so, we all need to stand up against this. Again, look within ourselves. Conservatives, it's time to stop preaching hate and start talking about love. Even though we disagree with people who abort so many babies they don't protect the unborn, they don't protect the born, let's pray for them. They are our brothers and sisters too, that's the only way that we heal and move on as a nation as if we truly become one nation under God in Jesus name.GALLAGHER: Thank you. Wendy, the last word to you about 25 seconds.OSEFO: We have to make sure that whatever we're doing is going to move our nation forward and it's inclusive of all people. That means black people, that means trans people, that means the LGBTQQIA plus community. We have to move forward absolutely as one nation.GALLAGHER: Yes. Wendy Osefo, Jack Brewer, good conversation.

Good evening, welcome to Washington. I'm Bret Baier. Breaking tonight, President Trump dismisses the stories about intelligence assessments that Russia offered bounties for killing American troops in Afghanistan as a hoax and made up to hurt him and the Republican Party. The President's National Security Adviser is saying today he had a list of retaliatory options if the intelligence had been corroborated. I will ask Secretary of State Mike Pompeo about this story, many other topics around the world in just a few minutes. But first to the lead story from the White House tonight, we begin tonight with Correspondent Kristin Fisher live on the North Lawn. Good evening, Kristin. KRISTIN FISHER, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT: Good evening, Bret. Today for the first time since The New York Times broke the story on Friday, President Trump talked about it on camera and he said if Russia did offer bounties to kill U.S. troops in Afghanistan, he would take action. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I agree with the intelligence people. I think frankly that many of the intelligence people didn't think it was something that even happened. And if it did happen, the Russians would hear about it, and anybody else would hear about it that was involved. FISHER: Today the National Security Adviser confirmed that the intelligence behind to these Russian bounties was shared with U.S. allies. And he pinned the responsibility for the decision to not share that intelligence with President Trump on the President's daily briefer, a career CIA officer. ROBERT O'BRIEN, NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER: She made that decision because she didn't have confidence in the intelligence that came up. She made that call and you know what? I think she made the right call. FISHER: But Democrats disagree. They believe intelligence of this magnitude should have made its way to the president. (INAUDIBLE) as The New York Times and associated press recording, then Democratic Senator Joe Manchin says, not only did the president, quote, fail our service members, but he broke his oath to protect and defend the constitution. It would be unconscionable to think he did not immediately inform Putin that America would retaliate in the most damning way possible. The New York Times is now claiming to have found the money trail behind these bounties to kill U.S. troops in Afghanistan. The paper reports, American officials intercepted electronic data showing large financial transfers from a bank account controlled by Russia's military intelligence agency to a Taliban-linked account. But Defense Secretary Mark Esper says, the Pentagon has no corroborating evidence at this time. Adding, I want to assure all of our service members that we take seriously any and all potential threats against U.S. military personnel. Today, Democratic Senator Bob Menendez introduced an amendment to the Defense Authorization Act to sanction Russian President Vladimir Putin and other top government officials. But the Kremlin calls the claims total B.S. and so does President Trump. TRUMP: I think it's a hoax by the newspapers and the Democrats. (END VIDEOTAPE) FISHER: Now lawmakers from both parties have been calling for a briefing about all of this from people within the intelligence community, not the White House. And tomorrow morning, the Gang of Eight is going to get one from the director of National Intelligence and the director of the CIA, Bret. BAIER: Yes, and the Secretary of State with us in just a moment. Kristin, thank you. The House of Representatives passed a bill to sanction China over their new national security law for Hong Kong. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi saying the purpose of that law is to frighten and suppress peaceful demonstrators demanding freedom. Thousands of protesters defied the law and tear gas on the anniversary of the former British colonies handover to Chinese rule. Hong Kong police responded with the first arrests under the new law. Correspondent Benjamin Hall is following this story from London. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BENJAMIN HALL, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT: Hong Kong police cracked down today both on protesters and free speech. Police fired rubber bullets as they enforce the new security law which gives sweeping powers to China to arrest people for criticizing the government. As crowds marks 23 years since the end of British rule, police held up signs warning of the new law then arrested people who called for Hong Kong independence, or even displayed the British flag. The law is applied to nonresidents and those abroad, meaning it could affect Americans. Carrie Lam, the Chief Executive of Hong Kong tried to defend it. CARRIE LAM, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF HONG KONG: The purpose of this piece of legislation is not just to punish, but it's also to deter. HALL: The U.S. is responding by moving to end special trade terms with Hong Kong and banning defense exports. With Congress moving to impose sanctions on Chinese officials who try to repress political freedoms. The U.K. is extending residency rights and citizenship to up to three million Hong Kongers. And British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has condemned the law. BORIS JOHNSON, PRIME MINISTER OF THE UNITED KINGDOM: It violates Hong Kong's high degree of autonomy and is in direct conflict with Hong Kong basic law. The laws also threatens the freedoms and rights protected by the joint declaration. HALL: The new law is punishable by up to life in Chinese prison. And China will now be allowed to establish security officers in Hong Kong, which means Chinese security forces operating freely on the island. (END VIDEOTAPE) HALL: Observe this note, this new law is a violation of the agreement made with Britain. Effectively the end of the one country, two-systems framework. The end of Hong Kong's autonomy, Bret. BAIER: Benjamin Hall in London. Benjamin, thank you. Federal authorities seized tons of products suspected to be made out of human hair taken from people locked inside Chinese internment camp. U.S. Customs and Border Protection says the goods represent a serious human rights violation. State Department Correspondent Rich Edson has an exclusive television report. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) RICH EDSON, FOX NEWS CHANNEL STATE DEPARTMENT CORRESPONDENT: In this nearly 13-ton shipment seized in New York, hair weaves and extensions from China. The U.S. officials suspect they're made from human hair. Customs official say they're still analyzing the origins of this cargo, though intercepted it based on information indicating prison labor in Xinjiang, China produced it. KEN CUCCINELLI, ACTING DEPUTY SECRETARY, DHS: It is our intention to keep interdicting shipments like the one you saw today in New York that CBP grabbed. We will keep doing that over and over and over. No American wants to buy a product that they find out later was made with slave labor. EDSON: The spokesman for the National Security Council says, quote, if this highly suspicious, 13-ton shipment of human hair indeed turns out to be linked to the Uyghur concentration camps, then this is a new low, even for the Chinese Communist Party. And they will have to answer to the world community for their actions. Officials say the administration is expanding pressure on businesses operating in the United States, urging them to rid their supply chains of products manufactured with forced labor. The federal government has issued an advisory to companies, warning them to monitor their activities in China. MIKE POMPEO, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: CEOs should read this notice closely and be aware of the reputational, economic and legal risks of supporting such assaults on human dignity. EDSON: The notice specifically references Xinjiang, China where officials say the Chinese government has interned more than one million Muslims and minorities like Uyghurs. Subjecting them to surveillance, indoctrination, and forced labor. Last month, President Trump told Axios he held off on sanctioning Chinese officials involved with the Xinjiang mass detention camps because it would have interfered with his trade deal with China. (END VIDEOTAPE) EDSON: But the president has also signed a law directing sanctions against Chinese government officials who were involved in the mass internment camps in Xinjiang. U.S. officials say that Chinese government has located hundreds of thousands of prisoners from those camps to factories across China, Bret. BAIER: Rich Edson live from the state department. Rich, thank you. For more on China, Hong Kong and America's role in the world, joining me now Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Mr. Secretary, thanks for being here. POMPEO: Bret, thanks for having me on this evening. Great to be with you again. BAIER: We just heard you talked about the companies -- American companies warning them to keep forced labor, labor out of their supply chains pointing directly at China and these concentration camps as descried by the Defense Department. Will we see investigations and prosecutions of American businesses who don't heed this warning? POMPEO: Bret, President Trump has been very clear, the way previous administrations have dealt with the Chinese Communist Party by turning the other cheek and letting them abuse America is not going to continue, so we responded across a number of fronts. So you identify one, this forced labor, nobody wants to buy products -- cheap products that were made with slave labor in Western China. They want clarity about the tracing of the product that they have. And so we've asked every business to evaluate their supply chain and make sure that nothing like that ever gets in, and we put them on notice for actions that we may take as we move forward. BAIER: You know, last month, President Trump told Axios that he held off sanctions -- sanctioning Chinese officials involved with the mass detention camps because it would have interfered with his trade deal with China. Should those have been separated? POMPEO: Bret, I've been Secretary of State for 2-1/2 years, no, there's always complex tradeoffs that one has to make. President Trump's been very clear when he signed this bill, the Uyghur bill last week that we were going to take this seriously, we were going to deal with it, we were going to put harsh restrictions in place, we're working on that. No country has responded in the same way that we have. We hope the whole world will join. What's going on there Bret, is historic, there's forced sterilization, forcing women to have abortions, this is a place with some of the most fundamental violations of human rights that the world has seen in an awfully long time. President Trump's been serious about making sure the world sees. And so we hope that countries all across the world, including Muslim countries in the world will see their way clear to putting their shoulder to the grindstone to help resolve this problem as well. BAIER: I guess the question is should the president had done more in a lot of opportunities talking with President Xi? POMPEO: There's no country that has done more, and I'm confident will do more, Bret. BAIER: All right, in Hong Kong, you -- we did a story there about the new security law in place. You've certified that Hong Kong is no longer sufficiently autonomous. Again, should the administration have acted more forcefully to deter Chinese crackdown in Hong Kong? POMPEO: I'll tell you, Bret, I wish previous administration had taken China seriously. It's true, well, this isn't partisan, 40 years of failed American policy with respect to China. This administration is trying to clean it up, trying to get it right. Now the Chinese have taken advantage of us -- advantage of us in multiple ways. We've done really good work, important work trying to protect the freedoms of the people of Hong Kong. General Secretary Xi has chosen to go a different direction, and we're responding in a way that will put pressure on Beijing, and try to maintain whatever we can of the remaining freedoms in Hong Kong. I will tell you the notion that the remains, one country and two systems is fundamentally at odds with the facts on the ground today. I regret that. BAIER: You know that your critics including now John Bolton say that this is all about election politics and to get China to buy soybeans and places that affect reelection. POMPEO: Nonsense. BAIER: OK, that's what we get from that. What does success look like with China, the U.S. and China? What does it look like? Can China be a responsible partner with President Xi at the helm in the Chinese Communist Party? POMPEO: Look, that's up to the Chinese Communist Party, that's their decision to make. What the United States can control is what we do. When there's unfair and nonreciprocal trade, we're going to demand by -- demand that it be right. When they don't do, we're going to do things like placing tariffs on their goods. When they engage in behavior that's militarily threatening to the United States, we're going to put $700 billion into our Department of Defense to keep Americans safe and secure. And when the Chinese engage in cyber espionage, we're going to impose penalties on them so that they will be deterred from doing that. Those are the things we can do. We are hopeful, we want the Chinese people to be successful. The Chinese Communist Party today has made a decision, it wants to be an imperialist power, it wants to be authoritarian in nature and it wants to compete across the world in ways they are consistent with the good things happening for the American people. And frankly, people with democracies all across the world. Presidents Trump's policies are aimed squarely at reversing that. BAIER: I want to spend some time on the Russia bounty story in Afghanistan. First, does the Russian government have American blood on its hands in Afghanistan? POMPEO: Bret, I don't want to get into the intelligence. The intelligence community has put out two statements. I used to have that job; I'm going to -- I'm going to honor what they said. Here's what I can say with absolute certainty, the United States has responded appropriately to the threats that have been presented to it in Afghanistan consistently during my entire 3-1/2 half years. First the CIA director and now as Secretary of State, there are many folks using the Taliban or who have used the Taliban over years and years and years as proxy forces. There's been money funneled in there from all across the world, unfortunately. President Trump has taken this seriously, we are hopeful, we'll make progress on our peace and reconciliation plan. And we will respond to any threat, whether that's Iranians using the Taliban or the Russians, we'll make sure they know. The Russians have been providing weapons to the Taliban for an awful lot of years, and so, this is an ongoing challenge we have. And our forces on the ground under General Miller and the resolute support mission are deeply aware of the threat from the Taliban whether that's supported by any third party or none. BAIER: But you know, you just referenced you were CIA director, there's not often consensus across the intelligence community on Intel. And if it dealt with bounties killing American troops, shouldn't the president have been told about it? We know that it was discussed in the National Security Council, the principles and deck this level. You said today the key members of Congress had that Intel as well, even though there wasn't a consensus. Why wasn't the president briefed on it? POMPEO: Well, Bret, that's not actually quite right. Most intelligence that's red -- there is in fact a consensus. Almost all of the analytical product that I read every day has a consensus across the entire intelligence community. It is often the case that it is not that happens. When that happens, we need to make sure we get it right. But Bret you know this, every morning I wake up, and I read the intelligence materials. And when I read them, there are people all across the world who are threatened, including my officers and embassies all across the world. We don't always make sure that gets to the president, we do the right thing. We make sure the ambassador on the ground knows, that the commander on the ground knows, that our allies who may be threatened as well know. It is the tactical and operational response to keep our soldiers safe and secure that is most important. When the intelligence community feels like something rises to the level of needs to get to the president, I'm very confident they will consistently present it to them. I know that when I was the CIA director, I did that. BAIER: Did you know about this particular Intel piece? POMPEO: You know, I don't want to talk about the Intel in particular on this, Bret. BAIER: All right. POMPEO: I mean, there's just -- I just -- I'm not trying to be clever, there's just so much that has been reported that is not accurate and that is incomplete that by refuting any particular element of it. I'm putting at risk our capacity to actually resolve and figure out what's going on. BAIER: And I want to ask you about that in the leak itself, but here is what the democratic nominee is saying about it. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: He either reads and/or gets briefed on important issues and he forgets it, or he doesn't think it's necessary that he need to know it. He should have a minimum, have picked up the phone and said, Vladimir, old buddy, if any of this is true, and it doesn't cease amigo, you've got a big problem. (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: All right, so, it's not just the Democrats, obviously, you have Senator Chuck Grassley on the Senate floor, saying it demands a serious response. You have two key Republicans in the House. Mike McCaul and Adam Kinzinger, saying, \"There are already those who are politicizing this issue. However, we cannot use let politics overshadow the truth that Republicans and Democrats alike can agree on: The Putin regime cannot be trusted. If the intelligence review process verifies the report, we strongly encourage the administration to take swift and serious action to hold the Putin regime accountable.\" POMPEO: Yes. Bret, there's been no administration to hold the Russians accountable the way this one has. I only wish former Vice President Biden had held the Russians accountable. We've been cleaning up a lot less of a mess. I wish we provided arms to the Ukrainians, I wish he had gotten out of the INF Treaty, I wish he hadn't allowed and invited the Syrians -- the Russians into Syria. I could go on, but you got a short show. The failures of previous administration allowed the Russians a lot of space to move. We've pushed back, we sanctioned more Russians than any other administration in history. I'll take a backseat to no one with respect to what our administration and President Trump has done to hold Vladimir Putin accountable when he is engaged in malign activity. And should we find out that there's evidence that he's putting our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines at risk, anywhere in the world, including in Afghanistan, I am very confident that President Trump will direct me, and he himself will respond appropriately. BAIER: How damaging was this leak? You were CIA Director, the White House press secretary the other day, said that there were rogue officers in the intelligence community who want to undercut the president. You believe that? POMPEO: Bret, I don't know where this leak came from. But when periodicals report this information, it breaks my heart because it puts our intelligence officers and our military men and women at risk. It is -- it is dangerous, it is unlawful, and I hope that we can figure out who did it, and they'll be brought to justice. BAIER: Mr. Secretary, you did speak out when it was alleged that Iran was paying the Taliban $1,000 for each American killed in Afghanistan, as a member of Congress, and you, spoke out about the Obama administration's response at the time, which obviously you criticize in the overall Iran deal. POMPEO: Yes, it's absolutely true. I've spoken about the Iranians providing assistance to the Taliban in my current role as secretary of state as well. I've criticized other governments. We've worked to make sure Pakistan wasn't providing safe haven for the Taliban in Afghanistan too. No, where equal opportunity when it comes to making sure we protect the Americans wherever they're serving. BAIER: All right, let's talk about the couple of other substantive things. One, as you mentioned, the Taliban peace deal. You said that the Taliban would publicly renounce al-Qaeda. You talked about that, I asked you about it back in March. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: It says it will not allow any of its members or other individuals or groups, including al-Qaeda to use the soil of Afghanistan to threaten the security of the United States and its allies. But that's not really a break. That's not a renouncing -- POMPEO: Oh, yes. Oh, yes. BAIER: A renouncing of al-Qaeda? POMPEO: Absolutely. Absolutely, when you say you're not going to let them operate there, you know it, Bret. They've done it for 20 years. They're not going to let them operate it anymore. That's -- that is a central provision. (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: You went further saying that they would eventually take up arms and fight al-Qaeda, working alongside us to destroy al-Qaeda. Have you seen any indication that the Taliban is doing any of that? POMPEO: Yes. BAIER: How? POMPEO: But I can't talk about the things that I have seen, but know this, I spoke with the Taliban, again, just this week and effort to further the peace negotiations to try and get them to the table with the Afghan government. I think we're closer than we were even just a couple of weeks back. The Taliban continued to have pressed upon them the importance of this break from al-Qaeda, and I think we will be able to see when we get to that point, when we have these negotiations commenced, I think the world will be able to see that the Taliban are no longer going to tolerate what they've permitted to happen and that the Pakistanis too will do the things that need to be done to reduce the footprint from al-Qaeda. Remember, Bret, we're down to a couple of 100 active al-Qaeda fighters inside of Afghanistan. The reason we went there in 2001 was to crush al- Qaeda. That has largely been achieved. BAIER: Can you confidently state that America will have U.S. troops in Afghanistan on Election Day? POMPEO: President will ultimately make that decision, Bret. BAIER: OK. One more thing, the E.U. blocking travelers from the U.S. due to the coronavirus pandemic. Your reaction to that, and is there any pushback from the U.S.? POMPEO: Well, remember, we're not allowing Europeans to come here today, either, Bret. We're in close conversation with countries all around the world, including European countries, to make sure that when we reopen our country to travel from their nations. That we do so in a way that keeps American people safer and reduces risk from COVID here in the United States. They have a responsibility to do that for their nations as well. And I'm very confident that we'll get this right with countries all across the world. It's not just the Europeans, we need to get this right, we need to get the economy back up, when you get people traveling all across to the United States, and international travel as well. BAIER: Mr. Secretary, we appreciate your time. POMPEO: Thank you, Bret. BAIER: Happy Independence Day, early. POMPEO: Thank you. Happy Fourth of July to you too, Bret. BAIER: All right, all the best. Up next, California and New York become the latest states to halt the process of reopening. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BAIER: Private payroll processor ADP, found U.S. companies added nearly 2.4 million jobs in June, with small businesses reporting the biggest increase. According to the data, the economy still has about 14 million fewer jobs than it did in February. President Trump is back in more stimulus as part of the recovery from coronavirus, telling Fox Business, he is not -- he not only favors more payments to individuals, but he wants them to be even larger than the first time around. Stocks started the third quarter of 2020 on a mixed note. The Dow dropped 78. The S&P 500 gained 16, and a record high closed for the NASDAQ which finished ahead 96. Here in Washington, the Fourth of July fireworks show will go on with the Trump administration promising one of the largest displays ever. 300 000 masks will be given away on the National Mall. But attendees will not be required to wear them. Other states are pausing the reopening process and mandating masks. Correspondent Jonathan Serrie, looks at the coronavirus trends across the country. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JONATHAN SERRIE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Alarmed by an increase in coronavirus cases, California's governor has announced a three-week closure of bars and restaurant dining rooms. While the mayor of New York City has postponed plans to reopen in restaurant dining. BILL DE BLASIO, MAYOR OF NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK: The news we have gotten from around the country gets worse and worse all the time. SERRIE: Public health officials say large Memorial Day gatherings and complacency over the use of face masks are driving the nation's new spike in COVID-19 cases. Today, an emergency order in Savannah, Georgia, imposed a $500 fine on people who failed to wear face coverings in public. Doctors at Emory University, say mandates are more effective than recommendations based on their own experience in hospitals. JONATHAN LEWIN, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, EMORY HEALTHCARE: When we simply strongly encouraged face masks, we still saw community spread. When we required masks, we saw our infection rates within our workforce plummet. SERRIE: Following a lot of criticism today, President Trump, explained he usually doesn't wear a mask because people who visit the president are tested. DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: If I were in a tight situation with people, I would absolutely be -- (CROSSTALK) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Do you think the public will see that at some point? TRUMP: I mean, I'd have no problem. Actually, I had a mask and I said I like the way I looked. SERRIE: Although the U.S. leads the world and confirm COVID-19 cases, its deaths per 100,000 population remain among the lowest. However, health experts say that's not reason for complacency. DR. CARLOS DEL RIO, PROFESSOR OF MEDICINE, EMORY UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE: I worry less about the numbers right now, and I worry more about the trend. And the fact that we're seeing an exponential growth is really what bothers me right now, and what really makes me very concerned. (END VIDEOTAPE) SERRIE: Public health officials are especially concerned about the upcoming Fourth of July holiday when many people are planning get-togethers, they're urging people to limit the size of gatherings, and to wear face coverings when social distancing is not possible. Bret. BAIER: Jonathan Serrie in Atlanta. Jonathan, thank you. Up next, the end of the chop zone in Seattle and budget cuts for the NYPD. First, here is what some of our Fox affiliates around the country are covering tonight. FOX 4 in Kansas City, where you, the American taxpayer have an almost 30 percent stake in a trucking company that ships military equipment. The Treasury Department will loan YRC worldwide $700 million in exchange for a stake in the company. Congress gave permission to the deal as a way to ensure taxpayer money is not misspent. FOX 7 in Austin, Texas where the U.S. army says partial human remains have been found close to the Leon River in Bell County. In the search for missing Fort Hood soldier Vanessa Guillen. 20-year-old Guillen was last seen on April 22nd, a family attorney says one suspect committed suicide as police closed in on them. Another suspect is in custody. And this is a live look at San Francisco from our affiliate FOX 2 out there. One of the big stories there tonight. Police, say they will stop making mug shots publicly available unless the person poses a threat to the public. The police chief, says the move is part of an effort to stop perpetuating racial stereotypes and protect the presumption of innocence. That's tonight's live look \"OUTSIDE THE BELTWAY\" from SPECIAL REPORT. We'll be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BAIER: In downtown Seattle, the Capitol Hill Organized Protest zone, or CHOP, is no more. Police cleared the area after the mayor declared it an unlawful assembly following two deadly shootings in less than two weeks there. Correspondent Dan Springer reports. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DAN SPRINGER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Acting on the mayor's executive order signed overnight, police officers and FBI agents moved into the area known as CHOP just before 5:00 a.m. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We need to be clear now. If we don't clear out then we'll be forced to arrest. SPRINGER: While most peacefully left, police, some in riot gear, did arrest at least 30 people for offenses including failure to disperse, assault, and unlawful weapon possession. CARMEN BEST, SEATTLE POLICE CHIEF: What has happened here on these streets is lawless, and it's brutal, and bottom line, it is simply unacceptable. SPRINGER: Established in early June in the wake of George Floyd's death, what was initially an overwhelmingly peaceful protest soon became linked to incidents of violence. Black Lives Matter and similar groups had already pulled out, and there was now concern from both protesters and the city that CHOP's original message, a call for police reform, has been drowned out. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We're going to have to work 10 times as hard to get our message back on track. BEST: Black Lives Matter, and I too want to help propel this movement forward, but enough is enough. (END VIDEOTAPE) SPRINGER: Seattle police are back inside the east precinct which they abandoned in early June. The question now is how long they will hold and keep it from becoming of point again as protestors say the idea of CHOP isn't over yet. Bret? BAIER: Dan Springer in Seattle. Dan, thanks. Just after midnight early this morning, New York City's City Council passed the city's $88 billion budget that includes $1 billion in cuts to the NYPD. But that has not resulted in the end of Occupy City Hall protesters. Correspondent Aishah Hasnie looks at the situation in the big apple today. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: As hereby adopted as of 12:26 p.m. -- AISHAH HASNIE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: With ah historic vote, New York City leaders defunded the NYPD's $6 billion budget by close to $1 billion. The 2021 budget cuts include cutting the number of recruits in half, which would save $40 million, and a reduction on police overtime spending by $352 million. And it comes at a time when shootings are up across the city compared to this time last year. The city faces a $9 billion loss due to coronavirus, and police retirements are rising. DERMOT SHEA, NEW YORK CITY POLICE COMMISSIONER: Let's mark the date on the calendar and how long it's going to be before we'll have that conversation about New Yorkers crying out for more police. HASNIE: But some protesters outside city hall and council members feel the budget did not go far enough. They wanted to eliminate school safety officers and introduce a hiring freeze on police. JONATHAN LYKES, BLACK YOUTH PROJECT 100: We're not happy with the budget, let me be clear. We know that they political tricks. HASNIE: Mayor Bill de Blasio said he will continue to support peaceful protests, but the city needs to move forward now. Protesters, though, have a different message for their mayor. LYKES: We're coming for you. We're going to escalate tactics. We're going to be disruptive. (END VIDEOTAPE) HASNIE: And that very same organizer tells me the people in charge of organizing Occupy City Hall will leave now that the budget has passed, but they will continue to support anyone who wants to stay. Bret? BAIER: Aishah, thank you. Up next, the battle over our nation's history ahead of the holiday weekend. First, Beyond our Borders tonight. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announcing a delay in the annexation of parts of the occupied West Bank. The process was supposed to begin today, and still may take place later this month. Several thousand Palestinians peacefully marched in Gaza City to protest those plans. Russian voters approved a package of constitutional changes allowing President Vladimir Putin to serve two more terms, possibly staying in power until 2036. The weeklong vote was tarnished by reports of pressure on voters and other irregularities. Putin, who has been in power more than two decades, did not mentioning his political future during a speech Tuesday and has yet to commit to running to 2024 when his current term expires. And way Beyond our Borders, NASA astronauts replaced batteries on the outside of the International Space Station today. For every two batteries removed, a new one and improved one is installed to power the station while on the night side of the earth. The battery replacement process began in 2017 and should be completed this month. Just some of the other stories beyond our border tonight. We'll be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BAIER: In our Democracy 2020 report, Oklahoma voters narrowly approved a state constitutional amendment to expand Medicaid health coverage to tens of thousands of low-income residents. Oklahoma is the first state to amend its constitution to expand Medicaid. For other states accomplished it through ballot questions. In Colorado, five-term Congressman Scott Tipton lost his Republican primary contest to pro-gun and pro-border wall candidate Lauren Boebert. She will run in November against Diane Mitsch Bush who won the Democratic primary in the district. The Colorado Senate race, meantime, set as well. Former governor John Hickenlooper won the Democratic primary against a progressive opponent and will face Republican incumbent Senator Cory Gardner. The mayor of Richmond, Virginia, the former capital of the Confederacy, has ordered to removal of all Confederate statues standing on city land. This afternoon the of Stonewall Jackson on Richmond's Monument Avenue came down to the cheers of a surrounding crowd. The move comes at a time when the fight over Confederacy symbols takes center stage on Capitol Hill. Congressional correspondent Chad Pergram has the story. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) CHAD PERGRAM, FOX NEWS PRODUCER: Pageantry and imagery defined most Fourths of July. This holiday could ignite flashpoints around the nation's uncomfortable history. There's concern demonstrators could again try to topple controversial statues. KAYLEIGH MCENANY, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: Law and order are the building blocks to the American dream. Anarchy in our streets is unacceptable. PERGRAM: The Department of Homeland Security is deploying special teams to protect federal monuments in Portland, Oregon, and Washington, D.C. President Trump warned people his executive order to safeguard monuments is in full force. That prompted a veto threat of the Senate's annual defense bill if lawmakers stand by a plan to rename bases named after Confederates. SEN. JAMES INHOFE (R-OK), SENATE ARMED SERVICES COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN: He's serious about it. You know the president. He makes up his mind, and he does things. SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER, (D-NY) SENATE MINORITY LEADER: This is nothing but typical bluster from President Trump. At the NDAA will pass. PERGRAM: Still, this bill may not go to the president to sign until fall. SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL, (R-KY) SENATE MAJORITY LEADER: I hope the president would reconsider vetoing the entire defense bill, which includes pay raises for our troops, over a provision in there that could lead to changing the names of some of these military bases. PERGRAM: But members of the Congressional Black Caucus aren't convinced some changes are truly for racial justice, such as Mississippi's decision to mothball its flag with the Confederate emblem. SEN. BENNIE THOMPSON, (D-MS) CONGRESSIONAL BLACK CAUCUS: When SEC, NCAA, the bankers, the richest man in the state who was a Trump delegate said we need to change the flag, boom, it changed. (END VIDEOTAPE) PERGRAM: President Trump believes the culture war over monuments works politically in his favor, but Democrats think that Black Lives Matter tilts the field in their direction. That's why fights over statues and military bases represents a proxy war ahead of November. Bret? BAIER: Chad Pergram live on the Hill. Chad, thanks. Next up, the panel reacts to my interview with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and the big stories around the world, next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: Does the Russian government have American blood on its hands in Afghanistan? MIKE POMPEO, SECRETARY OF STATE: Bret, I don't want to get into the intelligence. The United States has responded appropriately to the threats that have been presented to it in Afghanistan consistently. There are many folks using the Taliban, or who have used the Taliban over years and years and years as proxy forces. I don't know where this leak came from, but when periodicals report this information, it breaks my heart, because it puts our intelligent officers and our military men and women at risk. It is dangerous, it is unlawful, and I hope that we can figure out who did it, and they'll be brought to justice. (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: Secretary of State Mike Pompeo talking about that Russia bounty story in Afghanistan. We'll start there with our panel, Ben Domenech, publisher of \"The Federalist,\" Mara Liasson, national political correspondent for National Public Radio, and Josh Holmes, former top advisor to Mitch McConnell, now president of Cavalry Consultants. Ben, thoughts on his answer, and the story overall. BEN DOMENECH, \"THE FEDERALIST\": First off, I think his answer was as clarifying as he possibly could be in this moment, which is clearly, there's a big muddle here about where this intelligence came from, why it was leaked in the way that it was, and what we are supposed to take away from this situation overall. He is correct that the Taliban has been used as a proxy force in all sorts of different ways. It does seem like this story came out in a way that would undermine the efforts of American forces to figure out what was actually going on in this scenario, and coming at the truth. But I think that that's probably going to lead to a discovery that leads to an indication that this was trying to do something that undermined the president and undermined his overall efforts in the region. BAIER: Clearly the president think so, said it on FOX Business. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, (R) PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: When you bring something into a president, and I see many, many things. And I'm sure I don't see many things that they don't think rose to the occasion. This didn't rise to the occasion. And from what I hear, and I hear it pretty good, the intelligence people, many of them didn't believe it happened at all. I think it's a hoax. I think it's a hoax by the newspapers and the Democrats. (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: Mara? MARA LIASSON, NATIONAL POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, NATIONAL PUBLIC RADIO: Yes, well, Secretary Pompeo didn't say it was a hoax. He was angry that it leaked, I understand that, but I guess the question now is, is this real or not? Did the Russians but a bounty on U.S. troops? And what does the president want to do about it, if anything? So I think that's the next chapter of this. They're going to try to find out who leaked it, that's kind of one problem. But the other one is, if it's true, what is the administration going to do? BAIER: Josh, the national security advisor spoke about the CIA briefer. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ROBERT O'BRIEN, NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER: The person who decided early on whether the president should be briefed on this in Oval intelligence briefing was his career -- senior career civil servant CIA officer. And she made that decision because she didn't have confidence in the intelligence that came up. She made that call. And you know what, I think she made the right call. (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: So there's all kinds of people speculating, did they not want to bring it to President Trump because of what he would think about it, would he tweet about it, would he talk to President Putin in some way, shape, or form about it? That's not what they're saying, Josh. JOSH HOLMES, CAVALRY CONSULTANTS: No, they're not saying that at all. What they're saying is that the CIA and the intelligence services concluded that it wasn't ready for primetime, that in fact it wasn't ready to present the president or congressional leaders, for that matter. I don't think it's difficult to see what's happening here. It was, however, determined fit to print in \"The New York Times.\" And the reason it is fit to leak to \"The New York Times\" is because it goes to this ongoing narrative that Democrats, frankly, cannot let go of, that somehow this president is preferential to Russia. We've gone through three-and-a-half years, tens of millions of dollars in investigations, conclusions definitively that that is not the case, both in terms of policy and in terms of past actions. And yet here we are again debating the same thing. I don't think there's any question in anybody's mind that if we have definitive proof that Russia had bounties on American soldiers that this president is going to act decisively to ensure that that doesn't happen, and they'll have a huge response if it does. BAIER: We mentioned the Iranian bounties on American soldiers in Afghanistan, and reaction of the Obama administration after that, Ben. DOMENECH: So I certainly think that the president would have a very robust response of this. The truth is that, as Josh indicated, we've had all of these allegations put out there, including by this current Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, who continues to engage in this ridiculous campaign where she suggests that Vladimir Putin has some of kind of thing over on the president. It's ludicrous, it's laughable. But it is a situation where I think when issues like this arise, we want to have clarity. And I think in this case, we don't really have clarity about what went on here, and we may not be able to have clarity because of the way that this story played out. BAIER: Meantime, the COVID situation, the news about the cases around the country and spikes in different states, Mara, the president speaking out that he's OK with masks. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, (R) PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I'm all for masks, I think masks are good. I would wear -- if I were in a group of people and I was close -- UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You would wear one? TRUMP: I would. I have. People have seen me wearing one. If I'm in a group of people where were not 10 feet away, but usually I'm not in that position. And everyone's tested. Because I'm the president, they get tested before they see me. But if I was in a tight situation with people, I would absolutely. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Do think the public will see that at some point? TRUMP: I'd have no problem. Actually, I had a mask on. I sort of liked the way I looked. (END VIDEO CLIP) (LAUGHTER) BAIER: Mara, listen, there are, on the serious side of this, Mara -- LIASSON: This is a new, this is -- BAIER: There's the economic guys that are looking at this saying, if you're pro-mask and you don't shut down, you could save the country a lot of GDP percentage that might go down if there's another shutdown. LIASSON: There's been some pretty studying estimates that masks help the economy, because you can go back to work with them. This is a new message from the president than the past. He suggested to the \"Wall Street Journal\" that people who wear masks are doing it to show their disapproval of him. He said to a reporter at the White House, you're wearing a mask because it's politically correct. So it sounds like the White House is changing its tune on masks. The question is, will the president start wearing one, not because he needs it to protect himself or others in the White House, but to model this behavior as something that other people should do. BAIER: And how much will he talk about COVID and be a part of the task force? There's all kinds of questions coming up with the politics. Panel, thank you so much with the secretary's interview. We'll stop there. Appreciate it. When we come back, the brighter side of things, some good news. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BAIER: Finally tonight, when life gives you lemons, you try to make lemonade, right? Well, that was the case for a five-year-old Cooper Wallweber when he heard that a volunteer firefighter was injured in a shooting at a local restaurant, he felt compelled to do something good for her. The Missouri boy got to work making and selling lemonade, raising more than $3,000 from his lemonade stand to help her out. Good job. Princess Paige Lemonade is well known in some neighborhoods around Minneapolis. Its founder, six-year-old Paige, sells lemonade in stores around the Twin Cities. The young entrepreneur donates the profits to the Ronald McDonald House for Families living near a sick child getting treatment, and sometimes Paige visits those kids who are dealing with the medical issues, and of course she shares her lemonade. So there you go, making lemonade out of lemons. Thanks for inviting us into your home tonight. That's it for the SPECIAL REPORT, fair, balanced, and still unafraid. \"THE STORY\" hosted by Martha MacCallum starts right now.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.MARTHA MACCALLUM, ANCHOR: Good evening everyone. I'm Martha MacCallum in New York and this is \"The Story.\" Tonight, an exclusive interview with the Vice President of the United States, Mike Pence. He was in COVID-19 briefings much of the day and will update us on that.But also tonight, anybody who was watching the questioning of Attorney General Barr today by the House Judiciary Committee could not help but be struck by the fact that, although the committee had pressed very hard to get the A.G. before them for a good grilling, what we saw was a good badgering and a lot of grandstanding with little apparent interest in allowing him to explain any of his answers. And that is so by really any objective assessment. Watch this for yourself.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)WILLIAM BARR, ATTORNEY GENERAL: Actually, I need to answer that question.REP. JOE NEGUSE, D-COLO: Mr. Attorney General, you did answer the question.BARR: No, you said under penalty of perjury. I'm going to answer the damn question.NEGUSE: Reclaiming my time.BARR: Yes, I'm answering your question.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Well you got to let him answer.NEGUSE: I'm reclaiming my time.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You think as the Chief - reclaiming my time.REP. JIM JORDAN, R-OHIO: If you want the Attorney General to come, at least let him answer the questions and the accusations made against him.BARR: Can we take a five-minute break, Mr. Chairman?REP. JERRY NADLER, D-N.Y.: No.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: No. Sorry, no five-minute break. Congressman Eric Swalwell was one of those questioners. We're going to talk to him about what happened in there today later in the program. But now we turn to the Vice President who has led the nation's response to the COVID-19 pandemic.Welcome Mr. Vice President. Good to have to you with us this evening.VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE: Good to be with you, Martha. Thank you.MACCALLUM: I just want to first - good to have you sir. I want to get your reaction to what happened in there today. You spent many years on the Hill representing Indiana. What did you think about that committee hearing today with Attorney General Barr?PENCE: Well, it was clear that the Democrats on the committee wanted to be heard more than they wanted to listen. Bill Barr is leading the Justice Department in this country with great integrity and he brings a lifetime of commitment to the rule of law.But to see it today in a little bit that I was able to watch, Martha, it was clear that the Democrats wanted to hear themselves talk more than they wanted to hear from the Attorney General of the United States.MACCALLUM: Yes. I mean I think that's just a fact. I think if we added up the time, I think it would prove to be a fact. Here is one of the thrust of today's hearing, which I wanted to ask you to address and it's the argument that the administration is basically fear mongering what's going on in Portland and beyond in order to leverage law and order election. Watch this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)NADLER: The President wants footage for his campaign ads. In most of those cities, the protests had begun to wind down, before you marched in and confronted the protestors.REP. ZOE LOFGREN, D-CALIF.: The playbook is to create the impression that there is violence that he must send in federal troops and that's how he hopes to win the election.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: What do you say to that, sir?PENCE: Well, Martha, look, from July 1 forward, the Department of Homeland Security informed me yesterday that we've had 188 federal officials injured by violent protesters in Portland, night after night tearing down the fencing, vandalizing the property, throwing projectiles, you've all seen it. And I think the fact that Jim Jordan stepped forward today and used his time to put those images before the committee and before the American people was a great service.The violence in Portland has got to stop. It is clear that the local leadership and the Mayor of Portland are not willing to step up. That's why we are talking to Governor Kate Brown and the State of Oregon about working in a way forward. Made no mistake about it--MACCALLUM: No.PENCE: --our federal officials are going to have the protection that they need. We're going to protect that federal courthouse. And President Trump has made it clear, we're going to have law and order in our streets.With Joe Biden, the radical Democrats, they want to defund the police. What we are going to do is we're going to fund law enforcement, we're going to stand up for law and order, and that begins right in Portland.MACCALLUM: So the other images that are shown are this wall of moms, wiping tear gas out of their eyes, and we have all seen the image of the navy member who was - they came at him pretty hard and broke his hand. Do you have any regrets about those incidents?PENCE: Well, I regret any time anybody is hurt. But let's be clear, before federal officials moved in a significant way in early July to the federal courthouse in Portland, the Mayor of Portland had said that he had seen a \"month of violence in Portland\". I mean there is nothing to the suggestion that having federal law enforcement officials, marshals, DHS personnel on the ground has had a causative effect here.The reality is that the Mayor of Portland in the local community has simply allowed violent protesters to overrun that community. That community was looking the other way on groups like Antifa a long time ago and now they are paying a price.But what President Trump has made clear, what we've made clear with federal officials as we are saying this far and no farther, we are not only going to protect the federal courthouse and do what it takes to bring our security there.But we're going to make sure that work with the State of Oregon and we reestablish peace on the streets of Portland. The people of that community deserve nothing less. And with this President of this administration, we're going to stand strong with law enforcement and for law and order.MACCALLUM: This head-to-head is clearly going to be a big issue in the election and you see how both sides are characterizing it at this point to their advantage. We'll see what the American people decide they believe in the end and all this.With regard to the election, even a question raised today, two big issues that were raised today, one is the issue of mail-in ballots and here is what Representative Greg Stanton of Arizona said about that today. Watch this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. GREG STANTON, D-ARIZ.: There are fears that you and the President are laying the foundation to interfere with the upcoming election specifically with vote by mail, as my colleagues have previously noted, because both of you have advanced false conspiracy theories about mail-in voting.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: There are so many states in the country that already have mail- in voting, they've had it for a long time. Is there any reason not to accelerate or offer that opportunity to people given the COVID-19 pandemic? Is there anything that's wrong with that in your mind?PENCE: Well Martha look, what we've had in this country for a long time is absentee ballot voting by mail. We've had in the State of Indiana, I've voted in absentee myself since I get this job in Washington D. C.MACCALLUM: Yes, you are right.PENCE: And look, that requires a person request the ballot and then the signature is verified and we protect the vote. The integrity of the vote is paramount. I mean through the generations, Americans have worn the uniform, fought and died to protect all of our freedoms and the right to vote is at the heart of this democracy, and absentee balloting is a time honored tradition.But what you see across this country in Democrat led states is an effort for universal distribution of ballots. Without the accountability that you have with absentee balloting, and when you combine that with states like California that actually allow what is called vote bundling or vote harvesting, you see where the entire ability for widespread fraud is very real.And what you're hearing from President Trump and you will continue to hear from this administration is a commitment to protect the one person, one vote, integrity of our electoral system, and we are going to stand strong on that.MACCALLUM: Let me ask you - I mean I get asked this a lot, do you think it's going - because we will be obviously doing our coverage as usual - do you think it going to be a one night election or you think it's going to go on for weeks, could it go - even go on for a month? Given the situation that we are in with this pandemic, what do you think?PENCE: Well look, I think President Donald Trump is going to be elected for four more years, and I see greater enthusiasm all across this country today.MACCALLUM: But do you think that will happen on November 3?PENCE: As I travel across the country, then I saw four years ago and I think it's going to translate to November 3. But make no mistake about it, the reality of voter fraud is undeniable. We have seen case after case around the country where there have been prosecutions. The president spoke about New Jersey. We've seen it in other states.In my own state of Indiana in 2012, there was a Democrat super PAC that was involved in our elections that literally - there was a group of people that were prosecuted for falsifying ballots. This happens, Martha.And I got to tell you, when you think about the price we have paid for this democracy through the generations, my father wore the uniform in combat, my son is in the Marine Corps, my son-in-law is in the navy, we have to stand for the principle of one person, one vote. And voter integrity is at the heart of what our democracy is all about.MACCALLUM: It sounds like that the possibility is open that it could go on longer if indeed that integrity - you believe that integrity is breached or the President does. So we will stay tuned to see where that goes.I was listening to the former Vice President Joe Biden today and he was speaking about his \"Build Back Better\" plan. One of the things that he mentioned was that he was trying to seek more equity in terms of racial justice and he said that he would be open to the idea of more farmland for black and brown farm owners. Do you think that it is proper to allocate benefits or resources in this country based on the color of people's skin?PENCE: I think under this President, you've seen an agenda that's about advancing the opportunity for every American regardless of racial or creed or color. And Martha, I couldn't be more proud that in our first three years, because this is a President who cut taxes, rolled back regulation, fought for free and fair trade, and supported educational opportunities for every American.We saw the lowest unemployment rate ever recorded for African-Americans, we saw historic investments in black colleges and universities around America. And with Senator Tim Scott, we saw the creation of more than 8,000 opportunity zones in cities that are tracking investments. If Joe Biden and the Democrats want to do something for minority communities, how about - let minority families choose where their children go to school? I mean how about.MACCALLUM: Well, I wanted to ask you about that. But I am going to take that as a no that you are not in favor of the allocation of land based on skin color. You didn't directly answer the questions, but is that accurate, are you not in favor of any program like that?PENCE: Well, honestly I didn't hear what Joe Biden said today and I don't even understand the concept. What we do in this country is we create opportunities for everyone. Joe Biden is denying the ability for African- American families and minority families to choose where their children go to school. He actually wants to defund the school choice program right here in Washington D.C.MACCALLUM: No, we asked his representative about that last night and I think that's going to be a big issue.PENCE: When you talk about building back the economy better, remember this is a President who passed historic tax cuts, rolled back regulation. Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders, their unity agenda of the radical left, they actually want to raise taxes by $4 trillion. They have a $2 trillion Green New Deal program that looks like cylinder (ph) on steroids.I mean look, we're not going to build America back better with more government, higher taxes, more regulation, more liberal policies. We're going to build America back better, stronger and more prosperous by doing again what President Trump and I did in our first three years, and that is less government, less taxes, free and fair trade, educational opportunities for all. That's the way that we can grow this economy and full recovery and then some from this pandemic.MACCALLUM: I only have a few more minutes and I would be remiss if I don't ask you some questions about your COVID-19 meetings today. But I do want to be, since you went there, I would like to ask you about school choice because I was very interested in this particular soundbite from the President on this issue of going back to school. Let's play that.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: If schools do not reopen, the funding should go to parents to send their child to public private charter religious or home school of their choice.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: Now that - I think that caught a lot of people's attention, Vice President. And today, you have the American Federation of Teachers saying that they will back teachers who want to go on strike in this country, as you are under efforts to try to reopen the schools and get kids back in the classroom this fall.So what does that look like? If I'm a parent in America and my school says they are closed, and President Trump says that I can somehow use that money for school choice, that's not on the books right now. What if I really want to make that happen? How can I do that?PENCE: Well, it's one of the reasons why we are demanding that a significant portion of any additional relief funding for education in our states actually go to support school choice programs around the country.But look, Martha, I'm married to a school teacher. She is getting ready to be back in the classroom this fall. We've got to get our kids back to school. Now there's going to be some states and we follow the data on the White House Coronavirus Task Force county by county, city by city. There are going to be some areas that will want to move in a more measured way. We will expect Governors and states as they make those decisions.But look, CDC put out guidance last week that recommended that we get our kids for their academic wellbeing and their health and wellbeing back into the classroom. We know the risk of the coronavirus to healthy children is very low. We know that there are real costs disrupting education for special needs kids, disrupting nutrition. I mean the reality is our kids are going to be better off in school and by working with the states, implementing CDC guidance, we can have.MACCALLUM: But can they - sir, pardon me for interrupting, but can they as the President said, can parents send their children to a public, private, charter, religious or home school or other choice under the current law? Do they have that option?PENCE: Martha, the President said they ought to be able to do that. There's been no greater champion of school choice in the history of this country than President Donald Trump. We're going to continue to stand for and advocate that principle.But right now it's absolutely essential and we are working with every Governor to get our kids back in school. It's best for our kids academically and personally, it's best for working families. And as we open up America, we got to open up America school. And make no mistake about it Martha, as CDC said again last week, as American pediatricians said a couple of weeks ago, we can safely reopen our schools.MACCALLUM: Yes, there's a lot of pushback.PENCE: And at the President's direction, we're going to work our hearts out to get our kids back in the classroom.MACCALLUM: Lot of union organizations, a lot of teachers, a lot of pushback on that. And I know that there's a lot of charter schools and religious schools that would love to have the opportunity to offer those spots to those kids. So that's something we are going to watch personally.Okay, vaccines, some of the sort of reality check on vaccines is that, once they are out there, it's not going to be an instant, everything is better now, everybody gets a vaccine. There is some doctors saying they may work for some people, they might not be a complete umbrella for others. What you can tell us right now about how different it will be at the end of this year or the beginning of next year?PENCE: Well look, just yesterday I was in Florida, the President was in North Carolina. We literally saw in record time the start of Phase Three clinical trials for the first coronavirus vaccine.MACCALLUM: Yes, that's remarkable.PENCE: Now Martha, you understand this. But people need to understand, a vaccine usually takes years to develop, but what President Trump did early on was say, we need to clear away any red tape barriers.He called on our pharmaceutical industry to step up and to accelerate the process without cutting any corners on safety, and now we've got a half a dozen different vaccine platforms that are in development. And I got to tell you, when you got Dr. Fauci saying that it's not if, it's when we have a vaccine, it gives you the signal that we really have great confidence that by this fall, we're going to have a vaccine.And the really exciting thing is under operation warp speed, we are literally producing those vaccines right now. We are purchasing millions of syringes right now, so that the moment that the FDA says that a vaccine is safe and effective, we will have the supplies on hand and literally offer vaccines to tens of millions of Americans and we'll start that process the day that it gets approved.MACCALLUM: Begin mass production. Yes, that is not the way it usually happens. All right, before I let you go, testing, I had a close friend who needed to get a test this week, was told 7-10 days until they would get the results back.I mean by that time anybody that you - if you got it, anybody you came in contact with, I don't know how you are going to contact trace that person - if the wait is too long, everybody says this everywhere you go, when are we going to see a situation where you can either do a home test or you can get a test result back in 24-48 hours at the latest?PENCE: Well, first off, I think the American people should take great pride in the fact that four months ago, we were at a standing start. We had done about 8,000 coronavirus tests. As of today, we have done 55 million coronavirus tests because of the public private partnership that President Trump initiated early on.We are actually doing 800,000 coronavirus tests a day on average. That being said particularly in some hotspot areas, we're dealing with some delays. The average amount of time we are told from the commercial labs which do half of the testing is about four and a half days. It's one of the reasons why the FDA this last weekend approved what's called pooling, Martha. This will allow these commercial labs not just to test one swab at a time, but to test five and ten samples at a time.MACCALLUM: And that hopefully will speed it up?PENCE: And it will speed it up. But also remember, the other half of testing is done very quickly because the half of testing in this country is already being done with point-of-care tests that turn it around in 15 minutes or at hospitals and in-hospital labs. When people are in hospitals, we want to get that test done immediately. We are working with research hospitals around the country to make sure we do it.MACCALLUM: I mean that's great if you can get it, I went all through, I Googled every single place in the entire state of New Jersey and you can't get a rapid test.PENCE: We are making great progress and - one last thing on that Martha, if I may.MACCALLUM: Yes.PENCE: We are also distributing 15,400 Abbott point-of-care 15 minute test to every single nursing home in America.MACCALLUM: Well, that's important. That's very important. We talked about that a lot here.PENCE: 600 last week and 600 this week, and in the next four weeks or so, every nursing home in America will have a 15 minute test to be able to test residents and faculty. And we hope very soon when it's approved visitors visiting loved ones.MACCALLUM: All right. I got to jump out there or I'm going to get cut off. Vice President Mike Pence, thank you very much sir, great to have you with us.PENCE: Good to be with you, Martha.MACCALLUM: So coming up next, we will talk to Congressman Eric Swalwell. He was one of the Democrats who was there questioning Bill Barr today. Then Guy Benson will follow-up after that when we get back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)MACCALLUM: It was a raucous hearing in there today as members of the Judiciary Committee grilled the Attorney General on everything from the riots in Portland to healthcare and everything in between. Here's some of the exchange today between Congressman Swalwell and Attorney General William Barr.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. ERIC SWALWELL, D-CALIF: So, how can you sit here and tell us why should I investigate the President of the United States, if you are not even aware of the facts concerning the President using the pardon or commutation power to swap the silence of a witness?BARR: Because we require a reliable predicate before we open a criminal investigation.SWALWELL: And I just gave to you sir.BARR: I don't consider it. I consider it a very Rube Goldberg theory that you have.SWALWELL: Well, it sounds like you're hearing this first time today.BARR: And by the way, if I apply history, there will be a lot more people under investigation.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: Congressman Eric Swalwell, welcome, good to have you here tonight.SWALWELL: Thanks Martha.MACCALLUM: So, we played a lot of clips from what we watched, I watched a lot of it straight through today and I was just struck by the question of how that's a fair process when someone is brought into that room and then for the most part - I mean actually you allowed him to answer questions I think more than most of your colleagues, who wouldn't even let him breathe and answer, how is that a fair process?SWALWELL: Well, the Attorney General doesn't need an ice-cream cone before he sits down to answer questions, Martha.MACCALLUM: No, but he needs to be allowed to answer the question.SWALWELL: He's a big boy, he answered the questions. I wanted to point out that you can only have a corrupt President if you have an Attorney General who would enable it, and he acknowledged that only once in his memory did he intervene to help somebody get a reduced sentence and that was the President's friend. And I thought that exchange was productive, he got to say what he wanted to say, and I got to make the point I wanted to make.MACCALLUM: Well, and his point was that he didn't believe that there was anything wrong with the process that he carried out. You made your point as you say and he made his. But I mean, the idea that to suggest that he is a big boy and doesn't need an ice cream cone, people wouldn't let him answer a single question. They kept saying, give me back my time, give me back my time.So here is my question, your committee has wanted him to come in here for a long time, right. I think myself and a lot of other Americans wanted to see the exchange, because you have - oh many of you have accused him of sort of being a side lamp to the President acting on his behalf.This was a golden opportunity for the country to hear what his answer was and they didn't get to hear what his answer was, and I'm wondering if there was a fear that if he was given that opportunity, then he might be persuasive to some people.SWALWELL: Well, I was concerned by what we did here. He said that he's talking to the President about his reelection campaign. I don't want an independent prosecutor doing that.MACCALLUM: He said, of course it comes up, I'm in the cabinet, I'm not going to sit here and lie to you and tell you that it's never come up in a cabinet meeting. He was being extra careful.SWALWELL: He also implied that there may be some foreign interference, that's okay, which again we don't want the top national security lawyer to say that.MACCALLUM: Let me just play an example of this, Eric.SWALWELL: And Martha, he co-signed on the President's theory that has been debunked by everyone that mail-in balloting is fraudulent. But go ahead, play your clip.MACCALLUM: All right. Let's watch some of what happened, go ahead.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. PRAMILA JAYAPAL, D-WA.: When protesters with guns and swap.BARR: I am aware of protesters in the federal government.JAYAPAL: Excuse me, Mr. Barr, this is my time and I control it.BARR: I have already explained that it had been planned all day.JAYAPAL: Attorney General, the time is mine. We've waited a long time for you to come here, the time is mine.BARR: You waited to talk to me like this? You didn't need to wait for so long.It is not a self defining terms as they - that they recognize.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You've only got two minutes sir. Mr. Barr, if I may?BARR: Yes, but this is a hearing. I thought I was the one that was supposed to be heard.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: Good question. I mean you could have just propped up a picture of him and yelled at it.SWALWELL: I don't think he's as weak as you were describing him.MACCALLUM: I am not suggesting he's weak at all, I'm suggesting that you were sitting - you brought him in there to answer questions and then you didn't give him a chance to answer them. I know it doesn't matter what side of the fence you are on, anybody can watch that process and say it was not a hearing - that was not a hearing.SWALWELL: I thought it was also an important point that it seems like they are selectively using the police, and I think Joe Biden said it best today. We should prosecute anarchists and people who are burning buildings.However, when you are only sending the troops in to protect the courthouses while armed protesters are going to Michigan, they are going to Wisconsin, and they are in militia gear, they are carrying their assault weapons and they are threatening to kill the governors there, why aren't you sending in the troops there? Instead, he is suing the governors for having stayaway orders that for people to be safe during COVID. So I think that was a productive exchange as well.MACCALLUM: Okay. Here he is answering that question about burning down a federal courthouse. Watch this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BARR: Federal courts are under attack. Since when is it okay to try to burn down a federal court? The U.S. Marshals have a duty to stop that and defend the courthouse, and that's what we are doing in Portland. We are at the courthouse defending the courthouse. We are not out looking for trouble.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: Do you believe that when people are bending down the fence in front of the courthouse and breaking it and trying to get through to attack the courthouse itself that that's a problem and that Federal Marshals need to protect it?SWALWELL: Yes. I believe you can arrest people who are trying to burn down the courthouse and not dust a mom, use violence against an unarmed veteran or shoot projectiles against an unarmed individual who are still in the hospital today. I think you can do both and I think they are just making the situation worse.MACCALLUM: Well, there are some investigations with regard to the specific situation that you talked about. I just asked the vice president about that as well. Because I think that everybody, you know, wants situations to be fair on the ground and we don't want peaceful protesters to be hurt in any way.Eric Swalwell, thank you. Good to see you today.SWALWELL: My pleasure. Thanks.MACCALLUM: Guy Benson is here, hot of the Guy Benson show, a Fox News contributor and author of \"End of Discussion.\" Talk about \"End of Discussion,\" Guy, I mean, there was no discussion in there. I think that no matter what side of the fence you are on, anybody who watch that had to be a little frustrated.GUY BENSON, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, Martha, you said that you watch it for hours on end.MACCALLUM: I did.BENSON: I made it about 90 minutes. I think we are both masochists watching that spectacle just down the street from me here in Washington.I mean, you're right, they should have perhaps maybe bought a cardboard cutout of Bill Barr, they could have sat him in that chair and they have screamed at him for increments of five minutes and maybe, I don't know, thrown some rotten fruit or something and pounded the dust because but most of the Democrats on that dais clearly had absolutely no interest whatsoever in gleaning any information from the attorney general.They wanted to vent at him and they did, and it was frankly embarrassing and sort of painful to watch.MACCALLUM: Well, Bill Barr is a very smart man. And whether you like him or you don't like him, or whether you think he is, you know, too cozy with the president, whatever you think.He, if they had given him a chance, the likelihood that he was going to give them answers that might cause some people to pause, and think maybe, you know, and kind of understand his line of thinking was pretty good.BENSON: Yes.MACCALLUM: So, you know, do you think that that was part of the issue that they didn't want to give him that oxygen, or, you know, why --BENSON: Bingo.MACCALLUM: -- why would they -- what else would be the motivation for the way this --(CROSSTALK)BENSON: No, I think -- I think you nailed it. So, if people want to see something worthwhile from the hearing I encourage them to go watch the opening statement from the attorney general which was interrupted, the only uninterrupted really portion of the entire event for the attorney general.Smart, thoughtful, measured nuance. And I think that you're right, Martha. I think for a lot of these Democrats, they had a bunch of talking points and attacks they wanted to get out, they had limited time and Barr, let's be frank, I think is a much smarter man than many of the people up there and maybe on both sides of the aisle. He's a very bright individual. He also has command of the facts.So, they wanted to throw out and hurl allegations his way where he has answers. They, I think deep down know he has some good responses that might, God forbid, be persuasive and compelling to viewers at home so they wouldn't let him a word in edgewise. And the result, again, I think was humiliating for them and not edifying to the home viewers certainly unless you're a hard-core resistance person, in which case you probably love that theater.MACCALLUM: Might have loved it. And if that's the case then you also love it when he asked can we please have a five-minute break and was told by Chairman Nadler no.BENSON: No. He said no to a bathroom break.MACCALLUM: No. No. You cannot have a five-minute break. And they said, all right, you can have a five-minute break. He's like the mean teacher.Thank you very much, Guy. Good to see as always.BENSON: Martha, am I allowed to go? Can I take a break because I'm --(CROSSTALK)LEMON: Yes, you may take a break BENSON: All right.MACCALLUM: You may take a break. Everyone can take a break. We're going to have a commercial in a moment.The mayor of Portland, Oregon, demanding that the president pull his federal troops out of the city, as he puts it. But local business owners may feel a little bit differently. We're going to talk to one of them coming up next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)MACCALLUM: The scenes out of Portland are difficult to watch especially for the people whose livelihoods are on the line in that area. The business owners they've watch so much of what they have worked for in some cases smashed to pieces, their windows are broken, their buildings burned to the ground in some cases. The mayor of Portland blames the president for escalating the violence.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MAYOR TED WHEELER, D-PORTLAND: If we are not able to get the federal administration to back off and leave our city it will happen all across the United States jeopardizing the United States Constitution.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: All right. Ted Wheeler says it's all Washington's fault what is happening in Portland right now.Joining me now, James Louie, owner of Huber's Cafe in downtown Portland, a restaurant that has been in business since 1879. Mr. Louie, thank you very much for being here. What is your take on what's going on in Portland and what's happening to the businesses like yours?JAMES LOUIE, OWNER, HUBER'S CAFE: Well, between the COVID-19 pandemic and the black lives demonstrations, it's really damaging to business in general. Our business and businesses in downtown Portland, people don't want to come downtown.I mean, the Oregon health authority, they say stay home and save lives. And then of course people don't want to come downtown because of the protests, even though the violent protests are happening at the justice center and that's five blocks away from us.But people are concerned about getting caught up in the protest march or people are concerned about having their vehicle vandalized and so people don't want to come downtown. It's a, like you say, it's a lot of restaurants. A lot of businesses have closed because of those reasons.MACCALLUM: It's really sad what we've seen in Portland and so many places across the country. What -- do you agree with the Mayor, Ted Wheeler, who says, you know, that this is really the fault of these federal agents that came to the area to protect that federal court building?LOUIE: Well, it does seem like it has created a reaction. When you think about the population of Portland, Oregon, 600,000, and you have maybe 1,000, maybe 2,000 people demonstrating down at the courthouse. It's the most, a small segment of the population. And mainstream Americans who live here in Portland, Oregon, we'd like to see the vandalism, the violence to stop and we'd like things to go back to normal.MACCALLUM: I don't blame you. I don't blame you, Mr. Louie and your business one that I know you take great pride in, it's been in the city for a very long time. And whatever it takes we all want to see the situation righted and we want to see people be able to go out, back out to dinner and back out to work and we wish you all the best.James Louie, thank you very much for sharing your perspective with us tonight. We appreciate it, sir.LOUIE; Well, it was my pleasure. Thank you for having me on.MACCALLUM: Thank you very much.Coming up next, we're going to talk to General Jack Keane on the Trump administration's dramatic shift towards China, when we come back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)MACCALLUM: Tonight, where are the United States and China headed? you've got tensions escalating between the White House and leadership in Beijing drawing comparisons to the world dynamic before World War II.In a new op-ed Ian Haworth at the Daily Wire suggests China is our generation's Nazi, Germany. And Asia analyst, Gordon Chang is now comparing China under Xi Jinping to Japan under Emperor Hirohito in the 1930s.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GORDON CHANG, AUTHOR, THE COMING COLLAPSE OF CHINA: Two thousand eighteen, for instance, they lasered a U.S. C-130 in Djibouti. When you try to blind the pilots of an American plane, you're trying to bring it down and kill the crew.There have been the sonic attacks against U.S. diplomats of the Guangzhou consulate at about the same time causing brain injuries. We've seen all sorts of incidents around China's periphery. You know, it's very new in a sense, but it's also very old. This is 1930s Japan.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: Fascinating. Here now, General Jack Keane, chairman of the Institute for the Study of War and a Fox News senior strategic analyst. General, always good to see you. Thank you for being here tonight.I know that you say that we are seeing a true strategic shift in our relationship in China and the perspective of this administration. And do you see the threat that China poses as similar to those powers before World War II?JACK KEANE, FOX NEWS SENIOR STRATEGIC ANALYST: Yes. Similar in terms of what they are trying to achieve. I mean, President Xi has told us in a way that no previous Chinese administration have said, that he wants to achieve the so-called China dream, which is domination and control of the Asia- pacific region and replace United States as a global power in the world. He believes the United States is a declining power and they are rising power.And what he doesn't say but he clearly is trying to achieve and that is replacing international order that has sustained a general sense of world stability since post-World War II in a sense that we haven't had another epic war among major powers.He wants that to go away and achieve that kind of influence that he has. And I believe, the other thing, Martha, I think he's buoyed by a number of things, a very strong economy that his predecessor did not have. And he has a growing dominating military by comparison to the United States and it gives him enormous confidence.And I believe he's put his ambitions on a fast track. I think he's got the hard liners in his country behind him, the moderates and others I think have serious reservations about what he is doing.And yes, we are in a major strategic shift. What really the catalyst for it was growing a local regionalized epidemic in his own country in a particular province that he -- where he protected the rest of his country particularly his power centers in Beijing and Shanghai but let it spread through international flights to the world writ large.MACCALLUM: Yes.KEANE: That and crushing the autonomy of Hong Kong has had -- the world has looked at this and that is causing the strategic shift much sooner than we thought. And the United States, I give this administration some credit for stepping up and exercising a leadership role and trying to bring together a broad coalition and fashion a strategy to deal with the reality of the Chinese Communist Party and its very serious ambitions.MACCALLUM: Here's Steve Bannon on that coalition idea. Watch this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)STEVE BANNON, FORMER WHITE HOUSE ADVISOR: Developed into an alliance of liberty bringing in the United Kingdom, India, and Japan. Used Hong Kong as the Annville and the U.S. dollar as the hammer, it's time now to take the fight directly financially to the Chinese Communist Party.General Secretary Xi is defiling in the gun sites. I think he should be sanctioned personally. His henchmen around hm should be sanctioned personally. We should start to seize all their assets in the United States and London.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: In its discussion about this alignment of the United Kingdom, Australia which Secretary Pompeo talked about, Japan, India. And then on the other side, of course, you have China, Iran, Russia with aligned interest there as well which I think, you know, does remind a lot of people at the kind of alignments that we saw in World War II.KEANE: Yes, certainly. I mean, these are very strong democracies that are being threatened because if Xi is able to achieve what he's talking about, that challenges the sovereignty of all of our democratic states and that is what is unifying us as it did during World War II and as it did post-World War II dealing with the existential threat of the Soviet Union.Now we don't have hundreds of thousands of troops facing each other in Europe like we did post-World War II. We don't have thousands of missiles facing each other as we did then with large air forces also in place ready to go.But make no mistake here. The ambitions that President Xi has are every bit as serious as what the Soviet Union had and the Nazis and imperialistic Japan.MACCALLUM: Yes.KEANE: And why we deal with this, we don't have to lose control, we don't have to lose our sense of rationality here, we don't have to over react, but we do have to act. And we have to act sensibly with good sound judgment and do it in concert with our allies.The world has been here before dealing with thugs like this and we can deal with them. And putting together a plan to do it in terms of a strategy and also a coalition I think is the right answer and it should transcend administrations because this is going to take some time.MACCALLUM: Well, that's going to be a big question in terms of this election and how a continuing President Trump or a new president in the form of Vice President Biden would face this threat, which I think the history books will trace back to the COVID pandemic and how it altered the dynamic in many ways in the world because they put the trade deal on the back burner and change things overall in terms of the strategy.General Jack Keane, thank you, sir. Always good to see you.KEANE: Good talking to you, Martha.MACCALLUM: Have a good night. You too.All right, everybody. It is July and a great white shark attack has now just happened for the first time ever in Maine as a fatal attack. It killed a swimmer off the coast, as we start to see more sharks in these areas up the New England coast.A senior shark scientist, one of the world-renowned people on this issue is with me after the break. Stay tuned.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)MACCALLUM: Be vigilant, that is the warning from authorities in Maine tonight who say that a 63-year-old woman was attacked and killed by a great white shark while swimming just off the shore, 30 to 40 feet from the beach off of Bailey Island in Casco Bay.The cause of death was confirmed by a tooth fragment that was left behind by the shark and while this is Maine's first ever deadly shark attack, officials say that they have seen an increase in shark sightings off the New England coast over recent years.New York City resident Julie Holowach was attacked on Monday afternoon, just yesterday, while she was swimming about 20 yards off of the shore.Joining me now, Dr. Gregory Skomal, shark scientist who had shark research and serves as senior fisheries biologist for the Massachusetts division of marine fisheries.Dr. Skomal, thank you for being here. We've spoken before about this and as we said, this is the first time that we have seen something like this in Maine. And I'm going to show the maps in just a moment. But what's your reaction to this horrible attack?GREGORY SKOMAL, SHARK SCIENTIST: well, anytime a person that has bitten by a shark and in this case, it's fatal, you know, it's a tragedy. It's horrendous and it's devastating. You know, I don't -- I've been studying sharks for many, many years and I don't like to see these kinds of events happened whatsoever.MACCALLUM: So, I'm going to put up the Sharktivity app that shows a lot of concentration near where I spend a lot of time in Chatham, Massachusetts. It's hard to see at home I know, but the collection of blue dots that you see at the bottom of your screen, that's Cape Cod and we see lots of great white sharks in that area, we've seen them for many years there.But, Greg, at the very top of this map of New England all the way up there is that shark up in Casco. So why do you -- why do you think we're seeing this migration of them up the coast now.SKOMAL: I think it's important for people to realize, Martha, that the Gulf of Maine, the coast of Maine all the way to Canada, these are areas that white sharks have been going to for hundreds if not thousands of years, so this is not a new phenomenon.What is happening though is we're seeing the restoration of shark populations, namely the great white shark, in addition to the restoration of seal populations. And what basic equation is simple. White sharks consume seals. So, the more seals that are occurring along the coastline including the coast of Maine, the more likely we'll see white sharks in those areas attempting to feed on those seals.MACCALLUM: So, we saw one fatal attack I believe it was two years ago now, Labor Day on the Cape. And now, this woman, sadly, in Maine. Is there -- is it that people are swimming too close to these seals, I mean, why are we starting to see this? And they are so close to shore.SKOMAL: Well, I think it's really important though to put it in the context of risk. I mean, if you look at the statistics the probability of being bitten by a shark still remains remarkably low. But nonetheless, any kind of incident of this nature is absolutely horrible.What's happening is as these sharks come back to these areas where they traditionally have fed on seals, we have overlap with human activities and a lot of human activities, particularly days like today. I mean, these are really, you know, hot days and people are getting on and in the water, and they're going into this area where white sharks. This predator-prey relationship is happening.MACCALLUM: Yes. Dr. Greg Skomal, one of the foremost experts on great white sharks, we appreciate you being here and our thoughts go out to Julie's family.

Others considering it. We're similarly following developments in North Carolina, where we're told that schools will reopen in the fall, but with some caveats, also following developments in a host of other states that are playing kind of loosey- goosey with this, a mix of in-person classes, virtual classes. Bottom line, the president has said that he wants to see all schools reopen in the fall. It is now a given, at the very least, that some of the more populated school districts across the country will not heed his wishes. Welcome, everybody. I'm Neil Cavuto. And this is YOUR WORLD. Let's go to Jonathan Serrie with the latest on this, as well as the latest case count that has really spurred all this -- Jonathan. JONATHAN SERRIE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: It has, indeed, Neil. North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper's announcement came just within the past hour. He says that all students, regardless of whether they're kindergarten or as old as 12th grade, they're going to have to wear masks and social distance if they return to physical school buildings in the hall -- in the fall. As far as his plans for reopening, he really envisions a hybrid plan. Here's what he said: (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. ROY COOPER (D-NC): Today, we announced that North Carolina schools will be open for both in-person and remote learning, with key safety precautions to protect the health of our students, teachers, staff, and families. (END VIDEO CLIP) SERRIE: Later in the show, we will be hearing from the superintendent of the nation's second largest school district. The Los Angeles Unified School District has decided to stick with online instruction, as that city's positive test rate for coronavirus approaches 10 percent. That's twice the World Health Organization's maximum safe threshold for communities to reopen. But in neighboring Orange County, the school board voted to recommend schools reopen in the fall without mandates for face coverings or social distancing. And, in Detroit, protesters blocked school buses, as that city begins summer classes this week. New York City plans to offer a hybrid of both in- person and online learning in the fall. Four former CDC directors are criticizing the Trump administration for undermining federal health officials' recommendations on reopening schools and the economy. In a Washington Post op-ed today, they write: \"These repeated efforts to subvert sound public health guidelines introduce chaos and uncertainty, while unnecessarily putting lives at risk.\" Neil, you may recall, last week, President Trump tweeted that the CDC's guidance for school openings was -- quote -- \"very tough and expensive\" -- back to you. CAVUTO: Thank you, my friend, very much, Jonathan Serrie. We're going to be getting the read from the White House momentarily how the president is responding to this. In the meantime, I want to go to Austin Beutner, the L.A. Unified District superintendent. Superintendent, thank you for taking the time. What are you going to do? How does the fall look to you right now? AUSTIN BEUTNER, SUPERINTENDENT, LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT: \u00a0Thanks for having me. We're going to start online, because that's where health and safety take us. As your colleague mentioned, the rate of infection in our community is twice the World Health Organization guidelines for opening a community. So we have got to start there. And we know it's a struggle. We know we're balancing three sometimes conflicting objectives, the learning needs of students, the impact the virus is having on working families and the communities we serve, and the health and safety of all in the school community. We have to put health and safety first. CAVUTO: So, when the president says that districts that are not doing this, or states or locales that are not opening up are doing it politically and it's all politically motivated, what do you want to tell him? BEUTNER: We have got to get out of the politics and get into the realm of solving the solution, solving the problem, which is, we all want to be back in schools as soon as possible. We know where that's the best learning occurs. Whether that's the White House or here in Los Angeles, I think we could all agree on that. Let's focus on where the federal government can help get us back to school quicker. And if we look at examples around the world, they have done three things well. They have changed health practice in schools. They will spread the desks apart, wear the masks, put down the painter's tape, so people don't bump into each other in the hall, clean surfaces. That's been talked about a lot. The other two pieces, the other two legs of the stool are testing and contact tracing. And we think, until that's done in schools, it's going to keep us from getting back. But, if we do it, we can get back safer and quicker. CAVUTO: Superintendent, if the governor had not reimposed some restrictions on businesses and bars, indoor dining, on that sort of thing, would you have moved to delay the in-person school year? BEUTNER: Yes, we arrived at our decision, actually, before he made that announcement. We have been tracking the health factors for the last month or so. Back in May, it looked better. There was less incidence in the community. We were below the World Health Organization threshold. Since June, it's really skyrocketed, now being twice that threshold. So we have known for a period of weeks we're headed towards this point. Now that we see clear data, we made the decision. But we actually made that before the governor imposed the further restrictions on businesses. CAVUTO: Superintendent, we're learning today that New Hampshire, New Jersey and North Carolina all plan to open for in-person classes. I believe the North Carolina governor did leave open the possibility that districts, municipalities that feel otherwise, are uncomfortable with that, or dealing -- I'm paraphrasing here, sir -- a spike in cases and the like, that they can go the virtual route. But they are trying the in-person route first. You are not. Is it -- is it just a sense that the kids, it's a danger for them, it's a danger their exposure to teachers and administrators, the risk of them bringing it back home? What cinched it for you? BEUTNER: Well, just a couple things to mention. First is, this is a local disease that happens locally. So, the conditions in New Hampshire and North Carolina may be different than here in Los Angeles. If we were having this conversation in May or early June, I'd say, all systems go, we're going to be back in school facilities. It's now July, mid-July, and that has changed. The facts and circumstances have changed here in Los Angeles. The other thing that we're learning is more and more science and data becomes available to us. There was a study done on a village, a town in Italy; 15,000 people were all tested because they quarantined the whole village. Of those who tested positive, half of them showed no symptoms. That's a wakeup call for all of us that we have got to get that testing in place, because, even if we were to reopen facilities in a congregant setting and bring back multiple generations, a 10-year-old student with a 30-year-old teacher and a 50-year-old bus driver, going home to a 7-year-old grandmother, before we do that, we got to make sure that we're keeping all who may have the virus out of the school community. That includes those who show no symptoms, and testing is the only way to do that. CAVUTO: Mr. Beutner, thank you very much for taking the time, Austin Beutner, the L.A. Unified School superintendent. I want to go to the White House now in reaction to all of this. The president, as you know, has not been a fan of any school system that toys with the possibility of delaying the start of the in-person school year. Now you have three very big ones in Atlanta and, of course, Los Angeles right now that are saying -- San Diego as well -- we're not so sure about that. We're going to push things back. Kristin Fisher at the White House now with all the goings on there -- Kristin. KRISTIN FISHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Yes, well, despite those developments in California, the state's two largest school districts saying they are going to go online only in August, the White House is really continuing to push that all schools reopen for in-person classes this fall. And, right now, the vice president, Mike Pence, is in Louisiana making that case. He did wear a mask today, as his did almost everybody else that he was with, except for when he was speaking, which is important, because cases of coronavirus are on the rise there. And the point that the vice president was making is that, remember, New Orleans saw that really early surge in cases. It was one of the original hot spots. They were able to flatten or at least bend the curve. And the vice president said today that he believes that they will be able to bend it back down for a second time. As for schools, the vice president said that the governor of Louisiana informed us today that the plan in that state is to reopen schools on time. The vice president was joined by several members of the Coronavirus Task Force, the education secretary, Betsy DeVos. Dr. Birx was also there. But one key member of the Coronavirus Task Force was not there, Dr. Anthony Fauci. He is going to be speaking to students at Georgetown University in just a few minutes. And, yesterday, he was making the case that he believes an entire shutdown is not necessary, but he believes that, in order to reopen safely, there does need to be a little bit of a pullback. Listen here. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, NIAID DIRECTOR: I am really confident we can, if we step back. You don't necessarily need to shut down again, but pull back a bit, and then proceed in a very prudent way of observing the guidelines of going from step to step. (END VIDEO CLIP) FISHER: Meanwhile, you have the former Vice President and the president's 2020 opponent Joe Biden giving a big speech today on the economy. But he also really pushed back on the president's plan for not just reopening the country, but reopening schools this fall. Watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOSEPH BIDEN (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Mr. President, open everything now isn't a strategy for success. It's barely a slogan. Quit pushing the false choice between protecting our health and protecting our economy. All it does is endanger our recovery on both fronts. (END VIDEO CLIP) FISHER: So, Neil, it's going to be very interesting to see if President Trump decides to respond to some of those attacks from the former Vice President Joe Biden when President Trump speaks in the Rose Garden. That is set for 5:00 p.m., Neil. CAVUTO: All right, Kristin, thank you very much, Kristin Fisher at the White House. We will be monitoring those developments as well. Just a quick peek give, before we take a break, corner of Wall and Broad. It wasn't this confusion over school reopenings that had folks buying today. It was the promise of vaccines and treatments, no fewer than at least 15 of them either paired with other companies or governments, one showing such promise that it could be available by the fall. We're on that, also on top of the other big story gripping the nation, the continued violence in America's cities, two big ones on the West Coast that have a lot of folks wondering, will it ever end? After this. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) CAVUTO: If you're a foreign student and here in the United States, and you're studying at colleges online, and you're worried about the president's directive issued a little more than a week ago that he might be inclined to kick you out, you can relax. He relented a little bit. The president outlining his plan right now that he will not be doing that for international college students to leave the U.S. if they're still in the middle of their classes, whether they're online or not. He might detail that a little bit more when he addresses reporters in about 45 minutes. Separately, we were telling you right now about the spike in cases, particularly in Florida, which, in a lot of people's eyes, has made Miami suddenly the new Wuhan. That might be a bit of a stretch. But at Miami Beach, they're not taking any chances and, officially, as of today, prohibiting short-term rentals. Now, separately, we will have the mayor of the town of Miami, different from Miami Beach, what he makes of this and these other developments, where they're limiting beach access and social distancing amid these new waves of cases that are going on there. So, it -- these are pretty powerful developments. Then there's the issue of violence in this country, more an issue out West with what's been happening in Seattle and now in Portland. Jonathan Hunt on some very big ones that have police concerned this is getting out of control -- Jonathan. JONATHAN HUNT, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Neil, clashes between police and protesters in Portland last night came during what is the seventh consecutive week of demonstrations in the city. Police said rocks, bottles and ball bearings were thrown at them. They threatened to use tear gas to disperse the crowd, but did not ultimately need to do so. In a separate incident northeast of Seattle, two police officers were involved in a traffic stop. When backup officers arrived, they found that two colleagues had both been shot. One of those to die. The other was treated at a hospital and has now been released. Neither has been identified at this point. The suspect was arrested several hours later. Now, according to the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund, 70 officers have died in the line of duty in 2020, up to July 13. That's down 14 percent from the same period in 2019. Thirty of those killed this year died in firearms incidents, one more than the 29 killed over the same period in 2019. Twenty-seven died in traffic-related accidents, 13 due to other causes. Now, it's worth noting, Neil, that the Officers Memorial Fund keeps a separate tally of those officers who've died as a result of exposure to COVID-19 in the line of duty. That number currently stands at 63, making coronavirus, according to the Memorial Fund, by far the leading cause of law enforcement deaths in 2020 -- Neil. CAVUTO: Thank you, my friend, very, very much. In the meantime, I want to go right now to Mike Solan. He's the Seattle Police Officers Guild president, joining us now via Skype. Mike, it doesn't seem to ease up in your town. And I'm wondering now, efforts to cut the police budget, and maybe substantially, in Seattle, if that's really helping matters any. MIKE SOLAN, PRESIDENT, SEATTLE POLICE OFFICERS GUILD: Hey, Neil. Thanks for having me on again. No, it's absolutely making things worse. And the socialist-leaning city council has our entire reasonable community, which I now referred to as the ignored majority of the citizens of Seattle, hostage by their unreasonable activism. Now they're talking about removing funding 50 percent of us, which would remove two-thirds of the police jobs, which would make the CHOP or CHAZ, if you want to refer to that situation, basically child's play to what kind of crime would besiege our entire city. And you could just imagine what we're all feeling at this point, due to our job security at this point. So it's a very troubling time. And I hope people across this nation realize that Seattle is leading the way as far as how public safety will be conducted coming to you. It's very troubling. CAVUTO: And it is playing out across the country, whether people are fond of the police or not. It's no coincidence there's been an uptick in more violence right now, as there's an all-out assault on police budgets. I'm just wondering, in New York, where they have pared a billion from the police budget, now they're looking to pare more -- obviously, you're familiar with what's going on in Seattle. This is playing out in no fewer than 23 U.S. cities. What's going on? SOLAN: And this has been -- yes, it's a national trend, and it's basically socialism on steroids. It's not at our doorstep anymore. They have breached the door and they're coming through. And please understand that this must be stopped. America needs to wake up as to what is occurring. And if we lose 50 percent of our department, we're talking 1,100 officers gone. Who's left to answer the 911 call to investigate that child rape? You can just imagine. So, please, I understand that if people -- people need to get involved. This ignored majority across our city, and, more importantly, across our nation need to rise up. And if you want to get involved, please assist at = . Please stand up to this unreasonable socialist activism. CAVUTO: I don't know what's going on in Seattle. Mike. I'm familiar with what's happening in New York City, where better than 400 officers have already requested retirement. Some of them are eligible for it, but had held off on it. Now they're flooding the system with such requests. But we're similarly seeing new rookie classes being pared down, frustration over whether it's a good thing to even be a police officer these days. What do you make of all this? SOLAN: Well, I make of it it's dividing us more than uniting us. I mean, we're definitely having people that are retiring early here, looking for jobs elsewhere. But, more importantly, Neil, is that the defund movement is based upon how they view as law enforcement, which they do not respect anymore. And, more importantly, there's a certain city council member that heads the public safety chair on our council that is looking at the possibility of, when officers are terminated or furloughed, based upon this 50 percent cut, they want to dictate those cuts based upon the person's race, which is astronomically, horrifically bad, which violates all laws and just common sense. But that's where we are. That's the level of insanity that we're plagued with by this unreasonable, activist city council that has our ignored majority hostage. And it's very troubling. And you can just imagine the mental health that's impacting our officers is at an all-time high. And you know that suicides by police officers are all -- at the highest level they have ever been. And you can just imagine, with all the protests we have had to deal with, the assaults, the amount of vitriol that was plagued against our membership, now we're dealt with this defund movement, which is national now, which is all socialist-backed propaganda and well-funded, is now we have to deal with this as far as losing our jobs. So, the hits just keep on coming. But I need America rise up here. The ignored majority needs to wake up as to what's occurring. CAVUTO: Mike, thank you very, very much. I always hate talking under these circumstances, but I learn a lot, Mike Solan, the Seattle Police Officers Guild president. Just to keep you up, there are a lot of unintended consequences to the type of violence Mike was outlining, including innocent people caught in the crossfire, and the latest example in New York, a 1-year-old little boy -- after this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0 UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I can't hear him calling me daddy no more. I can't kiss him no more. I can't play with him no more. I can't do nothing with him no more. Like, I have got to put my -- I got to put my son in the ground now. (END VIDEO CLIP) (COMMERCIAL BREAK) CAVUTO: All right, you might want to add Dr. Anthony Fauci to the list of those concerned about putting off kids being in person for school, saying in Georgetown that to keep children in school, because of the impact of keeping children out, that's what's important -- after this. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DAVELL GARDNER SR., FATHER OF SHOOTING VICTIM: I got to put my son in the ground now. And he's only 1, his birthday, two months -- in two months. He didn't live to see 2. Like, he didn't live life. And it's like I wanted to get him out this violence before something like this happened. SAMANTHA GARDNER, GRANDMOTHER OF SHOOTING VICTIM: For the cowards that did this, you should be ashamed of yourself because everybody talk about black lives matter. What about baby lives? (END VIDEO CLIP) CAVUTO: Lawrence Jones has been talking about this for weeks now. When it comes to black lives matter, which matter? Shouldn't they all matter? He joins us right now. Lawrence, this case is particularly shocking, because it's a 1-year-old boy caught up in the crossfire, both literally and figuratively, and now dead. For what, right? For what? LAWRENCE JONES, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Neil, I reported last week about Chicago, what is happening in there. And right now, we're seeing it hit right home here in New York City. Crime, when it comes to shooting, are up 130 percent. I just got some new numbers from the sources, and they say now it's up to 161 percent. This kid was in a stroller when he was gunned down in the middle of a fight. And they still haven't been able to catch the suspects, because no one in the community is talking. Neil, as I continue to say on the network -- and I have been very vocal when it comes to the state abusing its power -- when police get it wrong, I'm on the network reporting on it, getting all the facts. But when an innocent young black life is taken from us, I have to report on that too. And the fact that you're not seeing outrage across the country is concerning to me. Just because this happened in the projects, just because these people were in a poor neighborhood does not mean they're not entitled to life and the same liberties that our audience and people that are in rich neighborhoods are entitled to. CAVUTO: Now that dad to bury a little boy. And I'm wondering. Given everything that's going on, does he blame anyone? Is he just overwhelmed? Does he just think, how did this get so bad so quickly? What? JONES: Well, the dad and the grandmother blame the political leadership. And it's not about a partisan issue. It's the fact that the elected leaders aren't doing anything to prevent this from happening. The AOCs of the world say that this crime is happening because of the coronavirus. Well, that's just simply not true. The crime has been happening in these neighborhoods for a while. And people aren't doing anything about it. The elected leaders don't care about the death, poverty and destruction that have been happening in these communities for a long time. Neil, I don't just talk about these cities, Philly, Detroit, Chicago, New York City. I go to these cities and I talk with the people. And they're begging -- they don't care what ideology you believe in -- for someone to stop the bleeding. And you know what? Neither political party has been able to do it. You got the Democrats that run these neighborhoods. They have failed on it. And then you have the Republicans that don't show up to help solve the problem. So, again, they don't want a political solution. They want a human solution. And I think everybody should care about all of these black lives. CAVUTO: And, as you pointed out, Lawrence, the other day, I mean, this is not an isolated incident. Violent crimes, homicides are up better than 118 percent just over the last six weeks in the New York metropolitan area, up about 70-plus percent in Chicago. It's playing out again and again. And it seems to be spreading. I just talked to a Seattle police chief, who is very concerned about budget cuts there, and how it's going to lead, and has already led to more violence there. This does seem to be permeating the nation. JONES: Well, I will tell you this, Neil. You know me. I'm a libertarian. I'm not ashamed of my ideology. And I believe in cutting. But it doesn't make any sense to cut from the police department when crime is a problem. There's a bunch of other line items that they can cut from right now. If they could point to results by cutting from the police department, then I would be for it. But, right now, it hasn't bared much fruit. You got a billion dollars that has been cut from the New York Police Department. And right now, crime is skyrocketing, especially when it comes to violent crime. So, again, I asked the mayor, is there anything -- maybe look at your wife's proposals that she's gotten. And they're getting millions and millions of dollar. Cut from those areas. But don't come from a police department that is already underwhelmed -- overwhelmed by crime. There are so many unsolved cases currently. Yesterday, just by the numbers, 18 people were shot, one person was killed in New York. Those crimes have not been solved. So, again, does it make sense to continue to cut from a police department that is already begging for more help? CAVUTO: Lawrence Jones, thank you, my friend. I appreciate it, and the insight. JONES: Thanks, brother. CAVUTO: We will keep track of this, because it is spreading everywhere, and the numbers are numbing. All right, when we also come back, Senator Rand Paul will be joining us, talking about what's going on right now, the latest push for stimulus in Washington. He's not a fan of some of the numbers he's been hearing -- after this. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) CAVUTO: All right, there is more stimulus coming. We can tell you that. We don't know how much, but we do know that more is on the way. And maybe by the end of the summer, it will all be put together. Here's the thing, though. We don't have any money to pay for it. In the most recent month of June, we were spending $864 billion more than we were taking in. In other words, the deficit for just one month was $864 billion. It's a familiar theme in what is now increasingly looking like at least a $3 trillion annual deficit. And that might be conservative. Blake Burman on what this could mean going forward. Hey, Blake. BLAKE BURMAN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Hi there, Neil. On that one month of June, just to put that in perspective, more than some fiscal years in total, fiscal years in recent memory. In any event, that eye-popping numbers is not going to slow down the White House as it relates to putting out a phase four relief proposal here, if not in the upcoming days, certainly in the upcoming weeks. The White House spokesperson, Judd Deere, sending me this statement this afternoon, saying -- quote -- \"The White House is sensitive to the rising deficit, which certainly furthers the president's priority that any phase four package be targeted, and one that advances pro-growth policies and incentivizes reemployment.\" The top Republican on the House Ways and Means Committee is Kevin Brady, spoke with you earlier today on \"Cavuto Coast to Coast.\" He continued to tout this idea of a reemployment bonus, which is popular among many Republicans here in Washington. Watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. KEVIN BRADY (R-TX): We know then when unemployment benefits end, the people tend to look for work pretty aggressively. And, right now, we know mainstream businesses are having trouble getting their workers to come back. I do you think a return-to-work bonus or some economic incentive to reconnect those workers is important for both them and that business in a key way. (END VIDEO CLIP) BURMAN: So that's what Republicans are talking about. But Democrats here in Washington are pushing for an extension of that $600 unemployment insurance benefit, that federal plus-up that expires at the end of the month, certainly possible that both sides could meet in the middle. The House speaker, Neil, by the way, Nancy Pelosi, said today that if there is not a deal before Congress takes its summer break in August, that traditional August recess, then she would be in favor of keeping the House here in Washington, before letting them skip town for the entirety of the month. Bottom line here. Neil, both sides hoping to get a deal in the upcoming weeks -- Neil. CAVUTO: All right. Thank you, my friend, Blake Burman, outside the White House reporting on all of that. Let's go to Senator Rand Paul on this. Of course, he's quite a fiscal hawk when it comes to such matters. And that generally gets the ire of even some in his party. So, it's a good time to ask him about this latest stimulus push. What do you think, Senator? Are you for more stimulus? SEN. RAND PAUL (R-KY): Well, we have no money, Neil. There's no rainy day fund. There's no savings account. It's not like we go over to the Federal Reserve, open the safe, and we find out, oh, we have all this money we can give to people. The $3 trillion we have already sent to people because of this government mandated depression has been borrowed. Where are they going to get another trillion dollars? They're going to borrow it. And so I think it's a really, really rotten thing to do. What you have to do is look at the source. The source of the economic depression is the government and the government shutdown of the economy. The government, and particularly the governors, need to get out of the way, let the economy open up, and let individuals assess their risk and act accordingly. CAVUTO: So, when there's talk about extending unemployment benefits, which are very generous on the federal level, or what some of your Republican colleagues have come up with, an incentive to get people to go back to work, you're against both? PAUL: Well, if you pay people not to work, they won't work. If you pay people more not to work than they get for working normally, they won't work. It's called institutional unemployment. So, right now, the institutional unemployment, if you make less than about $50,000 a year, you have got no business working. Why work if the government will give you a free $50,000? If the Democrats get their way, and unemployment goes on for months and months and months, if not years, what will happen is, nobody will work for less than $50,000 in this country, because you can get that for not working. The Republicans' idea, only slightly less stupid. The Republicans are going to give you a bonus to go back to work. Well, where are they getting the money? They're going to borrow it from you. They're going to borrow it from your kids. They're going to borrow it from China. It's a ridiculous notion that we just keep passing out money. Let's get rid of the root cause of this depression. Sometimes, we don't know exactly the cause of the depression. In this one, we do know the cause, the government. The government shut the economy down. The government needs to get the hell out of the way and let us all go back to work, and let each and every one of us assess the risk and make decisions accordingly. CAVUTO: Senator, you're also a doctor. And many school districts and municipalities, including some big ones, Los Angeles and San Diego and Atlanta, are among those saying, we're going to delay the school year because we don't like the spike in cases we're seeing. We think it's risky. So, we're going to put it off. How do you feel about that? PAUL: Well, the teachers union in California also said they won't go back to work until we defund the police and have Medicare for all. So, we have to put this into a bit of perspective. But what I would say is, the media have been scaring people to death. The mortality for children 0 to 18 is one in a million or less. The mortality between 18 years of age and 45 is about 10 in 100,000. So, we need to assess those risks and make decisions. The countries that have opened schools -- 22 countries have opened schools in Europe, and they're doing just fine. They haven't had a surge. The other interesting thing is, when you do contact -- contact tracing, in China, the Netherlands, Britain and in Iceland, what you find is, kids not only rarely get this, rarely die from it, but they rarely transmit it. They're just not good transmitters. And, in general, people who are asymptomatic are not good transmitters. So, the day cares stayed open in New York throughout this for doctors' kids, nurses' kids, hospital janitors' kids, anybody that was associated, firemen, police. The day care stayed open. CAVUTO: Right. PAUL: And guess what? Had very little coronavirus and very few staff members -- about 1 percent of staff members were infected. And most of these staff members, if they're in a reasonable age group, are at very, very low risk of succumbing to this disease. CAVUTO: Well, actually, that puts you kind of on the same page as Dr. Fauci. I know two had your disagreements. He is for opening schools in person. But he did say this about , I guess, an answer to a question about whether he's being slighted by the White House. He said: \"You can trust respected medical authorities. I believe I'm one of them. So, you can trust me. But you need to stick to the data, the science, medical authorities who have a track record of telling the truth. The public can get mixed messages and get confused.\" What do you think of that? PAUL: Well, look, I think Dr. Fauci is well-intentioned. I don't think he's a bad person. I think he wants what's best for the country. But his perspective is that of someone who's always worked for the government and never worked outside of government. So, there's a Dr. Scott Atlas, who is a professor at Stanford, as part of the Hoover Institute, who has a much different and I think much more reasoned perspective. So, what we do is, we listen to a lot of these people. But, ultimately, if we're going to live in a free country, none of these people should get to make a decision for us, for us individually. Each individual should assess the risks and make their choices. Frankly, if you're 18 years old, the rules should be or the advice should be much different than if you're 80 years old, and if you're in a nursing home and you're 85 years old. And so it isn't one-size-fits-all. We can't say, oh, everybody needs to stay at home because someone at the nursing home might get sick. No, let's try to be careful and protect those in the nursing home, but let's open the economy, open the schools. There's a possibility -- and we don't know this yet -- but there's a possibility that this great spike in infections that we're seeing throughout the South, that it may well be enhancing immunity. And it may well be that they reach what I think New York has already reached, a point at which the disease will begin to burn itself out. Interestingly, no one's saying this, but it may not be herd immunity of 60 percent. It may be a break point for the disease that's much less than that. And there are mathematicians who look at this, and they say that the models of herd immunity are based on random behavior and random vaccination. When you get herd immunity from the disease, it's not randomly distributed. And you have some who are very social and some who are less social. But the bottom line is, historically, diseases and viruses have burnout at 25 percent immunity, when you look back at our past. No one knows what the future holds, but I tend to be optimistic that we might get to 20, 25 percent immunity, and the disease may be -- we may be well over -- may be able to overcome the disease at that point. CAVUTO: Very quickly, we will be talking to the mayor of Miami. Now, it's Miami Beach that has already put out a proviso no short-term rentals here, fearing that the thing is -- it's worsening. It's different from Miami, I grant you, but do you think that is an overreaction? PAUL: I think we don't know until we see the death rate. I think that infection rate and testing are complicated, whether things are going up or down. CAVUTO: Right. PAUL: I do believe they are going up and people are infected. Even in my town here, Bowling Green in Kentucky, we meet people every day who are infected. And, to a person, they're all getting better. They're getting mild disease and getting better. So, if they're -- if this is a mild disease in Miami, don't shut it down. If you have an increase in your death rate, and it's significant, maybe you should. CAVUTO: All right. PAUL: But, so far, Florida's doing way better than New York. You wouldn't know that if you watch CNN, but Florida is doing way better than New York. New York had a disaster, a public policy disaster, public health disaster in their nursing homes, due to Democrat Governor Cuomo's decisions. Florida is doing a lot better. But you won't get that from the media that has become so biased and cannot report any of this objectively. CAVUTO: All right. PAUL: It's a disaster. CAVUTO: Senator Rand Paul, thank you very much. I believe the senator was referring to total cases, total hospitalizations, total deaths. Now, when we come back again, the move in Miami Beach right now, not only shut down those beaches, but also prevent people from coming down there for short-term vacation rentals. The mayor of Miami, separate from the beach, on what he makes of that -- after this. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) CAVUTO: All right, first the beaches, and now Miami Beach is telling short-term renters, better luck next time. We really don't want any short- term rentals. So, if you're looking at it, cancel it now. Francis Suarez is the mayor of Miami, again, separate from Miami Beach here. He joins us right now. Mayor, always good to have you. What do you think of this move? Is it justified? FRANCIS SUAREZ (R), MAYOR OF MIAMI, FLORIDA: I think the reason why they're doing it is because South Beach attracts a lot of tourists. And it's very, very difficult to control the crowds. There's large crowds of people... CAVUTO: Right. SUAREZ: ... that are gathered together. So, the whole idea of social distancing kind of goes out the window in South Beach. And I think that's what they're trying to get ahold of. CAVUTO: Do you support a move like that? It's a little different in your neck of the woods. Are you, as well, looking at those who might be coming to your city for a vacation, short- term rentals and the like, that you would consider the same? SUAREZ: Yes, I think, for us, we're always looking at -- and one of the things we have in our city is sort of underground parties, where, basically, bars have been closed by order of the governor. And we see people that basically try to create, recreate a bar in a warehouse. And so we shut down two of those this weekend. We shut down about 10 businesses over the weekend. So, we have been trying to dramatically enforce or increase our enforcement to make sure that, you know, things don't get worse in the city, which is obviously seeing -- and in Dade County, which is obviously seeing record number of cases over the last few days. CAVUTO: You know, Mayor, the greater Miami area has been compared to sort of like the new Wuhan, the new hotbed area of the virus. Do you think that's fair? SUAREZ: You know, that was one of the epidemiologists down here that said that. I think that was -- I don't know if she said that as an epidemiological opinion, expert opinion. But I think -- I think there was 50,000 cases a day in Wuhan. We're nowhere near that, obviously. We're at 3,500. CAVUTO: Right. SUAREZ: I think, in New York, you had a death rate that was at 8 percent. Our death rate is somewhere in the 2 percent range, and our death rate has been stable. We do have an issue with our hospitals very, very close to or very nearing capacity. And we are trying to create more capacity. And we do -- we may have to take some dramatic measures, if things don't improve over the next few weeks. And that's something that we're hoping that we can all together -- we had the governor today. We just came from a meeting with the governor and with all the mayors -- or all the major mayors of major cities -- of many of the major cities in Dade County, so that we can at least communicate whatever we're going to do with one message, because I think it is very important for us to communicate clearly and coherently one message, so that people will follow it. CAVUTO: Are you for kids going back to school in Miami this fall in person? SUAREZ: You know, we had a big discussion about that just a few minutes ago. Right now, obviously, we have a tremendously high amount of cases. I can tell you, personally, my daughter is still not school-ready. So she's not going to be going to school. And, actually, she could have been going into preschool. And my wife is thinking of holding her back. My son, who's 6, will probably do virtual learning, if things don't get better. But there are many families in our community that are in lower income, and they may not have another choice to be able to not send their kids to school, if they want to work. So, right now, what I have understood so far is that parents will be given an option as to whether their kids can go to school or not. That may change, given the circumstances. Obviously, schools are six weeks away from opening. And that's -- hopefully, we will see a significant improvement before that day comes. CAVUTO: Because the governor, I believe, DeSantis, is still on board with schools reopening for in-person classes, as things stand now. Do you support that? SUAREZ: Yes, he definitely -- he definitely does feel that way. He reiterated that. For me, it's more about the circumstances. I -- today, as of right now, with the cases the way they are, and the fact that we're still in phase one, under the CDC guidelines promulgated by the federal government, schools would not be open. CAVUTO: Right. SUAREZ: So, I think we have to see how things are going to evolve over the next six weeks. I can tell you that, if things don't get better over the next week to four weeks, we're going to have a hospital problem, and we're going to have to potentially consider taking some very extreme measures. So, we're trying to communicate to our residents that this is the time for them to take this seriously, to wear their mask in public, and to distance socially, and wash your hands. And we also are seeing that a large percentage of the transmission is at home, people going back home, from a family member. So, we're also messaging that out, so that people are more careful when they get home, and don't just pretend like they didn't potentially get exposed from the outside. CAVUTO: All right, Mayor, best of luck, and to your two little ones there, as you balance that. You're a parent, too, after all, so you have a lot to juggle. Mayor Suarez, thank you very, very much. SUAREZ: Thank you, Neil. CAVUTO: Just focusing on the White House right now. We're minutes away from a presidential press conference. China will be the big issue right now. We have been getting very in your face with the Chinese right now on a whole host of issues, from Hong Kong, to setting up military installations in islands all across the South China Sea. Our Charlie Gasparino has been following all of this, because trade, I guess, Charlie, hangs in the balance, right? CHARLIE GASPARINO, FOX NEWS SENIOR CORRESPONDENT: Yes, I mean, we're a long way from the phase one victory lap that the Trump administration had before the coronavirus. It's -- we are now at a point where there is all-out trade war with China, and it's war on a number of levels. It's an economic war. It's preventing Chinese companies maybe from operating here, like the music app TikTok, as the Trump administration believes that that music app is taking information from its users, mainly kids, but also social influencers, and giving it to the surveillance part of the Chinese government. The Trump administration really blames the Chinese for the coronavirus outbreak. They're on pretty good ground on that one. So, this is not a good time for Chinese-American relations. I will say this. I find it fascinating that the Democrats are chiming in as well. Joe Biden, if you saw some of his economic plans, it's all about stopping trade with China or limiting trade with China. There is a populist consensus in this country that China has done us wrong with the virus, with other -- with other measures. And I think you're going to see that play out through the election. Both sides see it as fertile ground for voters. And to be honest with you, the Trump administration was the first real -- first time anybody -- any administration called out China so blatantly. No one else did in the past. They deserve credit for that. I'm not saying we should have gone the full tariff route. But we -- but the Trump administration went out there and clearly labeled China as a bad player, as a menace to the world economy. Listen, if there's -- there's no better proof than the coronavirus outbreak, which emanated there. So I think you're going to hear Donald Trump ramp up the rhetoric in this. I mean, clearly, from his economic aides, you could -- I have been speaking with them off the record, but Larry Kudlow has been saying it on the record. This is not a good time for the Chinese -- for Chinese-American relations. I can't imagine they're going to is going to be phase two of a trade deal with them, given just how much animosity is out there. So... (CROSSTALK) CAVUTO: And, by the way, Charlie, you're right on that. Catherine Herridge from CBS was interviewing the president on that subject, and he ruled out a phase two trade deal right now, to your quick point here, because phase one just is going nowhere right now. We're waiting for them to deliver the goods, and they're not, right? Real quick. GASPARINO: Yes. I mean, phase one wasn't that big of a deal anyway. It was supposed to be the setup for phase two. But it's the relationship between the two countries now, which has been totally soured by corona, by further talk of espionage. I mean, all's you have to do is look at a music app TikTok, right? CAVUTO: All right. GASPARINO: It's young -- used by young kids. That may be banned because of this. That shows you how far they're going to go in this war -- Neil, back to you. CAVUTO: Oh, it's out of control. All right, thank you, buddy, Charlie Gasparino. We are waiting to hear from the president on this. He will outline all of these plans. Might be an opportunity for him to respond to questions about all these school systems that are delaying their in-person opening. Now, he said that would be a mistake. He no doubt could use this as an opportunity to emphasize that point.

Thanks for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo. Straight ahead right here on \"Sunday Morning Futures\": brand-new polls out on the presidential election coming up. Crime is up across the country, public trust is down, with just 107 days until election 2020, this as Congress returns to work tomorrow to hammer out a new coronavirus relief package before the August recess. They have got two weeks House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy on what to expect, as millions of Americans fear rent protections and extra unemployment benefits are set to expire. White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows is here with an insider's look from the White House, as the screws keep turning on China. Attorney General Bill Barr calls out corporate America for kowtowing to Beijing. Senator John Kennedy will join me with what his move will be next. Also, global investor Ray Dalio is here responding to A.G. Barr's warning about China. Plus, what does all of this mean for the 2020 election? Former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon with his message on President Trump on what it will take to win in November. All that and a lot more, as we look ahead right here, right now on \"Sunday Morning Futures.\" All that coming up, but, first, flags across the Capitol are at half-staff this morning in remembrance of civil rights icon John Lewis. The longtime Georgia congressman passed away Friday night after a battle with pancreatic cancer. He was 80 years old. A great patriot, Lewis was the last living speaker at the 1963 March on Washington, where Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his \"I Have a Dream\" speech. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy was his friend and colleague. He joins me now. Congressman, it is good to see you this morning. My condolences. REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA): Good to see you, Maria. Thank you. And I do want to talk about John Lewis just for a moment, because he lived such an extraordinary life and was an unbelievable man. At such a young age, he tried to cross a bridge simply to give people the right to vote. He did it in a peaceful manner. And he was beaten almost to his death. I have walked across that bridge with him before. And when he would tell the story, he would stop at a moment and says, I cannot remember past beyond this point, because they would beat him. And he did it in a peaceful manner to help change this nation that no longer do people are -- choice about which bathroom they use or which counter they eat on, or even registering to vote. BARTIROMO: Yes. MCCARTHY: He made this nation better. And he lived his life in a manner that we can all respect and live up to. And he was kind to all. And he -- I just spoke to him a couple weeks ago, checking on his health, but talking to him about what's happening in the nation today, because he did it in a peaceful manner to help preserve and to actually create a more perfect union. I think can -- a lot to understand him and live by his example to make this nation better. BARTIROMO: Yes, thank you for that. When we go to break, after our interview, we're going to show a little clip of John Lewis, which is a beautiful clip and something that I know that our audience will love. So, stay with us for that. But let me get to the business at hand for our viewers. And you're going back to -- Congress will return to work tomorrow. And you are looking at a potential next stimulus package, a relief package. What should be in that package, Congressman? MCCARTHY: A number of things should be in that package. But we also have a large amount of money, more than about $1.5 trillion, still out there that we have already appropriated that we need to get into this economy. But the things I look for are the things we need to do. We need liability of protection, because these small businesses are questioning whether they can open again, our schools and others. So, let's protect those as we move forward. Let's also look at, any time you're using federal money, it shouldn't give you a -- de-incentivize the ability to work. We have made a mistake where we overpaid on unemployment insurance, where now it's hard for people to come back to work because they're making more on unemployment than they can working. So we have got to straighten that out as we move forward. I would look at places that we could -- should prioritize the safety when it comes to child care or for our children and our teachers inside schools. And then I would look at the supply chain. If we learn nothing from this, not the lies of China, but bringing those jobs back to America, but also our supply chain itself, not being beholden to China for so much of our critical minerals and others. Let's find a way that we improve it here and for our stockpiling. I would do that in a different manner, working with the private sector to stockpile it. BARTIROMO: Well, so the president would like schools to open in the fall, Congressman. Will there be money in this next bill for schools? And what about the states? Are these the priorities right now for that next bill? MCCARTHY: Well, the uniqueness of what we have right now, Maria, we have more than $100 billion that we have already appropriated that can go to the states. I think we can look at ways that we can make that greater flexibility. And lots of times, we're finding, when we sent these moneys to these governors, that they have held it up, instead of pushing it down to the counties and the cities. I would like to see more flexibility, where it goes to the counties and cities in the place of need. We would look at hospitals if they need more in the process of where we're going forward. BARTIROMO: Yes. MCCARTHY: We also have more than $100 billion sitting there for such a successful program of PPP for small businesses that saved millions of jobs. Now we're seeing that some states have to close certain portions. Is there a greater need for small businesses? We already have money sitting there. BARTIROMO: Well... MCCARTHY: So, could we use the money already appropriated to solve some of these problems? BARTIROMO: Sure. I understand. But, you know, the Democrats are pushing back on the president saying he wants to open schools. And I wonder how much of this is politics, although, you know, it is scary for parents to say, we're going to send our kids back to school, and we don't know what the situation is in terms of the coronavirus. We're seeing spikes across the country. Here is what President Trump told me just recently when I interviewed him at the beginning of this pandemic. Listen to this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BARTIROMO: Your critics want you to keep it closed going into the election? DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Yes, I do. I do. I think it's a political thing, in addition. I think some sense... BARTIROMO: Because they're saying you're putting money, business ahead of lives. TRUMP: No, no. I think the people that want to see the right thing happen, they agree with me. We have to get our country open. You know, if it was up to some people, let's keep it closed for a long time, OK, a long time. And watch the United States go down the tubes. Not going to happen. (END VIDEO CLIP) BARTIROMO: I mean, I guess we are going to be living with this, Congressman. But can we actually go back to our normal lives safely right now, given these spikes that we're seeing across the country? MCCARTHY: In certain parts of the country, you can. Nobody wants to send somebody to school that's unsafe. That's why Congress should actually look at this. How can we protect when it comes to child care, the children in school and the teachers? But what's more important, when you look at these recent studies, you're finding that children can -- should not -- have not kept their reading, their writing and their math, losing more than 30 percent of it. We cannot have a whole generation that's uneducated. BARTIROMO: Yes. MCCARTHY: So, what we need to do is actually put that plan together, because we have got to make sure schools can reopen. And that takes a responsibility of what we're doing. Now we're finding, even in California, where L.A. and San Diego say they're not going to open for the whole year? BARTIROMO: Wow. MCCARTHY: Remember what is happening here with Warp Speed. We have got five companies that are in BARDA that have a real promise of having a vaccine, could even be this year, or the therapies that are coming forward. Tomorrow is going to be better than today, based upon what this administration is doing. BARTIROMO: Yes, but look what is happening to our cities. MCCARTHY: Yes. BARTIROMO: Look what's happening to our cities. I know you have a bill right now to punish anybody who is taking down statues. But there's a massive movement across the country on the other side of the aisle. Your colleagues on the left, they want to defund the police. Listen to Joe Biden recently. Here it is. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) QUESTION: Can we agree that we can redirect some of the funding? JOSEPH BIDEN (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Yes, absolutely. One of the things that we also need to be doing is fundamentally changing the way -- and I have been pushing it for years -- changing the way we deal with our prison system. It should be a rehabilitation system, not a punishment system. (END VIDEO CLIP) BARTIROMO: Well, what does that mean, Congressman? Because we are seeing this bail reform in New York allow criminals back on the street. And that's one of the reasons crime is skyrocketing. What is your responsibility, as the leader of the GOP, to get law and order back in place in this country? MCCARTHY: Well, every American should be scared right now, because what you just showed country was Joe Biden said, yes, he is for defunding the police. You have got Congresswoman Omar, who wants to dismantle America. Then you have got Nancy Pelosi, who is allowing them to destroy America from statues and on. We have a responsibility for rule and law and for justice. And what we're watching the Democrats doing -- watch what Nancy Pelosi just said the other day. She thinks what's happening is -- in Portland is a graffiti problem. No, it's a mob problem that is overrunning. You have people across this nation scared to death. You have young children being murdered... BARTIROMO: Yes. MCCARTHY: ... because what they're doing to the police department. This is wrong. I introduced a bill... BARTIROMO: So, your bill -- your bill does what? MCCARTHY: When law... BARTIROMO: Yes. MCCARTHY: Our bill will withhold federal grants for cities that do not uphold and protect the statues... BARTIROMO: OK. MCCARTHY: ... because the cities have the responsibility for law and order, not to leave these precincts, not to allow these mobs to rule our communities. BARTIROMO: Wow. Yes. MCCARTHY: We have to stand up to this. BARTIROMO: It is scary out there. I agree with you. Congressman, it's good to see you this morning. We certainly will be watching the developments. Thanks so much, Congressman Kevin McCarthy, this morning. We will see you soon, sir. Thank you. Coming up: White House chief of staff Mark Meadows on the hot seat over the administration's response to the coronavirus. As we take a break, a look at the late, great John Lewis. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BARTIROMO: Welcome back. We have got new FOX News polls released this morning. And it shows coronavirus is the number one issue for voters headed into the 2020 election. More than half of them disapprove of how the president has handled this pandemic. I'm joined right now by the White House's chief of staff, Mark Meadows. He has been leading the administration through this crisis. And, Mark, it is good to have you this morning. Thanks very much for joining us. First off, what can you say to your critics who say the president has fallen short in his response to the pandemic? MARK MEADOWS, WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF: Well, obviously, any time that we get faced with something that is new and unusual, you actually have to engage. And so this came from China. In the last four or five months, we have been having to figure out how to provide personal protective equipment, ventilators, making sure that we have hospital beds. And I can tell you, as we look forward, there are a number of things that we're working on to make sure that we have the therapeutics, even as recent as, this morning, shipments going to Florida and Indiana and other places to make sure that some of the treatments that are needed in these critical areas are actually happening. And I also can tell you that it's a 24/7 around-the-clock kind of work. I was on the phone with the president this morning, as we were working on some of the responses. You will see some new initiatives coming out this week, as the president is not only leading, but will continue to lead and step in a number of fronts. One of those that you just mentioned earlier, Maria, is about our schools. How are we going to open our schools and make sure that moms and dads don't have to worry about the safety of our children that are going back to schools? And so there will be over $70 billion that this president has already authorized to work with Congress to try to make sure that we not only keep the classrooms safe, but the teachers safe and the students safe. BARTIROMO: Right. MEADOWS: And you will see a very broad five to six points in terms of what we will be doing in terms of making sure that our schools are safe. BARTIROMO: That's really important. Obviously, we are going to have to live with this for a little while, before we get the innovation from our pharma sector and a vaccine. Tell me what the president would like to see in another relief package, Mark. Where are we in terms of the relief and the impact on the economy and people's livelihoods? MEADOWS: Well, there's -- the discussions have just started over the last week or so. We have been having a number of internal discussions over the last couple of months. But, as we have started to engage with our Senate and House colleagues up on Capitol Hill, those will start in earnest starting tomorrow. Monday, I know that Leader McConnell and Leader McCarthy will be coming into meet with the president and Steven Mnuchin, who is leading it from our side, to actually start to fine-tune it. So I'd see there's three different areas that we're going to make sure of, that we have enough money to make sure that we expedite not only the Warp Speed as it relates to the treatments that we have, whether it be therapeutics or vaccines, but we also want to make sure that we keep people employed. When you look at the economy and where we need to go with it, we're not going to be shy about making sure that we have protections for the American worker and those that employ individuals. And so you're going to see an additional thrust there. It looks like that that new package will be in the trillion-dollar range, as we have started to look at it, whether it's a payroll tax deduction, whether it's making sure that unemployment benefits continue, without a disincentive to return to work. And then, bluntly, we're looking at a number of areas to look at manufacturing, bringing some of those critical manufacturing jobs back from overseas, so that we're never put in a situation where we have to depend on foreign countries to make sure that we can protect Americans. BARTIROMO: And the president has talked about the crime across the country as well. Is there something coming in terms of an executive order on returning law and order to this country? MEADOWS: Well, he's already done a couple of things. But he's working very closely with Attorney General Barr. I can tell you that, this week, what we're looking at is not only looking at what a lot of people have called the executive order on statues, which he did that. But that's really -- the statues are one thing, but it's really about keeping our communities safe. And the president's committed to do that. Some of the unrest that we saw even in the last month or so, but particularly last night and the week leading up to it, in Portland, it's just not acceptable, when you look at communities not being safe and not upholding the rule of law. BARTIROMO: Yes. That's right. MEADOWS: So, Attorney General Barr is weighing in on that, with Secretary Wolf. And you will see something rolled out this week as we start to go in and make sure that the communities, whether it's Chicago, or Portland, or Milwaukee, or someplace across the heartland of the country. We need to make sure that our communities are safe. BARTIROMO: Mark, let me turn to the Russia probe. You did such an excellent job when you were on the Oversight Committee in terms of zeroing in on the origins of the Russia probe. We now know, for sure -- Lindsey Graham told us this about a month ago, actually, so our audience was aware, that the FBI knew that the dossier was just made-up garbage, and the subsource told the FBI agents that. And yet Jim Comey and Andrew McCabe kept on pushing forward, renewing warrants to spy on Carter Page. Your reaction to what we know now. And when are we going to hear from John Durham? Will there be indictments, sir? MEADOWS: Well, I think the American people expect indictments. I know I expect indictments, based on the evidence I have seen. Lindsey Graham did a good job in getting that out. We know that they not only knew that there wasn't a case, but they continued to investigate and spy -- and, yes, I use the word spy -- on Trump campaign officials, and, actually, even doing things when this president was sworn in, and after that, and doing it in an inappropriate manner. You're going to see a couple of other documents come out in the coming days that will suggest that, not only was the campaign spied on, but the FBI did not act appropriately as they were investigating. It's all starting to come unravel -- to unravel. And I tell you, it's time that people go to jail and people are indicted. BARTIROMO: It's just unbelievable that, for three years, this president was investigated and investigated again over something that wasn't even true, and the entire country was up in arms about collusion. I mean, you know, I don't hear anything on the other side of the aisle about this wrongdoing, which is just stunning to me. MEADOWS: Well, it is stunning. And here is the interesting thing is, it's not only that it wasn't true. The problem is, they knew it wasn't true. BARTIROMO: Right. MEADOWS: And when you know something is not true, and you continue the investigation, that's collusion. That's the kind of thing that we must stop. And that's what we -- where we need to hold people accountable. BARTIROMO: Mark, it's great to have you this morning. Please come back soon. Thanks so much. MEADOWS: Thanks, Maria. BARTIROMO: Mark Meadows joining us there. Coming up next, Louisiana Senator John Kennedy with breaking news on what to expect from the Senate, as we look ahead on \"Sunday Morning Futures.\" Stay with us. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Lawmakers are returning to Washington tomorrow to negotiate the next coronavirus relief package, but can both sides reach an agreement before millions of Americans lose their extra unemployment benefits at the end of July? Joining me right now with his expectations for a bill is Louisiana Senator John Kennedy. He serves on the Banking, Budget and Appropriations Committee. Sir, it's great to see you this morning. Thanks so much for joining me. SEN. JOHN KENNEDY (R-LA): You bet. BARTIROMO: What are your priorities for a next stimulus bill? Do you want to get something out before the recess starts again on August 8? KENNEDY: Well, it depends on what's in the bill, Maria. I don't know what's going to be in the bill. I don't know if there will be a bill. And, frankly, neither does anyone else. It takes 60 votes to pass a bill in the Senate. The only thing I'm certain of right now is that the bill we pass, if we pass one, will not be Speaker Pelosi's bill. It is untethered to reality. And among most senators, including many Democrats, it's about as popular as a sinkhole. Among the topics that we will talk about will be, number one, maybe the most important, getting our schools open, money, extra money for K-12. Most fair-minded people believe that keeping our schools closed will do far more damage to our kids than the coronavirus ever can. Having said that, I know a lot of parents are scared. If you don't want to send your child back to school, you shouldn't, and you shouldn't be forced to. And if you're a teacher or an employee, and you don't want to go back, don't. That's between you and the school board. But I think we will have enough kids, enough teachers, and enough employees, with the right resources, to get our schools open. We probably shouldn't have closed them down to begin with. BARTIROMO: There is also some consensus on limiting ability for businesses, schools, and government in terms of their liability. Is there consensus there? Will that be in the next bill? KENNEDY: There's not a consensus on anything. But the other issues we will talk about will be, as you pointed out, limiting liability for our schools and our universities and our hospitals. We will work on trying to give relief to people laid off who lose their health insurance. We will talk about additional PPP. We will talk about additional unemployment compensation. Payroll tax cut will be on the table, as will direct stimulus payments to American people. BARTIROMO: OK. KENNEDY: But, again, there's not a -- there's not even close to a consensus yet. BARTIROMO: You are also working on a bill. I want to move on to China. You're working on a bill that will prohibit American companies from collaborating with the Chinese Communist Party. A really stunning speech this week by Attorney General Bill Barr. Let's hear that. And then I want to get your take on where we are with China. Here is Bill Barr. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WILLIAM BARR, U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL: The ultimate ambition of China's rulers isn't to trade with the United States. It is to raid the United States. If you are an American business leader, appeasing the PRC may bring short- term rewards, but, in the end, the PRC's goal is to replace you. (END VIDEO CLIP) BARTIROMO: Pretty stunning comments there, Senator. What can you tell us about this? The A.G. called out technology companies Cisco, Google, Microsoft, Yahoo, Apple, all by name. What is at stake if these companies continue working with China? KENNEDY: General Barr, in my estimation, is absolutely correct. The Chinese people are wonderful people, but their government, the Communist Party of China, is comprised of a bunch of outlaws. They're bullies. They understand only strength. If you're too nice to them, if you turn the other cheek, they just stab you in the neck. The poster child for what the general was talking about is the leadership at the National Basketball Association. The NBA leadership is so greedy, so anxious to do business in China that they do whatever the Chinese Communist Party tells them to do. If the party told the leadership of the NBA to join the Taliban, the NBA leadership would say, where's the line? I'm working on a bill that would prohibit American companies from giving in to this bullying by the Communist Party of China. It would say, basically, if you give in to them, you violate American law. Now, it's a delicate bill to draft, and we're working on it. BARTIROMO: Yes. KENNEDY: But Barr is right. BARTIROMO: We want to show you this video of the Uyghurs in China. Now, this video was shot in 2018, so it's not new. But what it clearly shows are the Muslims and the Tibetans that are locked up in camps in China. They are blindfolded. They are being lined up. And what can you tell us? What is the responsibility of the free world to take a stand against these people being locked up in China? The Chinese Communist Party has pushed back and said, it's none of your business what goes on in other countries, Senator. KENNEDY: \u00a0Well, in my estimation, what the Chinese Communist Party has done to the Tibetans and the Uyghurs is despicable. All the Tibetans and the Uyghurs want to do is practice their religion. And the Communist Party in China says, your religion is the Communist Party of China. And we have to stand up to them, not just other governments, other Western democracies, but those who value free enterprise as well. And for those of my colleagues on Capitol Hill who admire the authoritarian socialist approach of countries like China... BARTIROMO: Yes. KENNEDY: ... I will just tell you, look at the Uyghurs, look at the Tibetans. Look what China is doing now, causing mischief with India, in the South China Sea, in Hong Kong. All they understand is -- I don't want to start a cold war with China, but weakness invites the wolves. And we have to be firm with them. BARTIROMO: Yes. And, on Thursday, the president signed the Hong Kong sanctions bill, unanimously passed by the bipartisan Senate. This is an important message. I just will point out that China has already sanctioned Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz. (LAUGHTER) BARTIROMO: And they say that this is holding -- this is for them holding CCP officials accountable for what's going on in China, Senator, real quick. KENNEDY: I think Ted and Marco probably will wear the sanctions as a badge of honor. For 20 years, we have been told by the commentariat that we have to be patient with China, that free enterprise will change them. BARTIROMO: Yes. KENNEDY: They're trying to change free enterprise. BARTIROMO: Senator, thank you so much. We will be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Well, it is 107 days until America will vote for its next president, in what could be one of the most important policy-based elections in history. My next guest knows what it takes to win the White House. He helped lead Donald Trump to victory in 2016 as the chief executive of his campaign. Joining me right now is once again former White House chief strategist, host of \"War Room: Pandemic,\" Steve Bannon. Steve, it's great to see you this morning. Thanks for being here. We want to roll out these polls this morning from FOX News and get your take on all of this, because, once again, we see the president lagging. What do you think is going on? Here is President Trump on the economy, 47 percent approve, 47 percent disapprove, Steve. And then you have got other polls which show the president lagging Joe Biden. Your take? STEVE BANNON, FORMER WHITE HOUSE CHIEF STRATEGIST: Listen, when you go back and look in -- I think it was in March, 51 percent of the American people thought President Trump was doing a good job, a solid job in leadership on this pandemic. I think, in the poll, it's 37, 38 percent, something like this. This is about just bold action and bold leadership. What I think the president should do, my recommendation would be, every day, start to have the top people around you, Dr. Fauci, Dr. Birx, the vice president, Dr. Redfield at CDC, Chief of Staff Meadows, have them in the Oval, get briefed every day on an action plan, just drive action, action, action, and do it through action, urgency, and focus. And get a plan for masks. Get a plan for the schools. Bring the governors in, but with those five people around the desk. And then every couple of days, you bring in the media, and you tell them what the plan of the day is. You tell them where we're driving action. President Trump is a man of action. When he's taken action on whether shutting down China, shutting down Europe, declaring this a national emergency, when President Trump is taking action, the polls reflect this. I would -- I think the polls should be an indication to people in the White House that, hey, you're in the driver's seat here. Just go back to the plan you have got. And, also, you have made a decision about federalism, I think, is very smart, but include the governors now, particularly as this kind of weaponized virus is impervious to summer heat and humidity. It also is asymptomatic. It also targets and looks like it targets the most vulnerable. And so this is where they have to have, I think, targeted interventions. I think Dr. Birx has talked about this in the past. The White House has all the elements. I think it's just bringing it together around President Trump in a principals only, and every couple of days bring the media in there and let President Trump explain what actions he's taking, not one of these two- hour press conferences, where the media can throw out all these other questions. But focus on the pandemic. If you focus on the pandemic, you will start to make real progress. And I think the polls will all start to fall in place. Remember, the CCP lied. Americans died. I think the president can take leadership in this and drive this. And I think the polls will take care of themselves. BARTIROMO: What can you say about Joe Biden's plans right now, Steve? This week, the former vice president unveiled a climate plan to cost $2 trillion. Look, he is going to be raising taxes. He's already discussed that, that he's going to be raising taxes. If Elizabeth Warren is his running mate, she -- or not -- she could be Treasury secretary, but she will certainly be an important, key voice in the economy. She wants to institute a wealth tax. You know, look, we are facing a $22 trillion debt. And you would say, OK, you have to raise taxes in that regard. But he's using that higher revenue to come up with things like a $2 trillion green plan. What's your take on Biden's agenda? BANNON: Look, Biden doesn't know what his agenda is. He's trying to reinvent himself every other day. He goes up to Scranton, Pennsylvania, and makes this kind of populist economic nationalist speech. He's really the concierge of Wilmington, Delaware, which is the headquarters of all the global corporations. You know, Joe Biden, to me, has to come forward to the American people and tell what his plan on China is. The president's kind of war council has laid out the four horsemen of the Apocalypse against the Chinese Communist Party, the national security adviser, head of the FBI, the secretary of state, and then obviously Secretary -- Attorney General Barr in that magnificent speech. Those four individuals laid out an integrated and coherent war plan to confront the Chinese Communist Party on technological and information war and economic war, and then, with our allies, start to open up the South China Sea, and support our allies in India on the border of Chinese- occupied Tibet. You're seeing an integrated war plan put together to take down -- confront first and then take down the Chinese Communist Party, to call their bluff. And Joe Biden, in his entire speech the other day on economics, mentioned China, I think, one time, talking about electric vehicles. Joe Biden is the candidate of globalization. He's a total globalist. He has kowtowed to the Chinese Communist Party. The president has a coherent plan against the Chinese Communist Party. I would like the secretary of Treasury to join in there and Treasury to start to drop the hammer. But you have seen a coherent war plan. I think you have just got to get that same level of coherence on the Chinese virus that's here, the CCP virus that has come to the United States. And I think, if you do that, things will come together. And I don't think Joe Biden has an answer. So far, it's been virtually incoherent. BARTIROMO: Yes, I want to come back to the China story in a second. But who do you think Joe Biden will choose as his vice presidential candidate? BANNON: Well, I think the polling internal to Biden, the number one thing they're looking at is somebody that can't -- that can't throw him off the - - where he's going right now. So, I think whether it's Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris, I think they're looking at a number of candidates. I don't think it's going to matter, at the end of the day, who his V.P. is, because, really, I think Joe Biden is the one that is going to get smoked out. If President Trump continues to drive action, that -- and Biden is going to be smoked out and going to have to really confront President Trump on the hustings. And I just don't think he's going to stand up. BARTIROMO: Yes. BANNON: Right now, remember, he -- nothing he puts forward is really coherent. And he's trying to reform himself as a -- or rebrand himself as a populist and economic nationalist, against 45 years of his track record. It is going to be very, very difficult, as the Trump campaign, as a full -- force multiplier off of what's happening at the White House, I think, begins to really identify and kind of brand Joe Biden for what he is. BARTIROMO: Yes, that was an incredible speech that A.G. Barr made this week, basically calling out corporate America, Steve, to say, look, you can not collaborate with the Chinese Communist Party, that you are putting profits over the short term ahead of the real issues around national security over the long term. Do you think, increasingly, companies are getting it, or are they still seeing the opportunity to sell widgets to 1.4 billion people? BANNON: Well, they better get it, because he put a shot across their bow when he talked about FARA, and he said, hey, not only -- he used the word - - remember, this is a very smart guy. He used collaborator and appeasement, OK, collaboration and appeasement. Those words were specifically chosen by Attorney General Barr to put corporate America on notice. Then he talked about FARA. He talked about you guys being lobbyists and actually being unregistered foreign agents. So this is something that he really threw down on. And I have got to tell you, it was a magnificent speech. The other ones of the NSA director, of the FBI director, of Pompeo also have to be reviewed in an entire context of where President Trump is taking this, really, I think, as a war leader, on economic and information war. What we have to do today is then stop playing games with the CCP. Stop being a supplicant about this virus. We have to tell them, I believe, you turn over every piece of information, you open up the P4 lab, you let Americans and other scientists from around the world go in there and interview everybody, get every document, or we're going to cut you off. We're going to cut you off from the U.S. dollar. We're going to sanction your banks. BARTIROMO: Wow. BANNON: And we're going to sanction the highest members of the Chinese Communist Party, Wang Qishan and Xi. It's time for -- President Trump has got a great saying: no games. It's time to stop playing games with this murderous dictatorship. BARTIROMO: Yes. BANNON: They lied. The American people have died. Their own people have suffered immensely. BARTIROMO: Wow. BANNON: The Communist Party -- people -- the Chinese Communist people -- the people there are innocent victims of this dictatorship. Bill Barr called it out. Right now, Secretary of State Pompeo has to say, you open up every lab. BARTIROMO: Yes. BANNON: And the secretary of Treasury should come in, with the backing of the president of the United States... BARTIROMO: Yes. BANNON: ... and say, we're off the dollar. We're sanctioning every bank. We're going to sanction individuals, until you come clean. BARTIROMO: Oh, my goodness. BANNON: And we're going to get therapeutics and a vaccine and know exactly what this thing is. Listen, this thing being asymptomatic, this thing being... BARTIROMO: Yes. BANNON: \u00a0... impervious to humidity and heat, this thing targeting the most vulnerable population, the aged, comorbidities, minorities... BARTIROMO: OK. BANNON: ... this virus, we know very little about. It's time for them to stop hiding the information. BARTIROMO: All right, we got to jump. My next guest will have a thing or two to say about that. I will speak with Ray Dalio, global investor. Steve Bannon, thank you so much. We will be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Attorney General Bill Barr this week called on American companies to stop appeasing the Chinese Communist Party, saying -- quote -- \"The ultimate ambition of China's rulers is not to trade with the United States. It is to raid the United States. If you are an American business leader, appeasing the PRC may bring short-term rewards, but, in the end, the PRC's goal is to replace you\" -- from A.G. Bill Barr this week. Joining me right now is the co-chief investment officer, the co-chairman and the founder of Bridgewater Associates, Ray Dalio, who has studied China and dynasties for decades. Ray, it's great to have you this morning. Thanks so much for joining us. RAY DALIO, CO-CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER/CO-CHAIRMAN, BRIDGEWATER ASSOCIATES: \u00a0Good to be here. BARTIROMO: And I know that you have been to China many times. You have invested in China. What is your reaction to what you're hearing from Bill Barr, Ray? DALIO: Well, look, I'm a mechanic. I'm -- I just look at cause-effect relationships and what things are like, and so not ideological. I have been to China, as you say, for 35 years. And I watch them. And I -- we're operating in a world in which they are a, let's call it, worthy opponent, that each country seeks to do what's in its own interest. And there's a battle over wealth and power. And that's internal or external. And each company, when they go there, forms their own view about what it's like. And then there's law. And so the way I view that comment or that assessment is that, if the government is going to do something that will have an effect, they will have to create laws, and that those laws will determine what companies are going to do. They will behave according to those laws. BARTIROMO: Right. DALIO: Otherwise, you're going to have individual companies make their own assessments. And from my assessment of going to China and being there, it's not like the China that is being painted. It's not this communist -- it is highly capitalist. The enterprise system is operating, meaning, you go there, and the innovation and the things are powerful. And that's why you're seeing so many issues with competition. It's -- Huawei is about competition. And their technologies are quite amazing. So, it is a definitely worthy opponent. BARTIROMO: Yes. DALIO: And what's happening now, in the rise of a great power to challenge an existing great power, is the same sort of thing that's happened in the 1930-to-'45 period. So I hope we have a chance to talk about that, because there are other things that are related... BARTIROMO: Yes. DALIO: ... that all come together to determine -- to set the stage that we're now in. BARTIROMO: Well, I want to talk more about this, because you say Huawei is quite competitive, but isn't Huawei a collection of assets of Nortel Networks? Was many of those assets stolen? I mean, how do you look at China as a player that is just a competitor, when, in fact, they may very well be stealing intellectual property? I want to get into that when you -- when we come back. Let's take a short break. We're talking with Ray Dalio this morning. And he's not only looking at China, but the enormous amount of stimulus thrown at this economy. We will get into it when we come right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) \u00a0BARTIROMO: And we are back with Bridgewater's co-chairman and co- investments officer, Ray Dalio. And, Ray, we were talking about China. I do want to get into the broader economy and the impact there. You have been studying stimulus, in terms of all of this money being thrown at this economy. What do you think the implications are, Ray? DALIO: I'm going to pick up quickly with your China piece, and then I will come to the other. I'm just a practical man who has studied histories. And what's happening now has happened all through the history. In particular, I studied the rises and declines of empires and the reserve currency, starting with the Dutch -- they had the world empire -- the British, the United States, and now. BARTIROMO: Right. DALIO: And through that period of time, there is what you call stealing. There has always been the taking of ideas. The British took, hired architects, who took from the Dutch, who had the shipbuilding. And that was their main competitive advantage. It's a reality. And I think it's important to see that arc. Part of that arc, as you're referring to, has... BARTIROMO: It's an important point. DALIO: Sorry? Part of... BARTIROMO: I said it's an important point that you're making. DALIO: Yes. There's an arc in which it's like competition. They might -- internally, you might say somebody's stealing their ideas. Well, that's right. I mean, that's just the practicality. And in the world, you don't have the same kind of rules. It's more of a jungle. You don't have laws. And so it's just a practicality... (CROSSTALK) BARTIROMO: So, should we just say, well, China is going to beat us? I mean, should we just sit back and say, well, look, this is a threat and that's it? DALIO: No. No, I think you just have to see it for what it is, and deal with it well, right? In other words, don't deal with it emotionally. Approach it like a chess game. If I make this move, it will have this implication. And so I think, if it was clear -- questions like, do you want to go to war? There is -- there are four types of wars brewing. There is a trade war, there's a technology war, there's a geopolitical war, and there might be a capital war. BARTIROMO: Yes. DALIO: And so just do you want to approach it as that? How do you approach it intelligently to win that war? Our biggest issue is our own... BARTIROMO: Ray, we really need to talk about the economy. We need to talk about the economy. We hope you will come back next weekend, Ray. Thank you so much, Ray Dalio joining us. And that'll do it for \"Sunday Morning Futures.\" I'm Maria Bartiromo.

If we don\u2019t restore the balance between the natural world and the human one, these outbreaks will become increasingly prevalent.\u201dThe report cited how COVID-19, which has already caused more than half a million deaths around the world -- likely originated in bats --\u00a0while others have suggested the virus originated in a Wuhan lab.The increasing\u00a0emergence of zoonotic diseases are believed to be tied to rising trends that include the growing demand for animal protein; a rise in intense and unsustainable farming; the expanding use and exploitation of wildlife; and the climate crisis, according to the report.\u00a0Wild animals including rodents, bats, carnivores, and non-human primates\u00a0are those\u00a0most likely to harbor and transmit zoonotic pathogens to humans.UNEP and the\u00a0International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI)\u00a0are urging governments to adopt an approach called \",\" which involves pulling experts in human, animal, environmental health to combat zoonotic disease outbreaks. Together, the experts can help\u00a0monitor, control public health threats and learn how diseases spread among people, animals, plants, and the environment. added that in low to middle-income countries, endemic zoonotic diseases associated with livestock production result in more than two million deaths a year. African countries, however, have had success in managing those types of diseases and the report believes they can serve as a blueprint for tackling\u00a0future outbreaks.\"To prevent future outbreaks, countries need to conserve wild habitats, promote sustainable agriculture, strengthen food safety standards, monitor and regulate food markets, invest in technology to identify risks, and curb the illegal trade in wildlife,\"\u00a0U.N.

I'm Mike Emanuel in for Bret Baier. President Trump is taking a quick trip to Mount Rushmore to watch some July third fireworks along with thousands of people. The event comes despite the U.S. reporting another record high in new coronavirus cases today. In his speech tonight, President Trump is expected to speak about the history of America and warned against those he sees trying to divide the country. We will have life coverage of the big event tonight at 10:00 p.m. Eastern. The president will return to Washington well past midnight to prepare for tomorrow's festivities back home at the White House. That's where we begin tonight with Correspondent Mark Meredith on the North Lawn. Good evening, Mark. MARK MEREDITH, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Good evening to you, Mike. At this hour, the president and first lady, they are in the air making their way to Mount Rushmore for that fireworks as you also mentioned, they'll be having a remarks tonight. While they are there in South Dakota, we expect the president is going to call out cancel culture and also criticize those that want to tear down monuments in the name of rewriting American history. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We're going to Mount Rushmore. MEREDITH: President Trump is kicking off his holiday weekend with a trip to South Dakota's Mount Rushmore where at least 75,000 people are expected to watch a fireworks extravaganza. TRUMP: I'll be seeing a lot of people, a lot of different people. And I think it will be a fantastic evening. MEREDITH: Organizers say masks will be provided but people won't be required to wear them. Meantime, some Native American tribes who calls South Dakota home are protesting the visit, they want Mount Rushmore torn down. The leader of the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe writing, we are the ones who live under the stare of those who have wronged us. On Saturday, the president will host a salute to America event. The White House inviting front-line workers including doctors and nurses to the celebration while tens of thousands are expected to gather on the National Mall for a military flyover and fireworks. Mall goers are encouraged to practice social distancing. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: CDC says larger gatherings are a higher risk. You have to take that into account again with whether or not you're at risk, whether you live with someone who is vulnerable and then you have to take measures to say safe. MEREDITH: As several states experience a surging COVID cases, Dr. Anthony Fauci says the virus itself may be mutating, essentially allowing it to spread more easily. But he says more research is needed to know for sure. DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES: It just seems that the virus replicates better and may be more transmissible, but this is still at the stage of trying to confirm that. MEREDITH: President Trump tweeted Thursday, the increase in cases is easy to explain, writing, quote, there's a rising coronavirus cases because our testing is so massive and so good. Far bigger and better than any other country. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Joe Biden can't fix our economy. MEREDITH: The president's campaign is focused elsewhere. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Trade deals that let China and Mexico steal our jobs. MEREDITH: The Trump campaign released this new T.V. ad today only hours after the June jobs report showed 4.8 million jobs were added last month. The ad maybe the most clear sign yet the Trump campaign hopes to win voters over by appealing directly to people's pocketbooks. (END VIDEOTAPE) MEREDITH: In his remarks tonight, the president expected to call America a great and virtuous country but he's also going to say some of the chaos that we've seen these last couple of weeks is a responsibility of a left- wing mob, Mike. EMANUEL: Mark Meredith leading us off on the North Lawn. Mark, many thanks. The way that spikes started in the South moved West, but now at least 40 states are seeing climbing new coronavirus cases. Governors have ordered the wearing of masks in public and families are being urged to celebrate Independence Day at home. Correspondent Jonathan Serrie is in Atlanta looking at the concerning coronavirus trends across the country. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) TERRENCE REIDY, UNDERSECRETARY, MASSACHUSETTS PUBLIC SAFETY: The virus isn't taking a holiday. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Feel pain anywhere? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No. JONATHAN SERRIE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: As the U.S. grapples with a new spike in COVID-19 cases, this July 4th promises to be like no other. With many cities canceling or scaring back fireworks displays, authorities are trying to discourage amateurs from filling the vacuum. REIDY: I word to anyone who's thinking about a backyard firework show, don't. Fireworks are illegal in Massachusetts and dangerous in untrained hands. SERRIE: To discourage crowds in Florida, the Blue Angels announced they will not fly at the Pensacola Beach Air Show and Airbnb announced its banning parties in regions with public health mandates against large gatherings including the Sunshine State which set a new state record for new COVID cases on Thursday. BREN BREIT, SPOKESMAN, AIRBNB: What we and the Florida surgeon general really want -- you know, potential travelers to know is that we need to be prioritizing safe and responsible travel and that really means no parties. SERRIE: Public health officials are trying to discourage a repeat of large Memorial Day gatherings which they say contributed to a dramatic surge in COVID-19 cases that appeared in the following weeks. Even in the great outdoors, officials urged caution as larger than usual numbers are expected a popular natural attractions such as the American River in California. SGT. RANDY BICKEL, PARK RANGER, SACRAMENTO COUNTY: We're going to do our best to keep educating people. Please ask them to wear masks, ask them to social distance and try to respect to other people's space. SERRIE: In North Carolina which today reported its highest number of hospitalizations in new cases. Officials are framing mask wearing as more than just an issue of public health. DR. MANDY COHEN, SECRETARY, NORTH CAROLINA HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES: Wear a face covering because you want to reignite the economy and support businesses. Wear a face covering so our children can be back at school. (END VIDEOTAPE) SERRIE: And today Kansas and Texas began requiring people to wear face masks in public joining 20 states with similar mandates. But other states such as Georgia are hoping that voluntary appeals will be enough to encourage people to do the right thing, Mike. EMANUEL: Jonathan Serrie live in Atlanta. Jonathan, thanks a lot. For more on the coronavirus pandemic, joining me now is Fox News Contributor Dr. Janette Nesheiwat. Doctor, it's great to have you. DR. JANETTE NESHEIWAT, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Thank you. EMANUEL: We've seen some of the COVID-19 hot spots closed down, beaches and parks this Independence Day weekend, is that wise? NESHEIWAT: Well, yes, there's an area of an outbreak for example in Miami, certain parts of Arizona, certain parts of Texas because the concern is close people in high density crowd clusters, they can transmit the virus from one person to another. Now, the ocean or pools, they're safe, it's just that the condensed crowd is what -- is the concern for transmission of this virus. And you know, this Fourth of July holiday weekend has the potential for a perfect storm and with over 50,000 new cases daily and some hospitals maxing out their ICU capacity really need to take aggressive action and try to celebrate this holiday weekend at home so that we minimize person to person interaction with new people outside of your family. Really important of course in addition to that physical distancing. And if you are going to go out and celebrate, try to keep six to 10 feet and try to socialize outdoors and of course wear your masks. That's really important because the mask can help the transmission reduction from about 17 down to about three percent which can really save thousands of lives over the next few months. EMANUEL: As much of the country has reopened, there's been a real emphasis on those masks for Americans who have quarantined fatigue. How much of a difference does wearing a mask make when you're out and about? NESHEIWAT: Well, so, wearing a mask does not mean you should not practice physical distancing. The latest data that we have actually shows you're not only protecting others but you can actually be protecting yourself. And it also showed that by October, 33,000 lives would be saved. So it certainly helps, it's not 100 percent, that's why in addition to wearing your mask, physical distancing, hand hygiene, trying to avoid clusters crowds, areas with high density like bars and restaurants are really really important, especially because this virus potentially could be mutating to the point where it's three to nine times more transmissible, three to nine times more contagious. So that's really a big issue. So we have the tools and the knowledge and the power to fight and combat this virus, it's just a matter of compliance, being attentive and adhering to these CDC guidelines. EMANUEL: Doctor, in our final moments here, as you know young people think they're invincible. A final message to them heading into this Independence Day holiday weekend. NESHEIWAT: Be safe, be smart, we want to open up sooner than later. Remember, this virus can affect anyone from newborns, from children to senior citizens. And together we can all -- you know, protect one another and open up sooner than later. So really important to galvanize one another to do the right thing so that we could get back on our feet again. And remember, sometimes it's just safer to act as if we are all asymptomatic carriers and get back on our feet again. EMANUEL: And finally, is it smart to watch the fireworks from home? Perhaps look up in the sky or perhaps even on T.V.? NESHEIWAT: Yes, definitely a safer alternative because of your outdoors in close contact with one another, talking, shouting, screaming, you can transmit the virus, it can aerosolize and get into the nose, the mouth and the eyes of other people and definitely you can acquire the virus that way. So any opportunity we have to protect ourselves, to protect one another, we should certainly take that opportunity. EMANUEL: Dr. Janette Nesheiwat, wishing you a safe and healthy Independence Day weekend. Thanks for your time. NESHEIWAT: Thank you. Thank you, Mike, you too. EMANUEL: The Washington Redskins announced a thorough review of their name amid public pressure from major sponsors like Nike and FedEx. Correspondent David Spunt is following that story. Good evening, David. DAVID SPUNT, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Hi Mike, good evening to you. Even talk of a name change has been a long time coming when it comes to this team as you mentioned, the top draft with the Washington Redskins just conducting a review. No final decisions have been made at this point but the wheel started really moving yesterday when fed out -- FedEx, excuse me, put out an incredibly direct statement to all of the fans across the country and to the team management. I want to read it to you, it says, we have communicated to the team in Washington our request that they change the team name. Mike, that single sentence got Redskins owner Daniel Snyder's attention. FedEx owns the naming rights for the team's stadium. Now this request comes just a day after Adweek reported that 87 investment firms and shareholders sent a letter urging Nike, Pepsi, and FedEx to stop doing business with the team until that team name changes. Now, go to the Nike site if you want to try to buy something Redskins related, you can't. The company took all Redskins merchandise off the site until there is a name change. The name change isn't just important to people who are fans of the team last October when the Redskins played the Vikings' demonstrators in Minneapolis marched against the team name. Owner Dan Snyder released a statement this week quote, this process allows the team to take into account not only the proud tradition and history of the franchise but also input from our alumni, the organization, sponsors, the National Football League and the local community. It is proud to represent on and off the field. Quite a far cry Mike, from Snyder's comments to USA Today seven years ago where he said, quote, we'll never change the name. It's that simple. Never. You can use caps. The new head coach, Ron Rivera who was previously in Charlotte said, quote, this issue is of personal importance to me and I look forward to working closely with Dan Snyder to make sure we continue the mission of honoring and supporting our -- supporting Native Americans and our military. Now, online like a lot of people are talking about different names, suggesting different names to the team. One of those names you can expect not to see, the Braves, that's the original name for the team but NFL leader Roger Goodell said he is supportive if the team wants to change its name, Mike. EMANUEL: David Spunt reporting live. David, thanks a lot. In our Democracy 2020 report, former Vice President Joe Biden is expected to announce his own V.P. choice in early August. Biden has narrowed the list by saying it will be a woman. Correspondent Jacqui Heinrich looks at some of the candidates. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JACQUI HEINRICH, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Conventional wisdom among people who study gender and politics says former Vice President Joe Biden will likely pick a woman of color as his running mate, most likely a black woman. The country's demanding diversity at the table but also that move may motivate a key voting black, black woman who voted at the highest rates of any racial and gender group in the 2008 and 2012 elections. LORI COX HAN, PROFESSOR OF POLITICAL SCIENCE, CHAPMAN UNIVERSITY: Normally running mates, we don't help that much. I mean, there's no real political science data that says that they do, but then 2020 is a whole different ball game. HEINRICH: Experts consider Senator Kamala Harris the top pick vetted on a national stage. In her own presidential campaign, she brings legislative and law enforcement experience despite progressive criticism of her record as attorney general. (INAUDIBLE) Florida Congresswoman Val Demings, a former police chief from a swing state also drew national attention during the Black Lives Matter protest and in her roles in impeachment manager. Other picks like Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms and Stacey Abrams, lack federal experience but California Congresswoman Karen Bass has it, past praise of Fidel Castro could hurt her with Florida voters. And Susan Rice, Obama's former national security advisor would add to Biden's foreign policy know-how. Biden has not committed to choosing a black woman but experts say the choice will reflect the future of the party. There's a chance Progressives get left behind. Senator Elizabeth Warren's in the running, but she's white and older. KELLY DITTMAR, RUTGERS UNIVERSITY: I don't think she would lose a lot of voters but I think there would be also a level of disappointment and concern about, OK, where Joe Biden are you going to make sure our voices are at this table? HEINRICH: With other woman of color offering perspective and experience like Senator Tammy Duckworth an Asian-American combat veteran, experts think it's unlikely white woman on the short list will make the cut. (END VIDEOTAPE) HEINRICH: Experts believe the main driver in Biden's choice is unifying the Democratic Party, Mike. EMANUEL: Jacqui Heinrich in New York. Jackie, thanks a lot. Ghislaine Maxwell is behind bars in charge with helping Jeffrey Epstein sexually exploit and abuse multiple minor girls. One woman says when she was 14 years old, Maxwell recruited and raped her. The victim who has asked remain anonymous spoke with Fox News. Correspondent Bryan Llenas has this report that you may find disturbing. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: She is just as evil as Jeffrey Epstein. BRYAN LLENAS, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: For the first time, a woman who wishes to conceal her identity is speaking publicly alleging Ghislaine Maxwell begins sexually abusing her in 1991 when she was just 14 years old. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: She did rape me. I would say it's more than 20 or 30 times. She is a rapist. Destroyed my what was supposed to be the best years of my life being a teenager, being a cheerleader. LLENAS: She claims Maxwell would abuse her with Epstein and sometimes alone coaching her, have her to have sex with men. The abuse stopped when she was 16, after became pregnant with Epstein's baby, and had to have an abortion. Her attacker grew fearful she would tell her grandparents or the authorities, but for good measure, she says she was gang-raped one last time as punishment. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Ghislaine was a part of it and Jeffrey Epstein's a part of it, and I was drugged. Gang-raped and left on the lawn and they put a gun to me. And the man that drove me home said I would never be (INAUDIBLE), I never come back alive if I spoke about it. LLENAS: Jane Doe's legal team is researching whether she can pursue criminal charges, but she is willing to serve as a witness against Maxwell in her upcoming trial. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Absolutely, I would definitely take a stand and testify. JORDAN MERSON, ATTORNEY FOR MAXWELL'S ALLEGED VICTIM: People felt, you know, cheated when Mr. Epstein committed suicide in prison and they didn't get a chance to sit in the courtroom and see the judicial system play out. And they're hoping that there's a different result here. (END VIDEOTAPE) LLENAS: According to her attorney, Jane Doe's grandparents have corroborated her claims. When asked about these specific allegations, an attorney for Ghislaine Maxwell, said, \"no comment.\" Mike? EMANUEL: Bryan Llenas, thanks very much. Up next, to look back at lessons learned from racial tensions in the 1960s, and why they were rejected by the Democratic president. First, here is what some of our Fox affiliates around the country are covering tonight. FOX 10 in Phoenix, where police say a man robbing a gas station convenience store fatally shot a bystander. The robber turned shooter, then was killed in a Wild West shootout with another bystander who was injured in the exchange of gunfire. None of those involved was immediately identified. FOX 29 in Philadelphia, reporting on Major League Baseball announcing they've had 38 positive COVID-19 tests as training resumes. 31 players and seven staff are infected, spread across 19 teams. Opening day has been rescheduled for July 23rd. And this is a live look at Denver from Fox 31. One of the big stories there tonight, Colorado joins New Jersey and New Hampshire in allowing legal betting on Nathan's Famous Hot Dog Eating Contest for the first time in the event's history. The July 4th tradition will take place at an undisclosed private location with social distancing measures in place rather than Coney Island, New York. That's tonight's live look \"OUTSIDE THE BELTWAY\" from SPECIAL REPORT. We'll be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) EMANUEL: In the mid to late 1960s, riders rampaged through many American cities. At that time, the Kerner Commission comprised of blacks and whites, Liberals and Conservatives was established to look into the unrest. The group's conclusions were roundly rejected by the country's Democratic president. Since then, history has repeated itself time and again. Correspondent Douglas Kennedy, reports on the Commission's predictions and talks to its last surviving member. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DOUGLAS KENNEDY, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: This is all really familiar. JOHN KOSKINEN, FORMER COMMISSIONER, INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE: Yes, this is a scene that, unfortunately, has been repeated many times in the past. KENNEDY: Detroit 1967, Los Angeles 1992, Ferguson 2014, everywhere 2020. For some, it's the same thing all over again. John Koskinen doesn't want to say I told you so. But back in 1968, he worked for a commission that predicted it all. So, the Kerner Commission was actually the first time the U.S. government identified racial inequality and institutionalized racism as the root cause of urban social unrest. KOSKINEN: That's right and that's why it was so controversial at the time. KENNEDY: It's most famous passage warned, \"Our nation is moving toward two societies, one black, one white, separate and unequal.\" They were conclusions that irritated then-President Lyndon Johnson, who wanted the commission to conclude that outside groups were the problem, organizing protests for nefarious political purpose. FRED HARRIS, FORMER SENATOR OF OKLAHOMA: President Johnson himself, unfortunately, believed that there was some conspiracy behind these riots or disorders. He thought that they were organized. And we found that, that was simply not true. KENNEDY: Former Oklahoma senator, Fred Harris is the last surviving member of the actual commission. HARRIS: Now, that police have become more and more militarized, more and more separated from the community where they're supposed to protect and serve. KENNEDY: The Kerner Commission concluded that racism was everyone's problem and that racial inequality would never be solved unless everyone came together to solve it. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: No justice! UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No peace! UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: No peace! KENNEDY: It's a sentiment, Koskinen, says is apparent as much today as it was back then. But today's protests are actually giving you a little bit of hope. KOSKINEN: Well, yes. Because I think what people have been able to see is visible representations of the difficulties African Americans have in a day to day basis in their relationship with the white superstructure but certainly with the police. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: What I want? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: (INAUDIBLE) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (INAUDIBLE) KENNEDY: Both he and Harris say we have a chance now to finally address these generation's old problems. And they say we better take advantage of it. Just outside Lafayette Square in Washington, D.C., Douglas Kennedy, Fox News. (END VIDEOTAPE) EMANUEL: Up next, we hear from some World War II veterans ahead of the Independence Day weekend. First, \"BEYOND OUR BORDERS\" tonight. At least four people are dead and nearly 100 injured after an explosion at a fireworks factory in northwestern Turkey. At least three people are unaccounted for, efforts to control the fire were hampered by continuing explosions. The cause is unknown at this point. Botswana is launching an investigation after 275 elephant carcasses have been found in recent weeks. Poaching which is a problem and the country has been ruled out as the cause. Wildlife officials are using aircraft to better understand the mysterious loss of life. COVID-19 is considered an unlikely candidate, but for now, nothing including poison has been ruled out. The USS Dwight D. Eisenhower has now spent 169 straight days at sea, a record for an American warship. The nuclear-powered aircraft carrier is currently in the Arabian Sea. Just some of the other stories \"BEYOND OUR BORDERS\" tonight. We'll be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) EMANUEL: The Fourth of July marks one moment of independence for America, but the fight for freedom did not end in the 1700s. Through many wars, political debates, and centuries, the fight is continued. With assistance from National Geographic, my colleague Brett Baier, looks back at the greatest generation who helped win World War II, 75 years ago. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BRET BAIER, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: They are among the last surviving voices of the Second World War. HARRY STEWART, VETERAN, WORLD WAR II: I never thought that I'd have the chance to actually train and become a pilot. But World War II came along. VICTOR GREGG, VETERAN, WORLD WAR II: Every word I'm going to tell you, there's no make-believe or anything. And whether you acknowledge it or not, it's going to be the truth. BAIER: The stories of these two veterans and others are chronicled in National Geographic's coverage of the 75th anniversary of the end of World War II, in their June 2020 issue. That quarter-century milestone is being celebrated across the globe. From a military parade in Moscow's Red Square to celebrate the victory over Nazi Germany to multiple commemorations this year at D.C.'s memorial to the war on the National Mall. The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs estimates that about 300,000 American World War II veterans are still alive, yet with that number declining every year, capturing their stories is more critical than ever. Harry Stewart served with the Tuskegee Airman. Just 10 of the famed Tuskegee Airman remain today. STEWART: I just felt as though I was meant to be in an airplane. I got so if felt as though the aircraft was an extension of my body. I felt as though my arms were the wings. BAIER: He says he wants the Tuskegee Airmen to be remembered as good citizens who helped protect their country during a time of need, even in the face of discrimination. STEWART: It was quite a thing because people wondered, well, these guys had been segregated all the time. And how do they fly? Are they good pilots? The answer is, yes. BAIER: After postwar budget cuts forced Stewart out of the Air Force, he was denied a position as a commercial pilot with Pan American and Transworld Airlines because of his race. STEWART: When I got out of the service, I applied with a couple of airlines as a pilot, and I was denied being accepted because of my color. So I went back to school, and I got my degree in mechanical engineering. As the years passed, I would go to the airport there, and I'd look in the cockpit, and lo and behold there's an African-Americans sitting behind the controls there ready to fly the aircraft. And the one that truly brought tears to my face was when not one, but there were two African-Americans sitting in the cockpit theare. They were both women. So, that was quite a thing. BAIER: For Victor Gregg, an offer of a hot of tea lured him to a recruiting office in London where he signed up for the British Army on his 18th birthday. Serving as a rifleman, his name was pulled out of a hat to join a parachute brigade. He says they received their training for that task while on the job. VICTOR GREGG, WORLD WAR II VETERAN: Consequently, when we jumped, we lost more people on the descent in the first hour that we lost through the six days of the fight. Out of the 460 who jumped, there's only about 180, I think. All the rest were dead. And they was jumping on the dead bodies of the blokes who had jumped the day before. BAIER: Both men say they served out of a sense of duty to their countries. GREGG: My attitude of the war was that's what we're supposed to do. If the Colonel told us to do anything, we done it. If he says we're here to stay, that's it. We made the best of it. STEWART: I'm a strong patriot. I feel this is nothing like the Constitution that we have of the United States, which is the most beautiful document anybody could ever read. The practice of it is not perfect, it's not perfect today, it may not be perfect tomorrow, but it keeps getting closer and closer and closer right on out to infinity. BAIER: In Washington, Bret Baier, FOX News. (END VIDEOTAPE) MIKE EMANUEL, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: President Trump pushes ahead with July 4th festivities despite spiking virus numbers and a warning from health officials. The panel is next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, (R) PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We're going to Mount Rushmore, Mount Rushmore is in great shape, and it's going to be in great shape for centuries to come. We are looking forward to it. I'll be making a speech there. I'll be seeing a lot of people, a lot of different people. If you look at what's going on, if you look at the numbers all over, I think we're going to have a very strong V-shape. DR. JEROME ADAMS, U.S. SURGEON GENERAL: Every single person has to make up their own mind. There are going to be people going to beaches, going to barbecues, going to different environments, and they have to look at their individual risk. As you mentioned, CDC says larger gatherings are a higher risk. The most important thing I would say to people as if you do go out to a gathering or in public, please weare a face covering. (END VIDEO CLIP) EMANUEL: President Trump making his way to Mount Rushmore. We can give you a live look there courtesy of the White House of the scene, folks waiting for the arrival of Air Force One, and President Trump and senior administration officials are telling us the president is going to talk about on the anniversary of America's founding, he will tell the truth about America's histories and tell the truth about those trying to tear it down and divide our country. Key points the president is expected to make, America is a great and virtuous country. If we tear down our history we will not be able to understand ourselves or America's destiny. And they add he will say the leftwing mob and those practicing cancel culture are engaging in totalitarian behavior that is completely alien to American life, and we must not accept it. With that, let's bring in our panel, Byron York, chief political correspondent for the \"Washington Examiner,\" Julie Pace is the Washington Bureau Chief for the Associated Press, and \"Washington Post\" columnist Marc Thiessen. Panel, welcome. Byron, your thoughts and the themes the president is going to strike tonight. BRYON YORK, CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, \"WASHINGTON EXAMINER\": Well, one of the themes he's apparently going to talk about essentially is law and order in this time of unrest. And he's been inconsistent in the way he has dealt with that disorder across the country and really needs to develop a consistent position. How many people have watched as crowds tried to tear down or tore down a statue in a number of cities across the country, and their first thought was, where at the police? And the president himself almost allowed a mob to take down the statue of Andrew Jackson in Lafayette Park right in front of the White House. The president actually needs to get a stronger, more consistent position on that, and make clear where he stands on all of this. EMANUEL: Julie, we are four months to the day from Election Day. Obviously, President Trump misses the opportunity to get out and speak to his crowds. He's going to Mount Rushmore tonight. Your thoughts? JULIE PACE, WASHINGTON BUREAU CHIEF, ASSOCIATED PRESS: In talking to a lot of Republicans this week, there was a hope that the president four months from Election Day would be trying to reach out to some of those disaffected Republicans, some of those independents who don't necessarily see the president reflecting their views, their concerns about the public health crisis, about the economy. And instead, I think what we're going to see tonight is a president who is really meaning into the message that his base wants to hear. He sees this election as one where he can win if his base turns out in really large numbers, and I think he is signaling to those, again, Republicans who I've talked to this week who would like to see him just ever so slightly reach out to those independents that this is, again, going to be a campaign that is really targeted toward that base. EMANUEL: We have the luxury of having a former White House speech writer on the panel tonight, so Marc, your thoughts on the themes going into tonight's big event? MARC THIESSEN, AMERICAN ENTERPRISE INSTITUTE: If I was advising the president, what I would tell him to do is quote Dr. Martin Luther King. Dr. Martin Luther King actually rejected the principles of the 1619 project and the idea that America's founding was inherently racist. And I would encourage him and, quite frankly, anyone today over the a Fourth of July weekend to go back and read the \"I have a Dream\" speech, because Martin Luther King embraced the principles of the American founding. He said that we need to live up to those principles. I want to give you a section of it. He said, \"In a sense, we have come to our nation's capital to cash a check. When the architects of our republic wrote the magnificent words of the Constitution and the Declaration, they were signing a promissory note to which every American was to fall heir. That note was a promise to all men, yes, black men as well as white men would be guaranteed unalienable rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. And we've come to cash that check.\" This is the opposite message of the Black Lives Matter movement. What Martin Luther King was saying was not that just racism was unfair, racism is un-American. The Black Lives Matter movement is saying that the opposite of it, that basically racism is as American as apple pie, that it's baked into our system, and that is a message that Martin Luther King absolutely rejected. EMANUEL: A big difference form last Fourth of July to this year when we had massive crowds on the National Mall in the rain to hear the president speak, as of course, COVID-19. Here is Dr. Anthony Fauci sounding the alarm. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES: \u00a0I think the data is showing that there is a single mutation that actually makes the virus be able to replicate better and maybe have high viral loads. It just seems that the virus replicates better and may be more transmissible. But this is still at the stage of trying to confirm that. But some very good viral geneticists are working on that right now. (END VIDEO CLIP) EMANUEL: Four months out from Election Day, Byron, what are the COVID-19 concerns? YORK: They're real, and they're growing, although there's a different characteristic to this wave of the disease in the sense that there are better treatments for it, no doubt about that. Politically, part of the big problem of the president's rally in Tulsa was that he held a large gathering indoors. And that is really the highest risk of transmission. The think about the Mount Rushmore event is that perhaps there won't be a lot of social distancing, perhaps not everybody will wear a mask, but it will be outdoors, which is a much better idea. And the president took a lot of criticism for that, holding the rally indoors in Tulsa. Now, it would be perhaps comparable to a lot of the protests that we've seen across the country, most of which were also outdoors. EMANUEL: Julie, from the White House video, it looks like a great crowd there at Mount Rushmore. Your thoughts heading into the event tonight with the COVID-19 concerns? PACE: I think one of the challenges for the president right now is he so clearly wants to move past the pandemic. He really wants to focus on the economy. He wants this to be behind us, but it's not. And so he has this challenge as he addresses that crowd, as he talks to the nation over the next several months is to not look as though he is ignoring what is happening in a lot states. A lot of the states that we are talking about right now where we do see cases on the rise are battleground states, states where the president has to win if he wants a second term. And I do think that he has a lot of advisors around him who want him to address what's happening there. EMANUEL: Next up, the Friday Lightning Round, the debate over renaming the Washington Redskins, vice presidential Candidate Casino, and this week's Winners and Losers. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: In the same way Redskins has evolved, and despite its history, it is now considered a slut. It's nothing to do with the sensitivities of a mass of people. It has to do with a decent, simple, elementary respect. You don't use that word if you can avoid it. (END VIDEO CLIP) EMANUEL: That was the late great Charles Krauthammer opining on the Redskins name change. Nearly seven years later the debate continues, and we're back with our panel, Byron, Julie, and Marc. Byron, so Daniel Snyder has gone from heck no, never, ever, to some major sponsors saying we are pulling our money, so now it's a maybe? YORK: Listen, it's going to happen. The idea of holding and making a study of this change is just a prelude to actually doing it. And the difference between now and what happened in the past is a change in corporate America. Not only is the NFL a giant business that is opposed to the name, by FedEx, the company which purchased the naming rights to the Redskins stadium now has made it very clear it wants the name changed. It would lose other sponsorships as well, so this is going to happen. EMANUEL: Julie, your thoughts? PACE: This isn't just public sentiment changing. There's been a lot of pressure on the Redskins for a lot of years to take this step. I think a lot of this is about money. When you start to lose sponsors, including the naming sponsor of your stadium, when they start to say we are not comfortable with this name, the ownership really, I don't think, has any choice moving forward. EMANUEL: And Marc, it sounds like a new name could be new merchandise and old gear could be retro, and so probably a lot of money to be made if you change, right? THIESSEN: Yes, well, this is being done for the woke mob, not for the Native-Americans. The \"Washington Post\" had a poll in 2016, 90 percent of Native-Americans are not offended by the Redskins name, 80 percent wouldn't be offended if you came up and called them a redskin to their face even if you were not a Native-American. So this is not being done for the Native- American. It's being done for the mob that is tearing down the statues and terrorizing the entire country. And you know what, they're coming after the Chicago Blackhawks and they're coming after the Atlanta Braves and they're coming after the Kansas City Chiefs next. So this is only the beginning. EMANUEL: Sorry, I got a little excited about Candidate Casino. Let's go there. All right, the Joe Biden Veep-stakes. Byron where is your money going? YORK: Look, I think the big question is whether the Democratic base will be happy with all-white ticket. My guess is they will not, so I'm still high on Kamala Harris with $40. If they're OK with that, Elizabeth Warren next with $20. Val Demings and Keisha Lance Bottoms with $15, and Tammy Duckworth, a possibility at $10. EMANUEL: Julie, where's your money going? PACE: I'm with Byron that I think there's a lot of focus on some of the African-American women who are in contention. I've got $40 on Kamala Harris who seems to be leading the pack right now, $20 on Val Demings, and $20 on Keisha Lance Bottoms, the mayor of Atlanta, $20 on Elizabeth Warren, though, still really hanging on and a favorite of a lot of liberals in the Democratic Party. EMANUEL: And Marc? THIESSEN: So I'm also agreeing with everybody it's probably going to be an African-American woman. I put 50 on the person who I think it should be, which is Val Demings because Joe Biden needs to reach both the base and the swing voters and get them both excited. Val Demings was an impeachment manager, she's an African-American, she's popular with the police, but she's also a former police chief, and that would strengthen Joe Biden's message that he's a moderate who is not for dismantling the police. I also put down $20 on Kamala Harris, $20 on Susan Rice, and $10 on Keisha Lance Bottoms. EMANUEL: All right, if it's Friday, that means it's time for Winners and Losers. Byron, you go. YORK: Winner is Janis Shinwari who for eight years was a translator for American troops in Afghanistan, credited with saving at least five American lives, all while being targeted by the Taliban, became a U.S. citizen this week, a very happy even for everyone involved. The loser is Ghislaine Maxwell, Jeffrey Epstein's girlfriend, procurer, close associate for years. Now she's been arrested, and we might finally learn more about what Epstein did with some of his very rich and very powerful friends. EMANUEL: Let's go to Julie, winners and losers? PACE: So my winner this week is the Biden campaign. All the polls are moving in the direction, big fundraising week. Of course, you don't want to be the winner in July. You want to be the winner in November, so a lot of time to go in that race. My loser, fireworks. I love fireworks. Cancelled across so much of the country this holiday weekend. EMANUEL: Marc, take it away. THIESSEN: My winner is the U.S. economy, creating 4.8 million jobs in the last month. That's 20 times -- that's not only a record. That's 20 times the normal rate in an expansion. We're going to have 20 to 30 percent economic growth. Donald Trump is going to be riding a big economic wave into the reelection campaign. And my loser Joe Biden because he was downplaying the good economic news. America has been through so much. We've been through race riots, we've been through a pandemic, we've been through the worst economy since the Great Depression, and we get some good news, and Joe Biden says don't celebrate. Give me a break. EMANUEL: All right, panel, thanks very much, an action-packed week. When we come back, this week's \"Notable Quotables.\" (COMMERCIAL BREAK) EMANUEL: Finally tonight, it is Friday, so that means this week's \"Notable Quotables.\" (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, (R) PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: If you don't have confidence, you're not going to do very well. MAYOR BILL DE BLASIO, (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: The vast majority of New Yorkers want safety, and they want respect from NYPD officers. They don't want to see any bias, and we're going to strike that balance, and I think this budget helps us do it. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Let's mark the date on the calendar and how long it's going to be before we'll have that conversation about New Yorkers crying out for more police. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Today we announced the arrest of one of the villains in this investigation. She had slithered away to a gorgeous property in New Hampshire. DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES: \u00a0The numbers speak for themselves. I'n very concerned and I'm not satisfied which what's going because we are going on the wrong direction. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: People need to treat this like a hurricane, a hurricane is coming to my community. TRUMP: I had asked a mask on, I sort of liked the way I looked. I looked like the Lone Ranger. JOE BIDEN, (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I can hardly wait to compare my cognitive capability to the cognitive capability of the man I'm running against. KAYLEIGH MCENANY, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: This president, I'll tell you, is the most informed person on planet earth when it comes to the threats that we face. MIKE POMPEO, SECRETARY OF STATE: There are many folks using the Taliban or who have used the Taliban over years and years and years as proxy forces. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Right? It don't smell right. TRUMP: Nobody is going to shatter the American dream. God bless America. (END VIDEO CLIP) EMANUEL: Amen. Another wild week in the world of news, and it's not over yet. President Trump will speak tonight from Mount Rushmore and 10:00 p.m. eastern time. We will of course have complete live coverage. Following that I will be back for \"FOX News at Night.\" Tomorrow, starting at 6:00 p.m. eastern right here on FOX News we will bring you President Trump's \"Salute to American\" celebration. And be sure to join me this Sunday when I sit in for Chris Wallace on \"FOX News Sunday.\" Among our guests, Labor Secretary Eugene Scalia.

Only 17 percent of respondents in a recent  said they felt pride when they thought of the state of the country today. Seventy-one percent said they were angry, and 66 percent said they were afraid.\nWhat a horrible bramble of outraged anxiety. What a mess.Despairing about the future of the country is very much the thing these days. From the progressive left and the nationalist right, we hear more and more that the American system is too corrupt, too broken and too unresponsive to address the concerns of today. Even among normal people there is the strong expression that something has gone terribly wrong.Even if they would have wanted the colonies to break free, we get an increasing sense from our fellow Americans that given all of the failings of our nation and weaknesses of our system that it just hasn\u2019t been worth it.Like an Ikea bookcase with one permanently droopy shelf taunting you from the wall, America just hasn\u2019t been worth all the trouble we\u2019ve put in it. You can see the particleboard where you cracked the fa\u00e7ade with that stupid little Allen wrench. Maybe we should chuck the thing.\nMaybe we\u2019d be like Canada or Australia, our contented-seeming cousins who keep Queen  on their cash and still hum a bit of \u201cRule Britannia\u201d under their collective breaths. They don\u2019t have mass protests in the streets, people threatening each other with murder over wearing corona masks or a political climate as noxious as sulfuric acid. They have their troubles, but not like us.But we know that wouldn\u2019t have been possible for us. Had Britain, not the U.S., been the dominant power in North America for the past two centuries \u2013 presuming it could have done so \u2013 things would look very different here and there. How the continent would have been carved up, colonized and governed would have been so different, and world history right along with it.\nWe wouldn\u2019t be like Canada. Canada wouldn\u2019t even be Canada. The French \u2013 whatever they would be (if they even were) in a world without American independence \u2013 might even be holding out in some of their claims in the interior of the continent.\nAnd, of course, without the United States, it\u2019s not likely that we would have seen the amazing technological improvements that followed in the 19th and 20th centuries. Britain is good at governance but has a pretty lousy track record on innovation in the past 150 years. There might still have been a , but good luck getting a patent.\nAmerican independence was such a catalytic event in world history that we really can\u2019t imagine what things would be like. America is the  of the modern world. If you take it out, everything else changes.\n\u201cOkay,\u201d you might say, \u201cso what?\u201d America is, depending on your preferred set of antipathies, racist/sexist/socialist/lazy/unfair/weak/militaristic/cruel/coddled\u2026 and so on. The world would be different without America, yes, but is the status quo something worth perpetuating?\nHere you should ask yourself a couple of other questions. In what other large, developed nation would you prefer to live? You can skip the part where you imagine life on a Caribbean Island or slicing steaks on the Pampas.\nThere are six other countries in the world that had gross domestic product of $2 trillion or more in 2019: China, Japan, Germany, India, Britain and France. How are they doing on the perceived defects of America today? How\u2019s racism and sectarianism in Europe? How\u2019s inequality in India? How\u2019s sexism in Japan? How\u2019s life in China\u2019s police state?\nYou might prefer one of those nations other than China for cultural or lifestyle reasons, but not on any reasonable grounds are they not afflicted by the same woes of which America stands accused.In fact, without America, those countries, if they existed in any familiar forms in the year 2020 without America\u2019s help and protection, would probably be far less fair and far less egalitarian.\nAfter all, they got to be the way they were in substantial part by copying us. Our nation was for so long the envy of the world and our accomplishments so fulgent that the system derived by the men who declared independence \u2013 Mr. Madison\u2019s republic \u2013 became the preferred operating system for the world. A democratic republic with explicit protections of individual rights has been the open-source software that changed everything.Would it have inevitably just evolved? Would the world have eventually bumped into liberal democracy someplace else? Would the idea of natural, inalienable rights have worked itself out somehow without America?We wouldn\u2019t bet on it \u2013 certainly not enough to flirt with the possibility of a world without our nation. From the start and still today, America is indispensable.[]\u201cThis convention composed of men who possessed the confidence of the people, and many of whom had become highly distinguished by their patriotism, virtue and wisdom, in times which tried the minds and hearts of men, undertook the arduous task. In the mild season of peace, with minds unoccupied by other subjects, they passed many months in cool, uninterrupted, and daily consultation; and finally, without having been awed by power, or influenced by any passions except love for their country, they presented and recommended to the people the plan produced by their joint and very unanimous councils.\u201d \u2013 In honor of President \u2019s Fourth of July birthday, here is an excerpt from his  on the 150th Anniversary of the Declaration of Independence, July 5, 1926: \u201cIt was not because it was proposed to establish a new nation, but because it was proposed to establish a nation on new principles, that July 4, 1776, has come to be regarded as one of the greatest days in history. Great ideas do not burst upon the world unannounced. They are reached by a gradual development over a length of time usually proportionate to their importance. This is especially true of the principles laid down in the Declaration of Independence. Three very definite propositions were set out in its preamble regarding the nature of mankind and therefore of government. These were the doctrine that all men are created equal, that they are endowed with certain inalienable rights, and that therefore the source of the just powers of government must be derived from the consent of the governed.\u201d Email us at  with your tips, comments or questions.NATIONAL HEAD-TO-HEAD AVERAGE40.8 percent50.6 percentBiden by 9.8 pointsBiden \u2191 0.4 points; Trump \u2191 2 points[.]BATTLEGROUND POWER RANKINGS(270 electoral votes needed to win)(109 electoral votes): Wisconsin (10), Ohio (18), Florida (29), Arizona (11), Pennsylvania (20), North Carolina (15), Iowa (6)(180 electoral votes)(249 electoral votes)[.]TRUMP JOB PERFORMANCE 40 percent 55.4 percent -15.4 points\u2193 1.6 points[.]This week,  and  look ahead to Independence Day and touch base on their latest culinary feats after a long food-talk hiatus.

It was the second month of gains after a loss of more than 20 million in April, when the pandemic put a large swath of economic activity on ice. The unemployment rate fell to 11.1 percent, down from a peak of 14.7 percent in April but still higher than in any previous period since World War II. The rate would have been about one percentage point higher had it not been for persistent data-collection problems, the Labor Department said. There were still nearly 15 million fewer jobs in June than in February, before the pandemic forced businesses to close. And the survey was compiled in mid-June, before coronavirus cases began to spike in Arizona, Florida and several other states. More timely data, also released by the Labor Department on Thursday morning, showed that 1.4 million Americans filed new claims for state unemployment benefits last week, and more than 800,000 filed for benefits under the federal Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program.\u201d: \u201cPresident touted the record job gains in June Thursday, saying the U.S. was \u2018roaring back\u2019 as the economy attempts to crawl out of a crater left by the coronavirus pandemic. \u2026 \u2018Today\u2019s announcement proves that our economy is roaring back,\u2019 Trump said, adding that the government\u2019s response to the pandemic was \u2018working out very well.\u2019 The monthly job gains in May and June are historic, but the labor market is still facing a net loss of 14.7 million job losses from the coronavirus recession. About 2.7 million jobs were added in May and 4.8 million positions were added in June -- both a record. However, they came after an unprecedented 22 million job losses in March and April. Economists and analysts anticipate that the job figures will be volatile until a vaccine for the virus is developed.\u201d: \u201cPresident Trump and Democratic challenger  both set eye-popping fundraising records last month \u2014 but Biden\u2019s records were larger. The former vice president\u2019s campaign announced on Wednesday night that they, the Democratic National Committee and their joint fundraising committees hauled in a combined $141 million in June, which was by far the campaign\u2019s best monthly figure to date. Biden\u2019s campaign called it a \u2018jaw-dropping sum of money.\u2019 The presumptive Democratic presidential nominee\u2019s campaign also reported bringing in a combined $282 million with the DNC during the April-June second quarter of fundraising, which was another record. And officials touted that the DNC outraised their rivals for a second straight month. The announcement from Biden\u2019s team came just a couple of hours after the president\u2019s reelection campaign reported that they, the Republican National Committee and their joint fundraising ventures brought in a combined $131 million in June \u2014 and more than $266 million the past three months.\u201d: \u201cDonald Trump wasn\u2019t halfway through his speech in Tulsa, Okla., and Democratic ad makers in Washington and New York were already cutting footage for an air raid on the slumping president. \u2026[The] ads zeroed in on Trump\u2019s admission that he urged officials to \u2018slow the [coronavirus] testing down.\u2019 It\u2019s a reflection of a growing consensus among Democrats about what kind of hits on Trump are most likely to persuade swing voters \u2014 and which ones won\u2019t. As in 2016, ad makers are focusing on Trump\u2019s character. But unlike four years ago, they are no longer focusing on his character in isolation \u2014 rather they are pouring tens of millions of dollars into ads yoking his behavior to substantive policy issues surrounding the coronavirus, the economy and the civil unrest since the death of .\u201d: \u201cFormer Vice President Joe Biden continues to lead President Donald Trump by a wide margin nationally, a poll released Thursday shows, as the race for the White House stabilizes, at least for the time being, with Biden well in front. The Monmouth University poll shows Biden with a 12-point nationwide lead over the president, 53 percent to 41 percent among registered voters. \u2026 Thursday\u2019s survey highlighted one of Trump\u2019s major obstacles to reelection \u2014 the amount of the electorate which has made up its mind against him. Half of registered voters say they are not at all likely to support Trump, while 39 percent say the same for Biden. Whereas Trump benefited from a relatively unpopular opponent in 2016 when running against , Biden\u2019s favorability ratings this cycle present a different challenge. Forty-four percent of voters view the former vice president favorably, the same percentage that view him unfavorably. Trump\u2019s favorability rating, by comparison, is 17 points underwater.\u201d: \u201cJoe Biden is leading President Donald Trump by a 46 to 41 percent margin among registered and likely voters, according to a new poll by Susquehanna Polling and Research in partnership with FOX43. The poll, released Sunday, is similar to an April poll which showed the former Vice President with a 48-42 lead over Mr. Trump. The survey polled 715 voters statewide, 49 percent of which were registered Democrats, and 42 percent were Republican. However, of those polled, nearly a quarter identified their voting habits were more closely aligned with being an Independent.\u201d: \u201cThe country's top intelligence officials on Thursday held a classified briefing with congressional leaders amid demands for more information on the reports that Russian agents offered Taliban-linked militants in Afghanistan thousands of dollars in bounties for killing American troops. Top intelligence officials, including CIA chief Director  and Director of National Intelligence , held the briefing Thursday afternoon with members of the so-called \u2018Gang of Eight\u2019: Senate Majority Leader , R-Ky., House Speaker , D-Calif., and the top Republicans and Democrats on the two intelligence committees. \u2018Force protection is a primary purpose of intelligence. It should have the same importance to the Commander-in-Chief.\u00a0 Any reports of threats on our troops must be pursued relentlessly,\u2019 Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader , D-N.Y., said in a statement following the meeting. \u2026 Trump also has not directly addressed the substance of the reports nor whether the U.S. has or will respond to Russia.\u201dThis week Fox News Senior Judicial Analyst Judge explains how the Declaration\u2019s essence is that all persons have equal natural rights: \u201cThe Declaration\u2019s essence is that all persons have equal natural rights that no government can take away by legislation or command. Those rights can be used freely to pursue and defend life, liberty and happiness. Those rights can also be used to consent or not to consent to a government. \u2026 The government would not come about, of course, until the bloody war was completed. In reality, the real revolution was completed by July 4, 1776 because it was a revolution of minds more than of government. \u2026 Ah, but the revolution of men\u2019s minds -- the idea that the government was not legitimate unless consented to and limited, that individual personal freedom, not government power, is the default position; all of this was stirred up by the radicals, articulated by Jefferson, embraced by Congress, achieved by blood and acquiesced by the king -- was as much a change for our forbearers as was the violence against the British.\u201d More . - -  -  - \u201cThe optimist in me would say the odds of us getting a break in the future are greater because we\u2019ve had such a run of bad luck.\u201d \u2013  Email us at  and please make sure to include your name and hometown.: \u201cA highway in Virginia was backed up for nearly an hour Wednesday after motorists found themselves sharing the road with loose pigs wandering into traffic, video shows.

But in the end, all lost and none made it to the\u00a0Oval Office.Keep this\u00a0in mind when you read and watch\u00a0all the\u00a0news stories\u00a0now predicting that  is headed for defeat when he faces former Vice President  in the November presidential election.Polls are snapshots in time and far from infallible. They can vary wildly depending on who is polled, how questions are phrased and many other variables. All this is not a matter of opinion. It\u2019s an indisputable fact.As just one of many examples of how wrong polls often can be,\u00a032 years ago this week The New York Times\u00a0published\u00a0a story with the\u202fheadline\u202f\u201cDukakis Lead Widens, According to New Poll.\u201d The Times reported that\u00a0Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, then the Democratic presidential nominee, was ahead of then-Vice President George H.W. Bush by an eye-popping margin of 55 percent to 38 percent in the 1988 race for president.I could fill a book with polling results that turned out to be just as\u00a0inaccurate.In the wake of\u00a0all the\u00a0polling failures\u00a0cited above and more,\u00a0all\u00a0public\u00a0election\u00a0polls\u00a0should have an asterisk next to the results\u00a0and say\u00a0\u201ccould be wrong.\u201dIt\u2019s worth noting that a recent\u202fpoll\u202ffound that 62 percent of those surveyed are afraid to share their political views in the current environment.\u202fIn the age of President Trump, getting accurate data is becoming\u00a0almost\u00a0impossible.\u00a0After all, if you vote for Trump, tell a pollster you\u2019re voting for Trump or show support for the president on social media, you might be attacked as a racist or perhaps even fired from your job, as a\u00a0teacher in\u00a0Michigan\u00a0alleged recently.In the current toxic political situation caused by the left\u2019s unhinged reaction to the election of the ultimate political outsider Donald Trump, it\u2019s quite obvious that if someone was afraid to tell a pollster about their intention to vote for Trump for fear of retribution in 2016, that fear has grown exponentially over the past four years.Similar to the 2016 Brexit vote, polling in the 2016 Trump-Clinton race didn\u2019t capture the under-vote that showed up in force on Election Day.\u202fThis is an election year unlike any we\u2019ve ever witnessed.\u00a0America is in the midst of a pandemic that has caused massive economic hardships.\u00a0There is racial unrest and violence and destruction of property in our streets.These enormous variables make snapshot surveys unreliable, to put it\u00a0mildly.\u00a0Moreover, just like there\u00a0is an\u00a0anti-Trump bias in the vast majority of newsrooms\u00a0that are dominated by liberals and those even farther left, bias exists in polling as well.In these hyper-politicized times, too many polls are deeply flawed. In some cases, this may be deliberate by those on the left. In others, even\u00a0good-faith\u00a0attempts at accuracy fail.Too many polls settle for a sample of registered voters rather than likely voters.\u00a0Furthermore, with the push for all-mail voting on account of the unprecedented COVID-19 crisis, how can we truly ascertain who\u00a0is\u00a0a likely voter and who isn\u2019t?\u202fThese are uncertain times; standard polling practices may not be cutting the mustard this year.\u202fBe that as it may,\u00a0polls showing Trump trailing Biden are getting far more attention than they deserve, particularly in liberal media outlets that make little effort to hide their open and intense hostility to Trump and other Republican candidates.Just look at the Times, where supposedly objective reporters are so filled with anti-Republican bias that they succeeded in getting the publisher to remove the editorial page editor and demote his deputy because the editors dared publish an op-ed by Republican Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas.Biden\u2019s political allies in the media are trying to cement in people\u2019s minds that the outcome of the election is a foregone conclusion,\u00a0just like they\u00a0tried to do in 2016.I recall vividly when I received exit polling information early on election night 2016 that included data from Colorado. The problem was that Colorado has all-mail voting, so there could be no exit polling available.The moral of the story is:\u00a0when you study a poll, make sure you look under the hood for a political agenda\u00a0and flaws on how data is weighed.\u202fLiberal elites are working in concert to defeat President Trump. The media establishment, the political establishment and the academic establishment have gone all-in to take him down \u2014 and the American people see it.Any other leader would have crumbled in the polls long ago but this\u00a0president is an oak with a dedicated movement behind him.Juxtapose the intensity on the Trump side of the ledger with the big questions about Joe Biden\u2019s ability to secure votes in his own right.Can Biden excite enough people to turn out a big vote in 2020?\u202fNo one knows for sure and that\u2019s causing the left a lot of heartburn\u00a0for Democrats.Although he\u2019s currently\u00a0embracing democratic socialists Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, and others on the far-left fringe of the Democratic Party,\u00a0throughout his career Biden has\u00a0taken positions\u00a0on many issues that will demoralize\u00a0this Democratic faction.Biden\u2019s support of crime legislation in 1993 that increased imprisonment of African Americans, his vote in favor of the Iraq war, and his unflinching support for trade agreements that shipped American jobs to China will upset many Democratic voters, once these earlier positions\u00a0become more\u00a0widely known.Over the next three months, Biden will be defined by Trump, just like Bush defined Dukakis in 1988.The American people are going to find out that Biden is a weak puppet of the radical socialist left and is willing to sacrifice the America we know and love in order to get elected.Voters face a clear choice in November. Trump stands for security, prosperity and putting America first. Biden, by definition, stands for the exact opposite and his dangerous policies confirm just that.At the end of the day, the only polling\u00a0that matters\u00a0will be\u00a0the results on Election Day. Just ask all the losing presidential candidates who pollsters told us would become president.", "comment": "(1,832)", "topic": "OPINION", "date": " July 26"}, {"cover": "https://a57.foxnews.com/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/694940094001/bf34062e-99eb-47c1-8b06-78f65dd45289/a257ecba-2846-41a9-b872-a0ea51aef956/1280x720/match/156/88/image.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "title": "Jason Rantz says some politicians, media are convinced that riots will be worth it if Trump loses in November", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/transcript/jason-rantz-says-some-politicians-media-are-convinced-that-riots-will-be-worth-it-if-trump-loses-in-november", "subtitle": "Guests: Jason Rantz, Anthony Napolitano, Ian Smith, Heather Mac Donald, Bill Hagerty, Marc Siegel, Greg Gutfeld", "keyword": "U.S.-China trade and COVID-19", "website": "Fox News", "author": "", "content": "TUCKER CARLSON, HOST: Good evening, and welcome to \"Tucker Carlson Tonight.\" Happy Monday.You can tell a lot about a society by what shocks its leaders. For generations, what shocked the people in charge of this country was political violence, hurting your neighbors for having different opinions. They were appalled by that and they were right to be.Political violence isn't simply an assault on individual Americans, it's an attack on America itself. In this country, we govern by consent, not by force. People with guns don't make our laws, voters do.You may have a Glock in your hand, but on Election Day, you have precisely as many votes as the little old lady who disagrees with you. That's our system. The weak are supposed to have as much power over the government as the strong, and that is the basis of our equality as Americans, something that we should cherish and protect.Political violence immediately short circuits this. It ends democracy. Violence instead returns us to the most primitive of all systems, one in which might makes right. People who hurt others get to do exactly what they want. Everyone else has to obey them. There is no greater threat to civilization than this and we used to understand that because it's obvious.But things have changed. The people who run this country are no longer shocked by political violence. They welcome it. They slyly encourage it. They are its beneficiaries.They tell us the only real crimes are thought crimes. It's okay to set fires or smash strangers in the face with two by fours, so long as you are chanting the correct slogans. If you're on the right team, everything is allowed.But if you dare to dissent from the orthodoxy, you will be swiftly punished. Go ahead and express the wrong opinion. Try it in a meeting, try it on Facebook, they will find you. You will lose your job, your reputation, possibly even your life.The message they're sending you is very clear. Americans are not equal anymore. There are two standards in this country, one standard for them and a very different standard for you.Over the weekend, we saw exactly what they will excuse from their own supporters. Armed mobs of Joe Biden voters torched, buildings, smashed cars, attacked police officers. They rioted. They hurt people, a lot of people -- and the media, watching closely lied about all of it. They pretended it didn't happen. They made excuses for it. They buried the truth in euphemism.The liars of \"The New York Times\" described the riots as quote, \"protests,\" as if the violence was justified or could be justified. Here's the truth about what happened. Here's what actually happened in Seattle over the weekend. Take a look.[VIDEO CLIP PLAYS]CARLSON: Protests? No, these were not protests. These were scenes from a war. The rioters threw rocks, bottles, wood, explosives at police. One explosion left an eight inch hole in a police precinct.Because no lie is too absurd for CNN to tell, the network described violence against police as quote, \"a demonstration against police violence.\" Got that? It's a perfect inversion of the truth worthy of 1984. Ignorance is strength. Freedom is slavery. War is peace.They repeat it because they expect you to believe it and no doubt some do.Meanwhile, Seattle Police Department gamely tried to push back by releasing actual body cam footage of the violence. It is not clear how many people saw it. So, we're going to show some of you -- we're going to show some of it to you right here.[VIDEO CLIP PLAYS]CARLSON: A total of 59 police officers were injured in this demonstration against police violence. CNN would like you to believe they attacked themselves, they did not, not in Seattle, not anywhere.In Oakland, the mobs with helmets and shields attacked a police station. They shot cops with fireworks. They set fire to a courthouse. Here are pictures of it.[VIDEO CLIP PLAYS]CARLSON: According to NBC News, the rioters you just saw were quote, \"protesters.\" They burned the courthouse quote, \"after a peaceful demonstration intensified.\" Oh intensified, just like the World Trade Center collapsed when a commercial airline flight intensified.It's remarkable. You've got to believe there are still normal people working at ABC News, maybe in the tape library or in the cafeteria. Are they watching their own coverage? How can they stand it? The apologies for violence, the relentless shameless lying?It's hard to believe they haven't resigned. They probably have mortgages and kids who feel for them. Just as you feel for the cameraman who would flee the mob in Sacramento over the weekend.They were surrounded and apparently assaulted by 150 Joe Biden voters dressed in black paramilitary gear, and had to run for their lives. You'd think other journalists would be sympathetic to this, they used to be? Not anymore.The stakes are too high. We've got an election coming up and so instead they lie to provide cover for the rioters, the ones who threatened the cameraman.The Sacramento Bee took pains to tell you that the protests are actually peaceful. The newspaper did its best to downplay the violence, including the fact that so-called protesters are trying to disarm police helicopters with laser pointers.One of the peaceful protesters ran through the streets with a chainsaw in order to block traffic, no problem. Nothing to see here.Meanwhile, at mostly peaceful protests in Austin and Aurora, Colorado people were shot. In downtown Louisville, heavily armed militia and military outfits walked through the city threatening violence if police officers weren't sent to jail. No problem, just a protest. In Milwaukee, a black Trump supporter named Bernell Trammell was executed in front of his office in broad daylight. He was killed.In Portland, Oregon, police seized a bag filled with rifle magazines and Molotov cocktails, not a big deal.City leaders in Portland ignored 60 straight days of rioting. It's fine, they say. Really? Here is how Portland looked over the weekend.[VIDEO CLIP PLAYS]CARLSON: This isn't fine. It's not normal. It's not a protest. These aren't children. These are adults, and they're destroying our country. They're completely out of control. They're violent.Are they punished? No. Where's the Justice Department in this? Don't we have an Attorney General? Isn't he supposed to be conservative? Why are we allowing this?Chad Wolf runs the Department of Homeland Security. Wolf, whatever you think of him has been one of the very few officials in Washington, who seems to notice that any of this is happening. He sent Federal law enforcement to Portland to keep the mob from burning down the Federal Courthouse there, which the mob does not own. It is Federal property. They have no right to torch it. It's not theirs. It's ours.For doing that, for being one of the very few to actually push back a little bit, he was punished. The mob came to Chad Wolf's home yesterday, and they threatened him and his family and they didn't do it suddenly. It wasn't subtext. They said it out loud on camera. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We must make social consequences for these men and women.GROUP: Yes, yes.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We must make it uncomfortable for them. We will not be good Germans. We are angry neighbors. You can't live here quietly and is able to live just like us.(END VIDEO CLIP)CARLSON: Oh, she is trying to figure out why the Department of Justice isn't actually doing anything? Why they haven't frog marched the leaders of Antifa in front of the camera? Why they haven't stopped this stuff? While they're acting like they're powerless?Maybe they don't want mobs like this in front of their houses. Maybe mob violence works. \"We must make it uncomfortable for them,\" she says in a megaphone. What does that mean? Well, we don't need to guess because we just spent all weekend watching what it means.Here's the contrast that we should never forget. Things change so quickly. You imagine things have always been this way, but they haven't.There's a presidential election a few months from now. If you disagree with what Chad Wolf has done, you get to vote against Chad Wolf's boss, and Chad Wolf will be out of a job. That's the way we used to do it, when this was a democracy. But not anymore. Now they just go and threaten Chad Wolf's children and the media applaud.Last month, a radio show host in Seattle called Paul Gallant mocked reports that his city was descending into chaos. These were peaceful protests, he suggested. On Twitter, Gallant reported that he saw, quote, \"no burning, pillaging or deaths.\" Of course those things were happening. They existed. We showed you tape of it at the time.But Gallant pretended otherwise. We don't know why we'd have to assume because he thought it would help his team. Then the rioters showed up in the building where he lives, in his apartment building and they destroyed the Starbucks downstairs and that scared him.Now, Gallant says he is buying a gun. Ah, it turns out it's not so easy to lie about violence when it's aimed at you.Jason Rantz is a Seattle based radio host. We're happy to have him on tonight. Jason, thanks so much for coming on. So you just had a lot of violence in the City of Seattle over the weekend. Tell us what you saw and tell us what the reaction from local government was, please.JASON RANTZ, SEATTLE RADIO SHOW HOST: Well, it's almost like we're dealing with a masterclass of gaslighting because I know what I saw and I know what a lot of people who saw the images that I posted online saw, which was violence, which was arson against five construction trailers, which was a Starbucks that was completely ransacked, and someone tried to set it on fire and they didn't know of course stop at Starbucks. They also impacted some other businesses.But we're being told that it's peaceful or maybe it's just a few people, it's a few bad apples in a larger crowd. As if they were redecorating the Starbucks with their rocks, as if they were celebrating police by throwing fireworks at them.What we're seeing is violence. What we saw was a riot and anyone who says otherwise is lying to you. I understand that there's some nuance to go into when you're talking about a very large crowd and there are like two or three bad actors, but the entire crowd is almost full of bad actors.It started off peaceful on Saturday, as they walked to the Juvenile Detention Center. There was about 4,000 to 5,000 people. Then they set it on fire. And then all of a sudden, that crowd was about 1,500.The people who stayed are the bad actors. The people who stayed are the rioters. The people who stayed were saying some horrible things and their goal was not to protest against police brutality. This has nothing to do with George Floyd. This has everything to do with a very specific ideology, and I think that there are politicians and media members who believe that this is going to create enough momentum and chaos to get Donald Trump out of office.I think it's a mistake. I think it's going to backfire on them, but I do think some of them are willing to sit by and see some of these cities complete get destroyed. And yes, some people lose their lives. It's an evil position to take, all because they are justifying, well, if we can get Donald Trump out of office, this guy who was supposed to lead us to the end of civilization, it didn't quite actually happen over the period of the last three and a half years. But this time, it'll happen if he gets reelected. They've convinced themselves this.CARLSON: I don't know what kind of person could justify harming individuals in the name of winning a presidential campaign. I don't think any decent person on either side would ever do that, and I mean it.'RANTZ: He will be --CARLSON: I think that's right. I think that's right. Great to see tonight. Thank you.RANTZ: Good to see.'CARLSON: Well, speaking of violence, one of the epicenters of it in this country, and this has been true for a while now, tragically is Chicago. Two thousand two hundred and forty three people have been shot in the city of Chicago so far this year. How many people is that? It's enough to feel 46 fully loaded school buses, and indeed many of them were children.The mayor of Chicago, Lori Lightfoot doesn't like the police and she is responding to this crisis by demanding more police units outside of her home. Wait a second. She doesn't like police, but she wants more cops outside her home. Why is that? Because her safety is the only thing she cares about.She knows she presides over a city where people are getting killed, and she doesn't want to be one of them.Now, sources tell this show that her district Police Commander refused to move more cops into her neighborhood. He said that his officers are already stretched too thin protecting the citizens of Chicago. For this he was punished, he was promptly reassigned to another unit.We asked the Mayor's Office about this and they angrily denied it. They said the mayor had no role in the reassignment of the Police Commander. Of course, they didn't pledge to jump in and fix it. We'll let you decide whether they're telling the truth or not.Anthony Napolitano is an alderman in the City of Chicago and he joins us tonight. Alderman, thanks so much for coming on.ANTHONY NAPOLITANO, ALDERMAN, CHICAGO: Hi, Tucker. How are you?CARLSON: I'm well, but the idea that the Mayor of Chicago asked for police protection for herself when thousands have been shot in the city so far this year makes me dizzy, the hypocrisy of that.NAPOLITANO: Yes, you know, honestly, I can't attest to that situation in general. But what I can tell you talking to many police officers and many high ranking officers, there are a lot of these commanders, these captains, these lieutenants that are getting to the boiling point right now. They're just -- they feel so understaffed. They don't have enough men and women, police officers on the street, and when they're forced to reallocate police to different portions of the city that can't handle the crime going on right now, they are leaving their districts and their neighborhoods more vulnerable.It's getting to the point right now, like I said before, we're not able to keep up with the rate of attrition because these bosses are retiring. They feel like they're leaving their men and women out there in harm's way and it's a scary point right now for them.CARLSON: So if you look at the crime stats in the city, and they are overwhelming and tragic because each one represents a life ended, or certainly halted, you've got to kind of know -- no honest person could conclude that the police are responsible for 2,400 shootings this year. They're not. The cops didn't do that.What's the purpose of pulling back the police in the middle of a crime wave, honestly?NAPOLITANO: You know, if you actually look at the stats, I think shooting wise in the City of Chicago, police account for maybe 0.06 percent of the shooting.CARLSON: Exactly.NAPOLITANO: Compiled, actually our numbers in eight years is almost 23,000 people were shot. Pulling them back right now, I don't know. It just doesn't -- it doesn't make any sense. We can't -- we can't get enough police officers actually to even take this job right now because of the defund movement and the anti-police movement.But on top of it right now, officers don't -- they're not afraid to be the police, they want to be given the go ahead to be the police and have someone actually back them, someone get behind them and know that they're doing job the best to their ability and mistakes will happen, but you're going to back them on behalf of saving the city.Pulling resources is just -- I live in the 16th District, 32 square miles, sometimes we'll have three to four police officers patrolling the 16th District. That's absolutely ludicrous. We should have anywhere between 32 and 38 on the street in our district, but it's based on the reallocation of officers to other areas. It's forcing officers off this job.CARLSON: It's terrifying. You're one of 50 aldermen. I hope the other 49 listen to you and the mayor. Mr. Napolitano, thanks so much for coming on tonight. I appreciate it.NAPOLITANO: Thanks for having me, Tucker.CARLSON: Well, Major League Baseball started its season last week. That's the good news. The bad news is the coronavirus is already threatening to end it. Dr. Marc Siegel joins us after the break.Plus, we've talked to a New Jersey gym owner several times on the show. He defied the governor's orders. He said he was willing to face the consequences for that. This morning, he was arrested and handcuffed. He joins us after the break.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)CARLSON: The University of Notre Dame in Indiana announced today that it will no longer host a presidential debate this September. The University's President blamed the coronavirus quote, \"Health precautions would have greatly diminished the educational value of hosting the debate on our campus,\" end quote.Now it's possible that's the literal truth in the entire story. On the other hand, given that every major institution in American life opposes Donald Trump's reelection, maybe there's more to it.On the face of it, it does seem like an odd move. Schools usually fight to host debates. It's free advertising for them, Hofstra, Washington University in St. Louis, the chances are you've heard of those places because they hosted presidential debates.But Notre Dame says it doesn't want a debate because not enough students could attend it. Will other schools reach the same conclusion? If they do, could we wind up with an abbreviated number of presidential debates staged by remote on say Facebook or Zoom? Who knows? We don't know.We do know that would certainly help Joe Biden.Well, 11 players and two coaches of the Miami Marlins have tested positive for the coronavirus now. The outbreak comes less than a week after the league launched its short 60-game season. So what does this mean for the rest of the season?Fox News medical contributor, Dr. Marc Siegel joins us tonight with an answer to that question. Doctor, good to see you.DR. MARC SIEGEL, FOX NEWS CHANNEL MEDICAL CONTRIBUTOR: Tucker, in 1969 three things happened. You were born, a man landed on the moon and my miracle Mets won the World Series. And you know what? The American psyche, the national psyche, our spirit is tied into our national pastime baseball.All sports, all eyes are on Major League Baseball, and the problem tonight as you just said is several players on the Miami Marlins in a hotspot -- from a hotspot have tested positive.The problem is not with baseball itself, Tucker. Baseball is a sport that is socially distanced by definition. You're standing in the outfield. You're all alone. You're in the infield. You don't encounter anyone.The problem is that the way baseball is right now, everyone is playing in their home park. They're on the team buses. They're traveling together. They're eating at restaurants. They're sharing equipment. Equipment bags are being brought onto buses.Whereas the NBA and the NFL are doing bubble type techniques where they're playing in one place. NBA in Orlando, NHL -- National Hockey League in Edmonton and Toronto. Major League Baseball needs to survive this season to send a message to all sports. We need our sports. We need Major League Baseball.I want them to consider my prescription for Major League Baseball tonight, consider going to hubs. Consider going to cities and areas where there's not a lot of COVID-19 and not traveling as much and sticking together and not going around to as many restaurants and as many buses and as many planes.Let's restrict some of that and keep baseball going at all costs. Very important, Tucker.CARLSON: I think it is. All parts of this 250-year-old culture are important and that's certainly one of them. Dr. Siegel, thank you so much thanks.SIEGEL: Thanks, Tucker.CARLSON: So we've introduced you to the owners of the Atilus Gym in Bellmawr, New Jersey a couple of times on this show. This morning they were arrested. Why? For defying the state's mandatory shutdown orders. Those arrests come after a three-month standoff between the co-owner of the gym, Ian Smith and the governor of New Jersey, Phil Murphy, both of whom have been on the show.At one point, Smith removed the doors from the gym so the state couldn't keep them shut. Before reopening last May, he announced that he was willing to deal with the consequences of violating state law.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CARLSON: You're openly defying him on television. What do you think's going to happen to you when you do this?IAN SMITH, ATILUS GYM OWNER, BELLMAWR, NEW JERSEY: We're prepared for any and all consequences. Our actions on Monday are going to be grounded in the ideals of civil disobedience.(END VIDEO CLIP)CARLSON: He should have just set a Federal building on fire, screamed the right slogans, Ian Smith would be fine, but he didn't, and so he was arrested. He joins us tonight. Ian, good to see you. Tell us what happened.SMITH: Good evening, Tucker. So from the last time that we spoke, we had lost our newest case of contempt of court and that was on Friday of last week.The governor said that -- and requested in court to take extraordinary measures to stop us from operating a business and Judge Robert Lougy agreed with him. My partner and I had had the doors removed since Thursday and we had not left the building since. We had two weeks' worth of clothing and we were prepared to stay inside at all costs.But we did agree that we would go peacefully if law enforcement came. That time came this morning at about 5:10 this morning, when the County Sheriff walked in the building and said that we were under arrest.Frank and I at that point went peacefully, and when we arrived back after being booked, we had boarded up doors.CARLSON: I hoped the Sheriff was embarrassed. I assume, he was. There are murderers walking free, a lot of them in New Jersey tonight. Maybe they should do something real.You went on this show, you knew that that was wagging a finger in the face of the tyrants who run your state. You did it anyway. Why?SMITH: Because I'm not afraid of tyrants and no American should be, because we outnumber them greatly. And the only thing that they run off of is fear, which is why you see what you see in the media, where they're pumping fear into the coronavirus, when what they should be pumping is solutions.They don't do that. They don't ever offer any solutions. It's wear a mask, shut up and wait for a vaccine. That's not public health, and I won't subscribe to it.CARLSON: That's just the most moving thing I have heard in a long time, and I just want you to restate for our viewers who didn't see your last appearance on this show. How many infections of COVID-19 have been documented in your gym so far? Just to give our audience some sense of the public health threat that you pose.SMITH: At this point, we have record from June that we reopened and allowed visitors to our facility. We have over 13,000 visitors who have come to Atilus Gym in Bellmawr, and not a single case so far.Governor Murphy cannot say that about the long term care facilities that are 100 percent in his control that have been shut down since March and account for over 50 percent of the deaths in the state.CARLSON: Yes, so you pose a documented -- this is not speculation. The health authorities say you pose no threat at all, not one infection and you were handcuffed and arrested because you defied Governor Murphy.You're a brave man, Ian, and I'm grateful that you've come on the show and I hope you will keep us posted as to what happens next.SMITH: Just one more thing to end the night, Tucker, if I could. Governor Murphy asked us for 14 days to shut down -- 14 days today in New Jersey. It is day 132 of the shutdown. And I would just like everybody to think about that long and hard before they support his policies.CARLSON: Yes, once they get power, they never relinquish it. So as you know. Great to see you tonight. Thank you.SMITH: Good night, Tucker.CARLSON: Good night. So, here is the least controversial fact in social science. Children who are raised by two married parents perform much better in school, earn more as adults, much more likely to graduate, much less likely to become addicted to drugs or alcohol, far less likely to go to jail and are healthier.There are many benefits to growing up, in fact, in an intact nuclear family, but two parent households in this country are in steep decline.An update on the state of the American family is next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)CARLSON: One of the most outspokenly conservative professors in the United States died last week, there are not many. Mike Adams taught at the University of North Carolina, Wilmington. He was direct about his views. Adams opposed censorship and thought abortion was wrong.He believed in facts. He believed in historical record. Here's a clip of Adams describing what he thought of campus speech codes.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MIKE ADAMS, PROFESSOR, UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA, WILMINGTON: They consider this to be a political weapon for them to shut down speech that they can't rebut.I've got a definition by the way for hate speech, I think it's speech that the hate -- that the left hates because they lack the intelligence to rebut it.(END VIDEO CLIP)CARLSON: It is one thing for a talk show host to say that, but you can imagine the response when a Professor says it. For articulating his beliefs, Adams faced never ending harassment.After he criticized the tyrannical behavior of the Governor of North Carolina during the coronavirus shutdowns, thousands petitioned for his removal. And in the end, the mob won. The University of North Carolina, Wilmington forced Adams into early retirement. His last day would have been next week.Well, last week, Adams apparently shot himself. But it wasn't enough. The media continued to attack him. NBC News ran a piece entitled, \"Professor behind vile racist and sexist tweets found dead in north carolina home.\" That's real. BuzzFeed ran a story with this headline, quote, \"A Professor who was known for his racist, misogynistic tweets was found dead in his home.\"Imagine doing something like that, writing something like that about a dead man. They didn't think twice. That's who they are. That's what they'd do to you.Well, there's been a lot of research, longitudinal serious research over the decades, and it's very clear, it couldn't be clearer. Children raised by married parents vastly outperform children who weren't on every scale, on average. They're happier, healthier, more successful. They're paid more. They're not in jail. They graduate.So we should be very concerned about a new Senate report. It shows the demise of two parent households has accelerated dramatically in this country. One notable collapse is the percentage of young women who are married, that's dropped from 71 percent in 1962 to 42 percent in 2019.The result of this, people aren't getting married, but they're still having children. That means a massive uptick and out of wedlock births. Out of wedlock births rose from five percent of all births in 1960 to 40 percent of all births today.Heather Mac Donald is the author of \"The Diversity Delusion.\" She's studied these trends carefully, and we're happy to have her on the show tonight. So Heather, the first thing I noticed, and I think it's -- the science of this is so clear, I don't think there's even a debate about it.But I noticed that in affluent neighborhoods like the one I've spent a lot of my life living in, not one person will judge out of wedlock births, but there are no out of wedlock births. Everyone is married and has kids within marriage. What does that tell you?HEATHER MAC DONALD, MANHATTAN INSTITUTE: It tells you that the elites have lost faith in the bourgeois values that they practice, but they're not willing to articulate because they believe that somehow they're associated with white supremacy.We've been hearing a lot, Tucker, about this white privilege meme. That's a poisonous fiction. Here's the real class divide in this country, and sadly, it's also a race divide, the likelihood of growing up with two married parents.I'm going to break a massive feminist taboo here and say that males matter. That fathers matter. That fathers bring a set of values and norms to child rearing, whether it's self-reliance or self-discipline, honor and courage. On average, that complement what mothers can bring.CARLSON: Of course.MAC DONALD: And when you lose that symmetry, and that emotional support for children, that goes so far beyond economic support, which is largely irrelevant, it's the fact that you have twice as much kinship support and people that two parents can spell each other when one is exhausted. That's what results in successful children.And the anarchy that we've lived through with the looting and the rioting of the last month, Tucker, has been preceded by a more slow motion anarchy and breakdown, which is the breakdown of the family because our prisons today are filled almost exclusively with fatherless men.CARLSON: I can't think of any national politician who would say that. I mean, Barack Obama talked about fathers. I don't think he ever once mentioned marriage because unmarried mothers are a core constituency in his party, other than maybe I'm serious, Kanye West. I can't think of anybody who has ever said anything like that. Why?MAC DONALD: The feminists rule our discourse. You're not allowed to say that men matter. I mean, belief survivors believe that they live in a rape culture. I will say though, that before he was elected President, Barack Obama in 2008, gave a Father's Day speech from Chicago that I urge all your listeners, but I urge in particular, the so-called progressives to read, where he gave the facts that you started with, Tucker, about the much greater chance that fatherless boys ended up in prison, end up out of school, end up in gangs.Sadly, Obama did not act on that speech, and the Republicans have not been much better. Part of the problem is, is that so many of them, if they were married initially, are now divorced. So it's a hard thing to turn this around. But we have to because the breakdown of the family is the biggest civilizational catastrophe that we're facing today that is the root of the spiraling crime, insane drive-by shootings that we see in the inner city and the destruction of human potential.CARLSON: I couldn't agree more. The science is completely clear. And by the way, just because you're divorced doesn't disqualify you from telling the truth. If you drink too much, it doesn't mean you want your kids to be alcoholics.I mean, this -- the whole personalist political identity is everything is one of the dumbest ideas we've ever internalized that we have internalized.MAC DONALD: Yes.CARLSON: Heather Mac Donald, really one of our smartest guests ever. Great to see you. Thank you.MAC DONALD: Thanks, Tucker.CARLSON: So Greg Gutfeld, in addition to being a TV star has thought deeply about so-called cancel culture and how to defeat it. It's possible he just wrote a whole book about it. He's here to tell us what he's concluded, next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)CARLSON: So if you're Antifa, you can burn down a Federal building or storm a police station; but if you're you, the rules are different. Say one wrong thing and you're done. That's called cancel culture. Can we stop it?Fox's Greg Gutfeld has thought a lot about this. He has written a new book, \"The Plus: Self-Help for People Who Hate Self-Help.\" It comes out tomorrow. We're happy to have the great Greg Gutfeld on our show tonight.Greg, congrats on the book. What can we do ...GREG GUTFELD, FOX NEWS HOST: Thank you.CARLSON: ... to end -- to cancel, cancel culture?GUTFELD: Well, first I have to say that amazing gym owner was amazing.CARLSON: Amazing.GUTFELD: That beard. I could live in that beard. I could live like a little elf inside a little Keebler hole in his beard.Okay, I had to get that out of the way. Here's the deal with cancel culture.CARLSON: I don't want to think about that.GUTFELD: Yes, you should. Here's the thing about cancel culture. This is the first work around for the First Amendment in history. Because whenever you complain about cancel culture, they will say, you have the First Amendment, freedom of speech. We're just going to ruin your career and take your livelihood and drive you to suicide. So it actually makes the First Amendment meaningless.There's no way First Amendment can help you.CARLSON: Exactly.GUTFELD: So identified the problems, right? Cancel culture defines you at your worst. The past is always present. Something you did a long time ago doesn't matter. If you apologize, that's merely an appetizer, and the media becomes the amplifier for these deeds simply for clicks.So the solution which I have in my book, you need to make cancel culture costly, because right now it's too cheap to pull it off.CARLSON: Yes.GUTFELD: The low barrier for entry to join a mob is nil. So, the solution is to make it expensive and the key is to share the risk. If we stick together, and it's really easy. The price becomes too high for the mob. The only reason why they exist is because we don't stick together.We get scared. We hide. Companies will virtue signal rather than protect their employees. We often need to build in mutually assured destruction.The assumption that cancel culture could rebound on them destroys it. Remember that reporter that canceled the kid who donated all that money to the Children's Hospital? They found like an old tweet. Then like a week later, they found tweets of the reporter. He lost his job. It has to be like that.CARLSON: So you have to use -- I'm not sure I'm for that. I mean, there's no way to not use their tactics and beat them. It's just a disgusting one.GUTFELD: You could be nice.CARLSON: Yes.GUTFELD: It really is. I think there's a good positive part about this in terms of being \"The Plus.\" You should define people by their best intentions. You should everyday ask yourself if you are contributing to mob culture, especially on social media.Sometimes I'm guilty of it, especially if I drink a little wine. So I try to stay off. We tend to look at Twitter as an ex. We're trying to impress them, rather than looking at it as a harmful, unknown quality.The reason why Tucker Carlson is the happiest talk show host on Earth, is because he never sets foot on social media. I'm not even sure he knows how to turn on a computer. That's why he doesn't care.And one of the solutions to cancel culture is not giving a damn. The problem is, the culture can still care about you. You can't just turn off the weather. They can follow you everywhere.But I think that you have to share the risk, and everyday ask yourself, is there a way to help people who are in trouble?CARLSON: I think that's really wise advice and on your way out, I just -- this is for you, Greg Gutfeld. We have a picture of the beard.GUTFELD: Yes.CARLSON: You'd like to live inside. The rotted oak tree you'd like to tote your acorns to.GUTFELD: Do you know how cozy that would be?CARLSON: I can't believe it.GUTFELD: I'm all for cozy.CARLSON: I think we indulged that.GUTFELD: I am all for cozy.CARLSON: Unbelievable. Congrats on the book.GUTFELD: You endorsed it.CARLSON: I sort of.GUTFELD: Thank you, buddy.CARLSON: Great to see you. Well, there's been a lot happening in this country, international pandemics, trade wars, domestic upheaval have rocked this country in a way it hasn't been in a long time.Who is benefiting? China is benefiting? We will talk to someone who has thought a lot about how they're benefiting, next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)CARLSON: There is evidence including from Chinese scientists, the coronavirus began in a Chinese lab. The Chinese government certainly lied about its spread, then engaged in sketchy trade practices that destroyed millions of American manufacturing jobs.Fentanyl floods in from China. Hundreds of thousands of Americans have died from that.So China has caused havoc, are they benefiting from it? That's the question for Bill Hagerty. He is running for Senate in Tennessee. He's in the middle of a tough primary. This segment has nothing to do with that.We've asked to talk to Mr. Hagerty because it was knowledge of Asia. He served as the U.S. Ambassador to Japan and we're happy to have him on tonight. Mr. Hagerty, thanks so much for coming on.So the concern would be that after all the problems we've dealt with, thanks to China, they are taking advantage of our weakness to increase their advantage. Do you think that's happening?BILL HAGERTY (R), FORMER U.S. AMBASSADOR TO JAPAN: Absolutely, Tucker. I know that that's the case. That's one of the key reasons that President Trump has endorsed me for the United States Senate. He knows that he needs an ally that understands the scene in China up close and personal. I've dealt with them. We've got to deal with China strictly and toughly.CARLSON: The fentanyl question is one that baffles me. So hundreds of thousands of Americans have died from ODs, far more than have died from COVID-19.HAGERTY: Indeed.CARLSON: That's chemicals coming from China primarily. Nobody ever says that. Why?HAGERTY: We should be saying it. President Trump negotiated in Buenos Aires to stop this with the Chinese Premier. They haven't. Again, we need to stand up strong to deal with this.They're killing Americans. They're sending the material over to Mexico. It's coming across a very porous border. We've got to stand with President Trump to seal the border to secure it to stop the lawlessness and in this drug trade.CARLSON: Does it seem like tensions between the U.S. and China are escalating to a new level? There are signs, consulates closing, et cetera, that they are.HAGERTY: Yes.CARLSON: Are they?HAGERTY: Indeed, indeed, Tucker and as U.S. Ambassador, to Japan, I've seen it up close. They've advanced on us militarily. The minute we step back in the South China Sea, they advanced their forces. That's why President Trump has sent two aircraft carrier groups out that direction.We've got to stand up to them militarily. Diplomatically, you've seen what they've done. They overtook the World Health Organization. I applaud President Trump for taking us out of that group.And economically, they've been a predator for years. We've seen Presidents both Democrat and Republican look the other way as they continued to mount their aggression.They've taken our jobs. They've destroyed our economy with this pandemic, and they've killed over 150,000 Americans. They need to be held to account and I look forward to serving to help do that.CARLSON: Bill Hagerty, I appreciate it. Thanks for coming on tonight. Former U.S. ambassador to Japan.HAGERTY: Thank you so much, Tucker. Great to be with you.CARLSON: Thank you very much.

Goya Foods. It's a true Hispanic American success story and one of the most charitable companies in the country, but because its CEO stood side-by-side with President Trump yesterday some vicious and powerful voices on the Left, they're calling for a boycott naturally. Goya's CEO Robert Unanue is here on why he won't back down. But first, the madness of voting against yourself. That's the focus of tonight's angle. \u00a0Some Americans may be thinking that voting for Joe Biden in November will be a vote against Trump, but maybe it's time to look at things a different way, namely if you vote for Biden what exactly will you be voting for. How will America change? First thing, you have to realize is that anything Biden says about being tough on China, about pushing Made in America stuff is a total lie. Biden has spent nearly half a century in politics including eight years as Vice President to show us that he was an economic populist suddenly. I don't think so. Well, this latter-day attempt to rebrand himself as some sort of liberal Pat Buchanan on trade manufacturing is a complete and utter farce. Instead of America first Biden's policies have always put American workers last. And after Biden's speech yesterday the day before, come on, you might have been wondering where have you heard all that before. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN (D), PRESUMPTIVE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: When the federal government spends taxpayer's money, we should use it to buy American products and support American jobs. DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We will always live by two simple rules Buy American and hire American. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Well, Trump of course sees right through what Biden is trying to do. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: He plagiarized from me, but he can never pull it off. He likes plagiarizing. \u00a0(END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Of course, a little joke about Biden's problem with that Neil Kinnock speech all those years ago. \u00a0Biden's progressive cheerleaders. They know that Trump's full-throated embrace of economic nationalism. It's one of his strongest appeals, thus they've tried to co-opt the message. \u00a0(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN (D-MA): He's being very intentional about who's been left out of this economy. We are really encouraging everybody and giving them opportunities to participate in this economy. It will be transformative \u00a0(END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Transformative. Any cursory look at Biden's long record demonstrates he's a staunch unrepentant globalist on trade, on immigration and of course on foreign affairs. He's been on the opposite side of Trump on every major policy battle, a President Biden will install globalists in key positions in the State Department and the Pentagon taking us back to the Obama days of constantly apologizing to the world for our past sins and giving China and Europe basically whatever they want. Remember back in 2011, Biden was actually rooting on China. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BIDEN: There's a debate here in the United States and quite frankly throughout most of the West is whether a rising China was in the interest of the United States and the wider world. As a young member of the Foreign Relations Committee, I wrote, and I said, and I believe then what I believe now that a rising China is a positive, positive development not only for China but for America and the world writ large. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Just that line alone should completely disqualify him from the presidency. How does that work out for Hong Kong, Joe? Could have been more wrong on more issues and do not think for a second that things are going to calm down on the domestic front if Biden is elected. The Left will be emboldened not chastened by a Biden win. Retribution will be a dividend for the squad in the Biden era and it's just going to get worse. They don't want you to worry about cancel culture in fact AOC says, check your privilege tweeting, the term cancel culture comes from entitlement. Odds are you're not actually canceled. You're just being challenged, held accountable or unliked. Well, tell that to those who lost their livelihoods. We're going to talk to a man who is being subject to the cancel culture in just a few moments. And I think it's all bad now just wait until a Biden administration. If anyone including any company does something the Left doesn't like, they'll come under DOJ scrutiny and the Bill of Rights, it's not going to do much good for you. After all, that was written by a bunch of old dead white slave holders. Moments like the Tea Party will be treated, I don't know, like moments for domestic terrorists. Black Lives Matter, they'll be treated like heroes. Religious people, least the ones that don't go along with the radical left will be Investigated for hate crimes. Heck, Biden already threatened to rescind the Obamacare exemption for groups like Little Sisters of the Poor after that Supreme Court decision the other day. And, homeschoolers, forget it. You're going to fake face such strict controls; you'll just go back to public school. College and high school sports teams, they're going to be in trouble. And media companies will face pressure by the FCC and other regulatory bodies. And if you take the Biden administration to court because you want to challenge any of this stuff, well, you're going to find that it has at least five justices in Washington to act as its rubber stamp. Meanwhile, laws that are on the books that they don't like will become meaningless. No more enforcement of the immigration or drug laws, bienvenidas to los. Of course, crime will rise as cops are taken off the streets and replaced with Left-wing social workers and therapists. Biden has already moved away and way, way, way to the Left on that issue. \u00a0(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BIDEN: The last thing you need is an up armored Humvee coming into a neighborhood. It's like the military's invading. They don't know anybody. They become the enemy. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And we agree that we can redirect some of the funding? BIDEN: Yes, absolutely. \u00a0(END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Wow. And good luck complaining about any of this to the press. After all, they've got nothing more at this point that the propaganda arm of the DNC, if Biden actually wins, they'll work even harder to protect him. \u00a0(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: There is no scenario where Donald Trump even competes with Joe Biden, who drips empathy. \u00a0UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We were talking about this recently on TV with a different speech. And you point out, you know, just the empathy that the Biden empathy-- UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We really heard from him. He was trying to say to people, look, I see you. I'm feeling your pain. \u00a0(END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: But wait. I know what you're saying. How could the wealthy actually support Biden if it's a virtual certainty that crime will skyrocket, taxes will go up? Come on. The rich are always going to figure out a way to, you know, squirrel away their money and they're always going to figure out a way to be shielded by private security and their gated communities. That's why that's the way it works in countries like Mexico and in Guatemala. And that's where we're headed under Biden. For a long time, many of you have been very happy that you don't have to live in Left-wing cities like Baltimore, New York, or San Francisco. But in just a few months, you may find out exactly what it's like. Finally, let's not forget that a vote for Biden is a vote to erase our history, our national memory, and our traditions, which brings us to the riots. Most people on the right, they're frustrated about the ongoing destruction. But for now, it's mostly contained in areas where the rioters feel safe. The mayors of Chicago and St. Louis are never going to arrest and prosecute these thugs. Yet that's only true so long as Republicans hold the White House. If the Left gets control of the DOJ, the rioters are going to feel safe from prosecution almost anywhere. In fact, they'll know that anyone who interferes with them will risk federal investigation. Biden won't have to order people to do much of anything like what like blow up the Mount Rushmore. No, he's not going to do that. He just won't do anything to stop or punish the folks who try to, as Nancy Pelosi says. \u00a0(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA): I don't care that much about statues. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Done by a commission or the city council, not a mob in the middle of the night, throwing it into the heart. PELOSI: People would do what they do. \u00a0(END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Being a citizen is a duty, and duties aren't always easy or fun to carry out. Well, these days when there's so much hatred toward our country and the media, I know it's really tempting to tune it all out and say, I'm not looking at it. Hide our heads under the covers and wait for the storm to pass. But this isn't a storm and it's not going to pass. It's a vicious and well-funded movement to take away your power and your money and give them to people who want to crush you. But patriotic Americans are starting to resist this unconstitutional series of edicts and actions of their mayors and their governors. And young and old alike must respectfully refuse to submit to this new normal that keeps us out of work, out of churches and out of schools. We have to teach the Democratic Party once and for all that attacking us and aligning with the radical socialist fringe is going to cost them dearly. And we can absolutely do this. We've beaten the Left many times before and we can do so again. In November, a vote for Trump is a vote to preserve the thing that makes America the best country on earth, our freedom. And that's the angle. \u00a0The president's re-election prospects, well, they rest in large part on how well he can do with women voters, especially suburban women voters, this November. A Washington Post ABC News poll from May showed that Biden's lead among that group was even stronger than Hillary Clinton's four years ago. 56 percent of that voting block favors Joe Biden compared to just 42 percent for Clinton. Now, this is where Trump is in trouble. But it's not all gloom and doom. Have the Democrats needlessly boxed themselves in on two key issues that are important to women? Now, Democratic politicians, lefties, school administrators and teachers are the main impediment to schools opening in the fall, especially teachers' unions. Parents know that the science says that the kids should be back in school. But Democrats seem to be ignoring that. Now, the other area is the burgeoning effort to defund, dismantle or just further weaken the police. Now, surprisingly, empowering lawless mobs to roam the streets isn't exactly appealing to we women voters, especially women raising families. So, I think Trump has a real opportunity to peel off some of this crucial support away from Biden and, of course, to the Trump campaign. He needs to focus on three things. Reopening our schools. You saw a little bit of that this week. Reclaiming our safety, going after those people who are lawless in the streets. And rebuilding our economy. And he's well on his way to doing that. Joining me now, Sarah Carter, Fox News Contributor, host of the Sara Carter Show Podcast. Also, with me, Tom Bevan, co-Founder and President, Real Clear Politics. And Lara Logan, host of Lara Logan Has No Agenda on Fox Nation. Tom, let me start with you. This is a kind of seems like a conundrum for Republicans. Certain election cycles. But are suburban women among the persuadable at this point in the election or is it all baked in already? They're immovable. \u00a0TOM BEVAN, CO-FOUNDER OF REAL CLEAR POLITICS: I don't think that they're immovable. They have strong opinions about Trump and more with his style than with his actual policies. As you point out, there is support. There was a poll that just came out this week, Maris poll of New York. And get this, 62 percent of folks in the suburbs of New York and 60 percent of those upstate disagree with the defund the police movement. 55 percent of people in New York City approve of that. So, you have this real disconnect between folks in New York City and folks in the suburbs and upstate on the issue of defunding the police and that's New York, which is a very blue state. What do you take that to the swing states and in the Midwest? I think there is a real opportunity for Trump, if he can do it stylistically in a way that would appeal to suburban women to push his law and order message and make that a positive for him. \u00a0INGRAHAM: Sara is part of the point here for Trump to say something like, well, you might not at times like my tone or maybe even my tweets, but no one will fight harder for your safety at home, in the streets and your economic security and your ability of your kids to go to school. It's almost like he has to do a little bit of that. It seems in order to, you know, convince these women that they're not voting against him, really, if they vote for Biden, they're voting for more chaos. \u00a0SARA CARTER, THE SARA CARTER SHOW PODCAST: That's absolutely true, Laura. I think that's such a great point. And that's something that I brought up in the past before is reaching out to female voters, is saying, look, I know there's things about me, like you said, that you don't like. But I am here. I'm a president of Law and Order. I'm going to get your kids back to school. These are the facts. The Democrats are playing you and they really are. They're putting our kids in the middle of this political football. Laura. And it's so unfair. Our children have been through enough. They need some semblance of normalcy so that they can move forward. And so, do the families. And the two most important things for female voters and for mothers and for women in the United States of America is their children's education and the security of their families. And if the president can move and just walk across that line and say, look, I'm here for you, I'm going to make this happen. I know you don't think I'm the most perfect guy. But if you vote for Biden, you are going to lose this because the Democrats have been giving way too much up to the radical leftists. And we can see that from Seattle to New York. \u00a0INGRAHAM: And Lara, I think I get the sense from the moms in my mom group who aren't political. These aren't political people that they sometimes the tweet they don't like from Trump, but they're really turned off by some of these Democrat leaders who are excusing the mobs like Nancy Pelosi is what she said about the Christopher Columbus statues being torn down. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: In Little Italy, the status of Christopher Columbus was removed. PELOSI: Well, you know, I don't even have my grandmothers hearing. I'm not one of those people who's wedded to a statue to somebody, some place is an important thing. I don't care that much about statues. \u00a0(END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: She basically went on to say, people are going to do what they're going to do. Lara, what about that? Vandalism in the street, does that sell for women? \u00a0LARA LOGAN, INVESTIGATIVE JOURNALIST: Well, you know, Laura, you hear about it all the time, right? Every channel you watch, every newspaper you pick up. You're pretty much getting only one perspective on this constantly day and night. And so many of the women that I speak to are extremely frustrated. And because they feel that they're being completely ignored, there's a lot of talk about the silent majority. And what they're doing is screaming from the rooftops. We're not silent. We're just completely and utterly disregarded. We're just being overlooked. There's nobody out there that's standing up for these values and standing up for what it is that we care about and what we believe in. And when you see all the talk online about, for example, The New York Times had an editorial where one of their opinion writers, Charles Blow, I mean, under a headline that said how white women use themselves as instruments of terror against black men. There's an entire editorial about that. I mean, he wrote here, there are too many next, charred bodies and drowned souls for these white women not to know precisely what they're doing. They're using their white femininity as an instrument of terror against black men. So, there's a real sense and a real feeling amongst some women in this country that the values, the things that they hold dear, the things they hold on to, the things they've known all their lives, that these are being torn down. And there's a real opportunity here for the leaders to want to stand up and stand up for all women of all races. This isn't a black, white thing. This isn't even in many respects a Republican-Democrat thing. I speak to many women who are moderate women from both sides of the aisle, who are very concerned about really what the direction that they see the country going. And just frustrated that they're not being heard. In fact, no one's even talking to them, right. No one cares about them. They just completely disregard it. \u00a0INGRAHAM: And I think this is an opening. I really do for Trump. He ought to comeback for suburban women and some of the pollsters, Tom. Break it down, suburban white women. I know. That's how sometimes they break down these polls. \u00a0But I think safety, security, prosperity, reopening schools, reestablishing order, the home. The idea of home is very powerful, especially for women. And to me, those themes, they need to be hit and hit harder and more effectively by the Republicans if they're going to make up some of the ground they've lost, Tom. \u00a0BEVAN: I think that's right. And I think, you know, if Trump style isn't exactly right, this is where someone like Ivanka could really be a real asset to the campaign going out and making that argument. Just one more thing to Nancy Pelosi's comments, I mean, that plays exactly into what Donald Trump wants to do, which is that he wants to make this not a referendum on him, but a choice between him and Joe Biden and say, look, the Democrats are not willing to stand up to the mob. And that's exactly what she did right there. She just was not willing to say. Joe Biden in his press conference tried to split the baby and basically say some monuments are bad and some are good, and we need to protect them. But he really hasn't been very forceful in this. And Trump is really sort of is laid out and staked his claim on this issue. And to the extent Democrats are unwilling to stand up to the mob, it plays to his advantage. \u00a0INGRAHAM: They can't. They got to ride that mob, the energy all the way they think, to the election. I think people say, Sara that the Republicans have gotten themselves in a trick box here with a pandemic. I think the Democrats are just as much of a trick box with the Far Left because they do not resonate, I think, with most women. And to that one of the more shocking developments has been watching some of these big city mayor's gaslights the country over these recent crime spikes. \u00a0(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: There's not one cause for something like this, there's a lot of different pieces. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We have in some ways the perfect storm. We have almost three months of COVID-19. \u00a0UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It's just this perfect storm of distress in America. People are obviously anxious and even angry about COVID-19. \u00a0UNIDENTIFIED MALE: If you look at the gun laws that are on the books. We saw that just over the weekend and many American cities. It's that same kind of death cult mentality. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: The death cult, Sara, because, you know, only Republican churchgoers can spread the virus or cause a situation where it encourages violence. OK, come on. \u00a0CARTER: Yes. But rioters. But rioters, Laura. Protesters, thousands of people marching in the streets. There was no cause for concern when that was happening. But look, they have box themselves in a corner. We see that in democratic cities that are run, we see with the crime and violence in Chicago, we see what's happened in New York. We see what's happening in San Francisco, in Los Angeles, you know, the Democrats have really put themself in a corner. And I agree with Tom. This silent majority, you know, is not silent anymore. And I think Americans are starting to speak up. And if the President can cross that line, if he can get a Ivanka Trump out there to talk more to the women and he himself deliver that message because it's such an important message, he just needs to pound on it a little bit harder and tell people, look, you've got a choice here in November. You can go in this direction with Joe Biden and see utter chaos. Your children will not be in school. Look at what's happened in Democratic run strongholds. Or we can build this economy back up again. We'll have your children back in school. And we're going to be the government of law and order here. And we're going to stop this from exacerbating itself. That's the real challenge right now. And that's what the Republicans need to do as well. INGRAHAM: Yes. Lara, really quickly, is it essential that the voters decide electing Biden will calm things down or electing Biden is going to embolden the rioters, the chaos? I mean, that's kind of what Biden is banking on. And I think the message he's trying to put out there. \u00a0LOGAN: It's interesting you make that point or because what I've heard from many women that I've spoken to is that this election for them isn't even about Trump, it's about the principles. If you believe in the principle of, you know, the right to practice your religion, whether you're a Muslim or whether you're Jewish or whether you're Christian, that you don't have those rights at the moment. In California, you are not allowed to sing in church, that if you believe in freedom of speech, you're not allowed to speak out and say what you think these days. You're a racist and a bigot if you vote for Trump. You're a racist and a bigot if you say anything that goes against the grain, if you talk out, if you question the pandemic, if you question climate science, you're a denier. You're endangering people's safety. There's a real sense among many people in this country that freedom of speech, freedom of religion, these things are at risk right now as they in a way that has never been experienced in previous lifetimes. Now, those issues are going to be there, regardless of whether Trump is president or not. You're still going to be voting on those issues in the next election, no matter who wins this one. So that's what I'm hearing from lots of people. That's what Biden has got going against him right now is that he's not seen as standing up for those things. INGRAHAM: Yes, liberty versus lockdown. What is it going to be, freedom or intimidation? Panel, fascinating discussion. Thank you so much. Great to see all of you tonight. \u00a0With the FDA refusing to take down its warning over hydroxychloroquine, two doctors have taken matters into their own hands. What they told President Trump, next. \u00a0(COMMERCIAL BREAK) INGRAHAM: Now, despite the media and the medical establishment's claims otherwise, hydroxychloroquine has been found to be so effective in a recent study that it cut the mortality rate in half for COVID. Now, one wonders how many lives have been lost due to these political teeth gnashing and purposeful politicization of the drug by some of President Trump's political adversaries. And it's a drug that's safe and has been used for decades and decades. And although the FDA still issues a warning about using the drug, two prominent doctors that are now pushing for it to be offered in small over- the-counter doses. Now here to tell us more is Dr. Simone Gold. She's a board-certified emergency physician working on the frontlines during the pandemic. And Dr. Richard Urso, an ophthalmologist, practicing in Houston, Texas. Dr. Gold tell us about your plan and why it's so important to get this done fast. \u00a0DR. SIMONE GOLD, EMERGENCY MEDICINE SPECIALIST: Thank you so much, Laura, for having me on the show. You know, I've been tracking the progress of this pandemic and the reaction to the pandemic for months, long before maybe January, February. And initially, I was very excited about hydroxychloroquine, and it was very distressing that the media pounced all over this as though it wasn't a good option after the President endorsed it. So, we've known for decades as physicians that hydroxychloroquine is safe. And the evidence is pouring in that it's also effective as well. In early and in prophylactic treatment for COVID-19, you know, the President didn't pick hydroxychloroquine out of thin air. There was a lot of evidence to suggest that it would be helpful. And now that this evidence is coming in like a tsunami, it's going to be unstoppable. But because there has been so much politicization of the drug, I just suggest that we make it over-the- counter simply like we do in the rest of the world. \u00a0INGRAHAM: Oh, I can hear them. I can hear heads exploding across the country tonight by your advocating for that. Now, I just want to remind everybody, this is what Dr. Fauci, who wants us to lock all down again. What he said about back in May. \u00a0(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES: Clearly, the scientific data is really quite evident now about the lack of efficacy, fraud, and even the possibility that there could be not could be. But there is, you know, the likelihood that under certain circumstances might be rare. But you'd see it adverse events. \u00a0(END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Well, I could hear plaintiffs' attorneys, if this were a practicing physician with all the data we have now, Dr. Urso. The new Mount Sinai study that found it associated with reduced mortality, as well as the Henry Ford study, that this these comments about the drug seem almost akin to malpractice. How does Fauci, and why does Fauci seem to want to deny its efficacy? Dr. Urso. \u00a0DR. RICHARD URSO, OPHTHALMOLOGIST: Laura, thank you. The political back story, I always have a hard time trying to figure out, but he is clearly wrong on what he said. Hydroxychloroquine is super safe. I particularly have a lot of experience with it. I've several thousand patient visits to discuss specifically the toxicity of this drug over my last 30 years. It's a super safe drug. It's safer than Tylenol, aspirin, Motrin. It's been around, a billion prescription. In the largest analysis ever there is probably 50 patient deaths all time that have been attributed to the drug. So for him to make claims like that -- the only thing I can say is he's right in some respects, if you give toxic doses, if you give 34 milligrams per kilograms instead of giving like 6.5, yes, you probably will have adverse events. And in those studies he's citing, they gave massively high dosages and what I would considering to be inappropriate dosages. So I think, if I can add just one little thing, Laura, it's that this QT interval that everybody is so scared of -- the heart recharges every time it beats, and it recharges. And the only thing I can tell you is I've been working with this drug for 30 years, OK, and I've never had a patient taken off of it from a heart issue. And I've went out of my way to talk to cardiologists about this over the last four months. Not a single one has taken a patient off for this reason. INGRAHAM: I want to get into this, and I don't mean to interrupt, but Dr. Gold, I have heard repeatedly that doctors who are pushed to prescribe this to patients, knowing it works and knowing it's safe, have been targeted. This is like a medical cancel culture applied to this particular medication. No one is saying it is a cure, by the way, but it reduces the viral load in all of the patients that Dr. Smith has treated, most all of the patients he has treated at an early level. The Turks have had incredible success, obviously, in India, and other countries. But doctors being targeted now and being threatened, Dr. Gold, what about that? DR. SIMONE GOLD, EMERGENCY MEDICINE SPECIALIST: Well, for sure. I absolutely myself have experienced that. I know many doctors who have been targeted and threatened and sanctioned, risk losing their jobs. Absolutely, they're brought up by the state medical board. And I'll come close to saying, more than you -- it is a cure. If somebody says I can give you the best chemotherapy agent or give you the option of not getting cancer in the first place, I will take not getting the cancer. So you have to understand that the COVID disease is really two different problems. If you get the virus and you treat it early, it's one problem. But if you get it late and treat it late, it's a whole different disease. So hydroxychloroquine given early, prophylactically treated, prophylactically before you get sick or for early treatment when you early are sick, it's very effective. INGRAHAM: Doctor, so really quickly, really quickly, Peter Navarro has pointed to the national stockpile of hydroxychloroquine, that that needs to basically be moved out and used where, the indication is used where it's most effective. Is that a good sign? URSO: That's a good sign. I'm glad they're doing that. The problem is the fear factor for physicians of reprisals. So that's what we have to get past. The fear of reprisals and also, basically this misinformation campaign when they gave toxic, massive doses has really tainted the drug in some respect. So we've got to get past those two issues. The drug is super safe in its normal doses. INGRAHAM: The FDA, the president has got to step in here. The FDA, the good people there I know, they are disserving him right now. I've got a frog in my throat talking about this. URSO: Agreed. INGRAHAM: All right, thank you so much doctors. Great to see you. And has Biden met a new public speaking enemy? We're going to show you how nature rained on his parade. And who do you think has more fashionable face masks. Raymond Arroyo, \"Friday Follies,\" next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) JACKIE IBANEZ, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Good evening, and live from America's news headquarters, I am Jackie Ibanez in New York. A short time ago President Trump commuted the prison sentence of his longtime friend and confidante Roger Stone. The 67-year-old was due to report to a federal prison on Tuesday to serve three years and four months. He was convicted last year of obstructing a Congressional investigation into Russian interference of the 2016 presidential election. The president has long maintained that Stone was the victim of a witch hunt, suggesting he was not trying to intervene on his behalf. Stone had openly lobbied for a commutation or pardon. Prosecutors wanted Stone to serve at least seven years behind bars, but Attorney General William Barr overruled the decision, prompting all four career prosecutors working on the case to quit. Democrats criticize the commutation as inappropriate and unprecedented. I'm Jackie Ibanez. Now back to \"The Ingraham Angle.\" For all of your headlines, log on to . INGRAHAM: It's Friday. And that means it's time for \"Friday Follies.\" Joining us now with all the details, Raymond Arroyo, FOX News contributor. Raymundo, I never thought I'd say it, but maybe Joe should have stayed down below. A union event and a speech this week, what did you see? RAYMOND ARROYO, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, more of the same, Laura. Even in very controlled environments with preplanned questions and prompters, Biden has a knack for losing his train of thought and getting, you know -- I'm going on too long, I'm sorry. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BIDEN: I believe this with every fiber of my being. We're posed -- what I propose is, is -- it can be done. I think we are in a position to really make it happen. Critical laws like the PRO Act to strengthen collective bargaining, on politics like prevailing -- look, I guess I'm getting -- I'm taking too much time, but you know? (END VIDEO CLIP) ARROYO: He is taking too much time. INGRAHAM: Yes, yes. I like the posed. I'm posed. What? What is the squinting? He needs toothpicks. He needs little toothpicks to open his eyes, poor guy. ARROYO: He is reading things he doesn't understand. It's such a shame. But this is why there is such fear in the Biden camp about a debate with Trump. Contrary to the spin, he stumbled through nearly every primary debate as well, Laura, with Kamala Harris and Beto. If you can't beat those people, Trump is going to come out looking like Rocky when this thing is over. And even when Biden attempted to steal some of Trump's America first thunder during a speech yesterday, nature intruded, as he started. There were more birds than a Hitchcock film. (LAUGHTER) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BIDEN: These are not somebody else's children. They are all our children. They are children, those children are the kite strings. And given a chance, just a chance, ordinary Americans can and have done extraordinary things. (END VIDEO CLIP) ARROYO: Was Tippi Hedren part of the advance team there, Laura? I don't know what was going on. But look, I know this. And I guess it might have been at the Philly Aviary. I'm not sure. But then Biden broke, or tried to invoke, rather, unions, and the skies turned dark. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BIDEN: The only way to deal with abuse of power is with power. And labor, unions, are the only ones that I have capacity to do it. If it's raining outside, come on, guys. I don't want anybody out there -- are you guys the rain? Or is that not rain? (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Jelly, jelly, jelly, it's time to get out of the shower. My speech is -- I'm posed, I'm posed to be ending but the chickadees aren't believing my America first thing. The sparrows weren't even buying it. ARROYO: No, there might be a weatherman future in Biden's basement. We'll see. INGRAHAM: Very odd the rains came and the birds tweeted. Biden isn't the only one trying to mask his policies. Dr. Deborah Birx tried to turn Wednesday's Coronavirus Task Force doom and gloom session into a runway event. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DR. DEBORAH BIRX, WHITE HOUSE CORONAVIRUS RESPONSE COORDINATOR: I know some of you watch what I wear, so I'm wearing this especially today. This came from the Salt River Tribe. Masks can be a fashion statement. (END VIDEO CLIP) (END VIDEO CLIP) ARROYO: Laura, now she is the Anna Wintour of the virus set I guess. Not to be outdone, Assistant Secretary for Health Admiral Brett Giroir, he made his own fashion statement. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ADM. BRETT GIROIR, HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES ASSISTANT SECRETARY: Since we are breaking on our face coverings, this was made by a small religious community in Pennsylvania who are helped by the public health service, and they hand sewed these for a lot of our officers to match our operational dress, those blue uniforms. (END VIDEO CLIP) ARROYO: Laura, I guess we all now have to do our own faux couture masks, is that routine now? INGRAHAM: What are you wearing? Raymond, what are you wearing? ARROYO: I'm wearing a Brooks Brothers piece. Look at this, you just put this on, and not only are you fashionable, but you look like an oompa loompa or something, I guess. The head gets cut off. I see people wearing these without the nose in, so maybe this will work. What do you have on? INGRAHAM: Mine, do you see what mine says? It's hard to, I don't know if they can zoom in. It's from the Alamo. It says come and take it with the Alamo canon. ARROYO: I love it. INGRAHAM: So that's my couture statement. ARROYO: Laura, a very underground group made this for me. It's the Wayne family. How about this one? INGRAHAM: Oh, what a goofball. ARROYO: I'll protect monuments on weekends, Laura. INGRAHAM: You are defeating on purpose. (LAUGHTER) INGRAHAM: All right, up next, attempting to boycott Goya, a true American success story. We'll bring you the story with the CEO next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) INGRAHAM: Now, the left will have you believe that cancel culture isn't a real thing. Judd Legum, the founder Think Progress and former Hillary Clinton campaign staffer, tweeted \"Cancel Culture is something that does not exist but is a very popular concept among people who do terrible things and don't like to be held accountable.\" You can tell that to Goya CEO Bob Unanue for his mere presence and praise of the Trump administration's Hispanic Prosperity Initiative yesterday. Powerful left-wingers including Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez are now calling for boycotts of this incredibly successful company. Not only is AOC attempting to destroy a Hispanic success story, she is spitting in the face of someone who has likely helped her and her constituents get fed. In the past few months alone, Goya has donated millions of pounds of food to the U.S. food banks, including 100,000 pounds to the New York City Food Bank to be distributed to families in need during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Goya CEO Bob Unanue joins me now. Bob, this does not surprise me at all. I was so gratified to see you at the White House and speaking candidly about what your thoughts are about what the president has tried to do here in this difficult time for the country. What's the real cause of all of this backlash we are seeing against you and your company today? BOB UNANUE, CEO, GOYA FOODS: Well, thank you, Laura, great to be with you. The United states is the largest Hispanic country in the world after Mexico. And every ethnicity is present in this country from South America to the Central America to Spain to every country, every Hispanic country on the planet. Goya has been in business for the last 84 years. Since 2000 the U.S. Hispanic population has doubled. The Goya brand is extremely iconic, and it means something to every ethnicity. That's very powerful. And that can't be taken down, I don't believe, in a moment. But the fact of the matter is, our country is very divided. I'm 66 years old, and I have been through a few decades, let's say. And in my lifetime, I've never seen the country more, unfortunately, divided. I like the saying there are those who are born to love and build and others to hate and destroy. And unfortunately, there is a movement of hatred and destruction. Who wants to see houses of worship burn, businesses people have put their whole lives savings and to build the business, and to only have people come along and destroy it. They have no right to do that. And we have to stand for prosperity. We are the most prosperous country in the world. Pre-COVID, we were the lowest Hispanic and black unemployment in history. And even post-pandemic, we are still the most powerful and most prosperous country in the world. And so we have to remain positive, we have to continue to build and grow. INGRAHAM: Bob, will you be one of these big figures in American life -- you have seen it in Hollywood, you've seen it in sports -- who is forced to apologize for standing with President Trump or next to President Trump? Will you do that? UNANUE: The White House has an issue on Hispanic prosperity, and I was asked by the White House to attend a roundtable and even be part of a new commission, which is yet to be named. But of course, when you are called to service, to serve our country in whatever way possible, I am blessed to have the fortune of being ahead of a company that is iconic. And so -- INGRAHAM: So the answer is no. The answer is no, you are not going to apologize for standing next to President Trump. UNANUE: Hell no. Hell no. INGRAHAM: And Bob, what do you say finally to young Hispanics in the United States, may be going to college or may be coming right out, who want to start a business and who are being pulled into this direction of socialism or just destruction of American history and tradition? Just very quickly, a message from you given your experience to them. UNANUE: By 2050, the United States Hispanic population will be one-third of the population. So we have before us a past. And we can either take a path of building and loving and producing, being prosperous. That is what my grandfather came, 18 years old from Spain, to the land of opportunity to live the American dream and to prosper. Hispanic businesses are growing at three times the rates of any other business. And so the future is in our hands, and we have the opportunity to either do well or to destroy. And let's do well. INGRAHAM: Socialism or capitalism, freedom or subjugation, it's a pretty obvious choice. But Bob, I just really want to thank you for standing up for what you believe in and your incredible success as a CEO and as a charitable officer of that CEO and everything that you have organized for people in need. It should be held up as an example to the rest of the country. And I want to thank you personally, and I know all our viewers do as well. Thank you so much. UNANUE: I want to thank you, Laura. God bless you. INGRAHAM: All, and up next \"The Ingraham Angle\" gets results? I'll explain. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) INGRAHAM: \"The Ingraham Angle\" gets results. Just look at this week. Tuesday, we brought you details of the outrageous choices parents in Fairfax County, Virginia, were being given about how their kids were going to attend school in the fall. Well, the next day, the county said that it was looking at reducing these restrictions so kids could maybe get a little more in-person instruction. The whole thing is an outrage, but we had an effect. We also asked Secretary of State Mike Pompeo about whether the Chinese app Tiktok would be banned in the U.S. over security concerns. Since that interview, one of the Tiktok's largest influencers has left of the app. What should we be watching out for next week? Let us know your thoughts. That's all the time we have tonight.

To me, that signifies a stealthy handoff of documents or encoded digital communication to get dirt into the hands of reporters. The Trump team is just stabbing Fauci in the front.And they\u2019re doing it by pointing to his past public statements, which are obviously fair game.Behind the scenes, the president hasn\u2019t spoken to Fauci in more than a month.Make no mistake, the president is the decision-maker and Fauci is a medical expert who, by his own account, is not in charge of setting policy. Still, the 79-year-old doctor, who has been part of the government\u2019s infectious disease agency since the Reagan administration, is widely respected, and part of his job is to work on a vaccine.For an administration that has been accused of ignoring science, this seems somewhat petty. But there is an important clash here: Fauci casts himself as a truth-teller, and Trump wants to control the administration\u2019s message, which is that the pandemic is under control and things will be getting better.That, admittedly, is a harder sell when the number of new daily Covid-19 cases surged past 66,000 heading into the weekend, and Florida broke the single-day record for a state on Sunday with more than 15,000 cases. And it comes at a time when the president is pressuring governors, with a threatened funding cutoff, to physically reopen the nation\u2019s schools in September.What the White House has done, among other things, is basically kept Fauci off television. \u201cFace the Nation\u201d host Margaret Brennan told viewers she\u2019s been trying to book him for three months. The coronavirus task force briefings have become infrequent, handed off to Mike Pence and moved out of the White House, and Fauci\u2019s schedule was such that he couldn\u2019t attend the last one.Instead, he\u2019s been doing podcasts and print interviews, such as one in which he told the: \u201cI have a reputation, as you have probably figured out, of speaking the truth at all times and not sugar-coating things. And that may be one of the reasons why I haven\u2019t been on television very much lately.\u201dThe  reports that White House communications aides did approve appearances by Fauci on the PBS \u201cNewsHour,\u201d \u201cMeet the Press\u201d and a CNN town hall. But those were canceled after Fauci did a Facebook Live event with Democratic Sen. Doug Jones and disputed Trump\u2019s assertion that the country\u2019s lower death rate was a sign of progress, calling that a \u201cfalse narrative.\u201d\u201cOur bigger issue with Fauci is stop critiquing the task force .\u2009.\u2009. and try to fix it,\u201d an administration official told the Post.Trump, for his part, has called Fauci \u201ca nice man, but he\u2019s made a lot of mistakes.\u201dWhich brings us to the official counterattack.\u201cSeveral White House officials are concerned about the number of times Dr. Fauci has been wrong on things,\u201d says a statement sent by the White House to reporters.The Post says this \u201cincluded a lengthy list of the scientist\u2019s comments from early in the outbreak. Those included his early doubt that people with no symptoms could play a significant role in spreading the virus...They also point to public reassurances Fauci made in late February, around the time of the first U.S. case of community transmission, that \u201cat this moment, there is no need to change anything that you\u2019re doing on a day-by-day basis.\u201dSure he\u2019s made some missteps, Fauci\u2019s supporters say. But when he downplayed the need for masks early on, it was because he was worried about a shortage and wanted to keep them for health care workers.The , in picking up the story yesterday, said the White House left out Fauci\u2019s words, in an NBC interview, immediately after his \u201cno need to change anything\u201d comment:\u201cRight now the risk is still low, but this could change. When you start to see community spread, this could change and force you to become much more attentive to doing things that would protect you from spread.\u201dAsked yesterday by CNN\u2019s Jim Acosta why the White House was \u201ctrashing\u201d Fauci, press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said the statement came in response to the Post\u2019s questions and the two men \u201chave always had a very good working relationship.\u201dThe president has mentioned Fauci\u2019s high approval ratings. A Times poll last month found that 67 percent of Americans trusted Fauci on Covid-19, while 26 percent trusted Trump.If Fauci was a political appointee, he\u2019d probably have gone the way of Jeff Sessions, Jim Mattis and John Bolton\u00a0by now. But as a career civil servant, he can\u2019t be fired. So the White House is clearly sidelining him instead.It\u2019s a shame the two men, despite their contrasting styles, can\u2019t find a way to work together, as this is a distraction in the war on their common enemy: the virus itself.Footnote: President Trump has retweeted the following missive from game show host Chuck Woolery:\u201cThe most outrageous lies are the ones about Covid 19. Everyone is lying. The CDC, Media, Democrats, our Doctors, not all but most ,that we are told to trust. I think it\u2019s all about the election and keeping the economy from coming back, which is about the election.

And, Biden's top advisor at the time has acknowledged that the Obama administration\u00a0didn't do \"anything right\" to combat that pandemic, before walking back those comments.The record seemingly complicates Biden's claims, in advertising and speeches, that he would have handled state-level coronavirus testing more effectively than the current White House.\"In late July, the CDC abruptly advised states to stop testing for H1N1 flu, and stopped counting individual cases,\" CBS News .\u00a0\"The rationale given for the CDC guidance to forego testing and tracking individual cases was: why waste resources testing for H1N1 flu when the government has already confirmed there's an epidemic?\"Reporter\u00a0Sharyl Attkisson continued: \"Some public health officials privately disagreed with the decision to stop testing and counting, telling CBS News that continued tracking of this new and possibly changing virus was important because H1N1 has a different epidemiology, affects younger people more than seasonal flu and has been shown to have a higher case fatality rate than other flu virus strains.\"CBS News reported that the decision to \"stop counting H1N1 flu cases was made so hastily that states weren't given the opportunity to provide input.\"The Biden campaign did not immediately respond to an after-hours email from Fox News seeking\u00a0comment.According to , \"as 2009 H1N1 cases continued to occur through the spring and summer, the task of counting cases became increasingly difficult.

Once the numbers of cases increased beyond the point where counting of individual cases was practical, on July 23, 2009, CDC reported the number of 2009 cases for the last time.\"Ron Klain, who served as Biden's chief of staff in 2009\u00a0and currently advises him on health matters, :\u00a0\u201cIt is purely a fortuity that this isn\u2019t one of the great mass casualty events in American history.

Within hours of\u00a0\u00a0decision to\u00a0\u00a0travel from China on Jan. 31, Biden and top Democrats immediately derided the move as unnecessary and xenophobic -- and they then beat a hasty retreat from that position as the coronavirus continues to ravage the economy and cause scores of deaths.Biden quickly\u00a0\u00a0what he called Trump's \"record of hysteria, xenophobia\u00a0and fear-mongering\" after the travel restrictions were announced,\u00a0and argued that Trump\u00a0\"is the worst possible person to lead our country through a global health emergency.\" Biden later changed his mind on the travel ban; and he has since said he wasn't talking about the travel ban specifically when he condemned Trump's \"xenophobia.\"Still, Trump's own words concerning coronavirus testing have been used against him in recent days. Trump in a\u00a0rally in Tulsa, Okla., last month\u00a0touted his\u00a0\u00a0response to the coronavirus crisis. As he addressed what he called a \"phenomenal\" job by himself -- an assessment critics dispute\u00a0-- the president lamented that as the nation has increased the availability of coronavirus tests, a higher gross number of tests are coming back positive.\"So I said to my people, slow the testing down, please,\" Trump said.\u00a0\"They test and they test. We had tests that people don't know what's going on. ... We got another one over here. The young man's 10 years old. He's got the sniffles. He'll recover in about 15 minutes. That's a case.\"White House Trade Adviser Peter Navarro said the comments were \"tongue in cheek\"\u00a0on\u00a0.\"Our Coronavirus testing is so much greater (25 million tests) and so much more advanced, that it makes us look like we have more cases, especially proportionally, than other countries,\" Trump tweeted, apparently trying to underscore the serious message behind comments.The comments became their own story out of the whirlwind and controversial rally.\u00a0, for example, ran a story headlined, \"At Tulsa Rally, Trump Suggests U.S. Slow Down Coronavirus Testing to Avoid Bad Statistics.\"But Trump has mentioned in the past that the more people test positive for the coronavirus, the worse it makes the crisis look, despite the fact that experts have said a robust testing system is necessary for the nation to fully get back to normal in the wake of the pandemic.And his administration has been largely behind the push to quickly increase testing capacity in the U.S. as part of what Trump called a \"phenomenal\" response to the crisis.", "comment": "(1,643)", "topic": "Coronavirus", "date": " July 9"}, {"cover": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/07/156/88/Trump-Salute-to-America-AP-1.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "title": "Arthur Herman: If Trump and labor unions team up, 2020 election could be turned upside down", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/trump-and-labor-unions-arthur-herman", "subtitle": "All in all, Democrats in 2020 offer a hard-left agenda that ought to worry workers of every color, creed\u00a0and industry, including those belonging to unions.", "keyword": "U.S.-China trade and COVID-19", "website": "Fox News", "author": "", "content": "Will America\u2019s labor unions be endorsing a  for president this year?If that sounds like a crazy idea, be aware that we are in a political environment, and have a Republican , unlike any other.Last week\u2019s endorsement of Trump by the National Association of Police Officers (NAPO), which had twice endorsed Barack Obama, could open the floodgates of  endorsements that would radically change the electoral equation on Nov. 3, and the future of labor in America.Since the days of FDR, unions like the AFL-CIO and Teamsters have lined up firmly with the Democratic\u00a0Party, while Republicans are generally seen as the tools of big business and enemies of organized labor.Donald Trump is the first Republican president who could decisively reverse that trend.In the end, however, it\u2019s not so much the labor unions who will save Donald Trump.\u00a0It\u2019s Trump who may save the labor unions.Today\u2019s unions find themselves in a precarious position.\u00a0Their share of the American workforce has been steadily falling for decades. Meanwhile, the organized labor spotlight has been taken over by public sector unions like SEIU and NEA, which have a political agenda far to the left of the average AFL-CIO or Teamsters member.Even so, union leaders have tended to stick with Democrats \u2014 that is, until they meet Donald Trump.He\u2019s spent his entire career working with unions in New York; he also speaks \u201cblue-collar\u201d better than any Republican since Abe Lincoln. He came to the presidency blasting the trade deals with China that doomed America\u2019s manufacturing base.\u00a0As president, he renegotiated NAFTA, another union sore point. His trade and manufacturing advisor Peter Navarro is a proven friend of labor, who has advocated restoring our defense industrial base and shipbuilding industry\u2014both strongholds of organized union labor.By comparison, Joe Biden\u2019s record is a political train wreck.\u00a0 Even though candidate Barack Obama enthusiastically courted Big Labor support,\u00a0and Biden likes to pretend he\u2019s got the unions\u2019 back,\u00a0when Obama and Biden ran the White House unions actually lost half a million members.\u00a0Overall, the Obama years saw some 300,000 manufacturing jobs get swept into oblivion \u2014 jobs that, as Obama famously said at a town hall in June 2016, \u201care just not going to come back.\u201d He even scoffed that Donald Trump would need a \u201cmagic wand\u201d to make that happen.Well, Trump found that wand.A 2018 Texas Public Policy Foundation study found that compared to the last 21 months of the Obama administration, the first 21 months of the Trump presidency boosted manufacturing employment by 3.1 percent\u00a0\u2014\u00a0meaning that ten times more manufacturing jobs were added under Trump, compared to the Obama-Biden years.Of course, labor unions still show declining membership, which is at its lowest ebb since 1983\u2014while the onset of COVID-19 and the Great Lockdown has put paid to much of that manufacturing surge.Still, a second Trump term bolstered by union support would mean an economic resurgence geared toward those industries where union members are crucial, from our defense industrial base to infrastructure projects.By contrast, a Biden presidency promises labor only more unemployment checks, especially in the energy industry which is a specific target of Rep. Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s Green New Deal. According to a study by the National Ocean Industries Association, Biden\u2019s offshore drilling ban alone could cost 200,000 or more jobs.\u00a0 Even worse, the radical turn among Democrats has fomented violence in the streets and sustained attacks on police departments and America\u2019s heritage, as well as imposing a state-by-state lockdown to cripple Trump\u2019s economic rebound.All in all, Democrats in 2020 offer a hard-left agenda that ought to worry workers of every color, creed\u00a0and industry, including those belonging to unions.It\u2019s not too late for Trump to seek out union support for major portions of his agenda, from reshoring manufacturing and decoupling from China to basic law and order issues.The question is, whether the unions realize that their future may also be at stake in November, not to mention the country\u2019s.", "comment": "(483)", "topic": "OPINION", "date": " July 21"}, {"cover": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/07/156/88/Dan-Gelber-No-Alcohol-Sign.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "title": "Miami Beach mayor wants to ban alcohol sales after midnight, rebrand city's party scene", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/us/miami-beach-mayor-midnight-alcohol-ban-rebrand-party-scene", "subtitle": "Mayor Dan Gelber, D-Fla., is taking drastic steps to clean up Miami Beach, and it could include the restriction of alcohol sales after midnight.", "keyword": "U.S.-China trade and COVID-19", "website": "Fox News", "author": "Cortney Moore", "content": "Mayor Dan Gelber, D-Fla., is taking drastic steps to clean up , and it could include the restriction of  sales after midnight.The new measure is all a part of the 59-year-old mayor\u2019s rebranding proposal, which aims to turn South Beach into an  rather than a party destination. If the City Commission approves of the plan, bars would have to start their last call for alcohol at 12 a.m. versus the current 5 a.m. the entertainment district has. establishments that wish to serve alcohol after this designated time would need to submit an application for extended alcohol sales to the Beverage Control Board. Venues that get approval for an alcohol extension would then have to adhere to additional requirements such as paid on-site police, having codes of conduct or agreements to not host promoted parties, according to the proposal.The Beverage Control Board would also have the power to revoke extensions if needed.Grocery and convenience stores that serve packaged alcohol would be required to cut off sales earlier, as well -- at 5 p.m. instead of the current 8 p.m.The\u00a0new alcohol measures Gelber is hoping to pass are meant to curb the \u201cmisbehavior\u201d that stems from heavy drinking, he explained in a\u00a0YouTube video posted Tuesday. He added that alcohol has been tied to high crime rates against South Beach visitors.In his own words, Gelber said the city is a \u201cvictim of its own success\u201d and compared the area to a \u201cbeachfront Bourbon Street\u201d -- the lively nightlife strip New Orleans is largely known for.\u201cWorst of all, it is not the brand we have fostered elsewhere in our city and not one we should tolerate,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we will no longer have an entertainment district, we will have an art deco cultural district or some similar name that reflects our city\u2019s status as a true art and cultural destination.\u201dThe Democrat\u00a0mayor noted that he had previously tried to fix the entertainment district by toning it down with issued standards of conduct for caf\u00e9 table permits, passed ordinances to stop party promotions during high-impact weekends, eliminated noise exemptions that contributed to a rowdy atmosphere and enhanced law enforcement practices for policing the area. Additionally, his administration had launched counter-programming to control South Beach and bring down crime.However, Gelber said these efforts have not been enough to bring down the \u201craucous dynamic of our entertainment district.\u201dMiami attracted 24.2 million visitors in 2019, which brought in $17.9 billion to the local economy, according to a 2019 Visitor Industry Overview report from the .In the same report, a visitor survey showed that only three percent of domestic and international travelers cited nightlife, bars and clubs as the \u201cmost liked\u201d part of their trip.", "comment": "(155)", "topic": "Florida", "date": " July 22"}, {"cover": "https://a57.foxnews.com/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/694940094001/717e6dc8-1bab-42d1-abb7-01984cd08333/8476f472-a4dc-49b6-8e69-218c35b8f340/1280x720/match/156/88/image.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "title": "Christian Whiton: Trump's reelection prospects \u2014 7 reasons why he'll likely see a second term", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/christian-whiton-trumps-reelection-prospects-7-reasons-why-hell-likely-see-a-second-term", "subtitle": "Left-wing pundits are confidently predicting the Trump defeat for which they have lusted, but they are likely wrong.", "keyword": "U.S.-China trade and COVID-19", "website": "Fox News", "author": "", "content": "You\u2019ve seen the crowing by left-wing pundits.

Many were wrong in 2016,\u00a0and they will likely\u00a0be proven\u00a0wrong again. In any given poll, all it takes to skew results is a few respondents who don\u2019t want to tell a stranger on the phone that they  Trump. This dynamic is likely greater now than in 2016 given the McCarthyite atmosphere progressives have created in which supporting Trump can be hazardous to one\u2019s social standing, career\u00a0and even physical safety., the presidential campaign hasn\u2019t really started yet. This may come as news to people who follow politics and for whom it seems the 2016 campaign never really ended. But most Americans simply don\u2019t pay serious attention to the campaign until after Labor Day., the biggest issue in the campaign will be jobs and economy. Biden and most other Democrats are on the side of keeping the economy and schools closed. He has also endorsed massive tax hikes, which most voters understand will kills jobs and the economic recovery.Trump, in contrast, has urged reopening businesses and schools and arranged for the mass production of coronavirus vaccines so they are available right when they are approved, hopefully beginning in October. Plus Trump, unlike Biden, already has one economic boom under his belt., the new coalition Trump assembled in 2016 remains intact. His breakthrough was attracting lower-income voters who previously voted Democrat but felt betrayed by the elite. He also energized conservatives with promises to appoint constitutionalist judges.As a result, Trump flipped traditionally Democratic Pennsylvania, Michigan\u00a0and Wisconsin to the Republican column and held swing states like Ohio and Florida. No part of the this coalition has soured on Trump. Democrat-run cities in chaos may also help him win back the suburbs., Trump is tough on China and Biden is not. Americans are well aware that the virus that has cut short nearly 150,000 American lives came from China, abetted by the malfeasance of the ruling Chinese Communist Party. Trump has raised tariffs on more than half of goods from China and reoriented the U.S. military to deter China as its primary mission.Joe Biden was second in command of an administration that appeased China and mistreated key allies like Taiwan. He opposes Trump\u2019s tariffs on China. His son mysteriously raised large sums of money from China and Biden himself was the chief advocate of letting China in to the World Trade Organization \u2014\u00a0the key enabling step of robbing America of industry and crushing the middle class., the Trump campaign organization finally has its game on. A rule of thumb is that campaigns run by wannabe celebrity managers are likely to lose. By installing Bill Stepien as campaign manager last week, Trump has the opposite of this type of person running his reelection effort. The campaign is ahead of Biden in fundraising, and just this week raised an unprecedented $20 million in a single virtual event that drew 300,000 donors who gave an average of $67.Biden remains largely sequestered in his basement, avoiding most media. The Democrats have all but canceled their convention, opting for a mostly digital confab. In contrast, Trump will accept his party\u2019s nomination on Aug.\u00a027\u00a0before thousands of cheering Republican delegates in Jacksonville, Fla., marking the real beginning of the campaign and a likely string of high energy rallies.Biden, whose campaign and debate performances were pathetic before panicked Democrats coalesced behind him to deprive Bernie Sanders of the nomination, cannot match this performance., the Democrats have gone nuts. While the media loves to spotlight any disapproval of Trump by a fellow Republican, the real political crisis in America in on the Left. Centrist, economic liberals are being shouted down and defeated in primaries by far-left woke activists who support the Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez wing of the party and cancel culture.The British Labour Party underwent a similar transformation to the woke Left before being nearly annihilated at polls last December. Americans aren\u2019t any more likely than Brits to want to be governed by elitists who in our country falsely accuse them of racism, side with the Antifa-Black Lives Matter mob against cops, and nod at those attempting to censor or fire Americans who defend meritocracy against the racial obsession and cancel culture that now dominates the Left.Lacking moral courage, many congressional Republicans have been slow to defend against this threat to freedom. Trump doesn\u2019t have that problem, and since his July 3rd speech at Mount Rushmore, in which he defended American history, has made it clear he is the bodyguard Americans need to stop the woke mob.As in 2016, Donald Trump in 2020 and the political and economic factors afoot defy conventional analysis.

We have a big announcement coming tonight.And, by the way, we also want you to call all your Democratic friends right now, ask them to learn the real, ugly truth about Joe Biden. Joe Biden hit a new low today and also confusing moments again. We will expose the entire truth that the mob will never tell you.Joe, it's time we give America a history lesson about you. That's coming tonight.But first, we start with the carnage in Chicago, chaos in Portland, violent crime surging in nearly every major city in America. Democratic mayors, Democratic governors, they have failed in their most basic duty, and that is the most basic responsibility, to maintain law and order. They have failed and people are dying and being shot as a result.They have failed to keep their neighborhood safe. They have failed to prevent violent crime. As a result, men, women and children are dying. Our fellow Americans are dying.These mayors are literally twiddling their thumbs and playing politics. Philadelphia's top prosecutor is now vowing to arrest any federal law enforcement agents that are sent to the city.But President Trump is taking action. Today in a major press conference, he announced the expansion of what's called Operation LeGend. That's a federal program. It started in Kansas City and was named after a 4-year-old boy who was killed by gunfire while asleep in his own bed.Well, they'll now send more than 100 federal officers to Chicago, 35 to Albuquerque without having a problem in order to help take violent criminals off of the streets. The mayors aren't doing it. The governors aren't doing it.Listen to the president.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: The citizens of Chicago are citizens of America and they have the same right as every other American to live in safety, dignity and peace. No mother should ever have to cradle her dead child in her arms simply because politicians refused to do what is necessary to secure their neighborhood and to secure their city.Every American, no matter their income, race, or their zip code, should be able to walk the city streets free from violence and free from fear.For this reason today, I am announcing the Department of Justice will immediately surge federal law enforcement to the city of Chicago. The FBI, ATF, DEA, U.S. Marshals Service and Homeland Security will together be sending hundreds of skilled law enforcement officers to Chicago to help drive down violent crime.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: Safety, security is the foundation for our great American dream. Every child, every neighborhood, every city deserves to be safe. You can't climb the ladder of opportunity without security and safety.This president committed to making serious progress all over the country.Let's go back to his conference earlier today.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: My vision for America's cities could not be more different from the lawlessness being pushed by the extreme radical left. While others want to defund, defame, and abolish the police, I want to support and honor our great police.We want to build factories in Baltimore, not Beijing. We want to make our products in Chicago, not Shanghai. We want the American dream for American children, and I will fight to deliver that dream every ounce -- every single ounce of my strength, I will be fighting.But opportunity cannot thrive where there's violence, prosperity cannot flourish where there's bloodshed, and security cannot exist where there are violent criminals who are able to maim and murder with impunity. That is what Operation Legend is all about.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: \"Operation Legend\" is a beginning. It's greatly needed in all of these cities.Now, 100 agents, they cannot save and protect these cities. They can't. They can protect, well, federal property, they can help in investigations, they can get to underlying groups that are fomenting this violence.But unless and until these reckless, irresponsible Democratic mayors and governors do their job and/or allow the help they are being offered, they are allowing innocent people to die. That is all on them. New York, Chicago, Philly, Baltimore, you name the city, Seattle, Portland, it's all on them.Especially true in Chicago. Shootings were up 47 percent over last year, homicides up by a whopping 51 percent, 70 shot last weekend, 63 the weekend before, even children dying every single week. The violence reaches catastrophic levels.By the way, last night, we reported on that horrific mass shooting in the south side of Chicago. Fifteen people seriously wounded outside of a funeral home in what appears to be a gun-related incident. At least 60 shell casings recovered from the scene, caught on camera by nearby surveillance system.Take a look.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)(GUNSHOTS)(SCREAMING)(GUNSHOTS)(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: Mayor Lightweight isn't doing anything to protect her city.Moments later, two visibly shaken witnesses compared it to a war zone, as the president has been calling this and applauded the president's plan, please help us. Please send in.Well, the mayor and the governor won't let him do that. Take a look.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We wish it would stop. And we're glad the federal troops are here in Chicago because the violence is literally just as bad as it was as the Pandora, the Pandoran (INAUDIBLE). So, I mean, we need more cops and federal troops, because there's literally like we're in Iraq or something.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes, it feels like, we're -- at a war, in a war.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: As this devastating scene unfolding, sadly, typical night, Chicago's Mayor Lori Lightfoot who is a lightweight in terms of protecting people, busy on Twitter. What was she doing? Bashing President Trump, tweeting: Under no circumstances will I allow Donald Trump's troops to come to Chicago and terrorize our residents.She clearly hates the president more than she cares about innocent men, women and children in her city. Rahm \"Dead Fish\" Emanuel, he didn't do anything either. Barack Obama's president, barely mentioned Chicago, 1,000 shot, 1,000 died. Biden did nothing.At that point, when will these liberal mayors and governors, when do we hold them accountable for not protecting innocent people? Hundreds of people shot every week in Chicago and a lot of the cities. Six small children have been killed in July alone.Last night, a 3-year-old little girl was shot in the head, but the mayor is worried about troops terrorizing her city. Really? Now, what has she done to stop the violence? What has she done to save lives?Lightfoot who is a lightweight on protecting citizens seems more worried about optics and politics than the men, women and children that she is supposed to protect and serve. It's a national disgrace.She is not the only Democrat putting politics before human life. In Portland, we see the same thing. Democrats there, they're apoplectic. The federal agents were trying to protect federal buildings from being burned to the ground. That is their right and their job.Portland's mayor calling the federal officers, literally, the officers, not the anarchist, not the people involved in the violence, calling the officers un-American.Oregon's stupid governor floating an insane conspiracy theory that they were abducting people.Pelosi, get this, comparing agents, law enforcement agents who put their lives on the line to protect and serve \"stormtroopers\".Congressman Clyburn, the leadership in the Democratic Party, referring to them as Nazi Gestapo.Meanwhile, corrupt and confused Joe Biden, he's not said a single positive word about law enforcement, the 99th percent, since running for president. He accused federal agents of, quote, brutally attacking peaceful protesters.Now, we have also heard him say that police have become the enemy and he supports the defund effort or as he calls it, we will reallocate sources. He likes that word better.Let's be clear -- anarchist, vandals, have been writing nearly two straight months in downtown Portland. They firebombed the federal courthouse twice. They possibly, permanently blinded federal officers with lasers. Dozens of buildings have been vandalized, lit ablaze.Businesses, they're shutdown. People don't feel safe. These are not peaceful protests, Joe.And here's just a small example of what law enforcement is facing. Take a look.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)(CHANTING)(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: Wait until you see all of the video with Ami Horowitz who's on the ground in Portland as we speak. There have been more than 50 straight days of violent demonstrations in the city's downtown district.Remember, according to Biden, federal law enforcement officials were the real enemy here. See what's happening? Biden doesn't have a plan to stop violence, make America cities safer to protect innocent people so he just trashes Donald Trump.Now, he's even deploying one of the old Democratic Party favorite tactics. He is now playing the race card. I pointed out and I've done this history so many times come, every two years, every four years, like clockwork. Republicans, they are racist, sexists, misogynistic, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamophobic, they want dirty air and water. They want grandma and grandpa to eat dog food, cat food, before Paul Ryan or a Republican Trump look-alike throws granny over a cliff in a wheelchair.And, today, Biden accusing Trump, the president, of being the first racist president in history. Get ready for \"Hannity\" history real lesson in a second.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOE BIDEN, D-PRESUMPTIVE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: You have racists, they've existed and they tried to get elected president. He's the first one that has. And the way he pits people against one another is all designed to divide the country.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: Put y'all back in chains.All right. Now, it's time for a \"Hannity\" history lesson. Forget the fact that Democrats have accused every Republican of being racist. We've gone over -- 1998 radio ad in Missouri, the 2000 James Byrd ad, Al Gore, Republicans don't even want to count you in the census. They will put y'all back in chains.Let's go over the facts. Here's Joe Biden's history.It was Donald Trump, not Joe and not Barack who passed criminal justice reform and prison reform. It was Donald Trump, it wasn't Joe and it was not Barack who signed off on police reform. It was Donald Trump also doing opportunity zones, targeting mostly minority neighborhoods to help -- well, build the economies in neighborhoods that have been left behind by Joe and Barack.It was President Trump, not Joe, not Barack, who ushered in record low after record low after record low unemployment for African-Americans, Hispanic-Americans, Asian-Americans, women in the workplace, youth unemployment, African-American youth unemployment. Joe and Barack, they didn't do any of that.As a matter of fact, 13 million more Americans in food stamps, 8 million more in poverty, lowest labor participation rate in, oh, since the \u201870s. Had a 51-year low in homeownership rate, and the worst recovery since the '40s. That's their eight years of failure.And, by the way, three years in, President Trump has done more for minorities in this country than Joe Biden, Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer did in 125 years.Watch this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: You look at employment, you look at opportunity zones and maybe most importantly, you look at criminal justice reform. You look at prison reform. I've done things that nobody else -- and I've said this and I say it openly, and not a lot of people dispute it, I've done more for black Americans than anybody with the possible exception of Abraham Lincoln. Nobody has even been close.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: The media mob, the biggest contributor to the Biden campaign and all things radical, extreme Democratic socialist, they'll never tell you that.So, you need to ask yourself the question, what was Biden doing during his 50-plus year career in the swamp for African-Americans, other minorities?Here is where it gets interesting. All -- tell all your Democratic friends, we know he was very close and spoke so highly of the former Klansman Robert KKK Byrd, yes, former Klan leader. Biden called the Byrd the dean of the U.S. Senate, a close friend of mine and a mentor. That man filibustered the Civil Rights Act of 1964, that, well, Lyndon Johnson needed 80 percent of Republicans in the House and Senate to get past and most Democrats are opposing it.During a speech, Joe Biden in 1973 praised Democrats in a two-party system in the South that is called, well I'm a good for the -- I won't use the word.Around the same time, Biden was actively working with the segregationists. He didn't want immigration. He opposed school busing. According to NBC News, he led the charge on an initiative to keep black students away from the black students away from white students. That is his record.In \u201877, Biden worried his children, his children, if integration -- would grow up in a, quote, racial jungle if integration is not done in an orderly way, whatever the hell that means.1993, referred to inner-city youth as predators on our streets as he coauthored the most aggressive crime bill that ramped up prison sentences for dozens of crimes specifically targeting in the end minority Americans.In 2006, telling a crowd, well, you have to have a slight Indian accent to work out at 7-Eleven or Dunkin Donuts. I'm not kidding he said.2006, he bragged his state was a slave state.2007, yes, he actually said this about Barack Obama: the first, OK, the first mainstream African-American who is articulate, bright, clean, that story book, man. Wow.Last year, he said, poor kids could be just as bright as white kids. And recently, you ain't black if you don't support Donald Trump. Joe decides that?Joe Biden shouldn't throw stones from that glass house. That mob in the media will never tell you. Better yet, he could just stop saying racist things altogether. Joe, take a look in the mirror.When is anybody in the mob and the media going to ask him about any of these things? Because that's the truth, that's the history. And, by the way, actually knows if Joe Biden can even form a answer to any of these questions.We're going to play his very latest struggles in a moment. It's not good.Joining us now with reaction, FOX News contributor Dan Bongino, Fox News correspondent-at-large, Geraldo Rivera, civil rights attorney, Leo Terrell, Leo 2.0.All right, Leo, let's play a game here except it's not a game because lives matter, right? Let's not play games.LEO TERRELL, CIVIL RIGHTS LAWYER: Yes.HANNITY: Donald Trump set record low after record low unemployment, opportunity zones, the largest and most expensive of long-term commitment to historically black colleges in America -- Joe didn't do that. Criminal justice reform, Joe and Barack didn't do that. Police reform, Joe and Barack didn't do that.So, you tell me, if Donald Trump said the things I just laid out that Biden said, how would African-Americans and how would the media treat Donald Trump?TERRELL: They -- they would simply annihilate him. Let me be very clear to every Democrat on the planet, Donnell J. Trump has done more for black America in three years than the Biden/Obama administration.The reason why I'm here right now, the reason I'm voting for Donald Trump is because Joe Biden went on national radio and said, if you're -- if you vote for Trump, you ain't black. That is insulting. That is racist! Biden is the racist.And what is amazing is, you think you have another dinosaur, Jim Clyburn, who uses terms like Nazis, and Gestapo, he needs to retire. That is insulting to the people who suffer during the holocaust. So you have these old outdated Democrats who are still trying to pander to blacks. Blacks reject this. And with the crime going on in these Democratic cities, it is insulting.Donald Trump is the only person who can resurrect these Democratic cities and save them from lawlessness.But let's be very clear: Joe Biden is a racist, not Donald Trump.HANNITY: OK, Geraldo Rivera, I know how you feel about underprivileged in America, kids of all races. You got a heart of gold. One thing I will say about Geraldo, Dan Bongino knows it, Leo knows it, I know it, heart of gold.Donald Trump said those things, Geraldo, how different would it be in the media today?GERALDO RIVERA, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT-AT-LARGE: Oh, please, they would blow him up. It would be impossible for him to continue it. He's not a racist. I've known him 45 years.Having said that, I don't like that kung flu thing. I wish he would stop that. I think he has.I think there is some sloppy stuff, you know, in recent years that I don't like, but I know him. I know I've been in and out of that Trump Tower 50 times. It is as integrated as any building in this country. He gives opportunity on the basis of competence. Not skin color.And for Biden to say he is the first racist ever elected, that shows how disconnected Joe Biden is. 12 United States presidents were slaveholders. Joe should do a little research before he makes flamboyant charge like that, so unhinged from reality. Nixon, LBJ used language far more salty and you would argue, in today's standards, racist.This man is a good-hearted man and I really do believe that in terms of the economic opportunity zones and the criminal justice reform, he really has done more than any recent president for integration and the advancement of everybody regardless of their race, color, religion. You know that, Sean.HANNITY: And, Dan, this is what it comes down to too -- slogans, bumper stickers, symbolism. I'll take the substance. I'll take the jobs. I'll take the opportunity zones. I will take the money for historically black colleges.I'll take the results over the rhetoric. Every two years, every four years, Dan Bongino, Republicans are racist, sexist, my whole list.BONGINO: Yeah. Yeah, you want a talker or you want a doer? You want a guy who built stuff, you want a guy who talks about building stuff.You know, Sean, the greatest political scam in the last 50 years has been the media perpetrating the myth and falsehood that the Democrat Party is on the side of the minority community. This is ridiculous.Do you know how many people, by the way, through op-ed columns and elsewhere were whispering in the president's ear? Man, you know, leave Chicago alone. Leave it alone. Let them suffer the ramifications of their own bad decision-making with the leaders.You know how easy of a decision that could have been for him? And he didn't. And I was proud of him today, Sean. He came in there and said, no, not on my watch.And, you know, as I was preparing for the segment earlier, Sean, it's not a joke. I wanted to follow-up on a 3-year-old girl who was shot in the face in Chicago. So, I Googled it. It's on my phone.And it's right there. It turns out you have to go through which 3-year-old girl? Because there's not just one.Sean, if this was happening in Darfur, we'd have the embassy working 24 hours a day, 3-year-olds being shot in the face, I'm not kidding, Google 3- year-old shot in Chicago and you have to find the right one.HANNITY: Unbelievable.BONGINO: Thank God president Trump has the cojones to go in there and do the right thing and say not on my watch.HANNITY: Protecting federal buildings and 100 federal officers unless the governors and mayors do their job or at least request the help needed. The president -- he can't take responsibility for their failures.Last word --TERRELL: You know, one other comment, one other comment. The president wants to do more for America and people of color. Tim Scott, justice reform bill, guess what, two black Democrats, Booker and Harris stopped it. The Democrats are blocking justice in this country because they don't want Trump to succeed. It's crazy.HANNITY: Last word quick, Geraldo.RIVERA: But I don't understand, Sean, why there aren't more arrests in Portland. Those federal officers are taking abuse that is criminal. It is literally felonious assault.When you shine a laser in the eyes of a cop and his eyes are permanently damaged as a result, that's an assault, a felonious assault. These people should be arrested.And Mayor Wheeler and those other local hacks be damned. It's time for the feds to -- if a crime is committed in front of them, grab those people in charge them with arson. Charge them with whatever the crime is. They were being caught on tape. We're watching it every night.What is it now, almost 60 days? It's preposterous!HANNITY: Well, speaking of which, thank you all as always.Now, speaking of the war zone in Portland, Ami Horowitz was in the middle of that shift, the Adam Schiff show, horrible chaos, horrible violence. He was put in danger. We've got that exclusive video coming up next. A hundred and four days out of an election, Karl Rove, Senator John Kennedy, and a really big announcement.Stay with us.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)HANNITY: All right. The chaos continues in Portland.Last night, filmmaker, documentarian Ami Horowitz was in the city, captured these disturbing videos. Take a look.(VIDEO CLIP PLAYS)HANNITY: More on the collapse of another liberal city, law and order gone. Well, he's in Portland tonight, filmmaker Ami Horowitz.Describe what you saw last night especially as it relates to what they were doing to the police and to other areas?AMI HOROWITZ, FILMMAKER: Yeah, total chaos, Sean. Basically what is going on is you have in Portland at 9:00, you have a four square block radius around the federal court building in Portland that is taken over by protesters. Last night when I was there, going back tonight, there was about 5,000 people there who are protesting.But I've got to -- we've got to be clear what I mean by protesters. One of the -- the great stories about what is going on, not just in Portland but about the protest in general is the malpractice how these people are portrayed, how people view them in the media. They're saying it's all kumbaya, brother. They are just sitting there having a great time, and they're cooking out, and they've got people singing and dancing.And the reality is, you have hundreds of people attacked this federal building. I mean attacked. I mean, they had hammers, and steel pipes and were setting fires to burn the building down, and all the old people in it. While the, quote-unquote, peaceful protesters are exhorting them off, cheering them on, OK?These people are aghast to what was happening. These were not people who were saying, hey, guys, you shouldn't be doing this. They were supporting these people who are trying to burn these officers alive in the federal building.So, to say that they're -- it's emotionally peaceful protest, it's -- it's a load of crap. It's not true at all. They are part of the problem and a part of the violence.HANNITY: And you're going to go out again tonight. We'll have more video tomorrow, I assume. I hope I'm wrong. I hope there is no more video tomorrow, but I guess that's impossible.All right. Ami Horowitz, thank you.Today, comrade Bill de Blasio continued his denial New York City is experiencing extremely dangerous crime wave on his watch. He is threatening to sue President Trump. OK, if he sends in the feds. Philadelphia has been talked that they'll arrest troops. Meaning people there to protect the city and protect federal property. Wow, this is how sick it's gotten.Take a look.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MAYOR BILL DE BLASIO, D-N.Y.: I want to be very, very clear that we will not allow this to happen in our city. And this could only make things worse and I have sent this letter today to the attorney general and to the acting homeland secure -- homeland security secretary, making clear, formally, that the presence of these federal officials, these federal officers is not welcome here in New York City and is not needed here.We will not be intimidated. And if we see these federal officers on our streets, then we will see the Trump administration in court.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: Ooh, so scary.That guy right there, he is the dumbest mayor in the country. Even New York Governor Cuomo admitted Trump's concerns, the president's concerns about crime in our nation's capital and New York City, the largest city in the country, are well-founded. Take a look.(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)GOV. ANDREW CUOMO, D-N.Y.: Look, the president's concerns about New York City where well-founded. There are issues in New York City. You put COVID on top of the unrest after the George Floyd murder, et cetera, there's been an increase in crime. So I get the concerns, but I don't believe federal troops are the answer.(END AUDIO CLIP)HANNITY: He's not doing anything either. Philadelphia's top prosecutor saying that he's going to arrest any federal law enforcement agents sent to the city.Joining us now, author of the upcoming book \"Firebrand\", Congressman Matt Gaetz, former NYPD commissioner Bernie Kerik.Bernie, we know how to save cities. You did it, you and Rudy Giuliani. You went from about 2,500 murders a year, it got down as low as 300.BERNARD KERIK, FORMER NYPD COMMISSIONER: Sean, listen, Mayor -- Mayor Bill de Blasio is an idiot. And the reason I say he's an idiot is because we already have federal agents combined with the NYPD in every capacity. We have the FBI Joint Terrorist Task Force. We have the DEA task force. We have a number of bank robbery federal task force. They're already here.Here's the issue: the president has to up the numbers. That's what he has to do. There is already agreements in place between the NYPD and the federal government for these agents to be here. If he ups those numbers and we focus on gangs, guns and drugs, we can annihilate the rule of thugs.So, I know the mayor wants to talk about troops, we're not talking about troops. We're talking about special agents from the FBI, the DEA, ATF, and other federal agents that are already here. They already work here.I was in the DEA task force. He has no idea what he's talking about.HANNITY: You know, Matt Gaetz, you see this unfolding around the country. My attitude is very simple.Now, Bernie Kerik is right. We do have federal agents in big cities. OK, protecting federal courthouses and federal buildings. They have not only a right, an obligation to do so.But unless and until these liberal mayors, liberal governors are willing to do their job, and are rejecting the president's help, this is on them. That's their problem. All the president can do is offer to help.And I will tell you, the rejection is resulting in lost of life. This is not a game anymore.REP. MATT GAETZ, R-FLA.: America is a great nation and a great nation does not allow her cities to fall victim to the angry mob. The victims in these cases of violence, who see their businesses destroyed, their churches burned, sometimes even their lives lost and the lives lost of their children. They're not just Seattleites or Portlanders, or New Yorkers, they're Americans.And you're right. Secretary Chad Wolf said that if we didn't have federal troops there, the federal courthouses, the federal buildings would literally fall. And so, President Trump doesn't just have a legal obligation, he has a moral obligation to act.And our nation is stronger than this mob. I'm glad that President Trump is going to prove it. And these municipal leaders who have been feckless and cowardly, they will be exposed for what they are.HANNITY: By the way, Matt Gaetz can announce he's going to run for president in 2028. I just -- I've been hearing rumors all day about that. I'm teasing.You know, Bernie Kerik, the thing is that if they're going to turn federal agents into the enemy, and their attitude is get out of town, clean up the graffiti before you go, I don't think the president ought to take that step because at that point, now he is not only fighting the anarchist who will be encouraged by these reckless, irresponsible failed mayors and governors.KERIK: You know what, Sean? There was something really bothering me, this starts in Portland. You know, that mayor and the governor of Oregon, they're talking about all that stuff about, you shouldn't be there, the troop shouldn't be there, they shouldn't be, you know, harassing the protesters so to speak.I honestly think the FBI should be looking at these people. You cannot tell me that they're intentionally, they're not intentionally forcing the police not to go out and take out these protesters that are trying to burn down federal courthouses.HANNITY: Do you want to make your announcement tonight, Matt Gaetz?GAETZ: The only announcement I have is I've got a book \"Firebrand\" available for preorder on Amazon. And you know what? Joe Biden --HANNITY: I'm now endorsing it.GAETZ: -- he doesn't give a damn about these cities. If he did, he'd have done something about it when he was vice president.HANNITY: Yes. By the way, congratulations.One day, I want to tell a story about Matt, about what a great human being he is and how he's literally changed somebody's life for the better in a dramatic way. But I'm not going to do that story tonight.GAETZ: Thank you, Sean.HANNITY: All right. I mean it.All right. Quick break, Joe Biden, more blunders. I mean, it's a disaster. They're actually stopping interviews because he can't continue. We'll play you the tape. The architect Karl Rove joins us.Also, Senator John Kennedy here and our big announcement, all coming up. Thanks for being with us.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)HANNITY: So remember last week, barely there Joe Biden thought the state of Arizona's wonderful city. Another awkward moment today in his media blitz, including another interview cut short by one of his handlers because he can't handle it.Take a look.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOE BIDEN, D-PRESUMPTIVE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: I'm sorry. I'm confused too I am talking to here. But anyway, whoever it is.And I had nurse at the -- nurses at the Walter Reed Hospital who would been down and whisper in my ear to go home and get me pillows. They would make sure they'd actually probably never anything taught in -- you can't do it during the COVID time, but they would actually breathe in my nostrils to make me move.Wearing a mask now, this is a political statement? This is more patriotic. Why do you wear the mask? So you don't make somebody else sick. Sick.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I want to ask --BIDEN: What is with this guy?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Steve, that's our time.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: OK.All right. Thanks (ph) for your time.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: Time is up.If anyone can interpret that mess, go right ahead.Now, be honest, he was tired. It was time for his nappy.Anyway, beyond Biden's blunders, the constant -- the contrast between the president, his vision, his anima, strength, his mental alertness and his passion for American prosperity versus quid pro quo Joe's -- well, his vision, pleas to the enemy, Bernie Sanders, Bolshevik Bernie's economic plans, AOC, yeah, her New Green Deal plan, Beto Bozo O'Rourke's compensation of guns plan, and Pelosi and Schumer. Wow, a vote for Biden is a vote for Bernie and every extreme radical socialist agenda item ever proposed.Law, order, peace, prosperity, security, safety, it's all on the ballot in just 104 days where you become the ultimate jury.Joining us now to break it all down, FOX News contributor, we call him the architect, Karl Rove.All right, Karl, I need an interpreter. Can you interpret what that is? And they just fade to black now. Joe's losing it, sorry. We are out of time. Beep. You are out.KARL ROVE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Yes, mystifying. I was taken this week with his appearance on Joy Reid's new MSNBC program. He was her inaugural guest. She immediately gives him a chance, says, what do you think of President Trump's handling of the coronavirus? He begins to pummel him for a few moments.So, she then -- which she lets him go, that's what she wants him to do, and then she turns to him and says, well, look, you know, if you're elected, then the pandemics probably is still raging. So walk us through, she says, walk us what you would do differently next year.He then makes seven statements. Every one of the recommendations that he is going to do next year is already being done. He says, I've been talking about the Defense Production Act. Well, President Trump used that in March. He says, we need to have everybody wear masks. Well, the CDC and the White House Coronavirus Task Force recommended that months ago.He said, you know, we need to make sure the businesses continue to be able to stay alive. Well, that's called the CARES Act and it has over 800, nearly $900 billion in forgivable loans to small businesses.We need to make certain nobody, he says, who has COVID, gets -- has to pay for it. Well, the president already did that months ago.And he says, we need to have somebody in command right now in order to oversee the production and distribution of the vaccine. Well, that person is already in place. It is a general who is the head of the Army military command -- materials command and President Trump appointed him May 15th to do exactly that job. He says, and we need to spend $25 billion to do it.Well, Congress appropriated $10 million and the Department of Human and Health Services has found billions more and they're spending it. If they need more they're going to get more from Congress. But, I mean, here it is, he's given a great opportunity to tell us what you would do differently and all seven things that he lays out are things that the administration has exactly done.Can't the guy come up with one new idea, one -- just one, just one new idea? That'd be all we'd ask for.HANNITY: You know, he's also against the travel ban ten days after the first identified case. He's also against the subsequent travel ban, also against the quarantines. Countless, hundreds of thousands of Americans did not attract the virus because of it. It gave us time to kill the PPE that we needed and the ventilators.And Donald Trump did all that and he did it against the recommendations of many. Those three decisions right there he was against. And they saved lives.ROVE: Yes, we've seen Biden before. We've seen him a lot of places. We have had an emergency in our town and somebody says, you know, if I had been in charge, here is what I would have done. Or a big controversy, you know, if I had been the guy in charge, let me tell you, I would do it differently.And they can't do it. Just go look at and better yet read my column tomorrow morning where I lay it out what he says and what was already done. It's just amazing to me. Is this the best the guy can do? I mean, I think what is happening in the basement is he's gotten lazy, mentally lazy. And so, he thinks he can get away with this because he goes on places like Joy Reid and he doesn't get challenged.Let him get in front of a real journalist and see how he handles it. What if somebody said wait a minute, those things that have been done, I ask you, what differently you would do? You haven't suggested anything different. And let's see how he'd answer that. But he's getting away with murder right now, and it is getting to be a mistake for him because he can't keep this up for the 104 days up in the campaign.HANNITY: Would he get away, Karl, would he get away with trying to duck debates?ROVE: No, if he, if he or President Trump said, I'm not showing up at the debates, they will go down. There's no doubt about it. The American people expect him to show up for three debates.The president -- you know, the president has got to be careful because Biden did take care of Paul Ryan and took care of Sarah Palin and the vice presidential debate in '08 and '12. But he's got to show up for \u2018em, and that's going to be a real -- I think the climactic moment of this campaign. The debates are more important than they've ever been since at least 1980.HANNITY: All right. The architect, Karl Rove, thank you.When we come back, important information, tough action the president is taking on China. You won't believe what they did.And, by the way, John Kennedy reacts. That means he's going to have a lot of fun things to say and our big announcement, straight ahead.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)HANNITY: Breaking news today, the Chinese government threatened retaliation on Wednesday after the U.S. ordered the Chinese closed a consulate in Houston, Texas, over concerns it was being used for espionage. This after the DOJ announced that it has charged two Chinese hackers with trying to steal United States coronavirus research.Here with reaction, Louisiana Senator John Kennedy.You've been very outspoken on this. Look, the fact that after all of these years that we had people 30 and 40 years ago hacking into government agencies. If we don't fix this, it annoys the living daylights out of me. At what point is that our problem and our fault?SEN. JOHN KENNEDY, R-LA.: The Communist Party of China has become a world comorbidity, and America allowed it for well over 20 years. Too many of our leaders, Sean, got up every day and they just took the bullet train to chump town (ph). We didn't stand up to China.Now, we are. And we asked other countries to join with us.I don't want a cold war with China. China says -- the communist party in China says it wants respect. You have to earn respect.

The intellectual property theft has been a huge problem. Trade imbalance, a huge problem.We now must remove all the manufacturing, especially for vital items like agents of medicines and pharmaceuticals. How do -- what do you propose we do?KENNEDY: The first thing that I would do is ask other -- other members of the Western world to join with us. Australia is already there. The United Kingdom is already there.But I'm thinking specifically of our friends in Europe, the E.U. It's time that the E.U. grew some oranges and said, you know, we stand for something.

And they could be much stronger.But they are so worried about making money from and with China, that in my judgment, they sacrificed their values. I don't mean to overstate it. There have been a few countries that have pushed back, but they need to push back as a group, as an organization, particularly Germany.HANNITY: Well, I agree with everything. People in your state in every state in this country died because of what they did, and around the world. Why wouldn't people unite on that? We have about 20 seconds.KENNEDY: It's not just the coronavirus. It's everything else too, as bad as the coronavirus is, Sean.HANNITY: Yes. All right, Senator, always appreciate you being with us.

Some people on the left might say that Fox News or The Wall Street Journal is biased on the right,\" he explained. \"And others may say that MSNBC or The Washington Post\u00a0is biased on the left. And we know that when we pull up a news source -- we know what we're getting because there are hundreds if not thousands of them.\"But when there is only one platform -- when there's only Google\u00a0-- and you search\u00a0for something and they drop Breitbart to the 19th page or they drop Donald Trump Jr. to the 23rd page, you don't have the chance to say, 'Google isn't meeting my needs so I'm going to find another search engine.' It doesn't happen,\" Buck continued. \"It's a much different situation when you have a domination platform that's involved in political bias.

Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., during the hearing about 's acquisition of \u00a0and agreed that the circumstances surrounding the deal were suspect at best and should be investigated further by the federal government.\"It should have been dealt with by the Obama administration,\" Buck said. \"It was acquired during the Obama administration and it's clear that Facebook used coercion in acquiring Instagram. They threatened them and threatened to put them out of business unless the agreed to sell. And the CEO of Instagram said this at the time.\"He added,\u00a0\"It's one of those things where you can look back on it now and say, 'Instagram wouldn't be where it is now if it weren't for Facebook's resources and the merger.' But I do agree with Chairman Nadler that there are many red flags about that merger and it should be carefully scrutinized by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).\"Congress will continue its investigation into big tech and likely release a report on the findings before the November election, in an effort to lay the groundwork for legislation when new lawmakers are sworn in come January, Buck said.\"This isn't a partisan effort. This isn't an anti-business effort. This is an effort at making America stronger and I think both sides are willing to do that,\" he explained. \"The next step -- the process, where we are now -- we've got to listen to regulators. We've got to listen to consumer advocacy groups. We have to consider some of these privacy issues and decide if the law is sufficient and if the regulators have the resources they need and that's where we need to go next.

We are focused right now on Arizona, where they have had a big old spike in cases. And the vice president will be addressing the situation there in Phoenix, this as we're seeing just over the past couple of weeks double- digit spikes in key states, including 85, north of that right now, over the last couple of weeks. And the coronavirus count, at least with cases and hospitalizations, they're going kind of in two different directions. The cases are rising, the hospitalizations not nearly as much. And, in fact, deaths across the country continue to come down day by day. We're going to pick it all apart for you right now. The latest read on the White House with Kristin Fisher, who's been following all the fast-moving developments. Hey, Kristin. KRISTIN FISHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Hey, Neil. Well, right before the vice president landed in Phoenix, Arizona health officials announced a new daily record for coronavirus cases and deaths in their state. Now, the vice president was joined by Dr. Birx and other members of the Coronavirus Task Force. They were all wearing masks. And the goal of this trip -- they're not going to be there very long, but the goal of this trip is to really get an on-the-ground assessment of what it is like right now in one of the hottest hot spots in the country. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MIKE PENCE, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: With your leadership, with the full support of the federal government behind you, and the cooperation of the people of Arizona, we will slow the spread and we will flatten the curve. (END VIDEO CLIP) FISHER: Arizona's Governor Doug Ducey was also wearing a mask when he greeted the vice president on the tarmac. And he had this message for his constituents heading into the holiday weekend: (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. DOUG DUCEY (R-AZ): ... do go out, we want them to mask up. We want them to physically distance. We want them to wash their hands. We did take some actions to slow the spread of this virus in terms of gyms and bars and water park tubing and movie theaters will be a pause for the next 30 days. (END VIDEO CLIP) FISHER: And, remember, this comes just one day after Dr. Anthony Fauci said that, unless the United States can get this under control, we could see upwards of 100,000 new cases a day. As for President Trump, Neil, you know he has been under mounting pressure from Republicans, as well as Democrats, but what's new here is really Republicans, to wear a mask. And in an interview today with FOX Business' Blake Burman, he told Blake that he would be open to now wearing a mask, after weeks, months even, of declining to wear one. He now says that he would be open to wearing one if the situation warrants. So that's certainly a change in tone from President Trump -- Neil. CAVUTO: Yes, that's a big one. Kristin, thank you very, very much. In the meantime, as Kristin was speaking there, California is indeed confirming that it's shutting down bars, indoor dining for most residents, this as places like New York City are also pausing on restaurant openings, as viruses continue to surge across the country. Casey Stegall following it all from Dallas, Texas -- Casey. CASEY STEGALL, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Yes, Neil, let's talk about Florida, which is another big hot spot. As you well know, hospitalizations are a very important metric to watch when it comes to measuring how severe COVID-19 is impacting a particular community. And most states offer detailed information about that very data, either on their Web sites or their public dashboards. Florida does not, however. Right now, the Department of Health only shows cumulative hospitalizations for the virus across the whole state, no info about the current number of patients, what communities they're in, how many, many are in ICU or on ventilators. However, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis now says that information will soon be included in the state's reporting, because health experts have argued that data is extremely valuable, especially as Florida grapples with a surge of new cases, particularly among young people, one of the driving forces behind closing bars there. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. RON DESANTIS (R-FL): You have a responsibility not to come into close contact with folks who could be more vulnerable. And if we protect the vulnerable, we're going to be able to get through this patch adequately. (END VIDEO CLIP) STEGALL: Multiple communities across Florida have decided to close beaches for the holiday weekend, like in Miami, the Florida Keys and Palm Beach. Interestingly, new numbers from the CDC show coronavirus is not as deadly for younger patients. That is a little bit of good news, when we seem to be reporting all of the gloom and doom with this. In fact, nationwide, about 16 deaths are attributed to COVID in people under the age of 25. For contrast, more than 640,000 deaths are in patients above the age of 75 -- Neil. CAVUTO: Casey Stegall, thank you very, very much. Well, as you heard Kristin Fisher reported earlier, all the governors are making a push right now. The better part of valor would be to wear a mask. And no less than the president of the United States, in an interview with our Blake Burman, was open to the idea. Take a look at this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BLAKE BURMAN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Speaking of COVID-19, Goldman Sachs put out a model yesterday, saying that, if there is universal masks, it would be a net positive for GDP. We know the IHME model says that, if there were universal masks, that it would be beneficial, it would save lives. So, if there is an economic benefit, sir, and there is a public health benefit, sir, why not go forward and say there should be mandatory masks all across this country? DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Well, I don't know if you need mandatory, because you have many places in the country where people stay very long distance. You talk about social distancing. But I'm all for masks. I think masks are good. I would wear -- if I were in a group of people, and I was close... BURMAN: You would wear one? TRUMP: Oh, I would. I would. Oh, I have. I mean, people have seen me wearing one. If I'm in a group of people where we're not, you know, 10 feet away, and -- but, usually, I'm not in that position. And everyone's tested. Because I'm the president, they get tested before they see me. But, if I were in a tight situation with people, I would absolutely... BURMAN: Do you think the public will see that at some point? TRUMP: I mean, I would have no problem. Actually, I had a mask on. I sort of liked the way I looked. (END VIDEO CLIP) CAVUTO: Well, that's going to be welcome news to Chuck Grassley, with whom I was chatting earlier on FOX Business, when he was saying, maybe, just as an example, it would be wise for the president to wear a mask, so that people can blame him for it not being important if they don't wear a mask. Dr. Nicole Saphier with us right now on this mask news. What do you think, Doctor? DR. NICOLE SAPHIER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Hey, Neil, you heard it straight from the president's mouth. He doesn't have a problem with masks, and, by the way, he likes the way he looks in them. So, I -- yesterday, I actually said that I wasn't going to tell the president that he needed to wear a mask, but I recommended it, but, also, there's a logical reason, which the president just reiterated, on why he doesn't wear masks. He's constantly tested and those around him are constantly tested. But the good news is, for messaging purposes, he is saying that he is all for masks, especially when you cannot maintain social distancing. And I think that's the message going forward to Americans right now, as we're seeing rising cases in 35 states. Social distancing and mask wearing, unfortunately, that's our normal for right now. But the good news is, it's not forever, Neil. CAVUTO: All right, but, nevertheless, apparently, these phased reopenings are not guaranteed either. And we're seeing a number of states dial things back, the latest, California, which will be shutting down bars and restaurants in a good chunk of the Golden State. You know what's going on in Texas. You know what's going on in Arizona. What do you make of it all? SAPHIER: Well, Neil, unfortunately, people keep talking about the concept of herd immunity. And, really, herd immunity is essentially when a large amount of the population, upwards towards 60 to 70 percent, have been exposed to the virus and have developed some sort of immunity to it. Now, whether that is because of widespread infection or because of vaccines, right now, because that we have had so -- we know how severe this affects our elderly, the widespread transmission of the virus will cause a lot of deaths, which is why we're in a race for a vaccine. We have some excellent, promising results that have many companies, and so, hopefully, that we can do some sort of mitigation of the spread of this illness while we're waiting for a vaccine. Unfortunately, there's still viral transmission. Ever since mid-June, we're seeing rising cases, Neil. And there's a combination of these mass gatherings, whether it was the protests, Memorial Day celebrations, what have you, but there has been civil unrest that has caused a lot of people to get together, whether it's indoors, outdoors, that likely promulgated some of the spread of this virus. And so we have to take a step back and do what we can to lessen community spread. CAVUTO: Do these numbers jibe with what you thought they would be? In other words, I remember, we were talking in the middle of the lockdown here. You all but predicted, all right, we will see a spike in cases. Now, in certain states, it's been more than just a spike. But, nationally, how does it look to you? SAPHIER: Well, I would say -- it's really hard to say. I mean, if you look at the map right now, Neil, it's really just the small area of the Northeast, the ones that were hit the hardest in the beginning, that are still doing OK, New York, New Jersey, Connecticut. And the rest of the country are now hitting their first wave of the virus. I would have liked to have seen fewer cases of community spread, but, unfortunately, I think the civil unrest and these stay-at-home orders, the lockdown orders in states prematurely, may have led to this, Neil. The good news right now, as you have been mentioning, your reporters have been mentioning, the deaths are not paralleling the new cases. CAVUTO: Right. SAPHIER: But I'm cautiously optimistic, as there tends to be a lot lag time between the time that the deaths come from the rise in cases. And, also, Neil, the great news is that, yes, there are younger people testing positive right now, but that means now is the time to protect the vulnerable, because, if the young people have the cases, then it may be in a month where we actually see the elderly being infected again. CAVUTO: All right. SAPHIER: So, now is the time to be protecting the vulnerable. CAVUTO: All right, thank you, Doctor. We will watch it very closely. Good catching up with you. SAPHIER: Thanks, Neil. CAVUTO: Also getting more details on this alleged bounty that the Russians were placing on American soldiers. Forget about if and when the president was told. What if the intelligence itself is wrong? What the administration is saying -- after this. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ROBERT O'BRIEN, U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER: When it comes to the briefing, that's another false story. And I'm somewhat surprised that The New York Times ran with that story. The president was not briefed because, at the time of the -- of these allegations, they were uncorroborated. (END VIDEO CLIP) CAVUTO: All right, the national security adviser to the president saying, you know what, the story itself is problematic, and that maybe all this fuss over whether the Russians were paying bounty on American soldiers' lives might itself be wrong. Let's get the read from Mike Emanuel following these fast-moving developments. Mike, what are you hearing? MIKE EMANUEL, FOX NEWS SENIOR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT: Neil, good afternoon. A short time ago, the commander in chief weighed in on this issue in a newsy interview with our colleague Blake Burman from FOX Business. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: I think it's a hoax. I think it's a hoax by the newspapers and the Democrats. I agree with the intelligence people. I think, frankly, that many of the intelligence people didn't think it was something that even happened. And, if it did happen, the Russians would hear about it. (END VIDEO CLIP) EMANUEL: FOX News has learned the so-called Gang of Eight congressional leaders will receive a special briefing on this issue tomorrow in a secure facility on Capitol Hill. The Senate and House Intelligence committees are receiving briefings as well. Top Democrats say, they want answers. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. CHARLES SCHUMER (D-NY): President Trump, his number one job is to protect American soldiers, to protect the men and women who fight for us overseas. Instead of dithering about what he knew, what he didn't know, he should be talking -- he should have a plan. (END VIDEO CLIP) EMANUEL: Majority leader Steny Hoyer is demand a full briefing on the matter from top intelligence officials for the entire House of Representatives. Hoyer is calling the charge of Russia or any other nation paying people to kill Americans an extraordinarily serious matter -- Neil. CAVUTO: Thank you, my friend, Mike Emanuel, on that. Want go to Trey Gowdy right now, the former South Carolina congressman, so much more of. What do you think, Congressman? I mean, we're awaiting a White House press briefing. This will no doubt come up. That the story itself might be a little specious, what do you think? TREY GOWDY, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Yes. I mean, Neil, the word intelligence has this ring of infallibility around it, but I was on the House Intelligence Committee. Substitute the word information. Substitute the word evidence. Is the information reliable? Has it been corroborated? What is the source of the information? You have human intelligence and you have signal intelligence. So which was it here? But -- and then, if you can establish that, by what quantum of information or evidence do you need to know something before you brief the commander in chief? If there's a 1 percent chance it's true, are you going to tell him about it? Probably not. So, in D.C., almost every sentence begins, if true, and then they run with it. If true, it's treason. If true, he's unfit to be the commander in chief. How about we just find out whether or not it's true or not? Let's do that first. CAVUTO: If it is, what do you do? GOWDY: You find out who your briefer is, and you figure out why the briefer did not think it was important enough to bring it to your attention. Here's what I can tell you. John Ratcliffe briefed the House and the Senate yesterday morning and yesterday afternoon. You know what he did in between? Do you know what he did over his lunch hour, Neil? He dropped his youngest daughter off at the Naval Academy, where she will begin a decade's worth of service to this country in uniform. Robert O'Brien has a child that wears a uniform. Mike Pompeo wore the uniform of this country. If they believed that Russians were setting boundaries on soldiers, they would all three be in the president's office before this interview ended. So, look, I know they don't like President Trump. I know they don't want him to get reelected. But this is military. This is -- this is our country's interests. And what you're doing is maligning people like Ratcliffe and O'Brien and Pompeo, who would never allow bounties to be set on our soldiers, ever. CAVUTO: So, Congressman, you know the president very well. I know you're out of office, obviously. But you're an influential figure. Do you think that he has maybe picked up the phone and called Vladimir Putin himself, is there any truth to this, get to the bottom of it? GOWDY: I was actually with the president yesterday. And my guess is that he has charged Robert O'Brien and Johnny Ratcliffe and said, find out whether or not there's an evidentiary basis for this allegation. It's an incredibly important allegation. But before you call a principal, I want to know, was it something you read in a newspaper? Is it signal intelligence? Is it an e-mail? What is the source of this serious allegation about bounties? Because, otherwise, I mean, if you're not armed with facts, if you're not armed with credible evidence, how's that conversation going to go? Are you doing it? No. Nyet. We're not doing it. No. (CROSSTALK) CAVUTO: Do you think, then, Congressman, that this is a hoax? The president just told our Blake Burman, it's a hoax. Does it sound like a hoax to you? GOWDY: I don't -- he and I do not use the word hoax in the same way. I think what he is referring to, it is another drive-by hit piece by The New York Times. So, when he says hoax, I think he is referring to the source of this allegation. I do not think at all he considers the allegation that Russia would be putting bounties on our men and women to be a hoax at all. I have never gotten that impression. CAVUTO: All right. Trey Gowdy, thank you very much. Very good catching up with you. GOWDY: Yes, sir. CAVUTO: All right, in the meantime here, at the corner of Wall and Broad, we had a record of the Nasdaq today. So, if these increasing number of cases that we're hearing about regarding the virus are rattling investors, you didn't see it that much. It was in the Nasdaq that was the story today, not the Dow. The Nasdaq is the one that hit a record, on confidence right now that we're hiring a lot more folks, certainly in the private sector. And that has been the wind at this market's back now going into the third quarter. We shall see. We're exploring that in more detail in our next segment, because the president has already made it clear to our Blake Burman, if you go to that other guy, Joe Biden, it all ends -- after this. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) CAVUTO: All right, you're looking live at the White House Briefing Room, moments away from hearing from Kayleigh McEnany. There's a lot certainly going on today between the spike in cases and the spike in news stories right now concerning that alleged Russian bounty story. Stay with us. Back in 60. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) CAVUTO: All right, welcome back, everyone. I told you a little bit before how the Nasdaq sprinted to a record today, and we had the market average and just soaring in the last quarter, all of them. Year to date, they're not doing too shabby either. The president says, all this is frittered away if that other guy, Joe Biden, gets into the White House. Blake Burman, who hasn't been doing much today, caught up with him and made a little bit of news on that and a host of other subjects. Blake, very good to have you. BURMAN: Thanks, Neil. CAVUTO: On the markets and everything else going on, the president seemed to make clear, all this ends if I'm not here, right? BURMAN: Yes. And the backdrop for that question to President Trump was this when I spoke with him here at the White House earlier this afternoon. I asked the president about his tax plan and Joe Biden's tax plan and the difference. The vice president wants to raise taxes on the wealthy, wants to increase the corporate rate from 21 to 28 percent. So I asked President Trump, in this environment, of which there is double-digit unemployment right now, does he fear that the vice president's plan might actually play better in this election? And the president used that question to talk about what he thinks would happen to the stock market if he is not reelected. Watch here. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: And they say this. If he got elected, that's an overhang over the market, because the market would crash, would absolutely crash. BURMAN: What do you mean by crash? TRUMP: The market would go down by a tremendous amount. He would raise taxes. He would raise regulations. Look, one of the biggest things I have done is, I have cut regulations more than any president in history. We still have regulations, but they're much less. If Biden got in -- and, first of all, it wouldn't be him, because he's not into regulation. He doesn't know -- he doesn't know where he is, frankly. I watched his press conference yesterday. He's answering -- I mean, he's answering questions like this from a teleprompter. I said, what's that all about? But his people, the people around him are radical left. They are going to raise taxes. They are going to raise regulations. And they are going to put everyone out of business. It would be a disaster. (END VIDEO CLIP) BURMAN: Neil, one thing the markets and investors will be looking for is this phase four relief package down the line and the negotiations that will resume at some point later this month. The president telling me this afternoon that he will be speaking with Mitch McConnell tonight about next step measures. And when I asked the president about whether or not he supports another round of direct payments, the president said, at this point, he does -- Neil. CAVUTO: Remarkable job, my friend. BURMAN: Thank you. CAVUTO: You made so much news here, I couldn't keep up with it. BURMAN: Thanks, Neil. CAVUTO: Blake Burman, star of FOX Business, star on FOX, period, what a great job. A lot of big headlines there. Charlie Gasparino to react to just the one on Biden. What do you make of that? Because, Charlie, you have been reporting as well that there are those on the Street who get worried, because we always say, they're not Republican or Democrat. They love making money. They have made a lot of money under this president. And they don't want that jeopardized. But they do see the possibility of Joe Biden coming in, taxes will go up, right? CHARLIE GASPARINO, FOX NEWS SENIOR CORRESPONDENT: Well, I think the president was watching our conversation yesterday about this very issue. Yes, I mean, listen, this is -- he's on strong ground if he takes his campaign in this direction, I believe. And I have been reporting this out now for the last week. The Street, -- it's not showed up yet in the markets. But when you talk to financial advisers, to people who deal with small investors and manage their wealth, if you deal with large investors, they are worried about the massive changes that are going to come if Joe Biden gets elected. And, of course, if he gets elected, there's a good likelihood that they're going to take the Senate, so you have all three houses in one control. And what are those changes? CAVUTO: So, what is the change that they're looking at Charlie, specifically? What worries them the most? GASPARINO: Well, all of it. They're going to have -- they're going to -- they could run the gamut. They're going to reverse the Trump tax cuts on corporations, the corporate tax cuts. They're going to raise the upper rates. They're going to ramp up regulations, because Elizabeth Warren, whether she's either in the White House as Treasury secretary, or in the majority as the senator from Massachusetts, is going to have a big say in banking policy, in policies regarding -- regarding a whole host of issues. And she -- there is not one regulation that Elizabeth Warren doesn't like. I think Donald Trump, for all his missteps in terms of handling COVID and some other issues, he's on pretty strong grounds that the -- that there's going to be an economic 180 going on in this country if Biden gets elected. Now, of course, the Fed is going to be there, and the Fed is still going to be keeping interest rates low. CAVUTO: Right. GASPARINO: So, I don't know if we're going to have a market implosion. But we're clearly going to have a different economy, an economy that's going to look much more -- even more leftist than Obama. And, remember, the Obama years was incredibly slow growth. You got that on top of a recession. He's going to be doing this stuff amid a recession, because the current pandemic recession is not going to end by next year if he gets elected. CAVUTO: Yes. GASPARINO: You're still going to -- we're still going to have some rough times. It's -- I'm telling you, he's got a good case here, because it's a 180 from what we got today. And what we had today is this, before the pandemic -- just go by the numbers -- lower-income wages were rising. The market was doing pretty good. The -- I didn't go like his trade policy. I think -- I thought that really hurt economic growth. But take that -- take that off the table. You basically had 3 percent unemployment, I mean, and 2.5, 3 percent growth. CAVUTO: Got it. GASPARINO: OK? Joe Biden is basically proposing stuff that is a 180 of the policies that gave us that. You just have to -- if you're fair about it, you have to point it out. CAVUTO: All right. GASPARINO: And wealth managers have been doing it now for the last couple weeks, as Biden... (CROSSTALK) GASPARINO: ... polls. CAVUTO: Got it. All right, Charlie, thank you very, very much, my friend, Charlie Gasparino, on that. Again, we're not looking at this through the prism of politics here, just what the markets like. They don't care who's in the Oval Office, as long as they're making money. With this president, just as with a Democratic president they really liked as well, Bill Clinton, they made a lot of money. They liked making money. They're not red or blue. Green. They love money, money, money. All right, and you might not love what's going in American Airlines, but remember the middle seat? It's going to be occupied now. In fact, American leading a push to go full-throttle with fully staffed jets and every seat taken -- after this. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) CAVUTO: All right, so you like that empty middle seat on airplanes these days, at least what had been the case in American Airlines? Ending today. It's going to have a person in it, and it's going to be that way for a while. American Airlines going the full flight route today. Others in the industry could quickly follow. I wonder if Dr. Tom Frieden is worried about this. The former CDC director joins me right now. That's a lot of people crowded in a close space, Doctor. And American is leading the effort. Others, I suspect, could follow. Is it a good idea? DR. THOMAS FRIEDEN, FORMER DIRECTOR, CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION: Well, Neil, I can just say, the science is pretty clear. The more people you have packed together in small areas, particularly if they not wearing masks, particularly if it's indoors, the greater risk you have of spread. So, I think travelers will probably have to make decisions on that. But, fundamentally, the issue is larger than any one airline. It's larger than any one group. The virus has the upper hand in the U.S. right now. And if we work together, we can gain the momentum and begin to put it back into control, because, right now, not only is it at a high level, but it's increasing rapidly in many parts of the U.S. CAVUTO: And to your point, Doctor -- and you were ahead of this curve, warning about it -- the fact of the matter is, Michigan now dialing back some phased reopenings, shutting down bars, some indoor dining. The same, we're hearing out of California, where they're scaling things back, in Texas and Arizona, where they already have. What do you do? FRIEDEN: Well, one of the things we have to do is recognize that it's not just open vs. closed. It's more granular, more detailed. It's more like a dimmer dial. There's certain things that we're learning are really dangerous. First off, we're seeing big increases in young adults all over the country. So, the message has to get out more than what stays in young adult -- starts in young adults doesn't stay in young adults. We're all in this together. And we have seen many outbreaks from bars. You're talking about a small amount of space, lots of people together, not wearing masks, obviously, from many different places for many hours. That's essentially a formula inviting the virus in. What we need to do is keep the virus out. And that means there's a lot of things that we can do out of doors. That's way safer than indoors. There are things that we can do to safely restart our economy. For example, some states early on have allowed storefront pickup of -- from retail. That's a really smart idea. You're not going indoors and you're doing business there. So, there are lots of things that we can do to get used to this new normal of COVID. But if we just pretend it's not here, it's going to come back to bite us. CAVUTO: You know, there's also been this nationwide push. I think Nancy Pelosi wanted to make it a federal policy to wear a mask. Even the president telling our Blake Burman today, yes, he's open to that and will. What do you think? FRIEDEN: Well, fundamentally, the more people wear masks, the less the virus will spread. That's just the facts. Now, that means that it's particularly important in a community where there's a lot of COVID spreading, when you're inside, when you're within six feet of someone else. This is not a political statement. This is a statement that we're opposed to the virus, not that we're opposed to or in favor of any individual or group. But it's really important. It's one of the key things that we can do, wear a mask, wash your hands, and watch your distance. If we do that, we will be able to get our economy back sooner and faster. But we do have to move carefully in places where the virus is spreading rapidly, or it'll be really difficult to restart schools in the fall and our economy in the coming weeks and months. CAVUTO: All right, Doctor, thank you. Good words of advice, all. Appreciate it. Want to go to Senator Kevin Cramer right now, because, for a lot of businesses, they're still impacted by this, the South Dakota Republican, among others, pushing a new measure to extend the so-called Paycheck Protection Program at least until August, I believe August 8. Senator, where does this all stand right now? SEN. KEVIN CRAMER (R-ND): Well, as you probably know, Neil, the PPP was extended last night by unanimous consent vote here in the United States Senate. And it goes over to the House, I suppose, for their consideration or, more likely, maybe even ends up as part of the next CARES package. Or perhaps that $130 billion that so far has not been borrowed or lent gets repurposed for some other -- for some other purpose, based on what's -- what the demand is and what the tools are that the economy needs. CAVUTO: Right. By the way, Senator, I apologize North Dakota, not South Dakota, so my bad there. I'm wondering. You mentioned this is going to the House. I mean, could they change it, alter it, change some of the guidelines on who's receiving it? What have you heard? CRAMER: So, I think it's a great point, Neil. And I think that is a possibility, if not even a likelihood, remembering that we are soon to be leaving here for the Fourth of July holiday. We will be back about middle of July sometime for three more weeks, during which time I think the Senate and the House will be negotiating some sort of a phase four CARES Act. And so the House certainly could change that. It would have to come back over here for our agreement. But I think we have time to deal with it. Clearly, the demand for the PPP has largely been met. I mean, we have been sitting on about $130 billion balance for several weeks now. CAVUTO: Right. CRAMER: So, I do you think that there needs to be some tweaks, perhaps of some more focus and targeting CAVUTO: Do you worry, though, with all the move now to re-shut down some businesses or clamp down on capacity measures as part of this reopening phases, dial back a little bit, states like California and in Texas, Arizona, et cetera, are you concerned that you might have to fork over even more money, if this means some of these same businesses get back on the brink? CRAMER: Well, I am concerned about that, Neil. But I want to remind people, too, that there's still a lot of unallocated - - it's certainly appropriate, but several hundred billion dollars of unallocated dollars from the previous phase. And I think it's important that we consistently look at what the needs are, see what the changes are that we should be making to those -- to those dollars that have already been appropriated. But I want to also encourage people to not be driven so much by fear, whether small business, big business, airlines, or farming. Use the common sense and the guidelines that the government's provided, along with the brain that God gave you. But don't be so fearful that the cure does, in fact, become worse than the disease itself. I don't -- while I understand what your previous guest was talking about, I don't share his level of concern about it. I -- we need to protect elderly people. We need to protect grandma. But 35-year-olds, you know, we're going to have to learn to live with the disease, rather than let the disease force us to trade living in for surviving. And that's not just an economic position. I think that's just a practical living position that I take. CAVUTO: There's been a move afoot right now -- and we're going to raise this with a former police commissioner -- to defund police departments, Senator, especially in New York, where they're looking to shave better than a billion dollars from the budget. Minneapolis just wants to disband the police altogether. This is picking up steam. What do you think? CRAMER: I think that, if Minneapolis wants to kick all the police out, they might as well show the exit to all their businesses, and we'd welcome them in North Dakota, because we're not dumb enough to defund and get rid of our police departments. So I think, if locations want to be that foolish, then I think a market will pop up with states and communities that value the heroes that wear the badge and support public safety. And I think it could become a very interesting state-to-state competition, if you will. CAVUTO: Yes. Well, we might be there already. Senator, thank you very, very much. Good catching up with you on this. CRAMER: My pleasure. CAVUTO: And to the senator's point, I mean, it's not only getting rankles in Washington, how they're wanting to ease up on funding for police departments, but even in the police commissioner right now of New York City. Take a peek. He was saying some stuff there that was very concerning to him about Mayor Bill de Blasio's effort to lead about a billion-dollar trimming in the police budget. We're going to go right now to Kayleigh McEnany, who is addressing reporters right now. Let's take a look. (JOINED IN PROGRESS) KAYLEIGH MCENANY, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: .... to CHOP, but I'm told they went back to CHAZ -- was a failed four week Democrat experiment by the radical left and the results are in. Anarchy is anti-American, law and order is essential, peace in our streets will be secured. While the Democrat mayor of Seattle proclaimed that CHAZ was to be quote \"the summer of love,\" in fact it was not. And other failed Democrat politicians also remain passive, were even silent in the face of anarchy, but while that happened President Trump set the tone -- law and order must prevail to preserve peace in our streets. The president is not the Democrat governor of the state of Washington, the president is not the Democrat mayor of Seattle but nevertheless, the president must lead by example and be prepared to act in the face of failed Democrat leadership, which is what we saw in Democrat Seattle, in Democrat Wisconsin. President Trump has always stood on the side of law and order and we are pleased to report that law and order has prevailed and Seattle has been liberated from the anarchists. In President Trump's America, autonomous zones will have no sanctuary. The BHAZ, B-H-A-Z, which stood for the Black House Autonomous Zone, across from the White House was swiftly dismantled. 100 anarchists were arrested for rioting and destruction of federal property here in D.C. I believe that number's now above 300. Four men have been charged in federal court for attempting to tear down the statue of Andrew Jackson in Lafayette Square. And there are 200 open domestic terrorism investigations. You contrast the President's vision of law and order to that of the failed CHAZ experiment and anarchy and here's what you find in the failed Democrat experiment that took place out in Seattle. The Seattle Times said the shooting at Seattle's CHOP protest tragically killed a 16 year old boy, leaving a 14 year old seriously injured. That's what happens in an autonomous zone. The police chief Carmen Best, who did a marvelous job winding down the CHOP zone, noted that CHOP has become lawless and brutal and enough is enough and she took action. According to reports, quote \"police also investigated several vehicles circling the CHOP zone with people inside carrying fire -- firearms and wearing body armor.\" This was no quote \"summer of love,\" as the Democrat mayor in Seattle said and President Trump compelled action. He has said \"take back your city now, if you don't do it, I will.\" He has said \"this is not a game, these ugly anarchists must be stopped immediately. Move fast.\" And finally, the Democrat mayor in Seattle, who was long delayed, finally gave the order to dismantle the CHAZ and it was an admission -- it was an admission that President Trump's vision is right, that anarchy is wrong and that law and order bring peace. And with that, I will take questions. Kristen? QUESTION: Kayleigh, thank you so much. National Security Adviser Robert O'Brien said that the intelligence about the alleged Russia plot was being taken so seriously that U.S. allies were alerted and that it could impact military tactics. So how is that a hoax? MCENANY: Well as I mentioned yesterday, what happens when any intelligence comes in unverified, if there is any way that it could affect American troops or allies, it is immediately communicated on the ground to ensure that troops and commanders and generals can make the best decisions tactically speaking. So that's the way it's done. But what I would say is at the same time, until there's a strategic decision for the president to make, until it is verified, it is not briefed up to the president of the United States. That's how intelligence works. QUESTION: Is he angry or frustrated or upset about the fact that he was not in the loop on this, that members of Congress were briefed and U.S. allies were briefed? MCENANY: No, the president believes that and has great faith and Ambassador O'Brien and the others who made the decision that this shouldn't be risen to his desk. It was a career CIA officer with more than 30 years of tenure who made the decision not to brief it up and the National Security Adviser agreed with that decision. She's an excellent officer and does great work and made the decision not to brief it up. It was the right decision to make and at this moment, as I speak to you, it is still unverified. QUESTION: And Kayleigh, just a follow up very quickly. For you and Robert O'Brien and others who expressed real outrage about the leaks, is there outrage about what the Intelligence Community is investigating, which is the possibility of these Russian bounties targeting U.S. troops? MCENANY: Make no mistake that this administration has acted tough on Russia, always makes the decision that's in the best interest of protecting our troops, like killing General Soleimani, who killed 600 American troops, maimed thousands others, and al-Baghdadi. We always act in the best interest of our troops but this is unverified still at this very moment. Jon? QUESTION: Kayleigh, why is the president calling Black Lives Matter a symbol of hate? MCENANY: Well, what the president was noting is that that symbol -- when you look at some of the things that have been chanted by Black Lives Matter, like \"pigs in a blanket, fry them like bacon,\" that's not an acceptable phrase to paint on our streets. Look, he agrees that all black lives matter, including that of Officer David Dorn, Patrick Underwood, two officers whose lives were tragically taken amid these riots. All black lives do matter, he agrees with that sentiment, but what he doesn't agree with is an organization that chants \"pigs in a blanket, fry them like bacon\" about our police officers, our valiant heroes who are out on the street protecting us each and every day. QUESTION: But Americans of all races have protested in all 50 states around that phrase \"Black Lives Matter\" and the president is here calling it a symbol of hate? MCENANY: He is talking about the organization. I would note to you that the greater New York BLM president has said \"if this country doesn't give us what we want, that we will burn down the system and I could be speaking literally.\" I would call that a pretty hateful statement. Yes, Ben. QUESTION: But, Kayleigh, he's not talking about the organization in his tweet.. MCENANY: Yes, Ben. QUESTION: He says the words. He says the words. MCENANY: Which... QUESTION: Black lives matter. MCENANY: What's the name of the organization again? QUESTION: Black Lives Matter. MCENANY: There you go. You just answered my question. Go ahead, Ben. QUESTION: Question about coronavirus. Earlier today the president said, I think that at some point that's going to sort of just disappear I hope. He's hoping that it will disappear, the President's strategy at this point? MCENANY: No, the President's confident that it'll disappear, he's confident that he's put together a revolutionary first class team that is going to break through bureaucracy and get us a vaccine. He's confident that that will lead us to a place where we won't have COVID on our hands and in fact there was very pleasing news today from Pfizer and BioNTech that showed positive results for their vaccines. QUESTION: Dr. Fauci says that we're heading toward 100,000 cases per day. So, why does the president have evidence that it would just disappear? MCENANY: Well, one... QUESTION: (OFF-MIKE) distinguish between a vaccine and it just disappearing. MCENANY: One thing I would note with regard to cases, we're aware that there are embers in the country, we're aware that there are places with rising cases and that's why Dr. Birx is on the ground and others. We're continually assessing that, but one thing I would note is just that when you do test more people you do identify more cases and that is rapidly ongoing; we're testing more than 500,000 a day. To give you an example on April 6, really the height of the pandemic, we were doing 151,525 test. One day, Thursday is the number that I have here. We conducted 637,587 tests. So when you have more than a five fold increase in tests, you have a greater identification of cases. QUESTION: So you consider what's happening in Florida and Texas and Arizona as embers? MCENANY: I would say that those are -- we see rising cases, we see embers around the country, we always knew that would come with reopening, but those who are identifying as positive cases do tend to be younger individuals, as the Vice President noted and I think the increase in testing is part of the contribution to what we're seeing. Yes? QUESTION: Today, Mayor Bowser said her office has communicated with the Department of Interior about the Fourth of July celebration, and it's not, in her mind, in keeping with the CDC guidelines as well as D.C. Department of Health guidelines. The White House has said over and over again we should look to our local authorities for how we should act. Should the -- should the administration be following the local guidelines (OFF-MIKE) MCENANY: The president said that we should follow our local authorities with masks, so that's the decision that he encourages people to follow those authorities. The CDC guidelines, I would also note, say recommended but not required and we are very much looking forward to the Fourth of July celebration. Yes. QUESTION: Are you -- are you preparing some options for the president to consider for retaliation against Russia, should this intelligence conclude to be true? MCENANY: I won't get ahead of the president on action, I also won't get ahead of the intelligence, which at this moment is unverified. QUESTION: Does the president want this intelligence to be corroborated or not, or what has he told his advisers on this front? MCENANY: The president is -- it's unverified. It's being assessed. It's going through the same process normal intelligence would go through, but what's unfortunate is we're having this discussion because of the New York Times deciding to run with this erroneous information about the president being briefed, which was not true. And the erroneous information that there was a conclusion when in fact there was not a conclusion. Yes? QUESTION: Kayleigh, can you confirm that the CIA director and NSA director will brief the Congressional Gang of Eight tomorrow about the Russia bounties? MCENANY: Yes, that is the plan. QUESTION: OK. QUESTION: Two of them. Anyone else that will be briefing the Gang of Eight? MCENANY: I'm not entirely sure who else will be in that briefing. QUESTION: And can you also say does the president generally have confidence in the intelligence communities findings and conclusions about Russia? MCENANY: Yes, he does have confidence and he's many times acted on verified intelligence and there's times he's decided that's in our strategic interest not to act. I would give you the example of Soleimani and al- Baghdadi. And then the example of Iran shooting down the -- when Iran engaged in actions and the president said it's not time to engage because shooting down a -- shooting down a entity is not the same as loosing lots of civilian lives. Yes. (CROSSTALK) QUESTION: Thank you, Kayleigh. MCENANY: Shooting down a drone. Excuse me. Yes. QUESTION: The president has come under criticism this week for statements that he has made that his detractors say are dog whistles to a certain segment of his base that he is trying to gin up for reelection. Those include comments like kung-flu or heritage while talking about Confederate statues. And most recently they included the video that I know you discussed in here the other day, but the video of a supporter of his using the term \"white power.\" So why hasn't the president denounced that video and called that a hateful statement? MCENANY: The president took down that video, that deletion speaks strongly. What I would note, the president has repeatedly condemned hate. August of 2019 and one voice, our nation must condemn racism, bigotry and white supremacy. These sinister ideologies must be defeated if hate has no place in America. In April 2019, we have no tolerance for those who disrupt this peace and we condemn all hate and violence, especially in our places of worship. August 2018, I condemn all types of racism. He's repeatedly done this. QUESTION: Why hasn't he denounced that specific video and said that that is hateful language that was used in it? MCENANY: He deleted it. The deletion speaks for itself. His repeated condemnations of hate speak for themselves, and this is a president who has repeatedly condemned hate and repeatedly encouraged for us all to come together. Yes? QUESTION: Thank you, can -- did the president meet today with Senate Republican Leader McConnell about the future recovery aid package, and is there any sort of agreement on additional unemployment insurance or stimulus payments? MCENANY: Yes, so I have no announcements with regard to his meetings, but what I would say is he did mention that in a phase four, he would be open to direct payments. On the point of unemployment insurance, one thing that he's concerned about is he does not want to see an incentive not to work. An enhanced unemployment benefits that Senator Schumer has suggested would be an incentive for people not to get back to work and he wants to encourage people to get back to work. And at the same time, he's mentioned a payroll tax holiday, a big one for our workers. That helps those who are on the lowest end of the payroll, it would help the Americans who need it most. So those are some things he's talked about for phase four. QUESTION: Hi, you used the word embers to describe the coronavirus, but yesterday, another all-time record of 47,000 cases, and four times this week, a new record. Why do you use the word embers when many people would say it's like a wildfire? MCENANY: So I used the word embers because that is what the president has acknowledged that would happen around the country. You would see spikes across the country. He said, at time, you would see a fire across the country, embers, fires, but at the same time I would note the increase in cases that are -- the increase in testing is -- sixfold increase in testing, you identify more cases. I would also note that Secretary Azar said that we've seen nationwide that fatalities at a two month low. So this is a different situation when those who are testing positive are younger. We have increased tests. We are aware where there are surges. It's why Dr. Birx is on the ground, but we believe we are equipped to handle what we see on the horizon. QUESTION: So how does the president -- the president made a conscious decision to talk less about the virus. Town hall, Sean Hannity, someone mentioned it was only three minutes that he discussed it. He tweets about it far less often than he used to? MCENANY: The president is not focused on talking, he's focused on action, and this administration has taken historic action with regard to the coronavirus. We have an excess amount of PPE, surge -- a huge amount of ventilators in the stockpile, things that could never be done, we were told, have been done under this administration, testing more than 600,000 a day. This president has done a historic job with regards to the coronavirus. (OFF-MIKE) QUESTION: Thank you. The president yesterday tweeted that he is angry against China. Is anger against China in India also? So, India has banned 59 apps from China, including TikTok. How -- does the president (OFF-MIKE) about it and what are his views on this? MCENANY: So, with regard to India and China, we're closely monitoring the situation. He is as well. Both India and China have expressed a desire to de-escalate and we support a peaceful resolution of the current situation, and he said that China's aggressive stance along the India-China border fits with the larger pattern of Chinese aggression in other parts of the world and these actions only confirm the true nature of the Chinese Communist Party. QUESTION: Ban on TikTok, India banning the TikTok app? MCENANY: No announcements on that, I would just point you to what Secretary Pompeo said earlier. Yes? QUESTION: What will we expect the president to play in on Israel's plan to annex part of the West Bank and the Jordan Valley, and how much does this delay perhaps have to do with the concern about (OFF-MIKE) here in the United States who, of course, are really an important part of the presidents base in reelection? MCENANY: Yes, so I have not spoken to him about that specific issue, but he's a great supporter of Israel and I would just leave it at that. QUESTION: But, Kellyanne, there could be something this week, so I'm just wondering what the delay is and maybe you could weigh in. There are concerns this could be the final nail in the coffin on the Palestinian state. What is the president thinking about? MCENANY: So no announcements on that front, and I won't get ahead of him on anything that would happen this week or beyond. Yes? QUESTION: The president has said in this room that he wants to meet the Taliban leadership. Now that world leaders are coming here again, is that on the corral, is that going to happen soon? Is there a timetable? MCENANY: So, again, I won't get ahead of the president on that. What the president wants is to see our troops come home from Afghanistan. He has been on the record being against keeping a sustained presence in Afghanistan. He does not believe in foreign adventurism and wars that drag on. He believes the ultimate way to secure our troops is to bring them home. Yamiche. QUESTION: Well, has the -- has the report of the Russian bounty for Taliban fighters affected that calculus? MCENANY: That's unverified intelligence that's currently being assessed. Yamiche? QUESTION: Hi. Thanks, Kayleigh. The first question I have -- two questions. The first is, on Monday, the president went after stripping racist names on buildings.

Welcome to Washington. I am Bret Baier. Breaking tonight, it will likely get worse before it gets better, that from President Trump a short time ago in a solo coronavirus press briefing. The president saying wearing a mask is patriotic and he will push harder for people to wear them in close quarters. Its President Trump's coronavirus briefing his first in 85 days, the president says a vaccine, and effective therapeutics will be coming sooner than anyone thought possible. Meantime, on the statistics, Florida has overtaken Texas in average daily deaths from the coronavirus. Florida average 115 deaths per day last week, tapping Texas' figure of 112. Total U.S. deaths are now approaching 150,000. That is the most reported globally with total infections closing in on the four million mark. The CDC says true COVID infection rates were more than 10 times higher than reported cases in most U.S. regions from late March to early May. This occurs as talks between the White House and Congress over the next round of coronavirus aid funding hit a bit of a stumbling block, the administration trying to push that through. The Justice Department meantime is accusing two Chinese hackers of stealing hundreds of millions of dollars of trade secrets from companies around the world, including those working on a vaccine. Chief White House correspondent John Roberts starts us off tonight with the president's latest promise or threat to send federal forces into cities as well to stop street violence but the coronavirus briefing taking the priority. Good evening, John. JOHN ROBERTS, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Good evening to you Bret. They kept us guessing what happened to the last minute, who might come out with the president but as you pointed out, it was the president solo for his first coronavirus briefing since May 11th. The president optimistic about the prospects for a vaccine and the development of new treatments. The president also pointing out that the case fatality rate from coronavirus here in the United States is now lower than that of the European Union. The intention of all of this, to present the appearance of a president on top of the situation. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Two vaccine candidates are entering the final stage of clinical trials this month. This was achieved in record time. It used to be years before you were in a position like we are right now. Four other vaccines will enter final trials in the following weeks and we are mass-producing all of the top candidates so that the first approved vaccine will be available immediately and logistically we have the military ready to go. (END VIDEO CLIP) ROBERTS: And as President Trump moves to get back out in front of the coronavirus response, he also had a lot in order on his mind today and the federal response to the growing violence in cities across the country. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ROBERTS: The White House today doubled down on the president's pledge to send federal law enforcement into troubled cities across America, insisting state and local leaders, all of them Democrats, don't want to solve the problem. KAYLEIGH MCENANY, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: Democrats continue to put politics above peace while this president seeks to restore law and order. ROBERTS: While there are no immediate plans to deploy more federal officers, administration officials say the idea is an expansion of operation legend in Kansas City where agents from the FBI, U.S. Marshals Service, DEA, and ATF are assisting local law enforcement. The operation requested by Republican Governor Mike Parson is named for a LeGend Taliferro, a 4-year-old who was shot and killed while he slept on June 29th. MCENANY: This has been a successful operation that has been waged in his name, including the arrest of a wanted fugitives. ROBERTS: But the Democratic mayor of Kansas City joined with his colleagues in Portland, Seattle, Atlanta, and Chicago sending a letter to the DOJ and DHS yesterday urging them to withdraw federal officers from cities. The mayor said in part, deployment of federal forces in the streets of our communities has not been requested nor is it acceptable. These are tactics we expect from authoritarian regimes, not our democracy. It is concerning that federal law enforcement is being deployed for political purposes. Politics was front and center in a memo President Trump signed today instructing the Commerce Department to exclude illegal immigrants in the United States from the so-called apportionment base in the 2020 census. The apportionment base is used to determine the number of congressional seats a state is allocated. But a statement the president saying, my administration will not support giving congressional representation to aliens who enter or remain in the country unlawfully, because doing so would create perverse incentives and undermine our system of government. The American Civil Liberties Union, which successfully blocked an attempt by President Trump to add a citizenship question to the census fired back. In a statement saying, we'll see him in court and win again. And as President Trump led his first coronavirus briefing in three months, the Justice Department today announced it was charging two Chinese nationals with among other things, hacking networks in the U.S. and around the world of companies developing coronavirus vaccines, testing technology, and treatments probing for weaknesses. JOHN DEMERS, ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL, NATIONAL SECURITY DIVISION: In this indictment, we don't allege that they obtain that information. We do know that they were looking to obtain it by their computer intrusion activity. (END VIDEOTAPE) ROBERTS: President Trump said this afternoon, when it comes to the November election, he expects that voters will judge him on his and his administration's response to the coronavirus crisis but that they would also judge him on other things like the economy, rebuilding the military, and revamping the Department of Veterans Affairs, Bret. BAIER: John, quickly, he said at the end that this will be a frequent event. Do you have a sense there how frequent? ROBERTS: I don't think it will be daily as it was in the initial days of this crisis but I think we're going to see the president up in front of the cameras a lot more than we have in the past. And I think the reason for that is the president can't hold these big political rallies and Joe Biden is making lots of speeches, so the president is trying to find an opportunity to do it himself, Bret. BAIER: John Roberts, live in the North Lawn. John, thanks. The surgeon general meantime saying the U.S. needs to lower the infection rate to get students back in classrooms. Some teachers are suing actually to stay out of the classrooms and away from possible infection. We're learning new information tonight about the search for a vaccine. We saw some of that in John's piece. Correspondent Casey Stegall has more on that from Dallas. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DR. JULIE GERBERDING, EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT, MERCK: The race is on, not against each other but against this virus. CASEY STEGALL, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT: Leaders from five pharmaceutical companies' updated lawmakers today stay on their coronavirus vaccine development. DR. MACAYA DOUOGUIH, HEAD OF CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT AND MEDICAL AFFAIRS AT JANSSEN VACCINES, JOHNSON & JOHNSON: We are still in the process of designing our phase three trials. STEGALL: U.S. health officials remain optimistic one could be ready by later this year or early 2021. And it can't come soon enough, as Johns Hopkins University reports more than 14.7 million cases worldwide and more than 611,000 deaths. More than 141,000 of those fatalities are here in the U.S., the tenth highest per capita across the globe. On Monday, seven states logged record highs of hospitalized COVID patients including Florida but the governor says there is still plenty of space. GOV. RON DESANTIS (R-FL): Statewide 24 percent of the hospital beds in the state of Florida are empty. That's over 14,000 hospital beds and about 20 percent of the ICU beds. STEGALL: The pandemic not only has states grappling with how to open classrooms, there are also challenges with extracurricular activities like sports. In California, the high school fall sports schedule has been delayed until December. While in Texas, the season start depends on the school's size. RON NOCETTI, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, CALIFORNIA INTERSCHOLASTIC FEDERATION: In the best interest of the health and safety of our student-athletes that we need our school districts going to return to school first and then look at athletics down the road. STEGALL: The U.S. surgeon general says lowering the country's transmission rates is the most important factor in opening schools, adding the best way to do that is by wearing a mask. DR. JEROME ADAMS, U.S. SURGEON GENERAL: Please understand that we are not trying to take away your freedom when we say wear a face covering. We're saying if we do these things, we can actually open and stay open. We can get back to school, to worship, to jobs. (END VIDEOTAPE) STEGALL: And Hawaii is going ahead with reopening schools. In fact, students there are scheduled to get back into the classrooms in just about two weeks from now, Bret. BAIER: Casey Stegall in Dallas. Casey, thanks. Stocks were mixed today, the Dow gained 160. The S&P 500 finished ahead, five. The NASDAQ lost 87. The conflict between the city governments and the Trump administration over who should be responding to civil unrest in the streets is coming into sharper focus tonight as the president threatens to send more federal forces to unruly locations throughout the country, there are constitutional questions being raised. Acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf, says while his department supports peaceful protest, what is happening nightly in Portland, Oregon, for example, is the opposite of that. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CHAD WOLF, ACTING SECRETARY, HOMELAND SECURITY: Individuals trying to set fire to a building are no longer protesting, they are criminals. We cannot let one of our cities continue to experience this lawlessness night after night. (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: Correspondent Dan Springer is in Seattle tonight with more on that story. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DAN SPRINGER, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT: More late-night mayhem and rioting on the streets of downtown Portland with federal officers inside the federal courthouse, a protester tries to remove the plywood protecting glass windows and doors. Portland police did not engage the rioters but federal agents did, firing tear gas and flash-bang devices. Arsonists set several fires. Protesters threw one agent to the ground and looted a jewelry store. The violence comes as debate rages over President Trump's use of federal agents in Portland. Cell phone video shot last week showed agents in fatigues detaining people and walking them to unmarked cars. It prompted a lawsuit from Oregon's attorney general. And today, concern from the Pentagon where Defense Secretary Esper is worried about federal officers being confused for military soldiers. MARK ESPER, U.S. DEFENSE SECRETARY: We want a system where people can tell the difference. SPRINGER: But Customs and Border Protection's defense the uniforms and the arrests, saying the men were suspected of assault against federal agents or destruction of federal property. Those two were later released but 13 others faced federal charges. Democratic mayors of several cities signed a letter to the Trump administration, saying they do not want federal officers sent their way. BILL DE BLASIO (D), MAYOR OF NEW YORK: It's literally the federal government coming into a situation that -- you know, local officials were addressing and making it much worse. SPRINGER: Seattle's mayor also signed the letter, even as 12 local officers were injured during violence over the weekend. Police body cam video shows what happened when officers stopped a protester from covering a precinct surveillance camera with an umbrella. They were hit with bottles and fireworks. (END VIDEOTAPE) SPRINGER: Seattle's elected officials have also now been hit with a wrongful death lawsuits stemming from the CHOP protest zone. The family of a 19-year old who was shot and killed inside the Capri area blamed the city for allowing the CHOP and all of its dangers to exist, Bret. BAIER: Dan Springer in Seattle, Dan, thanks. There are new revelations tonight about one of the key figures in the Justice Department investigation into the Trump campaign's alleged involvement in the Russian election interference in 2016. We know what came from that but there's new information tonight. Correspondent David Spunt has that story this evening. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DAVID SPUNT, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT: Four years after allegations of collusion between the Russians and Donald Trump's campaign, a newly declassified note from the man who helped run the investigation tells a different tale. We have not seen evidence of any individuals affiliated with the Trump team in contact with IOs, IOs meaning Russian intelligence officers, wrote to an FBI agent Peter Strzok, according to newly declassified documents released on Friday. That sentence infuriates allies of the president who have long insisted collusion with Russia is political folklore. Former assistant U.S. attorney and Fox News contributor Andrew McCarthy in an op-ed yesterday wrote how much wasted time on pointless investigations could have been prevented had Peter Strzok said this publicly one month into President Trump's term. Strzok wrote that comment next to a February 2017 New York Times article, alleging contacts between the Trump campaign and the Russians. Senate Judiciary Chairman Lindsey Graham released the documents to the public. In a statement to Fox News, Strzok's attorney wrote in part, Senator Graham's statement represents another attempt by President Trump's congressional lackeys to use Pete's work product to paint the Russia investigation as a political witch hunt. It was no such thing, and Pete's comments on inaccuracies in the NYT article were nothing more than a dedicated counterintelligence professional diligently vetting public reports of intelligence information. The declassification comes as U.S. Attorney John Durham continues his probe into the origins of the Russia investigation. MARK MEADOWS, WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF: I think the American people expect indictments, I know. I expect indictments based on the evidence I've seen. It's all starting to come unravel -- to unravel and I tell you, it's time that people go to jail and people are indicted. (END VIDEOTAPE) SPUNT: A DOJ official tells me to expect the Durham report to be complete before the end of the summer, that's two months from today, the clock is ticking, Bret. BAIER: More on all of this with the panel. David, thanks. In tonight's Democracy 2020 report, Joe Biden is laying out new plans to spend trillions of taxpayer dollars if he's elected president in November. But it's targeted towards certain efforts, the total price tag for the promises is large and it's all in late July. He's laying it out in pieces, his economic plan. Correspondent Peter Doocy takes a looks at the Biden wish list so far. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PETER DOOCY, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT: Joe Biden believes he can put millions to work in an instant. JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: They are shovel ready. The workers are ready now. These jobs can be filled now. DOOCY: Caregivers, both professional and informal are set for 775 billion taxpayer dollars overleaf if Biden wins as he tries to alleviate finances stretch thin during the pandemic he argues has been exacerbated by President Trump. BIDEN: He's quit on you and he's quit on this country. DOOCY: The new policies Biden has rolled out in the last few weeks would cost north of eight trillion taxpayer dollars according to calculations done by . That's an eight with 12 zeroes after it. SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN (D-MA): We can't afford not to do this. Now, Vice President Biden has put his pay force in his plan. DOOCY: The money for this plan comes from rolling back recent tax relief for real estate investors, at a time real estate markets are changing with millions still working from home. BIDEN: The way we pay for it is by rolling back unproductive tax cuts. DOOCY: The Trump campaign argues, \"Just like the rest of the radical Democrats who have co-opted his campaign, the only thing Biden knows how to do is raise taxes, kill jobs, and passed regulations that strangle small businesses.\" The Democratic convention is in less than a month, so, an announcement about this former vice president's running mate is close. BIDEN: I've been through one of these vets, as they say. It takes about six weeks and you go into everything. It's like having a public physical examination. DOOCY: Who is it going to be? JOY REID, NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT, MSNBC: Are you committed to naming a black woman as your vice presidential running mate? BIDEN: I am not committed to naming any, but the people I've named and among them, there are four black women. DOOCY: Biden's challenge is picking someone who keeps the base excited. BIDEN: Let's get the hell head cup. (END VIDEOTAPE) DOOCY: Just like Biden's last in-person event last Tuesday, this one was closed to the public, except for a small group of press and a handful of invited educators, and it was close to home. The drive from his place in Wilmington to the socially distanced speech in Newcastle, 20 minutes. Bret. BAIER: Peter, thank you. A Republican Party official tells Fox News, the GOP believes state, local, and federal officials will be able to ensure a safe nominating convention next month in Jacksonville, Florida. Monday, the sheriff there said his police department lacks the resources, funding, and manpower to adequately provide security during the event. Last week, the GOP said it will implement an array of health safety protocols, including on-site temperature checks, providing personal protective equipment, aggressive sanitizing protocols, and available COVID-19 testing. We talk about all of that, be sure to check out my podcast, \"THE CAMPAIGN\", which comes out every Tuesday, 5:00 p.m. Eastern. It's out now. You can download it on = or wherever you download podcasts, it's there. It's a great panel discussion, in-depth about the state of the presidential race right now. Up next, new details on the case of that St. Louis husband and wife facing charges for using weapons defending their own home. We'll take you there. First, here is what some of our Fox Affiliates around the country are covering tonight. Fox 8 in Columbus, with the arrest of the Ohio statehouse speaker and four other people. FBI agents were at the farm of Republican Larry Householder this morning. The person briefed on the case says the arrest are in connection to a $60 million federal bribery probe, racketeering. Governor Mike DeWine, also a Republican has called on Householder to resign. Fox 42 in Omaha, as Nebraska lawmakers approve a bill allowing college athletes to sign endorsement deals with shoe companies, car dealerships, and other sponsors. It would cover athletes in all sports, although the University of Nebraska's football, basketball, and volleyball players are likely to have the most money-making opportunities. And this is a live look at New York from Fox 5, our affiliate there. One of the big stories there tonight, former Trump personal lawyer Michael Cohen is suing Attorney General William Barr and the Bureau of Prisons director. Cohen, says he is being unjustly held behind bars to stop him from finishing a book that criticizes President Trump. Cohen was furloughed in May but sent back to prison earlier this month. No comment so far from the Justice Department. That is tonight's live look \"OUTSIDE THE BELTWAY\" from \"special report.\" We'll be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BAIER: Federal investigators are examining whether a suspect in the ambush shooting of a federal judge's family in New Jersey is also responsible for the killing of a fellow men's rights lawyer in California. Roy Den Hollander is suspected of posing as a FedEx driver when he open fire at the judge's home, Sunday, killing her son, wounding her husband. Hollander was found dead of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound. President Trump, thinks the top prosecutor in St. Louis is abusing her power in bringing weapons charges against a couple who displayed guns while protesters march past their home last month. The president is not alone in that opinion. Here is correspondent Matt Finn. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MCENANY: It is absolutely absurd what is happening to the McCloskeys. MATT FINN, FOX NEWS CHANNEL NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Today, the White House, again showed its support for the St. Louis couple now charged with felony unlawful use of a weapon for brandishing guns as a crowd of protesters gathered outside their home on a private street, shortly after the death of George Floyd sparked nationwide riots and looting. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Keep moving! FINN: Mark McCloskey tells Fox News, he and his wife Patricia were just protecting themselves and no crime was committed. MARK MCCLOSKEY, RESIDENT, ST. LOUIS: The people that broke into my neighborhood, they're all trespassing. The prosecutor -- the circuit attorney has apparently decided that her job as a prosecutor isn't to keep us safe from criminals but to keep the criminal safe from us. It's a bizarre, upside down world. FINN: The president slamming the charges. MCENANY: He noted that this is an extreme abuse of power by the prosecutor. FINN: St. Louis Circuit Attorney Kim Gardner, says she brought charges after a thorough police investigation, and rights in part, \"It is illegal to wave weapons in a threatening manner at those participating in non- violent protest. And while we are fortunate this situation did not escalate into deadly force; this type of conduct is on acceptable in St. Louis.\" Missouri's attorney general, says Missourians have broad rights to defend themselves and he will enter the case just to dismiss it. And the governor, says he will pardon the couple if convicted. GOV. MIKE PARSON (R-MO): They had every right to protect their property, their home, just like any of us would. MCCLOSKEY: I'm not going to be bullied. I'm not going to be intimidated. (END VIDEOTAPE) FINN: The McCloskey's likely don't face real jail time even if they were convicted. Prosecutor suggested a diversion program to avoid time in court. Bret. BAIER: Matt Finn, thanks. Up next, why some house Republicans want one of their own leaders to step down from leadership. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BAIER: \"BREAKING TONIGHT\" There's something of a political mutiny tonight among House Republicans. One of the top figures is under attack from some inside the GOP Conference. Congressional correspondent Chad Pergram, tells us about it from Capitol Hill this evening. Good evening, Chad. CHAD PERGRAM, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Good evening, Bret. Well, this exploded today at a meeting of the House Republican Conference, which is chaired by Liz Cheney of Wyoming. There are some Conservatives who believe that Cheney has been too deferential toward Dr. Anthony Fauci. They also don't like her opposition to President Trump's plans to withdraw troops from Afghanistan and Germany. Now, Republican Congressman Matt Gaetz of Florida, he escalated the feud. He tweeted, quote that Cheney worked against the president and should step down as the number three Republican in the House. Donald Trump Jr. then-tweeted, \"We already have one Mitt Romney, we don't need another.\" Cheney brushed off criticism from the president's son. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. LIZ CHENEY (R-WY): Donald Trump Jr. is not a member of the House Republican Conference. We have a situation in many cases wherein our conference we can have a healthy exchange of views. Unfortunately, you don't see that as much in the Democratic caucus. (END VIDEO CLIP) PERGRAM: One Republican member told Fox that Conservatives are doubling down on Cheney, because, \"There is a growing sense that we are going to lose this election big time and they are lining up someone to blame.\" Now, Cheney took a pass on the Wyoming Senate race this year as some conservatives instead backed former GOP Wyoming Representative Cynthia Lummis. Part of that calculus is that Cheney could emerge down the line as Republican leader or speaker. Now, there are only 13 House Republicans and women. Cheney is the only one with a major leadership position. Some Republicans will tell you privately that they think that Cheney could defeat Kevin McCarthy or Steve Scalise in a leadership race. Bret? BAIER: Chad Pergram live on Capitol Hill. Chad, thanks. President Trump is warning mail-in voting could lead to the most corrupt election in U.S. history. His opponents are pushing back hard to that. The president has some company, though, in predicting a mail-in meltdown. FOX Business Correspondent Hillary Vaughn shows us tonight. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) HILLARY VAUGHN, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: This set off an avalanche of mail-in ballots. GOV. ANDREW CUOMO (D-NY): If you want to vote, we should send you a ballot so you can vote so you don't have to come out and get on line. VAUGHN: It flooded post offices during New York's primary. It wasn't the number of ballots that was problematic for the Post Office, but the prepaid envelopes that Governor Cuomo asked for to make voting easy. Because they weren't being postmarked with the date, leaving officials with no way to know if thousands of uncounted ballots were mailed in time to be counted. Now 28 days after Election Day, a congressional race in New York's 12th district is in limbo, waiting for a winner. A \"Wall Street Journal\" editorial warns, quote, \"It's a dark omen for November.\" KAYLEIGH MCENANY, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: Nineteen percent of ballots have been rejected in Queens, 28 percent rejected in Brooklyn. There are questions about mass mail out voting. VAUGHN: This presidential election in the middle of a pandemic means vote by mail could be more popular than ever, and could prove to be a stress test for the U.S. Postal Service that's drowning in debt. And now the new postmaster general is going on a cost cutting spree, warning, quote, \"We may see mail left behind or mail on the workroom floor or docks.\" That delay means voters are on deadline. The USPS says voters need to request a ballot at least 15 days before Election Day, but say, quote, \"The Postal Service's financial condition is not going to impact our ability to process and delivery election and political mail.\" They are snafus, though, with snail mail. GOV. LARRY HOGAN, (R) MARYLAND: The State Board of Elections screwed up getting ballots out. They mailed the wrong ballot. (END VIDEOTAPE) VAUGHN: Maryland's Governor Larry Hogan says some voters were surprised last month to open up their mailbox and get their primary ballots in Spanish. Bret? BAIER: Hillary, thank you. The president hosts his first Coronavirus Task Force briefing in months solo. We'll get reviews from the panel and a look at the data when we come back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, (R) PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: It will probably, unfortunately, get worse before it gets better. Whether you like the mask or not, they have an impact, they'll have an effect, and we need everything we can get. I view it this way. Anything that potentially can help, and that certainly can potentially help, is a good thing. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Do you want the American people to judge on the ballot in November by how you handled this pandemic so far? TRUMP: I think the American people will judge us on this, but they will judge us on the economy that I created and that already we're creating. (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: President Trump talking about the coronavirus in his first briefing about the coronavirus and about 85 days. He did it solo, but he did it succinctly, and took some questions as well. Let's bring in our panel, Mara Liasson, national political correspondent for National Public Radio, Guy Benson, political editor at = , the host of \"The Guy Benson Show\" on FOX News Radio, and Kimberley Strassel, a member of the editor board at \"The Wall Street Journal.\" Mara, this was shorter than the previous Coronavirus Task Force briefings, and obviously he was solo. MARA LIASSON, NATIONAL POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, NATIONAL PUBLIC RADIO: He was solo. It was shorter. He had a really different tone, masks are good. He was sober and realistic, it's going to get worse before it gets better. The fact that he did it at all I think sends an important message because he had pretty much moved on. The economy was reopening, he wanted schools to reopen, he wasn't really talking about the virus much. But there he was all by himself in the briefing room for only 35 minutes, I think. BAIER: Right, but the first part of that, Guy, was really substantive. Obviously, he was reading from prepared remarks, but talking about the vaccines, the therapeutics, the numbers, their responses to governors, things that maybe the American people hadn't heard in a while from the administration. GUY BENSON, FOX RADIO HOST: Yes, I'm glad that it's back, meaning the briefing, for that very reason. The pandemic is ongoing, it is serious, it is real, it is worsening in some places. And so I think it's worthwhile to have been doing this, frankly. So they brought it back. I'm glad that it was so succinct, to use your word, 30 minutes or so. He was roughly on time as well. I think that's probably a smart way to play it. I personally would have liked to have seen at least one medical expert there with him to field technical questions about various issues. And I know there weren't that many questions that were fielded by the president, but I'm sort of surprised that none of them tried to drill down on what he meant exactly by it's going to get worse before it gets better. That's a striking comment from the president given that the death numbers really have come down overall. What does he mean by that? Maybe we'll get an answer tomorrow. BAIER: Obviously, real questions about testing and how effective it is and what it means for opening schools. By the way, a deep tease. We're going to have Dr. Birx on SPECIAL REPORT tomorrow on this show to answer a lot of the medical questions. So please email in or tweet me @BretBaier with your questions. Kimberley, your thoughts on this effort today? KIMBERLEY STRASSEL, WALL STREET JOURNAL: If felt to me very much like an attempt at a reset. I think a lot of people in the White House understand that there is an immense bully pulpit here for the president, one in which he could not only impart really useful, as you noted, information to the people, but also just to project an image from a political perspective, look as though he is in charge, look as though he's doing what's necessary, a strong leader. Those past, prior events and briefings tended to spiral out of control at some point, so the fact that it was brief, that it was focused, suggested there's been a rethink about how they might use the briefing to the president and the nation's benefit. BAIER: Meantime, Mara, there is another COVID bill that's in the works but seems like it's being stalled a bit. Take a listen to Senators McConnell and Schumer. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MITCH MCCONNELL, (R) SENATE MAJORITY LEADER: The American job market needs another shot of adrenaline. Senate Republicans are laser focused on getting American workers their jobs back. And speaking of building on what worked in the CARES act, we want another round of direct payments, direct payments to help American families keep driving our national comeback. SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY), SENATE MINORITY LEADER: The Republican majority in the Senate dithered and delayed on the next phase of major emergency relief. Republicans seem to want to play chicken with pandemic relief and string everyone along with a bill in the process we all know is doomed to fail. (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: Yet Treasury Secretary Mnuchin says we're going to spend what we need to spend. The president says we're going to do what we need to do. What do you think this is, Mara? MARA LIASSON, NATIONAL POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, NATIONAL PUBLIC RADIO: I think, first, Republicans have to get their ducks in order. Do they want a payroll tax cut in there? How much money, do they want any money for cities and states? How much money do they want to put in for testing? There was a lot of back-and-forth about whether the White House didn't want initial money. They felt there was some unspent funds on testing. Today the president seemed open to it. So once the Republicans figure out what they want, then they can go to conference with the House, which has a much, much more expensive bill. But the point is that we are running out of time. At the end of this month is when those supplemental unemployment benefits run out. There are people in states all over the country where the eviction bans are going to end soon, and the economy is not getting better right now, and Congress really needs to act, and they need to act fast. BAIER: And Guy, the unemployment benefits are a real question, too. A little disparity inside the administration whether to continue this $600 plus in addition to what you would be getting over and above. The president address that, saying maybe it would be a percentage, scale it back, but it seems like there is some negotiation ongoing. BENSON: Yes, because there is a very real concern that there are a lot of members of the workforce that are getting paid more not to work, so there's not an incentive to go back to work, which is obviously perverse. That's not the way it should work. But there are people who do need additional help. So the president dodged the question, what would he accept. Is it $600, could it be $300, could they meet in the middle? I think that's what's going to get hashed out in the Senate. I will say just briefly, Bret, the soundbite that you played from Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader in the Senate, was borderline delusional about his recollection of recent history, the dithering from the Republicans. The Republicans led in the Senate on this issue. The Democrats were part of that whole conversation. Then the Democrats themselves decided to slam the brakes on the entire process on the CARES act because Nancy Pelosi thought it wasn't leftwing enough. And they delayed that whole process twice by a span of days. So I know Schumer might be trying to rewrite recent history, but it's very recent, and I think a lot of people, at least who pay attention, should be able to remember. BAIER: Yes, that's a good point. Kimberley, that really is potentially the sticking point as you get one of these massive bills, that other things that are not related to coronavirus end of being attached like Christmas ornaments. STRASSEL: Yes, and that's the argument that you're seeing play out behind the scenes with Republicans, between those who really want a bill that's very laser-like focused on how do you reopen the economy, how do you aid in that, how to get people back to work, how do you help schools get back functioning, how do you make sure people have personal protective equipment, et cetera, and those who see this bill is an opportunity to get some credit in an election season to look like generous in the handouts and to all the special interests. And so that's the dynamic you're going to see playing out in this bill. It's no question the Republican bill is going to be much smaller in the price tag of what comes out of the House. The question is how much extra is larded in there that not only doesn't really help the economy but potentially even makes things worse. BAIER: Sometimes Congress operates on cliffs. They see a cliff coming and they go right up to it. BENSON: Sometimes? BAIER: It seems like we're headed that way. We'll see. LIASSON: We got one now. BAIER: Yes. Next up, the panel on the Peter Strzok emails and what's the latest with that investigation. But as we go to break, 1988, Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis, a big lead in the polls that year. Just a look back, Dukakis had a 17-point lead when he was nominated. He ended up losing to George H.W. Bush, a massive electoral landslide in that election. Thirty-two years ago tonight, he accepted the nomination in the Democratic Convention. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MICHAEL DUKAKIS, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Tonight, with the wind at our backs, with friends at our sides, and with courage in our hearts, the race to the finish line begins. And we're going to win this race. We're going to win this race. (END VIDEO CLIP) (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: If you knew back then when you are in charge of the investigation and you saw those texts between Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, the level of animus they had against President Trump, what would you have done? JAMES COMEY, FORMER FBI DIRECTOR: I'd have removed both of them from any contact with significant investigations. BAIER: So shouldn't their -- COMEY: Including those involving anybody connected to President Trump, but beyond that. BAIER: So should their work product then be questioned? COMEY: Sure. It's a reasonable question to ask. They were badmouthing everybody, including the candidate Trump. (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: James Comey, former head of the FBI back in April of 2018 talking about Peter Strzok. Now just piece this together. \"The New York Times\" writes an article headline that says \"Trump campaign aides had repeated contacts with Russian intelligence.\" On that same day, February 14th, 2017, Peter Strzok's notes just released, \"We have not seen any evidence of any individuals affiliated with the Trump team in contact with IOs,\" intelligence officers. \"Again, we are on unaware of any Trump advisors engaging in conversations with Russian intelligence officers.\" He goes on to say \"Recent interviews and investigation reveal Steele,\" Christopher Steele, \"may not be in a position to judge the reliability of his subsource network.\" That is from the dossier that became the focus, really, of a lot of this, including a FISA request. We're back with the panel. Kimberley, try to put this in perspective for people who maybe don't understand what the significance of all this is. STRASSEL: So look at the timeframe here, that \"New York Times\" story and those Peter Strzok notes come about in February. The note that he mentioned about Christopher Steele may not having a reliable network comes from a month before in which the FBI had interviewed the main person Christopher Steele got all of his information from that were the basis of the allegations in the dossier. So this means in January and February of 2017, as the Trump administration is coming in, the FBI is already aware that the dossier is nonsense, that they have nothing, that the main source acknowledged that it was rumor and speculation that he had passed on. And you have one of the lead investigators in that case acknowledging that fact in a document and also saying that the FBI has no evidence of interaction between the Trump campaign and Russian intelligence or officers. So the question becomes, why did this continue? How did it go to the degree you ended up having Bob Mueller appointed as Special Counsel? And how on earth could the FBI justify continued surveillance of Carter Page, which continued to be based on the dossier they knew to be untrue? BAIER: Andy McCarthy puts it this way in \"The New York Post,\" \"How much wasted time on pointless investigations could've been prevented had Peter Strzok said this publicly one month into President Trump's term? The narrative of Trump collusion with Russian was pure fiction. The public officials who peddled it to a voracious anti-Trump press had to know it was bunk. Yet they fed the beast anyway. It is a shocking black eye for American law enforcement and intelligence agencies.\" Mara, does this factor in if we don't get this completed Durham report pretty soon? LIASSON: I think we will get a Durham report, and this is probably something that he's going to make part of his report. But the question is, if you believe that the Mueller investigation was based solely on Peter Strzok's work and on the dossier, this is very damning. Now, the Mueller report still concluded that it could not find evidence of criminal wrongdoing in terms of conspiracy with Russia, but it found Russia did interfere, that Donald Trump welcomed the help, and took various measures to try to cover up his campaign's contacts with Russians, maybe not Russian intelligence officials. So those findings are still true. Whether the Senate investigation can continue to come up with things that undermine the basic premise that lead to a conclusion that the investigation, Mueller's investigations should never have been begun, that remains to be seen. BAIER: Yes. I think there's a lot of questions here that we have yet to answer. Here is Senator Lindsey Graham. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM, (R-SC) SENATE FOREIGN RELATIONS COMMITTEE: How could it be that they continued to use the dossier in April and June of 2017 knowing that in January the dossier was completely discredited by the person who put it together? Here's the question for me. Did the intel analyst who wrote the memo tell anybody up the chain, oh, by the way, our case just fell apart. I find it almost impossible to believe that the senior people at the FBI were not told that in January, 2017, the case fell apart against Carter Page. (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: Now, Guy, we are literally the only network covering any of this because it's just nowhere, even though think about how much oxygen was spent covering Russia and collusion for years and years. BENSON: That's exactly the point I was going to make. Three years this was a singular obsession among many in the media. Bombshell-o'clock almost every night, every twist and turn. And now it's kind of unraveling in a very serious way, and these developments are nowhere, crickets among many of our competitors. And I think that is very revealing. BAIER: It is very revealing. We'll continue to cover it, and we will see if the Durham report comes out. And Kimberley, you think it well? STRASSEL: Yes, I do think it will. But watch more immediately for there to maybe be some indictments. That's really what he's there to do. BAIER: Yes, and whether a grand jury is involved. We'll follow all of it. Panel, as always, thank you. When we come back, the brighter side of things, some good news. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BAIER: Finally tonight, a few acts of kindness. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I don't know what else to say other than you are angels. (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: Christina Reynolds was robbed of her rent money at a Glendale, Arizona, gas station. Officers who responded didn't catch the guy yet, but they did collect enough money to not only help Christina pay her rent, they gave Christina gift cards to help her with groceries. Police officers doing great things. And workers at a company in Tennessee went the extra mile to surprise a new dog owner. Top This Construction company teamed up with an animal shelter to pay for a dog's adoption fees. Staff at the shelter surprised the owner with the good news when she arrived to meet a new friend. It's just good things, we can do them. I'll speak with Dr. Deborah Birx -- reminder, tomorrow here on SPECIAL REPORT about all things coronavirus. That's it for SPECIAL REPORT. Fair, balanced, and unafraid. Here's Martha Hey, Martha.

This is THE STORY as it plays out tonight across America. President Trump's first term candid by calling out carnage in America.Here he is today with a search of federal law enforcement officers that will go to Chicago and Albuquerque. For now, perhaps more places later followed by the words of two Americans who lost innocent loved ones to this violence.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: No mother should ever have to cradle her dead child in her arms because politicians refused to do what is necessary. For this reason today I am announcing that the Department of Justice will immediately search federal law enforcement officers to the City of Chicago.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Children are to be our future. And my 4-year-old son didn't make it to kindergarten. I stand here today as a mother fighting against violence for my son.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Every time I go to bed. Every time I go out into the driveway that memory comes back and it haunts me.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: Those stories were hunting today at the White House. The President pushing this effort hearkens back to what some talked about in his inaugural address has a dark side of America. Remember this?(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: Americans want great schools for their children, safe neighborhoods for their families, crime and the gangs and the drugs that have stolen too many lives and rob their country of so much unrealized potential. This American carnage stops right here and stops right now!(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: So now on the cusp of a new election and a new wave of carnage that followed an economic search, flattened by the virus, economic distress, and now civil unrest. Individuals like this man and woman are making their demands on their government quite clear after they witnessed last night 15 people shot and wounded in their Chicago neighborhood. Listen to their words.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: That was a war out here.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The violence is day in and day out. And it's just unnatural with all of this fighting. It is a war zone. To send in federal troops, because really--(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: He says this is natural this violence, we need more cops and federal troops in Chicago. It's like we are in Iraq or something. Some suggest their problems are not real. But it is all exaggerated for election-year politics.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Sometimes when you analyze his moods and the words he uses and the decisions he makes that we don't look at it as a play for vote. Per se it might be. But it also might be a play to just not leave. It is something that a lot of people who know more about the rise of authoritarianism and things like it or looking at when it comes to this Presidency.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: And the New York Mayor writes to the Attorney General who laid out his battle plan for Urban America Today against the crimes. He said we do not consent do not sent the proposed agent. They have proved to bring way more harm than good.In less than four months from Americans across this country will weigh in and they all of you, will decide on the next President. So tonight we talked to Raymond Lopez a Democrat Chicago Alderman and Gary McCarthy the Former Superintendent of Chicago Police who will react to this new plan.We began tonight with Mr. Lopez. Thank you very much, sir, it is good to have you with us this evening. And I want to start by playing this sound bite today from Mayor Lightfoot who you have had a number of run-ins with. Here was her reaction to the plan.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MAYOR LORILIGHTFOOT, D-CHICAGO: That's not democracy that we saw unfolding on the streets of Portland as a result of this federal action. That is what we call Tierney, a dictatorship. And we are not having it in Chicago.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: What did you think when you heard that?RAYMOND LOPEZ, D-CHICAGO 15TH WARD ALDERMAN: No, it is unfortunate because the Mayor has been going back-and-forth with the President who in order to be perfectly honest, I don't agree on many of his policies.But protecting our citizen should not be a part of partisanship. As a Democrat, seeing my residence, seeing my family is gunned down is not a partisan issue. And for her to go weeks on end tweeting back and forth and making all kinds of comments and then finally admitting yesterday that she is - having the FBI, DEA and ATF come in, those comments that she made, how many lives were lost because of the politics of grandstanding in the City of Chicago?MACCALLUM: You know it is interesting. I think a lot of people you first got on the radar when that audio leaked of one of the meetings that you had with the alderman and the Mayor. But what I noticed when I went back and looked at it today, was that you were pretty much right on target about what was about to happen? Let's play that.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)LOPEZ: My fear is once they are done looting and riding and whatever is going to happen tonight, God help us, what happens when they start going after residents? I want an answer. It is not something you ignore. This is a question that I have.LIGHTFOOT: I think you are honestly full of - is what I think.LOPEZ: No offense but--(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: Wow, you know, I don't know what is going on between you two, but why is she so upset when it is suggested that something should be done to make the cities, streets safer in Chicago?LOPEZ: Well, I think part of the problem that the Mayor has with me is that I run contradictory to the narrative that she keeps trying to portray that she is in charge and she is in command of the COVID situation, the violence, when it is clearly obvious not only to the residents of Chicago and not only myself and I'm sure the Former Superintendent and the entire nation that our city is in chaos and in turmoil.When I can tell the Mayor that, I have addressed these issues in my ward. My ward is like the micro - of the City of Chicago we have poverty, we have working class people, we have gangs, we have violence.We were able to make significant gains in reducing those crimes that's year after year prior to this administration. You know, that message hurts her image. It hurts her personally because it is her micromanaging style. Unfortunately that level of pettiness is causing disaster in the City of Chicago right now.MACCALLUM: So, we have pictures of - you had your home was broken into, attacked, your office was also had shattered windows and glass. So you have been on the front line in this. But you are a Democrat. She is a Democrat. Who characterizes better where the people of Chicago are on this if that is an assessment that can be made?LOPEZ: Well, I think you know obviously we're City of Democrats but we're a city of different kinds of Democrats. I'm more of a middle-of-the-road kind of Democrat who believes that we can't have social justice. We can't have good relations with police and we can't have good safety all in the same city.It is possible and we've done it in my ward. Unfortunately, too many politicians in my city and across this nation find it easier to pander to the lowest common denominator in our society as opposed to challenging people to believe and inspire for something greater.And I, for one, know that can happen in our city again. We just have to start enforcing laws targeting individuals who will not change helping those people who want to change and knowing we can do better moving forward.MACCALLUM: That is pretty reasonable message. Alderman Lopez, we thank you very much for coming on tonight. Good to speak to you, sir.LOPEZ: Thank you Martha.MACCALLUM: So joining me now Gary McCarthy he Former Superintendent of the Chicago Police Department. Gary, good to have you with us again, what did you make of this announcement from the Attorney General Bill Barr and the Acting Homeland Security Director and the President today on what their plan is for your city?GARY MCCARTHY, FORMER CHICAGO POLICE DEPARTMENT SUPERINTENDENT: Listen having been through this a number of times, in New York, we had a search with ATF and we had enormous success. In Newark, we had a search with both DEA and the FBI and not only do we make a lot more good drug arrest that made a difference on the street, but the FBI worked with us on a corruption investigations.And then in Chicago, again, the ATF and the U.S. Marshals Service had a search with us. Again, it contributed to us getting to 50 year lows in the murder rate and in 2013-2014. I think it is a very myopic view. There is a lot of political saber raveling that's going on.If you snipe at the President in Chicago, you get political points for that. I'm sure the President gets points across the country for sniping. And this is happening in Chicago. So the law enforcement gets caught in the middle and so does the--MACCALLUM: You know, with regard to what has been said about this, one of the things that doesn't get talked about a lot is gang violence nature of this. And I wonder if you think as someone who has overseen and worked in several cities as you just pointed out, is the protest and everything that is going on tonight that we have seen over the past few months, does that pull police's attention away and allow the gangs to operate with a little bit more freedom?MCCARTHY: Yes, probably the case, Martha, but there is a much bigger dynamic that's going on for years now when I talk about this frequently. Ever since Ferguson, the police have been on the hills, they have been hamstrung and criminals have been involved in.And here in Chicago, we're seeing exponentially getting worse on a daily basis. Police officers are devastated. They are afraid to do their jobs because they're getting attacked physically emotionally and politically on a daily basis. Excuse me. So yes, there is a lot of that going on but it is a much bigger issue. This is happening across country.MACCALLUM: Chad Wolf was on this program last night and here is part of what he said.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CHAD WOLF, ACTING HOMELAND SECURITY SECRETARY: And so the department because we don't have that local support, that local law enforcement support, we're having to go out and proactively arrest individuals. We need to do that because we need to hold them accountable.This idea that they can attack that old property and law officers and go to the other side of the street and say you can't touch me is ridiculous. We don't do that in any other type of law enforcement.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: You have been now critical about some of what has happened in Portland with these officers in camera, right?MCCARTHY: Absolutely. And again, back to Ferguson, I think I coined the phrase that the police can turn a demonstration into a riot. That is what we did in Ferguson, you know it puts a lot of officers on the front line, confrontation gets met with confrontation.And going back to the 2012 NATO Summit here in Chicago where my executive staff was a guest. When I said that we're going to come out with - and the regular Chicago Police Uniform, they expected to go right into riot gear. And I said well, if you want to have a riot, let's make sure we do that. And the tactics that we used in Portland, very critical of, as far as the search goes--MACCALLUM: But look, I just want to put the video up Gary of what happened on Friday night while you finish your thought here because this is what's in people's minds when they think about the attacks on these police officers.MCCARTHY: Oh, yes, Martha - let's not - let's not confuse ourselves with the issues of not being ready to respond to violence. You know, as I have been saying, you can start out with a soft look but by the same token, you have to be ready to go to battle gear immediately.We need to have those mobile forces ready in riot gear. I'm talking about what we call a - with chest protectors not just uniforms. And I'm tired of listening to people talk about the police being in riot gear when they are wearing a helmet.Every police officer in the United States has a helmet and you use it when you need it. That is different than having a mobile task force that has been trained and worked to extract individuals from crowds who are the agitators, which is going to prevent the next incident from happening.MACCALLUM: Tough times, Gary McCarthy, thank you very much. We will see how this works out and always a pleasure to talk to you too. Thank you very much. So coming up a new report that is just in on what was really going on inside that Chinese Consulate in Houston, brand-new details moments ago, Senator Josh Hawley will respond coming out.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)MACCALLUM: Brand-new reports tonight on what's really going on inside that Chinese Consulate in Houston. Just hours after the U.S. Department ordered it shut down. We saw documents being burned in the courtyard there. Look at that fire there as it lights up in the Houston last night.NBC News is now reporting that this was a base that was used for spying operations on major U.S. industries, including medical research, oil, natural gas. The FBI was aware of this. They had briefed the President on this. And one thing is clear now, we are, it looks like in terms of our two countries and the relationship, quite a long ways from this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Does this change how you feel about President Xi? Is it a change in relationship with him?TRUMP: Look, I finished a trade deal that everybody said it would be impossible to get and not only was a trade deal it a great deal for this country. That was done months before the virus came. I am not going to say anything. I had a very good relationship. He is a strong man. He is a tough man, but I have very good relationship with him.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: It appears at this point to be strange, post-virus and that once promising trade deal now appear to be very much on the back burner. Here is the Secretary of State Mike Pompeo earlier today, watch this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MIKE POMPEO, SECRETARY OF STATE: President Trump has had enough. We are not going to allow this to continue to happen. We are setting up clear expectations how the Chinese Communist Party is going to behave? And when they don't, we're going to take actions to protect the American people, protect our security, our national security and also protect our economy and jobs.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: Republican Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri joins me now, Senator good to have you with us tonight. I guess my question is big picture, right? Are we going to look back on this data point of the closing of this Embassy and the burning of those documents has sort of a flash point of an escalation that leads to ultimately either a cold war or God forbid, a hard war with China over of course the next several years?SEN. JOSH HAWLEY, R-MO.: Well part of standing up to China now, Martha, is to prevent a hot war with them that certainly not what we want but we also can't be pushed around. And look we should be clear about the fact that China is an imperial power that they want to extend their power all around the world.And there is one nation in particular that stands between them and world domination and that is us. We're not going to be pushed around anymore. Today's action with the Consulate I think sends a clear signal to Beijing we're not going to tolerate their spying, we're not going to tolerate their espionage. We're not going to tolerate their breaking of the United States law. We're going to get tough it's about time.MACCALLUM: All right, they're working on a trade deal with EU. They have one relationship in Latin America and Africa. They're clearly sort of lining themselves up to be the next world dominant power which has been their desire for quite some time. How do we stop that?HAWLEY: Well, we stop it by doing what we did today, which is to stand up to them when they cheat, when they lie, it's also to expose their lies globally. For instance what they have lied about all the lies they told with COVID-19, trying to blame the origins of the virus on United States soldiers were having sick, total lie.That's why I've called for an international commission led by the United States to actually get the evidence to make China pay for what they have done to get reparations. But the truth is, Martha that they are on the back put the Chinese government is. You now have our allies waking up to the fact that UK is kicking out.Huawei the Chinese Telecom companies kicking out of United Kingdom. We've already taken those actions. China is in trouble here and they know that. That is why they are trying to double down. This is a moment where we have got to stand firm and say that we will not be pushed around. We will stand up for our people.MACCALLUM: Yes, here is the Former Vice President Joe Biden running for President, of course, on this topic, watch this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOE BIDEN, D-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Look what he's doing now? He's blaming everything on China. He's blaming everything on the Chinese and people don't make mistakes. As you well know from South Korean and someone from Beijing, they make no distinction, it is Asia. That is the way, he is just using it as a wedge, and he's trying to shift the blame.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: Your thoughts.HAWLEY: You know Vice President Biden has long been at China appeaser. He's long been an appeaser of authoritarian to Beijing. Just earlier this year, he was talking about how China didn't pose a real threat to the United States, I mean, oops, that is not exactly the story of 2020.We have seen this year what a threat China is to the world. So the Vice President, I think, is radically out of touch with reality on this as so many issues. But it is dangerous him being this out of touch on China. We need somebody, we need leadership that's going to stand up and be strong on China, be strong for American workers, be strong for American security.MACCALLUM: I just want to play this video. This is 2019 drone video that appears to show blindfolded Uighurs being transported according to one report, from one concentration camp to another. And this is an interview that Bill Hemmer did earlier today with the daughter of someone who is being held in one of these camps. This is really scary video. Listen to her.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JEWHER ILHAM, DAUGHTER OF IMPRISONED UIGHUR: My father is not the only person who is in prison. There are thousands of hundreds of Uighurs just like my father are locked up in a prison or concentration camp.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: Her father is a very well-known Economist in China. What do you think when you see that video, and does it change our relationship even more?HAWLEY: Should change our relationship. It should also inspire us to stand up and hold accountable those American, multinational corporations that have shipped our jobs over to China that are now using these Uighur concentration camps. That is what they are; they are concentration camps using them for cheap labor.That is one of the reasons Martha, I've launched this campaign called \"Slave Free\", #SLAVEFREE and I'm challenging all of these American multinationals beginning with the NBA, NIKE and others that make their products in China that use slave labor to pledge that they will be slave free. And I've introduced legislation to make sure it happens.MACCALLUM: I did read that the NBA is not practicing at one of their training camps in Xingjian anymore, small move but a step in the right direction?HAWLEY: Well, here is what it would be a real step and would show real progress. Are they willing to actually say that they will not make any NBA apparel in China with forced labor? Are they willing to take the pledge that the league does not rely on slave labor for any of its products? Is Lebron James willing to take the pledge that his NIKE products don't rely on slave labor? That come I think, which showed true progress.MACCALLUM: It would show that human rights are an issue, a universal issue that hold true. For these individuals who are obviously you know feel very strongly about human rights in this country. Senator Hawley, thank you good to see you tonight.HAWLEY: Thank you.MACCALLUM: So we're going to dig further into this issue with China because there is a lot of discussion about where our two countries are headed that will probably characterize the next decade of geopolitics.I will speak with the Secretary of State tomorrow night. Please tune in for that. Also up next, as Mayor De Blasio and the Teachers' Unions say there is not enough money to get ready to open the public school in the United States. They are refusing to let charter school students back into the classroom, despite their pleas to get back to work and hit the books early in August. That is next.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Regarding the children and your family, your son and grandchildren come are you comfortable and do you plan to have them back in person in school?TRUMP: Yes, I am comfortable with that.(END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: The radicals want to abolish charter schools and eliminate school choice. I want to expand school choice and every family in America should have that option.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: So as many public schools look forward - look toward learning from home, leaving some parents looking for alternatives. Charter schools are private or catholic schools for this fall, New York City's largest charter school network known as \"Success Academy\" was set to begin their 47 schools in just a few weeks.They always begin on the third week of August in order to get a jump on the school year. But now the mayor says that they can't enter the building that they share space with, with public schools.In an op-ed, Jason Riley writes, in many cases, inner city charter schools' students are outperforming their peers in the wealthiest and whitest suburban school districts in the country. In New York City, for example, the Success Academy charter school have effectively closed the academic achievement gap between black and white students.Success Academy CEO Eva Moskowitz joins me now. Eva, good to have you back on the program tonight. So, you had planned to put 20,000 mostly -- mostly black Latino students. I think the majority are in New York City back into the classroom on August 20th. Why can't that happen?EVA MOSKOWITZ, CEO, SUCCESS ACADEMY: Well, actually the high schoolers were supposed to start on the 4th of August. The mayor of New York would not give up access. And while we're largely free from government, but not in terms of the buildings. We are co-located, and we need the mayor to allow us to enter.And so, we are going to -- we're not whiners. We're going to make lemonade out of lemons. We've done remote learning in the spring. And we are going to offer our kids and families a world-class education remotely until we can open.We have a one-to-one program so all of our kids have devices, tablets with their touch screen. And for the older ones, a laptop. And we're going to make it work.MACCALLUM: Yes. And these are publicly funded schools. And you are making it work. You've got, everybody has got a device, as you say. What's your biggest fear, your biggest concern about these kids not being able to get into the classroom as planned?MOSKOWITZ: Well, in person learning is better. Schools, our communities, for the little ones imagine starting kindergarten and you've never been in your classroom. And you get an e-mail address, and you've to do everything in the rectangular box. It's not totally normal if you can say that.MACCALLUM: Yes, not at all.MOSKOWITZ: But we are going to make it work. We taught every child to read in the spring remotely. We did world history. We did calculus. All of the kids took their A.P.'s online.MACCALLUM: Yes, it's remarkable.MOSKOWITZ: And again, in the building we will make it work.MACCALLUM: I'm sure you will. You don't have a date for when you're going to be back in the classroom, right? You are waiting for New York?MOSKOWITZ: We're waiting for government.MACCALLUM: How many -- do you have -- how many kids are on a wait-list to get into your schools? And have you seen an increase in interest in switching over to your schools?MOSKOWITZ: We have over 15,000 parents on the wait list. It's one of the saddest things ever. We only have room for about 2,700 children. And actually, the poor performance of the district, you know you sent out links and worksheets, not relate teaching has meant that our demand has actually gone up.MACCALLUM: Worse, yes. Is the union playing a role in not getting back to school?MOSKOWITZ: Well, I just think it's a paralysis of government, you know, as a charter, a charter network. We're very agile --MACCALLUM: Absolutely.MOSKOWITZ: -- and nimble because we have some basic freedom.MACCALLUM: Yes. Eva Moskowitz, thank you. Great to see you tonight.MOSKOWITZ: Thank you, Martha.MACCALLUM: Good luck to you. Keep us posted.MOSKOWITZ: Thank you so much.MACCALLUM: Coming up, The New York Times out with a scathing piece on one of its former employees, Alex Berenson, accusing him of downplaying the severity of COVID-19 and cherry picking his facts. Tonight, he will respond here live to those allegations for the very first time on THE STORY, next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)MACCALLUM: New York times railing against one of its former reporters, Alex Berenson, over his critical response to government lockdowns and the media's COVID-19 hike. Writing, Mr. Berenson believes that the impact of the coronavirus is regrettable. Mostly inevitable and overstated that lockdowns are useless, masks don't help, and politicians are too worried about the deaths of old people who are going to die soon anyway.Mr. Berenson plays down counterevidence, even when it is first-hand or expert, writes the New York Times.Here now to respond, Alex Berenson, former New York Times reporter and author of \"Unreported Truths About COVID-19 And the Lockdowns.\" Alex, good to see you tonight.ALEX BERENSON, FORMER REPORTER, THE NEW YORK TIMES: Hi, Martha.MACCALLUM: Your response to this piece that was written by Ben Smith of the New York Times.BERENSON: Martha, honestly, I'm not really that interested in that piece. I have a lot of work to do writing about what's going -- what's happening now with the lockdowns, what we're doing with masks, you know, what's we're doing with vaccine going forward.There are huge public policy issues here on the table, and I think that that's what we should be focused on it. A number of people have written, you know, pieces about me in the last couple of months because they don't like what I write. I tried to write factual, you know, I tried to link everything to government documents or publish stories or (Inaudible) papers --(CROSSTALK)MACCALLUM: But that's what he's questioning. I mean, he did, he attacked you personally as well. He said you were harried and angry and reveling in the fight. But he also went after you in terms of your sources, saying that you, you know, your writing and your reporting flies in the face of the other wisdom that's out there.BERENSON: I mean -- I mean, so look, that source, that piece is actually better than a couple of the other pieces that has been written. You know, he said I was aggressive. Yes, I'm aggressive. I'm an investigative reporter.Like investigative reporters are aggressive. He said I was tall. Guess what, I'm also tall. I'm tall and I'm aggressive and I'm an investigative reporter.I think what's more interesting here is the way that the Times has sort of turned its guns not just on me but on, you know, on you, on Fox. And there used to be, I think a little bit of a sense in the media. You know, your report the news your way. We'll report the news our way. People can, you know, people can watch both and make decisions.MACCALLUM: Right.BERENSON: If the Times is going to start throwing stones about coronavirus courage, there's a lot -- they've made a lot of mistakes in the last couple of months.MACCALLUM: Yes.BERENSON: And one reason that reporters don't like me and it's not just the Times, is that I call people out on the stakes. And let me just give you one example. The last time or barely a week ago, a couple of reporters for ProPublica, a reporter from ProPublica, an NBC News, which of course your competition, wrote a story that was headlined all the hospitals in Houston are full.MACCALLUM: Right.BERENSON: All the hospitals in Houston are nowhere near full. There are 2,500 empty beds in Houston hospitals right now. That story was what I call panic porn.MACCALLUM: Yes.BERENSON: It was deliberately or not. It was an effort it fermented panic and that is wrong.MACCALLUM: Yes.BERENSON: And I'm going to call that out on Twitter. I'm going to call that out on your airwaves, I don't care if my friends in the media don't like me anymore because of it.MACCALLUM: You know, I mean, good for you. And as far as we're -- you know, we're used to it. We get it all the time. So, and we don't care either. So that makes two of us.But, you know, in terms of like the Houston story, for example. And when I say to people, you know, there was never a ventilator shortage in the United States. There's a lot of people who are shocked to hear that. Because people think that people were --BERENSON: That's right.MACCALLUM: -- you know, turned away because they, you know, they died because they couldn't get a ventilator. And you know, a lot of these things that become just sort of common understandings that simply are not true, which is obviously very dangerous here.But I do want to ask you about what Scott Gottlieb said today. Just in terms of the numbers. Because I want to match what you're seeing with what he is seeing. Let's play that.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SCOTT GOTTLIEB, FORMER COMMISSIONER, FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION: In the United States, probably, you know, by the end of the year we could have upwards of 300,000 if we continue on the current trajectory. Right now, we are close to 1,000 casualties a day.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: So, that's a big number, a 1,000 a day. And he says that if we stay on the current trajectory, we could get to 300,000. Does your reporting suggest that that is where we're headed here?BERENSON: Well, I mean, I think it's too early to tell. OK? You know, in the first and someone with unreported truths which Ben Smith actually mentioned in the Times piece, I said that a worst-case scenario here you could have up to 600,000 deaths.Most of those deaths if you look at who is dying occur in people who probably would have died by the year-end anyway. And 600,000 might be over two-year period. But could we get to 300,000? I'm not saying that's not impossible.Here's what I think people need to think about. When scenarios for like influenza pandemics were discussed in the last 15 years, the CDC, the WHO, they talked about in some cases more than two million Americans dying. And even then, they didn't think that mass lockdowns were a good idea.I'm not saying that 300,000 deaths is anything to take lightly.MACCALLUM: Yes.BERENSON: I'm not saying it doesn't mean we shouldn't stand up to hospitals and the nursing homes, but even if we get there, we have to think about the harm that lockdowns do economically, societally, socially, educationally.MACCALLUM: Yes.BERENSON: And I don't think it makes me a bad person or lacking empathy as Ben Smith also said, to think that maybe we should think about children and how and what we're doing is affecting them too.MACCALLUM: Alex, thank you. Alex Berenson always good to talk to you.BERENSON: Thanks.MACCALLUM: We'll see you soon.BERENSON: Thanks, Martha.MACCALLUM: All right. So, the Trump campaign respond to Joe Biden calling the president a racist today, earlier today. We'll talk about that when we come back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: My vision for American cities could not be more different from the lawlessness being pushed by the extreme radical left.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: As President Trump positions himself as the law and order candidate, his campaign has spent millions of dollars on this message.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The radical left-wing march agenda take over our cities, defund the police, pressure more towns to follow, and Joe Biden stands with them.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: That ad comes as the former vice president walks a delicate line, pushing for calm and violence ridden cities, appealing to black voters, and assuring that he can reform policing while also being tough on crime.Trump 2020 communications director Tim Murtaugh joins us in moments. But first, Jennifer Palmieri, former communications director for Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign and author of \"She Proclaims: Our Declaration of Independence from a Man's World.\"Jennifer, good to have you here tonight. Thank you for being here.JENNIFER PALMIERI, FORMER COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR, OBAMA AND CLINTON CAMPAIGN: Thanks, Martha.MACCALLUM: What is your reaction to that? Do you see this as, you know, an agenda that is framed at scaring people?PALMIERI: I do. I do fear of that. You know, it's regrettable, but I do fear that that's what the president is doing. It's interesting. I think that he is trying to, he's trying to strike fear in the hearts of some Americans and then at the same time, I see him trying to reach out to some black Americans.I notice today at the end of his press conference, he talked about how, in his opinion, I don't agree, he's done more for African-Americans than any other president. You know, alongside the times when the Trump campaign has run into ads that you talked about, they're also, I know they're also running ads targeted at trying to reach black voters too.MACCALLUM: Yes.PALMIERI: So, I think there it's a -- it's a -- it's a divide and conquer kind of strategy.MACCALLUM: So, I want to play what Joe Biden said about the president that prompted the response that you just mentioned.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BIDEN: He's spreading of racism, the way he deals with people --UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes.BIDEN: -- based on the color of their skin, their national origin, where they are from, is absolutely sickening. No sitting president has ever done this. Never, never, never. No Republican president has done this. No Democratic president. We've had racists and they've existed. They've tried to get elected as president. He's the first one that has.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: He said the president is racist. The first president in the country's history who is racist. To which the president answered with his response on the economy, prison reform, a number of things that he says a lot of other presidents have tried to do but never accomplished. Is that OK for this candidate, Biden, to call the sitting President of the United States a racist?PALMIERI: I think so in this case. I'm not sure that you and I will agree on this, but I do believe, Vice President Biden is right. The president very regrettable uses racism and fear to divide the country. And I think he does it to scare people.(CROSSTALK)MACCALLUM: Can you give me an example of that of how he's --(CROSSTALK)PALMIERI: The caravan that never -- the caravan that never materialized that he said would, I think to try to motivate people to turn out to vote - -(CROSSTALK)MACCALLUM: There were lots of people that were coming across the border, and they camped out south of the border for months.PALMIERI: Using the bible to, you know, the -- when he went to the church after tear gassing protesters at the Lafayette Square.MACCALLUM: How is that racist?PALMIERI: To suggest that people who protest don't believe in God, I think. I think it's using --(CROSSTALK)MACCALLUM: I think it was because they had burned the part of the church the night before.PALMIERI: It's using the issue to try to divide people. I think, you know, that's the problem. That's what I've never seen a Republican president in my lifetime who is doing this --(CROSSTALK)MACCALLUM: All I'm saying is -- all I'm saying is that if you are going to call someone a racist you better have some very concrete examples of how they are. It's one of the most serious things that you could call someone in the United States of America.PALMIERI: I think --(CROSSTALK)MACCALLUM: And obviously, this is a president who uses very strong language about people on his own, it's usually based on the individual rather than, you know, I see it based on the individual. And he is free with his criticism, there is no doubt about that.PALMIERI: He started his -- he started his campaign saying a lot of rapist -- Mexicans are racist and criminals. You know, he started his campaign with that. Throughout his campaign he has used race to divide and to scare people.MACCALLUM: All right. Let me just ask you one other thing with regard to your book. \"She Proclaims: Our Declaration of Independence from a Man's World.\" You wrote about the incident between AOC and Ted Yoho who called her very nasty names, including the f word and the b word. What is that incident reveal to you?PALMIERI: I actually think, you know, it does not, I mean, obviously, she should not have been subjected to that.MACCALLUM: Yes.PALMIERI: But my point of the piece was she was very able to deal with it. Right? I think that women, you know, what I want the women watching to know is I think all of us have experienced -- I never thought of myself as somebody as a woman working in the men's world. I just thought it was the world and I was doing great in it.And at some point, you realize that we're not making progress. We're not breaking through. I worked as hard as the men and yet the men I worked with even though they were really good colleagues to me and really supportive of me, grow as faster than I did.And I had the epiphany that I'm not doing great in a men's world. I'm doing great making it run and making it run well for them, sort of perpetuating these systems.And the point of the book is to say, like what's in your own mind that you can change to get yourself out of that rut? And I think Ocasio-Cortez with how she handled the situation with Yoho is a pretty good example of that.MACCALLUM: Very interesting. OK. Jennifer, thank you very much. Good to have you here. I hope you'll come back and we'll talk more about the election as it moves forward. It's going to be a feisty one. I know you always bring a lot to the table, so I'm glad you're here. Thank you.PALMIERI: Thanks, Martha.MACCALLUM: So, also here tonight, Trump 2020 communications director Tim Murtaugh. Tim, thank you for being here as well. Your thoughts on Joe Biden saying that President Trump is the first racist president in this country, which as I said, is an extremely serious thing to level at any one.TIM MURTAUGH, TRUMP 2020 COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR: It is. And it's ridiculous. There is a reason why Joe Biden is doing this. And it's because he knows that he's got a really serious problem with black voters in this election.All you have to do is take a look at what Joe Biden is doing. When was the last time, Martha, you can remember that a Democrat presidential campaign in a general election was actually running ads aimed at attracting the support of black voters? It's really unheard of. And the reason he's doing that is because he knows his support among black voters in America is soft. And to get --(CROSSTALK)MACCALLUM: I think we have the numbers here. We can put them up. Tim, sorry to interrupt but he does have a smaller lead with black voters than Hillary Clinton did. She was plus 79, he is plus 75. Obviously. a huge margin but a smaller lead. Go ahead.MURTAUGH: The president -- the president has made great inroads among black voters and among a lot of different voters, Latinos included. And it's because the president has a clear record of support, a clear record of achievement in the black community.Before the coronavirus crisis interrupted the great economy, it was an all- time low unemployment rate for black voters.MACCALLUM: That's true.MURTAUGH: Historic funding for HBCUs, criminal justice reform. Joe Biden, on the other hand is no one to be giving racial justice lectures to. This is a man who has bragged in the past about his great relationships with notorious, racist senators from the past. He bragged about receiving an award for George Wallace.He eulogized the former exalted cyclops of the KKK, Senator Byrd. No one should be listening to a lecture on racial justice from Joe Biden.And it's the president, President Trump who has a great record of achievement on behalf of black voters, and that is something that we are very proud of. Joe Biden, he knows he's got a problem with black voters. That's why he's needing to spend money to advertise to black voters, which Democrat presidential candidates never have to do.MACCALLUM: I think we're all looking forward to these debates. And we hope that they're going to be substantive. But, you know, I think that Joe Biden will have to answer for that charge. And you have to be very specific as I said, it's a very serious charge.Tim Murtaugh, thank you, sir. Good to see you.MURTAUGH: Sure. Thank you, Martha.MACCALLUM: Quick break here. More of \u201cThe Story\u201d when we come back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)MACCALLUM: So that is the story of Wednesday, July the 22nd, 2020. Thanks for being here tonight. As always, the story goes on. So, we'll be right back here tomorrow one-on-one with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, just back from Copenhagen and London. Good night, everybody.

The question fared well in metropolitan areas, including Oklahoma City and Tulsa, but was overwhelmingly opposed in rural counties.Idaho, Maine, Nebraska and Utah have all expanded Medicaid through ballot questions, but did so by amending state statutes, according to the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation.\nAmending the Oklahoma Constitution will prevent the Republican-controlled Legislature, which has resisted Medicaid expansion for a decade, from tinkering with the program or rolling back coverage. Missouri voters also will decide on a constitutional amendment on Aug. 4.State Question 802 will extend Medicaid health insurance to those earning up to 138% of the federal poverty level, which is about $17,200 for an individual or $35,500 for a family of four.Oklahoma was one of 14 states, along with neighboring Texas and Kansas, that had not expanded Medicaid under the 2010 federal Affordable Care Act. Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt and his predecessor, Mary Fallin, have opposed expansion, citing uncertainty about future costs for the state.\u201cWe have a billion-dollar shortfall next year,\" Stitt said recently at a forum hosted by Americans for Prosperity, a conservative political advocacy group that opposes the measure. The state would have to \u201ceither raise taxes or to cut services somewhere else like education, first responders, or roads and bridges\u201d to cut additional Medicaid costs, he said.After years of legislative inaction on health insurance proposals, supporters of Medicaid expansion\u00a0\u00a0last year to get the measure on the ballot, and collected a\u00a0\u00a0of signatures. The plan was endorsed by several politically powerful groups, including chambers of commerce, medical trade groups, the Oklahoma Education Association and the Oklahoma Conference of Churches.Some Republican opposition to Medicaid expansion has eroded in recent years, particularly in rural areas where hospitals have suffered financial problems or closed.Kevin Penry, a Republican and retired pastor from Edmond, said that before going on Medicare last month he had to buy expensive insurance on the federal marketplace, which \u201creally made me feel for folks who are in a difficult financial situation.\" He said he voted for the expansion.The Oklahoma Health Care Authority has projected that about 215,000 residents would qualify for a Medicaid expansion, for a total annual cost of about $1.3 billion. The estimated state share would be about $164 million. But those numbers could be considerably higher given the number of Oklahomans who have lost their jobs and work-related health insurance because of the economic shutdown amid the coronavirus pandemic.To help fund the proposal, the Legislature is expected to increase a fee that hospitals pay from 2.5% to 4%, which would generate about $134 million annually.

I'm Laura Ingraham. This is the \"The Ingraham Angle\" from Washington tonight. Teachers unions are choosing liberal wish lists over educating your kids. Can't be. Well, we'll explain.Also, Donald Trump's niece just published a totally slanderous work impugning the President's psyche, defamatory since it's in writing. A psychologist is here tonight to detail how Mary Trump is guilty of some pretty obvious projection. And a potential scandal is brewing with the counting of positive tests in Florida for COVID, a full report. Plus, we're going to hear from a respected doctor down there with the actual facts.But first, the war against kids. That's the focus of tonight's Angle.Is there anything in the world happening beyond COVID? Well, you'd think not, watching the non-stop fear and panic sold by the media and their Democrat partners 24/7.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: America is the worldwide epicenter for new cases in large part due to Trump's failure.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: --no end in sight. The point is, there is no plan. There is no federal--ANDERSON COOPER, CNN ANCHOR: yes.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: --led effort to bring this back.UNIDENTIFIED MALE (voice-over): What, if anything, can be done to pull the country out of this public health disaster?(END VIDEO CLIP) \u00a0INGRAHAM: Well, they rarely report, of course, that new infections haven't translated into a rising COVID death rate. In fact, the seven-day average COVID deaths has fallen from a peak of 2,232 in mid-April to 724 as of yesterday. That's right. It's a 68 percent decline.Now, there has been a slight uptick in COVID deaths this month, but the death rate is nowhere near where it was back in April. So that's good news in a difficult situation. But they don't just want you living in fear. What they want you to be is demoralized, dumb down, and dependent on the government. Meaning, more PPP, mailbox money instead of actual jobs, and they hope that you're going to be so exhausted from riding this lockdown and reopening roller coaster that you'll trade freedom for a false sense of security. And then it will be on to socialism.Now, in case you've forgotten, freedom includes the right to travel, to gather, to work, to worship, and to attend school. And it is this issue of school reopening where we see exactly what Joe Biden's puppeteers are capable of.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SUSAN RICE, FORMER NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR: We cannot do as the President Trump is doing and play politics with and be willing to sacrifice the lives of our children and their teachers.(END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Let me say this very clearly. They're lying to you when they say it's too dangerous to reopen schools. A new German study, the largest of its kind, confirms what we had learned from Iceland, France, and Scandinavian countries. Now, \"The results show that 'the dynamics of virus spreading have been overestimated,' the universities said\" - that did the study - \"adding that the study suggested that schools did not become the coronavirus hotspot after reopening, as had been feared.\"Now, in case you think this is some small, ridiculous study, a total of 2,045 blood samples from schoolchildren and teachers were taken from 13 secondary schools in Germany. Unlike the U.S., European countries smartly sent their students back to school, and there haven't been any major outbreaks.So, should kids wear masks and social distance in schools? Well, different countries have tried different approaches. It's been different all across the globe. But school districts across America are right now planning very expensive classroom modifications. You've seen a lot of the Plexiglas dividers. Maybe they work, maybe they don't. And parents, in turn, are buying into this freak-out. And in Orange County, where they're bucking the trend in California, some parents are actually upset about the reopening.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: There are so many people who can get sick. And I think it's very dangerous and unacceptable to go back to school right now.CHORUS: Kids' lives matter. Kids' lives matter. Kids' lives matter. Where's your mask? Where's our mask?(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM: OK. They don't know about the science. And the media isn't reporting the science. Very interesting. Don't you think?And oddly, Dr. Fauci isn't talking about that science published by German researchers that we just talked about. Professor Reinhard Berner discovered, quote, \"The majority of schoolchildren did not go through an infection themselves despite an infection in the household. This finding must also be taken into account when it comes to deciding on measures to limit contact.\"Now, if you listen closely to physicians, even far-left outlets like MSNBC occasionally stumble upon the truth. But boy, are they embarrassed by it! \u00a0(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) \u00a0UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Would you let your kids go back to school?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I will. My kids are looking forward to it.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes. Period. Absolutely.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Absolutely. As much as I can.(LAUGHTER) \u00a0UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Without a hesitation?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Without a hesitation, yes.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I have no concerns about sending my child to school in the fall.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I would let my kids go back to school.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Dr. John Torres, NBC News.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: They all said yes.(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM: OK. That's my favorite moment of the day. They ran out of teachers, OK? Or parents or reporters or experts or doctors. But of course, Biden's big allies, the teachers unions, they pay no attention to the doctors or that extensive German study I just talked about. They want their members to stay home and totally ignore what we know about kids' exceedingly low infectivity rates. They ignore the horrific mental and physical health consequences from keeping kids away from school as well.We said this last night. I'm going to repeat it. It's really important. These teachers, just like police and firefighters, they are essential employees. Their salaries are paid by you, the taxpayers. Yet, many are basically refusing to return to work. Now, this is not to say that there are no risks of returning to schools. There are. There may be.The CDC issued its final flu report for the 2019-2020 season. Tragically, 166 children died of the flu nationwide. But schools didn't close, did they? Teachers did not refuse to work. By contrast, the number of children who've died nationwide of COVID is 30 according to provisional CDC data. Now, every life lost is a horrific tragedy. That goes without saying.Now, in California, where teachers unions are pushing to keep your kids at home, guess how many of the state's nearly 9 million schoolchildren have succumbed to COVID. Do you see it in the screen? Zero. That's right. No one under the age of 18 has died from COVID in California according to the stats that we have, the most up-to-date ones.So, thankfully, overwhelmingly, children have been spared. Still, Biden's most ardent supporters, the teachers unions are ratcheting up the fear. And they're even trying to extort concessions that have zero to do with education. The United Teachers Los Angeles Union is demanding the abolishment of charter schools and demanding the defunding of police. Yes, that will keep those kids safe and educated. We'll have more on that in a bit.But here's the bottom line. Schools are where children learn, grow, interact, have fun. It's where they run around, they play sports, and yes, sometimes they get hurt. For some, it's a respite from a turbulent home life. They desperately need this rhythm of school back, this normalcy to return.And economically, our country cannot survive school closures without cataclysmic ripple effects. Parents will suddenly be out of work, and job losses in the education arena will be severe. Children can't be pawns this campaign season. We have to safeguard their physical health but also their long-term development. Keeping them locked in the house attached to screens is going to lead to untold suffering, a toll for them far worse than this virus.And that's The Angle.Joining me now is Georgianna Kelman, L.A. parent and special education attorney; also, Harmeet Dhillon, civil rights attorney and Founder of the Center for American Liberty that is challenging so many of these edicts across the country.Georgianna, let's start with you. You're in the middle of this.GEORGIANNA KELMAN, L.A. SPECIAL EDUCATION ATTORNEY & LOS ANGELES PARENT: I am.INGRAHAM: What's your reaction to the L.A. Unified School District's decision not to reopen this fall for in-class learning?KELMAN: It's a huge, massive mistake that we're going to be paying for, for a long time. And thank you for everything you said because you've articulated everything I wanted to say perfectly. The UTLA (inaudible). I can't tell you how many times called me consistently - teachers called me consistently to tell me they want schools opened.(inaudible) there is the survey that was done for parents and the majority of LAUSD parents want to go back to school. Teachers want to go back to school, but unfortunately, this union is a bully. Teachers are being highly encouraged to vote along with the safe line of thinking that the union - based on their objectives of the union.And I'm here to tell you that it's not true, that the majority of Los Angeles parents want to go back to school. Unfortunately, they don't have a seat at the table. Kids don't have lobbyists. Kids don't have unions speaking on their behalves and speaking the truth. And we're not having a conversation about truly the impact of COVID versus closure.I think the long-term, kids are going to be much more detrimentally impacted, most especially special education children and children in low- income communities due to this closure. I do believe there's an answer. I do believe there's a middle ground that is a hybrid system that can--INGRAHAM: Yes. Yes.KELMAN: --can be implemented, but it's the union that's preventing it.INGRAHAM: Well, I would argue that I'm going to go even further, Harmeet. I think the hybrid system is - it's probably a little bit better, but it's incredibly confusing and upends family life, obviously for working parents, especially.Harmeet, Eric Garcetti, the Mayor of Los Angeles - and it dovetails into this conversation - is already threatening another lockdown. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Do you want to initiate (ph) the mandate on stay-at-home order to return?MAYOR ERIC GARCETTI, D-LOS ANGELES: So - we had a safer-at-home order. As I said even then, not everything was always closed, but yes, if we go to red, that's what we will come. I don't - today - I only know today. Ask me tomorrow. Ask me later this week. But I want everybody to take seriously that we're on the verge of that for sure.(END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Harmeet, is this the MO now every time China releases a virus accidentally? Or people are worried about, I don't know what next, climate change, we're going to do shutdown for a while to save the - I don't know. Is this just what we're going to do forever if the Democrats are in charge?HARMEET DHILLON, CIVIL RIGHTS ATTORNEY: Well, absolutely, Laura. I think that's their MO. By the way, one of the examples would be, is there an election this year. That would be a good reason to terrorize people and shut them down.So Eric Garcetti is speaking the message of his owners and the owners of the Democratic Party in California, which is the California Teachers Union. By far, the most powerful lobbyist, their demands to open the schools in any fashion, even the bastardized hybrid fashion that you just mentioned, Laura, includes Medicare for all, defunding the police, and on and on and on. All kinds of goodies that have nothing to do with educating our children.And Laura, even before this crisis, California was already in a dismal state with regard to literacy. Fewer than 25 percent of our fourth-graders can read properly. And they just settled a suit with the state between literacy activists and the state this year because of the equal protection violations, the fact that students in poor school districts or people of disadvantaged backgrounds--INGRAHAM: Right.DHILLON: --or people from certain English as a second language, what have you, are not getting educated. That's before COVID. Imagine what it's going to be like when they don't have individualized attention, when their individual education plans are not being honored by the state. This is going to cause massive physical harm to students. Schools are the only resort for many families with--INGRAHAM: All right.DHILLON: --with students who may be suffering from different things that are only perceived when they come to school, Laura.INGRAHAM: Well, I'm going to stay on this issue. I think it's the issue affecting all families with children for the foreseeable future. This is the most important issue.Ladies, thank you so much.And as I mentioned earlier, the L.A. teachers union - and Harmeet said - they're making these crisis demands. It's like an ongoing - we're watching it in real-time - attempt at extortion. We won't educate your kids in person unless you give us certain liberal projects like defunding the police. Now, a moratorium on new charter schools can have competition and taxpayer handouts to illegals because we have to welcome more people into the country even though we can't educate the kids that we have.Now, these are runaway unions that are exploiting this tragedy, and they want to see how much power they can grab. Like everybody else knocking down statues, they want to knock down education to try to get more concessions.Joining me now is Rebecca Friedrichs, former California schoolteacher and a union rep. She was also the lead plaintiff in that landmark 2016 Supreme Court case against CNA, NEA and California Teachers Association.Rebecca, I didn't think much of the teachers unions before COVID. And now, I'm frankly disgusted because it's obvious they're putting students last and teachers' union political demands first. Your take?REBECCA FRIEDRICHS, FORMER CA TEACHER FOR 25+ YEARS: I am so thrilled that you feel that way and that you are highlighting this for your viewers. I have been shouting about this for decades. So it is very important that we open our schools. That is true.The unions are using the closure of our schools as a smokescreen. Laura, here's why. Sadly, these unions are actually using our schools to sexualize our children and to train them in anti-American ideology. They do this with the collision of over 180 organizations, including, sadly, the CDC, Planned Parenthood, and Black Lives Matter incorporated.It is shocking what they're teaching our children online through virtual learning. They are teaching our children to sext to view pornography. They are hooking them up with online sex experts. So what they are doing is grooming our children for sexual predators to use them. This is child abuse.I have an editorial about this tomorrow online in \"The Washington Times\". People can read and learn all the details. This is one of the big reasons the unions want to keep our schools closed because they can't sneak these evil lessons past loving teachers who have no idea of keeping them virtual.INGRAHAM: All right. Yes. Rebecca, I remember, a friend of mine living up north of L.A., in the Santa Barbara area, was telling me about the kindergarten living, whatever it's called, human life curriculum. And I know it's repeated throughout other school districts in California. It's way advanced for a kindergartner. And most parents don't even - I don't think - know about it to opt out. And there's a big controversy about whether the kids could opt out or - or they have to opt out or it's automatically happen. So that's the kind of stuff that goes on.And your point is an important one. The unions would rather have teachers at home using these online tools because it's a lot more complicated when you're in class trying to teach this stuff. So you think there's actually the political motive to be at home, not just that they're misstating the science or don't know the science?FRIEDRICHS: Oh, absolutely. And what you also have to know is that the teachers unions, the National Education Association rewrote the scientific method so that this is why we are getting fake science, fake history, fake everything through our schools because it is their goal to destroy our public schools.Look, I think that we could - we have this perfect opportunity right now where we can actually save America's schools and we can save America if we do four things. Number one--(CROSSTALK) \u00a0INGRAHAM: We have to go, Rebecca. Got to--FRIEDRICHS: Oh, thanks.INGRAHAM: Well, we've got - no, we have to say thanks. But four things, are those in your op-ed tomorrow?FRIEDRICHS: No, they're not. We'll have to do another one.(LAUGHTER) INGRAHAM: All right. We'll have you - we'll have you back. Sorry, this is the tyranny of the clock and cable news. Rebecca, we got a lot of--FRIEDRICHS: No problem.INGRAHAM: --information out. Thank you so much.There is a potential scandal brewing in Florida over how hospitals are tracking COVID cases. We're going to tell you about it in moments. Plus, later we speak to a psychiatrist who says Mary Trump's new personal attempt at a takedown of President Trump reveals more about her than the President. She'll explain.(COMMERCIAL BREAK) INGRAHAM: The number of COVID cases in Florida is undoubtedly on the rise, but there's a potentially massive scandal-brewing regarding the way hospitals, labs and others are reporting the percentage of positive test results.Fox affiliate WOFL's Robert Guaderrama has been looking into the story, and he joins us now live from Orlando with the latest breaking details.Robert?ROBERT GUADERRAMA, WOFL-FOX ORLANDO REPORTER: Laura, it takes a lot to surprise a journalist, but I was shocked when I heard this news today. So there's lots of confusion on many levels in reference to Florida's coronavirus numbers. We've got tipped off today - or yesterday that is, that the numbers didn't quite look right on the state's daily case report.So, looking into the breakdown of test labs, I quickly noticed astronomical positivity rates. Now, mind you, Florida's COVID-19 positivity rate is just under 11 percent, but dozens of labs reported as having 100 percent positivity. Some only reporting positive cases. The negative column, completely blank.So I asked myself, how could 100 percent of people testing at those sites test positive? I reached out to several major hospitals in our area. Orlando Health and the Orlando VA confirming errors in their numbers on the report.So, after several requests for comment, today the Florida Department of Health releasing this statement to me, reading in part, \"In recent days, the department noticed that some smaller, private labs weren't reporting negative test result data. The department immediately began working with those labs to ensure that all results were being reported in order to provide comprehensive and transparent data.\"Now, these labs are required by the state to report all test results. But here's something else that adds to the confusion. A spokesperson for Lee Memorial Hospital, that's in the Fort Myers area, tells me that they believe there's a problem in the state's data-gathering system because it is their understanding the negative results from their hospital were in fact submitted.So, Laura, more questions to be answered, but this news coming as so many Floridians are already questioning the numbers being reported by the state.INGRAHAM: Robert, fascinating. Thanks for the great job. We appreciate it.And joining us now is Dr. Charles Lockwood, Dean of the University of South Florida's College of Medicine.Dr. Lockwood, now, before we get into the details of Florida's numbers, your reaction to what was just reported? Labs with 100 percent positivity rates and others who aren't reporting any negatives. How damaging is that to the larger picture?DR. CHARLES LOCKWOOD, USF COLLEGE OF MEDICINE DEAN & USF HEALTH SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT: I am - I'm not totally surprised. On Saturday, the state did 143,000 tests when Governor DeSantis said that we were going to triple testing back in March to 30,000 tests a day, which is what the number was that was recommended by the Harvard Global Health Institute for containment. I mean, people literally laughed.And on Saturday, we did 143,000 tests in one day. So that's a lot of tests that you're going to have some screw-ups when you have that volume of testing going on, but that's pretty disturbing.INGRAHAM: Yes. Well, it doesn't inspire a lot of confidence. Dr. Lockwood, I also want to play some of the media coverage of the Sunshine State's COVID outbreak.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) STEVE KORNACKI, MSNBC NATIONAL POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT: Looking at Florida, we have these surging case counts in Florida, the death tolls rising.UNIDENTIFIED MALE (voice-over): The dire situation in the State of Florida- -UNIDENTIFIED MALE (voice-over): In Miami-Dade County, things are especially dire.STATE REP. SHEVRIN JONES, D-FLA.: What we have right now is a total circus of chaos that's taking place in the State of Florida.(END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Of course, there are rising case numbers. They're concerning. But a lot of folks seem to think Florida is the next New York. Now, tell us why that's absurd, frankly.LOCKWOOD: Well, we're not. I mean, it's pretty clear. Just for one thing, our case fatality rate, that's the number of deaths over the number of cases, is 1.5 percent. New York City, right now, it's 10 percent. So that's a huge difference there.We've had a huge increase in cases. We've had a six-fold increase in cases since June 10th. We've had about three-fold increase in hospitalizations. We've had a little less than that increase in deaths where (inaudible) death is tragic. But day-after-day, week-after-week, we've had a continued drop in our case fatality rate.And there are probably three things that directly impact that. One, we're doing lot more testing. We've blown through all the goals that we had. And we're now, on average, doing about 73 tests a day on a rolling average. So that's pretty accurate.INGRAHAM: Now, Vin Gupta, doctor--(CROSSTALK)LOCKWOOD: Secondly--INGRAHAM: Let me just get to - Dr. Lockwood, I want to just play Vin Gupta from NBC News, just to your first point, said that the death rate itself is not really relevant. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DR. VIN GUPTA, MSNBC MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: The death rate, which we make such a big deal out of, the President has a declining death rate is essentially meaningless. Deaths now are probably the result of infections about a month ago. So we can only - the metrics that matter in real-time are what are the hospitalization rates that we're seeing in places like Florida.(END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Well, does he have any merit to what he said?LOCKWOOD: Yes. Well, a little. Deaths are definitely a lagging indicator. But we should now be seeing a much higher case fatality rate. It's been predicted that our case fatality rate would kind of do a \"U\" and be heading back up. It's not. In fact, today, in Tampa, in Hillsborough County, our case fatality rate was 0.9 percent. That's less than 1 percent. So that's the lowest, I think, in the United States.And every day I wake up, I check the numbers, and it's been dropping. Now, I think it's real. And it reflects doing a lot more cases. We're picking up asymptomatic cases, we're picking up milder cases than we did before. When you test that number of people, thousands and thousands, really - I mean, if you think about it, we're testing - we're approaching 1 percent of the population in Florida being tested every day when you get 142,000 tests.INGRAHAM: All right.LOCKWOOD: (inaudible) population--INGRAHAM: Yes. And so the younger the younger population not dying, thankfully, at the rate their elder counterparts were dying earlier. Dr. Lockwood, there's a lot to unpack here. We want to have you back because clearly this Florida narrative is not going away anytime soon. Thank you so much for going through it with us.And the two questions on many Americans minds right now are this. Where is Congress? And what are they going to do about reopening schools? Congressmen Steve Scalise, Jim Jordan - haven't seen them in a while - they are here with some answers. Stay tuned.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)INGRAHAM: Teachers unions are holding our kids' education hostage, and leading Democrats are there coconspirators.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. NANCY PELOSI, D-CALIF., HOUSE SPEAKER: What we heard from the secretary was malfeasance and dereliction of duty. This is appalling. The president and his administration are messing with the health of our children. Going back to school presents the biggest risk for the spread of the coronavirus.(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM: Biggest risk of spread of bull-you-know-what comes from the woman in yellow. How does the House GOP respond to this? Here now is House Minority Whip Steve Scalise and Congressman Jim Jordan, House Oversight Committee ranking member. Great to see both of you. Congressman Scalise, you were at an event about schools in Baton Rouge today with the vice president and many others. What can Congress do about this? This is a local decision-making process, is it not?REP. STEVE SCALISE, R-LA., HOUSE MINORITY WHIP: Yes, Laura, it's good to be back with you. But Vice President Pence came today, we actually did the event in Tiger Stadium. And we had the president of the LSU system, we had the president of the Southern University system. We had our governor, John Bel Edwards, as well as a number of other educators and members of Vice President Pence's team talking about reopening schools. And we're planning on reopening schools in just a few weeks. And both of the system presidents talked about what they are doing to have kids safely come back to college. I was at a high school earlier today talking about their plans to safely reopen.Look, this is America, Laura. We put a man on the moon. We stormed the beaches of Normandy. We know how to get things done. And these people that are sitting in a room going, oh, gee whiz, we can't do it, that's not the attitude we need right now. The real question should be not whether or not to do it, but how to do it safely, and we can do it safely. And I'm glad that states like mine are moving forward. We need to get every state to do it for the health and benefits of these children that don't need another six months of homeschooling.INGRAHAM: Congressman Jordan, earlier tonight we went through some of the science from Germany, which has done serological testing on children and teachers, thousands and thousands of tests. None of this is been cited by any of the decision-makers showing kids have exceedingly low infectivity rates. So those concerns about infecting the teachers -- they haven't seen it in Europe. They just haven't seen it.REP. JIM JORDAN, R-OHIO, HOUSE OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE: No, the facts and the truth are on our side, Laura. Laura, what's more important, going to school or protesting? What's more important, going to church or protesting? Going to a loved one's funeral or protesting? Or how about this one, what's more important, going to work or protesting? It seems to me that the only thing the Democrats think you can do during COVID is protest, riot, and attack the police and defund the police.But all the -- we have to go back to school. We have to get back to normal. And the facts and the truth are on our side. So let's let local school boards, let's let moms and dads -- I think moms and dads probably know what's best for their kids, local school boards probably know better what's better for kids than Joe Biden in the basement of his house pronouncing these things. So let's let local communities decide this. And as Steve just said, we can do it in a safe way. But Democrats want to make everything critical political. Let's just follow the truth and the facts and let's let kids get back to school and start learning.INGRAHAM: There's a lot of -- there's a lot of -- I would take issue with that a little bit. There are a lot of local school boards that have been completely dominated by the left because --JORDAN: The big city ones, the ones controlled by the Democrats, like L.A., like Mayor Garcetti has done, you're right.INGRAHAM: Arlington County, Virginia. It's Democrat, Arlington County, Virginia, they basically just went to a hybrid system, a couple days a week in school, the rest of it they are going to be at home, or maybe even all online learning. Montgomery County, all online learning. Congressman Scalise, I'm telling conservatives, you want to have an effect, start running in these local elections. That's what you have to do, because these superintendents are just taking their orders from the teachers union. These people but the word \"doctor\" in front of their names. Go ahead.SCALISE: And you've got to think about the health and welfare of the kids. The whole purpose of a public school system is to serve the children. And look, it's a cop out to say we can't figure out how to get it done. Of course we can. This is America. And there are good school systems that are figuring out how to do it and are doing it safely.The kids, by the way, they are going to be out playing with their friends. They are going to be doing things. It's much better to have them in a controlled environment in a school where, number one, where they are learning, so we're not holding our kids back. But where they are also being around people where they all have to have masks. The schools have their own protocols, and they're going to keep these kids safe. But we've got to get kids back in school. It's important for the health and welfare of those kids. It's also important for our economy so that the parents are able to get their kids back in school again, too.INGRAHAM: It's almost like there is a concerted effort to tank the economy before the election, the cynics out there would say. Congressman Jordan, it isn't just teachers, though, teachers unions taking advantage of this epidemic. Here is AOC.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. ALEXANDRA OCASIO-CORTEZ, D-N.Y.: Americans have actually gotten even more progressive in the middle of this pandemic. When people say and ask me how are you going to pass this or how are you going to pass that, I tell them we have got to win the Senate and the White House. That is our legislative strategy for getting this stuff passed.(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM: Congressman Scalise, your response?SCALISE: I mean, this is disgusting. All they care about is politics, like Jim said.INGRAHAM: I'm sorry, I'm sorry, Scalise. Let's go to Jordan.SCALISE: Go get them, Jordan.INGRAHAM: Sorry. Sorry.JORDAN: I don't think they're going to win. I think Donald Trump is going to win reelection because he deserves it. He's done a great job leading our country. The great American comeback is happening. Americans understand common sense. They understand what needs to happen. And they're sick and tired of this liberal double standard where Mayor Garcetti can go out and kneel to the mob without a mask, thousands of protestors around him, but he's going to shut down schools and not let kids go learn this fall. It's crazy, and I think Americans are going to remember that on Election Day.INGRAHAM: Congressmen, it's great to see both of you. It's been a long time. Thanks so much for coming on.JORDAN: Good to be with you.INGRAHAM: All right, and the president's niece released her new tell-all book today, and the media of course laughing up her diagnosis. But is it medically deficient? Renowned psychiatrist Carole Lieberman is here. She's going to tell us the truth about Mary's sniping, next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)INGRAHAM: President Trump's niece Mary Trump released her supposed tell- all today, and in it the clinical psychologist diagnoses her uncle with severe personality disorders, writing, quote, \"I have no problem calling Donald a narcissist. A case could be made that he also meets the criteria for antisocial personality disorder, which is in its most severe forms generally considered sociopathy.\"But my next guest says Mary Trump's book reveals more about her and her own issues than it does about the president. Joining me now, I can't wait to hear, is Carole Lieberman, clinical forensic psychiatrist. Dr. Lieberman, what does she get wrong as far as you're concerned?DR. CAROLE LIEBERMAN, CLINICAL FORENSIC PSYCHIATRIST: Well, Mary Trump wants the public to believe everything she writes hook, line, and sinker. And she is basing this on the fact that she's the niece and therefore would have been privy to family dynamics, family events, and so on. But she, in regard to that, first of all, she is 20 years younger than president. And so her view of the family would've been very different from his. And so she's conjecturing when she is trying to say what things caused him to be - - to have what personality disorders.And plus, if the family is as maliciously -- malignantly dysfunctional as she says, then she obviously would have been and is affected by that as well. So that is affecting her truth telling.However, even more importantly, she says that we should believe her because she is a psychologist, a PhD psychologist. And yes, presumably that's correct. However, New York state has no record of her being licensed as a psychologist.INGRAHAM: OK, so New York, according to your looking into this, your research, she is not licensed in New York as a clinical psychologist? Really?LIEBERMAN: Yes. Unless she is going under some assumed name, which really they don't permit generally. It has to be a legal name.INGRAHAM: OK, we got that. Hold on the second, Doctor. Here is a snippet from Mary Trump's interview with ABC's George Stephanopoulos that will air tomorrow.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS, ABC NEWS: April, 2017, you see the president in the Oval Office. And you tell him don't let them get you down. Did you mean that?MARY TRUMP, DONALD TRUMP'S NIECE: I did. He said, they won't get me. So far it looks like he's right.STEPHANOPOULOS: And if you are in the Oval Office today, what would you say to him?MARY TRUMP: Resign.(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM: Dr. Lieberman, I don't know her. Is that a lot of anger right there? What is that?LIEBERMAN: Well, she's a very confused woman. And largely it has to do with her relationship with her grandfather, who does, according to her book, I read the whole book, he does seem like he was rather cold and had some problems. But really, she is angry at her father, her deceased father. And she's blaming all the problems that her father had on Donald Trump, on her grandfather as well. But he was an alcoholic. He didn't really work to join the grandfather. He wanted to fly planes and he wanted to go fishing while Donald was at Wharton studying business, and then going along with his father trying to learn the family business.And the reasons why she -- the motivations behind this are clearly greed, because she's still angry that she didn't get her share of her family fortune. Jealousy, jealousy of the success that Donald Trump has. Politics, she is totally opposite him in politics. And she says at the beginning of the book, I could've written this book any time, and I'm not trying to cash in now and I'm not trying to do this for political reasons and so on. I could've written about my uncle any time. And then at the end of the book she apparently forgets that she wrote that, and she says if anything I would've said about my uncle before it 2016, nobody would listen to.INGRAHAM: Dr. Lieberman, you read it very carefully. And we appreciate you joining us tonight. I will not read the book. No interest.And after building up a big early lead in the polls, has Joe Biden gone too far in the left? A Trump pollster shares some interesting insights you won't see anywhere else. Don't go away.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)INGRAHAM: So Joe Biden built up an early lead in the polls if you can believe them. But instead of pivoting towards the center, he is just embracing radicalism. No more moderate Joe. \"The Washington Post\" is reporting that Biden's vision comes into view, and it's much more liberal than it was. So does team Trump see an opening?Here now is John McLaughlin, Trump 2020 campaign pollster. John, the president still faces a pretty big deficit in that RCP average. Again, it was wrong before in 2016, but this is not 2016 for a variety of reasons, nearly 10 points. So what are the pollsters missing?JOHN MCLAUGHLIN, TRUMP 2020 CAMPAIGN POLLSTER: That average is based on polls of adults and registered voters, not likely voters. And I'll tell you, it's skewed. The same polls that they did four years ago because they didn't think we could win are now coming out because they're afraid we are going to win.And the president has had a great couple weeks. He lit up at 4.8 million new jobs, the Mount Rushmore speech, July 4th speech. Joe Biden admitted he wants to defund the police, sees the police as an enemy. And then he signs a socialist manifesto with Bernie Sanders where they are talking about just open borders, subsidizing -- giving welfare, taxpayer funded benefits to illegal immigrants, cutting the military, the defense, abolishing the police, criminal justice. It goes on and on.The president gave a great press conference today where he took it to Joe Biden and the campaign is on offence, and the polls are showing it. Those bad polls, the Rasmussen, Scott Rasmussen's poll had us gaining five. Zogby's poll had us gain six. The Hill-Harris poll had us within four, gaining six again. So the president --INGRAHAM: Hold on, hold on. Take a breath. Take a breath. Your point -- we have one minute here. Your point is that Biden is actually losing momentum on the national stage?MCLAUGHLIN: Yes. Yes, he's losing momentum on the national stage. And our 911 ad is doing great in terms of realizing people that we're changing the issues and we're moving things in the direction of the president, and that Biden is controlled by the radical left.INGRAHAM: John, quick point here. The issue of schools, being an advocate for their reopening, in 15 seconds, how important is that for women voters who want their kids back in school, 15 seconds?MCLAUGHLIN: Very important, because the argument is, what does more harm to their children? We can reopen the school safely with guidance principles, or their kids don't go to school. So they lose ground. So what is more harmful to their children? Keeping --INGRAHAM: All right, John, thank you. That was 15 seconds.Some breaking news regarding Kanye's candidacy? Oh, boy, stay there. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)INGRAHAM: Kanye West's audacious presidential campaign has come to an abrupt end. Here is the saga. New York Magazine's Ben Jacobs reached out to Kanye's publicist about the lack of ballot access. Quote, \"The initial response was to loop in another spokesperson on the email.

The President of the United States says enough is enough, it's time for the federal government to step in.In prime time tonight, I'm Harris Faulkner in for Martha MacCallum and this is \"The Story.\" Some of the most disturbing video is coming from Chicago. We got our first look at an incident from Friday. It's now being described as a coordinated ambush on police. Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot calling them violence vigilantes as they were hurling rocks an explosives.49 as police officers hurt including one who had his eye socket broken. Another who had his kneecap broken by thrown objects. We move now to the scene in Portland, Oregon. 53 days into the violence there. Criminals tried to light the court house on fire. Federal agents deployed tear gas in an attempt to force them back and the Mayor of Portland blames the unrest on the presence of federal agents and the person who sent them there, President Trump.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MAYOR TED WHEELER, D-OREGON: Your presence here is actually leading to more violence and more vandalism. We are all telling the Trump administration. Stop the rhetoric. Take these people out of our city. They are not helping us. They are hurting us and what we're seeing is a blatant abuse of police tactics by the federal government.(END VIDEO CLIP)FAULKNER: Top Democrats on Capitol Hill say they are alarmed and are calling for an investigation into the use of federal law enforcement. The President. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PRESIDENT DONALD J. TRUMP: More federal law enforcement, than I can tell you. In Portland, they did a fantastic job. They grabbed them, lot of people in jail. They're leaders.These are anarchists, these are not protesters and you ended up over the summer. This is worse than Afghanistan by far. This is worse than anything anyone's ever seen. All run by the same Liberal Democrats.(END VIDEO CLIP)FAULKNER: We have a big line up to tackle all of it tonight. DHS Acting Deputy Secretary Ken Cuccinelli on the federal government's plan to get the cities under control. Good to see you, Ken. Coming up. Congressman Jim Jordan, Ranking Member of the Committee that's now investigating all of this. Congressman, welcome.Plus analysis from two law enforcement experts, Dr. Cedric Alexander and Robert Harris, gentlemen, look forward to it. For now let's begin with our correspondent on the ground in Chicago - in Chicago tonight, Matt Finn with all that's happening right now.Matt, a busy day and night.MATT FINN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: And Harris, this new disturbing video reveals each step of a highly organized mob style attack against the Chicago police department at the base of this statue that's sent 18 officers to the hospital, one recovering this evening with a broken eye socket, the other a broken knee cap.Thousands of protesters Friday evening marching to tear down the Christopher Columbus statue. Rioters then blend in and popped up lots of umbrellas to shield their identities. Then a person drops off all types of weapons including frozen water bottles that were thrown at police, also rocks and explosives. CPD also says PVC pipe that was holding banners was intentionally sharpened and thrown at police.Today Chicago's top cop acknowledges, there were alleged incidents of brutality at that Friday riot and says they will be investigated but for now the police superintendent says all of his officers must wear their protective gear to all protest, going forward because it's not clear they're going to remain peaceful.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DAVID BROWN, CHICAGO POLICE SUPERINTENDENT: Chicago police does not want to engage in violent interactions with peaceful protesters. But when the law is being broken, or has been broken, our oath demands that we act. I understand the anger that is present in our city and in our nation. CPD is on the front lines of this anger.(END VIDEO CLIP)FINN: It was another bloody weekend here in Chicago police say between just the hours of 6:00 PM Friday and midnight last night, 12 people were killed, 63 people were shot in 41 shootings across the city and this weekend once again, children were shot here in Chicago.This time, a shooting injured cousins, two boys, ages 10 and 11.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PASTOR DONOVAN PRICE: Is Covid-19 the thing is going to kill our children or our each other going to be the thing that kills our children? Which pandemic is worse?(END VIDEO CLIP)FINN: And today Chicago's top cop says he welcomes any federal assistance, the President wants to send to this city. Harris.FAULKNER: Wow that Finn, that really resonated on such a visceral level. Which pandemic is worse? Thank you very much for getting us kicked off with that report. Department of Homeland Security Acting Deputy Secretary now, Ken Cuccinelli.Ken, when you hear that about what's going on in the streets and I know that you told The Washington Post that there will be a heavy presence now in Portland and other cities. What can we expect? What would that look like?KEN CUCCINELLI, ACTING DEPUTY SECRETARY, DHS: Well, when violence advances, the President has made it clear that he wants us to advance law enforcement to push it back, to bring peace back to these cities. We defend our federal facilities where we have people like the head of the police there in Chicago who want to cooperate with us.We are - we welcome that cooperation and we're happy to come help them do their job and achieve the peace that we all aspire to for their communities and you know, the clip you played of him. I couldn't have said it any better. I agree with every single word he said.You know, I wish we were seeing that in every city around the country who's having to take on these violent mobs.FAULKNER: You're talking about the Chicago Police Superintendent that we showed I think.CUCCINELLI: Yes ma'am.FAULKNER: You know Deputy Secretary, the Mayor of Portland says violence was improving there but then federal law enforcement made it worse. What - what's your response to that?CUCCINELLI: You know, that is a fake talking point. Look, we are literally at a point today where I think we're now over 50 straight days. 50.FAULKNER: 53.CUCCINELLI: 50 days of violence in Portland. 53. Thank you and we advanced an additional DHS law enforcement component only about two weeks ago so they were a 35-40 days into daily violence that this Mayor was encouraging. He wasn't discouraging it.Look at the simple - simple fact that he hasn't put a curfew on and enforced it. One of the simplest way is to bring peace to the streets of a city. He refuses to do it because he's politicizing the violence to his own political advantage while President Trump has put us there to try to help bring peace and order back to that part of the city where we have jurisdiction near the federal facilities.FAULKNER: All right, I want to talk with you about what that jurisdiction looks like and - and what I would call as a former military route, the rules of engagement here because I think that's really important. You know, you've got people accusing the federal agents on the ground of taking people off the streets, snatching them up and putting them in the backs of cars and putting something over their head.I want to speak to what the facts really are and - and what they're able to do, these federal agents.CUCCINELLI: Right, so in Portland just like everywhere else, our agents are identified as police on front and back and they have their unit identifiers on both shoulders so there are Customs Border Protection agents for instance. They're helping the federal protective service protect the federal buildings in Portland.So Customs Border Protection have police on the front, will have Customs Border Protection and Homeland Security seal on each shoulder and their unit identifier. These are board tack which is like a SWAT team and they have an individual identifier as well, not their name but a code identifier like AS3 or something like that, that's unique to them.They are always identifying themselves, including to the subject of some news this week, a viral video you seem to be alluding to. They identify themselves to that subject. They didn't identify themselves to the crowd who is shouting at them because they have no obligation to do that and frankly it distracts them from keeping themselves and the subject they're dealing with, safe during their interaction with such people.So very standard for us and we're going to continue to keep the presence there as long as the violence stays. If those violent criminals want us to leave or to reduce our presence, we're always there, have been since the court house and other buildings were built but if they want to see our presence reduced, then the violence really does need to come to an end.That's the point. We're not there because it's Portland, we're not there because of Mayor Wheeler. We're there because violent criminals are doing damage every day and threatening the federal presence that's already there in Portland.FAULKNER: And I'm clear on it but politics are playing a role because when the President talks about these cities, he talks about them with specificity being liberal and Democrat-led. Does that complicate the job you're on the ground doing?CUCCINELLI: Well look, I really believe that the years and years of liberal policies contribute. There's a reason there's violence in 50-year liberal enclaves and not in 50-year conservative enclaves. I mean this is - this is you know, I don't treat it politically Republican Democrat but policies and ideas matter and have consequences over a long time.This isn't new to Portland. Two years ago, the Mayor there, publicly withdrew the police from defending an ICE facility, a Department of Homeland Security facility in the middle of a siege. It was an invitation to violence and that's exactly what happened. So you know, we don't have much choice but to do our job and we're committed to doing our job.If the Mayor wants to try to get in the way and make that harder, he can make it harder by reducing cooperation. We prefer and seek cooperation with state and local officials all over the country and in most of the country, those are very productive relationships and where they exist, we have more peace and better law enforcement.FAULKNER: Well and - and just to wrap up with this point of fact. I interviewed the White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany today and she talks specifically about the two models that you're going forth with, one that is an operation based on cooperation and the other that is based on non-cooperation.A big job all around. 53 days of unrest in one of America's great cities. Thank you very much. I know it's a long time.CUCCINELLI: Harris, good to be with you.FAULKNER: Thank you very much for joining me. Thanks. Also here tonight, Republican Congressman Jim Jordan of Ohio. He's the ranking member on the House Judiciary Committee. Let's talk about where we are in terms of shoring up America's cities and what we can do from Capitol Hill?REP. JIM JORDAN, R-OHIO: Well, the Democrats you said earlier the Democrats are alarmed by a federal presence. The cops here want the federal presence. You heard that from the Police Chief in Chicago where 49 officers as you pointed out were attacked. So for goodness sakes, look, the Mayor of Portland said this was improving until the federal - this has been 53 days that they've done that.That's 7.5 weeks of rioting, looting, violence, attacks a police officer, destruction of property and - and they - they don't want any help. They just want to let this continue to happen to their constituents, to their business owners in the - in their city. I mean this is scary to me and the idea that this is somehow President Trump's fault.I mean we went back and checked Harris. You know the last time there was a Republican Mayor elected in Portland? 1956. I mean that that was long before you were born and it was even before I was born so this site - every - every day - every member of the city council in Portland, Democrat.No Republican so how was this a Republican problem. This is scary what's going on. What Democrat mayors, Democratic governors are allowing to happen to their cities, to their constituents is frightening and I know that these cops just like the police chief in Chicago said, the officers certainly like federal help there to have them deal with the situation that they've been countering now for 53 days in the city of Portland.FAULKNER: You know I am curious because it would seem that all of this started as a conversation that the nation was ready to have about police reform and we've gone far afield from that. I interviewed Senator Scott, Tim Scott on my special last night on all of this and you know, the thing that confuses me now as we get back to work and it's Monday, a fresh new week is that Democrats have said that they really want to put off that police reform and they want to put off a deeper conversation about you know, potentially making things different and better.How do you is a Republican on the Hill go forward with that? That's a lot of pressure on everybody if you have to sit with this scene, replicating over and over, where we dealt with one autonomous zone, then we had several.JORDAN: No, it's sad and Tim Scott, Senator Scott's done tremendous work and he truly wanted to get to a consensus, get to good legislation that helped protect law enforcement but also dealt with the situation, the tragedy that took place in Minneapolis and he had a good bill.We offered during the mark up on the House side in the Judiciary Committee, we offered on the Republican side 12 thoughtful good amendments. They didn't take a single one of them because this was about politics for the Democrats. That's the scary thing so I wish we could get to some real good legislation that helps - that helps police departments, helps these communities but they don't want to do it.I mean you think about this. They - they won't stop the rioting and the looting but they'll stop kids from going to school. They won't stop the rioting and the looting but they'll stop people from going to church. They won't stop the rioting and the looting, they'll stop people from attending a loved one's funeral.So for Democrats, this is everything and that's the scary thing and most Americans with just good common sense say what is going on. It is time for this to end. It is time to quit the blaming and step up as Democrat mayors, Democrat governors in these respective states and cities to step up and take responsibility and stop it and hold people accountable for the wrong doing that they are seeing and doing every single day.FAULKNER: You know it's interesting, we're seeing people get on the same page among the citizenry and we don't want to break everything around race and culture but I just bring this Fox news poll to mind from earlier today. Blacks and whites are based on the same 80 and 81 percent on the issue of law and order and what's happening in our streets today.JORDAN: Of course.FAULKNER: That the critical nature. We are in it together.JORDAN: Yes, we sure are.FAULKNER: Congressman Jordan, thank you very much for your time and your perspective.JORDAN: Thank you Harris. You bet. Take care.FAULKNER: I want to - thanks. Let's bring in Dr. Cedric Alexander now. Former President of the National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives and Robert Harris, Director of the Los Angeles Police Protective League. Gentlemen, thank you for being here. I wanted to come together with both of you because I've had deep conversations about how we get to moving forward with both of you. Dr. Alexander, I'll start with you. Chicago, black on black crime. That was not caused by George Floyd. It's another summer of discontent, doesn't even touch it, it is destruction and it is soul destroying, what's going on with the murder in the streets there.DR. CEDRIC ALEXANDER, FORMER PRESIDENT, NATIONAL ORGANIZATION OF BLACK LAW ENFORCEMENT EXECUTIVES: Yes so let me speak to Chicago as many other cities, large cities across this country but more specifically to Chicago is that what we're seeing is not new to Chicago. This has been going on long before Mayor Lightfoot got there, long before Rahm Emanuel got here.It is been in that system there for a long time and it goes beyond quite frankly being just a police problem. You're talking to someone who is a Chief twice in this country in two cities in this country and I think the police do the very best they can with the resources they are given but I think we all also have to admit, there's bigger issues that exist in some of those communities where we see this high volume of crime that continues to occur, year after year after year after year.It put good residents in those communities at risk and it puts our police officers at risk as well so we got to have a much broader conversation beyond policing as how we begin to resolve some of those issues and I think it's a - it's really just not a Chicago problem, it's an American problem that we all are going to have to confront but let me say one more thing here before I end here also Harris.Is that for me, this is not going to be a Right or a Left kind of discussion in which I'm going to have. This is about what's right and what's wrong and what we as a nation are going to have to do if we want to make systemic change.FAULKNER: Yes.ALEXANDER: But one side of the aisle blaming the other side of the aisle is just politics that don't amount to anything while people are losing lives and police officers are at risk.FAULKNER: You know Robert Harris, as we look at the video that's come in today from the middle part of the country from Portland and other places, do you think it's time for federal help? You know, you've led many - you've been a police officer so when do you as an officer say yep, we need that help?ROBERT HARRIS, DIR, LA POLICE PROTECTIVE LEAGUE: Well first, I just want to agree with the doctor in that bullets do not care about political affiliation, they just don't and I think a path forward here is to take a page out of our rank and file playbook in that here in Los Angeles, some officers I believe are the most professional in the country and we work collaboratively, consistently with our federal partners, with our other adjacent local jurisdictions.And I think some of our political leaders could really take a cue from that. I think the path forward is finding people who can exercise some ownership over where we're at instead of blaming, instead of looking at law enforcement as a political football and bring the key stakeholders to the table which in my opinion is the Los Angeles Police Protective League in rank and file unions because we represent those who are out there every day, trying to make a difference and who recognize that professionalizing our profession is a positive thing for everybody involved.FAULKNER: You know, I listened to what you're saying and I think Gosh, don't we thirst on Capitol Hill for emergency hearings at this point. And look, you know, I get it. They probably have to be virtual. Look how good you guys look on TV. It's virtual. We can get it done.But when you're going - when you're talking about pulling all these people together, we - we need to do that and also pull some from the streets so we understand where they're coming from because they're not organized, that group. We can't assume we know. Robert Harris, Dr. Cedric Alexander, thank you for your time tonight.ALEXANDER: Thank you for having me.HARRIS: Thank you Harris.FAULKNER: President Trump is not buying this polling. The polls show him trailing Joe Biden, many of them. National Press Secretary for Trump 2020 Hogan Gidley will join me next on that. Stay close.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CHRIS WALLACE, FOX NEWS HOST: Mr. President, you'll be happy to know that Fox news has a new poll out today and you're going to be the very first person to hear about it. In the National horse race Joe Biden leads you by 8 points, 49 percent to 41. I understand. We still have more than 100 days to this election but at this point you're losing.TRUMP: First of all, I'm not losing because those are fake polls. They were fake in 2016 and now they're even more fake. The polls were much worse in 2016.(END VIDEO CLIP)FAULKNER: That of course the President of the United States, dismissing the notion that he has fallen behind in the 2020 race against Joe Biden despite the latest Fox news polls showing the former Vice President pulling ahead by 8.But I asked the team to pull some more, you know like getting a bit on a home, you want at least three. So here are a couple more. The NBC news Wall Street journal poll has Biden up by 11. The ABC News Washington Post says it's more like 15 and to be fair, the Rasmussen poll is up by three on the low end so you've got a little bit of a mix here.Here now to respond, Hogan Gidley is National Press Secretary for Trump 2020. Hogan, thanks for joining me tonight. No matter where you go, the polling is not positive for President Trump and we have in you a mix. You just left the White House now and leadership on the campaign. How is this resonating, do you figure in both places?HOGAN GIDLEY, NATIONAL PRESS SECRETARY, TRUMP 2020: Well first of all, the President's absolutely right. Those polls are fake. For example in 2016, in the exit polling Fox polled 36 percent Democrats. The poll that Chris Wallace just referenced, is 46 percent Democrat. It's a 10 percent increase of who they actually look at in poll and of course elections at the end of the day come down to choices. We know we're in great shape with the American people because when you look at what Donald Trump will do with safety and security and protecting the American family, protecting our way of life, we're in great shape.When you compare and contrast that with the choice of Joe Biden, someone who when asked is it OK if we redirect funds away from the police, he says yes, absolutely. That's a big problem for the Left. It's a big problem for Democrats and I understand the media is doing a really good job covering for Joe Biden saying, no redirect doesn't mean defund the police.If that's the case, let me propose something to you Harris if I may, your next paycheck, I'm not going to defund it, I'm just going to redirect some of that money into my account. Everyone knows that's a cut and that's what Joe Biden wants to do. It will leave our American families vulnerable.It will leave our communities less safe. This president has done everything to protect them to this point. He'll do so in the next four years.FAULKNER: Interesting. You know as I'm looking at these polls and I'm just going to run back over on because you mentioned Democrats in the polling and you're right about that, about the percentages of the ones that we named. Quinnipiac, not the case. The Hill, not the case and certainly Rasmussen and while the numbers may not be as great between these two men as you look at the margin of error, they're still negative for the President.So what are you concentrating on because when - when you walk past, the President did well. Seven points in 2016 above Hillary Clinton and independents and you know and digging deep in this, because you're looking at how many Democrats are participating in them, that you've got a little bit of a problem.You've got the softness in independents so what do you do about that?GIDLEY: Well - well, a couple of things. Again, the methodology of those polls that you're talking about now, the same methodology that got it wrong in 2016 but you don't have to guess how the economy would look under Joe Biden. We just saw it for seven years. Depressed wages, 3.5 million jobs going to China, horrible trade deals that gutted the American middle class, kicked the American workers square in the teeth.Compare and contrast that with Donald Trump. 7 million jobs coming into this country, manufacturing plants relocating. Also you saw 500,000 of those manufacturing jobs that they said on the Left would never come back, he brought them back. You don't have to guess what Joe Biden would do with our city streets.As I said, when the lawlessness broke out, he was completely silent except when he did pop up out of his hidey hole. He made the point, hey yes, let's defund the police so let's be clear. Your jobs aren't safe. Your families aren't safe and your American way of life is not safe with Joe Biden because through his policies, he's waged war for the last 50 years on all three.FAULKNER: Well, and with Democrats, they may be handing you a bit of a gift politically by saying they don't even want to tackle the police reform until 2021 when they hope to win majorities again. Look, I want to move on to something that the President said about if he were not to be re-elected. Let's watch. I'm curious to know what he meant by this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: I think mail-in voting is going to rig the election, I really do.WALLACE: Are you suggesting that you might not accept the results of the election?TRUMP: I have to see.WALLACE: Can you give a direct answer, you will accept the election.TRUMP: I have to see. Look, I have to see. I'm not going to just say yes. I'm not going to say it and I didn't last time either.(END VIDEO CLIP)FAULKNER: Hogan, you were in the church with me with the President as I interviewed him last month.GIDLEY: That's right.FAULKNER: And I asked him a similar question. He said that he would accept whatever the results were. What changed?GIDLEY: Well, if it's done properly, of course but the fact is as the President pointed out so articulately there. The Democrats are pushing for universal mail-in voting. That's just fraught with all types of possibility for cheating and the Democrats know it.So they're bragging about a policy that could completely compromise an election and then they're asking us to abide by those results. That's ridiculous and let's also note, we're talking about a Democrat party here who solve the intelligence about Russia meddling into the election and did nothing about it. It was Donald Trump who stood up for the integrity of the election system by bringing in the NSC, the FBI, the CIA to work with states and locales to make sure every vote mattered and every vote was counted. Those are the facts of the case.And after that election in 2016 it was the Democrats who went on an attack against this president like we've never seen before. Perpetrating an entire Russia hoax, they were the ones who continue to say to this day that it was Hillary Clinton who won the election. They are still saying Stacey Abrams is the duly elected governor of Georgia.They are the ones that have a problem standing up for the results of an election, but we won't take a lesson from them on that and we're sure not going to say right now that whatever happens, we are just going to say that's the way it is, because we know now that Democrats have a history of cheating and elections and we're not going let them cheat on this one.If this election is free and this election is fair, Donald Trump will get four more years in the White House.FAULKNER: Well, and then there is one thing that no one can guess, and that is how COVID-19 will play a role in how people choose to vote. We'll cover it all. Hogan Gidley, great to see you tonight. Thank you.GIDLEY: Thanks so much, Harris. I appreciate it.FAULKNER: Today in Florida, 10,000 new coronavirus cases, a rising death toll, and now some are suggesting reinstating the lockdown. It might be the only way out of this, they say.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)FAULKNER: COVID-19 cases continuing to rise in the State of Florida, there is one particular area that is more alarming to all of the experts, Miami- Dade County is now being referred to by many as the epicenter of this disease right now. With more than 23,370 new cases just last week, 170 people died.The ICU's have been filled for days. And now there is fear that another massive lockdown might be the only way to slow down COVID-19.Joining me now, the mayor of Miami-Dade County, Carlos Gimenez. Good to see you tonight, Mayor. Thanks for joining me.So, some criticism is coming your way with how the reopening was handled. And I'm curious, because you had to wait according to federal guidelines for a 14-day decreasing COVID-19 before reopening, did you wait that period of time?MAYOR CARLOS GIMENEZ, R-MIAMI-DADE COUNTY, FLORIDA: Yes, we met all the what's called the gating criteria, our positivity rate was below -- was below 10 percent for 14 days, and so, yes, we had the green flag to open it, and we also opened it where the advice -- on the advice of our medical advisors.We have like a 200-page document on how to open all the regulations and all the businesses had to go through. Our people had to wear masks on interior spaces. Outdoors they had to wear a mask unless they could maintain a distancing of six feet.What happened was sometime around June, a lot of the people stopped abiding by some of these rules and we saw young people especially start to reengage, re-go out social partying, and all of that. And then we had the demonstrations. And so, all those things.(CROSSTALK)FAULKNER: What young people do.GIMENEZ: Exactly, what people -- young people doing what young people do, and that actually is the -- we saw spike in the middle of June, it was all young people, 18 to 34, 35 to 45-year-olds, and then that then led to a contagion in the general population, and that's what we see today.FAULKNER: How frustrating is it to know that the good hard work of your citizens there was not may be completely unraveled, but certainly damaged in terms of what you have to do next? So, you've the ICUs full, what will you do if hospitals start to reach capacity? Like you're not going in that good direction again, so what are you going to do?GIMENEZ: Well, we are seeing a slow down on the speed up, let's put it that way. It's not -- we're not seeing --FAULKNER: OK.GIMENEZ: -- the hospitalizations rising at the same rate, we are seeing tapering down. We have instituted a curfew a couple of weeks ago. We close down some of the assemblies like casinos and movie theaters, and all of that. Bars have never been opened here. We close down the interior spaces of restaurants.And so, our medical advisors say, hey, let's see what those measures take, also re-emphasize the wearing of masks, now masks are mandatory inside and outside. Re-emphasize that and then enforcement.And so, we passed an ordinance, you know, last week that allows for civil penalties, not just criminal penalties for not abiding with the rules, and so far, we've shot some businesses down, we've also given some tickets. So, it's reinforcing the rules, the good rules that we put in place --FAULKNER: So --GIMENEZ: -- a couple of months ago that if people just would have followed, we wouldn't be where we are today.FAULKNER: So, Mayor, you know, I have to look at this, now you're going to depend on the police to shore up all of this. That's a lot on them, and especially when you look across the country with what police officers are going through to start writing tickets for that.GIMENEZ: Right.FAULKNER: But that's obviously what you think you need to do. Let's talk statewide, the largest teacher's union in Florida is now suing the state over safety concerns for kids going back to school. What is your plan for schools in your area?GIMENEZ: I'm working with the superintendent and we're working on a plan whether at the time six weeks from now, whether it will be safe to open up schools or not. We're not going to put kids in an unsafe environment, we're also look, going to look at the science and what it does, but the superintendent and I are working very closely together on that.FAULKNER: All right.GIMENEZ: We're going to have different plans depending on where this virus is at that time, and then we'll make that determination when the time comes.FAULKNER: Really quickly before I let you go, let's take a look at the hecklers --GIMENEZ: Sure.FAULKNER: -- who were yelling shame on you to your state Governor DeSantis at a presser today, should Florida follow one of the set rules? With the stress on the state be eased if DeSantis implemented a statewide mask mandate? Would that make it easier? We'll keep this video up. I'm just curious to get your thoughts on that, do you need help from the state from the top down?GIMENEZ: No, not really. I think, you know, we, in our tri-county area we have the mask order, it's the Dade, Broward, and Palm Beach has a -- and also Monroe has a mask order. The governor has allowed us a certain amount of autonomy here. It's different in southeast Florida than it is in other parts of the state.And so, look, it's even different inside Miami-Dade County then it is, you know, in other parts of Dade County.FAULKNER: Yes.GIMENEZ: Right? And so we have rural areas, we have urban areas. And so, you know, I -- the governor has been nothing but supportive of the efforts that we've had down here. He sent additional personnel to our hospitals. He sent additional resources to Miami-Dade County. So, I can't be anything but appreciative of the work that Governor DeSantis has done here for Miami- Dade.FAULKNER: Well, I'm broadcasting from New Jersey, and New York and my state led the world who know at one point in terms of the --GIMENEZ: Yes.FAULKNER: -- the rate at which we were going, you can turn it around.GIMENEZ: Yes.FAULKNER: Blessings to you and your county and your state.GIMENEZ: Thank you, thank you very much. God bless you.FAULKNER: Absolutely.Texas Senator Ted Cruz is warning his state, 2020 has a bull's-eye on it. And if Democrats win Texas, it's all over. Senator Ted Cruz is here next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)FAULKNER: Senator Ted Cruz of the great state of Texas has issued a new warning to his fellow Republicans just this week that the 2020 race is real in the lone star state. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. TED CRUZ, R-TEXAS: In Texas, the stakes are especially high. Texas is the single biggest target for the left in 2020, politically speaking. The 38 electoral votes at stake. That's a U.S. Senate seat at stake, and Texas is the key, it's a national domination for years to come. If the Democrats win Texas, it's all over.(END VIDEO CLIP)FAULKNER: Well, the last time Texas went for a Democrat was Jimmy Carter back in 1976. However, now a growing number of polls show President Trump neck and neck with Joe Biden there. Seeing a potential opening the Biden campaign has begun running its own ads across the state. And the latest Real Clear Politics average of polls shows President Trump up by fewer than a half point in Texas.Joining me now, Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas. Great to see you tonight. Thank you.CRUZ: Harris, good evening. Thank you for having me. And by the way, congrats on your big show last night.FAULKNER: Thank you very much. We got into it on how to take America forward. I appreciate that.CRUZ: Good.FAULKNER: Look, you know, when you look at it, it doesn't seem like Texas would go Democrat, I mean, what are you reading and saying, yes, alarm bells?CRUZ: Well, if you look at what's happening nationally, there are two broad demographic trends going on nationally, blue-collar workers, union members are moving right, and that's moving midwestern states more Republican, states like Ohio and Michigan and Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, every one of which went for Donald Trump in 2016.But at the same time, we're seeing suburban voters, in particular suburban women who are moving left. And that's moving states with big suburban population. States like Georgia and Texas and Arizona, all of them are becoming much, much more purple. And that's a real challenge, because with a state like Texas we know that New York and California are bright blue for the foreseeable future. If Texas joins them, that's the entire election. We can't let that happen.FAULKNER: So, two things, I'm going to ask our team to put up that headline from the Dallas morning news. Because we can speak to exactly what the senator is talking about. It's the headline, suburban women voters key to Democratic revival in Texas. They'll put it up eventually. But I -- there it is.I want to get your idea about how you reach those suburban women. You don't just throw in the towel at this point, so what's the strategy?CRUZ: Well, and it's important to mention, you know, a lot of the media coverage suggests that what's going on in Texas is racial or ethnic and it's based on the growing Hispanic number of voters. The data don't back that up that many of the Hispanics in Texas are quite conservative.Every time I have run in Texas I've gotten well over 40 percent of the Hispanic vote and that is despite running as an unapologetic conservative fighting to secure the border, build a wall, and stop amnesty.So, it's not the demographic piece on racial and ethnic lines. It's rather, I think the media have done a very good job of frightening -- painting a very scary picture with suburban women of the president. And you know, on one level, this election shouldn't be close.If you look at how extreme today's Democrats are, they're embracing socialism, even a month ago if I had come on your show, Harris, and if I had said, the Democrats are going to argue for abolishing the police, you would've said hold on there, that's a little bit crazy, and that's where they are.And given that, this election should be a slam-dunk, but unfortunately, I think the media is doing a very aggressive job of trying to convince a lot of voters who may not be paying all that close attention to this election that Trump --(CROSSTALK)FAULKNER: Yes --CRUZ: -- and the rights are kind of scary and violent, and wouldn't it be easier going with Uncle Joe just sitting in his basement? Isn't that a simpler calmer vision? And I've to say given how radical and extreme the voices are that the Democratic Party is letting go in their party, I don't think it would be calmer at all, but I think it's incumbent on us to make that case.FAULKNER: All right. Here is Joe Biden making his case to the state of Texas.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOE BIDEN, D-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I'm thinking all of you today across Texas, and though the rising case numbers is causing fear and apprehension, the virus is tough, but Texas is tougher.(END VIDEO CLIP)FAULKNER: So, Senator Cruz, today's polling, Fox News poll looked at what was most important to voters across the country, not specific to Texas. But 29 percent said COVID-19, and actually other things were below it like the economy. So, he hits that in your state --CRUZ: Yes.FAULKNER: -- and what do you say?CRUZ: Listen, I think those ads are effective. And by any measure, 2020 has been a hellish year.FAULKNER: Yes.CRUZ: Nobody started this year on New Year's Day predicting a global pandemic, the Great Depression, and race riots. I mean it's horrific what's happening to our country. And I think Biden and the Democrats are very smartly trying to capitalize on it. And what he, Biden is doing there in soft focus is say harken back to a calmer, peaceful time.That is a dangerous message. That's a compelling message pretty and I think that it's important if this election focuses on issues, if it focuses on substance, if it focuses on a contrast between free enterprise and socialism, and a contrast between the Constitution and Bill of Rights and rule of law versus anarchy and violence, we win it, but if it is a personality contest, that's what the Democrats want it to be because they think they win that election.FAULKNER: Senator Ted Cruz, thank you very much for your time tonight. Always good to see you.CRUZ: Always a pleasure.FAULKNER: Up next, the NFL training camp set to start next week, are the players going to show up? I caught a tweet by Patrick Mahomes. He's waiting for the COVID-19 plan. Football stars have launched a Twitter blitz to demand stricter coronavirus safety measures.Former NFL player Burgess Owens is with me. We love to go back and forth. Stay close.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)FAULKNER: The NFL has to move quickly to make an official decision about the 2020 season. Players are already starting to return to training camp this week. However, as COVID-19 cases continue to spike, a fall without football is looking like a very real possibility and that possibility is putting players at odds with the league.Here's an example, quarterback Drew Brees tweeted this. We need football. We need sports. We need hope. I'm not just showing it to you, he's using all exclamation points. It's that simple, get it done, NFL. He writes.Donovan Smith left-tackle for Tampa Bay wrote, risking my health, as well as my family's health does not seem like a risk worth taking.Here now Super Bowl champ turn candidate for Congress, Burgess Owens is with me. Great to see you, Burgess.BURGESS OWENS, FORMER NFL PLAYER: Harris, same here.FAULKNER: So where do you put this, do they play or not?OWENS; Well, I think what's unfortunate, these young men have a, they have a concern which is legitimate. I think the problem is you have a corporate activist unfortunately spending more time over the last few months trying to figure out how to give black people a separate anthem and actually dividing the American people and just getting down to what we need to get down.You know, it's a shame that you have an organization like the Disney World who has figured it out, small business owners around the country have figured this out. And you have Goodell -- Goodell who is not being -- or sit down and really think through how can he make sure his players are safe and the American people come together and do something that we've always enjoyed politics free which unfortunately these corporate activist don't believe in that, and that's what we are seeing the results of.FAULKNER: These are supreme athletes like yourself. Patrick Mahomes, OK, yes, I'm a Chiefs fan. But look, they won the Super Bowl, MVP players. Their health and well-being, their bodies are everything to them. So how do you make them comfortable and is there really enough time to do that now? Maybe you skipped the preseason?OWENS: Well, this is the thing. You know, it's not a surprise that fall is going to come and football season would eventually show up again.FAULKNER: It's not a --(CROSSTALK)OWENS: And I'll tell you. Right. These young men, this is their season, this is their zone. They want to play. They want to get paid. At the same time, they understand they have families they want to make sure that they're safe. These conversations should have been --FAULKNER: Yes.OWENS: -- should have been had a long time ago. So, we're at this point will they have a plan, a program set up. And they -- and everybody can play comfortable to go out there and play the game.But again, when you're lacking leadership, when you have people in this case, the commissioner who is focused on more things than the players and the fans, you get this kind of result of just being able to be looked at very helpless (Ph). It's unfortunate for everybody that he's not taking the control he should have by this time.FAULKNER: All right, you sort of passed on that you think that the black national anthem, the changing team's names and all that kind of a distraction. But they are a focal point for some teams like the Washington Redskins. I want to know your topline thought on changing the logo and the name there.OWENS: Well, my concern is that where does it stop? We have to understand that the people that, you know -- first of all, 90 percent of the American Indians have no problem with this name. And so, it's not -- it's those folks behind the scenes that's trying to actually continue to divide us.We have a great history. We have a history we should be not only engage with but be proud of as we learn how far we've come along the way. But we have the left that is actively trying to destroy our history, destroy anything we can come together with. And that's why we have to be concerned about. Where does it end? And we have no idea where it ends because progressive -- progressive people will continue to embrace progressive move forward and a leftist way. And that's what they have to do (Inaudible) unfortunately.FAULKNER: Football is supposed to be an escape. It's supposed to not be part of politics and all those things so we'll have to see what happens this fall and if we can just play ball.Burgess Owens, great to have you on the program tonight.OWENS: Thank you, Harris.FAULKNER: Thank you.OWENS: All the best.FAULKNER: Well, that's going to do it for me filling in for my friend, Martha MacCallum.

That is in just a moment.We will discuss the brand-new RNC news in terms of the convention in Florida has been canceled and the president's reasons why. What is the backup plan? We'll ask him that.We'll also talk about the violence, the -- literally, what he calls the war zone in America's cities. We'll talk about the upcoming election, COVID-19, left-wing conspiracy theories, Joe Biden, a lot to get to tonight.First, we do have major breaking news surrounding what we have identified on this show correctly as the biggest abuse of power, corruption scandal in American history, and that is Obama, Biden, Comey working together to destroy President Trump, first candidate Trump and transition team Trump.Now we have more definitive proof tonight because a bombshell document has now tonight been declassified by the DNI Director Radcliffe. It shows the most extreme measures that Jim Comey, Mr. Higher Honor himself, his FBI took in 2016 to spy on then-candidate Donald Trump.These newly unearthed materials include typewritten notes from an FBI agent named Joe Pientka detailing August 2016 briefing with Donald Trump, Lieutenant General Flynn and former Governor Chris Christie of New Jersey.The meeting was supposed to be just a routine defensive briefing that presidential candidates received from the FBI, but in truth, in reality, it was all a ruse. According to a source, the briefing was, quote, a cover to listen for any remarks from President Trump or anyone else about Russia.So, let's be clear, we now have indisputable evidence that the FBI literally early on planted a Crossfire Hurricane agent to spy on Team Trump. It also means that Jim Comey, Mr. Higher Honor, is caught in another massive lie.Jim, I reminded you a long time ago -- well, you have the rewrite to remain silent, I advised you to use. You should have listened. By the way, he testified that Trump was not under investigation, proving another lie. Take a look.All right, apparently, we didn't have that. We'll have it hopefully soon.Like he lied when he said the dirty dossier. Remember he went to Trump Tower, took notes as soon as he left, and he said that the dossier presented it alone to then -- well, President-elect Trump, said it's salacious but unverified.But we know that he used that dossier as the bulk of information to secure the FISA warrant to spy on candidate Trump just a month earlier.The official notes from the security briefing were filed under Crossfire Hurricane, which of course, was the official code name for Comey's Russia collusion witch hunt. It was a witch hunt.By the way, that bought and paid for dirty Russian dossier of Russian disinformation, Hillary paid for that. Guess who helped Hillary? It looks like Vladimir Putin's Russia.It was also filed under Crossfire Razor. Remember, that was the code name for the FBI's probe into and we now know the innocent Lieutenant General Michael Flynn. It is now time for investigative prosecutor Durham to now wrap this up, bring this to a grand jury, and we need indictments of every single solitary person involved in this corruption, this abuse of power, their premeditated lies to the FISA court, their denial of one American of civil liberties and constitutional rights, and them trying to influence the outcome of an election, and then undo a duly elected president.Mr. Durham, no more time for investigating. It's time for action. The evidence is overwhelming. It is incontrovertible. That and the public domain that we know could -- should result in indictments up all of these people we talk about.Now, get this. The agent that did conduct this, quote, briefing, Joe Pientka, was apparently running the Flynn probe. And his, quote, briefing notes were approved by none other than the infamous Peter Strzok and the FBI lawyer -- we talked a lot about him too -- Kevin Clinesmith.Remember, Clinesmith, he was the corrupt FBI bureaucrat, he literally texted colleagues that Trump supporters were crazies, and that Vice President Pence was stupid, and after Trump won, he texted, viva la resistance.And according to Inspector General Horowitz, it was Clinesmith literally forging FISA evidence against Carter Page all to spy on, backdoor spy on candidate Trump, transition team Trump and deep into the presidency of Donald Trump. And, of course, Clinesmith, Strzok, and Pientka, well, they were just a tip of the spear in this Russia collusion hoax.Now, this was an effort that started at the very top. This was the insurance policy in the unlikely event that he wins. That was Page and Peter Strzok texting each other. Now, that's what Obama's infamous, remember this date, January 5th, 2017, that was the Oval Office meeting.You know, that was the meeting that Obama directed, we need the right people on this doing the work. And maybe we shouldn't tell all of this to the incoming administration.This is the January 5th meeting in the Oval Office where Joe Biden who lied to George Stephanopoulos, I didn't know anything about this, where we know from Peter Strzok's handwritten notes that Biden suggested that the FBI used the 1799 Logan Act, which has never been used ever to prosecute anyone.Now, remember this was the meeting that Sally Yates was at, and she was shocked according to her testimony before the House Intelligence Committee that President Obama knew all of the intimate details about the unmasking and leaking of raw intelligence as it relates to General Flynn, and, of course, soon to be Russian counterpart Kislyak.That's why Susan Rice went back on the day that Donald Trump was inaugurated 15 days after this Oval Office meeting to write what is now known as the biggest CYA email to self on Obama's last day, Trump being sworn in day, claiming that Barack said, do everything by the book. Why would she write that four times, 15 days later?Now, this was clearly an effort to, first, monitor and take down the new president, to undo an election, and take down everyone around him. But as we all know, although the mob and the media, they've gotten all of this wrong. They pushed lies, smears, besmirchment, conspiracy theories, the entire hoax, they were dragging and pushing impeachment, ignoring quid pro quo Joe and zero experience Hunter.There was no Russia collusion. It was always a hoax. The dossier that was used for all of these FISA applications has been debunked. It was never verifiable. We know the sub source said it was just bar talk and we know that Steele had an agenda and that everybody was warned way ahead of time that Hillary paid for the Russian disinformation.Now, the real scandal, the real abuse of power is that President Obama, what did you know, Barack, when did you know it? Joe, the ever confused one, what did you know, Joe, and when did you know it?We know they turn tremendous tools of your government against their political adversary. It's a national disgrace, all must be held accountable, prosecutor Durham, we are waiting. What we know already should be indictments for many. It's time!If we don't get this right, we will not have a constitutional republic. We won't have equal justice and equal application of our laws.Here with mark, Ohio Congressman Jim Jordan, FOX News contributor Sara Carter, FOX News legal analyst Gregg Jarrett.Congressman Jordan, we start with you.There is enough that we know, all of us --REP. JIM JORDAN, R-OHIO: Yes.HANNITY: -- there was not many of us, between Congress and our ensemble cast, that we're digging deep into this. I count maybe 25 people total taking on the entire media mob. They were all wrong.My question to you is, what does this say to you and what does it say to Durham?The FBI went to then-candidate Trump, told him Russia might try to target you and your campaign. What they didn't tell him is, we're targeting you. They told him Russian might try to spy on you. What they didn't tell him is, we're spying on you, and they did it just 17 days into this investigation.It opens on July 31st. August 17th, they do this. Thirteen minutes for the defensive briefing as part of the briefing you're supposed to get and in an hour and 42 minutes, where they are trying to get information and set the president up.All of this comes after, as you said, Sean, the August 8th text message where Peter Strzok says, we'll stop Trump. And the August 15th text message where he says, we've got an insurance policy. And they start implementing that insurance policy two days later.HANNITY: Sara Carter, you were there with John Solomon. It was March 2017 when the whole unmasking thing began. I had a conversation with both you, soon thereafter, Gregg Jarrett joined in. Got to keep unpeeling the layers of onion. I think it's now an infamous discussion we've had.SARA CARTER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Absolutely, Sean. And look at these documents, they are explosive because if you think about it, there was August 2016, here is Joe Pientka, right, debriefing basically Trump and Governor Christie and Michael Flynn.And then in January, he goes back to the White House with Peter Strzok. He goes back to the White House -- remember, he is the one that's interviewing Michael Flynn and collecting the information, all the while, just as Congressman Jordan says, they're spying on the president of the United States.You know, this is something that is so explosive and so big. And if John Durham doesn't do his job, it doesn't mean that just these three were involved, Sean. What you have to think about is the scope of this. Both Pientka, Peter Strzok, as well as Kevin Clinesmith and all the others were directed by people above them. That is Andrew McCabe, that's James Comey, and that's those folks that were at the White House, including the president, then -- Barack Obama who knew everything that was going on in January 5th.HANNITY: And they need to be asked. Barack needs to answer --CARTER: Yes.HANNITY: -- what did he know and when did he know it? Same with Joe.My question to you, Gregg Jarrett. You wrote two number one best-selling books on this, amazing work that you did.On the legal side of this, what we now have in the public domain is enough to get indictments for all of these people as far as I'm concerned.GREGG JARRETT, FOX NEWS LEGAL ANALYST: Yes.HANNITY: You tell me as a lawyer if I'm wrong and why is it taking so long?At this point, I think the Prosecutor Durham has an obligation to get this over with and let the American people know, we need to know before November 3rd of this year.JARRETT: Well, I think Durham has been slow footed, I agree. COVID may have been slow down a bit.But if there was ever any doubt about how devious and corrupt James Comey and his cabal were, they should remove doubt. This meeting was not about debriefing Trump. It was about gathering incriminating evidence of a non- existing collusion conspiracy that the FBI well knew was a hoax. They knew it was a lie, paid for by the Hillary Clinton campaign. They didn't care.At the heart of it, you're right, Joe Pientka, I write about him in my book. But interestingly, the government has scrubbed him from all reports, including the FBI report, and the Department of Justice report, even the FISA court report, and the FBI has removed him from their website and sequestered him in San Francisco's field office refusing to make him available, notwithstanding repeated demands to Congress. That's the cover- up by the existing FBI Director Christopher Wray.And the other part of this equation is that the documents today, they're exculpatory. They tend to prove Trump innocence. And yet, the FBI and Christopher Wray have concealed these documents, along with the intel community, for the better part of four years.It's unconscionable. It's corrupt. And it's a cover-up (ph).(CROSSTALK)HANNITY: We had a little problem earlier. Let me hear it, because this is Comey now denying that which we now know is true. This guy said -- the holier-than-thou Mr. Higher honor is so full of beep, beep, beep, I can't even say it. I wish I could. I can say it, but I'm going to have to deal with, you know, the fallout after.Here's what he said.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. RICHARD BURR, R-NC: Was the FBI able to confirm any criminal allegations contained in the Steele document?JAMES COMEY, FORMER FBI DIRECTOR: Mr. Chairman, I don't think that's a question I can answer in an open setting, because it goes into the details of the investigation.SEN. SUSAN COLLINS, R-MAINE: I want first to ask you about your conversations with the president, the three conversations in which you told him that he was not under investigation. The first was during your January 6th meeting, according to your testimony, in which it appears that you actually volunteered that insurance. Is that correct?COMEY: That's correct.COLLINS: Did you limit that statement to counterintelligence investigations, or were you talking about any kind of FBI investigation?COMEY: I didn't -- I didn't use the term counterintelligence. I was speaking to him and briefing him about some salacious and unverified material.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: That proves, Jim Jordan, he lied.JORDAN: Yes.HANNITY: And when he signed the first FISA warrant in October of 2016, and then went to Trump Tower and I believe it was December of 2017 and said it's salacious and unverified, well, in the FISA application, bulk of information of the dirty dossier, he said it was verified. He's a liar.JORDAN: Yes, he told Gowdy during the deposition that President Trump wasn't under investigation when we know based on his document that but just 17 days into the investigation, they were investigating the president for no reason, no predicate whatsoever.He also told us during that deposition that after ten months, when he gets fired May 9th, 2017, they didn't have a thing. We knew they didn't have anything. He knew they didn't have anything.Clapper, Brennan, Comey, they've all said the same thing, there wasn't anything there, and yet they put the country through this.I also think it's important, Sean, look at the names on the front page Sara was talking about. Clinesmith, the guy who lied to the FISA court. Pientka, who handles the Flynn investigation who did this -- this interview as well, or this briefing, whatever you call it. And then, of course, Peter Strzok who ran the whole darn thing.Those are the three names on the front page, as well as Crossfire Hurricane, and imagine this come, Crossfire Razor. They were after Mike Flynn from the get-go as well. That's what the front page of this document that was declassified today. That's what it shows us.HANNITY: All right, thank you all. We're going to be watching.Mr. Durham, we're ready. It's time. You've got enough time now.Thank you all.Now, President Trump is coming up in mere moments, literally within the next 10 minutes I'm told. It was just announced -- he just announced today a bold, new expansion what is known as Operation LeGend. Why? To help combat the war zones, the crime, the anarchy that is literally wreaking havoc and killing innocent Americans and people are not safe and secure in their own towns, their own cities.But over there at fake news MSNBC, the conspiracy channel, Joy Reid, congratulations on your new time slot, saying rising crime numbers are fairy tale is not exactly accurate. Well, then, she invited Congresswoman Maxine Waters in to discuss insane conspiracy theories that Trump is invading cities with a parliamentary and secret police as the trial run for the coming election coup.Watch for yourself.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. MAXINE WATERS, D-CALIF.: As a matter of fact, it has been suggested that this is a trial run of the president of the United States, who may be organizing to not accept what happened when we have the election if he's not elected.JOY REID, MSNBC HOST: And he helpfully said the quiet part out loud by pointing out that the cities that will be in a sense invaded by Trump's secret police led by Democratic mayors.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: It's not just Maxine in Joy Reid show spouting these insane ideas. By the way, this is their next hoax. If they hear the words and have to choke on the words over there, we can now come project Donald J. Trump has been reelected the 45th president of the United States. You, the American people, you will decide that in 103 days. I hope you choose wisely.There is a lot at stake. Take a look.(BERGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: People are looking at potentially a trial run for a kind of genuine attempt to true intimidation and potentially through force to try to, to try to steal this election.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The problem here is, apparently, the president has this imaginary world in his head where he thinks the U.S. cities are under siege.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The idea that federal agents are in a city with Americans, that is not really the point here. This is like secret police snatching up Americans, taking them into cars.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: You know, I take a look at this psychotic story from the insane Washington compost. It says Trump's assault on election integrity forces question. What will happen if we refuse to accept the election loss?What will Joe do? How about that?The left is now willing to do, say anything to beat President Trump. They are in a full panic, I can tell you that tonight. And, buckle up, it is going to be an insane 103 days.Remember, Nancy Pelosi referring to federal agents in Portland, calling them stormtroopers. Jim Clyburn also in leadership in the Democratic House, comparing federal agents to Nazi Gestapo.Of the Democratic representatives claiming Trump is trying to start a race war. No, he's trying to save lives.In Seattle, that ever incompetent far left Mayor Jenny Durkan, remember the summer of love zone? Remember, it's an autonomous zone, the CHAZ, CHOP zone, the spaghetti pot luck dinner zone, telling fake news CNN that she was very unsettled. People died because of the stupidity of her not maintaining law and order.Take a look.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MAYOR JENNY DURKAN, D-SEATTLE: I have to tell you, it's so unsettling the president continues down this path. And I think it's unfortunate again the president is using federal law enforcement as a political tool. That is so dangerous for America.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: What's dangerous is, is that you allowed a mob, an anarchist to take over city blocks, including a police precinct four weeks. You called at the summer of love, spaghetti pot luck dinner zone.Well, I had to call come -- apparently, you didn't -- you take the time to call Horace Lorenzo Anderson Sr., who lost his 19-year-old son, killed in your summer of love zone. You wouldn't allow the police to restore order until -- well, let's see, that's right, what to young African-Americans were murdered in that zone. Many others injured.And according to a report, President Trump plans to send a tactical seem to Seattle as standby if the violent riots continue because she's allowing it.We got the same problem in Portland. We've got the dopey mayor there, the guy's name is Ted Wheeler. Loud riots now to fester there for 55 straight days. Apparently, Wheeler thinks this is mostly peaceful protesting.I saw a lot of rocks, bottles, graffiti, literally businesses shut down, total mess. Take a look.(VIDEO CLIP PLAYS)HANNITY: Ted Wheeler, does your city look safe and secure to you? Or I might just not believing what I'm saying?In fact, apparently, this dope once federal agents in Portland actually to go home, stop protecting the federal buildings that under law they're supposed to protect that were lit on fire last night. Ted Wheeler is totally detached like so many other liberals. You have all these liberal mayors. They have one thing in command. They have led their cities, no safety, no security and rotten educational systems for decades.He seems to think that there's absolutely nothing wrong with the anarchy playing out in his city. Last night, he was actually there in support of the anarchists, where ironically he ended up being harassed and stalked and assaulted.Democrats are now living in an upside down world. They vilify the police while the appeasing of violent rioters. They let violent criminals out of jail. There's no bail in New York, with those stupid policies. They trashed the president for trying to protect innocent life and send in help to stop the violence and restore law and order. And time and time again, they put politics and hatred of Donald Trump over the lives and safety of their own citizens.By the way, come November, well, you will let them take the reins of the entire country because only you have the power to stop it at the ballot box because Joe Biden is a guy that said, yes, the police have now become the enemy, and, of course, I support reallocating funds. Now, he's denying it, but he said it. We have the tape.Here with reaction, Fox\u00a0News contributor Dan Bongino, Fox\u00a0News correspondent at large, Geraldo Rivera, civil rights attorney, Leo Terrell.Geraldo, we begin with you.You know what, Geraldo, what I love about you, is you love your fellow human beings. You have been a street reporter as we say, all these years, trying to help people with better, safer lives.These cities aren't safe. Against all logic and reason, they won't allow any help to prevent violence and death. Why?GERALDO RIVERA, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT-AT-LARGE: Why? Because they are politicians and bad politicians. Ted Wheeler, the mayor there in Portland, booed off of the stage, ridiculed, they were yelling for his resignation by the time his attempt at street theater was over.Meantime, in Chicago, another 3-year-old child, another 3-year-old girl was shot yesterday. Ten people a shot total, three of them died. Three more murders in Chicago yesterday. And that is with all the heat on the gangsters.HANNITY: Yes.RIVERA: And the police superintendent there, David Brown, proud black man, got up there and announced to the world that there are ten times as many gangbangers as they were Chicago cops.HANNITY: Unbelievable.RIVERA: There are 12,000 Chicago cops, 117,000 gangsters. I mean, at what point do the people, the average citizens in that city just revolt? At what point do they say, screw you, mayor, we need all the help we can get? And even then it might not be enough.(CROSSTALK)HANNITY: Joe Biden is misleading them, Geraldo.All right. I'd just gotten the two-minute warning in my ear. That means the president will be taking over for you three, not that you are not great guests and good friends.Dan Bongino, you get the last 2 minutes.DAN BONGINO, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, just a quick piece of misinformation we have to correct here. These are not federal troops. They are federal agents. They are not unmarked. They do have markings.There are also federal agents -- to correct again, more liberal misinformation I've heard on cable news. There are federal agents, listening up, folks, in every major city in America right now. They don't need permission from anyone to enforce federal law. Whoever told you that is absolutely lying.So there you go. More liberal misinformation.HANNITY: Don't we want safety and security? Leo Terrell, one day, I'm going to pull out the old tapes, just for old times' sake of you being on the show and you and I disagreeing on pretty much everything.LEO TERRELL, CIVIL RIGHTS ATTORNEY: No.HANNITY: I'm going to pull out the tape of you ripping out your earpiece, throw it on your microphone.TERRELL: No, no, no, listen, let me get my minute. Let me get my minute end. Let me get my minute in.President Trump, this is Leo Trump 2.0. I'm telling you keep providing safety of these cities.CNN, MSNBC, you are lying to your Democrats. Look at the film footage that Sean just showed about these cities. You're lying. And if you -- stop having these commentators lie about the lack of violence. There's total violence.President Trump, continue to do your job. Law and order in these Democratic cities. It's ridiculous. Totally ridiculous.HANNITY: But apparently, we have an extra minute and a half.All right. Geraldo --TERRELL: Good.HANNITY: I -- well, I hate -- you know, you are all favorite people. So, I mean, you're my -- we're all best friends.But I really -- I want the president to act. He can't act, Geraldo, unless there's 15 mayors in all these liberal cities are saying, we don't want your help! What is -- what is wrong with these people?RIVERA: Chicago though, Sean -- if Chicago is the model, and the mayor is squawking about federal troops and the front door and accepting federal help in the back door. I'm OK with that. I'm OK with politics as long as they get the job done.How do you get the job done? You have to go after these organized criminal gangs and put them out of business, Sean.HANNITY: All right. The president is on the line, just for kicks and giggles.I want Leo Terrell, lifelong Democrat, I want you to tell the president in 30 seconds why you're voting for him and for the first time ever, right, for a Republican ever.TERRELL: Yes, President Trump, I want you to listen to me. Give me call me later on. The first time ever in my entire life as a Republican, I'm voting for you. Now, maintain what you're doing in these Democratic cities, and I will go to those networks and battle those guys for you. You're going to win in November, I guarantee it. I'm out there with you 24/7.PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP\u00a0(via telephone): -- very much. And you have come a long way, Leo. I have to tell you.(LAUGHTER)TRUMP: I've been watching you, and I've always respected even on the other side.(CROSSTALK)TERRELL: I'm here, I'm here. I'm here, I'm here now. I'm here right now! I'm here.TRUMP: I appreciate it, I do. I will do that.TERRELL: Thank you. Thank you.TRUMP: Thanks, Leo. Really great.HANNITY: All right. Leo, Geraldo, thank you, Dan Bongino.All right. I think that might have been the funniest we've had.Mr. President, sir, thank you so much for joining us. I know it's been a busy number of days here for you.A lot of news to get to. I want to spend a lot of time on the violence, the safety, security of our cities.TRUMP: Yes.HANNITY: I want to talk about COVID a lot.Let's start with some breaking news, and that is that you earlier today decided to pull back on the convention in Jacksonville. You gave a reason. Can you give us the reasons again in more detail?TRUMP: Well, it's really the China virus. Call it COVID. Call it any one of a lot of different names.But we're setting an example. We don't want to have people so close together. We have had such enthusiasm. Everybody wanted to go there. We went to North Carolina. We wanted to do it there. It was all set. We were going to build a beautiful facility. And it got hit hard. And the governor then, really, he could have treated us better, Democrat governor.But we are actually opening up there. And then we will make -- we will make our ways. It won't be your typical convention. I can say that, but it's going to be very safe.And I thought I had an obligation not to have large numbers, massive numbers of people crowded into a room.HANNITY: I have been told, Mr. President, from sources of mine -- you can confirm if you like -- I guess maybe I'm not surprised, that you're entertaining ideas that I have heard tonight that would be pretty spectacular.Would you give us any insight into what they are?TRUMP: Well, we have some ideas, but it'll have to be different than your typical convention.We have just great enthusiasm in the party. I don't think we have ever had it, even more so than 2016. And you see what's going on with the polls.Since -- it's funny. Since I did a -- I made a speech at Mount Rushmore. And since that time, it's been really something. There's been -- I mean, before that, really. You have all of these fake, these suppression polls, and just like 2016, when they put out these phony polls, the media.But I will tell you what. It's -- that the enthusiasm this party has and that they have for their president, because we're keeping our cities safe. We want to go in. We can't understand.I heard you talking with the group. Really, that's a group of -- a great group of three people. But I heard you talking about the cities and the safeties of the cities.I have offered them all, every one of them -- and there's 10 of them. We're offering all of them, let us go in. We will clean it up. We will clean it up.Now, in Portland, we had to do it because that was -- that's -- they're anarchists. That's even -- that's a level that people haven't seen, but they're anarchists.And they were going wild for 51 days. And we went in. And they have done a great job. They were going to rip down the courthouse, a big federal courthouse, gorgeous federal courthouse.So, we went in. And we have been very, very strong. And we have this Mayor Whalen (sic), who I think is also -- he's also the police commissioner, as I understand it, in Portland.HANNITY: Wheeler, yes.TRUMP: Mayor Wheeler.And he's -- he made a fool out of himself last -- he wanted to be among the people. So, he went into the crowd. And they knocked the hell out of him. That was the end of him. So, it was pretty, pretty pathetic.But we want to go in and help the cities. We want to help Chicago. We want to help all of them. Detroit's having problems. A very good police chief in Detroit, but they have problems.We will go into all of the cities, any of the cities. We're ready. We will put in 50,000, 60,000 people that really know what they're doing. And they're strong. They're tough. And we could solve these problems so fast.But, as you know, we have to be invited in.HANNITY: Mr. President, I want to ask you about that.TRUMP: At some point, we're going to have to do something that's much stronger than being invited in. But we have to be invited in.Go ahead, Sean.HANNITY: The acting DHS chief, Chad Wolf, there are statutory reasons and justification to protect federal buildings. That is what has been happening, when you talk about 100 agents.We now have 15 mayors. We see this rise in homicides and shootings. One day right here on this program a couple of nights ago, 15 people shot in Chicago, last weekend, 70 people shot, 12 dead, a 10-year-old, 11-year-old shot.You spoke to Horace Lorenzo Anderson Sr. I know you invited him to the White House. He lost his 19-year-old son. We lost an 8-year-old little girl in the CHAZ Autonomous Zone in Atlanta, a 1-year-old in Brooklyn, a 7-year- old little beautiful young girl in Chicago.And they -- the one thing that all of these cities have in common, they have been run by liberal Democratic mayors, liberal Democratic governors for decades.TRUMP: Right.HANNITY: What do you say to the people? Most people would argue, you don't have a chance of winning New York, or Illinois, or California, or Washington state.TRUMP: Well, you're right.They're run by very liberal people, you could say radical left in some cases, in some cases, just liberal Democrats. And they're not taking care of their police. They're not respecting the police. The police do an incredible job. It's a very tough job. It's a very dangerous job.And these mayors and, by the way, governors and senators and congressmen, Democrat congressmen, they want to pass stuff to make the police -- they want to take all of their power away. And you will have a bad situation, where you will have a bad cop, a very bad cop. And they have no idea the problem they cause.But you have 99 percent great people that work hard and get paid not nearly enough. And the job they do is incredible. And these people are just taking all of their respect. They're taking their guts out. And it's a shame. It's a shame.And the police, they could do the job. In Seattle, they could. They knew that we were coming in. And they went in just before we got there. So, we were all set to move. But if we weren't going to go in, if they thought that we weren't coming in, it would still be bad.But those police can do the job. But the mayor and everybody tells them not to do it. The governor, they say not to do it. And it's a philosophy.And let me tell you, if Joe Biden ever got in, the whole country would be like that. We have a lot of great cities. We have a lot of very safe cities, great places, great states that don't have any problems. And they look at the things that they see in Chicago, and they look at what they're witnessing in Portland and all of these different places, and they can't believe what's going on.But we have -- we have great places. But we have some instances that nobody's ever seen.I spoke with the mayor of Chicago, Mayor Lightfoot, and had a great talk. But within minutes after that talk -- you just reported it tonight -- a couple of more people were shot. Young, very young children were shot.HANNITY: Sad. So sad.TRUMP: And it's a shame. It's a shame.And we could solve it. If they invited us in, we'd go in with 50,000, 75,000 people. We would be able to solve it, like you wouldn't believe, and quick. But they just don't want to ask, maybe for political reasons. But they don't want to ask. It's a disgrace.HANNITY: Let me ask you, Mr. President.I know a lot has been made over Joe Biden and his comments that he made. I know he's now backed off it. And he says, well, I said it before the other way. I don't know if he's just not remembering what maybe somebody else wrote in \"USA Today,\" for example, but he did say police have now become the enemy, when they're supposed to help people.And then a follow-up was, would you support re-appropriating the money? And he said yes, now, not using the term. Democrats seem to be walking back the term defund. But reallocation is the word he used. Well, that would be the same thing.Let me play it, so to remind our audience what he said.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOE BIDEN, D-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Surplus military equipment for law enforcement, they don't need that.The last thing you need is an up-armored Humvee coming into a neighborhood. It's like the military invading. They don't know anybody. They become the enemy. They're supposed to be protecting these people.So, my generic point is that...UNIDENTIFIED MALE: But can we agree that we can redirect some of the funding?BIDEN: Yes, absolutely.One of the things that we also need to be doing is fundamentally changing the way -- and I have been pushing it for years -- changing the way we deal with our prison system.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: Mr. President, I can remind people, you're the one that did criminal justice reform. Biden, as vice president, Barack, they did not. You did police reform. They did not.You also set record after record low unemployment. They added 13 million more Americans to food stamps, eight million more in poverty, and the lowest labor participation rates since the '70s. You set record low after record low for every demographic group.And we got Opportunity Zones, your biggest commitment in terms of money and length of time to historically black colleges. They didn't do any of those things.Your answer to what Joe Biden -- now he's now -- he's adopting the position of the, yes, police are the enemies, he's never said a good word, Bolshevik Bernie's economic agenda, AOC's New Green Deal agenda. He's pledging trillions of taxpayer dollars.And add to that, let's see, Beto O'Rourke and Pelosi, Schumer and Biden, 125 years in the swamp. Your reaction to his team?TRUMP: Well, it's all true.But one of the things you mentioned and he mentioned was the surplus military equipment. And when I came in, as soon as I came in, I distributed to all of the police departments all over the nation. We had hundreds of millions of dollars of -- sometimes new, but it was never going to be used.It was sitting in warehouses all over the U.S. And I delivered it all to police, free of charge, all to police. It was just growing dust. It was just -- just sitting there, just, I guess, paying rent or whatever they were doing in all these massive warehouses.And I got it all out to the police. And they were so thankful. And, you know, a lot of it was protective equipment. And they didn't want to do it, because they thought the police looked too strong, that it was sending a wrong signal to the police.But it was really protecting the police. And there was offensive capability, but there was a lot of protective capability. And it was really amazing to me, what -- that they wouldn't deliver it, they wouldn't -- they wouldn't do it.And I -- and I have gotten notes. I have gotten so many notes from the heads of the police departments, and even from the cops, just the guys on the beat, thanking me for all of the equipment that we send out. And we were never going to use it. It was growing old and growing dusty.So, that's a whole different way of thinking, but -- and when he -- when you talk about the Bernie Sanders thing, I think what Joe Biden -- and I don't think it was him. I think it was radical left people that are totally controlling him, like a puppet. I don't think it's him. I don't think he knows even what we're talking about.But when we talk about Biden, he's got a manifesto that he agreed to -- I call it a manifesto -- with Bernie Sanders for open borders and things that you wouldn't even believe. I mean, these are left-wing at a level that I don't think Bernie ever talked about to the same extent.You would think there's a negotiation, that Bernie would be brought to the right a little bit. I think Bernie went further left, and Biden agreed to all of this stuff.HANNITY: Let me ask you.Sir, I have been in talk radio for 33 years, believe it or not, since I began that journey. I have been blessed to work here at Fox. I'm now in my 25th year here. Politics is a passion of mine.Usually, you have candidates -- you're probably an exception -- what you say -- what you said in 2016 is what you did. You...TRUMP: Yes.HANNITY: In many ways, people haven't figured out you're very predictable, in the sense that, if you say it, you mean it, in my view.But, usually, people run to the base for the primary, and then they run to the center. Joe Biden has adopted Bolshevik Bernie's radical socialism, AOC's New Green Deal. We're talking about trillions of dollars he's now committing to both those things, redistribution, higher taxes.Then I mentioned Beto O'Rourke, and then Schumer, Pelosi and Biden have had 20 -- 125 years.Why, in this case, do you believe he's going harder left than any candidate I have ever seen in my lifetime, for sure?TRUMP: Because I think he's afraid of the people on his left.I think that, when -- these are very radicalized people. I mean, he's gone so far. He's given Bernie everything. Bernie can't even believe it. I heard Bernie's going around saying, I can't believe what we got.And this was a negotiation that was done very quickly.And, today, I saw President Obama with him. And remember this. I wouldn't be there if it weren't for those two. If they did a good job, I wouldn't -- you know, I ran. I ran against what they did. And I won.And nobody campaigned harder than President Obama. Somebody said, oh, Obama's coming, and I said, that's OK, we beat him the last time. I think he campaigned harder than Hillary Clinton did, if you want to know the truth. Remember I would always talk about here comes Air Force One? Obama was all over the place.But the fact is, Biden and Obama, I'm here, I'm in the White House because of them. If they did a good job -- people forget, but if they did a good job, and except for the China virus that came in, we were setting every record you could set for unemployment, for the stock market, every single record you could imagine.And then what we did, we rebuilt the military. We got rid of regulations at a level that no administration even in eight years or in one case, more than that, no administration has come close. And we've appointed -- you know, we will have almost, it could even be more, but almost 300 federal judges appointed by the end of my first term. That's a record. Nobody's ever done anything like that. And two Supreme Court judges, great ones.HANNITY: All right. Let me go to Joe Biden. I argue, and I've watched this and witnessed this my whole professional life, I think that the job you have, I believe, regardless of who is president, is the hardest job in the world. You have a lot of burdens on your shoulder, anybody that is president. And I think when they asked Reagan in 1984 in that question whether or not he had the mental alertness, the strength, the stamina to do the job, it was a fair question.He answered it in one line in the second debate against Mondale. Let me play some of the greatest hits of Biden and then Biden from yesterday. And I want your take on what is going on with Joe Biden. Let's play it first.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)(PHONE RINGING)BIDEN: The scale, the scale of the loss is staggering. I don't know whose phone that is. But the scale of the loss is staggering.It has been two months since Congress gave them that money.Introduce me?(INAUDIBLE)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: OK. Yes, sir.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Am I on?BIDEN: Good evening.Thanks so much for tuning in.Look, tomorrow is Super Thursday -- Tuesday, and I want to thank you all.I'll tell you all, I'm rushing ahead, aren't I?We hold these truths to be self-evident, all men and women created by -- you know the thing.My name is Joe Biden and I'm a Democratic candidate for the United States Senate. Look me over, you like what you see, help out.Do you agree with me? Go to Joe 30330.We choose truth over facts.Play the radio, make sure the television -- excuse me, make sure you have the record player on at night, the phone -- make sure that kids hear words.Poor kids are just as bright and just as talented as white kids.Donald Trump does pose an extra threat (ph) to this -- it's not hypothetical.Why in God's name should someone who is clipping coupons in the stock market make -- in fact, pay a lower tax rate than someone who, in fact, is, like I said, a schoolteacher and a firefighter?I'm sorry, I'm confused who I am talking to here. But anyway, whoever it is...And I had a nurse that -- nurses at Walter Reed Hospital who would bend down and whisper in my ear, go home and get me pillows. They would make sure they would actually -- probably nothing ever taught in -- you can't do it in the COVID time, but they would actually breathe in my nostrils to make me move.Wearing a mask is now a political statement? This is more patriotic. Why do you wear the mask? So you don't make somebody else sick. Sick. What is with this guy?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Steve (ph), that's our time.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: OK.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: Mr. President, I'm not a doctor, I won't play one. I don't see -- I think Joe Biden has aged dramatically since he has left office. He doesn't seem very alert. They seem to be protecting him and hiding him. We now have interviews that are being shut off by handlers. What is your reaction, sir?TRUMP: Well, in all fairness, I know people that are 90, 91, 92 that are sharp as a tack. Bernie Marcus, as an example, Home Depot, and others I know, numerous. But you know, I just -- it's hard to comment on somebody. He is an opponent. You have to be very sharp. I'm dealing with the heads of these countries. And every one of them is a world-class chess player. And if you are not 100 percent on your game, if you are not 100 percent sharp- plus, you've got a problem.I looked -- I looked at what we have in this country. I came in and I guessed it from before, but after I saw what was going on with horrible trade deals, horrible military deals, money being spent, it was being sent out like water. You see what I have done with NATO, $140 billion, but really much more than that. It increases every year where countries are now paying for what we are doing. It was so unfair.So many different things, I could go -- and you don't have enough time. I could go all night with it. But you have to be on your game. You have to be sharp. And you have to be tough. And if you are not, these guys are going to take you to the cleaner.And they will take you to the cleaners like you have never seen before. It is so easy. And he wasn't -- he wasn't the best in his heyday.Let's not kid ourselves. Everybody knows that. Everybody knows that. Senators will tell you that in his best he wasn't. But I see the statements he is making now. And I don't think he has much of a clue.HANNITY: Mr. President, when you spoke about canceling the convention in Jacksonville, you were very passionate about it today. And you said the timing is not right. And we knew there would be flare-ups. This virus is the worst since 1918. And you said today, I have to protect the American people. That is what I have always done. That is what I always will be -- will do, that's what I'm about. We can make this work easily.And you also reminded people the importance of masks. People say you haven't been as outspoken as maybe you should have been on masks. But there were people telling us, well-known experts, not to wear masks in March for crying out loud, and socially distancing.And the CDC just released last week that if people wear the masks, this thing could be gone in four to six weeks. And what can you add about therapeutics and what can you add about a potential vaccine? You mentioned Pfizer today.TRUMP: Well, you know, at the beginning, many people, many very respected people, I won't mention names, but many respected people were saying don't wear a mask, that they're bad. You touch your face too much, and you get your hands near your eyes and your nose and they are bad.And then all of a sudden, it was a big thing to get masks because I'm all for it. Look, whatever is going to help, if it was a five percent chance, a two percent chance, wear it. And I will wear it. I wore it at Walter Reed Hospital the other day.I went to the hospital. I visited soldiers that have been so badly injured in Iraq. And it is terrible, in Afghanistan -- I saw one that was so badly injured in Afghanistan.And, you know, we are largely -- we're down to a very small force in both places. We were serving as policemen over there. And we can police our own country, especially when you look at Chicago and you look at what is happening around our country. And, you know, we have done a lot. We have done a lot.But you have to -- we have to do -- we have to get our country back. We have to get rid of this horrible plague that hit us and it hit us hard. But it didn't just hit us. It hit the whole world, Sean.The whole world was hit. China allowed it to escape to Europe and to the whole world, including us. And they are suffering. There's tremendous -- you know, you don't see that too much in the news, but you have countries that are going through relatively what we are doing plus-plus-plus. It is horrible.And we make ventilators because we have become -- we have become the best in the world for the ventilators. We're making thousands a month. We are sending supplies all over. And we are in -- we are in great shape from the standpoint. But we have this thing that is very, very contagious. Nobody has ever seen anything like it. Very, very highly contagious.But if you take a look at a map, we have large sections of the country that are in great shape. And we are going to win. And we are going to win sooner rather than later. I will say this on the vaccines, we are doing well. We have the greatest companies in the world, including we are dealing with other nations. We are working very closely.And therapeutically, therapeutics are, I think, going to be fantastic. Frankly, I would like to have that first because you could go into the hospitals, give somebody a shot or do whatever you have to do, and they would get better right away. But we are doing very well therapeutically. And we are doing very, very well with vaccines.HANNITY: Well, we know new studies have come out, and I had Dr. Oz on my radio show this week, that hydroxychloroquine, used early with azithromycin and zinc, and you took a lot of heat over it, mortality rate cut in half according to the Ford study. He mentioned a local hospital, retrospective study in New York.Let me add, you tweeted out tonight: baseball is back. By the way, poor Dr. Fauci -- and I really do believe and people I think try to divide both of you, that he has tried his best. Dr. Birx has tried her best. All of the models and experts in many, many ways were so wrong. The one thing that remained consistent is the most vulnerable, the elderly, those with compromised conditions or immune systems and pre-existing conditions.So I ask you, you know, where are we with the vaccine, the therapeutics? How soon? And do you want every American, if they can't socially distance, to wear the mask? I selfishly want baseball and football to open so we can go. And I also want to protect grandmas and grandpas.TRUMP: I would like to see everybody, if they can't spread, if they can't have -- be socially distant, then I think they should probably put it on. And even if it's -- let's say it's a 50 percent chance or 25, because, again, people -- these same experts were saying, don't wear it, at one point. Now they're saying wear it. So let's go with them. What difference does it make?So let's say they're right and let's say there's a 50 percent chance or 25 percent chance, you're not going to lose with it. You're not going to lose with it. So do it.But, again, as I said, I really think you're going to have some answers very, very soon on therapeutics and also on vaccines. These companies, I'm dealing with them directly, I'm getting reports directly. They are very far advanced. They've already started testing. And what I have done is through the FDA, Dr. Hahn, and some great people, we have ramped it up to a level that nobody has ever seen speed like this.We could be two or three years out before we are doing what we are doing. We are already testing. We are actually doing the testing for vaccines and for therapeutics. That would have happened in a normal administration, I will say that that would have happened in two and three years from now.So we are way, way advanced. And I think you are going to have some very good answers very soon. They're going to come up with the answer.HANNITY: Mr. President, you are asking the American people in 103 days -- well, some will be voting early. By the way, I have information on my website hannity.com, early voting, how do you do absentee voting, who your congressperson is that's up for election. In 103 days, I say the American people, the ultimate jury. You are asking the American people for four more years. If you are given the four more years, what will this country look like, in your view, four years from now?TRUMP: So it's all going to be about America first. We always put other countries before us, which is so foolish and so horrible. And it has been so destructive for us. It's about America first. We will help other countries, but we want to take care of ourselves. We are going to be building factories. We are going to be bringing in shops like you've never seen. We were all set to do it until we got hit with the virus.Our troops will be home. The endless wars are already ending. Down to very few soldiers in -- as you know, in Afghanistan. Very few in Iraq. Syria is largely out except we kept the oil. We have oil there that we kept. I didn't want to leave the oil, we kept it. We took it over.We are going to be about jobs like you haven't seen. We are going to be respected. And we are now by other countries. They're respecting us more than they have in many, many decades. I will tell you that. We are going to have a wall that is complete. We're up to 257 miles on the new wall. And by the way, if we didn't have that wall in right now, you would have numbers in Texas and in California, in New Mexico like you wouldn't believe.But we built 257 miles of -- it's 450 but we are going to do about 537 miles altogether. And it will give a complete, beautiful wall on our southern border that has really helped.And the other thing is, we are going to start making our product. And I have been pushing this from before this happened. We are going to make things here. We will make them here. Right now China and many other countries are doing what we are supposed to be doing. They went, they became globalists, these great geniuses became globalists. And they really hurt our country.We are going to start making it here. As with Elon Musk, I said, Elon, build a factory in Texas. He just announced today they're building one of the biggest plants in the world, auto plant for Tesla, and it's going to be in Texas. And, you know, it's great. He called me up just a little while ago to say, I got it done. So that meeting, he got it done. But I was pushing that job very hard from Elon, because we work with him and we do a lot for him. And I said, it's time. And he was great. He's doing a good job.But the other thing we have done is Space Force. You know, we put it in, it's the first time in 76 years we have a new force. We have -- so important, the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, Coast Guard, and now we have the Air Force. It's so great. And it's so important. It's going to end up being one of -- at first, I didn't even talk about that on the campaign. This was after I got in office.I realized we need it. Because China and Russia were going to dominate space. And we can't let that -- and now we're going to be dominating space. They're not too happy about what we did with Air Force. But we have it. And -- with Space Force.So we have now Space Force, so important, and so many other things, Sean, regulation cuts, tax cuts, the biggest tax cuts in history, biggest regulation cuts in history. And we are going to continue that foreword. There are still many things we can do. But the bottom line is we are putting America first and we are making America better than it has ever been.You will see that. We are going to have a great year next year. We're going to have a great third quarter. And the nice thing about the third quarter is the results are going to come out before the election.HANNITY: You know, I've been saying to my audience on radio and TV that the biggest choice election in our lifetime. It's literally, you know, taxes higher or lower, deregulation, more regulation, law and order, lawlessness, amnesty or border security, judges, energy, trade, foreign policy, it seems like you are running against the team. And the team is Joe, Bernie, \"Bolshevik Bernie\" I call him, Bernie Sanders the socialist, AOC, Green New Deal, Beto, Schumer, Pelosi, so I think it is.I want to go back to baseball. You announced today you are going to throw out the first pitch at Yankee Stadium on August 15th. Dr. Fauci did not do too well tonight with the Nationals. Have you ever thrown out a first pitch before? Are you nervous about throwing out the first pitch? Derek Jeter once famously said I guess to George Bush after 9/11, if you bounce it, you are going to get booed.TRUMP: Yes, no, I have thrown out first pitches. I have agreed to do it for the Yankees on I think they are playing the Boston Red Sox. That is a great rivalry. And I will do it. It's great that baseball is back, and other sports are back. I hope everyone is standing. I hope they are not going to be kneeling when the flag is raised. I don't like to see that. That would hurt a lot of people in our country. They don't want to see that with the NFL or baseball or basketball or anything else. We want to -- there are plenty of places you can protest. You don't have to protest on the raising of our flag.So a lot of great things happening for our country. One other thing I want to say is, we have made incredible trade deals. And we are going to continue that along. Because we got taken to the cleaners by every country. Ally or non-ally, we were taken to the cleaners. And we will keep that going.HANNITY: Mr. President, Mark Meadows, your chief of staff, recently indicated that indictments could be imminent in the Durham probe. We have big breaking news tonight. I don't know if you saw the opening of the show, a document declassified by your director of national intelligence, John Ratcliffe, revealing the FBI agent who gave you that defensive briefing in August of 2016 used it as a cover to monitor you and Michael Flynn as it relates to Russia.Do you remember it? It also, I believe, puts Jim Comey in a position of being proven to have lied just like when he said to you at Trump Tower the dossier is salacious but unverified. But he swore that it was accurate and true when he signed the FISA application to spy on you and your campaign and take away Carter Page's rights. What is your reaction to this news? And your thoughts on where this probe with John Durham is going?TRUMP: Well, it's just more and more things that you see. And that's only what you see. It is really bad. It is a terrible thing that happened. It should never happen to another president. The fact is that President Obama and Vice President Biden, and the whole group of them with Brennan and Comey and McCabe and Lisa Page and Strzok, her lover, and beyond them, long beyond them, they spied on the campaign, using the intelligence agencies of our country, they illegally -- this is illegal as can be, this is treason, this is many things you can call it, they spied on the campaign of another party or presidential campaign.HANNITY: And the attorney general.TRUMP: Both before and after victory. Both before and after. Never been done before. It is so bad. If it were the other side, they would have been in jail for two years, and it would have been a 50-year term. But Obama and Biden knew everything, and they spied on the campaign of the opposing party, using intelligence.HANNITY: Do you -- well, this raises a question. Now we know what happened in the Oval Office on January 5th. Do you think that Barack Obama, the former president, Joe Biden, should have to answer for what we now know happened 15 days before your inauguration in the Oval Office? We have one minute, sir.TRUMP: That was just one meeting. There were many meetings. There was no way -- I understand the system very well, I understand being president very well, there was no way this could have gone out without -- gone down without President Obama knowing every single thing.And even Biden brought up the Logan Act with respect to General Flynn, a great gentleman who has been treated so horribly and still is. A lot of -- a lot of things have been learned. And what happened is a disgrace. Again, should never, ever happen to another president.HANNITY: Would you consider pardons for the people involved? In the last 15 seconds.TRUMP: I've looked at a lot of different people, they have been treated extremely unfairly, and I think I probably would, yes.HANNITY: Mr. President, thank you for your time. In 103 days, the American people will make the ultimate decision. Sir, we appreciate you always taking time for this audience. Thank you.TRUMP: Thank you very much, Sean. Thank you.HANNITY: All right. That's all the time we have left.

Through our increased diplomatic presence, we hope to deepen our relationship with Greenlanders, including young people, better understand the issues that matter to them, and facilitate the expected increase in American tourism.As Secretary  visits Denmark this week to celebrate our work together as allies, we are pleased to highlight our partnership with Greenland and the entire Kingdom.Greenland matters to the  Administration because we share an interest with our allies and partners in protecting the Arctic and helping this unique region reach its potential in economic growth and sustainable development.Some examples of how we cooperate with the Kingdom of Denmark and other Arctic Council members are through agreements to prevent unregulated commercial fishing in the Arctic Ocean and by sharing best practices for eco-tourism and cruise ships. This collaborative spirit runs counter to the harmful actions in the region by Russia and the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), who want to expand their influence through aggression and unfair trading practices.Russia\u2019s aggressive approach in the Arctic was evident in 2007, when the leader of the Mir-1 submarine mission planted a Russian flag on the North Pole seabed and declared, \u201cThe Arctic is Russian.\u201dSince then, Russia has introduced new Arctic military bases with offensive capabilities, and even icebreakers armed with cruise missiles. Moscow has overstepped its rights and disregarded its obligations regarding the free navigation of maritime routes by blocking passage of other countries\u2019 ships and seizing control of new shipping routes opened by the region\u2019s changing climate.Meanwhile, Beijing has poured nearly $90 billion in its vision of a \u201cPolar Silk Road\u201d to advance Chinese Communist Party (CCP) military and economic interests in the Arctic. The Danish and Greenlandic governments, increasingly aware that the PRC\u2019s ambitions come at a high price, came together in 2018 to self-finance two new airports in Greenland. Denmark similarly scuttled an attempted Chinese purchase of an old American naval base in Greenland in 2016.In my five trips to Greenland as U.S. Ambassador to the Kingdom of Denmark, I have heard repeatedly from Greenlanders what the PRC and Russia never ask: What do the people of Greenland want for themselves? The vast majority told me they want to diversify their economy, attract foreign investment, and ensure the island\u2019s security, while preserving their cultural traditions and environment.The United States and Denmark are working together to help Greenlanders achieve the sustainable future they want. U.S. cooperation will help Greenland increase its capabilities in mineral and energy resource sector management, sustainable tourism, and economic growth.The U.S. private sector is looking to expand commercial ties with Greenlandic businesses like Royal Arctic Lines, KNI, and Air Greenland. We are also working with partners in Maine and\u00a0Alaska to increase trade in goods and services between the United States and Greenland, as well as investment.U.S. diplomacy in Greenland is committed to pluralism just as American society is at home, and seeks to respect the aspirations and cultural heritage of Greenlanders. American diplomacy is vastly different from the political and ideological submission demanded by authoritarian regimes in Russia and China.American expertise can assist Greenland as it strives to sustainably access its resource wealth. Greenland is known to house vast quantities of mineral and energy resources that, if developed with quality investment and sound regulations, could greatly benefit its people and their future. Greenland also has world-renowned fisheries and wildlife.The United States can help ensure Greenland\u2019s natural resource exploration occurs without damage to human health and the environment, and ensure that Greenlanders are the primary economic beneficiaries of the wealth beneath their feet.U.S. technological breakthroughs in renewable energy, electricity storage, and carbon capture have kickstarted environmentally sustainable economic growth in our country, and Greenlanders could benefit from this technology. Existing U.S. scientific research facilities in Greenland are cutting edge. Multiple generations of American scientists conduct research on the Greenland ice sheet to better understand and preserve the Arctic environment.Sensational headlines about renewed U.S. attention to Greenland have glossed over how shared our interests really are. As former Prime Minister of Denmark and Secretary-General of NATO Anders Fogh Rasmussen\u00a0wrote\u00a0in the Atlantic, \u201cGreenland should serve to highlight how many interests the United States and Denmark have in common. I consider Trump\u2019s interest in Greenland as a sign that his administration is taking a serious interest in the Arctic and its future.\u201dMr. Rasmussen is right, Greenland is a source of natural unity for the United States and Denmark. Through this new chapter in our friendship with Greenland and the entire Kingdom of Denmark, America hopes to promote a stable and secure Arctic, based on the rule of law, environmental protection, economic growth, and a common perception of the security challenges ahead.", "comment": "(112)", "topic": "OPINION", "date": " July 22"}, {"cover": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/03/156/88/mike-rowe.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "title": "Mike Rowe predicts skilled workers will be in 'demand like never before' in post-coronavirus era", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/media/mike-rowe-skilled-workers-demand-coronavirus", "subtitle": "\"Dirty Jobs: Rowe'd\u00a0Trip\" host Mike Rowe told \"Tucker Carlson Tonight\" Thursday that skilled laborers\u00a0\"will be in demand like never before\" as employers adapt to a post-coronavirus pandemic world.", "keyword": "U.S.-China trade and COVID-19", "website": "Fox News", "author": "Yael Halon", "content": "\"\" host\u00a0Mike Rowe told \"\" Thursday that skilled laborers\u00a0\"will be in demand like never before\" as employers adapt to a post- pandemic world.\"If\u00a0you have a skill that's in\u00a0demand, you are going to be in\u00a0demand like never before,\" Rowe told host Tucker Carlson, \"and\u00a0I've never been more certain of\u00a0that than I am right now.\"I've been pushing\u00a0this boulder up the hill for a\u00a0long time and I'm seeing some\u00a0things I haven't seen before,\" he continued, \"[like]\u00a0reinvigoration, and enthusiasm\u00a0around the basics of simply\u00a0learning a skill that's\u00a0absolutely in demand ... being essential, in other words.\"Rowe's foundation, the ,\u00a0provides workers with the resources and funding they need to develop a skillset and excel in their industry of choice.When asked what value he places on developing vocational skills\u00a0or picking up a trade, Rowe said it's paramount that those who wish to work have the chance to do\u00a0so\u00a0instead of\u00a0racking up student debt in a time of economic uncertainty.\"I've been talking a lot about\u00a0$1.5 trillion in student loans\u00a0on the books and the very real\u00a0fact that that's a millstone\u00a0around the next hundreds of\u00a0thousands of kids,\" Rowe said. \"People are getting that message,\u00a0but they're also now seeing\u00a0that there is a\u00a0difference between skills that\u00a0are in demand and education that\u00a0is not.\"\"It's not to say one is bad\u00a0and one is good, these are two sides of the same coin\" Rowe added. \"But\u00a0historically, we've tried to\u00a0separate those two things ...\u00a0and I'm telling you,\u00a0right now like never before, if you are a welder with a work\u00a0ethic, you will be among the\u00a0dozens of people making six\u00a0figures.\"", "comment": "(541)", "topic": "Fox News Flash", "date": " July 9"}, {"cover": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/07/156/88/AP20183324847327.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "title": "Massive 'ISIS drug bust' in Italy connected to the Syrian regime, not the terrorist group, analysts argue", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/world/italy-isis-drug-bust-syrian-regime-experts", "subtitle": "When\u00a0Italian authorities announced\u00a0last week that they had seized 15.4 tons of counterfeit Captagon produced by ISIS in Syria to fund terrorism it was lauded as one of the largest drug busts in history.", "keyword": "U.S.-China trade and COVID-19", "website": "Fox News", "author": "Hollie McKay", "content": "When\u00a0 authorities \u00a0last week that they had seized 15.4 tons of counterfeit Captagon produced by ISIS in  to fund terrorism, it was lauded as one of the largest drug busts in history.However,\u00a0many are now questioning the narrative with claims that the drugs stemmed from the Syrian regime and its much more extensive network of smuggling partners.The stash of 84 million pills, valued at an estimated $1.12 billion in market value and bound for distribution in Europe by \"different organized crime groups,\" was so aptly concealed in three container ships that airport scanners did not detect them, Commander Domenico Napolitano of the Naples financial police told the press.However, the seizure at Salerno's port was triggered after several calls by a local crime outfit were intercepted.Throughout its reign in  and Syria between 2014 and 2018, ISIS was known to issue Captagon - a combination of amphetamine and an array of other chemicals, sometimes referred to as a \"super-soldier\" pill, as it sends\u00a0fighters to extreme and euphoric highs, making them feel invincible on the battlefield. However, the terrorist group was not known to have manufactured drug, even at its territorial peak.Thus, multiple sources told Fox News that all fingers point to the Bashar al-Assad government in Syria and their Hezbollah affiliates, who have long been known to deal in drug smuggling circles and are well-entrenched in the global Captagon trade.\"ISIS today are small groups separated geographically in the deserts of Iraq and Syria, as they no longer have the ability to produce this huge amount of drugs,\" Turkey-based Syrian journalist and political analyst, Marwan Farzat, told Fox News. \"Nor does ISIS have the ability to import the active substance that goes into making the Captagon, nor the ability to bring this type of paper \u2013 flute paper \u2013 (that it was wrapped in.) Nor the ability to hide the drugs inside it because it needs huge and more high tech machines in order to hide or wrap the Captagon.\"The captured shipment in Naples is said to have originated in the Syrian port of Latakia, which is entirely under Assad's control. According to , Iran also leased part of the port last year and could also be profiting from trafficking.\"Exporting through the port of Latakia is something that ISIS is unable to do even at the height of its power,\" Farzat contended.This isn't the first cargo to have been thwarted coming from that very same location, and nor is it the first time the Assad family has been linked to the illicit industry.In April, authorities in Egypt discovered hashish veiled in milk cartons made by prominent Syrian businessman Rami Makhlouf, a cousin of Assad who \u2013 up until a recent falling out \u2013 was one of his closest confidantes. Two months prior, another confiscation of the drug took place , the point of origin also linked to the Latakia port.\"Billionaire Rami Makhlouf and Assad's brother, Maher Assad, and other family have long been involved in the drug trade. Maher works extensively with Hezbollah, and Hezbollah has a long history in the drug trade,\" noted Royce de Melo, a Middle East-based security and defense consultant. \"Backed by Syria and Iran for decades, Hezbollah is\u00a0Syria and the Assad family's front and channel to the criminal world.\"Last July, following a tip\u00a0from the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), Greek authorities unearthed 60 pallets of Capaton pills in Piraeus. Accompanying  showed that the narcotics had been boarded in Latakia.Saudi border guards also claimed to have foiled an attempt to sneak Captagon into the Kingdom this past Sunday from Jordan, of which Syrian analysts said has been used by regime accomplices in the past for drug missions.According to reports, Syrian pharmacists were trained to produce the drug by the Soviet Union for export during the Cold War era. Moreover, a former Syrian military official with knowledge of Damascus's inner-workings, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, affirmed that the tablets were carefully concealed inside paper rolls requiring professional-grade machinery and manufacture of which ISIS is not known to possess.The source further explained that traditionally, some of the ingredients are brought to the Syrian city of Homs to make the drugs, and some of the materials are distributed to Hezbollah connections in neighboring Lebanon.\"It is a combined effort between the regime and Hezbollah, but the transport happens exclusively under the Assad family's seaport,\" the insider said. \"For shipments to Europe, they usually go to either Greece, Italy, Malta or Albani. From there, they can enter and reach all of Europe.\"Farzat also noted that before the revolution, which was ignited in 2011, the ruling Assad family was in cohorts with the drug dealers in Syria, but at that point, they were not involved in the manufacturing of drugs.\"In April 2011, Bashar Al-Assad asked Major General Hossam Sukkar to set up four drug factories to export drugs to the Gulf countries and sell them at low prices there, (the idea was) to drown countries with drugs and destroy them as they try to sabotage Syria,\" he claimed. \"Now, there are a large number of factories for the Assad family, most of which are based in the Syrian coast area, including one in the village of Al-Bassa, a factory in the village of al-Sanawbar, a factory in the countryside of Qardaha, a factory in Homs, a factory in the countryside of Jableh, and a number of small workshops as well.\"Farzat said initially\u00a0the government's \"goal in the drug industry was not only material gain but to seek revenge against the countries that supported the revolution,\" in 2012. However, after the formation of pro-regime\u00a0national defense, the drug industry became one of the primary sources of funding for associated militias.Laila Kiki, executive director of Washington-based The Syria Campaign, concurred that the shipment came from an official port \u2013 far from where ISIS fighters are said to be scattered through the arid desert. She also stressed that while the stimulant has typically been associated with jihadists, Syrian soldiers have been known to consume it too \u2013 forcibly or otherwise.The Italian Ministry of Interior did not respond to a request for further comment, and it remains unclear whether any further investigation is still underway. Nonetheless, experts conclude that there are multiple reasons why fingers were quickly pointed at ISIS as opposed to Damascus.\"It is clear that Italian  groups must have been involved to move such a huge shipment of drugs,\" observed Jim Phillips, a senior research fellow for Middle Eastern affairs at The Heritage Foundation. \"Perhaps the Italian government concluded that attributing the smuggling to ISIS would inflict a higher reputational cost on Italian criminal groups participating in the smuggling than blaming Hezbollah or Syria.\"Tony Schiena, chairman of Mosaic Security, highlighted that it is merely easier to implicate a  group rather than a government.\"I doubt this (drug operation) is ISIS for many reasons and believe from\u00a0a logistics stand-point, Assad and Hezbollah have greater capabilities to move contraband materials like drugs,\" he explained. \"A government would definitely use proxies and secret funding mechanisms if they were to distribute or sell contraband for whatever reason to have plausible deniability.\"However, de Melo also underscored that the drug trade in the Middle East is far from clear cut, and enemies often work together to make a buck.\"This sort of business can get quite convoluted,\" he added. \"If this was an ISIS drug shipment, considering the way it was packed for shipping and the size of the shipment, maybe it was stolen by IS and resold.

And tonight, we lead with this story. The perfect storm started as the virus broke out in pockets of America this winter. Then we had the unprecedented lockdown that was put in place. There were concerns that the massive resulting unemployment could lead to unrest and instability and uprisings. That was hard to believe or imagine at that point.But now we've seen it as racial tensions poured gasoline on the instability. Now we see what was feared. It is happening in cities across America that are erupting in clashes of all kinds. Big and small, like this one between blue lives matter supporters and Black Lives Matter supporters.(VIDEO PLAYING)MACCALLUM: And then we have seen a huge jump in violent shooting deaths in Milwaukee and Kansas City and Philadelphia, in Chicago, New York, Los Angeles all have numbers that are up surprisingly.Hundreds are dead, including all of these children that you see on your screen in just the past couple of months. But you also remember when shots rang out in the halls of high school in Parkland, Florida, and then in a grammar school before that in Sandy Hook, Connecticut, there was understandable outrage at the deaths of those children rightfully so. And nationwide, calls from Congress to Hollywood to end gun violence.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)ELLEN DEGENERES, HOST, THE ELLEN DEGENERES SHOW: Enough.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Enough.JULIANNE MOORE, ACTOR: Enough.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Demand to plan.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Right now.SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER, D-N.Y.:\u00a0Let us resolve to do something, something about the epidemic of gun violence in this country.REP. NANCY PELOSI, D-CALIF.: The epidemic of gun violence in America. That's a national emergency. Why don't you declare that emergency, Mr. President?(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: So now, with some exceptions, we hear pretty much next to nothing about gun violence from some of these same people. 36 children were killed in primary and secondary school shootings in all of 2018 and 2019. Far too many. We have already covered the shootings and the deaths of dozens of children just since Memorial Day in this country. So, where is the outrage for these kids? Why do they seem to matter less to some people as the country reels in stress and conflict and murder?So, as New York Congressman Peter King watched this scene of Mayor de Blasio painting Black Lives Matter on Fifth Avenue in front of the cameras, he called that a publicity stunt, saying this under de Blasio is leadership, blacks are being murdered at a higher rate than at any time in almost 25 years. And here's President Trump at the White House earlier today.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: 358 percent increase in shootings in New York. Last month, over 300 people were shot. NYPD retirements have quadrupled and they're going up even further and New York City is out of control.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: New York City is out of control, he says. So, in a moment, Congressman King will join us. Also, on THE STORY tonight, John Ayala, the grandfather of this beautiful little boy, Davon McNeal. He was shot over 4th of July weekend in Washington, D.C. So, we're going to get an update on the four suspects there.Also, tonight, Trump Campaign National Press Secretary Hogan Gidley will join me on whether or not the Republican convention is going to happen, whether it will go forward in Florida next month, just few weeks away. And former attorney general now Alabama Senate candidate Jeff Sessions on the state of his primary race, which is tomorrow. And it's a hotly contested one in President Trump plays a big role in that situation. So, we'll talk to Jeff Sessions coming up tonight as well. But we begin, as I mentioned, with Congressman Peter King.Congressman, good to see you. Thank you very much for being here tonight.REP. PETER KING, R-N.Y.: Thank you, Martha.MACCALLUM: You know, I mean, it strikes me when we've covered a lot of these terrible stories of these young people like Davon McNeal, who was shot in D.C. and another young one-year-old who was killed this weekend in New York City. And you don't see the same kind of outrage for these children that we saw for the other children who were also mercilessly killed in those school shootings. Why do you think that is?KING: I think there's so much hypocrisy here, Martha. Whether it's a Black Lives Matter movement, whether it's progressive politicians like Mayor de Blasio and Governor Cuomo and Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez.The fact is that they are more interested I think in pushing a political agenda. I mean listen, everyone agreed, totally agreed that the murder of George Floyd was horrendous. So, since then, we've had riots and demonstrations. We had demonstrations in New York, against the NYPD. We should not have one questionable shooting last year at all, 36,000 cops, 35 shots were fired, the whole year. Only 35 cops even fired the weapons last year. There were five African Americans killed and four of those five had guns or knives. So, far more white shot than blacks in New York.So, all these demonstrations out in the streets denouncing the cops, cursing at the cops, throwing bricks at them, Molotov cocktails. That again was allowed to happen and encouraged. And that encourages the violence. As a result, the cops that's slowly pulling back, there's restrictions put on them as what they can do. They can't even get somebody in a headlock. And as result of that, the thousands of lives that have been saved in the minority communities are now being lost.I mean, I guess maybe 350 shootings since Memorial Day in New York and over 75 murders. 98 percent of the shootings were committed against minorities. And 100 percent of the murder victims are African American. And they would turn their own communities. And that's what the cops have been able to prevent over the last 25 years. But because of these progressive policies and paging Black Lives Matter, which is a radical, as far as I'm concerned, semi-terrorist organization, they're focusing on that and ignoring the fact that innocent black kids - last night, a one-year-old kid was shot down in the streets of Brooklyn at a family outing.MACCALLUM: As you say, there's a very wide spectrum when people say Black Lives Matter. You know, you've got, kids wearing T-shirts that say Black Lives Matter, suburban homes with signs on their front lawn. And then you've got the radical element that is at the heart and the core of it, which is an admittedly Marxist organization. So, it's a very wide spectrum when people use that phrase. I just want to point out.Here's Mayor de Blasio because he did comment on the death of Davell Gardner this morning. And here's how he talked about it. Watch this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BILL DE BLASIO, MAYOR OF NEW YORK: It's heartbreaking for so many reasons. And it begins with the fact that there are just so many guns out there and that is a New York tragedy and a national tragedy.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: Is that the problem?KING: The guns are on the street now because the cops have been pulled back. The cops took more guns off the street over the last several years that can be imagined. But now that unit which was going after guns has been disbanded because it was considered too offensive.So, yes, there are guns on the street, and they're being used by the bad guys. And I wish Mayor de Blasio realize that when he went after the cops, every person in New York should thank the NYPD for the job they've done, especially the African Americans, the minorities living in those communities, which they are the ones whose lives have been saved.We went from 2000 murders a year, the overwhelming majority were black and Hispanic. Now, that was done under 300 last year. Now it's gone back up again. So again, these people who - they have blood on their hands, these politicians, and media people - in New York today and the media stories in the local news, the shooting of that boy, he was like fourth or fifth down. The main story was that somebody threw red paint on the Black Lives Matter side in the middle of the street. That shows how our priorities out of whack. And we got to turn this around or the country is going to be lost.MACCALLUM: Peter King. Congressman, thank you very much. Good to have you here tonight.KING: Thank you, Martha.MACCALLUM: Joining me now, Juan Williams, Fox News Political Analyst, and co-host of The Five. Juan, great to have you with us as well. What's your reaction to that?JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS HOST: Thank you.MACCALLUM: Because we talked so much and we heard so much from, you know, as I said, from members on Capitol Hill to Hollywood folks about these horrific school shootings. And yet we don't hear from them about these children being killed in the middle of this, because the narrative that goes along with it doesn't necessarily fit the things that they seem to be wanting right now.WILLIAMS: I see it a little differently.MACCALLUM: OK.WILLIAMS: I mean, I think obviously, after what we saw in Newtown, after what we saw down in Florida at that high school, and I could go on. Nothing gets done. Even President Trump was saying, you know, we can do something here. He's going to get a deal with the NRA, and nothing gets done.And now you're focusing on, you know, the easy availability of guns in cities that often have strict gun control laws, but they can't control neighboring states and guns flow in the market of illegal, the black market of illegal guns.MACCALLUM: But here's one of the problems with that--WILLIAMS: Aggressive and active.MACCALLUM: That Peter King just mentioned. And, you know, I had a conversation with a former New York City detective who was part of that plainclothes force when he was on the force. And this discussion I had with him was back in, I think it was probably April and when that decision was made that that group was going to be disbanded. He said, you watch what's going to happen this summer in the city. It's going to be horrific because those plainclothes police officers are the ones who get those guns. And in many cases, drugs attached to them off the street.So now, what you've got is basically gang warfare, being able to play out because they know that there's nobody on the street who is a police officer who's not dressed as a police officer. So, they have nothing to fear. These guys in the video that I saw of them coming out and shooting this young boy was so unbelievable.So, they are operating, these gangs are operating in an environment that is much more open and easy for them at this point, Juan.WILLIAMS: Well, I don't know why that unit was disbanded, Martha. But I will say that you have a situation right now in the aftermath of the George Floyd video, where everybody, including Peter King, I will say it was horrific what happened, that you have a police officer kneeling on a man's neck and killing the man like that. So, I think there's more scrutiny and more questions about what we - the authority, the power that we give to police and how they act and behave. So, I don't know that it's necessarily related to the disbanding of this unit that you are talking about that was pulling after guns.MACCALLUM: Well, that was part of the reason that that unit was disbanded because the thinking was that they were walking around--WILLIAMS: They were just disbanded since then?MACCALLUM: Oh, yes. They were disbanded in early May, I believe. And this force of 600 police officers who used to walk around New York City getting guns off the street as undercover police officers, it was determined that they were not fair, that they weren't playing the game fairly and that they needed to be redistributed.WILLIAMS: Well, I don't know.MACCALLUM: Well, that's what happened. Mayor de Blasio wanted that whole group disbanded.WILLIAMS: Well, here's what I think. Well, here's what I think. I think that's a pretty short-term consequence. But my sense is that you have here - my sense of it is, first of all, that this is not as was described by Peter King. First of all, Black Lives Matter. I don't think most Americans would identify them as any terrorist organization. I think that what you have is overwhelming protest against abuse of power by police and bad apples in the police department that need to be reined in that the police--MACCALLUM: But the result, Juan.WILLIAMS: People who protect bad cops.MACCALLUM: But the result is that you are seeing these children get killed and people get murdered in our cities in America because the police have been told to pull back.WILLIAMS: That's not what I think. I think you have, first of all, in black and brown neighborhoods, low income black and brown neighborhoods with the summer, with the fact that people were pent up with the Coronavirus. Now that you have this explosion and it is horrific. And guess what? There are lots of people who are not involved, like these children who get killed, Martha. And it's just tragic and it's wrong.And I hope Black Lives Matter would stand up and say that's wrong and that this kind of murder, as you see it, mostly black on black is not good. It's terrible. And the people inside the black community, my community should be outraged about it, just as we're outraged over abuse of police power.But to somehow tie it and say, oh, police aren't doing their job. First of all, I think police take an oath and I respect the police and I think they do their job. So, it's not their responsibility. You had some thug or gangster or a drug dealer pulling a trigger.MACCALLUM: There's clearly less interaction because police officers hesitate. And that I mean - I think that's pretty well known in many of these departments. They'll tell you that they think twice about entering certain situations because they don't want to end up being that guy. And, you know, everybody understands that what we saw with George Floyd was horrific. I think there's universal opinion on that and on any similar situation.But what's happening is that people are dying as a result of the policies that we're seeing play out here. And I think that, you know, this this is a situation where all these little children's lives matter immensely and we need to think twice about it. So, I thank you very much for being here tonight, talking to me. Thanks, Juan.WILLIAMS: You're welcome. That's a good conversation.MACCALLUM: Good to see you, Juan. So, coming up, President Trump today insisting that his nominating convention will happen, but there are reports that some in the campaign are wondering, is it really worth it? Do people decide who to vote for based on these big conventions? 2020 Press Secretary Hogan Gidley here on that and more. And then Karl Rove and Chris Hahn will weigh in on these polls that we're seeing in Texas and in Florida where COVID-19 has dug in. Coming up next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Are you going to be able to hold the convention in Jacksonville with all this virus spreading?TRUMP: Well, we're going to see it built up a little bit, but we're going to do something that will be great.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: President Trump pressing ahead with plans for the Republican convention in Jacksonville, Florida, as his state deals with a surge in COVID-19 cases. There are some growing questions about what this convention may actually look like in the end. Here now, Hogan Gidley, Trump's 2020 National Press Secretary with a new title at the campaign. Hogan, good to see you tonight. Thank you very much for being here. So, 100 percent definite convention in Florida?HOGAN GIDLEY, TRUMP 2020 NATIONAL PRESS SECRETARY: We're looking to move forward with it in Jacksonville. The President's very excited about it. But, of course, he wants the American people to be safe. He cares about the health and safety and security of the people that would come to that convention. And there'll be a lot of them, I can promise you that. But we're working with people on the ground, too, with Governor DeSantis in his office, the mayor as well, the RNC, all the local officials. And quite frankly, the health experts, because we want to make sure if we proceed forward, how it looks and the measures that need to be in place to make sure that when this thing goes off, it goes off safe.MACCALLUM: So, if we proceed, I heard in there, so it sounds like there is an opening that this might not happen. Are there people within the campaign who are arguing for? Look, it doesn't matter. We can do this a different way this time around.GIDLEY: No, people are excited because they want to see this this convention happen. It's been you know; this country has seen an unprecedented, unforeseen crisis in the pandemic coming from China. And as we work our way through this and we put the health measures in place to make sure the American people are safe, it's time to get back out and enjoy life. And one of the ways we can do that is with this convention.But at the same time, as I said, the president cares about the health and safety of the American people. So, we're going to proceed in the best way possible.MACCALLUM: All right. So, what's the likelihood that you're going to do something outside and that there will be social distancing at this event? I know there were a couple of places that have been looked at outside. It was something that a lot of people thought maybe should have been considered right up - out of the gate. And why wasn't it?GIDLEY: Sure. Well, look, we're looking at all the options out there. The President wants to go into the great state of Florida. One of the states, a pundit said he could never win. That helped catapult him into the White House and thank them for all of their hard work. They want to hear the man speak, you know as well as I do, whether it's a rally or a convention speech. People will do anything and everything to get in and hear this man and cheer him on and thank him for improving their lives.And when you look at the vision the President is putting forward of a great America, making this country get through this pandemic and better on the backside of it, the uplifting, patriotic message he has. And compare and contrast that with Joe Biden, who wants to defund the police and thinks America is now in the cause of all the problems--MACCALLUM: You say a lot of people want to turn out and they always historically have. You know, obviously the crowds at these rallies have historically been enormous. But Tulsa wasn't a great experience, then New Hampshire got canceled. So that has to be forcing a little bit of a different conversation at the campaign right now.GIDLEY: Look, again, I would argue Tulsa was successful. 11 million people saw that thing. That's incredible. Broke all kinds of record.MACCALLUM: On TV.GIDLEY: I think New Hampshire just because of the weather. Listen, we want to proceed, but we want to do it in a proper way. The President cares about the safety and security of the American people, as I said. And so, we'll look at all options. But the fact is, we're moving forward with this convention in Jacksonville. We want people to be safe. And we're looking forward to getting the President's message out there.MACCALLUM: So, one of the other messages that has been out there is, you know, sort of where to place the blame for some of the numbers that are a little soft right now and we're early out. I think a lot of people don't make up their mind about these things till well after Labor Day and certainly after these conventions, if they happen and the debates are going to be a huge data point here as well.But the things that have floated out from even members of the task force is and from the President as well, a little bit of finger pointing at Dr. Fauci, like, well, you know, maybe he should have told us earlier to wear masks. Then also finger pointing at the head of the campaign, Brad Parscale. There was a piece in The Washington Post today sort of suggesting that there's some blame going in that direction. Is that fair?GIDLEY: No, it's not. I'm going to break some news on your program tonight. I'll give you some numbers that no one knows. And that's this, to all of our media platforms right now, we just eclipse a milestone. No one knows about this. So, again, just for you, Martha, 1.1 billion views of our show we put forth on the Trump networks. 107 shows, the President has only participated in a few of them. The excitement is out there. People are engaged. They want to get out and vote for this President.And when you see the numbers of registered Republicans outpacing that of Democrats in key swing states, we're doing something right. Money raised at a pace no one thought possible. And it's because we have a great candidate. Make no mistake, when you're talking about Joe Biden, you don't have to guess what his economy would look like.You saw it for eight years, depressed wages, jobs leaving shores, 3 million of them go into China alone. You don't have to guess what the culture would look like. He pops out of his basement every once in a while, to say defund the police. The fact is, our jobs aren't safe, our families aren't safe, and our American way of life is not safe with Joe Biden, because he is waging war on all three policies.MACCALLUM: A very different reality right now. And everybody's forced to kind of think creatively and do their business in a creative way. And I think that works in the campaign environment as well. And we'll see how it all plays out. Hogan, thank you very much. Good to have you here tonight.GIDLEY: It does. Thank you.MACCALLUM: Next up, Karl Rove, former Deputy Chief of Staff to President George W. Bush and a Fox News Contributor. Chris Hahn is a former aide to Senator Chuck Schumer and a syndicated radio host. Good to have both of you with us tonight.CHRIS HAHN, FORMER AIDE TO CHUCK SCHUMER: Great to be here.MACCALLUM: Karl, what do you think? Does the convention have to happen, and does it have to happen in Jacksonville? Does it have to happen the way it usually does? What do you think?KARL ROVE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, it won't happen the way it usually does, because typically these are gigantic festivals for the Democrats and Republicans. Lots of donors, lots of activists, lots of interest groups. They swarmed the convention site. They go on for a week or two before the convention begins. There are enormous crowds during the convention. Many of them never get into the hall, but they go to the parties. They go to events. They go to the satellite. You've seen them. You've been at a couple of these.MACCALLUM: Yes, I've been at a lot of them.ROVE: That's not going to happen.MACCALLUM: Yes.ROVE: And it's going to be a slimmed down version. The key is going to be, can the Democrats and the Republicans both figure out how to showcase their candidate's acceptance speech, because typically, historically, going back to the beginning of the TV age, the moment of the acceptance speech is the most watched point of the campaign, except the presidential debates. And so, as they're going to be looking for ways to do that, it's going to be interesting to see how they deal with it in a time play.MACCALLUM: It's going to be fascinating. I mean, they've only got a few weeks to hammer this out. And I think, you know, everybody's got to put it their creative hats on and come up with something that is going to, you know, really wow people, and get them to tune in.Let's take a look at some of these polls and get Chris's reaction. And then Karl's reaction. So, the first poll that we have is - what do we have there? Texas. Arizona. There is Arizona, Arizona is flat. 46-46. Florida has Biden up by 6 points right now. And Texas has Trump up by only 1 point. Chris, have at it? What you see there?HAHN: Well, you know, I told Karl on this program a few weeks ago that Texas is going to be in play. Texas is going to be in play. The average of polls in Texas right now is 0.1 percent for Trump on the average of polls. I think Biden is going to win Texas especially, hopefully somebody senior in the Bush family will come out and endorse Biden in Texas. That will put him over the top. I don't know if George itself, but it's going to happen.MACCALLUM: So, Karl is that going to happen? Is George Bush going to come out and endorse Joe Biden.ROVE: You know, it's an unusual for a major media figure like Chris Hahn to visibly demonstrate that he's smoking dope on television. It's amazing. I mean, it's really--HAHN: Hey now.MACCALLUM: Chris, you're not smoking dope, are you?ROVE: The American people can believe that Texas is in play. The American - no, obviously, I'm kidding. But he is, like, weird. So, we can believe that Texas is absolutely in play when Joe Biden comes down here and buys a lot of TV and appoints even a state chairman.HAHN: He's going to.ROVE: Let me finish, Chris, please, for once, for God's sake, please.MACCALLUM: Go ahead.ROVE: So, but until that happens, we can - look, the state's going to be close. No ifs, ands or buts about it. But the idea that this is a state that is in play and is a top target of the Democrats, I have yet to see, you know, they're not even a Biden state chairman. There's no staff on the ground. There's no TV buys. There's no--HAHN: Here's why?ROVE: It's not there.MACCALLUM: Final thought, Chris.HAHN: Here's why it's in play. Abbott and Warso (ph) Dan Patrick, two Trump clones have ruined the recovery to COVID-19, in Texas. It has made more people's lives in danger and it has endangered the economy of Texas and the nation as a whole. So that just--ROVE: I just saw a poll looking at that and Governor Abbott's approval rating at 66 percent approval rating. He didn't like your Governor Cuomo. He did not send people with COVID to nursing homes--(CROSSTALK)MACCALLUM: You go ahead.HAHN: Please, please Karl. Karl, you're going to need multiple whiteboards to figure out a map for Donald Trump to win this presidency. He's such a failure. He's failed on so many levels in so many states. I am so dizzy--(CROSSTALK)ROVE: You've got to get a new rap. We keep hearing this every time we're together.MACCALLUM: We're going to keep this--(CROSSTALK)ROVE: Say something substantive--MACCALLUM: I think it's similar conversation. I'm not exactly sure if it was with you, Chris Hahn. But I know Karl Rove said that Beto O'Rourke would never win Texas and that he could see that that was never going to happen. And, you know, so here we are or--ROVE: Martha, one thing here.HAHN: As bad a candidate--ROVE: One thing before we go. Chris said that Biden is going to win Texas. I want to bet a $1000 Chris's favorite charity, not a political group, but a charity. If he'll bet a $1000 to my favorite charity, that I say Biden doesn't win Texas. He says Biden does. Let's see if he's going to man up right now.HAHN: I need odds, Karl. I need odds.(CROSSTALK)MACCALLUM: All right, bye guys. Talk to you next time. All right. Coming up, Dr. Scott Atlas says that science proves he's very emphatic about this. He says schools absolutely must reopen and he says the science demands that they do. He's back with his argument right after this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: Schools should be opened. Schools should be opened. Kids want to go to school.(END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)MACCALLUM: The latest political divide appears to be going back to school with Democrats mostly urging caution and Republicans mostly, starting with the president, saying that kids need to get back into the classroom or risk a learning loss that maybe irreparable.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. NANCY PELOSI, D-CALIF.,\u00a0SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE: Going back to school presents the biggest risk for the spread of the coronavirus. They ignore science and they ignore governance in order to make this happen. If there are CDC guidelines, they should be requirements.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: Dr. Scott Atlas, senior fellow at Stanford University Hoover Institution and former chief of neuroradiology at Stanford University Medical Center. Doctor, welcome back to the program. Good to have you.SCOTT ATLAS, PROFESSOR AND CHIEF OF NEURORADIOLOGY, STANFORD UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER: Thanks, Martha.MACCALLUM: She says, Nancy Pelosi says that this is the biggest risk to the spread of the virus if the kids go back in September.ATLAS: I think we have a different scale because that's just completely wrong and contrary to all the science. And when I say, when I say all the science, I'm talking about signs all over the world not just in the United States but Switzerland, Sweden, Canada, France, the Netherlands, Australia, Asia.I mean, it's totally contrary to the science and here's the science, I'm not sure how many times it has to be said but the risk to children from this disease for fatality is nearly zero. The risk to children for a significant illness is, quote, \"far less from seasonal flu\" according to JAMA Pediatrics.I mean, this is totally antithetical to the data. And the other thing that we have to, obviously we know this by now it's been confirmed all over the world. Children rarely transmit the disease to adults. This is --(CROSSTALK)MACCALLUM: Well that's the biggest concern, if -- pardon me for hopping in, but that's the quickest rebuttal to that. That, you know, yes, but these kids aren't going to realize their carriers, they're going to go home and infect their parents or their grandparents.ATLAS: Well, but those are people that obviously either don't know the data or are refractory to learning themselves because the facts say otherwise. And this has been proven by contract tracing all over the world by studies on these kids. This is like really ludicrous.But I think the most important thing of all, well, the other -- there's two points that I want to make. One is that teaching is a young profession. In the United States half the teachers are 40 or less and a quarter of them are under 30. Ninety percent are under 60 in public schools.They have almost zero risk from this and for those high risk teachers, which there are some, if they believe in masks and social distancing, don't think they know how to do that by now, and if they're still afraid to do their job, why can't they teach from a distance? If they think social distancing works, teach in a class, if they think a distance learning works, teach from home.But the problem here and this the biggest point of all, I never hear anyone talk about the harms of closing schools. The harms are against the children. Anyone who prioritizes children would open the schools. That's just counterfactual to say that, you know, the children are not the risk or, you know, were at risk here.When we see the harms to children, most children learn most of what's in schools from social engagement, from learning how to resolve conflicts from dealing with others.MACCALLUM: Yes. So true.ATLAS: This is obvious. When children learned that they need a hearing aid or glasses, that's done in school. There are over almost a quarter of a million apparently reported child abuse cases --MACCALLUM: Yes.ATLAS: -- missed because children's child abuse is most noticed in the schools. And so, I mean, I'm not sure. We are the only country in the world, this is a level of hysteria like this is something I feel like I'm living in a Kafka novel here. I mean, I get thousands of e-mails a week from all over the world, from professors, teachers, mothers in the United States and elsewhere, they are stunned that we are willing to just simply destroy our children out of some bizarre notion that is completely contrary to the science.MACCALLUM: Yes. I mean, we watched some countries in Scandinavia that went right back. The kids all went right back and they did very well. So, this is really important, you know, that the kids they -- the learning deficit is so dramatic and we're going to talk to Betsy DeVos about this later in the week.But Dr. Atlas, I got to go but thank you so much. Always good to have you with us.ATLAS: All right.MACCALLUM: Coming up, former Attorney General Jeff Sessions served in the United States Senate for than 20 years and now he faces the fight of his life to get back there after an ugly divorce from his time in the Trump administration. Remember this?(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP:\u00a0They put this country through, Jeff Sessions was a disaster. He was a total disaster because he basically let it happen, unknowingly, because he is not very smart.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: Well, he see that criticism quite a bit from the president. He is here tonight to talk about that and about his Senate race hours ahead of a crucial run-off in Alabama, coming up next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)MACCALLUM: Ever since Jeff Sessions left his attorney general post President Trump has been trashing his earliest Capitol Hill supporter. Now the president is backing Sessions' opposition Republican Tommy Tuberville in tomorrow's primary runoff tweeting this. Big Senate race in Alabama on Tuesday, but T. Tuberville he is a winner who will never let you down. Jeff Sessions is a disaster who let us all down. We don't want him back in Washington.To which Jeff Sessions clap back, I've taken the road less traveled, not sought fame or fortune, my honor and integrity are far more important than these juvenile insults. Your scandal ridden candidate is too cowardly to debate, as you know Alabama does not take orders from Washington.Joining me now, less than five more hours until runoff date, Jeff Sessions, former attorney general and 2020 Alabama Senate candidate. Good to see you, sir. Thank you very much for being here tonight.JEFF SESSIONS, FORMER U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL: Thank you, Martha.MACCALLUM: We have a poll from May, I want to point out that this is a very old poll but there are several polls that show you double digits behind Mr. Tuberville. How are you feeling as you head into tomorrow given that?SESSIONS: Thanks. I'm moving our way there's no doubt about it, our campaign is catching fire people are finally beginning to ask who is our opponent? Where did he come from? He just passed through Alabama 18 months ago. He claimed for tax purposes his home in Florida. He is wrong on trade, wrong on immigration, wrong on China.He's not been advocating for the Trump agenda that I have been advocating for. His name is going to be on the ballot tomorrow, not President Trump's.MACCALLUM: OK.SESSIONS: We'll be voting for him in November but the choice is clear. My opponent is hiding out, he rejected coming on your program. He rejected Bret Baier's program, he's gone radio silence in the state --MACCALLUM: All right.SESSIONS: -- since the scandals have broken there.MACCALLUM: Let me ask you this. You know, it's interesting that you say that you -- one of the things that you would do if you get to go to the Senate would be to defend President Trump's policies. Even though every chance that he gets he tries to undermine you in this campaign. How do you do that?SESSIONS: The president has strong feelings about this and he gets to express those opinions, but let me tell you. I was for those policies before he announced. I was the number one voice in the Senate for them. I believe in them. Not because of any personal gain but because I think they're right for America and Alabama.He needs stronger voices in the Senate. The Senate is not speaking out sufficiently on trade, on immigration, on China. Those are particularly difficult issues. Judges. Religious freedom. Those things, I know about, I fought for, I understand them. I'll help him, I want him to succeed.MACCALLUM: OK.SESSIONS: That's the fundamental thing because it's good for America.MACCALLUM: So, interestingly, I want to ask you a question about what happened with Roger Stone and the commutation which is obviously been a controversial decision. And it's interesting that last week the person who came out after you, Attorney General Bill Barr said that he -- he was asked about the Stone sentence and he said that he thought the sentence for him was fair given the crime. And he also said that he thought that it was a righteous prosecution. Do you agree?SESSIONS: Well, I don't know the details of that case. I would just say the president clearly has the power to pardon. President Obama did 200. One of them was a terrorist who was teaching people how to make bombs to blow up the United States.So, the president has this power. I respect Attorney General Barr. I like the fact that he's digging into all these matters, these allegations of unfairness and federal abuses in FBI and prosecutors. I think this matter, this Russia matter, can never be completed until the American people have a belief that the investigators themselves have been evaluated properly and wrongdoing punished wherever it occurring.MACCALLUM: All right. Former Attorney General and Senate candidate in Alabama, once again, Jeff Sessions. Thank you very much. Good to see you, sir.SESSIONS: Thank you.MACCALLUM: So, this little boy is 11-year-old Davon McNeal. He was shot and killed by a stray bullet during a Fourth of July peace cookout that was organized by his family to bring people together in his community. He's quite the young athlete, had a bright future ahead of him.One of the suspects connected to his murder was recently released from prison because of COVID-19 and they wanted to let people out. Davon's grandfather, John Ayala who you met here last week wants to update us on what's going on in this case. He says that a violent offender never should have been let out of prison. He is here next. Don't miss it when we come back.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: He shot my baby in his head. He got shot in his head. It looks so bad.(END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOHN AYALA, DAVON MCNEAL'S GRANDFATHER: He gets out of the car, shots ring. He hits the ground, Crystal looks and saying get up. You don't get up, so she goes to see what's going on and realize that he was hit with one of the bullets that was being shot.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: That's the grandfather of a 11-year-old Davon McNeal describing the senseless shooting that took the life of his grandson over the Fourth of July weekend. When asked about Davon's football coach said, quote, \"we just had a real genuine kid who wanted to get out of the neighborhood. That's all he said, is I'm going to make it.\"There are four suspects at least connected to Davon's killing, two have been arrested including 22-year-old Christian Wingfield who was in custody for possession of a firearm but released because of the COVID-19 outbreak when they left numbers of people out of prisons to control the outbreak.So, two of the other suspects are still out there, still on the run. And police are working on a warrant for a fifth alleged shooter we have learned in this case.Davon McNeal's grandfather, John Ayala is here once again on THE STORY with me tonight. He is the founder of the D.C. chapter of the Guardian Angels, an organization that works with police to prevent a crime.Mr. Ayala, thank you so much for joining me tonight. And again, I just -- my heart breaks for you and your family and your grandson was a beautiful kid. I'm sorry for your loss. What do you think about this news that one of these men was released from prison because of COVID-19?AYALA: I am absolutely outraged. Just about a month ago, I was watching the news up in New York City. About the same thing happening and someone was released during the COVID-19 within 24 hours committed a murder. Then here in D.C. we had a young man that was 16 years old also released from COVID. Sixteen. And within 30 days after that being released, he shot nine people. And of those nine, four are deceased.This is a young man at 16 years old running around with the guns. Now in his home, you know, another young man that was brought up on gun charges released because of COVID.MACCALLUM: Yes.AYALA: And him and his friends decided to tote their weapons and get involved in the turf war. He shot my grandson. I don't know -- I mean, I don't even know they were out there, they shot my grandson and this probably could have been avoided if he was still locked out. We don't know who was the leader, was he the leader of this?MACCALLUM: Yes.AYALA: Were the other guys? We don't know. But what I do know is that he should have been in prison not on the streets.MACCALLUM: What is your message to the other individuals that were involved in the shooting which is being a premeditated first-degree murder?AYALA: I definitely -- I definitely see that because these gentlemen knew what they were doing. The sad thing is, two of these guys actually attended Crystal stop the violence cookout. Actually, he was over there. They posted pictures on their Instagram page. And then they go out right after and they kill her son. You know, you guys, the guy would be watching, you got to turn yourself in.(CROSSTALK)MACCALLUM: Why? I mean, what do you say to the people -- they have to turn themselves in if they're watching. I want to make sure that message gets out there. So, give everybody, why --(CROSSTALK)AYALA: Yes, definitely.MACCALLUM: -- what happened? What was that turf war about, why are they out there, you know, ending these young lives?AYALA: You know, I don't know what the turf war is about but these young guys in the community, what happens if there some kind of beef among them, usually it's one person that gets deceased in another community because of a shooting.They don't believe in telling the police. It's revenge. So, they come back and forth they shoot up each other's community and when they do that, they don't care who's around. They don't care if it's children, grandmothers, parents. They just want somebody from that community to lose their life.MACCALLUM: To pay the price.AYALA: So that community can be in mourning and that is the worst attitude that anybody can have.MACCALLUM: John, thank you so much, John Ayala. We'll keep on THE STORY. We'll be right back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)MACCALLUM: That's the story of Monday, July 13, 2020. But as always, the story continues so we'll see you back here tomorrow night.

It connotes quiet.\u201dOne unnamed person involved in the discussions told that \u201cyou\u2019re not going to make Joe Biden hated personally. You can\u2019t do it through personality.\u201d Instead, this source said, they have to argue that a vote for Biden \u201cis really a vote for his radical left-wing puppet masters.\u201dCan that work?The president has already road-tested this theme, telling Sean Hannity last week that \u201cwhether you like it or not, he\u2019s shot. The radical left is going to take him over.\u201dWhile Biden is a full-throated liberal who\u2019s never excited the Democratic base, he has resisted left-wing pressure to back Medicare for All and defunding the police. So the Trumpian approach would be to tar Biden with the most extreme positions of his supporters.One major difference between Biden and Hillary Clinton is that the former first lady, attacked by conservatives for decades, was viewed by many voters in 2016 as chilly, calculating and inauthentic. Even Biden\u2019s worst critics concede that he is a warm and empathetic backslapper, and that image is fixed in the public\u2019s mind after his nearly half century as a senator and vice president.If Biden is depicted as weak, some voters might grow concerned that the AOC wing of the party would be in charge. That\u2019s why Trump pounds away at law and order, riots, toppled statues, Confederate monuments, Seattle\u2019s autonomous zone--pushing the notion that the country would spin out of control without his strong hand at the White House.The flip side, of course, is that many suburban, independent and female voters have been turned off by his handling of race relations and the coronavirus crisis.What has emerged as the foundation of Biden\u2019s strategy is the art of lying low. \u201cTrump strategists have responded by all but pleading with Biden to do more and implying his muted schedule is nefarious,\u201d the Post says. The campaign has posted such Facebook ads as \u201cWhy has Biden vanished?\u201dHe hasn\u2019t exactly disappeared; on Tuesday he slammed Trump over COVID-19 and unveiled his own plan in a Wilmington speech (which was leaked in advance to the Post). But he makes such forays about once a week.Many Democrats now embrace the Biden-in-the-basement approach. They look at polls showing the Delaware Democrat with leads ranging from 8 to 14 points, ahead in most battleground states, and see little reason to change.No matter what the issue, candidate Trump gets about 90 percent of the media coverage, and Biden perhaps 1 percent. This fuels the preferred Biden narrative, that the election is a referendum on Trump, rather than about Joe\u2019s agenda or his gaffes.The press, for its part, generally salutes political success.\u201cThe result is an odd moment in presidential politics,\u201d says the Post, \u201cwhen the typical campaign physics appear to have been reversed. The candidate with better television ratings, the bigger campaign apparatus and a larger megaphone is watching his approval ratings fall while the candidate that fewer Americans hear from or see has been expanding his lead in head-to-head national polls. Less is more, for the moment at least.\u201dBut here\u2019s the rub. Another media obsession is access, or lack thereof. Trump, for all of his bitter battles with the Fourth Estate, is the most accessible president in history. Biden as a candidate, not so much.In June, according to the Post\u2019s own story, Trump granted 21 interviews with news outlets and took questions from White House reporters at least six more times. Biden allowed only five interviews, and answered zero questions on the record from the reporters who cover him.And yet there is little to no protest from journalists who generally insist that candidates have a responsibility to face the press.Biden did take about a dozen questions from reporters after his Wilmington remarks Tuesday. That enabled him to make news on the story about Russia allegedly paying bounties for the deaths of American soldiers in Afghanistan, suggesting Trump may be guilty of \u201cdereliction of duty.\u201dAs for his virtual campaign, Biden said: \u201cI started off with the premise I\u2019m going to follow the doc\u2019s orders.\u201d It makes sense for him to be cautious because of the coronavirus. \u201cI\u2019d much rather be out there with people because that\u2019s where I get the greatest feel,\u201d he said.There\u2019s nothing stopping Biden from using his basement studio to do more interviews or field questions from his press corps. You can\u2019t blame politicians for doing what\u2019s in their self-interest, in this case adopting a low-risk strategy that amounts to Biden sitting on his lead.But Tuesday was a good first step. Biden should make interviews and news conferences a regular fixture of his candidacy, if only to demonstrate that he\u2019s up to the job.", "comment": "(851)", "topic": "Media Buzz", "date": " July 1"}, {"cover": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/07/156/88/Justise-Winslow.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "title": "Grizzlies star ruled out for rest of NBA season after suffering hip injury, team announces", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/sports/grizzlies-star-out-nba-season-hip-injury", "subtitle": "Memphis Grizzlies forward Justise Winslow has been ruled out for the remainder of the NBA season after he suffered a hip injury, the team announced on Tuesday.", "keyword": "U.S.-China trade and COVID-19", "website": "Fox News", "author": "Daniel Canova", "content": " forward Justise Winslow has been ruled out for the remainder of the NBA season after he suffered a hip injury, the team announced on Tuesday.During an intra-squad scrimmage, Winslow fell down and was sidelined for the rest of the practice session. After the medical team evaluated the injury, they immediately ruled him out for the remainder of the restart. Winslow is expected to make a full recovery before next season begins. Rumors are that Dec. 1 has the potential to be the start date for the 2020-21 NBA season.Winslow, who was acquired via a trade with the Miami Heat, performed as a second option behind rookie point guard Ja Morant.

The change is for several reasons \u2014 among them, not wanting to overly tax players\u2019 bodies after they went more than four months without games, and because some teams do not have their full rosters at Walt Disney World yet because of coronavirus and other issues.Exhibitions start with a four-game slate Wednesday and continue through July 28. Each team will play three exhibitions, and the last two for each club will have the traditional 12-minute quarters.

I'm Laura Ingraham. This is \"The Ingraham Angle\" from another busy, busy Washington. Mollie Hemingway, Ben Shapiro, both will be here in moments to react to the abomination that was that Bill Barr hearing today.Also tonight, doctors vilified and censored for telling their COVID treatment stories. What's going on there? One of the doctors who organized yesterday's now infamous event is here exclusively.And Senator Josh Hawley takes apart big pharma - oh I can't wait for this - after one major drug company issued a threat after the President's executive order to lower drug prices.But first, berating Barr, befriending rioters, that's the focus of Tonight's Angle.Over the past month or so, the Angle has been telling you that there's virtually no distance between the mobs in Portland and Seattle trying to burn down federal buildings and the Democrats on Capitol Hill. And once again, they've proved our point.For several hours today, we saw the mobsters at work, but they weren't outside the building. They were inside, verbally, viciously attacking one of the most well respected legal minds in America, our Attorney General Bill Barr.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. JERROLD NADLER, D-N.Y.: Shame on you, Mr. Barr.WILLIAM BARR, ATTORNEY GENERAL: Can I just say, Mr...NADLER: Shame on you.REP. HAKEEM JEFFRIES, D-N.Y.: You have consistently undermined democracy, undermined the constitution and undermined the health, safety and well- being of the American people.REP. CEDRIC RICHMOND, D-LA.: When you all came here and brought your top staff, he brought no black people. That, sir, is systematic racism.REP. DAVID CICILLINE, D-R.I.: Your failure to respect the role of peaceful protest in this country is a disgrace. It's un-American.REP. PRAMILA JAYAPAL, D-WA.: Mr. Barr, I just asked for a yes or no. So let me just tell you - I'm starting to lose my temper - this is my time and I control it.REP. STEVE COHEN, D-TENN.: I introduced H.Res. 1032 which would require this committee to investigate your conduct as Attorney General and determine whether you should be impeached.(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM: For the record, Barr's character, his reputation, his credentials are unimpeachable. I can't say the same for those folks. Now, I certainly couldn't say the same for any of the Democrat loud mouths hurling insults at him. Now, lest you forget what's been happening in major American cities, here's a reminder.(VIDEO PLAYING)INGRAHAM: The Democrats on the Judiciary Committee today however need you to see something very different.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)NADLER: The protesters aren't mobs, they are mothers and veterans, mayors.COHEN: We've seen mothers and we've seen veterans who are peacefully protesting, not threatening the federal courthouse, beaten and gassed.CICILLINE: And the vast majority of the protesters are peaceful.REP. DEBBIE MUCARSEL-POWELL, D-FLA.: Most of the protests have been peaceful, Mr. Barr, you know that.(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM: Now we have right now in this country what appears to be a very organized effort by thousands of people across the country to create chaos and undermine our faith in the rule of law.And the Democrats, you watched them today, they just do not care. Now they're either wilfully and purposefully ignoring the dangers to our entire system or they're willing to let it all burn just to beat Donald Trump. Now, Barr who's seen a lot in his career could hardly believe what was on unfolding.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BARR: Member of this committee, regardless of your political views, should condemn violence against federal officers. I see some of these Latin American countries in Central America where the police are very, very brave because the gangs they are trying to deal with go to their houses and kill their families. You never think that could happen here, but you could never think some of the stuff we're seeing today could ever happen here.(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM: But it is happening here and it's happening because Democrat Mayors, Governors, Senators and those Congressmen have made a concerted decision to side with the very radicals who are threatening the lives of innocent Americans. They're doing it on interstate freeways, on bridges, in federal buildings, and frankly, anywhere where rioters gather.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BARR: Since when is it okay to try to burn down a federal court? If someone went down the street to the Prettyman Court here, that beautiful courthouse we have right at the bottom of the hill and started breaking windows and firing industrial grade fireworks in to start a fire, throw kerosene balloons in, and start fires in the court, is that okay? Is that okay now? No, the U.S. Marshals have a duty to stop that and defend the courthouse, and that's what we are doing in Portland.(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM: Now, make no mistake, this is no longer the Democrat Party of Bill Clinton. It's not even the party of Barack Obama. This is the party of Alexandria-Ocasio Cortez, Ilhan Omar, Ayanna Pressley, the squad. This is the party of Antifa. This is the party of radical anarchists and revolutionaries who commit any crime against any person or any piece of property in order to get their way.And what's stunning to watch is that these domestic terrorists have become in their own way an active feature of the Biden campaign, got to keep up the chaos, try to provoke a reaction from federal law enforcement, all to affect the outcome of a Presidential Election. And Judiciary Committee Democrats are taking cues from these despicable people, performing for a television audience, attempting to carry out what was the equivalent of reputational assassination of Bill Barr.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. MADELEINE DEAN, D-PA.: Have you now called for law enforcement to stop using these chemical irritants on protesters? Yes or no?BARR: Pepper spray?DEAN: Yes.BARR: No.DEAN: No?BARR: I think it's a very important non-lethal option.DEAN: For protesters?BARR: No, for rioters.DEAN: Sir, that was my question, for protesters.BARR: No, for rioters.DEAN: Yes. Sir, America was founded on the principles of free speech.BARR: When people resist law enforcement, they're not peaceful.DEAN: Reclaiming my time. I'm surprised at your lack of respect for a member of Congress.(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM: I laughed out loud in my kitchen when I saw that today. The gentle lady was treated with more deference in that exchange than she deserved. She took her five minutes to launch a personal attack on a man with an impeccable record.Like her colleague, she dissembled, distorted and demonized for purely political ends and her little charade for the cameras isn't just an example of conduct that is boorish and rude, but it's an insult to the integrity and history of the entire House of Representatives.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)POWELL: What am I supposed to say to my constituents when they ask me if the government has done everything in its power to protect their loved ones from dying?BARR: I would tell them that managing this kind of thing requires a lot of difficult choices, of weighing different consequences.(CROSSTALK)POWELL: I'm not going to lie. I am not going to lie to my constituents. I am going to tell them that President Donald Trump and the Attorney General working together are letting Americans die needlessly because of political reasons.(CROSSTALK)REP. MIKE JOHNSON, R-LA.: Is it permissible for a member of this committee to accuse a sitting Attorney General of the United States of murder, because that's what we just heard.NADLER: The members control the time.JOHNSON: Mr. Chairman, to say whatever they want? What about rules of decorum?(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM: Rules of decorum? Those went unfortunately out the window a long time ago. And after all their preening and strutting and overcharged emoting, the Democrats sought to deprive Barr his one brief moment of humanity.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BARR: I have two children who are cancer survivors, so I feel very strongly about this issue as a matter of policy, and I believe that the President has made clear that he will ensure that they--(CROSSTALK)REP. LUCY MCBATH, D-GA.: Sir, please answer my question, will you stop playing politics with Americans' health care in the middle of a pandemic?(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM: Everyone should understand where we are. As mob violence consumes the country, we're in the middle of this COVID crisis, Democrats on Capitol Hill prefer to berate the chief law enforcement official in the country and float far left conspiracy theories rather than working with him to restore order and maybe just give people a little hope.And why are Democrats doing this? Why was there not a single reason question from even one of them today? Because they know that AOC and the squad will destroy them if they deviate from the far left playbook for just a millisecond. The Democrats are more terrified of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez plus three because they're worried about her endorsing a primary challenger. They're worried more about that than what any reasonable American thinks.Ever since the impeachment effort failed, the Democrats have jumped on one crazy theory after another. Barr is a thoughtful and dedicated civil servant. He came out of retirement, not because he wanted something on his resume. He's already done everything. He did it because he has a profound sense of duty to this country. He and the American people deserve better. And don't imagine that Biden is going to stop the lawlessness in our cities, by the way,(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOE BIDEN (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I'd be using local police as we did, when we were in office. When there were riots and our federal property at stake, we were able to take care of that and were able to take care of it by the use of (inaudible) obviously the use of local police.(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM: Oh, really? Here's what Obama and Biden accomplished in Baltimore.(VIDEO PLAYING)INGRAHAM: They did nothing except let Baltimore and St. Louis, Ferguson burn, and electing Biden is going to make scenes like these play out in a neighborhood near you. And for those looking to, I don't know, for some comfort, some moderation, some sanity, Biden only offers an assurance to the far left and the AOC wing of his party.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BIDEN: If I'm elected and this passes, I'm going to be good to go down as the most progressive President in the American history.(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM: Not bad. You're also going to be good to go down as one of the most manipulated and passive Presidents in American history. My goodness, think of Bill Barr and what he had to endure today and then think of Biden running the show, oh, sorry, whoever his Vice-President and the old Obama alums running the show. God help us, and that's the angle.Alright, joining me now is Ben Shapiro, Editor in Chief of The Daily Wire and author of \"How to Destroy America,\" we're seeing that play out. Also with me Mollie Hemingway, Senior Editor at The Federalist, Fox News contributor.Ben, as loathsome as these characters on the left were at today's hearing, and also it really just showed us how intellectually morally bankrupt Democrats in Congress are right now. There is no decency. There's no dignity despite Biden invoking that word several times during his event today.BEN SHAPIRO, AUTHOR, HOW TO DESTROY AMERICA: It was a moral absurdity. The Democrats resembled nothing so much as a bunch of corgis attempting to strip a basketball while going after William Barr. It was just ridiculous from beginning to end.And the fact that Barr, who is a public servant, who has been around since the Reagan administration was treated this way, it's a good reminder that when President Trump says, \"They're not coming after me, they're coming after you\" to his supporters, he's right about that because Barr is generic arc (ph). He is not Donald Trump.He is just a normal run of the mill, very intelligent Republican conservative. And they went after him as though he were Donald Trump, which means they'll come after virtually anybody so long as that person opposes the radical left's agenda.INGRAHAM: Mollie, I think Ben's point is something that we have to state over and over again. So people take this away from Trump's tweets or his personality or he rubs you the wrong way sometimes. This is about the American people and how they tried to push around a man who is twice Attorney General of the United States.That's what they're going to do to the average - imagine what they'll do to the average citizen if they have the Justice Department back and all these federal agencies with investigatory power, imagine what they'll do.MOLLIE HEMINGWAY, SENIOR EDITOR, THE FEDERALIST: Imagine what they'll do and also it's what they were unable to do with Barr because this is a man in full possession of his faculties. He's had a full professional career. He brings a lot of experience and wisdom and gravitas. He is a statesman.He is actually able to handle what Democrats are throwing at him. But if they are to turn their - that same sort of hate and viciousness against a typical Republican, I think a lot of people understand that's what they want to do and it's what they will do if they have more power.In many ways, what we saw today was probably the best example of the choice facing American voters. There is a group of Democrats, a large group of Democrats who are unwilling to condemn violence against federal buildings and federal law enforcement officers, destruction of city centers, arson, looting, assault.They're unable to condemn those things. In fact they defend those things and they instead attack the people who are attempting to restore law and order to these places. That is a very visceral choice facing American voters and that was on full display today.INGRAHAM: And this was Ben, I guess Nancy Pelosi came out today, and she had this as usual trenchant analysis of the Barr hearing today.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. NANCY PELOSI, D-CALIF.: It demonstrated to the American people the contempt that he has for our democracy. He should be answering for what he did at Lafayette Square, a disgrace. So this is really, he was like a blob. He was like a just henchman for The President of the United States.(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM: Henchman? Ben, she has now morphed into Ilhan Omar. I mean is there really any difference between Nancy Pelosi and any member of the squad, or frankly any member of Antifa? Really? I can't believe I'm saying this, but they're all one and the same.SHAPIRO: Yes. She was assimilated into the Borg last year when she refused to actually pass that resolution specifically condemning Ilhan Omar and then did a photo shoot with Ilhan Omar on the cover of Rolling Stone by the way. The innate ridiculousness of Nancy Pelosi claiming that Bill Barr is a threat to democracy, while simultaneously the entirety - virtually the entirety of the Democratic Party is claiming that federal law enforcement officers enforcing the law is military tyranny.It's ridiculous on its face and it's disgusting because again, they're saving their most rabid language for federal law enforcement officers. We've heard sitting Congress people on the Democratic side suggest that these people who are serving us and protecting us and standing between the villains and civilization, we've heard them called the Gestapo. We have heard them called tyrants. We we've heard the suggestion that they are in fact the threat in these cities.If that's the line they're going to pursue, I think sooner or later Americans are going to fight back against this, obviously non-violently. They're going to go to the ballot box and they're going to reflect the idea that most Americans are not willing to go along with their cities burning just to make Democrats feel good about themselves.INGRAHAM: Yes. That's why we are going to get to this later. That's why there's so much censorship from big tech. They don't want people to see the images that we're showing tonight on The Ingraham Angle. And Mollie, what got very little coverage of course is what Barr said, forcefully pushing back against claims that he's under pressure from The President in prosecutions or other criminal investigations. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BARR: The President has not attempted to interfere in these decisions. On the contrary, he has told me from the start that he expects me to exercise my independent judgment to make whatever call I think is right and that is precisely what I've done.(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM: Mollie, do remember anyone on the left charging Holder - Eric Holder with running interference even after he said - he actually said he was Obama's wingman. They weren't worried about that one bit.HEMINGWAY: They weren't at all. The reason why people don't like Attorney General William Barr is because he is attempting to hold people accountable for one of the most lawless things that has been done in the history of the country, if not the most - one of the most horrible things, which was this Russia collusion hoax, an attempt to take down the elected President of the country, to harm international relations, and to use it, to use all the tools of the intelligence services to do this.That was a horrible thing and Barr has said it clearly, and that's why they don't like him. But what's so galling about today is if you saw any pressure, it's not coming from people who are asking, it's not enough pressure coming from people who are asking for accountability. And it's all coming from people who are demanding that he stop, that he allow that lawlessness to continue, and that they be allowed to get away with what they did. And that is where the pressure is coming from.INGRAHAM: Yes, Ben and Mollie, they burned the Pfizer process, they burned the rule of law, they burned impeachment, all these investigations and now they will allow cities to burn, all to get rid of Trump. That has got to wake up the American voters. I certainly hope so.Both of you, your analysis tonight, so important. Thank you very much. And I had a tale of two liberal cities. Again, consumed by mayhem and their own leaders who seem completely unable or more accurately unwilling to stop the burning. In Seattle, an investigative journalist takes us inside how the city is going further than any other in bringing about the collapse of law and order. And in Chicago, we speak exclusively to the man who'll take on corrupt Cook County DA. You remember her; Kim Foxx. Stay there.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)INGRAHAM: Liberal cities across the country are being terrorized by chaos and lawlessness, especially in the Pacific Northwest. Now last night, we told you about the violence in Portland, a city that has looked like a scene out of Mad Max for the past two months. But tonight, we look at Seattle, the CHOP Autonomous Zone may be gone, but the radicals controlling the city are looking to continue its legacy.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)ANGELICA CHAZARO, PROFESSOR, UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON: In order to actually transform the way the city does public safety, we need to shrink the current police force.KSHAMA SAWANT, COUNCILWOMAN, SEATTLE: We are coming to dismantle this deeply oppressive, racist, sexist, violent, utterly bankrupt system of capitalism, this police state.MAYOR JENNY DURKAN, D-SEATTLE: It looks like this President is doing a dress rehearsal for martial law, sending in federal forces to take over police duties in city after city for political purposes.(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM: Now, my next guest says Seattle is going further than any other American city right now and deconstructing the entire justice system. The rule of law, it's shot there. Joining me now is Christopher Rufo, City Journal Contributing Editor.Now, Christopher, tell us what your sources and I know they're good, in the Seattle Police Department are confiding about what's really happening, the truth of what's happening in that city?CHRISTOPHER RUFO, CONTRIBUTING EDITOR, CITY JOURNAL: So right now, within the entire justice system in the city of Seattle, people are at a full blown panic. The Seattle City Council is currently deliberating a legislation to reduce the police force by 50%, which would have one of the lowest officers per capita of any large city if that happens.At the same time, the King County Executive Dow Constantine has pledged to close the Downtown jail and reduce the overall County jail capacity by 60% to 65%. It is just thing after thing after thing that the activists are pushing forward as we struggle with the COVID pandemic, as we struggle with this civil unrest. They're not waiting at all and their goal is very simple, abolish the police, abolish prisons and abolish the courts.INGRAHAM: So, again, the goal is clear. If that's what they want to do, the ends are going to mean complete destruction of life as we know it or knew it, I should say in Seattle. And Christopher, you got your hands on documents from King County's, it's called Zero Youth Detention Program, and they offer a template for Seattle's radical plan to abolish the prisons you just referenced. And that the document is full of ideas from critical race theory, including this page that describes white culture as \"individualism, meritocracy, progress and objectivity.\" Chris, doesn't it sound like it was written by a white supremacist there? Unbelievable.RUFO: Yes, there is a really increasingly fine line between old style racism and new style critical race theory. And what's happened is this, progressives have realized that the economic divide, classical Marxism is not a winning message. It has never worked anywhere it has been tried in the last century. So they've really grasped onto something that is unfortunately working much better for their aims, it's dividing people along racial lines and using the rhetoric of race to achieve the economic outcomes of Marxism.And Seattle is really ground zero and it's really astonishing, if you look at these documents, they're basically making the argument that the entire justice system is an institution of white supremacy, an institution of white domination, and the corrupt and evil racist culture, and the only solution for them, and this is at the highest levels of government, is to burn it all down. And that's what we're seeing not only in the streets, but we're seeing that in the boardrooms, in the decision-making centers, at the highest levels of government. It's really astonishing. And we haven't seen anything like this in recent history.INGRAHAM: Yes. I can tell you, Christopher, flyover country, those Midwestern states, swing states across this country - they better see that the coasts are collapsing in on them. If they think it's going to stay in Seattle, they haven't been paying attention. It's going to get worse under Biden because they're going to know what they're doing is working. Christopher, stay on this for us please and thank you for bringing us this story.Now, we traveled 2000 miles east of Seattle to Chicago, where Mayor Lori Lightfoot's exceedingly bad leadership is exacerbating the horrific crime wave there now sweeping the city in the wake of George Floyd's death. But the failure isn't Lightfoot's alone; it also rests with Cook County State Attorney Kim Foxx. Now, that's right; that's a woman who refused to hold Jussie Smollett accountable for his hate crime hoax.She is now letting peaceful protesters who destroy and loot businesses off the hook. Why is she doing this? What's really her goal? Critics say she's refusing to uphold the rule of law because she wants a future in this new far left Democrat politics. Now, one of those critics and my next guest, Judge Pat O'Brien wants to derail her dangerous political ambitions. He joins me now and he's challenging her, Kim Foxx, for State's Attorney. Judge O'Brien, why is it so important in your mind that she be defeated in the next election?PATRICK O'BRIEN, R-STATE ATTORNEY CANDIDATE, COOK COUNTY: Laura, good evening and thank you. It's important because at this point, we're at a tipping stage where her policies are both corrupted and ineffective, and it seems like she's encouraging what we see on the streets, which is the blood of the innocent children that's running down and essentially the gangs and drugs controlling neighbourhoods; neighborhoods that she says she's protecting. So, the only thing we can do is to say \"Enough is enough, fire Kim Foxx\".INGRAHAM: Now, this is what Chicago police union president said on this show just a week ago.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOHN CATANZARA, PRESIDENT, CHICAGO FRATERNAL ORDER OF POLICE: There is a lot of people that were arrested with those guns that were immediately let back out on the street again. And it goes right back to Kim Foxx and the broken county jail system.I'm appealing directly to every voter in Cook County, Illinois, right now. You have a chance this November to take Kim Foxx out of office and do something worthwhile. She needs to go if we are going to get the city back away from the iceberg that the mayor has said it on a course with.(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM: Judge O'Brien what's your message to the voters of Chicago this fall, especially those who are worried about the rule of law, race relations, all of it?O'BRIEN: Well, it's this, that you can't have turnstile justice, that you can't tell people that they can violate the law with impunity. They've got to be told that there are consequences for what, in fact, they do. There was no way that the neighborhoods are going to be safe, that victims are going to be protected if you turn your back on the law. The fact that she's running for an office that she doesn't have right now, which is to be on national stage, is just a crime, and the crime is Kim Foxx.INGRAHAM: Judge O'Brien, thank you so much, good to see you tonight.And up ahead, why is big pharma taking on Trump? Senator Josh Hawley takes them all on, and you don't want to miss it.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)INGRAHAM: Last week President Trump signed four very aggressive executive orders to slash drug prices, and as expected, big pharma, they are fighting back. Here is what the CEO of Pfizer said on an earnings call today.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm disappointed by these executive orders. They pose enormous destruction at a time where the industry needs to be completely focused on developing a potential COVID-19 vaccine or treatment. We have plans to invest in both, R&D and manufacturing in the United States. If finalized, these new executive orders would force us to rescind those plans.(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM: Well, Pfizer, of course, everyone knows is an amazing American company, but his grousing about profits is absurd. Last week HHS and the Pentagon announced that it would pay Pfizer and its German biotech partner $1.95 billion to produce 100 million doses of a COVID-19 vaccine with the option of buying an additional 500 million doses, so you do the math they are. So there is no reason U.S. citizens should be paying more than other OECD countries for other drugs that Pfizer makes. That's the whole point of this executive order. The upcharge is absurd.Here to respond is Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri. Senator, you just heard the CEO of Pfizer essentially threatening to move manufacturing overseas because of these executive orders. What does this tell you?SEN. JOSH HAWLEY, R-MO.: It tells you that they are very interested in their profits and the gravy train that they've had going for years. Listen, I have no sympathy for big pharma whatsoever. They routinely charge Americans two and three and four times more for the same drugs that they charge patients in, say, Europe, France. And I know this is true because we have studies them. My home state of Missouri, they are charging people of Missouri three and four and five times more than they're charging folks in France or Germany and Canada. And I'm glad that the president is standing up to them.INGRAHAM: And I think, again, the money that is given by the drug companies to both political parties, it's astronomical. They are among the biggest donors to politics in the United States. And that's fine. That's what they do. But let's not all think this is all just charitable endeavors. It's a business, it's a company, but they have gotten a free ride.And I wanted to ask you, senator, about the president's decision, the administration's decision to give Kodak a boost in order to keep some medical manufacturing in the United States. There are a lot of conservatives out there, free marketeers, who would say we are playing favorites. And to that you say?HAWLEY: Well, I say, listen, it is important we manufacture as many pharmaceutical products as we can in this country. The fact that we manufacture so few drugs any longer, particularly drugs like insulin, we manufactured zero percent in this country. Major pharmaceutical products we've found because of the COVID-19 crisis that we are deeply dependent on foreign supply chains. So I think it is incumbent to look at all the options for bringing those supply chains back, for getting medical production back in this country.And to go back to big pharma, again, I don't have any sympathies for these guys. This big pharma, big government alliance has been great for big pharma. They have made a killing these last few years, really for decades. And it's time they start putting patients first.INGRAHAM: And Senator, a couple of weeks back, speaking of Biden, he said we should re-examine Trump's tariffs on China. Of course, that's the whole reason China came to the bargaining table in these trade deals. But today, Biden came out and pretended that he was going to be the one after four decades plus in Washington to put America first. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOE BIDEN, D-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Using federal dollars that have already been appropriated, to focus them on building things that make us and increase our independence, so we don't have to rely on anyone else for, whether it's cyber security, cyber information. We have the capacity to do it at home. Do them at home.(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM: OK, Senator, is it my mistake or not, am I remembering this incorrectly -- wasn't he vice president in an administration for eight years? I must have missed all that work on these issues of bringing manufacturing back to the United States.HAWLEY: The problem with Joe Biden is that he is a classic China appeaser, and he has been his whole political career. He certainly was as vice president. Heck, even earlier this year he was questioning whether China was really a geostrategic threat. That turned out to be a little bit of a problem for him as we have seen with COVID-19, which is why he doesn't want to talk about those past statements now.But this is a guy who has never stood up to China. In fact, he has been all too eager to roll out the red carpet for China, give them whatever they want, sell out our jobs, sell out our workers. That's the problem. We're still cleaning up from his mess of years ago.And why would we go back to those failed policies? We don't need more appeasement. We need to get tough on China. This president started to do it. We need even more of that.INGRAHAM: Senator, I wouldn't let you get away without like you said this past weekend where you said, quite candidly, that you wouldn't support a Supreme Court nominee unless he or she had publicly stated before the nomination that Roe versus Wade was wrongly decided. Now, is that a litmus test that even some Republicans will back away from? What is your response?HAWLEY: You can call it whatever you want, Laura. I call it asking some basic questions about judicial philosophy. And I also call it the end of the trust us approach. For years conservatives, especially religious conservatives, let's be honest, have been told by the D.C. establishment just trust us. We'll pick good judges, just trust us. Don't ask too many questions, certainly don't ask about Roe. Just trust us.I'm through with that. I want to know, because Roe is absolutely central, Roe is an unbridled act of judicial imperialism. And if a nominee thinks that Roe was rightly decided, then he or she is a judicial imperialist and I'm not going to vote for him.INGRAHAM: We've still go to get Collins and Murkowski to sign on to any potential Supreme Court pick, but I would agree with you that if look at Roberts' record and even Gorsuch on some issues, and you wonder what the heck happened there. Trust but verify, I guess that's what you have to do. Senator, great to see you as always on these important issues. Thanks so much.And Twitter and Facebook are censoring anyone now who dares tout potential benefits of hydroxychloroquine. Now, my question is, does big tech have an M.D. after their vaunted brand names? And are they costing lives? Two doctors who have actually treated COVID patients with hydroxy including the one who organized yesterday's now viral press conference, they're here to respond. You don't want to miss this.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I have personally treated over 350 patients with COVID. And the result has been the same. I put them on hydroxychloroquine, I put them zinc, I put them on ZithroMax, and they are all well. I've not lost one patient.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: If it seems like there is an orchestrated attack that's going on against hydroxychloroquine, it's because there is. When have you ever heard of a medication generating this degree of controversy?(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM: But the M.D.'s at Twitter and Facebook have deemed those comments, heretical, dangerous. Twitter said the video violates its policies on spreading misleading and potentially harmful information related to COVID-19, misinformation? Here's what one of the world's top epidemiologist told this show about hydroxychloroquine just last week.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)INGRAHAM: You think thousands of lives could be saved going forward if they released that hydroxychloroquine stockpile and even gave it as a prophylactic for frontline workers, if they wanted it?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I think 75,000 to 100,000 lives will be saved if that happens.(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM: Joining me now is Dr. Ramin Oskouithe cardiologist, CEO of Foxhall Cardiology in D.C. Also with me, Dr. Simone Gold, emergency medicine specialist. Dr. Gold, let's start with you. You organized this now viral event yesterday. What's your reaction to the anti-hydroxychloroquine censorship by big tech?DR. SIMONE GOLD, EMERGENCY MEDICINE SPECIALIST: We come with a message of hope for the American people. The American people have been told that this is just something they need to have a lot of fear and a lot of panic over. And it's simply not true. There's a cure, there's treatment for early COVID disease, and that is hydroxychloroquine and zinc. It's very straightforward. It's easy. When you look at data from other countries, it's easy. We just don't have that kind of access here.And if anybody has any doubt that this is the answer, all they have to do is notice that YouTube, Twitter, and Facebook deleted all information about this. When did do a press conference, but we also had six hours of education from physicians explaining exactly why the drug works and going over all the safety and efficacy. They even took down our website. It's incredible. So somebody is really afraid of getting the truth.But I'm here to tell the American people hydroxychloroquine and zinc, we're going to get the information back up soon, America's frontline doctors.INGRAHAM: Dr. Oskoui, here is the latest hydroxychloroquine hating from Dr. Fauci himself. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS, ABC NEWS: The president promoting the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine. We know the FDA has recommended against emergency use.DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES: Exactly. And I go along with the FDA. The overwhelmingly, prevailing clinical trials that have looked at the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine have indicated that it is not effective in coronavirus disease.(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM: Dr. Oskoui, what are the issues with the studies? There's one from Brazil that seem to be coloring Fauci and others' thinking on hydroxy, also the Boulware study. What is he talking about?DR. RAMIN OSKOUI, CARDIOLOGIST: What he is talking about is probably the most recent study out of Brazil that was referenced that came out last year in the New England Journal of Medicine. What it showed was when hydroxychloroquine given late, they couldn't tell whether it worked or not. And that's the study authors' own words. The reality is when given early in mild to moderate disease, hydroxychloroquine works terrifically well, and as we've seen, cuts mortality rate by 50 percent.INGRAHAM: But when we see the comments from mainstream media sources, Dr. Gold, I'm not going to say the word \"cure.\" I'm not a doctor, but I am going to say the passionate fight against a drug that's been around for 60 years is stunning. And the vitriol with which the critics launch their attacks, I've never seen anything like it. I don't know if Trump had never talked about it, if they'd feel differently, or if it's big pharma, or a combination, I don't know. But Dr. Gold, your group became persona non grata really quickly, really quickly.GOLD: You know what, Laura, I am a board certified practicing emergency physician. That's fine. We can take it. All of us can take it. But what we need to do, is we requested the FDA look at the emergency use authorization that's on their desk. We'd really like them just to allow us to use hydroxychloroquine, as we always were able to prior to COVID, and especially let us use it on-label now for COVID so that the states can stop restricting our usage of it. We really just want to heal patients and heal America.INGRAHAM: Dr. Oskoui, a former Planned Parenthood president actually chimed in on hydroxy. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DR. LEANA WEN, FORMER PRESIDENT AND PLANNED PARENTHOOD: I really worry, Wolf, because there are so many millions of Americans for whom the president is their most trusted messenger. And when he starts saying things that go against science that are actually dangerous, I worry that Americans are going to go out, as they have before, and take this unproven medication.(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM: When I think of protecting lives, Dr. Oskoui, I think of Planned Parenthood. What's really frightening this woman?OSKOUI: I think what's frightening this woman is that there are numerous clinical trials that show that hydroxychloroquine works. And I think what she is afraid of is that this gets discovered by the American people. We never talk about the European data. We never talk about the mortality rates in countries that went to hydroxychloroquine early and aggressively. And that's something that should scare all of these people. Dr. Fauci is simply lying.INGRAHAM: Put that chart up. We actually have a chart. Put that chart up. We only have a few seconds. I wanted people to see that chart, where you see the countries on the right, early HCQ use, that's hydroxy use, very low rates of mortality and hospitalizations. Doctors, thank you very much.Up next, the Last Bite. It's a good one. Stay there.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)INGRAHAM: OK, if you want proof that Stacey Abrams is no longer a top V.P. contender, listen to this one.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)STACEY ABRAMS, FORMER GEORGIA GUBERNATORIAL CANDIDATE: We can't romanticize and say that if we do this, the world changes. It doesn't. There are no saviors running for reelection. There are no saviors running to save our country.Well, I want us to remember that this election is not about being excited about any single person. It's about being energized about our power to shape our future.(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM: Biden better hope his voters have more enthusiasm for his run than she has.

All right, we are moments away from a very busy hour of breaking news, President Trump set to hold a news conference at the White House. We'll have that for you live. But first, tensions high over on Capitol Hill today, Attorney General Bill Barr clashing with House Democrats repeatedly over the response to violent protests in some of America's cities. Democrats saying Barr and the Trump administration are playing politics by sending federal agents to stop the unrest in places like Portland. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The president wants footage for his campaign ads, and you appear to be serving it up to him as ordered. In most of these cities, the protests have begun to wind down before you marched in and confronted the protesters. And the protesters aren't mobs. They are mothers and veterans and mayors. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We fought for a democracy for the right to speak freely, and you are attempting to take that away. What's worse, you're doing it for the sole purpose of furthering the president's political agenda and generating footage for Trump campaign commercials. (END VIDEO CLIP) WATTERS: And Barr firing back, arguing it's his responsibility to protect federal property. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: -- a federal court. Is that ok? Is that OK now? No, the U.S. marshals have a duty to stop that and defend the courthouse. And that's what we are doing in Portland. We are at the courthouse defending the courthouse. We're not out looking for trouble. (END VIDEO CLIP) WATTERS: And, of course, partisan politics were on full display. There were plenty of moments where Democrats just kept talking over the Attorney General. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I gave instructions as to what -- (CROSSTALK) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Reclaiming my time. (CROSSTALK) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You've got to let him answer. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Reclaiming my time. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The effort there was -- (CROSSTALK) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Mr. Barr, let me tell you -- I'm starting to lose my temper. (CROSSTALK) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We are not taking down public health orders, we were making narrow -- (CROSSTALK) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Reclaiming my time. Will you restore my time, because this witness is taking my time? (END VIDEO CLIP) WATTERS: OK. We have Dana back here. And let's go to Greg Gutfeld. Greg, what did you think about today's hearing? GREG GUTFELD, FOX NEWS HOST: Well, first of all, after that -- that was the worst thing I have ever seen on TV, and I include Morning Joe. After that fiasco, we have to reclaim our time for America. Have you ever heard of a more infantile loser defense in the hearing that you can ask a question then cut the answer off with I'm reclaiming my time? It creates a one-way street, in which you could actually accuse somebody of murder. You could accuse them of treason and then you deny them the opportunity to defend themselves. Meanwhile, this is a party of compassion? I saw nothing but fascists. These guys are -- no wonder they think the mob -- the mob in Portland and Seattle is not a bad thing. The mob is just their street team. And by the way, they keep using this whole -- this idiotic excuse. You know, the majority of protesters are peaceful. Bad tings do not become exempt in small amounts. The majority of Americans aren't serial killers, but you don't need a majority of serial killers to create a crime wave. So let's just lose this bait and switch when we send the police in to deal with violent criminals. We're not going after the peaceful. It's stupid. This was a contest between who can ask the dumbest question. And for their premise to hold, they had to deny the reality of violence, that 60 days of violence. Three police officers permanently blinded, and Bill Barr has to sit there like a calm gorilla swatting these stupid flies off his nose calmly because they're so stupid. And I've got to ask. How could anybody in America put up with this? If I was sitting where Barr was, I don't know what I would do. They would have to pump me full of xanax because -- or either that or they would have to put me in a cage like Silence of the Lambs. Have something stuffed in my mouth and hung upside down because I would lose my mind. I honestly -- I have never seen anything more disgusting on TV. I thought the Kavanaugh hearing was an injustice. This is pretty damn close. WATTERS: All right. We're going to cost (ph) Greg Gutfeld off the Attorney General list because he would never be able to cut it. Dana, why don't you take the reins from here? DANA PERINO, FOX NEWS HOST: Yeah. Sorry about that. I will give you back your time since I was frozen there. Katie, one thing that I noticed is the Democrats have been asking Bill Barr to come and testify for months. And they finally get this date and he gets there. Unfortunately, Chairman Nadler was in a car accident this morning. The hearing started 45 minutes late, understandable. But even -- not only to Greg's point did they not let him answer. They didn't even allow him to have a break to get a bite to eat. Like, he was so calm during all of that. KATIE PAVLICH, FOX NEWS HOST: What happened today was really a disgrace, Dana. And the spokesperson for DOJ tweeted after it finally was over, Kerri Kupec, and said I'm reclaiming this day. And I think anybody watching felt the same exact way. The Democrats made a clear choice today. They not only didn't condemn the violence but they defended it. There was no condemnation of anything that was going on. When Bill Barr was asked do you think that the courthouse, the federal courthouse in Portland would be standing today if federal law enforcement agents weren't brought in for back-up to defend the property and the agents inside? And he said I don't think it would be still standing. He was also asked if maybe the mob wants to come up to the Capitol building and decide that they're going take that over -- attack that with fireworks, do you believe the Democrats and the body would be willing to defend the Capitol. And Bill Barr said, you know, with this body, I'm not exactly sure. And their behavior in continuation of cutting him off and not allowing him to answer any of the questions about very serious issues showed that this is just an extension of the impeachment trial in terms of their behavior. And they can't move forward. And while they accuse Bill Barr of being political, they were all very political today in trying to put the administration on trial again. And, you know, attacking every single aspect of what they're doing without allowing him to explain anything. And he is much smarter. Greg is right. This was so -- it was really difficult to watch. PERINO: All right. And a hearing like, this when you have an election year and you have tensions rising high, you can almost bet, Jesse that you could see a direct line from the hearing questions today, probably from both sides to their fundraising appeals back home to their campaign donors. But I don't think Biden is on the same page as the rest of these folks. The former vice president took questions today. And we're going to talk about that in the B block, but he took questions today. And he was asked about the violence and the protests and what should happen to those who are violent. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I think we do need to hold those who violate the law accountable. You should never let what's done in a march for equal rights overcome what the reason for the march is. And that's what these folks are doing. And they should be arrested -- found, arrested, and tried. (END VIDEO CLIP) PERINO: All right, Jesse, your thoughts. WATTERS: Well, that was too little too late. And I think everybody fell asleep during that answer, because it wasn't forceful enough and he just slid that in there and then just condemned Donald Trump for the rest of it. All you need to say if you're a Democrat is can we not light fires to federal buildings? It's really not that hard to do. But for some reason, the Democrats just can't bring themselves to do that. It's like if Donald Trump is against people setting fires to a federal courthouse, they all of a sudden have to be for it. I just think it is terrible politics. This was not a hearing. This was a cancellation. They just wanted to cancel Bill Barr. They were not interested in hearing or listening to anything he had to say, and then because they know he's armed with facts. He's calm, cool, and collected, and they're just angry. They're furious. They look unserious. They look unprofessional. And they're just screaming at him. And it's kind of bad energy tied up from him turning the tables with the Russia hoax. And him defending Donald Trump, because Donald Trump, love him or hate him, he's still acting within the boundaries of executive power. And he is not the wing man of the president, as Eric Holder said he was with Barack Obama. He's upholding the rule of law. And really, that's the problem with the Democrats. They do not want the rule of law upheld. If it was up to them, and you can just see by their actions, they would be OK with Antifa burning down courthouses. They're OK with violent protesters attacking police, because they won't condemn it. Because when you show the video at the top, as Jim Jordan did, of all the violence taking place in Portland against a federal property, they didn't even want to discuss that. It was like the first time they had ever seen it. And it's sad. And I think if you're watching this and you are a Democrat or you're Antifa, you felt like you have been given license to riot because they're not policing their own. They don't like police, and the irony of Jerry Nadler denying someone else lunch -- not cool, not cool, Jerry. PERINO: All right. Juan, let's get your take on how do you think today's hearing went. JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS HOST: Again, I thought that it was pretty boring, because again, I thought that what was said, you know, kind of foreseen. Everybody knew positions beforehand. I don't think there is much arguing, Dana, that the Justice Department under Bill Barr is extremely, extremely politicized. It was in February that 1,000 former Justice Department officials called on him to resign over his handling of the Roger Stone case. And then in May, 2,000 former Justice Department officials called on him to resign over his handling of the Michael Flynn case, right? So what you get Barr is doing everything that Jeff Sessions -- nobody's liberal, nobody's protester (ph) Jeff Sessions would not do. And here I'm talking about things like getting rid of the U.S. attorney in Manhattan who is looking into Rudy Giuliani, Trump's confidant. I'm talking about assigning somebody, John Durham, to look into the origins of the Trump probe under Barack Obama, as if there is some crime there. I mean, I think that what Bill Barr has done -- and I think that's what you are seeing today is people saying, you know, Mr. Barr, you have undermined public trust and equal-handed application of the law in this country. And we are a country of laws, and this is damaging. And I think that's the big message. PERINO: All right. So lots of different people can watch a hearing and have different takeaways from it. We'll keep talking about this. The president has a press conference coming up. We'll take that to you live as soon as it starts. But meantime, Joe Biden, he's going to make a big announcement about his vice presidential pick. We're going to tell you about it next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) WILLIAMS: President Trump coming out soon for a news conference at the White House. Meanwhile, Joe Biden making a lot of news today, the former VP saying he will announce his running-mate next week, Mr. Biden also unveiling the fourth pillar of his economic plan. It focused on social justice and racial economic inequality. He also said this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BIDEN: I think I have laid out the most detailed plans on the economy and on issues relating to healthcare and the rest of any president in modern history. I mean, it's awfully detailed. If I'm elected and this passes, I'm going to be good to go down as one of the most progressive presidents in American history. (END VIDEO CLIP) WILLIAMS: Dana, I wonder what you think of that, because Bernie Sanders says much the same. That Biden would be one of the most progressive presidents in American history, although some Sanders supporters say they don't think Biden is liberal enough. PERINO: I have a lot of thoughts. I don't know how many we can get out in the time that we have -- wow. So, you know you think very election is about the future, if that's what we're supposed to believe, right? So hope and change for Obama. That worked out very well for him. Joe Biden, after all this time in Washington, saying that now he's going to be the agent for change, but delivering it in a way is so -- I guess weak and it seems feeble. And so there is that for the broader audience. And then for the progressives, one of the things that happened today is a former co-chair of the Sanders campaign said that having to vote for Biden is like having to eat a bowl of S-word. (CROSSTALK) GUTFELD: Say it, Dana. Say it. PERINO: I'm trying to be the plus. And I'm not going to curse on air. She said it. And I'm quoting her. And I think one of the things you see is that Joe Biden is constantly having to try to shore up that progressive base for -- to say things like he would be the most progressive president ever. But I thought you just won a primary because you won't -- I mean, you can forgive us for being a little confused. WILLIAMS: All right. So Jesse, the other part of the big news was his announcement that he's going to name his vice presidential pick next week. There was some kerfuffle in Washington today because Chris Dodd seemed to be dismissing a little bit Kamala Harris, the Senator from California, much talk about Karen Bass, the Congresswoman from California, and Susan Rice, and of course, Elizabeth Warren in the mix. What do you make of all this? WATTERS: I've just never seen this little interest in a vice presidential pick. No one cares. No one is talking about it. It's generated this much buzz. And the buzz only exists in the beltway. I think he set the wrong expectations when months and months ago he said he was definitely going to pick a woman. So that kind of takes the surprise factor out of it. And then he's kind of hinted that he's going to pick a woman of color. So then that really shrinks the size of the available people to pick. And right now, there is just not a lot of people that are generating nationally the excitement or the interest as who -- who Joe Biden's VP is going to be. It's the not the Michelle Obama, you know, that name's not out there. It's not -- you know, Elon Musk. It's not an outsider or something like that. It's really your just kind of cookie-cutter, you know. Draw it up in the lab. This is what's going to get me this percentage of this demographic. It's boring, to be honest with you. WILLIAMS: Jesse, I have to interrupt you, because the president is coming out for his briefing. DONALD TRUMP, UNITED STATES PRESIDENT: -- has taken a momentous step forward achieving American pharmaceutical independence, very, very big, big step. A focus of our campaign to bring America's critical supply chains and medical manufacturing back to the USA, we have been working on this for a long time. This is a core of our strategy to protect our people from the horrible China virus, should have never happened, should have never been here. They should have stopped it. In the decades before I took office, foreign nations were allowed to freely plunder our factories and loot our industries. Take our business out of the United States. Millions of jobs were vacuumed out, taken out so easily. Our politicians let that happen. And our communities were stripped and shipped, in many cases, to China and all over the world -- countries all over the world. Nearly four years ago, we launched a bold effort to revitalize American manufacturing. Enact fair trade deals and bring our industries back home where they belonged. When the China virus landed on our shores, it became clearer than ever before that restoring American manufacturing is a core matter of national security. We must never be reliant on a foreign nation for American's medical or other needs, and that includes many other needs. I just want to say that Pfizer just announced a little while go that they're combing phase two and phase three trials. And the vaccine looks like it's really heading in a very rapid direction, a very positive direction, first time that's happened. And they're many months ahead of any other trial. There has never been anything like it. So it's the fastest ever. And to me, it's very exciting. Today, I'm proud to announce one of the most important deals in the history of U.S. pharmaceutical industries. My administration has reached a historic agreement with a great American company. You remember this company. It's called, from the good old camera age, the old days, to begin producing critical pharmaceutical ingredients. It's called Kodak. And it's going to be right here in America. So I want to congratulate the people in Kodak. They have been working very hard. Members of my administration are present in Rochester right now -- Rochester, New York, good place. And they are trying to finalize this groundbreaking deal, and they will be announcing this deal. I want to thank Governor Andrew Cuomo and his representatives. We've worked really well together on this deal. It's a big deal. It's a great deal for New York and a great deal for Kodak. Ninety percent of all prescriptions written in the United States are for generic drugs. We have approved more generic drugs than any other administration by far. Generic drugs can be just as good as the brand names but cost much less. Less than 10 percent in the active pharmaceutical ingredients needed to make these drugs, they're currently manufactured in America. More than 50 percent, however, are made in India and China. And you will be seeing a lot of things have happened -- it's been happening, but it's happening at a more rapid pace right now. With this new agreement, my administration is using the Defense Production Act to provide a $765 million loan to support the launch of Kodak Pharmaceuticals. It's a great name when you think of it, such I great name. It was one of the great brands in the world. And then people went digital and Kodak didn't follow. But now under very extraordinary leadership, they are following. And they are doing something that's in a different, and it's in a field that they've really hired some of the best people in the world to be taking care of that company and watching that company, watching over it. But it's a breakthrough in bringing pharmaceutical manufacturing back to the United States. Under this contract, our 33rd use of the Defense Production Act, remember when you were saying I didn't use it enough. I didn't use it enough. And now you heard. It's the 33rd use. We don't talk about it all the time. We used it. And we used it as a little bit of a threat, frankly, with certain companies that weren't doing it as we were asking them to do. And it came through as both a threat and a usage. But this is our 33rd use of the Defense Production Act. Kodak will now produce generic, active pharmaceutical ingredients. This is a big deal. Using advanced manufacturing techniques, Kodak will also make the key starting materials that are the building blocks for many drugs in a manner that is both cost competitive and environmentally safe, will be competitive with almost all countries and soon with all countries. Once this new division is fully operational, in addition to all of the other plants that we have opened with other companies throughout the United States recently, it will produce as much as 25 percent of all active ingredients needed to make generic drugs in the USA. It's a big number, 25 percent. This agreement will directly create 360 new jobs at Kodak's factory in Rochester. That's just in the initial phase. And in Minneapolis, a place I have gotten to know very well, and it is a great place. And I'm very happy that we're able to help them with the problems that they have had recently. The National Guard, I want to thank the National Guard, both state and beyond. I want to thank them for the incredible job. They went in and they did some beautiful job. They cleaned it up. You didn't hear about the problems any more. And indirectly, I want to create -- we created thousands more jobs all across our pharmaceutical supply chains. We have now been building a very big pharmaceutical supply chain. Not only coming out of China, coming out of other countries also. I want to thank Peter Navarro, Adam Boler, and Admiral Polowczyk for their tremendous work to make this deal possible. Today's action is our latest step to build the greatest medical arsenal in history. We'll be able to do that through the Defense Production Act and other authorities. We have invested more than $3 billion in our nation's industrial base. We've contracted with companies such as Ford, General Motors, Phillips, and General Electric to produce more than 200,000 ventilators by the end of this year. Nearly seven times more than we would ever do in a typical year. We've contracted with Honeywell, 3M, O&M, Hillyard, MOLDEX, and Lydall to increase U.S. production of N-95 masks. And we've brought it from less than 40 million a month to over 100 million a month by August, and we'll have 160 million in a very short while, 160 million a month. That's many times what we use to do, if you go back two years ago, many, many times. We're increasing domestic production of gloves by 1,000 percent, 1,000 percent. We will be manufacturing 450 million gloves annually by next year. We're finalizing contracts with our textile industry to make gowns in America with American fabric, which makes a lot of our businesses happy that produce the fabric. We have 13 million reusable gowns in the stockpile, and we'll continue to grow that number to 72 million this fall, which is a rapid escalation indeed. We made major investments in new rapid point-of-care tests, so we have -- there is nothing like the rapid point where you get your answer in five minutes to 15 minutes, to maybe 20, 25 minutes at the max. And we're already at about a 50 percent level. And we're bringing it up substantially from there. We're growing domestic production from less than 250,000 test kits per month in May to 8 million test kits per month. There is nothing like this that has ever taken place anywhere in the world or close. Through our partnership Puritan Manufacturing in the state of Maine, great state, we've increased production of test swabs from 30 million per month in June to 56 million month now. I see you remember I went to Maine. I went to the plant where they do this. It was incredible. It was a great experience. And we will produce over 100 million swabs per month by January. We've dramatically ramped up production of materials needed for a vaccine and are on track to rapidly produce 100 million doses as soon as a vaccine is approved, which could be very, very soon, and 500 million doses shortly thereafter. So we'll have 500 million doses, and logistically we're using our military, our great military, a group of people. Their whole life is based around logistics and bringing things to and from locations, and they'll be able to take care of this locationally and bringing it where it has to go very, very quickly. They're all mobilized. It's been fully set up. A very, very talented general is in charge. And when we have that vaccine, it will be discharged and taken care of. It'll be a very, very rapid process all over the country. And perhaps we'll be supplying a lot of the vaccine to other parts of the world, like we do with ventilators and other things that we all of a sudden have become very good at making. When the China virus struck our nation, we mobilized the entire government and the private sector to acquire, source, and deliver lifesaving supplies. HHS, FEMA, and the private sector combined have coordinated the delivery of more than 196 million N95 respirators, 815 million surgical masks, 20 million gloves, 34 million face shields, and 354 million gowns. That's a lot of gowns. Last week, FEMA completed a second shipment of personal protective equipment to over 15,000 nursing homes in the United States. Our big focus has been on nursing homes and senior citizens. As you know, that's where we want to take care. We have to take care of the most vulnerable, especially if they have a medical difficulty, a medical problem, in particular heart or diabetes. We've provided a total of 1.2 million pairs of protective eyewear, 14 million masks, 66 million pairs of gloves, and 13 million gowns. We have replenished the long-neglected national stockpile. In January, the stockpile had 17.9 million N95 masks. Today the stockpile has over 50 million N95 masks, and we'll be doubling that in a very short period of time and then doubling that number. We've shipped more than 14,000 ventilators to areas of need across the country, and we've more than 75,000 available to deploy. Not a single American who has needed a ventilator has been denied a ventilator. And if you remember, early on, when we were first hit with the virus, ventilators were very hard to come by. And now, we're the largest maker anywhere in the world by far, and not only are we fully supplied in stock, but we're helping other nations, because ventilators are hard to build and hard to get. This is just the beginning. In the coming months, we will continue the largest onshoring campaign in American history. We will bring back our jobs, and we will make America the world's premier medical manufacturer and supplier. That's what's happening already. It's been happening now for quite some time. We're seeing improvements across the major metro areas in most hotspots. You can look at large portions of our country. It's corona-free, but we are watching very carefully California, Arizona, Texas, and most of Florida. It's starting to head down in the right direction, and I think you'll see it rapidly head down very soon. But if you look, California, Arizona, Texas, and for the most part, most of Florida starting to head down. In the wake of the recent mass gatherings Americans have witnessed in the streets of Portland and Seattle, we are also tracking a significant rise in cases in both metropolitan areas because of what's been going on. And we, as you know, have done an excellent job of watching over Portland and watching our courthouse, where they wanted to burn it down. There were anarchists, nothing short of anarchists, agitators, and we have protected it very powerfully. And if we didn't go there, I will tell you, you wouldn't have a courthouse. You'd have a billion-dollar burned out building. We're also working aggressively to combat the virus in Native American and Alaskan Native communities. Under the CARES Act, we provided $8 billion to address the coronavirus in tribal communities, and we've worked very hard with tribal communities. They're very vulnerable to this horrible plague. That's the largest investment in Indian country in U.S. history. There has never been an investment that big in Indian country. We need every American to help protect our fellow citizens and prevent the spread of the disease. It's critical that younger Americans remember that even though they are at lower risk and in fact, some age groups are at extraordinary low risk themselves, they can unknowingly spread the virus to others who are at higher risk. I ask all Americans regardless of background or age to practice social distancing, which people have gotten very used to, but we have to keep doing it. Remain vigilant about hygiene. Avoid indoor gatherings and large gatherings, but especially indoor, especially where you have crowded bars, and that you wear a mask whenever appropriate. Through the genius of our scientists, the devotion of our doctors, the skill of our workers, and the dedication of our people, we will achieve victory over the virus and emerge stronger than ever before. We're looking at a very powerful year next year economically. The job numbers are looking outstanding, to put it mildly, setting records. The numbers on retail sales came in two weeks ago at the highest number in the history of our country. So, we look like we're heading to some very, very good economic times. That means jobs. That means stock market. Stock market is already doing very well. It's getting to a point very close to where it was when we had this - - when we were hit with the plague. So, I just want to thank everybody for being here. Steve, please, go ahead. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Could you clarify your acceptance speech for the Republican nomination? Are you physically going to be in Charlotte, or will you give the speech here or somewhere else? TRUMP: We'll be doing a speech on Thursday, the main speech, the primary speech. Charlotte, they will be doing nominating on Monday. That's a different -- that's a different period, a different thing happening, but they'll be doing nominations on Monday. I speak on Thursday, OK? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: From where? TRUMP: We'll go -- we'll be announcing it soon. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: So, you could be going to Charlotte? TRUMP: Does anybody have any ideas? We'll be announcing it very soon. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Mr. President, the negotiations are ongoing right now for the next relief measures. Republicans -- Senate Republicans have put forth their plan. Do you support what Senate Republicans have put forward, and are there certain aspects that they have put forward that you don't support? TRUMP: Yes, there are, actually, and we'll be talking about it. There are also things that I very much support, but we'll be negotiating. It's sort of semi-irrelevant, because the Democrats come with their needs and asks and the Republicans go with theirs. So we'll be discussing it with Mitch and all of the other people involved. Kevin has been very active, as you know, all of the people involved. Steven Mnuchin has done a great job, keeps everybody together, both Democrat and Republican. And we'll see. We want to do what's best for the people. I want to do what's best with the people. I want to do what's best for the economy, because that means jobs and lots of good things, all right? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What Senate Republicans put forward, sir, what do you make of what Senate Republicans put forward? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Mr. President, two questions. First, can you clarify your position on the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine after you retweeted a video of making claims that it is effective? TRUMP: I wasn't making claims. The recommendations of many other people including doctors, many doctors think it is extremely successful, the hydroxychloroquine coupled with the zinc and perhaps the Zithromycin. But many doctors think it's extremely good, and some people don't. Some people -- I think it's become very political. I happen to believe in it. I would take it. As you know, I took it for a 14-day period, and I'm here, right? I'm here. I happen to think it works in the early stages. I think front line medical people believe that, too, some, many. So, we'll take a look at it. But the one thing we know, it's been out for a long time, that particular formula, and that's essentially what it is, the pill. It's been for malaria, lupus, and other things. It's safe. It doesn't cause problems. I had no problem. I had absolutely no problem. I felt no different. I didn't feel good, bad, or indifferent. And I tested it, as you know. It didn't -- it didn't get me, and it's not going to hopefully hurt anybody. So, we know because it's been so many years, from a safety standpoint, it's safe. I happen to think, based on what I've read -- I've read a lot about hydroxy. I happen to think that it has an impact, especially at the earlier years. There were some very good tests at Ford, and the doctor from Yale came up with a very, very strong testament to it. There was a group of doctors yesterday, a large group that were put on the Internet, and for some reason, the Internet wanted to take them down and took them off. I guess Twitter took them off, and I think Facebook took them off. I don't know why. I think they're very respected doctors. There was a woman who was spectacular in her statements about it, that she's had tremendous success with it, and they took her voice off. I don't know why they took her off, but they took her off. Maybe they had a good reason. Maybe they didn't. I don't know. I can only say that from my standpoint and based on a lot of reading and a lot of knowledge about it, I think it could have a very positive impact in the early stages. I don't think you lose anything by doing it, other than politically, it doesn't seem to be too popular. You know why? Because I recommend it. When I recommend something, they like to say, \"Don't use it.\" John, please. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: On that note, Mr. President, last night, you made tweets that were deleted by Twitter. You said that Dr. Fauci misled the country about hydroxychloroquine. How so? TRUMP: No, not at all. I don't even know what his stance is on it. He was at the -- he was at the task force meeting a little while ago. I have a very good relationship with Dr. Fauci. It's sort of interesting. We've listened to Dr. Fauci. I haven't always agreed with him, and that's, I think, pretty standard. That's OK. He did not want us to ban -- to put up the ban to China when China was heavily infected very badly, Wuhan. He didn't want to do that, and I did and other things. And He told me I was right, and he told me I saved tens of thousands of lives, which was generous, but I think it's you know, I think it's a fact. Then I did the ban -- I did a ban on Europe. But I get along with him very well, and I agree with a lot of what he said. So it's interesting. He's got a very good approval rating, and I like that. It's good. Because remember, he's working for this administration. He's working with us, John. We could have gotten other people. We could have gotten somebody else. It didn't have to be Dr. Fauci. He's working with our administration. And for the most part, we've done pretty much what he and others, Dr. Birx and others who are terrific, recommended. And he's got this high approval rating, so why don't I have a high approval rating with respect. And the administration with respect to the virus? We should have a very high. Because what we've done in terms of -- I was just reading off about the masks and the gowns and the ventilators and numbers that nobody's seen and the testing at 55 million tests. We tested more than anybody in the world. I have a graph that I'd love to show you. Perhaps you've seen it, where we're up here and the rest of the world is down at a level that's just a tiny fraction of what we've done in terms of testing. So it sort of is curious. A man works for us, with us very closely, Dr. Fauci, and Dr. Birx also, highly thought of, and yet they're highly thought of, but nobody likes me. It can only be my personality. That's all. Go ahead. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Could I just ask you, also, DHS announced today that it is going to undertake a thorough review of the DACA program to decide whether to continue it and, if not, how to disband it. You had mentioned after the Supreme Court ruling about DACA that you were thinking about a path to citizenship for DACA recipients. Are you still thinking of it? TRUMP: We're going to work with a lot of people on DACA, and we're also working on an immigration bill, a merit-based system, which is what I've wanted for a long time. That decision was an interesting decision, because it gave the President as a President more power than many people thought the President had. So the President is now, which happens to be me, in a position where I can do an immigration bill and a healthcare bill and some other bills, and you've seen some of them come along. We're going to do tremendous -- we just signed it three days ago. We're going to do tremendous prescription drug price reductions, tremendous. It could be over 50 percent. Whether it's favored nations clauses or anything else, I mean, it's tremendous numbers we're talking about. You know, you go to some countries, and they'll sell a pill for ten cents, and in the United States, it costs $2.00. And it's the same basic factory. It's the same everything. The United States bears the cost of all of these low prices that you see all over the world, where people go to Canada to buy a prescription drug from the United States. It's not going to happen with me. It's not going to happen with me. So John, I think one of the exciting things got very little coverage, and that's OK, but the people understand it. I think we will be reducing prescription drug prices by massive amounts, numbers that have never been done before. Other thing, in 51 years, we got, as you know, last year drug prices came down. The first time in 51 years that they came down. Now, with what I signed last week, I think that drug prices can come down by numbers like 50 percent and even greater in certain instances. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I wonder if I could come back to where I originally started. Are you still considering a path to citizenship for current DACA recipients? TRUMP: We are going to make DACA happy and the DACA people and representatives happy, and we're also going to end up with a fantastic, merit-based immigration system. Please. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes. On the drug pricing, you had said that pharmaceutical representatives would be here today for a meeting to talk about bringing drug prices down or to negotiate. That meeting was canceled. Why? TRUMP: I didn't know a meeting was canceled -- oh, a meeting with the drug -- UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: You said there would be a meeting today with drug companies. TRUMP: Well, I said there would be a meeting. Yes, a meeting sometime this week, yes. They want to meet. I mean, I don't know that it was canceled. They want to meet. I thought the meeting was actually scheduled for tomorrow. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: So, we'll see, I guess. TRUMP: I thought the meeting was scheduled tomorrow. Sorry about the dates. I see how upset you are by it. (CROSSTALK) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: On the FBI headquarters, sir -- on the FBI headquarters -- TRUMP: Go ahead, please, Bloomberg. Bloomberg, Mr. Bloomberg. You look like just a Mr. Bloomberg. Go ahead. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Thank you, Mr. President. Do you support a separate extension of supplemental unemployment aid if the deal that there has to be out of Congress isn't completed by the end of this week? TRUMP: We'll do something. We're going to take care of the people. Yes. That's a good question. We're going to take care of the people. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Mr. President, the woman that you said was a great doctor in that video that you retweeted last night said that masks don't work and there is a cure for COVID-19, both of which health experts say is not true. She's also made videos saying that doctors make medicine using DNA from aliens and that they're trying to create a vaccine to make you immune from becoming religious. TRUMP: Well, maybe it's a sign, maybe it's not, but I can tell you this. (CROSSTALK) TRUMP: She was on air along with many other doctors. They were big fans of hydroxychloroquine. I thought she was very impressive in the sense that from where she came, I don't know which country she comes from, but she said that she's had tremendous success with hundreds of different patients. And I thought her voice was an important voice, but I know nothing about her. Yeah, go ahead. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: She said masks don't work. Last week, you said -- TRUMP: Go ahead. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Real quick, last week, you said masks -- TRUMP: OK, thank you very much, everybody. Thank you. Thank you. (CROSSTALK) (END VIDEOTAPE) JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST: That was President Trump at the White House giving an update on the Coronavirus and talking about increased supplies of gloves, gowns, and even supporting some companies that could provide a vaccine in the future. We're back now with THE FIVE. Let me ask Jesse. Let me ask you. The President got into a real discussion there about his relationship with Dr. Fauci and criticism last night of Fauci. What do you make of that? JESSE WATTERS, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST: I thought it was hilarious that he says that, you know, I'm the guy that brought Fauci in, and he's got this rocket sky high approval rating. And you know, I'm doing everything pretty much that Fauci tells me. So the only reason the approval rating is different, it must be my personality. I thought that was pretty self- deprecating. I think we do want to -- do we want to get to Greg's book? Yes. WILLIAMS: Oh, yes, let's do that. WATTERS: And we'll get to Greg's book. As the resident reader on the show, me, it is only fair that I plugged Greg's new book. \"The Plus: Self-help For People Who Hate Self-help\" is out today. All right, Greg, I have a copy right here. It's not inscribed with anything nice. It's all just slander and some of the things I can't even say on television. But tell me about the book, why you wrote it, and maybe a suggestion for people that might need self-help. GREG GUTFELD, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST: I thought that I could become a more positive person. And if I could become a positive person, I would actually write about it. Because I have absolutely -- I am probably the most cynical least positive person. And I woke up and I thought, you know what, if I could just actually reverse this as an experiment, this was like a middle of the night thought, I'm going to do it. And I realized that it really was a psychological challenge because all of my issues in my life, the things that bother me, can be fixed psychologically. So that's what the book is about. The book is about how to deal with, I think, constant persistent issues in your life by just slightly changing it a little bit. That was my goal. So, it's weird that I'm actually doing a positive book. WATTERS: Right. You say you need to brainwash yourself. I definitely agree you've been brainwashed. I'm not sure if you've been becoming more positive or not. One of the things you said is if you aren't getting happier as you're getting older, you're doing it wrong, and resist the media's command to expand destructive narratives. Dana, have you read the book, did you get an early copy, and is this all what it's cracked up to be? DANA PERINO, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST: It is what it's cracked up to be. I did get a copy. In fact, we'll talk about a little bit later. We're going to do a little live signing later tonight. WATTERS: All right. PERINO: We all get to take some questions from readers who have bought the book. But, Greg, when you talk about that it, did you find it there was any certain trick or tip that you could use to go from having a negative thought to a positive thought? GUTFELD: Yes. You know what, I realized that all the negative thoughts come from a sunk cost because I've invested time and effort into something. It's like being in a bad relationship. And it's like, that's how you are with ideas. So, you might hold on to an idea for a long time because of the time itself being an investment. So realizing that a sunk cost is already gone, allows you to just let go of a lot of ideas and stuff that's been driving you crazy. But the best part is, and the thing that I found has been most constructive, is that allows me to admit when I'm wrong about something, and I can actually let go of mistakes that I made much easier than I did before. WATTERS: Juan, would you agree that Greg is now admitting when he's wrong a little bit more? WILLIAMS: You know what -- you know what caught my attention was Greg gave some interesting advice. He said don't tweet when you're drunk, and I thought, has this happened to Greg? How does Greg know this? GUTFELD: Because it has. Here's the deal. I want to -- here's the problem with tweeting and drinking. It's not that your tweets are bad, it's that the quantity increases, so you create more opportunities for getting in trouble. I wrote about this when the -- when the Covington kid incident took place that I was tweeting about it. I tweet about it once negatively about the Covington teen because I was sitting at a restaurant drinking it on a Saturday afternoon and I like, you always think your ideas are so important after two glasses of wine. And I'm -- if I had a -- so I always talk about that. I always eliminate the -- I eliminate the alcohol variable and life is a lot better when it comes to tweeting. It's not much better in other areas, but when tweeting it controls that. WATTERS: All right, Katie, you get the last shot. KATIE PAVLICH, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CONTRIBUTOR: Well, you can say something positive -- if you can say something positive about Twitter, I think that's a good thing, Greg. And I like the new Greg and the more positivity, but I want to know why you called it The Plus. I know there's a philosophy behind that. GUTFELD: It was the idea that I would look at every single thing that I was doing, especially on social media, and also in like in meetings and stuff and ask myself if what I was about to do was going to add anything or take anything away. So it became like a plus or a minus equation in my head. So I was walking around like the Terminator with this little thing going on in my head. Is what am I about to do -- what am I about to say to my wife plus or minus? And it ends up just shutting me up. I'm completely silent, although you really haven't noticed it here. WATTERS: Not at all, Greg. All right, so go get The Plus wherever books are sold. It is available now. And go check out Greg and Dana tonight doing a live signing somewhere. I'm sure it's going to be very interesting. And \"ONE MORE THING\" is up next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) PERINO: All right. It's time now for \"ONE MORE THING.\" I have some breaking news for you coming across the wires just now. We have exclusive footage of Greg Gutfeld going out on his book tour. If we could go to that please. Yes, Greg is willing to go to any lengths to get there to your book signing. There he is getting a hitching a ride across a lake just to get to the book sign of which we are going to do tonight 7:00 p.m. Eastern, 6:00 p.m. Central. I'll get to interview him. And you can find that also at our Facebook pages. It'll be on live. And you won't want to miss it because I'm really going to find out more about The Plus, a great book indeed. GUTFELD: Yes. PERINO: All right, Jesse. WATTERS: Dana, I'm going to be sending you some suggested questions that I'd like you to ask Gutfeld, so just keep your eyes on your e-mail. All right, Jesse's Hair News now as you guys watch. Look at the move. On Friday, we asked you guys if I should get a haircut. A bunch of people weighed in. Chiefsfancharlotte said yes sir, unless you are going to have to start singing Achy Breaky Heart. And even gut filled couldn't help himself commenting on Instagram. He should shave his head and paint it half blue. So he wants to see me naked only wearing a bolo tie and with my half shaven head, in blue. All right, the results are in. 45 percent say no, 55 percent say yes. So I am going to get a haircut. I'm going to get it tomorrow. And I'm just getting the back cut. We're just going to cut the mullet. We're going to keep the top long. And hey, stay tuned for more hair news. PERINO: Stay tuned indeed. All right, Juan, what do you have today? WILLIAMS: Well, I think you guys know Blue Bayou. That's a great song by Roy Orbison. I think you know, Blue Diamond. That's one of the rarest, most expensive gems. And maybe you know about the Blue Angels, the Navy flight team. But do you know about the blue lobster? Yes, they exist. And get this. The blue lobster existed at Red Lobster. I'm not joking. A blue lobster was found at the Red Lobster in Akron, Ohio. So the restaurant workers alerted an aquarium and they arranged for a new home -- new home for the blue lobster at the Akron zoo. The blue lobsters only occur one in every two million, Dana. It's a genetic anomaly. I can't tell you how it tastes but it sure looks cool to me. That's different. PERINO: 2020 it gets wilder and wilder. A blue lobster, I don't know. Katie, we're going to have to skip you today. But of course, we love having -- (CROSSTALK) PAVLICH: No problem. The blue lobster was fun. PERINO: -- Facebook. All right, \"SPECIAL REPORT\" is up next. We have Shannon Bream. Hi, Shannon.

I'm Bret Baier. Breaking tonight, President Trump says he is canceling the Jacksonville, Florida component of the Republican National Convention, the president saying just a short time ago, the business of the convention will take place in Charlotte, North Carolina, as was originally planned. We're expected to get more details about how all of that will play out in coming days. He notes the Jacksonville, Florida area is a coronavirus hot spot. The president once again defending his call for all students to return to classrooms this coming semester in that press briefing with reporters just a few -- short time ago. Senate Republicans and the administration officials have dropped the idea of a payroll tax cut from the negotiations over a new round of coronavirus aid. The Senate majority leader says he will release a framework for a new bill next week, they were hoping to do it this week. We'll talk live with the White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows about this and other topics in just a few minutes. This occurs as the U.S. passes the four million mark in infections, more than 143,000 Americans have died in this country. An associated press poll indicates three out of four Americans favor requiring people to wear masks outside of their homes. Here in the nation's capital, face coverings are now mandatory. Meantime, applications for first-time jobless benefits went up this week for the first time in months. Also breaking tonight, new Fox battleground state polls, the president trailing Joe Biden in three key battleground states, we'll bring that to you in a minute. Chief White House correspondent John Roberts starts us off though as he often does on the North Lawn. Good evening, John. JOHN ROBERTS, FOX NEWS CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Just a typical Thursday here at the White House, Bret. You'll recall that a couple of months ago, President Trump told Roy Cooper the governor of North Carolina, if he couldn't guarantee that they could have a big event in Charlotte for the big speech night at the convention, that they were going to move it. The president was happy to have it in Jacksonville he said this afternoon. His team came in with drawings of what they had put together, and he said the drawings were very compelling but the situation in Florida with the explosion in coronavirus cases, just meant that he could not go down there and have a large crowd to watch him give the acceptance speech, here's what the president said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I looked at my team and I said, the timing for this event is not right, it's just not right with what's happened recently. The flare up in Florida, to have a big convention is not the right time. It's really something that for me, I have to protect the American people. (END VIDEO CLIP) ROBERTS: So the president did not have an alternative at least at this point as to how he will give that big convention acceptance speech. It may be some sort of a virtual event, it may be something else but it's not going to be the big event that he had planned for Jacksonville. The president also as you mentioned at the top here Bret, talking about the issue of school reopening, saying that the Centers for Disease Control will in the next few hours come out with new guidelines that schools can use to decide whether or not they're going to reopen. But federal guidelines aside, this really comes down to a local and state level and on all of those levels, the debate is raging over what to do. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ROBERTS: Proponents of children going back to class point to science that shows they contract and transmit coronavirus at a far lower rate than adults. KAYLEIGH MCENANY, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: This president's been clear, we want schools to reopen. You have the CDC director saying it's a greater public health threat for schools to stay close than open. ROBERTS: Governors like Florida's Ron DeSantis trying to balance concerns about health with concerns about learning. GOV. RON DESANTIS (R-FL): In Florida, what we tell parents is look, if you're not comfortable with that, yes, you have the right to maintain distance learning, that's fine. We want to do what parent want but we have a lot of parents that think that their kids will fall behind if they're not able to get back inside the classroom. ROBERTS: A new Associated Press poll finds only eight percent of Americans say schools should reopen as usual, 14 percent would say it would be possible with minor adjustments but 46 percent say it would take major adjustments. And there is a big split between Democrats and Republicans over keeping schools closed, 44 percent of Democrats say schools should not reopen, just 14 percent of Republicans think that. On Capitol Hill, Senate Republicans say they have reached agreement on money for schools in a phase four relief package, $105 billion, about $1,200 per student. SEN. LAMAR ALEXANDER (R-TN): It's a very generous amount of money half to go to every school and the other half would go to try to encourage and help those schools that are trying to open in person. People that have -- when you have to hire extra teachers and put up barriers and buy a protective equipment, they're more expensive there. ROBERTS: Democrats who passed a $3 trillion monster phase four relief package back in May mocking their Senate colleagues for taking so long. SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY): They can't come together. Even after all this time, it appears the Republican legislative response to COVID is unified, unserious, unsatisfactory. ROBERTS: One thing that won't be in the Senate's phase four bill, a payroll tax cut. Republicans saying it won't happen but the president will still fight to eventually make it so. STEVEN MNUCHIN, U.S. TREASURY SECRETARY: Not in this but we're going to come back again. You know, there may be a CARES 5.0. The president again is focused on money and American workers and American pockets right now. ROBERTS: The relief bill aside, the White House has another coronavirus problem, a cafeteria worker at the Eisenhower Executive Office Building testing positive for the virus. The White House Medical Office has done contact tracing and determined no one else was at risk. But out of caution, the cafeteria and Ike's Eatery in the building will both close for two weeks. (END VIDEOTAPE) ROBERTS: Now, back on the president canceling the Jacksonville part of the Republican Convention. You know, during a campaign, there were really just a couple of moments -- big moments, where you can move the needle in terms of public opinion. There's the debates and then there's the convention and that big night with a speech. The present will give that up and will have to try to find a different way to move the needle, but the president saying this afternoon Bret, that setting the example is important, Bret. BAIER: John Roberts live on the North Lawn. John thanks. As we mentioned, breaking tonight at the top, we're giving you the first look tonight at new Fox polls for several battleground states. Not good news for the president in these polls, Joe Biden leads in Pennsylvania 50 to 39, the president has lost three points since April. In 2016, candidate Trump won that state by less than one percentage point. In Michigan, the margin is nine, 49 to 40, that's a one-point gain again for Biden. President Trump won that state four years ago by three-tenths of a percent. And in Minnesota, Biden is up 13 points, 51-38. Donald Trump lost that state in 2016 by 1-1/2 percent to Hillary Clinton. The two men who will be at the top of the ticket in November are spending this week arguing over racism. Joe Biden says President Trump is the first racist elected to the top job, the president says that's an affront to African-Americans and the Trump campaign is pointing back to Joe Biden's past comments. Correspondent Peter Doocy has the latest tonight. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PETER DOOCY, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Joe Biden believes 45 is a first. JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We've had racists and they've exist and they've tried to get elected president. He's the first one that has. DOOCY: President Trump's campaign says this is an insult to the intelligence of Black voters. And Trump himself is trying to add historical context. TRUMP: I've done more for Black Americans than anybody with the possible exception of Abraham Lincoln. DOOCY: 12 U.S. presidents at some point in their lives owned slaves, Woodrow Wilson name was just stripped from a school at Princeton because of his past segregationist policies. And Andrew Jackson is set to be replaced within a decade on the $20.00 bill design by Harriet Tubman after review of his record of mistreating slaves and Native Americans, but Biden insists, Trump is the first racist. BIDEN: The way he pets people against one another is all designed to divide the country, divide people. DOOCY: If there's one Biden attack on Trump that's been consistent since day one, it's this. Central theme of this announcement video was President Trump's response to deadly race riots in Charlottesville. BIDEN: He said there were, quote, some very fine people on both sides, very fine people on both sides? DOOCY: Registered voters in a new Fox News poll trust Biden over Trump in every leading issue in battleground Minnesota but Trump has more trust on the economy in battleground's Michigan and Pennsylvania. Now, Biden is hoping to hold his overall lead with help from his old boss. BARACK OBAMA, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: What kind of values are you communicating? BIDEN: Bingo. (END VIDEOTAPE) DOOCY: That's part of a 15-minute long streaming campaign video with Biden and Obama who reportedly got paid $15 million to develop streaming content for Netflix. But it appears he did this one for his former V.P. for free, Bret. BAIER: All right, Peter, thank you. Its official, one of the Portland protests that really have become nightly confrontations with law enforcement has officially now been declared a riot. That designation applies to last Saturday's event. Meantime, the Justice Department inspector general is launching a probe into law enforcement in Oregon and also federal efforts here in Washington, D.C. The situation in Portland puts into clearer focus President Trump's decision to put federal forces on the streets. Correspondent Dan Springer shows us the situation seems to be getting worse. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DAN SPRINGER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: It was one of the most violent nights yet in Portland. A new fence put up around the federal courthouse did not stem the chaos. Arsonists through Molotov cocktails and hundreds of fireworks over it, vandals cut through it. While Portland police state away, federal officers there to protect the courthouse and federal buildings repeatedly fired tear gas and deployed flash bang devices. Mayor Ted Wheeler showed up for what he called a listening session. But when he spoke, he was shouted down with obscenities, called a Nazi, spit at and told to resign. Then, while next to the fence, he was hit with tear gas, telling one reporter he saw nothing to provoke that response. After a second guessing, his security detail took him to cover in a nearby city building. It all happen the same day the city council passed a law banning Portland police from helping federal officers in any way, even in life-threatening situations. Oregon's governor joins the call for the Fed's delete. GOV. KATE BROWN (D-OR): This is a democracy, not a dictatorship. We cannot have secret police abducting people in to -- and putting them in unmarked vehicles. I cannot believe I have to say that to the president of the United States. SPRINGER: President Trump is sending federal agents to other cities not to protect federal buildings but to help solve murders and stem the tide of violent crime. Chicago will get 200 agents, Albuquerque 35. (END VIDEOTAPE) SPRINGER: The mayors of 16 cities signed a letter to President Trump saying they don't want any federal agents sent their way, among them the mayor of Seattle who battled Trump over the CHOP protest zone. And now comes word that the Seattle chapter of the Youth Liberation Front is planning a big protest here for this weekend, Bret. BAIER: Dan, thank you. Let's talk about the major issues facing this White House with a man on the inside, the inner circle, White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows. Thanks for being here. MARK MEADOWS, WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF: Great to be with you, Bret. Thanks so much. BAIER: First I want to talk about the breaking news, the president making that announcement about Jacksonville, he's -- was he disappointed? MEADOWS: Well, I think for all of us, we're disappointed that we can't have the convention but it's a responsible and really dedicated decision by the president of the United States to focus not only on the safety of those that might be attending but really on the safety of all Americans to keep focused on making sure that we combat this China virus and make sure that we have vaccines. And so, he made one of the most difficult decisions that any president or politician might have to make, which is saying that what we're going to do is put aside those partisan politics and make sure that we actually focus on what is key. And yet, it was an easy decision for him because he says we're going to put the American people first, we're going to focus on make sure that we get testing for those schools and day care centers and nursing homes done, but more importantly than that, open back our schools in a safe and responsible way. And we've been working around the clock with some of our colleagues on Capitol Hill to get that done. BAIER: Well, I want to talk about that. Where are you with that? There seem to be kind of this giant exhale upon Capitol Hill of frustration really that they couldn't get a bill out this week. Where are Republicans, where is your negotiation tonight? MEADOWS: Well, we've had a number of discussions with our Republican senators on Capitol Hill over the last couple of days, Secretary Mnuchin has done a great job in doing that. But I think the real frustration is really about trying to make sure that we focus on a couple of key components. We know that we have unemployment insurance and those who are still unemployed and receiving those benefits with that about to expire next week. We also know that we have businesses that continue to remain in unbelievably difficult circumstances. So what we're trying to do is focus on those priorities and yet, the Democrats have put together some $3 trillion. We found that they were not really serious about their effort that they put forth, so we're trying to make sure that we get the immediate needs first and then continue to negotiate perhaps throughout most of August until we get something finished. BAIER: Yes, here's how Politico wrote it this afternoon and I want to just get your reaction. MEADOWS: Sure. BAIER: Senate Republicans in the White House wasted a week at the worst possible time. Amid a series of crises with 30 million Americans unemployed, coronavirus cases spiking nationally White House officials, Senate GOP leaders couldn't even come to an agreement among themselves on a starting point for a new relief package, let alone begin bipartisan talks with Democrats. Privately, GOP lawmakers were flabbergasted that they'll likely have to wait until next week to unveil even an initial proposal. And we found out from the Senate Majority Leader that's exactly what it's going to be, a framework. Where is the sticking point? So there's a payroll tax is out, right? MEADOWS: Well, the president made that decision primarily because we knew that the Democrats saw that as an asked and something that would benefit all American wage earners. And yet, they -- because the president was asking for it, they made it clear that, that was a nonstarter for them. We did have some on the Republican side expressing concern. But instead of going all-in on that with the president, we made a decision to start focusing on not only the unemployment, insurance, but liability protection, the PPP extension, and help for schools. That $105 billion that you've already reported on. And so, where we are specifically is, is that we -- we're offering some of those things that help the people that are in most need right now. And yet, there is wish list. The $2 trillion or $3 trillion wish list that the Democrats are putting forth that are -- is just really beyond reasonable in terms of what they might consider is, is appropriate and realistic. So, I can tell you that the discussions continue on. We have line by line that we are going through that we -- we've gotten from our Republican senators, trying to make sure that it actually meets the needs of the American people. But I'm -- the president has made one thing clear. We're going to make sure that we have something there for those that are struggling the most, and that we keep this economy going, and I'm confident that we'll get there. BAIER: You know, your opponents are obviously jumping all over this. Saying, Republicans can get their act together on this, and it sends a message about November. What's your reaction to that? MEADOWS: Well, I mean -- listen, opponents on Capitol Hill, will always speak out against this president, they consistently do. When you look at a $3 trillion package that they put forth several weeks ago, not even their own members took it serious. I mean, when you look at the amount of money that they're asking for state and local health, they've actually put a number in there that equals their entire revenue for half a year. I mean, it's just -- it's not reasonable. BAIER: Yes. MEADOWS: It's not rational. And so, as we look at it, it's easy to put numbers on a piece of paper. That's what they've done, put numbers on a piece of paper. It's much more difficult to be responsible about that, because it's not our money, it's the American taxpayer's money. BAIER: You know what I hear a lot though? I hear a lot that -- you know, why can the Democrats: Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer, cracked the whip and get Democrats to fall in line, but Republicans can't when push comes to shove. And I ask you this as a former member of the House Freedom Caucus, who stood up against the number of votes that the party wanted to do. (CROSSTALK) MEADOWS: Yes. Sure. Right, well, it's really easy when you're spending someone else's money, Bret. Eventually, you run out of other people's money. We already know that and just because we're starting to talk about a trillion here or a trillion there, it doesn't make it responsible. The bill that the Democrats have put forth is not even reasonable when it comes to the needs. Even with their best estimates, they have to smile when they put forth some of the numbers. And I can tell you, we'll get to the -- to the bottom of it, we'll make sure that we do it right. The president is committed to that. BAIER: How concerned are you about polls inside the White House? We have these new state polls where the president's approval-disapproval is upside down in these three key states, Michigan, Minnesota, and Pennsylvania. Trust on the job on coronavirus, even on the economy, the edge is really, really tight. How concerned are you about all of this? MEADOWS: Listen, I don't talk about the polls, I look at policy because policy always drives the polls. When you put two things in place, the policy and the people is your number one priority, it always works out at the end. And ultimately, the only poll that counts is in November. When you look at, at what we're seeing though, is we've had a president that has not only performed before but will do it again. And the great thing is -- about all of this is, is that we actually have a president who has a track record, you know, it's not someone in a basement without one. BAIER: Yes, I want to follow up on something you told Maria Bartiromo over the weekend. And you said that the American people expect indictments in this investigation of the investigation. MEADOWS: Right. BAIER: The Durham report we haven't heard when it's coming out. If it's coming out, do you have any sense of when it's coming and what may be holding it up? MEADOWS: Well, that's under the Department of Justice. I wouldn't have any visibility in terms of a time frame with John Durham in the investigation that he is conducting. I can tell you this based on documents that I saw in my previous career, based on what I know going forward. There should be accountability, the American people expect it. And yet, at the same time, they would be extremely disappointed if people are not held accountable. This president indeed was spied on, and he was spied on by a government that shouldn't be involved in that, and those people do need to be held accountable. BAIER: We appreciate your time. Please come back and you think something will come together next week? MEADOWS: Well, we will certainly have something for the Democrats to vote on next week. And I can -- I can tell you, it's going to put the people of America and those that are suffering the most as our number one priority. BAIER: White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, thanks. MEADOWS: Thank you. BAIER: Up next, it's finally time to hear play ball for Major League Baseball. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, FORMER FOX NEWS POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: But all the glory, you know, and with the White House on fire, the Congress in chaos, and the world going to hell in a handbasket, we need happy news like this. This is why God created baseball late on the sixth day. (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: Wise words from the late great Charles Krauthammer. By the way, I was wearing the same tie that day. Our dear friend was the biggest Washington Nationals fan of all. We are just an hour away from hearing those words, play ball, for the first time, in what will be an abbreviated Major League Baseball season because of coronavirus. The first game features the defending World Series champion Washington Nationals hosting the New York Yankees. Lucas Tomlinson is at Nationals Park tonight. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) LUCAS TOMLINSON, FOX NEWS STATE DEPARTMENT PRODUCER: It's not the start Major League Baseball had in mind, but after nearly four months, baseball is back but in empty stadiums. Dr. Fauci will be throwing out the first pitch tonight at Nats Park, and while he's become somewhat of a celebrity in the fight against coronavirus, he tells Nationals' first baseman Ryan Zimmerman, he's not feeling as confident about throwing out the first pitch. DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES: And I'm quite nervous about it. Yes. RYAN ZIMMERMAN, FIRST BASEMAN, WASHINGTON NATIONALS: OK. Well, don't worry about it, if you bounce it, there's nobody there to boo you. So, you'll be good to go. You're fine. TOMLINSON: There are some new rules for the 60-game season. The National League adds a designated hitter, a runner on second base will begin extra innings, and there'll be no face-to-face arguments with umpires. Major League Baseball, also announced it will show support for the Black Lives Matter movement. Earlier this week, some San Francisco Giants players and the manager kneeled during the national anthem at an exhibition game. Nancy Pelosi praised the move. REP. NANCY PELOSI, (D-CA): I'm so proud of Gabe Kapler, our new general manager who knelt with them. TOMLINSON: Unlike the NBA and NHL, all 30 big league clubs will travel around the country over the next two months. The Nationals will play in some COVID hot spots and make a 10-game road trip in three cities which could make it challenging for any contact tracing if anyone tests positive for coronavirus. Even though stadiums will be empty, Fox Sports will be adding thousands of virtual fans in the seats during broadcast, so people at home can have a feel of a sold-out stadium. (END VIDEOTAPE) TOMLINSON: Late this afternoon, Nationals general manager Mike Rizzo, announced his star outfielder Juan Soto, tested positive of the coronavirus and is out for tonight's season opener, Bret. BAIER: All right. Lucas, thank you. We'll have to see how that virtual fan thing works. Stocks were down today because of initial jobless claims rising for the first time since March. We told you about that earlier. The Dow lost 353- 1/2. The S&P 500 dropped 40, the NASDAQ plummeted 245. Up next, the canceled culture eating its own. We'll explain. First, here is what some of our Fox affiliates around the country are covering tonight. Fox 5 in New York as a judge ordered the release from prison of former Trump personal lawyer Michael Cohen. The judge, saying he believes the government retaliated against Cohen for writing a book about President Trump. A book expected to be very negative to the president. Cohen, sued the government earlier this week, saying he was ordered back to prison on July 9th over the book issue. Fox 9 in the Twin Cities as Minnesota Democrat Governor Tim Walz, signs a police accountability bill into law. It includes a ban on neck restraints like the one used on George Floyd before his death in Minneapolis. Bill also prohibits chokeholds and so-called warrior style training, which critics say promotes excessive force. And this is a live look at Austin, Texas from our affiliate Fox 7. One of the big stories there tonight, a storm watch is in effect for the Texas coast after the formation of a tropical depression in the Gulf of Mexico. The system is expected to become Tropical Storm Hanna, Friday, before making landfall south of the Houston area. That is tonight's live look \"OUTSIDE THE BELTWAY\" from SPECIAL REPORT. We'll be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BAIER: A cautionary tale tonight for the so-called cancel culture. The arbiters of the latest fad of political correctness continue to chip away at traditional American figures, but they also are turning on members of the liberal culture from which they came. Correspondent Doug McKelway shows us this evening. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY): Mobs have dragged statues of Washington, Jefferson, and Grant through the dirt. DOUG MCKELWAY, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: While Mitch McConnell was attacking the so-called cancel culture on the Senate floor Wednesday, the House was debating whether to remove 16 statues, including the bust of Supreme Court Chief Justice Roger Taney, a Democrat and author of 1857 Dred Scott decision that denied African-Americans citizenship. REP. STENY HOYER (D-MD): What Dred Scott said was black lives did not matter. We assert that yes, they do matter. MCKELWAY: On Tuesday Planned Parenthood removed the name of its founder, Margaret Sanger, from its New York City clinic. Sanger advocated for sterilization to stop the reproduction of, quote, \"inferior people.\" BENJAMIN WATSON, FORMER NFL PLAYER: That's surprising considering what they said over the last several years about her, giving out awards in her honor and touting her as a hero. But now is a time of reckoning, as it should be. MCKELWAY: A similar cancelling for John Muir, the father of national parks. He founded the Sierra Club which announced it's ending its association with Muir, describing him as a, quote, \"white supremacist\" who drew on deeply harmful racial stereotypes. As many as 80 global and American companies, some often identified as progressive, are also facing uncomfortable pressure. Republican Senator Josh Hawley introduced a bill on Monday that would hold them accountable for what Hawley says is slave labor in their supply chains. Among those cited by Hawley, Nike, Adidas, Puma, Lenovo, Samsung, Starbucks, and Nespresso. Asked recently what she thought of cancel culture and the tearing down a Columbus statue, Speaker Pelosi said this. REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA): People will do what they do. MCKELWAY: In Pelosi's childhood home of Baltimore, a statue of Columbus was toppled and throw into the Inner Harbor this month. Statues of Confederate Generals Robert E. Lee and Stonewall Jackson were taken down two years ago after Charlottesville. They had been dedicated in 1948 by her father, Mayor Thomas D'Alesandro, who said that the statues, quote, \"remind us to be resolute in preserving our sacred institutions.\" (END VIDEOTAPE) MCKELWAY: On Wednesday, the House voted to remove all 16 statues, but 113 members, all Republicans, voted against it, and it's doubtful the Senate will take up anything similar. Bret? BAIER: Doug McKelway up on the Hill. Doug, thanks. The main focus tonight in legal proceedings against a woman accused of helping late financier and pedophile Jeffrey Epstein recruit underaged girls appears to be what information becomes public now. Correspondent Laura Ingle looks at the latest decisions. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) LAURA INGLE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: The documents in question date back to a civil defamation case filed against Ghislaine Maxwell by Jeffrey Epstein accuser Virginia Giuffre. The case was settled and the documents sealed. Many have since been unsealed, like ones that detailed Giuffre's accusations that Maxwell made her have sex with Prince Andrew at age 17. Giuffre is fighting to release more. Maxwell is fighting to stop it, citing potential embarrassment. The judge ruling against her, saying, quote, \"any minor embarrassment or annoyance resulting from disclosure of Ms. Maxwell's mostly non-testimony about behavior that has been widely reported in the press is far outweighed by the presumption of public access.\" The judge deciding to release thousands more pages, including the transcript of Maxwell's seven-hour long deposition, and why she is facing perjury charges today. The judge ruled nearly all the remaining documents should be released, but the names of certain John Doe's not yet made public should remain redacted. A name once known to run in Maxwell's circles is President Trump, something he admitted this week. TRUMP: I've met her numerous times over the years, especially since I lived in Palm Beach, and I guess they lived in Palm Beach. But I wish her well. INGLE: But as Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany points out, President Trump banned Jeffrey Epstein from Mar-a-Lago long ago. KAYLEIGH MCENANY, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: This president was always on top of this, ahead of this, noting this, banning this man from his property long before this case was even played out in a court of law. (END VIDEOTAPE) INGLE: Despite the judge's ruling to release these long awaited and potentially explosive documents, there will be nothing to read for at least a week while Maxwell's lawyers file an appeal. Bret? BAIER: We'll follow it. Laura, thank you. New York Democratic Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez used some shocking language today on the House floor because she was quoting what a Republican colleague said to her. Her comments come following a verbal exchange with Florida Republican Ted Yoho Monday in which he used the profane sexist slur that the congresswoman repeated in her speech. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. ALEXANDRA OCASIO-CORTEZ, (D-NY): In front of reporters, Representative Yoho called me, and I quote, a -- These are the words that Representative Yoho levied against a congresswoman. (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: We added the beep. Yoho has apologized for what he called his, quote, abrupt manner. Ocasio-Cortez did not accept that apology. When we come back, will President Trump withdraw all U.S. forces from Afghanistan? (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BAIER: Witnesses in Afghanistan say a government air strike killed at least 14 people, many of them women and children. It happened as hundreds of them gathered to welcome a former Taliban fighter freed from jail. The U.S. peace envoy to Afghanistan tweeted a condemnation of the strike, welcoming a government investigation. One of President Trump's campaign promises from 2016 was to end what he called America's involvement in endless wars. It's a message he continues to deliver to this day. But is that strategy working? Here is national security correspondent Jennifer Griffin. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JENNIFER GRIFFIN, FOX NEWS NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: A peace deal with the Taliban the Trump administration hopes will allow U.S. troops to come home after 19 years of war, past the 135 day mark this week. But the agreement, signed in February, remains fragile. CENTCOM Commander General Frank McKenzie had this warning in an interview with \"Voice of America.\" GEN. KENNETH F. MCKENZIE, CENTCOM COMMANDER: And while the Taliban have been scrupulous about not attacking U.S. or coalition forces. In fact, the violence against the Afghans is higher than it has been in quite a while. GRIFFIN: The U.S.-Taliban deal calls for a full U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan within 14 months, something the president campaigned on and hopes to achieve by November. TRUMP: We want to bring our people back home. GRIFFIN: Since February, the U.S. has drawn down to 8,600 troops and withdrawn from five bases in Afghanistan as part of the deal, roughly the same number of troops as when President Obama left office, down from a high of 100,000 in 2010. No U.S. troops have been killed in Afghanistan since the deal was signed. The Pentagon continues to say it has found no evidence the Russians paid bounties that led to the death of any American troops. JONATHAN HOFFMAN, CHIEF PENTAGON SPOKESPERSON: We've not found any corroborating evidence that would indicate that there was a bounty program. GRIFFIN: Secretary of State Mike Pompeo spoke to his Russian counterpart about working together in Afghanistan. MIKE POMPEO, SECRETARY OF STATE: We think it's in Russia's best interest. We think it's in China's best interest. We know it's in the Afghan people's best interest. (END VIDEOTAPE) GRIFFIN: The House version of the National Defense Authorization Act includes an amendment from Democrat Jason Crow of Colorado and Liz Cheney of Wyoming that would require the administration to make several certifications to Congress before it can draw down any further in Afghanistan. Bret? BAIER: Jennifer Griffin at the Pentagon. Jennifer, thank you. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told an audience at the Nixon Library in California the U.S. ordered Beijing to close its consulate in Houston because it was a hub of spying and intellectual property theft. Tonight on \"The Story\" with Martha MacCallum, Pompeo talks at length about the deteriorating U.S. relationship with China. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) POMPEO: When you see what the Chinese Communist Party has done to our country and to the world with their failure to live up to another set of promises that they made to the world about their responsibility if a pandemic began to break out in their country, the cover-up that took place, you can absently understand why a trade deal like the phase one trade deal no longer ranks first of all the various issues we have with the Chinese Communist Party. (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: Secretary Pompeo, you can see that interview with Martha at the top of the hour. The U.S. is accusing Russia of conducting a test of antisatellite weapons in space, saying it's Moscow's intent to deploy weapons that threaten U.S. and allied satellites. The head of the British space agency agreed, writing on Twitter Russia launched a projectile with characteristics of a weapon. Russia says the event was an inspection of a satellite using special equipment. Next up, the panel with reaction to today's presidential news conference and the cancellation of Jacksonville as the RNC convention, plus my interview with the White House chief of staff. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: I looked at my team and I said the timing for this event is not right. It's just not right, with what has happened recently, the flare up in Florida, to have a big convention. It's not the right time. It's really something that for me, I have to protect the American people. (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: President Trump canceling the Jacksonville, Florida, part of the convention. If you remember, it was eight weeks ago he moved from Charlotte, North Carolina, because of too strict health situation, he wanted to have a bigger party atmosphere. But within eight weeks, the spike in Florida changed this, and he has canceled that, so now making plans for a very different Republican convention. This as some new key battleground state polls come out tonight. FOX polls Michigan, Minnesota, Pennsylvania, and you can see Joe Biden leading in all of those, various numbers there. The president's job performance upside- down, underwater in all three states, Michigan, Minnesota, and Pennsylvania. And then this is probably the biggest spread, trust to do a better job on coronavirus in those three states, 19, 23, and 18 points difference in our latest FOX News poll. Let's bring in our panel, Matthew Continetti, founding editor of the \"Washington Free Beacon,\" Julie Pace, Washington Bureau Chief for the Associated Press, and Jason Riley, \"Wall Street Journal\" columnist and senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute. Julie, you're at the White House, pay attention to all that stuff day-to-day, quite a turnaround, and obviously the situation in Florida changed the dynamic completely. JULIE PACE, WASHINGTON BUREAU CHIEF, ASSOCIATED PRESS: Absolutely. I think this is the president bending to reality here and really recognizing that, whether he likes it or not, this is an election that is very much going to be decided on how Americans view his handling of the pandemic. And he can't wish it away. He is the commander-in-chief and he is ultimately responsible for the health and safety of Americans. And so there was this huge contradiction between him planning to move forward with a big convention, with hundreds of people, thousands of people jammed into a space, and then his administration advising Americans to avoid those exact kind of situations. And so I think ultimately it just became untenable for him to move forward with a traditional convention. BAIER: Matthew, the White House chief of staff, Mark Meadows, saying that it's a very tough decision for a politician. Obviously, it's a launching point for the campaign. But he said it was an easy decision that happened quickly for President Trump when he faced the dangers of what Jacksonville may look like. MATTHEW CONTINETTI, EDITOR IN CHIEF, \"WASHINGTON FREE BEACON\": Look, I think it was a concession to reality. I also think it's a signal of Trump's new tone that he's trying to communicate that he's taking the virus seriously. It also frees him up, I think, to give a more creative address to the nation. But it also says to me, Bret, that this election will really depend more so than usual on the debates. Those will really be one or three instances where we have both candidates in a traditional setting up against each other. The conventions don't matter as much, there's no campaign trail rallies. It will come down, I think, to the debates. BAIER: Jason, take a listen to the Senate minority leader and the Senate minority leader on these negotiations about the next stimulus bill. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY): Even after all this time, it appears the Republican legislative response to COVID is ununified, unserious, unsatisfactory. MCCONNELL: Our proposal will not waste the American people's time with go- nowhere socialist fantasies. We aren't choreographing political stunts or teeing up the same old partisan trench warfare. Our proposal will focus on three things -- kids, jobs, and health care. (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: Senator McConnell saying they will have a framework of a bill. And you heard the White House chief of staff saying there is disagreement within the GOP, and they are giving Democrats the opportunity to hammer them on this issue at least in the short term. JASON RILEY, \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\" COLUMNIST: Yes, that's what we're hearing, Bret. I think that the Republicans have this right. We've had the previous stimulus packages. I think they can only do so much. There's going to be diminishing returns in terms of what the government is trying to do. We've got to get people back to work, and we can't disincentivize them to get back to work. We also have to get kids back to school in order for people to go back to work. Those two things cannot be divorced from one another. So I would like to see a bill that acknowledges that we do need to get this economy up and running again, and puts safety first, obviously, but also weigh the health costs and the financial costs of this lockdown. BAIER: Julie, A.P. poll on school reopening K through 12 schools, open as usual, eight percent, minor adjustments, 14 percent, major adjustments 46 percent. A lot of focus today on the open as usual being only eight percent, but if you add it all up, you're at 68 percent that want it open somehow, schools. So this is going to be a big issue. PACE: It absolutely is. The majority, as you cite in our poll there, wants schools to open. But most people do want to see some kind of adjustments. And I think that's where the struggle is very real for a lot of school districts and a lot of parents. What are those adjustments? What is feasible? What allows you to send a child back in a way that allows them to both be safe and have a productive learning atmosphere right now. And I think the reality that we're seeing from a lot of major school districts in a lot of parts of the country is that they just don't think that they can get there and make those kinds of decisions in the next couple of weeks. And so they are trying to put this decision off until probably the beginning of 2021, which leaves a lot of people in a really tough spot, certainly, for the next couple months. BAIER: I know, in limbo. It's tough. Matthew, very quickly, you think these tighter news conferences, these briefings are helping the president? CONTINETTI: Well, I hope we'll see that emerge in the polls, Bret. But the key is right now, Trump is not running against Biden. He's running against the coronavirus. And in order to win in November, he has to lead on the coronavirus. BAIER: All right, panel, as always, thank you. When we come back, the brighter side of things, some good news. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BAIER: Finally tonight, a pair of special surprises. Joanna Lauby thought she was doing a photo shoot with her two-year-old daughter Annelise. Little did she know her husband Nate turned it into a surprise reunion. Nate's an Army Reserve staff sergeant. He's been deployed overseas since July. Came home early. That's a happy day. When Cameron Andrade returned home after a seven-month deployment with the U.S. Navy, his wife was not the only one happy to see him. Check this out. Cameron's dog Brody could not contain his excitement outside their home in Connecticut. That dog knew. He wagged his tail, ran around furiously. Welcome home Cameron and Nate, thank you for your service. Thanks for inviting us into your home tonight. That's it for this SPECIAL REPORT.

Trevor Reed, a student at the University of North Texas, was spending time in Moscow to learn Russian and visit his Russian girlfriend, when he went to a party with heavy drinking. He was detained by officers Aug. 15 after leaving the party. Reed is accused of grabbing one officer as he was driving, causing the car to swerve dangerously, and elbowing the other \u2013 all of which the American claims he can\u2019t remember because he was intoxicated. He was detained for nearly a year awaiting his trial. \u201cThis conviction, and a sentence of nine years, for an alleged crime that so obviously did not occur, is ridiculous,\u201d said John Sullivan, the U.S. ambassador to Moscow. \u201cThis was theater of the absurd.\u201dReed pleaded not guilty in court after hearing what he described as flimsy evidence against him. Prosecutors also failed to provide video evidence that could possibly exonerate him,  reported. \"I think it would be unethical and immoral to plead guilty to a crime I didn't commit,\" Reed said during closing arguments on Wednesday. \"If I am going to be given a prison sentence, I'd rather stay in prison than walk free tomorrow a liar and a coward.\"Nevertheless, the court handed down a guilty verdict and a nine-year sentence \u2013 close the maximum of 10 years in prison allotted for an assault charge in the country. \"This is completely a political case,\" Reed told reporters after the verdict was announced, according to  \"I will be asking my government for political support.\"His girlfriend, Alina Tsybulnik, said that a colleague was driving them both home from the party last August when Reed became sick. The driver stopped the car and called police when Reed stopped responding, thinking he might need\u00a0medical attention. Tsybulnik claims Reed was asleep in the back seat of the police car \u2013 that\u2019s why officers didn\u2019t handcuff him \u2013 and that, as she followed in a car behind them, the police car never swerved on its way to the station,  reported. Some speculate Reed\u2019s sentence was handed down in order to secure him as a bargaining chip in\u00a0a prisoner swap between Moscow and Washington. In June, another U.S. citizen Paul Whelan \u2013 who also formerly served in the Marines \u2013 was convicted of espionage in Russia and sentenced to 16 years in a maximum-security prison. And\u00a0an American businessman, Michael Calvey, is being held on house arrest in Russia for fraud charges against an associate of Russian President Vladimir Putin. Calvey has denied any wrongdoing. The attorney representing Whelan has said he believes Moscow wants to trade\u00a0his client for Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout, who is serving time in a U.S. prison, according to Reuters.
