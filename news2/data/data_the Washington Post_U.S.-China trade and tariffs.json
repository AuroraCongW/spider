Subscribe today.arrow-rightAfter more than three years of President Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d administration, that world is long gone.The average U.S. tariff on Chinese products is at its highest level in at least 40 years. The U.S. has abandoned the Obama administration\u2019s signature pact, the Trans-Pacific Partnership. And organized labor has muscled its way into greater prominence in shaping trade bargains.ADNavigating this landscape represents a challenge for Biden, who backed a 1994 trade deal with Mexico and subsequent legislation allowing China into the global trading system, both of which Trump and the Democratic left have long assailed. The president already is taking shots at his likely Democratic rival, accusing him in a television ad released this month of destroying millions of manufacturing jobs with \u201cdangerous and foolish\u201d trade deals.ADIt\u2019s easy to see how Biden, who promises to court U.S. allies and to emphasize climate change, would differ from Trump. But the Democratic candidate has sketched an approach to trade that also would depart from the corporation-friendly orthodoxy of the Clinton and Obama years.He told the United Steelworkers union he would insist on \u201cstrong rules of origin\u201d in any new trade deal, which would require more manufacturing in the U.S. while complicating corporate planning. He vowed to crack down on provisions of the tax code that encourage outsourcing, especially in the pharmaceutical industry. And he ruled out the establishment of special tribunals for corporations to dispute actions by U.S. trading partners, which critics have called a private justice system.ADBiden also says he will not complete any new trade deals before first making \u201cmajor investments\u201d in education, infrastructure and manufacturing. And he proposes spending $400 billion on a \u201cBuy America\u201d initiative designed to boost domestic production and build greater resilience into critical supply chains.ADIf pursued in office, the new stance could mark a turn after more than a quarter-century of pro-business tilt for the Democratic Party, some analysts said.\u201cI think we\u2019re in a new world in trade policy,\u201d said Beth Baltzan, a former trade lawyer on the House Ways and Means Committee\u2019s Democratic staff. \u201cPeople understand that a somewhat blind faith in free trade is producing undesirable results.\u201d Biden releases U.S.-centered economic plan, challenging Trump\u2019s \u2018America First\u2019 agendaThe dangers of an increasingly authoritarian China coupled with the coronavirus pandemic\u2019s disruptive effects is prompting a rethinking even among die-hard globalization supporters. The results can be seen in Biden\u2019s recent call for \u201cfundamental reforms that shift production of a range of critical products back to U.S. soil\u201d \u2014 a statement that Peter Navarro, the administration\u2019s most fervent proponent of economic nationalism, could endorse.ADADSupporters of protectionism say Biden could reorient the party\u2019s trade stance away from its reflexive tilt toward corporate priorities. Though harshly critical of Trump\u2019s approach to China, the likely Democratic candidate has promised no quick rollback of the tariffs on Chinese products that U.S. corporations have panned.\u201cThere\u2019s been an evolution among national Democrats on trade policy, and the centerline is not where it used to be,\u201d said Scott Paul, head of the Alliance for American Manufacturing, a union-industry group.To be sure, corporations are attempting to have influence over a potential Biden administration. Securities and investment firms alone have contributed more than $36 million to his campaign and outside groups supporting his candidacy, according to Open Secrets, a nonpartisan group. And many business leaders take solace from the fact that even if the former vice president can\u2019t revive the pro-globalization consensus, he will not continue Trump\u2019s capricious trade-policy-by-tweet.ADAD\u201cThey realize things probably won\u2019t go back to the old world,\u201d said Rufus Yerxa, president of the National Foreign Trade Council, an industry group. \u201cBut it will be a lot more stable than the present world.\u201d Still, as the Washington adage goes, personnel is policy. And many of Biden\u2019s key advisers are veterans of previous Democratic administrations that reduced trade barriers, promising that any jobs lost to low-wage countries would be more than offset by gains from additional exports.While Biden has pledged to name representatives from unions and environmental groups to trade enforcement positions, those who hope he will break decisively with his Democratic predecessors are not yet declaring victory.AD\u201cThe decisions,\u201d said Paul, \u201care made once you\u2019re in office.\u201d The struggle for influence between labor and capital has significant political ramifications.ADIn 2016, Trump barnstormed the industrial Midwest, arguing that the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement and the decision to allow China to join the global trading system in 2001 had eliminated millions of American jobs. That position helped him capture Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin on his way to the presidency.Trump also did better at the polls with union members than any Republican since Ronald Reagan, cutting in half the Democrat\u2019s 2012 margin among labor households. In office, the president has followed through on his campaign promises by raising tariffs on goods from China as well as on steel and aluminum.ADBiden has said he will \u201creview\u201d those levies on industrial metals and will use other tariffs \u201cto win, not just to fake toughness,\u201d according to his answers to a United Steelworkers candidate questionnaire.ADBoth parties supported the integration of low-wage developing countries into the global economy for decades before Trump took office. In the 1990s, President Bill Clinton drew the Democratic Party closer to Wall Street and corporate America in a bid to shed an anti-business image that previously hurt the party.Labor unions have generally opposed trade deals like NAFTA, fearing they opened the door to the exodus of good-paying factory jobs. NAFTA\u2019s labor provisions were tucked into a side letter rather than the treaty itself and did little to prevent that erosion, according to union critics.ADSome advocates of a trade policy that would place greater emphasis on labor and environmental concerns are not yet convinced that a Biden administration would mark a genuine break with the party\u2019s recent history.AD\u201cOur members, they\u2019re cautious on Biden. They look back on his record with TPP, in particular,\u201d said one veteran union official, who asked not to be identified to preserve relationships with the Biden campaign. \u201cThese things are very fresh in the minds of people.\u201d But during the George W. Bush administration, Biden voted against smaller trade deals with Chile, Singapore, Peru and several Central American nations. And some of the veteran Democratic operatives in Biden\u2019s camp have rethought the party\u2019s conventional wisdom.ADJake Sullivan, who served as Biden\u2019s national security adviser, has called for \u201ca different course\u201d on trade, explicitly challenging Obama\u2019s TPP and the conventional wisdom that more trade is always better for the U.S. economy.\u201cForeign policy experts must dispense with the notion that what\u2019s good for U.S.-based multinational corporations is necessarily good for the United States,\u201d wrote Sullivan, and co-author Jennifer Harris, who worked on economic issues for then-secretary of state Hillary Clinton, in a February article in Foreign Policy.ADThe Biden campaign did not respond to a request for comment.Some of the criticisms from the Democrats\u2019 left wing echo those of the Trump administration. Robert E. Lighthizer, the president\u2019s chief trade negotiator, has criticized the TPP for provisions that would have allowed China to establish factories in participating countries and export from there to the U.S. on a duty-free basis. And Trump has employed tariffs freely as a weapon to compel foreign nations to purchase additional American goods.\u201cHe gets credit for being willing to go where other people weren\u2019t willing to go,\u201d said Baltzan, a fellow with Open Markets. \u201cBut we need to remember these arguments started with Democrats.\u201d Biden has said he will renegotiate the 2016 TPP, which was intended to be a counterweight to Chinese influence in Asia. The original agreement included the investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS) system that the former vice president now rejects. Lighthizer, and some Democrats, have criticized the arrangement as an inducement for corporations to ship jobs to low-wage countries, even if their legal system is unreliable.The ISDS panels have long been a standard feature of trade agreements, but the system was largely eliminated in the new U.S.-Mexico-Canada agreement. Only a handful of industries, including energy and telecommunications, retained the ability to pursue claims against the Mexican government before an independent arbitrator rather than in the domestic courts.Some labor officials say the NAFTA replacement that Lighthizer negotiated should be a model for Biden to follow. The new U.S.-Mexico-Canada agreement contains rules of origin designed to steer more manufacturing to high-wage American plants. And it allows U.S. officials to block at the border goods that originate in Mexican factories that violate the deal\u2019s labor provisions.\u201cThe people surrounding Biden have learned a lot post-TPP,\u201d said Cathy Feingold, director of the AFL-CIO\u2019s international department. \u201cThere\u2019s a recognition that trade policy was tilted too much in favor of corporations.\u201d ", "comment": "0 Comments", "topic": "Economy"}, {"cover": "", "title": ", technology and security at risk in US- feud", "date": "Jul 27, 2020", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/technology/trade-technology-and-security-at-risk-in-us-china-feud/2020/07/27/434f1d54-d071-11ea-826b-cc394d824e35_story.html", "keyword": "U.S.-China trade and tariffs", "website": "the Washington Post", "author": "", "content": "BEIJING \u2014 They have the largest economies in the world.

But the president, still trying to fashion himself as an outsider, offers little detail about how he\u2019d pull the levers of government in a second term.Support our journalism. Subscribe today.arrow-rightBiden, for his part, sounds every bit the Democratic standard-bearer as he frames the federal government as the collective force to combat the coronavirus, rebuild the economy and address centuries of institutional racism and systemic inequalities. A veteran of national politics, Biden also loves framing his deal-making past as proof he can do it again from the Oval Office.ADADIt leaves Americans with an unambiguous choice. A look at where the rivals stand on key issues:ECONOMY, TAXESDecades-low unemployment and a soaring stock market were Trump\u2019s calling cards before the pandemic. While the stock market has clawed much of its way back after cratering in the early weeks of the crisis, unemployment stood at 11.1% in June, higher than the nadir of the Great Recession. There were still about 14.7 million fewer jobs last month than there were prior to the pandemic in February.Trump has predicted that the U.S. economy will rebound in the third and fourth quarters of this year and is set to take off like a \u201crocket ship\u201d in the new year, a prediction that bakes in the assumption that a coronavirus vaccine or effective therapeutics have hit the market that allow life to get back to normal. He\u2019s still advocating for a payroll tax cut, though such a measure faces stiff bipartisan opposition. Winning a second term \u2014 and a mandate from voters \u2014 might be his best hope at getting it through.ADADBiden pitches sweeping federal action as necessary to avoid an extended recession or depression and to address long-standing wealth inequality that disproportionately affects nonwhite Americans. His biggest-ticket plans: a $2 trillion, four-year push intended to eliminate carbon pollution in the U.S. energy grid by 2035 and a new government health insurance plan open to all working-age Americans (with generous subsidies). He proposes new spending on education, infrastructure and small businesses, along with raising the national minimum wage to $15 an hour.Biden would cover some but not all of the new costs by rolling back much of the 2017 GOP tax overhaul. He wants a corporate income tax rate of 28% (lower than before but higher than now) and broad income and payroll tax hikes for individuals with more than $400,000 of annual taxable income. All that would generate an estimated $4 trillion or more over 10 years. Biden frames immigration as an economic matter, as well. He wants to expand legal immigration slots and offer a citizenship path for about 11 million residents who are in the country illegally but who, Biden notes, are already economic contributors as workers and consumers.EDUCATIONADADTrump has used his push for schools to fully reopen this fall amid the pandemic as an opportunity to spotlight his support for charter schools and school choice.Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, a longtime proponent of charter schools and school voucher programs, has suggested that families be allowed to take federal money allotted to school districts that don\u2019t open and spend it in private schools that do open. For most of Trump\u2019s first term, his administration has sought major increases to federal charter school grant aid. But Congress has responded with relatively small increases.With higher education, Trump has repeatedly complained that campuses are beset by \u201cradical left indoctrination.\u201d He recently threatened to defund universities, saying that he was having the Treasury Department reexamine tax-exempt status and federal funding of unspecified schools.ADADBiden wants the federal government to partner with states to make public higher education tuition-free for any student in a household earning up to $125,000 annually. The assistance would extend to everyone attending two-year schools, regardless of income. He also proposes sharply increasing aid for historically Black colleges. His overall education plans carry a 10-year price tag of about $850 billion.He calls for universal access to prekindergarten programs for 3- and 4-year-olds; tripling Title I spending for schools with higher concentrations of students from low-income households; more support for non-classroom positions like on-campus social workers; federal infrastructure spending for public school buildings; and covering schools\u2019 costs to comply with federal disability laws. Biden also opposes taxpayer money being routed to for-profit charter school businesses, and he\u2019s pledged that his secretary of education will have classroom teaching experience.HEALTH CAREADADAs a candidate for the White House, Trump promised that he would \u201cimmediately\u201d replace President Barack Obama\u2019s health care law with a plan of his own that would provide \u201cinsurance for everybody.\u201d In the last leg of his first term, Americans are still waiting for Trump to make his big reveal. Trump officials say the administration has made strides by championing transparency on hospital prices, pursuing a range of actions to curb prescription drug costs and expanding lower-cost health insurance alternatives for small businesses and individuals. But those incremental steps are far short from the sweeping changes Trump had promised.Biden wants a \u201cMedicare-like public option\u201d to compete alongside private insurance markets for working-age Americans, while increasing premium subsidies that many working-class and middle-class workers use already under the Affordable Care Act. Biden estimates that would cost about $750 billion over 10 years. That positions Biden between Trump, who wants to scrap the 2010 law, and progressives who want a single-payer system to replace private insurance altogether. Biden sees his approach as the next step toward universal coverage and one he could get through Congress.CORONAVIRUSADADAfter months of insisting that the worst days of the pandemic have passed, Trump recently acknowledged that the pandemic may \u201cget worse before it gets better\u201d as many states \u2014 including several critical to his path to 270 Electoral College votes \u2014 have seen a surge in the virus.Trump is again holding regular briefings to directly get his message out on the virus and other matters. Trump believes that a key to economic recovery from the virus is fully reopening schools -\u2014 though Americans are wary. Only about 1 in 10 Americans think day care centers, preschools or K-12 schools should open this fall without restrictions, according to a recent poll by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs.Trump also says he\u2019s \u201cpretty damn certain\u201d that vaccines and therapeutics for the virus are coming in the not-so-distant future \u2014 a game changer as Americans and the world seek a glide path to normalcy. Congress approved about $3 trillion in coronavirus relief in March and April, and Democrats, Republicans and the White House are negotiating another significant round of funding. The package, however, won\u2019t include a payroll tax cut \u2014 something that Trump badly wanted but that Senate Democrats and even some Senate Republicans balked at including.ADADBiden draws some of his sharpest contrasts with Trump on the pandemic, arguing that the presidency and federal government exist for such crises. Trump, by contrast, has largely shifted responsibility to governors. Biden endorses generous federal spending to help businesses and individuals, along with state and local governments, deal with the financial cliffs of the pandemic slowdown. He\u2019s promised aggressive use of the Defense Production Act, the wartime law a president can use to direct certain private-sector activity. Additionally, Biden promises to elevate the government\u2019s scientists and physicians to communicate a consistent message to the public, and he would have the U.S. rejoin the World Health Organization. He\u2019s also willing to use executive power for a national mask mandate, even if its enforcement is questionable.TRADETrump views the signing of two major trade deals \u2014 an updated pact with Mexico and Canada and Phase 1 of a China agreement \u2014 as signature achievements of his presidency. U.S. and China signed Phase 1 in January, less than two months before the coronavirus pandemic put an enormous strain on U.S.-Sino relations. Trump says Phase 1 led to China buying roughly $200 billion over two years in U.S. agricultural products, energy and other American products. In return, the U.S. canceled planned U.S. tariffs on Chinese-made smartphones, toys and laptop computers. The U.S. also cut in half, to 7.5%, the tariff rate levied on $120 billion in other China imports.ADADPhase 2 of the deal is expected to focus on some tougher issues between the countries, including Trump\u2019s wish to get China to stop subsidizing its state-owned enterprises. But for Trump, who has come to frequently refer to the coronavirus as the \u201cChina virus,\u201d it remains to be seen whether he will be able to effectively reengage Beijing on trade. Trump recently said he\u2019s \u201cnot interested\u201d in presently talking to China.Biden has joined a growing bipartisan embrace of \u201cfair trade\u201d abroad \u2014 a twist on decades of \u201cfree trade\u201d talk as Republican and Democratic administrations alike expanded international trade. Biden wants to juice U.S. manufacturing by directing $400 billion of federal government purchases to domestic firms (part of that for buying pandemic supplies) over a four-year term. He wants $300 billion in new support for U.S. technology firms\u2019 research and development. Biden says the new domestic spending must come before he enters into any new international trade deals. He pledges tough negotiations with China, the world\u2019s other economic superpower, on trade and intellectual property matters. China, like the U.S., is not yet a member of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the multilateral trade agreement that Biden advocated for when he was vice president.FOREIGN POLICYDuring his first term, Trump built his foreign policy around the mantra of \u201cAmerica First.\u201d Besides the trade deals, he counts as major achievements building more than 200 miles (320 kilometers) of his promised wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, cajoling more NATO members to fulfill their pledge to spend 2% of GDP on defense spending and reducing the U.S. military footprint in Afghanistan and other hot spots. He also announced his intended withdrawal from the Paris climate accord.Trump can officially withdraw the U.S. from the Paris agreement \u2014 it sets the goal of holding global warming below 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit \u2014 as an example of an agreement that \u201cdisadvantages the United States to the exclusive benefit of other countries.\u201d The deal, which was signed by Obama, stipulates that no nation can leave until four years after they signed on. For the U.S., that\u2019s Nov. 4 \u2014 one day after the U.S. election.The president has also made clear his desire to leave Afghanistan sooner than the timeline laid out in the Feb. 29 peace agreement with the Taliban, which set the path for U.S. troops to leave the country in 12 to 14 months if the insurgent group met certain conditions. There are currently about 8,600 U.S. troops in Afghanistan.Trump also counts his engagement with North Korea\u2019s Kim Jong Un as a monumental achievement. The president has not been able to prod Kim to give up the nation\u2019s nuclear program, but he has met the autocrat twice for face-to-face talks.Biden says he\u2019d begin \u201cthe day after the election\u201d rebuilding relationships with allies ruffled by Trump\u2019s approach. Biden\u2019s top priority is reestablishing the foundations of NATO, the post-World War II alliance of Western powers that Biden said is necessary to counter Russia\u2019s aggressive, expansionist aims in eastern Europe and Asia. Biden said he\u2019d immediately confront Russian President Vladimir Putin about his country\u2019s interference in U.S. elections. Biden pledges to \u201cend forever wars\u201d but clarifies that U.S. special forces \u2014 as opposed to large-scale ground missions \u2014 remain a vital part of world stability. Biden frames immigration and combating the climate crisis as national security matters. He calls for rebuilding a decimated U.S. diplomatic corps, rejoining the Paris climate accord and pushing China and other large economies to reduce carbon pollution. On immigration, Biden calls for expanding legal immigration opportunities while reversing Trump\u2019s cuts to foreign aid programs intended to promote world stability and reduce migration.Copyright 2020 The Associated Press.

Subscribe today.arrow-rightAll this has many observers \u2014 even in the White House \u2014 speaking of a new \u201cCold War\u201d between the United States and China. Some even argue that this is desirable, presumably with the belief that our side will naturally emerge victorious.ADADYet the phrase is a misleading one. It assumes that the terms of the old Cold War between the Soviet Union and the United States, which we fought and won, are relevant, and that the tools used successfully then could be used again now.This conceptual error ignores the many differences between then and now. It is worth recalling that the Soviet Union was not our major trading partner, was not a major holder of our debt and was not tightly interconnected in the supply chains critical to our (and the world\u2019s) economy.The Cold War was fought and won pretty much exclusively on military and cultural terms. The economic side was relevant only because the Soviets' doomed model inhibited any real competition. We were neither competitors nor partners in the economic space. A new Cold War between the United States and China would be something else entirely. It is difficult to see how it could be fought effectively, not to mention successfully.ADADThis is by no means to question the need to respond to increasingly aggressive behavior by China. But the U.S. response must be coherent, disciplined and sophisticated. It must balance capabilities and objectives. Reverting to a Cold War mentality will drive us toward belligerent posturing that has little or no chance of changing Chinese behavior and could, on the contrary, provoke overreactions and dangerous miscalculations on both sides.Above all, we must create a deliberate strategy that is aimed at managing this great-power conflict rather than vanquishing a foe. This is very hard work, requiring patience, conviction and broad political support. It also requires the full participation of our allies, both in the region and elsewhere. We must undertake these efforts with the imperative of preventing a downward spiral toward armed conflict.Too often, U.S. policy toward China seems to be motivated by the urge to score points for short-term political benefit. Yet the Chinese are clearly pursuing their foreign policy goals according to a carefully calculated long-term strategy.ADADThat Chinese long game was defined first by Xi Jinping\u2019s successful internal campaign to secure the regime\u2019s survival, which has now positioned him at the head of an explicitly totalitarian state. Beijing\u2019s long-term strategy also includes an extremely ambitious foreign policy agenda, aimed first at shifting the center of the world economy to Eurasia through the Belt and Road Initiative.At the same time, China is pursuing increasingly aggressive territorial ambitions, including the clear intention to absorb Taiwan into the People\u2019s Republic. Our decades-long coherent management of this issue is increasingly challenged.China\u2019s strategy also aims to encircle the West technologically, dominating all the advanced systems of data collection and manipulation, including artificial intelligence, robotics, aerospace and quantum computing, always taking into account potential military applications. China has recognized, far earlier and far more clearly than any of the rest of us, that technology is the determining factor in the decisive battle of this moment in history. Beijing is working hard to create an overwhelming Chinese advantage in this battle. We must win this conflict with coherent strategies and, crucially, by cultivating the support of allies.ADADIn response to these and other challenges, the rest of the world, hopefully led once again by the United States, must respond with unity and long-range vision. Nearly spontaneous and seemingly unconnected irritations such as closing a consulate, imposing sanctions on a few officials, tweaking tariffs or sanctioning individual companies merely provoke countermeasures that will inhibit real management of this immense and complicated problem.Most importantly, policies by the United States and our allies must be aimed at expanding the diplomatic and political space to work these issues creatively and productively. This will take time. And it will also require the rebuilding of alliance cohesion and multilateral institutions capable of responding to China\u2019s long-term strategic vision with policies of comparable coherence and strength. As we know from the past, only the United States can forge those tools. Our allies and other like-minded nations are beginning to recognize the threats China poses to our common future. They will become increasingly receptive to enlightened leadership from the United States.Read more:ADADHugh Hewitt: Pompeo\u2019s speech opens a bold new chapter in U.S.-China relationsRichard Haass: What Mike Pompeo doesn\u2019t understand about China, Richard Nixon and U.S. foreign policyMax Boot: No one does more to hurt America and help China than TrumpThe Post\u2019s View: China has just broken its solemn promise to Hong KongEzra F.

Subscribe today.arrow-rightAfter topping $1,800 per ounce in 2011, it\u2019s taken nearly a decade for gold to surpass that level. Gold closed Monday at a record $1,931 an ounce after briefly climbing to $1,941.90 an ounce. Analysts at BofA Global Research say gold could reach $3,000 per ounce.Several factors are pushing gold higher: Investors are anxious about the pandemic\u2019s ultimate impact on the economy, worried over resurgent tensions  between the U.S. and China, and fearful of runaway inflation as spending to cushion the economic fallout swells the federal budget deficit.ADADUncertainty over the outcome of the elections in November may also be giving investors reason to hedge their bets with gold.Meanwhile, the market\u2019s sharp rebound from its lows in March is making stocks look expensive relative to earnings. Based on forward 12-month earnings, the S&P 500 is trading at a 50% premium to its 20-year average. That\u2019s likely making an asset like gold more attractive even as stocks continue to rally, said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA.\u201cThere are many bricks in this wall of worry,\u201d Stovall said.Here is a closer look at the main reasons behind gold\u2019s run to a record:THE PANDEMICThe biggest reason for the surge is fear surrounding the pandemic. No one knows how many people the new virus will ultimately kill \u2014 or how much of the world\u2019s economy it will destroy. That sways investors toward the metal that has long been considered a safe haven for wealth in turbulent times. A resurgence of confirmed cases of the coronavirus has put a damper on Wall Street\u2019s hopes for a relatively quick economic recovery as some states curtail plans to reopen businesses. Optimism for a full economic recovery now rests almost entirely on the successful development of a vaccine  and therapies to treat patients suffering from COVID-19.ADADU.S.-CHINA TENSIONSWorries over U.S.-China tensions have also drawn investors to gold. Washington and Beijing had reached a first-stage trade agreement in January, but tensions between the two nations have grown heated again, adding new worries about the potential for the world\u2019s two largest economies to impose tariffs on each others\u2019 goods.THE DOLLARMany investors see gold as a way to protect against a falling U.S. dollar, and the greenback is at its lowest level against the Swiss franc in more than five years. The U.S. Dollar index, which measures its value against the Swiss franc and five other major currencies, is at its lowest level in more than two years. A weaker dollar also makes gold cheaper for investors buying in other currencies, because it\u2019s priced in dollars.ADLOW INTEREST RATESADFor nervous investors, the safest places to put their money are Treasury bonds and gold. But Treasurys are paying close to the lowest amount of interest in history, with a 10-year Treasury note yielding just 0.58%. After taking inflation into account, investors are probably losing purchasing power by holding a Treasury that long. That makes gold more attractive in comparison.THE DEFICITThe federal government\u2019s budget deficit hit $864 billion in June, the biggest monthly budget shortfall in history. The deficit has ballooned as spending on programs to combat the coronavirus recession have exploded while millions of job losses have cut into tax revenues. A surging federal budget deficit heightens the risk of inflation and may be contributing to investors\u2019 appetite for gold. Investors have historically seen gold as a way to protect against inflation.\u201cInflation did not spike the last time we flooded the economy with cash, but it did so in previous periods in history,\u201d Stovall said.Copyright 2020 The Associated Press.

In the U.S., it\u2019s seen as an attack on American companies, while in Europe it is seen as an attempt to get a fair share of tax, he said.ADGermany, which currently holds the six-month rotating presidency of the EU and sets the bloc\u2019s policy priorities during that time, is one of the countries willing to wait on the tax portfolio until after the election, one of the officials said.Discussions at the OECD on a global digital tax have become so chaotic that the EU has weighed tabling its own proposal, while countries including Austria, France, Italy and the U.K. have already announced or implemented their own national levies.ADWhile France\u2019s tax has already taken effect, President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s government temporarily suspended collecting the revenue until the end of the year. The U.S., which says the levy unfairly targets American companies, announced this month 25% tariffs on a series of French goods worth about $1.3 billion in response to the French measures.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P.", "comment": "0 Comments", "topic": "Business"}, {"cover": "", "title": "AP-NORC poll: Trump, Biden supporters diverge on issues", "date": "Jul 27, 2020", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/ap-norc-poll-trump-biden-supporters-diverge-on-issues/2020/07/27/4dbf1e56-d03a-11ea-826b-cc394d824e35_story.html", "keyword": "U.S.-China trade and tariffs", "website": "the Washington Post", "author": "", "content": "Washington \u2014 As Election Day nears, a new poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research finds supporters of President Donald Trump and Democratic rival Joe Biden diverge on many issues central to the campaign.Support our journalism.

Subscribe today.arrow-rightThe State Department\u2019s abrupt order shutting down the Chinese Consulate in Houston this week is a case study in Mr. Trump\u2019s counterproductivity. It will inevitably lead to the permanent closure of a comparable U.S. mission in China \u2014 probably in Wuhan, where the covid-19 epidemic originated. That will reduce channels of communication and diminish U.S.\u2009understanding of China\u2019s domestic situation, while doing next to nothing to address the offensive activities of the Xi regime, from its crackdown in Hong Kong to its attempts to spy on Americans and steal U.S. technology.U.S. officials are describing the Houston consulate as a nest of espionage activities, though they have offered no evidence to back that up. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo portrayed the closure as sending a message: \u201cWe are setting out clear expectations for how the Chinese Communist Party is going to behave, and when they don\u2019t, we\u2019re going to take actions that protect the American people, protect our security, our national security, and also protect our economy and jobs.\u201dADADThat\u2019s good campaign rhetoric \u2014 but closing consulates won\u2019t accomplish those aims. Most Chinese hacking and spying is directed from China, not Houston. Many of the other measures Mr. Trump has taken, from imposing tariffs on U.S.-China trade to restricting student visas, have damaged the U.S.\u00a0economy and cost jobs without changing Chinese behavior.Mr. Trump\u2019s crusade \u2014 including racist references to the \u201cChinese virus\u201d and \u201ckung flu\u201d  \u2014 would be more plausible if it did not represent an abrupt, election-season U-turn. Until March, Mr. Trump was publicly praising Mr. Xi as a great leader, including in his response to the coronavirus. In private, Mr.\u2009Trump reportedly begged the Chinese ruler for help with his reelection campaign while approving of Mr. Xi\u2019s crackdowns in Hong Kong and on the Uighurs of Xinjiang province. In the trade deal he struck with Mr. Xi in January, Mr. Trump gave up demands for meaningful reforms in China\u2019s trade practices in pursuit of pre-election soybean purchases from Midwestern farmers.The president has since come to see greater electoral benefit in blaming Beijing for the spread of covid-19 while portraying opponent Joe Biden as a Chinese puppet. Some of the resulting flurry of measures are worthy, if long overdue: Under heavy pressure from Congress, the administration finally imposed sanctions on officials and companies involved in the Xinjiang and Hong Kong crackdowns.ADADYet this in no way represents a cogent strategy for countering Mr. Xi\u2019s ambition to spread China\u2019s model of dictatorship around the world and forcibly silence critics at home and abroad. That would require coordination with U.S. allies \u2014 such as Germany, South Korea and Japan, which Mr. Trump instead threatens with trade wars or the withdrawal of U.S.\u00a0troops. It would mean reviving the Trans-Pacific Partnership on trade. And it would require leaving open channels for diplomacy with Beijing to address issues such as North Korea\u2019s growing nuclear arsenal and global warming. Closing consulates will achieve none of that.Read more: Max Boot: No one does more to hurt America and help China than TrumpThe Post\u2019s View: What\u2019s happening in Xinjiang is genocideThe Post\u2019s View: China gutted Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy.

Malaysian and U.S. prosecutors had alleged the bond sales provided one of the means for associates of ex-Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak to steal billions from the fund. Najib is on trial on multiple corruption charges after his election ouster in May 2018. Goldman and 19 of its former executives were also charged in the fraud.___Airbus moves to end 16 years of litigation, end US tariffsADPARIS \u2014 European planemaker Airbus says it is taking the last step to end 16 years of litigation with the United States at the World Trade Organization. The manufacturer said it will end a system of financial support from France and Spain that the WTO had deemed illegal and unfair to Airbus rival Boeing. The Trump administration used the case as justification to slap tariffs on $7.5 billion worth of European exports. The U.S. tariffs covered not only Airbus planes but also a range of typical European exports, from gouda cheese to single-malt whiskey.AD___Schlumberger slashes 21,000 jobs amid pandemic oil routHOUSTON \u2014 Schlumberger is cutting more than 21,000 jobs as the global coronavirus pandemic quashes demand for energy and oil prices are routed. The company will pay more than $1 billion in severance benefits. The job cuts announced Friday, about a quarter of its entire workforce, puts the number of people employed by the world\u2019s largest oilfield services company close to where it was at the start of the oil and gas fracking boom that upended global energy markets and put the U.S. on top. Chesapeake Energy, a pioneer in fracking, sought bankruptcy protection last month.AD___US new home sales jump 13.8% in JuneWASHINGTON \u2014 Sales of new homes rose a sharp 13.8% in June, the second straight increase after two months when sales plunged as the country went into lockdown because of the coronavirus. The Commerce Department reported that the June gain pushed sales of new homes to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 776,000. The increase followed a 19.4% jump in May sales. The sales increase for new homes sales followed a report Wednesday that sales of previously owned homes surged 20.7% in June to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.72 million. Even with the gain, which followed three months of declines, new home sales remain roughly 20% below pre-pandemic levels.ADAD___Intel\u2019s stock plunges as work on new computer chip bogs downSAN RAMON, Calif. \u2014 Intel is falling further behind in the race to build faster and more powerful computer chips, a nagging problem that may force the Silicon Valley pioneer to seek help from other manufacturers as it scrambles to catch up in the technological arms race. The sobering news emerged late Thursday when Intel disclosed that there will be a six-month to one-year delay on its development of a next-generation chip already being shipped to some of its rivals by a major Taiwan supplier, TSMC. Intel\u2019s stock plunged nearly 16% Friday to wipe out more than $40 billion in shareholder wealth.AD___Wall Street down after worldwide slide; gold at record highNEW YORK \u2014 Stocks fell on Wall Street Friday as tensions flared again between the world\u2019s two largest economies, jitters continued over the fallout from the coronavirus and companies turned in a mixed batch of earnings. The S&P 500 lost 0.6%. Markets fell more sharply across Asia and Europe after China ordered the closure of the U.S. consulate in the western city of Chengdu.

That\u2019s according to an Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll. It\u2019s a sharp change from April, when 78% of those in households with a job loss thought they\u2019d be temporary. It\u2019s a sign of increasing pessimism that would translate into roughly 10 million workers needing to find a new employer, if not a new occupation. Still, the poll shows 72% of Americans would rather have restrictions in their communities to stop the spread of COVID-19 than remove them to help the economy.AD___White House, GOP at odds over jobless aid in virus billWASHINGTON \u2014 Negotiations over the next COVID-19 rescue bill are in flux. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell sent senators home for the weekend, promising a Republican proposal would be ready on Monday. Outraged Democrats warned that time is wasting on GOP infighting as the virus worsens. One sticking point for Republicans trying to develop their plan with the White House is how to trim back a $600 unemployment benefit boost. Republicans say it\u2019s too generous and creates a disincentive for workers to get back on the job.AD___The S&P 500 dropped 20.03 points, or 0.6%, to 3,215.63.

The following month, the government set aside $2.2 billion in its coronavirus economic recovery package to subsidize that process.ADADIt has now announced a list of companies that will benefit from the first round of subsidies, with 57 companies receiving a total of $535 million to open factories in Japan and 30 others paid to expand production in Vietnam, Myanmar, Thailand and other Southeast Asian countries.China is Japan\u2019s largest trading partner, but Japan\u2019s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) has been trying for several years to reduce the country\u2019s dependence on its giant neighbor. The 2008 global financial crisis, the 2011 northeastern Japan earthquake and the coronavirus pandemic all disrupted supply chains, while U.S.-China trade tensions are also a factor.\u201cWe already started to see the risks of the vulnerability of the supply chain, and we encouraged industries to look at such risks and asked them to diversify their source of supply,\u201d a METI official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity under ministry policy, said in an interview. \u201cWe think this is another chance to rethink global supply chains.\u201dADADThe subsidies aim to cover suppliers of the sorts of goods needed in an emergency \u2014 such as masks \u2014 as well as industries where supplies can be disrupted by an economic shock.Companies that are benefiting include producers of auto and aviation parts, hygiene products such as alcohol-based sanitizers, fertilizer, medicines and paper products. Iris Ohyama was the first company to take advantage of the subsidy and is using the money to open a factory to produce masks in Sendai in northeastern Japan, to complement existing plants in the Chinese cities of Dalian and Suzhou.\u201cWe decided to produce inside Japan a portion of the production consumed in Japan,\u201d said Executive President Akihiro Ohyama in an interview.ADIris Ohyama has gradually been shifting production out of China in recent years, due to higher wage costs there, as well as tighter environment regulations, and recently higher tariffs to export from China into the United States.ADIn addition to plants in Taiwan, South Korea and Vietnam, it has opened factories in France and the United States to be closer to markets there, with plastic containers, plastic pet cages, small electrical items and masks made or soon to be made in Wisconsin, Arizona and Texas.\u201cI think we are at the beginning of a new phase of globalization,\u201d Akihiro Ohyama said. \u201cNot many companies have yet been doing what we have been doing. But going forward, I think more companies will follow.\u201dADHe said large items such as refrigerators and washing machines that involve complex supply chains will continue to be produced in China and East Asia, but other production may shift.\u201cI think we will see a trend, a shift in producing goods in large volume where personnel costs are low, to places closer to where they are consumed,\u201d he said.ADAkihiro Ohyama said he viewed the trend very positively, with local production providing local jobs, and less shipping benefiting the environment.For Japanese automakers, though, the shift may be less marked; most have weathered the initial virus shock and decided to remain in China.A survey of Japanese companies, subsidiaries and affiliated companies in China conducted by the Japan External Trade Organization found 22 percent saying in April they planned to expand their business in China, up nearly seven percentage points from March. A similar survey found just 5.6 percent considering relocating out of China, down from 9.6 percent in March.ADIndeed, Damien Ma of the MacroPolo think tank argued in a commentary in June that East Asia supply chains had in general survived the coronavirus shock, largely because this part of the world has dealt with the pandemic more successfully than the West.ADThe METI official said it was unrealistic to bring all production home, adding that Japan\u2019s vision is different from U.S. Trade Representative Robert E. Lighthizer\u2019s view that the era of offshoring is over. Instead, Japan wants a combination of domestic and overseas production, together with international cooperation \u2014 especially when it comes to emergency supplies.\u201cWe are not retreating from globalization, but we have to update globalization,\u201d he said. \u201cJapanese companies have to adjust to that new normal, but globalization is still on the way.\u201dAkiko Kashiwagi contributed to this report.Britain bars Huawei from 5G wireless networks, part of shift away from Chinese tech giantU.S. sanctions additional Chinese companies, alleging human rights violations in Xinjiang", "comment": "0 Comments", "topic": "Asia & Pacific"}, {"cover": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/DZIN3HGDQUI6VNHWZM443CKA7M.jpghttps://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/DZIN3HGDQUI6VNHWZM443CKA7M.jpg", "title": "Biden finds a better way to do \u2018America First\u2019", "date": "Jul 16, 2020", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/biden-finds-a-better-way-to-do-america-first/2020/07/16/b0eafa20-c79f-11ea-b037-f9711f89ee46_story.html", "keyword": "U.S.-China trade and tariffs", "website": "the Washington Post", "author": "Fareed Zakaria", "content": "With the pandemic overshadowing everything, one can sometimes forget that there is a presidential campaign going on.

Biden proposes raising spending by $300 billion over four years, which represents a 60 percent increase over 2018 spending. If enacted, this would reverse the steady decline in federal investment in science and technology since its heyday in the 1950s and 1960s. (To get to those levels would still require hundreds of billions more.) Those investments led to the personal computer, the Internet, the Global Positioning System and a host of other technologies that have transformed the economy. More recently, it is worth remembering, an Energy Department loan of $465 million is what enabled Tesla to establish itself and experiment with electric cars. The Biden plan proposes investments in 5G technology, electric cars, lightweight materials and artificial intelligence.

But the danger of this kind of approach is that it can too often become \u201cindustrial policy,\u201d with the government trying to revive bygone industries like steel (as Biden wants to do) and favoring firms with the best lobbyists. More generally, the track record of most rich countries in practicing industrial policy has been pretty bad. Experts used to point to Japan as the country that had mastered government-directed investment, except that it turned out that Japan\u2019s best companies all came out of its fiercely competitive private sector. The state-sponsored ones mostly did poorly. (China is different because its biggest advantage is not smart government investments but low wages.)The best model is not for government to set up or subsidize specific companies or industries, but to let the market know that it will buy certain kinds of innovative products, which then gives the private sector an incentive to produce them. As late as 1962, the U.S. government was responsible for purchasing 100 percent of all semiconductor chips produced in the country, which is what allowed that industry to become viable. Similarly, NASA orders powerfully helped the computer industry in the 1960s. Biden rightly wants to emulate this approach to support today\u2019s breakthrough technologies, though key agencies in the federal government in those days were more efficient and operated with far greater insulation from special interests.A final caution: \u201cBuy American\u201d has been around for a long time. In fact, it was initiated in 1933, on the last day of Herbert Hoover\u2019s term in office, responding to a \u201cBuy British\u201d plan announced in London. The result of these kinds of moves sent the world into a downward spiral of protectionism and nationalism, impoverishing ordinary people, and creating a dangerous international climate.

That\u2019s a question posed by Deutsche Bank, which noted that S&P Global Ratings has Hong Kong three notches above China while Moody\u2019s and Fitch have Hong Kong one notch higher. The risk is that China\u2019s own rating gets lowered in coming years and drags Hong Kong\u2019s down with it.

According to the Congressional Research Service, the largest U.S. trade surplus in 2019 was with Hong Kong \u2014 $36 billion. Hong Kong counted 278 U.S. companies with regional headquarters in the city that year and another 457 with offices. Hong Kong\u2019s first justice minister after the handover to China in 1997, Elsie Leung, told the South China Morning Post in May that any damage would be mutual: \u201cWe are not just getting the benefits \u2013 it\u2019s a free-trade arrangement which is good for both sides.\u201d6. How has China responded?ADADThe Foreign Ministry has promised unspecified retaliation against what it terms foreign interference, insisting Hong Kong is purely an internal affair. China said last year it would sanction some U.S.-based activist groups including the National Endowment for Democracy, Human Rights Watch and Freedom House, and suspend port visits by U.S. Navy ships to Hong Kong. The official Xinhua News Agency has dismissed as \u201cgroundless\u201d accusations about the loss of freedom or human rights issues in Hong Kong. It also noted that the 2018 Human Freedom Index compiled by the Fraser Institute, a Vancouver-based think tank, ranked Hong Kong at No. 3, well ahead of the U.S. at No. 17.7.

Drezner", "content": "About a year ago I was hard at work on a paper that eventually appeared in the Washington Quarterly evaluating the Trump administration\u2019s record on economic statecraft. It was pretty unsparing:First, the administration\u2019s use of economic diplomacy to secure economic concessions has achieved surprisingly little, and there is no reason to expect a better record in the future. Second, the administration\u2019s maximum pressure campaigns have succeeded at imposing costs on targets but have not led to better bargains. Third, the administration has hamstrung many of its efforts through basic errors of diplomacy. A statecraft gap is emerging between the United States and the other great powers capable of playing this game; simply put, the United States is getting worse at economic diplomacy just as other countries are learning how to adroitly wield economic instruments.I am an academic, which means I also wrote in the conclusion that \u201cit is certainly possible that, a year or two from now, this record might look better.\u201d In the technocratic spirit of updating one\u2019s assessments as the data changes, let\u2019s take a look at the administration\u2019s myriad efforts at economic statecraft to see whether the record has improved or worsened.Support our journalism. Subscribe today.arrow-rightLet\u2019s start where I was wrong. There are two areas where economic statecraft has generated greater returns than what appeared to be true in 2019. The first is that President Trump\u2019s tariff threats unambiguously altered Mexican behavior toward Central American migrants. As Politico\u2019s Sabrina Rodriguez reports:ADADTrump succeeded in using the threat of tariffs to ensure Mexico would deploy its National Guard, which was created to fight crime and restore public safety, along Mexico\u2019s southern border to stop Central American migrants from traveling north to seek asylum in the United States. [Mexican President Andr\u00e9s Manuel] L\u00f3pez Obrador also agreed to allow asylum seekers to remain in Mexico while they wait for their court hearings in the U.S.Indeed, the most underreported foreign policy success of this administration has been the appeasement strategy of L\u00f3pez Obrador, a longtime leftist politician who had railed against Trump\u2019s invective just a few years ago.Rodriguez suggests Mexico\u2019s pliancy is due to shared populism between Trump and AMLO. That is possible, except as the Politico story notes his non-populist predecessor Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto pursued the exact same appeasement strategy.The likelier explanation is that Mexico\u2019s asymmetric dependency on the U.S. market gives the U.S. considerable bargaining leverage, and AMLO is preempting the use of that leverage. This has made Trump very happy, and justifiably so given what his Mexican counterpart has delivered.ADAnother area where U.S. pressure has yielded improved results has been the effort to prevent Huawei and ZTE from playing a role in the construction of 5G networks in allied countries. Last year, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo went on a road show to pressure U.S. allies to block Huawei. Allies remain unconvinced, and even the United Kingdom had made a decision in January to allow Huawei to play a role.ADThat said, transatlantic concern about China has been on the rise. In recent weeks U.S. partners have changed their tune. Singapore announced last month it would limit Huawei to noncore elements of its 5G networks.The bigger move came Tuesday, however, when the United Kingdom reversed course and banned telecom companies from procuring new Huawei equipment. U.S. sanctions played a key role. CNN\u2019s Hadas Gold reported, \u201cDigital and Culture Minister Oliver Dowden said new US sanctions imposed on the company in May had \u2018significantly changed\u2019 the landscape.\u201d The Wall Street Journal\u2019s Stephen Fidler and Max Colchester characterize it as \u201ca sharp about-face that marks a significant victory for the U.S.\u201d and they ain\u2019t wrong.ADSo, in 2020 U.S. economic pressure has yielded more positive results from allies and partners. This was an area where the Trump administration had badly underperformed compared to theoretical expectations, so it deserves credit for a genuine increase in target concessions.ADOn the other hand, when one looks at the administration\u2019s \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d campaigns, a different picture emerges. From North Korea to Iran to China, the outcome has worsened in the past year.The idea of progress in North Korea had always been a mirage, but Pyongyang has been more explicit about that in recent weeks. Slate\u2019s Fred Kaplan noted Monday, \u201ceven that the deal Kim offered at last year\u2019s summit with President Donald Trump in Hanoi, Vietnam \u2014 to shut down one nuclear reactor in exchange for the lifting of all U.S. sanctions since 2016 \u2014 is now off the table.\u201d It might be North Korea\u2019s leadership is hoping a desperate Trump will accede to any deal in the middle of a campaign. The point, however, is despite a parlous economic situation, North Korea is not conceding anything.ADAs for Iran, even high-ranking Trump administration officials are unwittingly admitting failure. In a Monday op-ed, national security adviser and permanent D-lister Robert O\u2019Brien wrote, \u201cin May 2018, Trump pulled our nation out of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, another one-sided agreement that failed to block Iranian nuclear ambitions. Iran is now closer than ever to enriching enough uranium for a nuclear device and has spent the past six years expanding its ballistic-missile program.\u201d As the head of the International Crisis Group tweeted, \u201cthis is a damning indictment of the Trump administration\u2019s Iran policy \u2014 not of the JCPOA.\u201dADThe U.S. maximum-pressure campaign has also pushed Iran closer to China. The New York Times\u2019 Farnaz Fassihi and Steven Lee Myers reported on a new partnership agreement between the two countries:Iran and China have quietly drafted a sweeping economic and security partnership that would clear the way for billions of dollars of Chinese investments in energy and other sectors, undercutting the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to isolate the Iranian government because of its nuclear and military ambitions.The partnership, detailed in an 18-page proposed agreement... would vastly expand Chinese presence in banking, telecommunications, ports, railways and dozens of other projects. In exchange, China would receive a regular \u2014 and, according to an Iranian official and an oil trader, heavily discounted \u2014 supply of Iranian oil over the next 25 years.The document also describes deepening military cooperation, potentially giving China a foothold in a region that has been a strategic preoccupation of the United States for decades. It calls for joint training and exercises, joint research and weapons development and intelligence sharing \u2014 all to fight \u201cthe lopsided battle with terrorism, drug and human trafficking and cross-border crimes.\u201d...It represents a major blow to the Trump administration\u2019s aggressive policy toward Iran since abandoning the nuclear deal reached in 2015 by President Barack Obama and the leaders of six other nations after two years of grueling negotiations.China has excelled over the last decade in driving hard bargains with countries facing U.S. sanctions. This is of a piece with those deals, which helps to explain domestic nationalist blowback in Tehran to the agreement. Furthermore, the details remain fuzzy, much like the initial Russia-China energy deals after the annexation for Crimea. Still, that alliance has proved more durable than many in Washington expected, so attention should be paid to this.ADSo over the past year the Trump administration has cadged greater concessions from allies but faces a worsening strategic situation with adversaries. That track record resembles more past administrations a bit more than in 2019, although the overall record is still quite underwhelming.ADThere is one way, however, in which the Trump administration\u2019s efforts at economic statecraft have been an unmitigated disaster. Contrary to what they expected, their multiple trade wars have not yielded better trade deals. Instead, as Politico\u2019s Ryan McCrimmon observes, the Trump administration has converted globally competitive sectors into rent-seekers:Government payments to farmers have surged to historic levels under President Donald Trump as the Agriculture Department floods the industry with cash to stem the financial losses from Trump\u2019s tariff fights and the coronavirus pandemic.But as agriculture grows more reliant on unprecedented taxpayer support, farm policy experts and watchdog groups warn the subsidies are growing too big and too fast, with no strings attached and little oversight from Congress \u2014 and that Washington could have a difficult time shutting off the spigot.Direct farm aid has climbed each year of Trump\u2019s presidency, from $11.5 billion in 2017 to more than $32 billion this year \u2014 an all-time high, with potentially far more funding still to come in 2020, amounting to about two-thirds of the cost of the entire Department of Housing and Urban Development and more than the Agriculture Department\u2019s $24 billion discretionary budget.Social scientists have long been aware that economic sanctions and trade wars can inculcate sectors with a vested interest in protection. The Trump administration\u2019s trade wars have been so wide-ranging, however, that it has succeeded in converting outward-facing business sectors into subsidy addicts. The result has been a few more concessions from allies, a worsening strategic situation, an industrial recession, and an agricultural sector addicted to corporate welfare.Not great, Donald.", "comment": "0 Comments", "topic": "PostEverything"}, {"cover": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/SZ6BCHGFIAI6VKBFQ4RAATSBKA.jpghttps://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/SZ6BCHGFIAI6VKBFQ4RAATSBKA.jpg", "title": "Trump\u2019 two main foreign foes plan a major pact", "date": "Jul 14, 2020", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2020/07/14/trump-china-iran-pact/", "keyword": "U.S.-China trade and tariffs", "website": "the Washington Post", "author": "Ishaan Tharoor", "content": "Want smart analysis of the most important news in your inbox every weekday, along with other global reads, interesting ideas and opinions to know?

And recent developments suggest these two putative American adversaries may be finding greater common cause.Support our journalism. Subscribe today.arrow-rightLast week, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif acknowledged in a parliamentary session that his government is, \u201cwith confidence and conviction,\u201d in negotiations with China over a 25-year strategic partnership that could involve about $400 billion in Chinese investment through various sectors of the Iranian economy. An outline of the accord\u2019s details surfaced in an 18-page leaked document online, whose provenance is unclear though it roughly aligns with mooted plans previously announced by the Iranian government. According to the New York Times, a version of the document dated in June that its reporters obtained is a draft of a pending agreement with China.ADADThe pact between the two countries would be far-reaching: It would increase intelligence sharing and security cooperation, including in possible missions in Syria and Iraq. It would also see Chinese companies expand their footprints in Iranian railroads, ports and telecommunications, while securing for Beijing a steady and discounted Iranian oil supply for the next quarter-century. China would develop free-trade zones in strategic locations in Iran, further binding the country into Beijing\u2019s sprawling Belt and Road global trade and development initiative.Even though it has been in the works since 2016, before Trump was elected, the timing of this potential agreement is conspicuous. It\u2019s a reminder of how unlikely it was that Trump could cajole Tehran to sit down for new negotiations after scrapping U.S. commitments to the nuclear deal, a diplomatic agreement that was years in the making and involved the efforts of major powers, including China. Now, with their economy in tatters, the Iranians are seeking a lifeline from Beijing. And Chinese officials, given their own tussle with Washington, seem willing to take the risk.\u201cAt a time when the United States is reeling from recession and the coronavirus, and increasingly isolated internationally, Beijing senses American weakness,\u201d wrote Times reporters Farnaz Fassihi and Steven Lee Myers. \u201cThe draft agreement with Iran shows that unlike most countries, China feels it is in a position to defy the United States, powerful enough to withstand American penalties, as it has in the trade war waged by President Trump.\u201dADADIt is unclear when an actual deal will get pushed through. When asked about it by reporters last week, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian offered a customarily anodyne response. \u201cChina and Iran enjoy traditional friendship, and the two sides have been in communication on the development of bilateral relations,\u201d he said. \u201cWe stand ready to work with Iran to steadily advance practical cooperation.\u201dChina is also playing a key role at the U.N. Security Council in blocking the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to extend an arms embargo on Iran that is set to expire later this year. Last month, China\u2019s ambassador to the United Nations, Zhang Jun, rebuffed U.S. attempts to use the terms of the nuclear deal to reimpose the weapons ban, scolding the Trump administration for not holding up its end of the bargain in the first place.Some analysts abroad saw hypocrisy in Tehran\u2019s courtship of Beijing. \u201cAn Iranian regime whose revolutionary identity is premised on countering U.S. imperialism and Islamophobia is about to ratify its total economic and strategic dependency on a Chinese government that keeps over 1 million Muslims in re-education camps,\u201d tweeted Karim Sadjadpour, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.Within Iran, the matter is hardly settled. It will require a vote in a parliament now dominated by hard-liners who are already furious with President Hassan Rouhani over both his handling of the coronavirus pandemic and the failure of the nuclear deal. Rouhani\u2019s signature diplomatic triumph has effectively turned to ash, with his country\u2019s economy asphyxiated by U.S. sanctions once more and the prospect of an opening to the West seemingly dashed.ADADBut Iran\u2019s turn toward countries like Russia and China has raised concerns about the inequitable price it may have to pay. Last month, former president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad warned in a speech of the country\u2019s current leadership discussing a monumental pact \u201caway from the eyes of the Iranian nation.\u201d Some critics, reported Radio Free Europe/Radio Free Liberty\u2019s Golnaz Esfandiari, likened the proposed deal to \u201cthe 1828 Treaty of Turkmenchay between Persia and tsarist Russia, under which the Persians ceded control of territory in the South Caucasus.\u201dZarif said there was \u201cnothing secret\u201d about the ongoing negotiations, and media outlets linked to the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps \u2014 an occasional political adversary of Rouhani and Zarif \u2014 seemed to back the diplomatic process. \u201cHowever, neither Zarif nor IRGC mouthpieces openly admitted why the Islamic Republic is compelled to orient itself toward China,\u201d wrote Ali Alfoneh, a senior fellow at the Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington. \u201cIn the face of the U.S. administration\u2019s \u2018maximum pressure\u2019 campaign, the Islamic Republic is turning toward China to secure its survival.\u201dRead more: The trouble with making Hagia Sophia a mosque againThe pandemic and the dawn of an \u2018Asian Century\u2019Trump hosts Mexico\u2019s president, an unlikely ally", "comment": "191 Comments", "topic": "Today's WorldView"}, {"cover": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/DLWGARWAXYI6VCIINCRLT2XJ4A.jpghttps://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/DLWGARWAXYI6VCIINCRLT2XJ4A.jpg", "title": "What the Hong Kong Dollar Peg Is and Why It Matters", "date": "Jul 13, 2020", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/what-the-hong-kong-dollar-peg-is-and-why-it-matters/2020/07/07/1baadc1a-c0be-11ea-8908-68a2b9eae9e0_story.html", "keyword": "U.S.-China trade and tariffs", "website": "the Washington Post", "author": "", "content": "Pegged to the U.S. dollar since 1983, the Hong Kong dollar is usually a dull currency. Except when it isn\u2019t. Heightened tension between the U.S. and China over the city\u2019s autonomy has focused attention on it yet again.Support our journalism. Subscribe today.arrow-right1. How does it work?The Hong Kong Monetary Authority, the de-facto central bank, has a mandate to keep the currency trading at HK$7.75 to HK$7.85 per U.S. dollar. The current band was set in 2005 and has never been broken, although it\u2019s often tested. When it gets too close to one end or the other, the HKMA intervenes, either by buying or selling the city\u2019s dollars.2. Why does keeping the peg matter?First and foremost, the currency peg is considered an anchor for financial stability and the economy. Investors park their money in Hong Kong because the currency is relatively safe and easily convertible -- one of the reasons the city became a global financial center in the first place. Breaking the peg would upset that whole equation.ADAD3. What\u2019s the threat?It\u2019s politics. After China in May said it would impose new national security legislation on Hong Kong, the Trump administration said the city was no longer sufficiently autonomous from the mainland to warrant the \u201cspecial status\u201d granted by the U.S. for trading purposes. The opening salvo from the U.S. included visa restrictions and a suspension of some export license exceptions, and more far-reaching measures could follow, such as on tariffs. The current arrangement also allows for U.S. dollars to be freely exchanged with Hong Kong dollars, which if revoked would amount to what often gets called the \u201cnuclear option.\u201d4. Why is that?ADIf the Trump administration were to limit the HKMA\u2019s access to U.S. dollars, that could hamper the city\u2019s ability to defend its currency tie to the greenback. Such an extreme move would likely prompt people to pull money out of Hong Kong, putting even more pressure on the currency. (Unlike mainland China, where capital flows are tightly controlled, Hong Kong allows money to flow in and out unrestricted.) Fortunes big and small could be lost if the currency collapsed.AD5. What are the chances?Bloomberg News reported in July that the idea of striking against the Hong Kong dollar peg -- perhaps by limiting the ability of Hong Kong banks to buy U.S. dollars -- had been raised as part of broader discussions among advisers to Secretary of State Michael Pompeo, but that it also faces strong opposition from others in the administration who worry such a move would only hurt Hong Kong banks and the U.S., not China. Previously, Eddie Yue, chief executive of the HKMA, had described the idea an \u201capocalyptic\u201d scenario that could backfire on Trump. \u201cWith Hong Kong\u2019s financial system closely integrated with the global economic and financial systems, any move that hits our financial system would also send shock waves across the global financial markets, including the U.S.,\u201d he said. \u201cConfidence of international investors in using the USD and holding U.S. financial assets could also be undermined.\u201dAD6. Are people worried?ADThere is little sign of it yet. The currency is trading at the strong end of its band, as impending public stock offerings boost demand for Hong Kong dollars. Bank deposits in Hong Kong increased 0.8% in April from the previous month, the biggest gain in six months. Sustained periods of outflows have occurred during previous bouts of stress such as the global financial crisis and SARS epidemic, and when the U.S. Federal Reserve was raising interest rates. The fear arose again last year as political upheaval roiled the city, though ultimately capital flows remained broadly stable.7. Should they be?Officials in Hong Kong say no. The HKMA has more than $430 billion of foreign reserves itself. China\u2019s central bank also can provide U.S. dollars through a currency swap line should Washington impose sanctions on the city, said Financial Secretary Paul Chan. China has the world\u2019s largest foreign-exchange reserves at more than $3 trillion.ADAD8. Could Hong Kong just peg its dollar to the Chinese yuan instead?The HKMA says no. For the time being, the U.S. dollar is the \u201cmost appropriate anchor currency\u201d because it is fully convertible and can be traded freely in large amounts on foreign exchange markets. The yuan doesn\u2019t fit that bill. The U.S. dollar also functions as an international reserve currency and the Fed has a good record of fostering price stability. In addition, Hong Kong\u2019s business cycles are \u201cstill more synchronized\u201d with the U.S. than mainland China, it says.9. What usually moves the Hong Kong dollar?Often it\u2019s interest rates, especially when local ones don\u2019t move in tandem with the U.S. For example, when interbank rates on the Hong Kong dollar -- known as Hibor -- remain elevated as the Fed reduces borrowing costs, it becomes more attractive for investors to buy the Hong Kong currency against the greenback. The gap between Hibor and the U.S. currency\u2019s Libor has been around the widest since 1999 since March, helping to push the Hong Kong dollar to HK$7.75 for the first time since early 2016. That prompted the HKMA in April to sell the city\u2019s dollars to prevent a break of the peg.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P.", "comment": "0 Comments", "topic": "Business"}, {"cover": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/YBYUKLWC2MI6VCIINCRLT2XJ4A.jpghttps://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/YBYUKLWC2MI6VCIINCRLT2XJ4A.jpg", "title": "Who Will Lead the WTO and Help It Avoid Collapse?", "date": "Jul 11, 2020", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/who-will-lead-the-wto-and-help-it-avoid-collapse/2020/07/10/c2676476-c2d3-11ea-8908-68a2b9eae9e0_story.html", "keyword": "U.S.-China trade and tariffs", "website": "the Washington Post", "author": "", "content": "The campaign to lead the World Trade Organization during the most turbulent period of its 25-year existence has officially begun.

If members can align behind a candidate committed to modernization, it could break bureaucratic logjams and help unleash a wave of global growth at a time when it is needed most. If no such candidate can be found, the WTO risks further receding into irrelevance.ADAD2. What\u2019s precipitated the crisis?The WTO\u2019s appellate body, the main forum for settling worldwide trade disagreements, lost its ability in December 2019 to rule on new dispute cases. That resulted from a U.S. refusal over the previous two years to consider any nominees to fill vacancies on the panel. WTO members can still bring disputes to the trade body and receive an initial ruling, but that can be appealed into legal limbo. The U.S. imposition of hundreds of billions of dollars worth of tariffs against China, and use of the WTO\u2019s national security loophole to levy duties on steel and aluminum, have also weakened the organization.3. What is the WTO\u2019s selection process?ADThe chairman of the WTO General Council launched a selection procedure in June to confirm the trade body\u2019s next director-general. WTO members had sought to truncate the six-month process into just three in order to avoid a leadership vacuum in September, but it\u2019s likely a new candidate won\u2019t be selected until after the U.S. presidential election in November. During this time, the candidates will present themselves to the WTO\u2019s membership, campaign for support and sit for a question-and-answer session with the WTO General Council. Then the WTO\u2019s three highest-ranking delegates, known as \u201cthe troika,\u201d will consult with the membership and try to build a consensus around a final candidate.AD4.

What kind of leader are nations looking for?Governments hope the next WTO director-general can persuade members to complete the much-needed reform of the organization. Trade officials in Geneva broadly argue that Azevedo\u2019s successor should have sufficient leadership authority and capability to marshal broad support around the WTO\u2019s reform agenda. That means strong consideration should be given to candidates who have, at the very least, some experience as a minister.7. Is there a nationality requirement?No. However, trade officials from the U.S., EU and Canada say the next WTO director-general should come from a developed country due to their belief that the organization\u2019s leadership should rotate between developed and developing countries. Not all delegates agree on this, however, and representatives from African nations argue that it\u2019s their continent\u2019s turn to take on the top mantle of the WTO.ADAD8. Should a woman lead the WTO?There is a strong push among Geneva trade delegates to select a woman to lead the WTO for the first time. However, free-trade advocates like Wendy Cutler, vice president of the Washington-based Asia Society Policy Institute, argue that WTO members should try to avoid placing gender constraints on the selection process.9. Are there any other considerations?The candidate must also thread a narrow diplomatic needle that displeases neither the U.S. nor China, whose bitter conflict over the pandemic is testing their fragile economic truce. The Trump administration has actively sought to undermine the WTO\u2019s ability to function, saying it has infringed on American sovereignty and enabled China to become a big economic player globally at the expense of U.S. jobs and manufacturing. Adding to the unpredictability factor, President Donald Trump -- who has called the WTO the worst trade deal the U.S. has ever signed -- is up for re-election in November, so America\u2019s tolerance for a candidate who looks too favorably on China might be tested. Meanwhile, China has engaged in a multi-year campaign to expand its diplomatic influence by installing key personnel at the top levels of international decision making bodies.10.

Subscribe today.arrow-rightInfluential posts linked to the movement, which emerged from the fringes of the Internet a few years ago, have touted conspiracy theories about the pandemic and other public events and have been promoted online by President Trump.Other Silicon Valley companies, including Facebook and YouTube, said they were also considering crackdowns on the movement, some of whom are the president\u2019s most extreme supporters.Twitter said late Tuesday that it had banned 7,000 QAnon accounts for violating its policies, including by organizing harassment of other users or trying to get around an earlier suspension. The social media company has also limited the reach of QAnon-related accounts by no longer surfacing the accounts as recommendations, not highlighting them in search and blocking QAnon-related URLs from being shared. The action against QAnon, which will affect about 150,000 accounts, means Twitter will de-emphasize the group as a whole as the company works to cut off the rampant spread of conspiracy theories on its site.ADAD\u201cWe\u2019ve been clear that we will take strong enforcement action on behavior that has the potential to lead to offline harm,\u201d the company\u2019s safety team wrote in a tweet. \u201cIn line with this approach, this week we are taking further action on so-called \u2018QAnon\u2019 activity across the service.\u201d News of Twitter\u2019s crackdown was earlier reported by NBC News.Twitter, along with other social media sites, has become a breeding ground for conspiracy theories. Supporters spread misinformation, coordinate harassment against public figures, and organize real-life protests. Their activity reached a fever pitch during the first months of the coronavirus pandemic when some protests calling for businesses to reopen were tied to members of darker Internet subcultures, including QAnon believers.A flood of misinformation about the novel coronavirus pushed Twitter, Facebook and YouTube to instate new policies and refer people searching for information to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But they\u2019ve struggled to keep up with groups like QAnon. ADADFor example, in May the QAnon-focused groups on Facebook were influential in spreading the \u201cPlandemic\u201d documentary that falsely claimed billionaires intentionally helped spread coronavirus, according to social media researcher Erin Gallagher. The video was viewed by millions of people before the companies cut it off.QAnon accounts have become even more prominent in spreading Twitter misinformation during the pandemic, University of Washington professor Kate Starbird said about the crackdown.The impact of Twitter\u2019s decision will likely be somewhat mixed, she said. It might fuel the conspiracy theory followers to rally together and cry censorship, but it will also mean that the harmful and misleading content will be harder to find, making it tougher to recruit new members.AD\u201cRemoving some of the inorganic activity and just dampening, limiting the visibility of their activity, can perhaps make a dent in some of the misinformation flows we\u2019ve been seeing,\u201d Starbird said.ADSome of the QAnon accounts are big influencers with hundreds of thousands of followers, she said. More are just everyday users who may follow a few thousand accounts but have far fewer followers themselves.Twitter\u2019s move will also serve as an example for other social media companies considering taking their own action against the group, she said.Protests spread, fueled by economic woes and Internet subculturesA person familiar with Facebook\u2019s thinking, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the plan is not yet public, confirmed reporting in the New York Times that Facebook also plans to limit the reach of QAnon related posts.ADYouTube spokesperson Farshad Shadloo said the video streaming site is also working to reduce the spread of QAnon videos as part of its push not to amplify what it calls \u201cborderline\u201d content. That policy allows videos to remain online while not being recommended widely.ADThe baseless QAnon theory is rooted in the belief that Trump is working to weed out a network of sexual predators that hold positions of power in the political world and Hollywood. Followers look for posts pushing the theory from an anonymous figure known as Q. The theory has ties to the Pizzagate theory, which spread false beliefs about Hillary Clinton, a group of sex offenders and a pizza shop in 2016.QAnon groups have been highly active in supporting Trump and in pushing ideas in his direction. On Mother\u2019s Day weekend this year, the president retweeted accounts that promoted the QAnon conspiracy theory about Democratic involvement in a pedophilia cult. QAnon accounts were also major promoters of the anti-malaria drug hydroxychlororquine that was touted repeatedly by the president as a treatment for the coronavirus. The drug has been shown to be no better than a placebo in patients who were not hospitalized.ADTwitter is not the first platform to take action against QAnon. In 2018, Reddit banned /r/GreatAwakening, its largest community affiliated with the group, after saying that the group broke its rules against promoting violence.ADFor years, however, tech platforms have enabled the growth of QAnon because social media companies do not ban misinformation. For the first time this year, the companies have prohibited misinformation related to the coronavirus and voting.Facebook and other companies are removing viral \u2018Plandemic\u2019 conspiracy videoOnline accounts associated with the QAnon conspiracy theory have played a significant role in spreading misinformation about major public events, including the pandemic. They were also affiliated with the ReOpen movement that encouraged Americans to protest the lockdowns.ADTwitter has been taking a leading position in better policing tweets that violate its policies in the lead-up to the election, including by slapping warning labels on five of Trump\u2019s tweets. Facebook said last month it would follow suit, to a certain extent, and label some posts from public officials that violated its policies but that it deemed newsworthy enough to keep online.QAnon\u2019s hold in the offline world, bolstered by the reopening protests, has moved into the political realm.

Subscribe today.arrow-rightIn one of his most far-reaching plans since emerging as the presumptive Democratic nominee, Biden called for the federal government to spend $400 billion over four years on materials and services made in the United States, as well as $300 billion on U.S.-based research and development involving electric cars, artificial intelligence and similar technologies.He also advocated a 100-day \u201csupply chain review\u201d that could require federal agencies to buy only medical supplies and other goods manufactured in the United States. And he urged an end to loopholes that let procurement officers and federal contractors get around  existing \u201cBuy American\u201d clauses.ADAD\u201cWhen we spend taxpayers\u2019 money \u2014 when the federal government spends taxpayers\u2019 money \u2014 we should use it to buy American products and support American jobs,\u201d Biden said in a speech at a metal works plant in Dunmore in Pennsylvania, a crucial battleground state.The announcement marked an effort by Biden to begin laying out his agenda in more detail after months in which his central message was Trump\u2019s failures. It also amounted to a recognition that while Trump trails in the polls, many voters support his handling of the economy.The president has been arguing for months that the economy will regain its momentum when business, restaurants and other operations are allowed to reopen. Some Trump allies were frustrated Thursday that Biden offered his plan before the president announced a similar \u201cBuy American\u201d proposal that officials say has been held up for months amid internal White House objections.ADAD\u201cThey are essentially trying to steal the Trump program of 2016 and steal that playbook,\u201d Trump\u2019s former chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon said on his radio program. \u201cFor some reason, the White House and the campaign have been caught flat-footed. Biden has very smart people around him, particularly on the economic side.\u201dBiden\u2019s pitch underscores a striking shift in both parties away from globalization and free trade and toward protecting American workers and revitalizing struggling domestic industries. Those trends have been accelerated by the coronavirus pandemic, which has wreaked havoc on the economy.Biden said Thursday that his plan would restore the jobs lost this year and create 5 million new ones. It amounted to the most forceful case he has made for reducing dependence on foreign countries to supply the United States with essential goods.ADADBiden repeatedly castigated Trump and sounded populist notes that were reminiscent of his more liberal primary challengers. He stressed the need to protect workers and Main Street rather than the \u201cwealthy investor class\u201d and \u201cbankers and CEOs.\u201d He declared that \u201cenough is enough,\u201d saying it is \u201ctime to reverse the priorities in this country. It\u2019s time to help small businesses, middle-class folks, manage their way through the pandemic.\u201dTrump\u2019s rise in 2016 was built heavily on promises of bringing back American jobs, as well as blaming immigrants for hurting American workers. As president, he has stoked a trade war with China and imposed tariffs that flew in the face of his party\u2019s orthodoxy.Vice President Pence was also in Pennsylvania on Thursday, touting Trump\u2019s economic performance in a talk to business leaders in the borough of Malvern near Philadelphia. While 22 million jobs have been lost during the pandemic, the country has regained 7 million of them, Pence said.ADADWe see \u201cthis country coming back because of the solid foundation that was put in place\u201d by the Trump administration, Pence said, including lower taxes, less regulation, more U.S.-produced energy and better trade agreements. He called it \u201cthe great American comeback.\u201dStill, Trump\u2019s efforts to revive domestic manufacturing produced uneven results even before the pandemic. There were fewer manufacturing workers in Wisconsin this January than there were at any point under the Bush administration, for example.Biden, who once supported the North American Free Trade Agreement and Trans-Pacific Partnership, has in contrast focused his current campaign on prioritizing American industries, following the lead of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), the democratic socialist who was his top rival for the Democratic nomination, and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who released a  \u201cPlan For Economic Patriotism\u201d during the primary and has undergone vetting by Biden\u2019s campaign to be his running mate.ADADBiden and Warren\u2019s teams consulted closely on the new plan, according to two people with knowledge of the situation, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe private talks.The plan won some praise Thursday from liberal leaders. \u201cAll in all, on the right track,\u201d Columbia University economics professor Jeffrey Sachs wrote in an email to The Post. Sachs supported Sanders for president and now backs Biden.Biden\u2019s new platform focuses heavily on using the power of the federal government to promote a U.S. domestic manufacturing base. The $400 billion procurement initiative would be spread over four years to spur demand for American products and services, as would the $300 billion investment in research and breakthrough technologies. Half of the $300 billion would go to clean-energy initiatives and were previously announced.ADADBefore Biden spoke Thursday, he toured the metal works plant with Sen. Robert P. Casey Jr. (D-Pa.) and plant owner Robert McGregor.\u201cHow are you, man?\u201d Biden asked a worker. \u201cI keep distance,\u201d the worker said. Biden wore a mask throughout the tour.Later he delivered his remarks outside at a covered loading dock. It started raining, and Biden invited attendees to seek shelter under the covering as the water loudly pelted the steel roof. Some workers took him up on his offer.Circles were placed in front of Biden\u2019s lectern to encourage listeners to stay within them and maintain social distancing. Reporters had their temperatures taken and were asked coronavirus screening questions as they entered.ADBiden broadened his argument against Trump beyond the economy, criticizing his defense of Confederate symbols, which has been the subject of ongoing debate in the presidential race. Trump is \u201cdetermined to drive us apart to keep his base in place,\u201d the former vice president said.ADHolding a significant lead in the polls, Biden is seeking to close off any possible openings for Trump to make the contest more competitive. He said he plans to unveil proposals next week on infrastructure and clean energy, the second part of what he bills as the \u201cBuild Back Better\u201d plan. The other two components are caregiving and education, and racial equality.Both campaigns are gearing up for an escalating clash over the economy, a normally dominant theme in presidential elections. Trump argues that he built a booming economy before the coronavirus outbreak and could do it again. Biden blames Trump for his erratic reaction to the pandemic and frequent flouting of public health advice, which he says fueled the alarming rate of infections and badly damaged the economy as a result.ADOn the Republican side, White House advisers and allies worried about Biden\u2019s \u201cBuy American\u201d push, with Bannon saying on his radio program that the Democrat\u2019s rollout could help him in such states as Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, which Trump narrowly won in major 2016 upsets.ADTrump aides said the president remains the obvious person to reignite the economy as he has done before.\u201cPresident Trump\u2019s policies of lower taxes, deregulation, reciprocal trade and energy independence built a booming economy once, and they will do so again under his leadership,\u201d said Judd Deere, a White House spokesman.White House officials led by senior Trump adviser Peter Navarro have drafted an executive order requiring federal agencies to buy medical supplies and pharmaceuticals produced in the United States.That executive order has languished for months, however, amid objections by some of Trump\u2019s other senior advisers, including Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Trump\u2019s son-in-law Jared Kushner, who have warned that it could lead China to limit the supply of personal protective equipment, or PPE, that it is sending to the United States.Some analysts said  the executive order could now be signed swiftly, but it remained unclear Thursday when or whether that would happen.When it comes to Biden\u2019s plan, the Democrat\u2019s campaign says he will finance the ongoing costs of his economic agenda by reversing some of Trump\u2019s tax cuts for corporations and imposing \u201ccommon-sense tax reforms that finally make sure the wealthiest Americans pay their fair share.\u201d The campaign declined to provide a more detailed accounting of how it would pay for the $700 billion in spending it  proposed Thursday.A senior Biden campaign official said more specific details would be released once the full plan is out, speaking on the condition of anonymity because the campaign did not authorize the person to speak on the record. Those details would include a stimulus package, which Biden believes will be needed, and continuing costs, the official said.Biden often touts his central role in the Obama administration, but he has been less eager to tout the administration\u2019s championing of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), which proved controversial with the party\u2019s union base. Labor leaders said it did too little to require America\u2019s partners improve their environmental and labor standards.Trump highlighted the shortcomings of the TPP and other trade deals in his 2016 campaign and rejected it upon taking office. Biden has said he wants to renegotiate the agreement, which includes several Asian countries and which supporters say could serve as a bulwark against China\u2019s influence. Thursday\u2019s plan calls for using tax dollars to \u201cstand up to the Chinese government\u2019s abuses, insist on fair trade, and extend opportunity to all Americans.\u201d\u201cTrade negotiations over big trade deals is something that in sequence will follow a dramatic set of domestic investments,\u201d said the senior Biden campaign official. In addition to closing loopholes around existing \u201cBuy American\u201d clauses, Biden is pushing for a crackdown on false advertising of \u201cBuy American\u201d goods.Since the end of the Obama administration, many Democrats have backed off the TPP and focused instead on directly promoting domestic production. Bipartisan momentum has grown in recent weeks for tax incentives for companies to onshore their supply chains, in part because of the gaps in U.S. medical supply production exposed by the pandemic.The nation is facing a new shortage of personal protective equipment, including of N95 masks and medical gowns, as cases rise. But bringing supply chains back to the United States could prove difficult, and the Trump administration has struggled to do so.A Biden administration, like the Trump White House, would face the prospect of foreign retaliation for any promotion of American companies. \u201cBuy American\u201d provisions are also likely to face objections from U.S. firms that would see their costs increase if forced to buy more expensive supplies. Senior Biden officials said Wednesday that their plans were carefully vetted and do not run afoul of World Trade Organization rules.\u201cIncentivizing companies to raise their costs by \u2018Buying American\u2019 is not going to fix almost two decades of low productivity growth \u2014 it\u2019s going to take us in the opposite direction,\u201d said Adam Ozimek, chief economist at Upwork. \u201cThis will just create higher costs for American businesses and consumers.\u201d\n\n\n\n", "comment": "0 Comments", "topic": "Politics"}, {"cover": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/Q4PKVNV45MI6VF6BNTYRN77CNQ.jpghttps://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/Q4PKVNV45MI6VF6BNTYRN77CNQ.jpg", "title": "What Hong Kong Losing Its \u2018Special Status\u2019 Would Mean", "date": "Jul 5, 2020", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/what-hong-kong-losing-its-special-status-would-mean/2020/07/03/8807e65e-bceb-11ea-97c1-6cf116ffe26c_story.html", "keyword": "U.S.-China trade and tariffs", "website": "the Washington Post", "author": "", "content": "Under the United States-Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992, the U.S. treats Hong Kong, a semi-autonomous part of China with its own legal and economic system, differently than the Chinese mainland in trade, commerce and other areas.

Hurting China also carries additional risks for the U.S. economy, including the U.S.-China trade deal that Trump had considered one of his biggest achievements, which could affect his odds of winning re-election.

What\u2019s at stake for Hong Kong and China?While Hong Kong remains a key gateway from China to the rest of the world, it matters far less to the country\u2019s fortunes than it once did. In 2019, 12% of China\u2019s exports went to or through Hong Kong, down from 45% in 1992. China is also far less reliant on inflows of foreign capital and expertise, and has made a much lower priority of making the yuan an international currency. Nonetheless, the city still matters. Hong Kong\u2019s open capital account and adherence to international standards of governance are unmatched by any mainland Chinese city and make it an important base for international banks and trading firms. Revoking the special status would be \u201cthe nuclear option\u201d and \u201cthe beginning of the death of Hong Kong as we know it,\u201d said Steve Tsang, director of the University of London\u2019s SOAS China Institute.AD5. And their financial markets?ADOne worst-case scenario: if the U.S. treats Hong Kong no differently than any other Chinese city, why wouldn\u2019t ratings firms and investors do the same? It\u2019s a question posed by Deutsche Bank, which noted that S&P Global Ratings has Hong Kong three notches above China while Moody\u2019s and Fitch have Hong Kong one notch higher. The risk is that China\u2019s own rating gets lowered in coming years and drags Hong Kong\u2019s with it. At the same time, equity index providers may take a fresh look at Hong Kong, which is currently in the MSCI World Index with other developed markets. China is in the emerging market index, raising the question, should Hong Kong be treated the same as Shanghai and Shenzhen?6. What about for the U.S.?ADIt has its own reasons for not rocking the boat too much. Hong Kong, the only semi-democratic jurisdiction under Chinese rule, offers U.S. companies a relatively safe way to access the Chinese market and employs a U.S. dollar peg, linking it with the American financial system. According to the Congressional Research Service, the largest U.S. trade surplus in 2019 was with Hong Kong \u2014 $36 billion. Hong Kong counted 278 U.S. companies with regional headquarters in the city that year and another 457 with offices. Hong Kong\u2019s first justice minister after the handover to China in 1997, Elsie Leung, told the South China Morning Post in May that any damage would be mutual: \u201cWe are not just getting the benefits \u2013 it\u2019s a free-trade arrangement which is good for both sides.\u201dAD7. How has China responded?Despite the U.S. action, Chinese lawmakers approved new national security legislation for Hong Kong anyway. The Foreign Ministry has promised unspecified retaliation against what it terms foreign interference, insisting Hong Kong is purely an internal affair. China said last year it would sanction some U.S.-based activist groups including the National Endowment for Democracy, Human Rights Watch and Freedom House, and suspend port visits by U.S. Navy ships to Hong Kong. The official Xinhua News Agency has dismissed as \u201cgroundless\u201d accusations about the loss of freedom or human rights issues in Hong Kong. It also noted that the 2018 Human Freedom Index compiled by the Fraser Institute, a Vancouver-based think tank, ranked Hong Kong at No. 3, well ahead of the U.S. at No. 17.AD8. And Hong Kong?ADThe city\u2019s leader, Chief Executive Carrie Lam, has defended the national security law (as has Li Ka-shing, Hong Kong\u2019s richest tycoon). Lam also has said it would be \u201ctotally unacceptable\u201d for foreign legislatures to interfere in Hong Kong\u2019s internal affairs, and that sanctions would only complicate the problems in the city. (Lam was selected in 2017 by a committee of 1,200 political insiders overwhelmingly loyal to the Chinese government.) She has sought to reassure investors that the city still adheres to the rule of law and has an independent judiciary. She also has defended police actions.9. Is this what the protesters have been seeking?ADAs a largely leaderless movement, the Hong Kong protests have made no official request for international assistance. But some prominent activists including Jimmy Lai and Joshua Wong called on Trump to hit China hard with sanctions, even to the point of revoking the city\u2019s special trading status. Wong had testified last year in Washington in favor of the bill, seeking to put pressure on China. On the streets of Hong Kong, some protesters have made clear their interest in U.S. support by waving American flags, singing \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner\u201d and calling on Trump to \u201cliberate\u201d Hong Kong. Such rallying cries are now illegal in Hong Kong under the new national security law.(An earlier version corrected the first name of Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross in question 1)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P.", "comment": "0 Comments", "topic": "Business"}, {"cover": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/UWAMJVF37QI6VF6BNTYRN77CNQ.jpghttps://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/UWAMJVF37QI6VF6BNTYRN77CNQ.jpg", "title": "What Hong Kong Losing Its \u2018Special Status\u2019 Would Mean", "date": "Jul 2, 2020", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/what-hong-kong-losing-its-special-status-would-mean/2020/07/01/a6586164-bbfc-11ea-97c1-6cf116ffe26c_story.html", "keyword": "U.S.-China trade and tariffs", "website": "the Washington Post", "author": "", "content": "Under the United States-Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992, the U.S. treats Hong Kong, a semi-autonomous part of China with its own legal and economic system, differently than the Chinese mainland in trade, commerce and other areas.

Hong Kong counted 278 U.S. companies with regional headquarters in the city that year and another 457 with offices. Hong Kong\u2019s first justice minister after the handover to China in 1997, Elsie Leung, told the South China Morning Post in May that any damage would be mutual: \u201cWe are not just getting the benefits \u2013 it\u2019s a free-trade arrangement which is good for both sides.\u201dAD7. How has China responded?Despite the U.S. action, Chinese lawmakers approved new national security legislation for Hong Kong anyway. The Foreign Ministry has promised unspecified retaliation against what it terms foreign interference, insisting Hong Kong is purely an internal affair. China said last year it would sanction some U.S.-based activist groups including the National Endowment for Democracy, Human Rights Watch and Freedom House, and suspend port visits by U.S. Navy ships to Hong Kong. The official Xinhua News Agency has dismissed as \u201cgroundless\u201d accusations about the loss of freedom or human rights issues in Hong Kong. It also noted that the 2018 Human Freedom Index compiled by the Fraser Institute, a Vancouver-based think tank, ranked Hong Kong at No. 3, well ahead of the U.S. at No. 17.AD8. And Hong Kong?ADThe city\u2019s leader, Chief Executive Carrie Lam, has defended the national security law (as has Li Ka-shing, Hong Kong\u2019s richest tycoon). Lam also has said it would be \u201ctotally unacceptable\u201d for foreign legislatures to interfere in Hong Kong\u2019s internal affairs, and that sanctions would only complicate the problems in the city. (Lam was selected in 2017 by a committee of 1,200 political insiders overwhelmingly loyal to the Chinese government.) She has sought to reassure investors that the city still adheres to the rule of law and has an independent judiciary. She also has defended police actions.9. Is this what the protesters have been seeking?ADAs a largely leaderless movement, the Hong Kong protests have made no official request for international assistance. But some prominent activists including Jimmy Lai and Joshua Wong called on Trump to hit China hard with sanctions, even to the point of revoking the city\u2019s special trading status. Wong had testified last year in Washington in favor of the bill, seeking to put pressure on China. On the streets of Hong Kong, some protesters have made clear their interest in U.S. support by waving American flags, singing \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner\u201d and calling on Trump to \u201cliberate\u201d Hong Kong.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P.", "comment": "0 Comments", "topic": "Business"}, {"cover": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/IKG4UOGBJUI6VCIINCRLT2XJ4A.jpghttps://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/IKG4UOGBJUI6VCIINCRLT2XJ4A.jpg", "title": "Joe Biden flips the script on Trump", "date": "Jul 9, 2020", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/07/09/joe-biden-flips-script-trump/", "keyword": "U.S.-China trade and tariffs", "website": "the Washington Post", "author": "Greg Sargent", "content": "In a famous 2016 interview, Stephen K. Bannon declared that incoming President Trump would build an \u201centirely new\u201d movement for the \u201cAmerican working class\u201d built on a \u201cpopulist\u201d agenda of massive spending to rebuild the U.S. manufacturing base.Support our journalism. Subscribe today.arrow-right\u201cIt will be as exciting as the 1930s,\u201d Trump\u2019s former adviser said, suggesting this \u201ceconomic nationalism\u201d would rival the New Deal\u2019s transformation of government\u2019s role in the economy and its realignment of the two parties\u2019 relationship to the working class.Joe Biden is set to introduce a new economic plan on Thursday that may end up flipping this script entirely.The new plan draws a stark contrast with Trump on two fronts \u2014 his failure to mobilize a robust federal response to the coronavirus pandemic, and his full-on embrace of GOP plutocracy, which sold out the Bannon promise.ADADThe core of the Biden plan is a pledge to \u201cuse the full power of the federal government\u201d to \u201crebuild U.S. domestic manufacturing capacity\u201d and fortify \u201csupply chains\u201d to ensure availability of \u201ccritical supplies\u201d in \u201cfuture crises.\u201dIt envisions $700 billion in new spending to stimulate demand for U.S.-manufactured products and on research into clean energy and digital technologies. The Post summarizes:He is advocating a $400 billion procurement initiative to spur demand for American products and services, as well as a $300 billion investment in U.S. research and breakthrough technologies. Half of the $300 billion is in clean-energy initiatives that were previously announced, the campaign said.The plan also calls for the government to launch a 100-day \u201csupply chain review\u201d that could require federal agencies to buy only medical supplies and other goods manufactured in the United States.The plan would tighten rules to ensure products purchased by the federal government are comprehensively made in the United States. The review would determine supply chain \u201cvulnerabilities\u201d to reduce dependence on China for \u2014 among other things \u2014 medical supplies, and create a more robust domestic \u201cstockpile\u201d and \u201cmanufacturing capacity\u201d in crisis conditions.ADAll this highlights Trump\u2019s refusal to marshal federal power behind a testing-and-tracing regimen and the private-sector manufacturing of supplies. Shortages are again causing medical professionals to scramble amid new spikes in cases, and are still impairing capacity to do the testing needed to reopen safely.Industrial policyBiden is proposing what\u2019s known as \u201cindustrial policy.\u201d This employs government intervention to \u201creindustrialize\u201d the United States in specific sectors to achieve deliberate national goals, such as supply preparedness for pandemics or greater manufacturing capacity to reduce dependence on imperiled global supply chains.ADSamuel Hammond, the director of welfare policy at the Niskanen Center, points out that Biden is filling the hole left by Trump\u2019s abandonment of economic populism and his failures in areas where he has lurched in that direction, such as his ill-fated trade wars.AD\u201cThe Trumpian approach is purely negative: Throw tariffs up and hope manufacturing jobs will miraculously return,\u201d Hammond told me. \u201cBiden\u2019s approach is to level up American workers and make our supply chains more resilient. Trump just wants to turn back the clock on globalization.\u201dThe Trumpist mythologyIn the mythological view of Trump\u2019s 2016 victory, the Biden plan is just the sort of thing Trump would do. As Bannon suggested, Trump would break with the reigning GOP orthodoxy of Koch brothers-style libertarianism and \u201cfree\u201d market fundamentalism.ADTrump would use government power to rebuild U.S. manufacturing jobs that \u201cglobalists\u201d drained from the \u201cforgotten\u201d industrial heartland, and to protect the welfare state (particularly social insurance for the elderly) that Paul Ryan-type Republicans wanted to gut.ADThe pandemic offered an opening to marshal federal power. But Trump punted on deploying the Defense Production Act: His main mobilization was to marshal his magical lying powers to make coronavirus disappear.More broadly, as president, Trump fully embraced GOP plutocracy with a massive corporate tax giveaway and an effort to gut health coverage for millions, which continues even amid pandemic conditions.\u201cDemocrats like Biden will always have the upper hand in economic policy, because they actually believe in the power of government,\u201d Hammond told me.ADOf course, this also represents a new direction for Biden, who is associated with the more neoliberal and trade-friendly instincts of centrist Democrats. This plan makes real concessions to progressives who have long criticized those priorities.ADIndeed, a source tells me Biden advisers consulted with Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass) and her team \u2014 who have their own \u201ceconomic patriotism\u201d blueprint \u2014 and deliberately incorporated their contributions.Yet the very fact that Biden is now moving to fill this space itself flips the script on Trump. It also should force a reckoning among those working to create an intellectual \u201cconservative populist\u201d underpinning for Trumpism.Sign up for The Odds newsletter for election updates from data columnist David BylerA reckoning for \u2018conservative populism\u2019The basic take of those intellectuals is that working people are gravitating toward conservative populism because \u201cliberal elites\u201d (and some conservative ones) are all-in with globalization, neoliberal financialization of the economy and identity politics, and working people place higher value on \u201cgoods\u201d like stability and community.ADADThose elites supposedly disdain such values, and have abandoned class politics while ministering only to their new base of \u201cknowledge\u201d workers (the suburban, educated whites who are moving toward Democrats) who are plugged into the globalizing, digitalizing economy.As Jamelle Bouie notes, this narrative defines \u201cworking class\u201d as \u201cwhite working class.\u201d It airbrushes away nonwhite working-class people who see battles for racial justice as central to the struggle for economic justice \u2014 who see racial and class struggle as linked.But in addition to that, these conservative populists should explain why neoliberal elitist Biden and many \u201cidentity politics\u201d progressives embrace a far more robust agenda than Trump in using government power to rebuild the economic foundation of the industrial heartland that liberal elites have supposedly forsaken.ADADAs Hammond notes, some populist conservatives genuinely want government to invest in the working class, but a big chunk of the Trumpian right \u201csees populist rhetoric as a cover for a fundamentally plutocratic agenda of tax cuts and deregulation.\u201dMeanwhile, how is it that Biden and many progressives are able to speak both to racial justice issues and to the need for rebuilding manufacturing capacity, if the former is supposed to represent a selling-out of working-class interests?Trump is supposed to be the ultimate paragon of conservative populism. Yet Biden is filling the vacuum left behind by the fraudulence at the core of that Trumpist vision.Watch Opinions videos:Read more:Kathleen Parker: The case for Valerie Jarrett as Biden\u2019s VP George F.

Footage showed the president in a window seat in economy before a layover in Atlanta and a second flight to Washington. The trip to meet with President Trump, L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s first overseas foray since winning a landslide election two years ago, was in keeping with his populist image of austerity. He abjures excessive expenditure on himself and still plans on raffling off the private luxury jet purchased by his predecessor\u2019s administration.Support our journalism.

Like Trump, he\u2019s under fire at home after letting complacency define his initial response to the coronavirus pandemic.ADADL\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s scheduled Wednesday appearance at the White House provides a strange coda to the final months of the U.S. president\u2019s term. Trump\u2019s campaign was launched, notoriously, on anti-Mexican animus: He decried Mexican \u201crapists,\u201d demonized a judge of Mexican heritage and repeatedly vowed to build a wall between the United States and Mexico, which Mexico would pay for. The southern neighbor became the locus of much that ails Trump\u2019s America \u2014 a beneficiary of unfair trade deals, the staging ground for \u201ccaravans\u201d of illegal infiltrators, the abode of menacing cartels and other criminal elements.For AMLO \u2014 a common nickname for the Mexican president \u2014 Trump, too, presented a useful political foil. Before his election, he spoke of Trump as a \u201cneo-fascist\u201d he likened to Hitler and as \u201can irresponsible bully\u201d whose border wall plans were a \u201cmonument to hypocrisy and cruelty.\u201dBut since L\u00f3pez Obrador came to power it has been a different story. The populist presidents have cultivated a conspicuously amicable friendship, despite the borders that separate them and their politics. Under AMLO\u2019s watch, Mexico has diverted security resources to clamp down on migrants traveling into the country over its southern border. Facing the White House\u2019s punitive tariffs, it agreed to the Trump administration\u2019s controversial Migrant Protection Protocols, which force would-be asylum seekers to await their cases in often unsafe camps in Mexico.ADAD\u201cWe should not have people forced to wait for asylum \u2014 trying to find safety for themselves and their families \u2014 while camped outside in the elements for months at a time,\u201d Sister Norma Pimentel, director of a Texas-based Catholic charity that works with migrants, wrote in a Washington Post op-ed last week. \u201cIt is contrary to our laws and the dictates of humanity.\u201dDemocratic lawmakers in the United States warned that AMLO\u2019s arrival risks politicizing the U.S.-Mexico relationship by shifting the focus away from the disaster of the pandemic. In Mexico, critics have also decried the visit, not least because it appears to endorse an American president with a long track record of demonizing immigrants and insulting Mexicans. Others contend that Mexico has little choice but to find common ground with the White House.\u201cWe are talking about the most powerful man on Earth, Mexico\u2019s most important trade partner. You want to be on good terms with that person,\u201d Viridiana R\u00edos, a Mexican political analyst, told the Guardian. \u201cAt some point during his campaign, [Trump] is going to scapegoat Mexico and Mexicans again. But the key thing is policy: Do we get more out of a Donald Trump who feels empathy towards AMLO and towards his government, or not?\u201d In Washington, optimists hope that differences over immigration won\u2019t disrupt proceedings. The two leaders will celebrate the start of the United States-Mexico-Canada trade deal, a moderately altered version of the previous North American Free Trade Agreement, which Trump vociferously attacked in his campaigning. \u201cThe deal offers investors certainty, but 95 percent of it is basically the same as NAFTA,\u201d Valeria Moy, an economist and professor at the Instituto Tecnol\u00f3gico Aut\u00f3nomo de M\u00e9xico, told my colleagues.ADADCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau opted out of the gathering, placing the spotlight firmly on the other two leaders. Some analysts see them as a pair of demagogic peas in a pod.\u201cBoth seek the absolute dominance of the executive branch,\u201d wrote the Mexican commentator Enrique Krauze. \u201cThey dismiss institutions and the rule of law. They attack the critical independent press: Trump cries \u2018fake news,\u2019 while L\u00f3pez Obrador repeats, \u2018I have other data.\u2019 They scorn science and have confronted the pandemic irresponsibly and ineffectively, and with total lack of empathy. Both cultivate a twisted cult of personality.\u201d\u201cThe two leaders are ideological foes but in some ways kindred spirits: populists whose strengths are in the realm of symbols rather than the substance of government,\u201d noted the Economist.ADADThe significance of L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s visit is expected to remain a mostly symbolic one. Analysts don\u2019t see the leaders emerging from the proceedings with much more than what already has been accomplished. And even then, progress remains somewhat thin.\u201cEconomists say the trade deal is unlikely to drive much new foreign investment, given uncertainty created by the L\u00f3pez Obrador administration,\u201d my colleagues reported. \u201cHe has canceled a new Mexico City airport project and a U.S. firm\u2019s $1.4 billion brewery in Mexicali on allegations of corruption, and backpedaled on reforms to open the energy sector to more private investment.\u201dThe upshot of this summit, argued Genaro Lozano, a professor at Mexico City\u2019s Iberoamerican University, may have little to do with the principals involved. \u201cBoth Republicans and Democrats need to take Mexico and the region as a whole more seriously,\u201d he wrote in Americas Quarterly. \u201cIntegration between the two economies and societies is unstoppable and, if nothing else, Mexico should be a regular stop for U.S. presidential candidates, just as the U.S. is a stop for any Mexican presidential candidate.\u201dRead more: Why Guyana\u2019s political stalemate mattersChina strangles its world cityPutin\u2019s term-limit win suggests stagnation, not strength", "comment": "62 Comments", "topic": "Today's WorldView"}, {"cover": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://d1i4t8bqe7zgj6.cloudfront.net/07-02-2020/t_ef3f7ff26ce343aebecd85ffd795eee4_name_4a47d1f2_bc74_11ea_97c1_6cf116ffe26c_scaled.jpghttps://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?w=145&h=100&src=https://d1i4t8bqe7zgj6.cloudfront.net/07-02-2020/t_ef3f7ff26ce343aebecd85ffd795eee4_name_4a47d1f2_bc74_11ea_97c1_6cf116ffe26c_scaled.jpg", "title": "Trump drops bombshell: \u2018These are numbers\u2019 ", "date": "Jul 2, 2020", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/07/02/trump-drops-bombshell-these-are-numbers/", "keyword": "U.S.-China trade and tariffs", "website": "the Washington Post", "author": "Erik Wemple", "content": "President Trump on Thursday morning appeared before reporters in the White House briefing room to rattle off a bunch of numbers \u2014 unemployment numbers, stock-market numbers, consumer-confidence numbers.
