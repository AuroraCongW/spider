The act imposes sanctions on entities that help violate Hong Kong's autonomy and financial institutions that do business with them, and comes as a response to the passage of a \"national security\" law that tightened Beijing's grip on Hong Kong \u2014 which has been semi-autonomous from the mainland since 1997.The Chinese law, implemented earlier this summer, says that those who destroy government facilities and utilities would be considered subversive. Damaging public transportation facilities and arson would constitute acts of terrorism. Any person taking part in secessionist activities, whether organizing or participating, would violate the law regardless of whether violence is used.It comes after a full year of pro-democracy protests in the former British territory that was handed over to China 23 years ago on the condition that it would keep\u00a0a high degree of autonomy from mainland China and a British-style rule of law \u2014\u00a0a \"one country, two systems\" framework. China has slowly encroached on Hong Kong's autonomy, leading U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo early this year to declare that it is \"no longer autonomous.\"The new law prohibits what Beijing views as secessionist, subversive or terrorist activities or as foreign intervention in Hong Kong affairs and is seen as a direct response to the protest\u2019s calls for democracy. Under the law, police now have sweeping powers to conduct searches without warrants and order internet service providers and platforms to remove messages deemed to be in violation of the legislation.With Trump\u2019s executive order, exports from Hong Kong will be subject to the same tariffs the White House has imposed on goods from mainland China \u2013 marking a blow for leaders in Beijing as they struggle to revamp their economy amid the coronavirus pandemic and cutting off a lucrative loophole. The announcement from Trump also comes a day after the White House rejected nearly all of\u00a0\u2019s claims in the contested South China Sea.The administration presented the decision as an attempt to curb China\u2019s increasing assertiveness in the region with a commitment to recognizing international law. But it will almost certainly have the more immediate effect of further infuriating the Chinese, who are already retaliating against numerous U.S. sanctions and other penalties on other matters.Ties between China and the U.S. have deteriorated steadily over the coronavirus pandemic, human rights, Beijing policy toward Hong Kong and trade. The Trump administration has also slapped visa bans on Chinese officials deemed responsible for barring foreigners\u2019 access to Tibet, along with those seen as enforcing a clampdown on civil rights in Hong Kong.Tensions ratcheted up in the last few days with the actions taken by both the U.S. and China.On Monday, China said\u00a0it will impose sanctions on three U.S. lawmakers and one ambassador in response to similar actions taken by the U.S. last week against Chinese officials over alleged human rights abuses against Muslims in the Xinjiang region.U.S. Senators Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz, Rep. Chris Smith and Ambassador for Religious Freedom Sam Brownback were targeted, as was the Congressional-Executive Commission on China. The four have been critical of the ruling Communist Party\u2019s policies toward minority groups and people of faith.Foreign ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying said the U.S. move had \u201cseriously damaged China-U.S. relations\u201d and that China was determined to uphold its national sovereignty against what it sees as interference in its internal affairs.\u201cChina will respond further according to the development of the situation,\u201d Hua said.", "comment": "(4,177)", "topic": "Donald Trump", "date": " July 14"}, {"cover": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/07/156/88/AP20186092227694.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "title": "Fred Fleitz: At Mount Rushmore, Trump right to highlight danger leftist radicals pose to America", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/trump-mount-rushmore-fred-fleitz", "subtitle": "President Trump celebrated America\u2019s independence and our nation\u2019s 244th birthday Friday night with stirring speech at Mount Rushmore in South Dakota calling attention to serious threats America faces here at home from radical lawbreakers.", "keyword": "U.S.-China trade and tariffs", "website": "Fox News", "author": "", "content": " celebrated America\u2019s independence and our nation\u2019s 244th birthday Friday night with stirring speech at Mount Rushmore in South Dakota calling attention to serious threats America faces here at home from radical lawbreakers. Praising the four presidents whose 60-foot-high heads are carved into a mountain in the Black Hills \u2013 George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln and Theodore Roosevelt \u2013 Trump attacked extremists who  such great Americans and sought to tear down their statues and monuments.\u201cThe radical ideology attacking our country advances under the banner of social justice. But in truth, it would demolish both justice and society,\u201d the president said. \u201cIt would transform justice into an instrument of division and vengeance and turn our free society into a place of repression, domination and exclusion. They want to silence us, but we will not be silenced.\u201dThis celebration at the memorial known as the Shrine to Democracy could not have come at a better time.Our democratic values are being challenged by increasingly intolerant radicals. These leftists misrepresent our history and seek to impose socialism and censorship on those who disagree. As we have seen over the last two months, the radical left is prepared to do this through mob rule and violence.Despite the insistence by the left and the mainstream media that our nation is hopelessly unjust, the United States is an ever-improving great experiment. The vast majority of Americans know this. So does the rest of the world, which is why the United States is by far the leading  for immigrants.Billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk, who was born in South Africa, expressed this in an interview this year about his phenomenal success: \u201cAmerica is the land of opportunity \u2013 there is no other country where I could have done this.\u201dBut the American experiment is fragile.On the final day of the Constitutional Convention in 1787, Benjamin Franklin, was asked: \u201cWhat do we have, a republic or a monarchy?\u201d He replied: \u201cA republic, if you can keep it.\u201dAlthough most Americans reject the radical leftist attacks on our country and history, the views of the extremists will take root unless we forcefully refute them.This means not just rejecting the recent lawlessness led by radical leftist groups like Black Lives Matters (BLM) and Antifa, but actively speaking out to defend our history of freedom. This must include keeping the left\u2019s America-hating, socialist narrative out of our schools.We live in a dangerous world with enemies who would like to end the American experiment and our status as the world\u2019s superpower.Russia tried to interfere in the 2016 presidential election. It will try to do so again this year, along with other nations, especially China.America\u2019s adversaries are encouraging BLM and Antifa to undermine our country. China is openly  BLM to bash the U.S. government and discredit liberal democracies to deflect criticism of Chinese human rights violations.America faces growing international security threats, including the coronavirus pandemic.Russia and China are expanding and improving their nuclear arsenals while America struggles to keep up.North Korea has not ended its nuclear and ballistic missile programs.Iran continues to develop its missile program and likely has robust clandestine nuclear weapons.The threat from radical Islamist terrorism continues and these terrorist groups likely are planning more potent attacks.China is and likely will remain the most serious security threat to the United States and the world. China\u2019s ruling Communist Party is not interested in peaceful co-existence or free and fair trade.Beijing is using diplomatic, military, economic, cyber, and espionage pressure and tools to supplant the United States as the global superpower and install a Chinese-led, anti-democratic world order.China has taken advantage of diverted American attention due to the coronavirus pandemic and violent protests to intensify its efforts to claim the South China Sea as part of its territory and crush what was left of Hong Kong\u2019s democracy.Fortunately, we have a president who recognizes foreign threats and is taking steps to defend our security and freedom. President Trump has built up and modernized our military, greatly improving readiness.The 2018 Nuclear Posture Review is a strategy this administration has acted on to modernize the U.S. nuclear arsenal after years of neglect.The Trump administration destroyed the ISIS state in Syria and Iraq and used military strikes to punish Syria for using chemical weapons against its people.President Trump ended President Barack Obama\u2019s appeasement of Iran by exiting the flawed 2015 nuclear deal.Trump also has called China out on its exploitative trade practices and intellectual property theft, using tariffs to press for free and fair trade. The U.S. and China agreed to a \u201cPhase One\u201d trade deal in January that addressed some of these concerns. Trump officials plan to open talks on a broader \u201cPhase Two\u201d deal if Trump wins reelection.The winner of the 2020 presidential election should continue and build upon these policies.As we celebrate the birth of our nation this weekend, we honor an exceptional nation that is a global beacon of freedom, liberty and opportunity. But the success of the American experiment will not continue unless we aggressively defend our democratic ideals, history of freedom and our national security.", "comment": "(3,938)", "topic": "OPINION", "date": " July 4"}, {"cover": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/07/156/88/gingrich.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "title": "Gingrich calls out Biden: He knows Trump has 'winning message,' so he's stealing it", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/media/newt-gingrich-trump-biden-stealing-message", "subtitle": "Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich said on Monday that President Trump\u00a0has a \"winning message,\" so presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden is trying to steal it.\u00a0", "keyword": "U.S.-China trade and tariffs", "website": "Fox News", "author": "Joshua Nelson", "content": "Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich said on Monday that \u00a0has a \"winning message,\" so presumptive Democratic presidential nominee  is trying to steal it.\u201cI think that proves that Biden has good pollsters.

I'm Laura Ingraham. This is \"The Ingraham Angle\" from Washington tonight. Now, while he sees police force retires in droves, New York Mayor Bill de Blasio was personally putting the finishing touches on a Black Lives Matter mural in front of Trump Tower, that's going to create a lot of jobs Bill.Former NYPD Commissioner Bernie Kerik, oh, boy he's here. You don't want to miss it. It's going to be a scorcher.Also, ignoring the science on COVID has induced a war on American life. Now, we're now seeing this play out as colleges are curtailing and canceling football and other fall sports. Former coach, the great Lou Holtz is here to tell us why losing football is devastating for the American psyche.But first, \"Biden's America Last Campaign,\" that's the focus of \"Tonight's Angle.\" Joe Biden's campaign must obviously not be too confident in the polls, showing him up over the President, because if he was really confident why would he attempt a policy makeover this late in the campaign? Why would a guy who has been one of the worst apologists for globalism suddenly try to out Trump, Trump, by selling himself as a passionate believer in America first populism?(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOE BIDEN, D-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We're going to double this foreign tax -- the tax on foreign profits, so we don't encourage people to leave. I do not accept the defeat as you that forecast that automatic -- automation and globalization mean we can't keep well paid jobs here in America and create more of them. I do not buy it for one second, the vitality of American manufacturing is the thing of the past.(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM: Now, where have heard that before? Donald Trump. Well, Biden suddenly mimicking him, because his handlers know it's a huge weak spot. They know that in order to win, he's going to need some of that blue-collar love from voters in Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Wisconsin.Now, don't forget that according to RealClearPolitics, voters still approve of President Trump's handling the economy. So Joe's team, they decided that he should say something about the economy, don't you think other than promising to lock it down. Now, of course, he has nothing to say. He had almost 50 years to build a record on economic issues, and he utterly failed.So like the rest of his campaign, Biden's economic claims are just another act. They're sleight of hand. Based on his campaign's view that most Americans aren't that smart, and that the press, of course, will provide cover for all of his mistakes.Now, after all, this is the same guy who voted for one bad trade deal after another, including both NAFTA in that catastrophic decision to normalize trade relations with China. Now, that colossal mistake of a bill, not only fast-tracked China's nation -- China's entry into the WTO, but it also gutted American industry, and it destroyed millions of American jobs.Well, I forget almost that Biden was a vocal supporter of the Trans-Pacific Partnership. That was a deal that was so bad even Hillary Clinton could not defend it. She backed away from it. Now, to be fair to Biden, he probably didn't think too hard about any of these votes.After all, he's a Senator from Delaware -- he was, where lots of multinational companies get their charters, and he's probably just doing as he was told. Just like he'll do if he gets in the White House.Now, you think that a guy with almost five decades of political experience, would be proud to tout his record, but not Joe Biden. After decades of doing whatever the globalist wanted and pushing for policies and treaties that gutted American jobs and drove down wages. He wants you to believe that now at the age of almost 80, he's finally seen the error of his ways. At long last, he'll abandon the Clinton-Obama internationalist playbook.So all of a sudden he trundles over to scrim and read this speech designed to make it sound like someone who really cares about American workers. The whole charade is absurd on its face. It's basically an insult to our intelligence. Democrats have told us time and again, what they really think of saving key American industries.Now remember, he was Vice President for eight years, the Democrats had plenty of time to revise NAFTA, stand up to China and push policies that would lead to higher wages. They didn't do any of that. Instead, they promoted exactly the same type of outsourcing policies that the Bushes and the Clintons pushed, and Biden was with them every step of the way. So you want to know what Joe and his party really think of American workers, listen to them in their own words.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BIDEN: Anybody could go down 300 to 3,000 feet in the mind, sure in hell can learn how to program as well. Anybody can throw coal into a furnace, can learn how to program for god sake/HILLARY CLINTON, FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE: We're going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business.BARACK OBAMA, FORMER PRESIDENT: Some of those jobs of the past are just not going to come back.(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM: Maybe he's going to wave his magic wand. Oh, who's going to be able to renegotiate these deals? Obama said. Well, Trump was. Now, why am I not surprised that people who despise America would also despise American workers? Thank God, Trump never believed that defeat is nonsense. Trump didn't just promise to revise NAFTA, he got new provisions in it that would make it harder to ship auto jobs to Mexico.And he didn't just promise to stand up to China. He whacked them with tariffs for their cheating. And he didn't just promise to resist international bureaucrats, he shut down the WTO's Dispute Settlement system in response to its obvious anti-American bias.So is Joe Biden likely to continue fighting for American workers in the same way? Of course, not. Don't make me laugh, OK. I'm already laughing through his speech today. The moment the first Canadian or European bureaucrat raises an eyebrow, the moment the first member of the press asked a hard question, the moment the first CEO gets Biden on the phone, his administration will cave and the outsourcing party begins again.Of course, all of this will help the rich. Big hedge funds will be thrilled. They're desperate for the days of easy returns by selling out to the CCP, and Biden's just their man. Look at it this way. If Joe were truly a made in the USA kind of guy, would a guy like Mike Bloomberg be supporting him?Ignore the happy talk and the fake blue-collar events. To understand Biden's real agenda, we don't have to look any further than the 110-page document released yesterday, a joint product of the Biden campaign and the Bernie Bros. I prefer to call it Biden's roadmap to ruin.Now, a climate task force will push for a Green New Deal and calls for the U.S. to rejoin the Paris Accord. Leading the effort will be those well- known nationalists, John Kerry and AO.C Say goodbye to the U.S. energy sector, my friends, too bad Texas, tough luck, Pennsylvania.Then the criminal justice task force, that will boast an impressive roster of big thinkers, including Senator Biden aide, Symone Sanders. \"The Washington Post\" described her as someone who pushed the campaign to be wary of language that frustrates black activists, urging staffers to avoid the term white working class.Mr. Fast and Furious himself, former Obama AG Eric Holder, also took part. Well, their demands are a law enforcement nightmare. Federal use of force standards, making it easier to sue police, national registry of police officers who abuse power -- whatever that means, repealing mandatory minimums, expunging all past convictions for pot and juvenile criminal activities, no prison time at all for failure to pay fines for child support, no cash bail, and appointing activist judges -- that'll be a varsity sport.So there's a lot in there that's great for Tony Soprano and his crew maybe, but nothing for law abiding citizens. To Biden in this team, that's what you get for liking America. Of course, such an array of radical ideas is only going to ensure more racial injustice.And isn't that you are trying many of these same proposals about the police and defunding them as we speak? And look what's happening there. We have massive police retirements, massive crime, the President talked about it tonight. People with money are leaving New York City in droves. So imagine those policies of Bill de Blasio coming to a neighborhood near you? Well, unlike Biden, Trump doesn't have to pretend to believe in America first. He's already proven it.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: It was always, yes, China will catch America. We took in tens of billions of dollars in tariffs that they paid for.Our immigration system is stretched far beyond the breaking point. To confront this national security crisis, I declared a national emergency.Many emergency declarations have been used to protect people in faraway nations. Now we are protecting, finally, our people.-- add that under my administration, we've delivered $1.5 billion for public charter schools. That's a record.(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM: Now watching Biden, on the other hand, trying to pretend to care about, oh, the schools, the kids, the blue-collar workers, it's almost a repellent. Almost every action in his career and of his party now, and virtually everything that Democrat Party wants today, represents an attack on the middle class -- traditional American families, working Americans.Team Biden will ship your jobs to china and lock you in your homes. They'd shut down churches and schools, they'd let rioters loot and burn, they'd punish the police and free the criminals. This November pay no attention to empty Democrat promises about all the free stuff they're finally going to give you. I've been listening to those promises my whole life. If they had any meaning, we'd all be on Easy Street by now.Remember the jobs we lost to China, the storefronts destroyed by the riots, the cops threatened and humiliated by Left Wing nuts, the kids who still can't go to school. That's the real Democratic Party, and they're coming for you. And that's \"The Angle.\"Joining me now is Larry Kudlow, White House economic adviser. Larry, good to see you tonight. If Biden was serious about empowering American workers, he did the big populist push today. Why didn't he actually do that during his 40 plus years in DC?LARRY KUDLOW, NATIONAL ECONOMIC COUNCIL DIRECTOR: Well, it's good point. He had his chance, particularly with Obama, last eight years before President Trump. We had one of the worst recoveries in history.Look, you go down the list and look at that campaign document, first of all, he intends to repeal every tax cut that President Trump put in to rejuvenate the economy. And let me make this point, despite the mantra of the Democrats that all tax cuts help the rich.The Trump tax cuts did exactly what we hoped. That is, middle income, blue collar workers, lower wage earners performed the best, not only with the lowest unemployment rate in history, but their wage increase was faster than the top 1 percent. And the unemployment rates for African Americans and Hispanics and Asians and women were at historic lows.Plus, Biden's going to add new taxes, today he said by the way. He does want to have the stock market. He doesn't want to have shareholders involved in the stock market. Well, besides pension funds, and even union pension funds 51 percent are invested in the stock market, which I might add is up 40 percent since the laws.He's going to rewrite all of the regulatory reductions that President Trump put in to help small businesses --INGRAHAM: Oh, it's going to be a nightmare.KUDLOW: --to hire workers.INGRAHAM: Nightmare.KUDLOW: He's for the Green New Deal, which will -- and he can talk about coal mines all he wants. But if you go with the Green New Deal, that means all fossil fuels gone.INGRAHAM: Well, it's Biden energy sector.KUDLOW: It will have an incredibly negative effect on the economy.INGRAHAM: Larry, let me get in here. Let me get in here, because I think what Biden sees, obviously, he's had a disadvantage in arguing these points. It's obvious. His whole career speaks to internationalism and exporting jobs to china.But he also can say now, because you all have and done it, I'm going to bring back drug manufacturing. I'm going to do this. Trump says he was going to do it from China. I'm going to do it. Why hasn't the Trump administration moved on that order? I know Peter Navarro and others have been pushing. It was reported today. Why are we not bringing back some of these drugs and bringing them back stat, to use a medical term.KUDLOW: Well, but that's exactly what we're trying to do. Not only pharmaceuticals, but semiconductors --INGRAHAM: Well, what's holding it up?KUDLOW: --retailers. Well, there's nothing holding it up. We are -- when we come out with our program, we're already in discussion with lots of companies based in China. We had a discussion today. A leading semiconductor company is selling their factories in China and coming back home. We will give them the lowest corporate tax rates, we will give them perhaps tax credits, certainly 100 percent expensing. We may use some government funds to pay for their moving costs.We have a whole campaign planned. We're warning American investors not to invest in Chinese stocks because of the fraudulent accounting. Robert O'Brien and I have already warned, the Thrift Savings Plan and the Railroad Retirement Fund. So we are doing exactly that. And we're taking steps to deal with this Hong Kong disaster. So I don't think it's right to say we haven't done it. We've been doing it.And the tax reform itself, we made it so easy to repatriate profits and capital come back to the United States. In a second Trump term, you'll see a lot more of that.INGRAHAM: And so we -- you can commit tonight that we will bring back these crucial drugs and the manufacturing, even if the price goes up a little bit at home, in order to secure our stockpile of critical medications?KUDLOW: I think, Laura, that we learned -- not the only country, other countries. But United States learned that China is not to be trusted, period, full stop. And that we cannot rely on these long-complicated supply chains coming out of China. I think you'll see the whole business community.You don't see business school professors saying now the supply chains don't work. We got to bring it back home, because China is not reliable. They're not the only ones who are unreliable. But I hear the same thing for people around the world, so that's going to be a major change.But we have got to continue low taxes and deregulation and fair-trade deals. If we do that, we will come through this pandemic, I think we're going to get 20 percent growth in the second half. Hopefully, the virus hotspots will be subdued and mitigated, and I think we're going to have a big bang in 2021.We were coming into this strong, you know that. The tax cuts worked, deregulation worked, the energy worked, the trade worked.INGRAHAM: In real short --KUDLOW: We just had the USMCA. We just had the USMCA. President Obrador was here. A lot of goodwill. That's(CROSSTALK)INGRAHAM: Larry, real quick --KUDLOW: --percentage points to GDP.INGRAHAM: Real quick. Isn't it really important that people understand, comparing our response to COVID to Europe's response, our economy is faring far better than the major European countries. I don't think a lot of voters know that. But when you look at the charts, it's undeniable. Trump's policies, post COVID are working economically. Biden wants to turn that back by locking us all down as do those Democrat mayors. Real quick, Larry.KUDLOW: Well, we -- look, we have a strong V shaped recovery. There's some recovery in Europe, by the way, but we do have a strong recovery. Let me just say this in closing.I am concerned about the virus hotspots -- and I will say this. If you want to reopen our economy, if you want to let the President rebuild our economy for the second time, the best thing we can do is take the safety measures, use the face mask. The President said that tonight with Sean. Keep the distancing. The testing is so important in the hotspots and personal hygiene. If you practice that, then we will stabilize the hotspots and we will be off to the races in a strong economy. That's where we started, and it can continue.INGRAHAM: Larry great to see it. Tonight, thanks so much for joining us.And American cities are already getting a preview of what life will be like under the Biden administration. Angry mobs burning down businesses, defacing monuments. Of course, we see the rampant crime, and all-out assault on police by the people who are supposed to be leading the people and keeping them safe. It'll only get worse if Biden wins.Joining me now Bernie Kerik, former NYPD Commissioner. Bernie, you've heard me in \"The Angle.\" No cash bail, no prison for not paying child support. I don't need to repeat the whole thing. This is what Biden's plan is. What will that mean for Americans streets, neighborhoods, communities?BERNARD KERIK, FORMER NYPD COMMISSIONER: Chaos. Chaos, violent crime, murder. We already know in every one of the Democratic cities around the country. The major cities like Chicago and Baltimore and Milwaukee, Minnesota, places like that. They're already the highest crime -- the highest violent crime, the highest murder rates. It's only going to get worse.This diminishing, defunding the police departments is going to create mass chaos. We're seeing it right here with the reductions that this mayor has already started on reducing the street crime units, the plainclothes units.INGRAHAM: Well, the NYPD, Bernie, is seeing this disturbing mass exodus. \"National Review\" said that 179 cops filed for retirement between June 29th and Monday, a 411 percent increase over the 35 who filed during the same period last year. So this is exactly what the Black Lives Matter and the radical left want to see happen, right? Drive police out of the streets, drive police off the force and demoralize the population, so they just say, OK, I'll vote for Biden to make it stop, I guess.KERIK: And that's what the mayor did today. By standing on Fifth Avenue, drawing that mural for Black Lives Matter, knowing that this is a trained Marxist group, that they were inspired by a domestic terrorists convicted of killing a cop, that they've called for the murders of cops, that they've yelled and chant, \"pigs in a blanket, fry like bacon,\" \"the only good cops are dead cops.\"They're responsible for all the riots in 44 states, 76 cities around the country that injured 500 cops. He's out there painting that mural. You know what that says to every New York City cop? I despise you. I despise you.And he himself -- and I got to remind people of this. He is no better than the founders of Black Lives Matter, the Marxist. He himself is a Marxist. If you go back to 1987 when he was 26 years old. He was the guy standing out there saying Nicaragua's troubles are my troubles too, supporting the Sandinistas. He's a lunatic. He should not be in office.INGRAHAM: Well, New York -- I mean, will New York ever wake up or is this the city they want? Because everyone I know is leaving New York. Bernie. It's a complete disgrace. Thank you for your words of wisdom tonight.And the media was downright giddy about the Supreme Court's ruling on Trump's tax returns. But they were wrong. They shouldn't be. Our legal Eagles will explain why this actually might be a huge political victory for Trump. You bet. Stay there.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)ARI MELBER, MSNBC CHIEF LEGAL CORRESPONDENT: A big loss for President Trump here.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I find this to be a very dark day for Donald Trump. This is his greatest fear.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: If he doesn't win reelection, he is potentially going to see a criminal indictment as a private person.NEAL KATYAL, FORMER FEDERAL PROSECUTOR: I'm Donald Trump. I am scared right now.(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM: It's scary that the guy was the Solicitor General of the United States. Well, the truth is that one of the rulings today completely destroyed Congress's gross unconstitutional overstep in trying to obtain Trump's tax returns.So yes, the High Court did rule that the Manhattan D.A. Cyrus Vance could subpoena the tax documents. But it's not the stirring victory the Left would have you believe. You actually have to read the opinions.Now, first, the case was remanded back to the lower court, where Trump's lawyers can make more constitutional arguments to draw up the case. And second, even if a court expedites its decision, the tax returns would go to a grand jury, meaning they'll still be secret.Now, in fact, the Manhattan D.A. may not see the President's tax returns for many more months or many more years. This is just harassment, come on. In other words, there's almost zero chance that Trump's taxes become public before the November election.Joining me now is John Eastman, Claremont Institute Senior Fellow, Constitutional Scholar; also Sol Wisenberg, former deputy independent counsel. So you say this isn't really the win that Vance in New York thinks it is, why?SOL WISENBERG, DEP WHITEWATER INDEPENDENT COUNSEL: Well, even though President Trump and the DOJ lost on their overall legal argument. Remember, all the court said was that the President does not have absolute immunity from state criminal processes.But that's kind of a theoretical question, Laura, they then send it back to the lower courts, as you say, and President Trump is free to say all right. But in this particular instance, this subpoena is a problem. This subpoena, for example, is nothing but a retaliatory effort to interfere with my executive powers.They're still free to make any argument they want with respect to the particular subpoena. Why was it issued at this particular time? Why do you want my -- why exactly do you need these tax returns? So, yes, they lost on their legal points, which I don't think most people thought they were going to win on anyway. But as a practical matter, I think it's a win, certainly in the short term.INGRAHAM: John, your thoughts on this. This seems like this opens the door in a way for any rogue, State AG or DA to harass the President of the United States anytime they have an ideological dispute, not to impart bad motives on all Democrat DAs. But it certainly opens up a can of worms down the road for other Presidents, perhaps.JOHN EASTMAN, CLAREMONT INSTITUTE SENIOR FELLOW: Well, it does open it up perhaps. But I agree with Sol, and that's not what -- I mean, I was watching the news today and wondered whether the news reports were reading the same opinion I was reading. I mean, I think the Chief Justice, and the and the large majority of the court went out of its way to try and prevent that kind of rogue district attorney from harassing the President.He said the entire the entire conduct of the proceeding needs to be conducted with the fact that this is the President of United States and the Office of Chief Executive in mind. And it specifically says that the President can challenge these subpoenas as an attempt to influence the performance of his duties that would violate the supremacy clause.And so, you don't have absolute immunity from the subpoena, but we're not going to allow witch hunts for partisan political gain against a sitting president or a presidential candidate. And I think the court made clear on that.So I don't think this is a win for Vance at all. The Second Circuit decision was affirmed, and that just means the president doesn't have absolute immunity, but the things that are handed to him are more than enough to force him having to disclose.INGRAHAM: Got it. Sol, I want to move on to John Durham, because there's so many people waiting for the results of his investigation, but FOX News is reporting exclusively that Durham does not want this to be viewed politically, and the closer it gets to November, Durham could punt it until after the election. Sol, if this report is delayed until after election, it's never going to the light of day, we might not ever know what was really down to the president or what nefarious efforts were undertaken at the FBI and beyond.WISENBERG: First of all, we don't know that there's going to be a report. He's not a report, he's not a special counsel. He may just tell the story in any indictments that get issued. I would also say there's a considerable amount of time between an election if the president loses and the following term.But listen, I have a lot of faith in Durham. He's got a sterling reputation. And as Attorney General Barr said -- first of all, Attorney General Barr said he doesn't think there is even going to be in an investigation, a criminal investigation of former President Obama or President Biden. If you take those two out of the equation, as Barr said, who are we going to be looking that is going to be running for office? Nobody. So I don't really -- I'll believe it when I see it. I think Durham is being methodical. He doesn't want anyone to say that this is political on his part, and given his reputation, I don't think they will.INGRAHAM: John, really quickly, your reaction to the shocking decision by Federal District Judge Emmet Sullivan to refuse to dismiss the case against Flynn. He is now asking the appeals court en banc to rule about whether to keep the Flynn case alive. John, real quick.EASTMAN: Did he not get the basic separation of powers thing? He doesn't get to bring motions to another court. He's not the party in the case. He doesn't get to appoint his own prosecutor. He is supposed to be the judge. This is just getting laughable. But I hope the en banc circuit, D.C. circuit will slap it down, and slap the judge down too, rather than just the case.INGRAHAM: If you can sanction the judge in this case, I would be all for that. This is a travesty. We've got to roll. Guys, thanks so much.And despite the fact that college aged students are extremely low risk as the task force said yesterday, various leagues now have already started canceling their sports in the fall. Legendary former Notre Dame coach Lou Holtz is here next. Why canceling football is not just ignoring science but could actually crush the American spirit. Stay there.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)INGRAHAM: I was thinking about this today, what we are in the middle of here, it kind of amounts to a war against our way of life. Because after the riots subsided and it became clear that the U.S. economy was improving, and improving really rapidly under President Trump's policies, I think the left and started to freak out a little bit. Can't have all those people working at having fun again. So how could they keep the panic and anxiety going to ensure a Biden victory?(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Dr. Fauci says the United States is knee-deep in the crisis.DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES: I think any state that is having a serious problem, that state should seriously look at shutting down.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Look how steep that curve is, and you think the only way now to change that is to shut down?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We're not dropping cases in our immunity with tests and trace and masking, then yes.(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM: Deaths are going down, cases are going up, so no fun for America.OK, now, a few states of course have seen the rise in positive cases, but again, the daily death rate has been dropping like a rock since peaking in April. This is actually good news. We're getting closer to herd immunity in some sectors of the United States. We also have T cell immunity, talked about that the other night. So it's a serious disease, especially, though, for the old and vulnerable. Most people do quite well with it under the age of 25, most people will be fine, again, with some rare exceptions. Kids who are college aged and younger, what about them?(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DR. DEBORAH BIRX, WHITE HOUSE CORONAVIRUS RESPONSE COORDINATOR: We know that mortality rate in under 25 from the CDC data is less than 0.1 percent.We have no evidence that there is significant mortality in children without coexisting diseases.(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM: So despite this extremely low risk for young people with COVID, colleges around the country seem to be rushing into the fearmongering stage, the panic stage. And the left seems to enjoy this moment where sports seems to be ending.Now yesterday, the Ivy League announced it would cancel all sports in the fall, including football. Just how big a deal is this? Yale won't be playing Princeton or Harvard for the first time since World War II. As expected, the dominoes continue to fall. From there, the Big Ten said today it wouldn't allow any out of conference games for football or any other sport, citing these unprecedented times. But at the end of the day, the commissioner couldn't even promise that.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)KEVIN WARREN, BIG TEN COMMISSIONER: One thing we have to realize is that this is not a fait accompli that we're going to have sports in the fall. We may not have sports in the fall. We may not have a college football season in the Big Ten.(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM: Well, this mindset isn't just taking over colleges, it's trickling down the high schools well. Superintendent of Dallas public schools, have some good football teams there, made this stunning announcement today.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MICHAEL HINOJOSA, DALLAS INDEPENDENT SCHOOL DISTRICT SUPERINTENDENT: I seriously doubt it. I don't know. We're not in control of that. The university interscholastically gives us guidance on that. But that's a true contact sport. I don't know how we can pull it off. There's been some discussion of moving it to the spring, but we'll have to wait and see. I seriously doubt we can pull it off.(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM: Because there is no inherent risk in playing football. The kids don't out there and put their health at risk just playing the sport. Specifically, one of the greatest coaches of all time is Lou Holtz, Notre Dame Hall of Fame coach. Lou, I'm so glad you're here tonight. I say this kind of feels like a war on American life. No church, no singing, no school, no football. Where does it end?LOU HOLTZ, FOOTBALL ANALYST: I think it ends when we have the election. When you're in a leadership role, Laura, you have to look at things from both points of view. As a coach I'd look at it from a player's point of view as well as from a coach's point of view. The way it is right now, they just don't want to have sports, and there's no way in this world you can do anything in this world without a risk. People stormed Normandy. I took some grandchildren over there. They knew there was going to be casualties, they knew there was going to be risk, but it was a way of life.Now if you eliminate all nonconference games, first of all, you have seven teams in the Big Ten that schedule four patsies so they know they're going to win four games, with two conference games, they can go to the bowl. That ain't going to happen. But let me tell you the devastating effect it's going to have is then the nonpower five schools, my son is head coach at Louisiana Tech. He used to play Baylor, Vanderbilt, those are money games, those are very, very important. But how are you going to have football when they don't even want to have school? Some schools like Notre Dame has said, OK, we're going to start on August 10th. Now some of faculty members say, oh, it's too risky, I don't want to go. You have teachers' unions saying you shouldn't go back to school. The underprivileged, the people from the poor neighborhoods, where they going to get education? What has happened to our way of life? Look at it from both points of view. The risk is always there, but you cannot just look at it from one side, and that's exactly what's happening. And I think it will end on Election Day.INGRAHAM: Lou, it seems to me that there are a lot of people on the left especially who have wanted to get rid of football for some time. All the op-eds about, of course it's a dangerous sport, it's a brutal sport, it's a misogynistic sport. Football has been trashed by the left for a couple of decades. So you get the sense that they think they have football right where they want it. But Notre Dame, Alabama, even some of those Ivy League schools, the Pac 10, Ohio, the Buckeyes, they all want to play football. When are we going to hear from coaches and players who say let us assume the risk? We'll assume the risk, let our players play. Are we going to hear from any of them or no?HOLTZ: I don't think so, but if I were coaching I would sure speak up. I've had people say I don't want my son to play football so I'm going to go buy him a motorcycle so he'll have something to do other than football.I want to tell you, Laura. I can't begin to tell you the lessons people learn in football. It's a microcosm of life. You learn about sacrifice, you learn about teamwork, getting along with other people. You learn to work on your skills to make sacrifices, to make a total commitment to other people for the welfare of the overall team and unit. There is so many valuable lessons you learn from it, and when you are part of a team, people want to be part of something. That is how games came about. When they started emphasizing athletics in schools, then people started enjoying the game, because young people wanted to be part of something, and you are that away from them?INGRAHAM: Coach, I want to quickly get to your view on the now push to get Notre Dame to reconsider the Fighting Irish nickname. OK, as a former coach at Notre Dame, what are your thoughts on that? Apparently, that is now politically incorrect.HOLTZ: I think that's ridiculous. They were named the Fighting Irish because the Ku Klux Klan tried to attack the Catholics. They went down and fought the Ku Klux Klan, and that is where the name the Fighting Irish came. Now day you're going to tell me they want to topple my statue Notre Dame. That is when I will really get mad.INGRAHAM: Coach Holtz, before we go, on behalf of all of us at \"The Ingraham Angle,\" I want to express our great condolences for your incredible wife, the lovely Beth. I know you were married for 58 years. She was an amazing woman, and I know it just hurts in your heart, and we heard for you, coach.HOLTZ: Thank you, Laura. If I could make one comment, we had the funeral at Notre Dame Basilica, there couldn't be many people, but we have gotten so many thousands of texts and emails. I wish they had done it when she was alive. So everybody listen, please sit down while somebody's still living and tell them the difference they made in your life. Do it while they can appreciate it. Thank you.INGRAHAM: Lou, we will, and you have made a huge difference to so many players and alumni and students and me, personally, over the years. So thank you so much for everything you do. We really appreciate it.HOLTZ: Thank you. Now I have to watch your program alone. And I enjoy your program, but it will be sad.INGRAHAM: Thanks so much, Lou.HOLTZ: Thank you.INGRAHAM: And being a medical professional who tells the truth about COVID figures gets you smeared professionally, ostracized, even targeted by medical boards. Two men who found themselves in that position at times are here with their stories, next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)INGRAHAM: For challenging the medical establishment, may be the medical deep state, and exposing a massive flaw in our COVID response, my next two guests have found themselves on the wrong side of that medical mafia. Here now is Dr. Scott Jensen, physician, Minnesota state senator, and Dr. Stephen Smith, founder of the Smith Center for Infectious Diseases and Urban Health. Dr. Jensen, you found legitimate flaws in the CDC's guidelines. Now you're being targeted by your state's health board. Explain briefly.DR. SCOTT JENSEN, PHYSICIAN: Basically, I'm being told that because I questioned the Department of Health and the CDC's communications that I've been spreading misinformation. I think this is ludicrous. If you want to know who is spreading misinformation, if the governor comes out and tells Minnesotans they are going to have 74,000 deaths and then later on reduces it to 29,000 deaths, and then later on gives us another statistic and says in mid-July, which is next week, we're going to have 1,000 deaths per day, to me that would be more misinformation than me saying hey, listen, death certificates are a serious thing and we should be doing it right.INGRAHAM: Dr. Smith, you've turned into a pariah of sorts by your own hospital because of your advocacy for and use of, successfully, I might add, hydroxychloroquine. Tell us about it.DR. STEPHEN SMITH, SMITH CENTER OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES: In the beginning when I adopted the French regimen, which was 600 milligrams a day, as opposed to the 2,400 milligrams lower dose that people were using, CDC, actually the FDA eventually endorsed, I got immediate pushback from the CMO at one of the hospitals we go to. Immediate. Like, we'll take it from here, Stephen, after I sent them the article. I said, what? He came in on a Saturday and I was still in the hospital working my tail off, and I said, no, you won't touch my patients.And since then, I don't know why -- I didn't know I was creating controversy. I thought I was following the data like I always do. And it's a safe drug, a cheap drug. And I got in another argument with the CMO of the system. He said, if we give everybody 600 milligrams a day, which is only 6,000, as opposed to 2,400 milligrams, we're going to run out of hydroxychloroquine. I said I don't believe him. He hung up on me. That was after maybe I had spent three hours taking care of 50 of his patients.INGRAHAM: Earlier today, earlier today Dr. Fauci was asked if we can control COVID without a vaccine. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES: I think we can get it under control but keeping it under control is going to be the real problem. This virus, to our dismay, is spectacularly efficient in transmitting from person to person. That makes me skeptical whether we would get permanent, sustained control of this without having a vaccine.(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM: OK, Dr. Jensen. The translation -- get ready to be locked down until Biden is elected. I'm sorry, I hear that, and my blood boils. It is a virus, it's a bad virus, but most people do fine with it. Could this be with us forever? And vaccines aren't 100 percent useful anyway, in most cases.JENSEN: I would ask Dr. Fauci why in the world he would use the word \"spectacularly.\" That sounds like just fearmongering. And I would ask, what RNA viruses have we been successful at in terms of creating a vaccine that really does what we want? We know that with our influenza vaccine, we frequently face just terribly mediocre results. And if you look at other coronavirus viruses, whether you're talking about SARS or MERS, we don't have a great track record. So the fact of the matter is, if a vaccine comes along to help us, that's great, but we are far more realistically leaning into herd immunity.INGRAHAM: Yes, the Henry Ford Health System study on hydroxy has come under fire. Not only was the study not randomized, outside experts noting the patients who received hydroxy were also more likely to get steroids. Dr. Smith, you've read the study, you've treated all these patients successfully. What are your thoughts?SMITH: It's really hard to -- actually it's harder to show something works than doesn't work. And obviously we've had several trials showing this drug or drug combination works very well. Our data support that. There are many other trials that show that. And when you see efficacy, you really take notice, because, again, it's harder to prove something works in this situation then to say it's neutral. It's a lot easier to say he doesn't have an effect for a bunch of reasons.INGRAHAM: And it's a generic drug and it doesn't cause $4,000 a course like remdesivir. Gentlemen, thank you so much. Great to see you.An important Last Bite, next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BAIER: A policy of never-ending lockdowns month after month would ultimately do more harm than good to public health, and so bad for our children.

Its mass detention of Uyghurs, its godless decisions to replace church displays of the Ten Commandments with words from General Secretary Xi have not gone without being called out.\"Despite the recent tough talk, the administration has seemed to take a hodgepodge of stances on criticizing China, oftentimes depending on the issue. Trump has railed against China for taking advantage of the United States on trade deals since the 2016 campaign. But\u00a0he's often praised Chinese President Xi Jinping himself.Meanwhile, the U.S. has maintained a consistent message against China's claims in the South China Sea during the Trump administration, regularly executing freedom of navigation operations with U.S. Navy vessels. But Trump himself roiled Republicans last fall when he congratulated Xi on his country's 70th anniversary, refraining from any criticism of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).The Trump administration has sought to stymie the Chinese-controlled tech company Huawei from global 5G networks \u2014\u00a0something it just secured a major victory\u00a0at with the United Kingdom recently deciding to freeze Huawei out of its 5G infrastructure. But Trump, according to a memoir by his former National Security Adviser John Bolton, had indicated he personally didn't care about China's repression of ethnic minorities, specifically the Uyghur Muslims.\"At the opening dinner of the Osaka G20 meeting, with only interpreters present, Xi explained to Trump why he was basically building concentration camps in Xinjiang. According to our interpreter, Trump had said that Xi should go ahead with building the camps, which he thought was exactly the right thing to do,\" Bolton said. \"[Deputy National Security Advisor Matt] Pottinger told me Trump said something very similar during the 2017 trip to China, which meant we could cross repression of Uighurs off our list of possible reasons to sanction China, at least as long as trade negotiations continued.\"Trump and those in his administration have repeatedly condemned Bolton and his book, denying many of the allegations it contains.Now, amid the continuing fallout from the president's handling of the coronavirus pandemic, with Trump angrily deflecting blame for the virus toward China -- where it originated -- Pompeo and the State Department are putting rhetorical pressure on China with\u00a0renewed vigor.\"Countries that want to be global powers, countries that want to participate on the global stage, have a corresponding obligation to comply to the promises they make. China made a promise to the World Health Organization. There's a set of rules about disclosure, and when you have\u00a0 an incident in your country that could potentially lead to a pandemic, you have an obligation to report that and allow others co tome in and helo,\" Pompeo said in a video tweeted last week that was originally on The Hill's \"Virtually Live.\"The United States has withdrawn from the World Health Organization over its alleged compliance with China in covering up the coronavirus in its initial stages.Pompeo added: \"The Chinese Communist Party chose differently, they co-opted the World Health Organization to achieve that coverup, and the result today is that we have hundreds of thousands of people who have died and trillions of dollars in global damage as a direct result.\"Trump got at a similar point in an interview with \"Fox News Sunday.\"\"It came from China. They should've never let it escape. They should've never let it out,\" he said.Trump later continued: \"The World Health got a tremendous amount wrong. They basically did whatever China wanted them to. And we'll save now almost $500 million a year, which is nice. But the World Health got a lot wrong.\"China, meanwhile, has shot back in the diplomatic war of words, accusing the United States of mishandling the coronavirus and even at one point falsely accusing the U.S. Army of introducing the virus into China.\"The #US politicizes #COVID19 response at home and uses 'attacking China'\u00a0as a panacea for domestic problems. A real-life #HouseofCards\u00a0is on in #Washington, with people's lives at stake,\" Hua Chunying, a  for the country's foreign ministry, said in a tweet last week.It's unclear where U.S.-China relations could go from this increasingly hostile juncture, with another grand trade deal, cooperation on North Korea or reconciliation on geopolitical claims in East Asia looking increasingly unlikely. But any kind of military conflict still appears far-fetched, and\u00a0neither nation appears poised to institute new tariffs on the other -- private businesses in both countries continue to work in the other, with American businesses like the NBA still reluctant to even  China's human rights abuses, let alone take any action or make any statements on the matter.For now, tit-for-tat sanctions appear to be as far as either country will go, with Trump this month signing the Hong Kong Autonomy Act, a bill to sanctions Chinese entities that have contributed to eroding the freedoms once enjoyed in Hong Kong and financial institutions that do business with them. The\u00a0executive branch also announced sanctions in relation to the oppression of the Uyghur Muslims.Meanwhile, China\u00a0sanctioned some U.S. individuals, including Republican Sens. Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio. Cruz, a close ally of the administration, echoed the rhetoric from Pompeo in his response.\"Unfortunately for CCP leaders, I don't have plans to travel to the authoritarian regime that covered up the coronavirus pandemic and endangered millions of lives worldwide,\" Cruz said in a statement that also condemned\u00a0the \"horrific forced abortions and sterilizations\" of the Uyghur Muslims.", "comment": "(666)", "topic": "State Department", "date": " July 20"}, {"cover": "https://a57.foxnews.com/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/694940094001/064a71f3-1fd5-4b55-8807-b02ac055c485/2c2bbcc7-749f-4f2b-955b-fbbafd2b751c/1280x720/match/156/88/image.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "title": "Biden pushes 'made in America' plan to boost nation\u2019s economy", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-pushes-america-centric-plan-to-boost-nations-economy", "subtitle": "Joe Biden is proposing to spend $700 billion on American products and research that the presumptive Democratic nominee\u2019s presidential campaign says will bring back millions of jobs lost by an economy flattened by the coronavirus pandemic..", "keyword": "U.S.-China trade and tariffs", "website": "Fox News", "author": "Paul SteinhauserMadeleine Rivera", "content": "Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee\u00a0\u00a0is proposing spending\u00a0$700 billion on American products and research in the hopes of bringing\u00a0back millions of jobs lost by anflattened by .will formally unveil\u00a0his plan Thursday during a speech at a metal works factory in\u00a0\u00a0The plan, which also seeks to create 5 million new jobs,\u00a0is the first of four\u00a0economic proposals Biden\u2019s expected to roll out over the coming weeks.Promoting his proposals on Thursday, Biden tweeted that the nation\u2019s \u201cin the middle of an economic crisis.

Hey there Bret. Good to see you. Have a good weekend. All right, here we go. Good evening everybody. I'm Martha MacCallum and this is The Story. For the last several days, this first story tonight has been one of the most talked about controversies on Capitol Hill. It's not about the virus or about the stimulus package. It's about what one member of Congress calls an abrupt conversation and another calls a verbal assault. As Americans start to show reservations about rampant cancel culture, this harsh moment between colleagues seems to be ballooning into something bigger. Tonight, in an exclusive interview Congressman Ted Yoho is here to talk about his side of the story. Here is what Representative Ocasio-Cortez says he did to her. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ (D-NY): I was minding my own business, walking up the steps And Rep. Yoho put his finger in my face. He called me disgusting. He called me crazy. He called me out of my mind. And he called me dangerous. In front of reporters Rep. Yoho called me and I quote, (EXPLETIVE DELETED) (END VIDEO CLIP) And here is it Rep. Yoho, Republican from Florida who is not running for re-election, giving his statement on the event. Watch this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. TED YOHO (R-FL): I rise to apologize for the abrupt manner of the conversation I had with my colleague from New York. It is true that we disagree on policies and visions for America but that does not mean we should be disrespectful. Having been married for 45 years with two daughters, I'm very cognizant of my language. The offensive name-calling words attributed to me by the press were never spoken to my colleague and if they were construed that way, I apologize for their misunderstanding. I cannot apologize for my passion or for loving my God. My family and my country. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: Rep. Ocasio-Cortez has made this not about her and Mr. Yoho but she says it is much bigger than that. She says it's about our culture that is accepting of violence and violent language against women. Rep. Yoho joins us exclusively in just a moment. Also coming up tonight on The Story, we'll talk to Professor Joshua Catz who said no more to calls at Princeton to offer compensation perks based on race and much more. We'll talk about that with him in this exclusive interview that we had with him tonight. Then Victor Davis Hanson will join us on the other end of that as well. Also, tonight Congressman Eric Swalwell and Andy McCarthy on yet more breaking news on how the FBI did surveillance on the Trump team. Also, tonight, former NFL player Jack Brewer as baseball kicks off but not before the players kneeled for Black Lives Matter but we begin as promised evening with Congressman Ted Yoho. Congressman, thank you very much for joining us tonight. I know it's been a heck of a week for you and we're glad you came here tonight to sort of tell your side of the story. So it seems that what prompted this on your end at least according to what we're hearing, is that you were appalled by the comments that she made about the fact that poverty and unemployment was leading people to commit crimes. Is that what sparked you? YOHO: That was part of it. Yes. I mean but it's been a series of things. I could go into that but that was something and I just, I asked her if we could have minute of her time and ask her a question. MACCALLUM: You did? Because she said you just accosted her and she didn't know what was coming at her and then she said you called her disgusting. Did you call her disgusting? YOHO: No ma'am. I was coming down from voting from the Capitol as I walk across as I always do and I was coming up just she was coming up the stairs and I asked her, I said, Hey do you have a minute? She goes yes. And we've never had a conversation before, and I wanted to ask her about this policy that she was telling people it's OK to shoplift if you're hungry and it went backwards from there. MACCALLUM: So, did - all right, did you call her disgusting, and did you suggest that she was losing her mind? YOHO: No. MACCALLUM: Did you use those words? You never said she was disgusting? You never said she was losing her mind? YOHO: No, everything was directed at policy. When she told me that yes, she thought it was right for people to go ahead and shoplift if you're hungry, I said seriously where there's many social programs and faith-based programs and all these other food kitchens around, the best that you can do is to offer people in your district to go ahead and shoplift while you're calling at the same time to defund the police. I said those are just absolutely the most fricking, crazy policy ideas I've ever heard, and I said your policy ideas are disgusting and I turned around walked away. MACCALLUM: Now when you turned around and walked away - YOHO: And that is as long as that interaction lasted. MACCALLUM: OK, these stories are so totally different that the two of you are telling so it's kind of hard to know you know which version is the truth but when you turned around and walked down the stairs, did you refer to her as a f-word b-word. YOHO: No, I walked down the steps. I said this is just such a fricking BS and that's all I said and then a reporter came up to me and said what was that about. I said no comment. Did you say this. I said no comment and I left. You know there's another part of the story that's not being told, that she doesn't tell and I don't want to get into that because the policies that they're telling, to tell people you don't have to fund the police department, we need to defund it. I mean, it got defunded in New York, $1.5 billion and then to go out and tell people it's OK to shoplift. Well, I don't believe it's OK for the shop owner who owns that stores, trying to make a living for his family to have somebody come and say well Ms. Ocasio-Cortez says it's OK or what about the student or the child that's watching this with her mom and dad and well, I guess, I can go and shoplift mom. She said it was OK. These are the things that are tearing this country apart and it needs to stop and I can go on and on but I don't want to because I know that's not the purpose of this. These are the policies. MACCALLUM: I'm just curious. You said that she's not telling the truth about. What is that? Because you know this story, I was actually surprised at how much traction it's got but it's getting a ton of attention. People are clicking on it all the time so is there something else that we need to know about what happened between you two? YOHO: Well, I thought it was interesting like I said, I've never had a dialogue with her and I've been meaning to but with the pandemic and the way Washington's working, we're running out of time and I wanted to address this and I do this with a lot of members and I've done this with many members, questioning policies and just to try to get to where they understand. You know so we have an understanding but as I was coming back from my second vote series, I was walking back to my office and all of a sudden, I hear somebody go Ted Yoho. She yells it out. I turn around and she's pointing her finger at me, she goes Ted Yoho, I am not done with you. I'm like OK. And I mean like I said, and so I guess you see what's going on now is she's making hay out of this. She's fund raising off of this. She's out in front of the capitol wearing her COVID-19 mask playing that song boss, I'm not going to say it. Playing boss so and so. Making fun of this but yet she's on the floor, crying saying how bad this is but yet she's out there saying the same thing and you know it's disingenuous. In the meantime, I haven't said a word about this. MACCALLUM: All right so you think she's leveraging this. YOHO: I've been going. MACCALLUM: Yes. YOHO: Well, I mean - MACCALLUM: Well, you got up on the floor and you said, and you apologized. She said she didn't consider that an apologize. I'm sorry that we keep stepping on each other. We do have a little bit of a delay, but she then came back to your latest statement and she said that she didn't see what you said as an apology at all. She said if he wants to continue to lie about what happened, that's his business. They think their little man card will be taken away if they apologize for their absurd behavior. That's her most recent comment. YOHO: No. MACCALLUM: What's your reaction to that? YOHO: Well again, what is that attacking? I mean that's attacking a person's character, his manliness I guess is what she's doing and then she spun those into saying that I'm attacking all women and it was women of color. This was strictly policy and those policies are bad for this nation. I mean do you think it's right. I'm going to ask the American people. Do you think it's right to advocate shoplifting instead of going to your representative and getting help and assistance? Whether it's food stamps and I've been on this thing. MACCALLUM: It sounded to me. YOHO: I talked about that. MACCALLUM: Yes, you have. I did hear you say that. You know it sounded to me that that video that she made, got a lot of attention and it did sound like she was excusing some of that behavior. At least she was saying that she understood where she thought it was coming from and she said she wasn't talking about people getting shot in Chicago and Seattle and elsewhere. She said she was talking about small crime that came from people who were out of work but you know what I want to get to is the point that you just touched on because you said I have had similar conversations with other people about policy. Now did you get heated in those conversations. Might any of those people have thought that you were out of line in your language with them and were those people men and were those people women and did they cross the gender line? YOHO: Sure. I've had conversations with Ro Khanna, Terry Sewell, Luis Gutierrez on several things and we don't always walk away agreeing but we always wind up, it seems like afterwards laughing about things and you know we're going to disagree on that but we're always amicable. And you know I'm there to solve problems and there are many problems in this country. MACCALLUM: So she's really laying down the gender card here. Here's part of her speech which got a lot of attention. Let's play that because I want to get you to react to this. YOHO: Sure. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) OCASIO-CORTEZ: This harm that Mr. Yoho levied, tried to levy against me was not just an incident directed at me. But when you do that to any woman what Mr. Yoho did was give permission to other men to do that to his daughters. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: What do you think about that? YOHO: You know she's entitled to her opinion. That is nothing to do with our conversation. It was strictly about her policies and I went to the southwest border the week after she left. I went into the same cell she was in where she said children are being snatched away from their parents and the detainees were made to drink out of the toilet and she was cussing in front of the workers there and what I found out. They said this is a drinking fountain. This is this and so this has been a history of what she's doing and it's identity politics and I don't play that and I've got a pretty good reputation, whether it's up there or down here in my district. I practiced for almost 30 years. I'm not going to try to defend myself. I feel bad for Ms. Ocasio-Cortez who thinks this was - I called these names. I did not call her these names. This was strictly on policy and then again, I've been quiet about this. I'm not, I'm not worried about this. I can - I'm not asking anybody to defend me. I'm not going on YouTube. I'm not out in front of the Capitol playing whatever that boss something, what's that music. We've got serious problems in this nation. We've got $30 trillion in debt. I've got China breathing down our throats and I'm not going to - This is what's wrong with Washington. They'll capitalize on stuff like this and have identity politics and it's not moving this nation forward and it needs to stop. MACCALLUM: Well, you say you've had similar conversation that got heated with men and women and she clearly is trying to make this into an attack on women. She called you out and said that you weren't decent just because you have a wife and daughters so we you know, there's no doubt that she explained this to the hell and she's got a lot of support behind her from Nancy Pelosi and Ayanna Pressley and other folks who are really making this into a much broader topic. You've also got the bread for the world organization suggesting that maybe they should take you off their board. What do you say about that before I let you go? YOHO: Well, I think it's interesting and I saw the clip before this on Fox news that said I was loser of the week. You're supposed to be fair and balanced. Nobody's even talk to me and if the breadth of the almighty wants to do that, that's fine but I think it's funny how the definition of a democracy is mob rule and you're hanging somebody before you even talk to him. That's wrong and that's another thing that's wrong in this country. We need to come together. MACCALLUM: I agree with you there. YOHO: And if we can have - if we have a disagreement, let's talk about it and let's move on and we may not always agree on and I know that. I mean, I've been married for 45 years and anyways, you take care and I thank you for the opportunity to come on here. MACCALLUM: You're very welcome and we always like to hear both sides of the story. We did not call you or anyone else the loser the week. We don't do that segment here, but we also invited her to come on and talk about it as well so. YOHO: I think it was that show before you. MACCALLUM: OK, all right. Ted Yoho Representative, thank you very much and as I said, we - open invitation to Rep. Ocasio-Cortez because clearly these are very divergent stories and we would love to bring you both sides. Thank you, sir. Coming up, new documents reveal that the FBI was using candidate Trump's intelligence briefings as a place to kind of dig around for dirt in his campaign. We're going to tell you more about this when we come back. Stay with us tonight on The Story. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) MACCALLUM: Also, tonight, evidence that the FBI used an intelligence briefing to then candidate Donald Trump to kill two birds with one stone essentially. While they briefed him, they were poking around for any Russia connections that may be revealed by Mr. Trump or General Flynn. A source telling Fox news that the briefing was a \"cover.\" Agent Joe Pianka wrote in a summary, \"During ODNI briefs, writer actively listened for topics or questions regarding the Russian federation.\" Among other categories document was filed under Crossfire Hurricane and Crossfire Razor, the code names for the probes into the Trump campaign and into Michael Flynn and the document was approved by FBI officials Kevin Clinesmith who's name you may recognize from the Carter Page line of this story and Peter Strzok, of course you know of quite well. So President Trump was asked about this newest revelation last night. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: It's a terrible thing that happened. It should never happen to another president. The fact is that President Obama and Vice President Biden and the whole group of them with Brennan and Comey and McCabe and Lisa Page and Strzok, her lover and beyond them, long beyond them ,they spied on the campaign, using the intelligence agencies of our country, they illegally - this is illegal as can be, this is treason. This is many things you can call it. They spied on the campaign of another party. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: So Democratic Congressman Eric Swalwell joins me now. He is a member of the House Intelligence Committee. Congressman, good to have you with us today. REP. ERIC SWALWELL (D-CA): You too. Thanks for having me. MACCALLUM: When I listened to this and I read the documents from - from this story Peter Strzok says at one point that they should use the CI guy in the briefing, a counterintelligence person in this briefing which is supposed to be an intelligence briefing for the candidate to assess the demeanor of the individuals during that briefing. So they had a counterintelligence investigation into this back in August of 2016 based on what we learned from the Mueller investigation was no evidence that there was any connection between the campaign. So this goes back to what Bill Barr said. It's - it's not legal or ethical to spy on a presidential campaign without proper predication. What's your reaction to this new information? SWALWELL: They were right to do it and I hope they do it if a Democratic candidate ever does that with any country so Martha remember, right before this meeting occurred, candidate Trump said Russia, if you're listening, I hope you hack Hillary's emails. And what did they do? They actually did it. MACCALLUM: In front of an enormous crowd on national television. SWALWELL: That doesn't make it better, that makes it worse. That makes it worse. MACCALLUM: You think that's something sneaky and spying? Oh my gosh. SWALWELL: Yes, he wanted them to - MACCALLUM: So, the fact of the matter is that they had - there was no - SWALWELL: Let me finish Martha, let me finish. You asked my thought. MACCALLUM: There was no evidence Eric - SWALWELL: So, I'm going to tell you what I thought so Martha. MACCALLUM: - that there was any connection. No, but I was just blown away by that's your answer. OK, go ahead. SWALWELL: Like if they don't confront him, that's when we would have a problem. So one, he had just recently said that. Two, by the way, he says in the meeting, Joe, are the Russians bad? It's like yes, the Russians are bad and don't eat glue like should we even have to tell you that. Three by the way Martha, he told the country for years that he was never given this briefing and now we learned that he did which is in line with him saying he never had a Trump tower deals and Moscow extending him to do so. MACCALLUM: Yes but no, no, no. SWALWELL: He constantly lies about the Russia, that's what he does. MACCALLUM: So two things, two things. So one is just based on the facts of the story that we have - I've covered for a long time and you have also been involved in for a long time too. So President Trump was under investigation. Jim Comey said he was not. He said that to Congress under oath. So the President was indeed under investigation. SWALWELL: What would you want a counterintelligence official to do when the President is asking the Russians to hack and they're actually hacking. I hope they look into him. I hope if Joe Biden was doing this with any other foreign country that is seeking to influence our elections, that the FBI would look into it. MACCALLUM: That's fine. I'm just saying - SWALWELL: Thankfully it's not. MACCALLUM: - they have to do it properly. SWALWELL: But that's kind of their job. MACCALLUM: You have to base it on evidence and then if you - SWALWELL: And by the way two months before his son met with Russians at Trump tower. MACCALLUM: - we have the President under investigation. SWALWELL: And two months before his son met with Russians at Trump tower. MACCALLUM: So what? You're allowed to meet with Russian people. I mean this - SWALWELL: Are they our friends Martha? MACCALLUM: People meet with Russians all the time. SWALWELL: They were told that they had dirt on Hillary Clinton. MACCALLUM: I mean that meeting was thoroughly investigated and you know as well as I do that they came up with nothing from that meeting and then it's in terms of the briefing, you say that you know he said, he never received a briefing. Everybody in that room was in on the briefing except for the candidate. He's the only one who was not - no one explained to him, look Sir, you are running for president of United States, we have reason to believe that this campaign, that the Russians might be trying to find some soft spots in your team. That is what needed to be said if the concern was as great as you say but that wasn't what was going on. SWALWELL: Because he's the kind of guy that listens to intelligence briefings like he's given pictures and graphs now because he doesn't have the attention span to listen, Martha so they had a challenging job in the beginning. They have a challenging job now. MACCALLUM: So it's about the fact that he's not smart enough. I'm so confused at what you're getting at. OK. SWALWELL: Yes. Picture woman, man, camera, TV. MACCALLUM: OK fine, Congressman, thank you for being here. OK, fine, it doesn't add up to in terms of the counterintelligence investigation. All right, so let's bring in Andy McCarthy, former federal prosecutor and Fox news contributor. Andy, your thoughts on this latest revelation that came out in these documents in terms of putting in a CI person, a counterintelligence person in the middle of this briefing that is now been called a cover. ANDY MCCARTHY, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Martha, it's the same thing that happened when Director Comey used the opportunity to brief Trump after he won the election and they treated that as an investigative event, not an actual briefing. This is the same thing. It's a common tactic. You try to say provocative things in the hope that you're going to get the suspect to say things that are either incriminating or events consciousness of guilt. I just want to say two things. Number one, Trump didn't invite Russia to hack the Mrs. Clinton. In fact at that point in time, the FBI had Mrs. Clinton's servers in their possession. There was nothing to hack at that point and secondly, Trump didn't deny having this briefing. What he's denied which is true is that his campaign was never given a defensive briefing to be given some information that they may have been infiltrated by Russia. It doesn't make sense for them to have done that because Trump, I think was the main suspect but this briefing was not a defensive briefing. This briefing was an intelligence and security briefing that's commonly given to candidates for President. MACCALLUM: So given these documents, which as you say line up with a lot of what we've seen before, everyone wants to know if there's ever going to be any prosecution in any of this and everyone would like to see what the fruits of John Durham's investigation are. Are we going to see that anytime soon and what do you think based on what we're learning now? MCCARTHY: Well, they're saying the end of the summer Martha. I think you're going to get probably two things. You'll probably get some indictments in terms of like the lower level people, if this is the investigation that implicates the very highest level so being low here is relative but you know, you're talking about people who manipulated evidence, made direct misrepresentations to courts. I think they have a lot to worry about. If you're talking about an overarching scheme, where they would get the top players, I don't think you're ever going to see an indictment along those lines but I do think you'll get a narrative report about it. MACCALLUM: Yes. Andy McCarthy, always good to talk you. Thank you very much. MCCARTHY: Thanks Martha. MACCALLUM: Coming up, moving vans seen clearing out sthe China Houston consulate today after an active retaliation from the Chinese government. That's next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MACCALLUM: There is discussion that China may retaliate by asking us to leave one of the six embassies that we have in China, we also have one in Hong Kong. And it looks like Chengdu and potentially Wuhan are at the top of that list. Will we be vacating any of our embassies in China, Mr. Secretary? MIKE POMPEO, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: Martha, let's go back to first principles. And so, the Chinese government will get to make its decisions about our diplomats there inside of China. We'll make sure that we do right by the American people. (END VIDEOTAPE) MACCALLUM: One day after that from Secretary of State Mike Pompeo China is making its decision ordering the closure of the United States consulate in the southwestern city of Chengdu, a move seen as payback for Houston which was shut down this afternoon at the demand of the Trump administration. Reuters reporting tonight that men who appeared to be American officials were seen forcing open the back door with power tools and crowbars after padlocking another door. Joining me now, Dr. Michael Pillsbury, the director of Chinese strategy at Hudson Institute and the author of \"The Hundred-Year Marathon.\" Dr. Pillsbury, always good to see you. I want to start by putting up a piece of a quote, I should say from Wang Wenbin China's foreign ministry spokesperson who said, \"We urge the U.S. government to abandon the Cold War mentality and ideological basis, look at the bilateral relations correctly and stop its negative behaviors and create favorable conditions for bringing relations back on track.\" So, where are we now and what do you see in all of this, sir? MICHAEL PILLSBURY, DIRECTOR, CENTER ON CHINESE STRATEGY, HUDSON INSTITUTE: Well, the Chinese continued to deny anything wrong on their side and they deny the technology and deny mistreatment of Uyghurs. I saw a clip with the Chinese ambassador in London a few days ago saying the Uyghurs are very happy in Xinjiang in the reeducation camps. So, this is a phase we're in right now -- (CROSSTALK) MACCALLUM: (Inaudible) there. PILLSBURY: -- where President Trump and Secretary Pompeo are raising the pressure on China, but they are still not making significant concessions at all, Martha. So, things are going to get grimmer would be my forecast. MACCALLUM: So, I asked Secretary Pompeo if we're in a Cold War with China last night and he didn't choose to answer that directly. Do you believe that we are in a Cold War with China now? Closing embassies is typically one of the first stages of that. PILLSBURY: We're surely headed toward a Cold War. The Cold War term for those of us who lived through it had a nuclear dimension and a lot of nightmares like the Cuban missile crisis, military crises after military crises. It had period of detente. So, you had the Eisenhower spirit in Geneva, you had Jimmy Carter trying things differently. So, a Cold War doesn't mean really wide. It's just friction and tension. We're certainly in that situation now where Xi Jinping just doesn't seem to get the idea of the seriousness of the pressure. I might say, Martha, it's bipartisan. Joe Biden has some experience in China, has got some very hawkish advisors around him. Nancy Pelosi used to be the strongest person on human rights and civil rights in China and especially the Dalai Lama. So, there may be a temporary competition going on over the next few months of who can be tougher on China, the Biden camp or President Trump. I just point I put my money on President Trump -- (CROSSTALK) MACCALLUM: You say -- PILLSBURY: -- after the speech last night. MACCALLUM: You say that this is a new area for the president in terms of the political pressure versus the trade pressure. PILLSBURY: Yes. Yes. It's one thing to get concessions on trade. And I really admire the phase one trade deal, 95 pages, enforcement mechanism all kinds of details. That was got the hard way with terrorists. Chinese understood it and the tariffs are still on and that's a good deal the president got even though he says he's not too interested anymore. This other area, politics, democracy, human rights, there are violations at the Indian border like that, much harder to put pressure on. MACCALLUM: Dr. Michael Pillsbury, always good to see you, sir. The Story is not going anywhere. We'll talk more -- we'll talk more soon. Thank you, sir. Coming up, a Princeton University professor taking various heat for rejecting a letter that was signed by 350 of his colleagues that would base compensation at Princeton University and benefits in part based on skin color. He felt that was wrong. We're going to speak to Dr. Joshua Katz exclusively, next. And Victor Davis Hanson with his thoughts after that. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) MACCALLUM: A Princeton professor facing the wrath of his colleagues and students and the university president for refusing to sign on to a faculty letter signed by 350 members that called for radical changes to counter anti-black racism. The letter called for differing compensation levels according to race. It also called for course relief, summer salary, and one additional semester of sabbatical. It said that they should reward the invisible work done by faculty of color with course relief and summer salary, also called for additional human resources for faculty of color. So, in objection, Princeton professor Joshua Katz wrote a public Deliration of Independence right around the Fourth of July in part, writing this in part. It boggles my mind that anybody would advocate giving people extraordinarily privileged people already, let me point out, Princeton professors extra perks for no reason other than their pigmentation. Dr. Joshua Katz joins me now, professor of classics at Princeton University. Good to have you with us, Dr. Katz. Thank you for being here. So, you know, you read this document that that goes through these additional things that they wanted to give people almost as a form of -- almost as a form of reparation of, you know, sort of, way to compensate people. So, what disturbs you, what irk you so much that you decided that you were going to speak out? JOSHUA KATZ, PROFESSOR OF CLASSICS, PRINCETON UNIVERSITY: Well, I think every reasonable person of goodwill wants the world to be as just as equitable as possible. And I wrote my piece out of the conviction that my colleagues, the many colleagues who had drafted and signed this faculty letter dated July 4th seek equity and justice in misguided in ways, indeed in some ways that are illegal. So, the points that you just mentioned, for example, I said I thought were really very bad but I should have made the point much more strongly. They're in violation of title six of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. So, if you want to implement them, at least at the moment, Princeton would receive no federal funding at all. That would be very bad news. MACCALLUM: I mean, you make very -- very solid points. So why do you think there is so much support for this among all of your colleagues? Why do you think so many people decided to sign this when as you point out it clearly goes against some of the foundations of our country? And the Constitution. KATZ: Well, in my -- sure. So in my -- in my simple Declaration of Independence, I think just a bit, there were four possible reasons people might have signed, and I concentrated principally on the one that I still now some weeks later believe also on the basis of things colleagues have told me is the main one. Mainly that colleagues believe that some of the ideas in the letter are good and so therefore decided to sign on as one might call allies and not worry about the other ones. There are plenty of things in the letter that I agree with or at least believe more reasonable myself, but there are enough. MACCALLUM: Yes. KATZ: In fact, more than enough that I thought it was a mistake to sign. MACCALLUM: Yes. They talk about forming a committee that would basically decide, you know, who was racist and who isn't and what racist language, what is -- what connotes racist language. But one of the things that really got people fired up in your letter is this mention of the black justice league which you write was active on campus from 2014 to 2016 and you call it a small local terrorist organization that made life miserable for the many including many black students who did not agree with their demands. And boy, do they come at you for this from your own classics department. They said that you had heedlessly put our black colleagues, students, and alums at serious risks. Tell me about that. KATZ: Yes. Right. Well, let me start from the end. So, it's true that I'm receiving an enormous amount of heat from my own department and we're going to have to see how that plays out. The fact is however, that I have not been canceled the university has admitted that thanks to the so-called University of Chicago principles of free speech that the faculty adopted formally in 2015 I am allowed to say pretty much what I want. And so, by the way, as the president and so at least on non-departmental pages or my colleagues. So, I haven't been canceled, I have survived and that's a good reason for places that don't have the University of Chicago principles to adopt them. As for the phrase terrorist organization, I have tried to justify it. I believe I was justified in using the phrase. I understand that some people feel that I was unjustified in using the phrase. This to me is not a remarkable disagreement. People have disagreements like this all the time. The important point here is that people are focusing on this one phrase or that one paragraph and ignoring all of the demands in the letter and the things that I said about the other things. It's not that I'm not willing to defend this point, but they're seizing on -- MACCALLUM: Right. KATZ: -- a piece of rhetoric and ignoring all of the very, very large issues which I don't believe should be ignored. I don't think they think should be ignored either. MACCALLUM: Well, we're glad that you haven't been canceled for the basic fact that you should have the right to express your opinion and not be afraid or feel that it's not an environment where you can express your opinion and lay out your own arguments because that's what should be happening at universities across this country in a fair and honest exchange. So, we thank you, Dr. Katz for being here tonight. KATZ: Thank you very much for having me, Martha. MACCALLUM: So, let's bring in Victor Davis Hanson, senior fellow at Stanford University's Hoover Institution and the author of \"The Case for Trump.\" Victor, you've heard this discussion, and I know you've read about Dr. Katz's situation. What do you think first of all of the demands that this Princeton faculty made in the first place to treat people differently based on the color of their skin? VICTOR DAVIS HANSON, SENIOR FELLOW, HOOVER INSTITUTE: Well, as Professor Kat said, they're illegal, you can't let a university on Orwellian principles like that. But it's a good -- it's a good example. If one -- one person and Professor Katz is a world-renowned linguist and comparative philologist. But if one person speaks out, look who he was speaking out against, Martha. The president of Princeton University is a constitutional scholar. Classics department is supposed to be devotees of Socratic proof and constitutional history and (Inaudible) and Aristotle. And they were on the wrong side morally and on the wrong side of history, much less Princeton University itself. But he spoke out and what happened? It dissolved. And that's what we are seeing now we're are reaching peak Jacobinism. And by that, I mean, that Professor Pinker of Harvard spoke out. The Wall Street Journal just recently said we are not going to involve ourselves in this ridiculous cancel culture. Then we had Bari Weiss at the New York Times, the Harper's letter, Goya failed boycott. We had A&E losing half of its audience because one show was canceled. I think what we're seeing is that we are reaching the peak of this and it sort of a bluster and it's like a big helium balloon that it takes one fair-minded brave scholar like Professor Pinker or Professor Katz to put a hole in it and remind everybody that this is sort of like the Salem witch trials or the 1793 reign of terror in France. That it's some period of mass insanity and mass hysteria and if you stand up to it, it will pass and restore, you know, restore calm and sanity of the country. But you have to stand up to it. If you don't, and you grabble and you apologize you just feed this monster. MACCALLUM: Great point as always. And you know, you have to feel bad for the people who get caught up in that peak moment -- HANSON: Yes. MACCALLUM: -- because usually cooler heads eventually prevail. And I think all the examples that you gave -- HANSON: They do. MACCALLUM: -- are a point to the fact that that's starting to happen. Victor Davis Hanson, sir, always good to see you. Thank you so much. So, days after the NBA unveiled black lives matter on their basketball courts, professional baseball players last night got back to the game and they kneeled in support of the movement as well, praise -- raising the debate about whether political statement are appropriate and are fair game in sports. Jack Brewer when The Story continues. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) MACCALLUM: As professional sports begin again and hurray for that on this Friday evening, many leagues and teams are out with the bolden brace of the Black Lives Matter movement as they get back on the field in the court. The NBA this week made a statement on its games court -- on its game court and then at the home opener Thursday night of the Yankees and the Nationals players took a knee in tribute to the Black Lives Matter movement. Similar gestures took place at the Giants and Dodgers game except for one player which got a lot of attention. San Francisco Giants pitcher, Sam Coonrod refused to kneel and he said this was why. He says I'm a Christian. I can't kneel before anything besides God. I can't get on board with a couple of things that I've read about Black Lives Matter. How they leaned towards Marxism and they've said some negative things about the nuclear family. I just can get on board with that. That from the Giants pitcher. Joining me now is Jack Brewer, a former professional football player and CEO of the Brewer Group. Jack, always good to have you with us. Thanks for joining us tonight. JACK BREWER, CEO, THE BREWER GROUP INC.: Good to be back. MACCALLUM: So, what goes through your mind as you see these symbols on the NBA court and then also the long line, I mean, I remember when this kneeling action started it was Colin Kaepernick alone. But now it will be probably close to everyone I would imagine. BREWER: It really is, you know, for me, I get saddened when I see it. I see, you know, a culture that's kneeling down for black lives matter when their doctrine is antifamily. Their doctrine is antichrist. This is an antichrist movement. If you look, you know, they are promoting our sexual morality issues that go completely against the bible. It's like and these folks are kneeling to this movement and not kneeling for God. You know, you remove God from every portion of our society. And it's time for athletes to start stepping up for religion and for our religious freedoms and the things that are really affecting our communities. You know, we have a spiritual war going on in our country and for Black Lives Matter to hijack that word. Black Lives Matter, yes, they should matter to everybody. But the actual organization is representing the things that are across our society, antifamily, when fatherlessness is running rapid in our country and the people that we see in our streets, the folks that are locked up. You are six times more likely to live in poverty if you don't have a father. You're 20 times more likely to go to prison if you don't have a father. The same people that are having the run-ins with the law enforcement officers are fatherless. And this, this organization, Black Lives Matter in their doctrine in their mission statement says they are against the patriarch system. The bible calls for patriarchy. The bible calls for us to have sexual morality not sexual immorality. This has to end and it's time for athletes across America to stand up for what's right, what's right in the word of God and stop letting this shame, the shaming and this cancel culture completely destroy our nation. Enough is enough. Our kids are dying in the streets every weekend. MACCALLUM: I can't imagine anyone could say it better than you just did and it would be so great to see a lot more activism aimed at what you're talking about in terms of keeping families together and the importance of fathers and what a difference they make in the success ability for the kids educationally and in life. This is Lou Holtz. I spoke with him for my podcast. Just listen to what he said when I asked him about this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LOU HOLTZ, FORMER COLLEGE FOOTBALL COACH: When I look at the sporting event I looked to be entertained and I look at competitiveness and not to get a political message or something else. Don't tell me what I should believe, how I should say, et cetera. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: I mean, it is. It's divisive if you look at that picture standing there, so it, you know, forces this conversation between players in the place where it would be kind of nice to leave all of that aside, I think everybody needs a little bit of an escape from everything that's going on right now. BREWER: Yes, you're so right. I mean, think about sports should be reuniting us. And now you're seeing it divide our nation. And it's just not right. MACCALLUM: Yes. BREWER: Major League Baseball is America's game and we got to get back to that unity one blood, one nation in Jesus Christ's name. MACCALLUM: All right. Jack, I got to jump in, we're going to get off. Thank you very much, Jack Brewer. We're going to be right -- (COMMERCIAL BREAK) MACCALLUM: That is The Story of Friday, July 24th, 2020.

This dynamic is likely greater now than in 2016 given the McCarthyite atmosphere progressives have created in which supporting Trump can be hazardous to one\u2019s social standing, career\u00a0and even physical safety., the presidential campaign hasn\u2019t really started yet. This may come as news to people who follow politics and for whom it seems the 2016 campaign never really ended. But most Americans simply don\u2019t pay serious attention to the campaign until after Labor Day., the biggest issue in the campaign will be jobs and economy. Biden and most other Democrats are on the side of keeping the economy and schools closed. He has also endorsed massive tax hikes, which most voters understand will kills jobs and the economic recovery.Trump, in contrast, has urged reopening businesses and schools and arranged for the mass production of coronavirus vaccines so they are available right when they are approved, hopefully beginning in October. Plus Trump, unlike Biden, already has one economic boom under his belt., the new coalition Trump assembled in 2016 remains intact. His breakthrough was attracting lower-income voters who previously voted Democrat but felt betrayed by the elite. He also energized conservatives with promises to appoint constitutionalist judges.As a result, Trump flipped traditionally Democratic Pennsylvania, Michigan\u00a0and Wisconsin to the Republican column and held swing states like Ohio and Florida. No part of the this coalition has soured on Trump. Democrat-run cities in chaos may also help him win back the suburbs., Trump is tough on China and Biden is not. Americans are well aware that the virus that has cut short nearly 150,000 American lives came from China, abetted by the malfeasance of the ruling Chinese Communist Party. Trump has raised tariffs on more than half of goods from China and reoriented the U.S. military to deter China as its primary mission.Joe Biden was second in command of an administration that appeased China and mistreated key allies like Taiwan. He opposes Trump\u2019s tariffs on China. His son mysteriously raised large sums of money from China and Biden himself was the chief advocate of letting China in to the World Trade Organization \u2014\u00a0the key enabling step of robbing America of industry and crushing the middle class., the Trump campaign organization finally has its game on. A rule of thumb is that campaigns run by wannabe celebrity managers are likely to lose. By installing Bill Stepien as campaign manager last week, Trump has the opposite of this type of person running his reelection effort. The campaign is ahead of Biden in fundraising, and just this week raised an unprecedented $20 million in a single virtual event that drew 300,000 donors who gave an average of $67.Biden remains largely sequestered in his basement, avoiding most media. The Democrats have all but canceled their convention, opting for a mostly digital confab. In contrast, Trump will accept his party\u2019s nomination on Aug.\u00a027\u00a0before thousands of cheering Republican delegates in Jacksonville, Fla., marking the real beginning of the campaign and a likely string of high energy rallies.Biden, whose campaign and debate performances were pathetic before panicked Democrats coalesced behind him to deprive Bernie Sanders of the nomination, cannot match this performance., the Democrats have gone nuts. While the media loves to spotlight any disapproval of Trump by a fellow Republican, the real political crisis in America in on the Left. Centrist, economic liberals are being shouted down and defeated in primaries by far-left woke activists who support the Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez wing of the party and cancel culture.The British Labour Party underwent a similar transformation to the woke Left before being nearly annihilated at polls last December. Americans aren\u2019t any more likely than Brits to want to be governed by elitists who in our country falsely accuse them of racism, side with the Antifa-Black Lives Matter mob against cops, and nod at those attempting to censor or fire Americans who defend meritocracy against the racial obsession and cancel culture that now dominates the Left.Lacking moral courage, many congressional Republicans have been slow to defend against this threat to freedom. Trump doesn\u2019t have that problem, and since his July 3rd speech at Mount Rushmore, in which he defended American history, has made it clear he is the bodyguard Americans need to stop the woke mob.As in 2016, Donald Trump in 2020 and the political and economic factors afoot defy conventional analysis. But they are similar enough to forecast a second Trump term.", "comment": "(783)", "topic": "OPINION", "date": " July 22"}, {"cover": "https://a57.foxnews.com/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/694940094001/11a65d5f-f6ce-4b56-8403-b0e419935747/02f89279-7ae5-47a3-b04b-06e45839c581/1280x720/match/156/88/image.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "title": "Richmond mayor orders Confederate statues on city land removed", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/transcript/richmond-mayor-orders-confederate-statues-on-city-land-removed", "subtitle": "Jul 1, 2020 ...

Good evening, welcome to Washington. I'm Bret Baier. Breaking tonight, President Trump dismisses the stories about intelligence assessments that Russia offered bounties for killing American troops in Afghanistan as a hoax and made up to hurt him and the Republican Party. The President's National Security Adviser is saying today he had a list of retaliatory options if the intelligence had been corroborated. I will ask Secretary of State Mike Pompeo about this story, many other topics around the world in just a few minutes. But first to the lead story from the White House tonight, we begin tonight with Correspondent Kristin Fisher live on the North Lawn. Good evening, Kristin. KRISTIN FISHER, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT: Good evening, Bret. Today for the first time since The New York Times broke the story on Friday, President Trump talked about it on camera and he said if Russia did offer bounties to kill U.S. troops in Afghanistan, he would take action. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I agree with the intelligence people. I think frankly that many of the intelligence people didn't think it was something that even happened. And if it did happen, the Russians would hear about it, and anybody else would hear about it that was involved. FISHER: Today the National Security Adviser confirmed that the intelligence behind to these Russian bounties was shared with U.S. allies. And he pinned the responsibility for the decision to not share that intelligence with President Trump on the President's daily briefer, a career CIA officer. ROBERT O'BRIEN, NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER: She made that decision because she didn't have confidence in the intelligence that came up. She made that call and you know what? I think she made the right call. FISHER: But Democrats disagree. They believe intelligence of this magnitude should have made its way to the president. (INAUDIBLE) as The New York Times and associated press recording, then Democratic Senator Joe Manchin says, not only did the president, quote, fail our service members, but he broke his oath to protect and defend the constitution. It would be unconscionable to think he did not immediately inform Putin that America would retaliate in the most damning way possible. The New York Times is now claiming to have found the money trail behind these bounties to kill U.S. troops in Afghanistan. The paper reports, American officials intercepted electronic data showing large financial transfers from a bank account controlled by Russia's military intelligence agency to a Taliban-linked account. But Defense Secretary Mark Esper says, the Pentagon has no corroborating evidence at this time. Adding, I want to assure all of our service members that we take seriously any and all potential threats against U.S. military personnel. Today, Democratic Senator Bob Menendez introduced an amendment to the Defense Authorization Act to sanction Russian President Vladimir Putin and other top government officials. But the Kremlin calls the claims total B.S. and so does President Trump. TRUMP: I think it's a hoax by the newspapers and the Democrats. (END VIDEOTAPE) FISHER: Now lawmakers from both parties have been calling for a briefing about all of this from people within the intelligence community, not the White House. And tomorrow morning, the Gang of Eight is going to get one from the director of National Intelligence and the director of the CIA, Bret. BAIER: Yes, and the Secretary of State with us in just a moment. Kristin, thank you. The House of Representatives passed a bill to sanction China over their new national security law for Hong Kong. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi saying the purpose of that law is to frighten and suppress peaceful demonstrators demanding freedom. Thousands of protesters defied the law and tear gas on the anniversary of the former British colonies handover to Chinese rule. Hong Kong police responded with the first arrests under the new law. Correspondent Benjamin Hall is following this story from London. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BENJAMIN HALL, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT: Hong Kong police cracked down today both on protesters and free speech. Police fired rubber bullets as they enforce the new security law which gives sweeping powers to China to arrest people for criticizing the government. As crowds marks 23 years since the end of British rule, police held up signs warning of the new law then arrested people who called for Hong Kong independence, or even displayed the British flag. The law is applied to nonresidents and those abroad, meaning it could affect Americans. Carrie Lam, the Chief Executive of Hong Kong tried to defend it. CARRIE LAM, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF HONG KONG: The purpose of this piece of legislation is not just to punish, but it's also to deter. HALL: The U.S. is responding by moving to end special trade terms with Hong Kong and banning defense exports. With Congress moving to impose sanctions on Chinese officials who try to repress political freedoms. The U.K. is extending residency rights and citizenship to up to three million Hong Kongers. And British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has condemned the law. BORIS JOHNSON, PRIME MINISTER OF THE UNITED KINGDOM: It violates Hong Kong's high degree of autonomy and is in direct conflict with Hong Kong basic law. The laws also threatens the freedoms and rights protected by the joint declaration. HALL: The new law is punishable by up to life in Chinese prison. And China will now be allowed to establish security officers in Hong Kong, which means Chinese security forces operating freely on the island. (END VIDEOTAPE) HALL: Observe this note, this new law is a violation of the agreement made with Britain. Effectively the end of the one country, two-systems framework. The end of Hong Kong's autonomy, Bret. BAIER: Benjamin Hall in London. Benjamin, thank you. Federal authorities seized tons of products suspected to be made out of human hair taken from people locked inside Chinese internment camp. U.S. Customs and Border Protection says the goods represent a serious human rights violation. State Department Correspondent Rich Edson has an exclusive television report. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) RICH EDSON, FOX NEWS CHANNEL STATE DEPARTMENT CORRESPONDENT: In this nearly 13-ton shipment seized in New York, hair weaves and extensions from China. The U.S. officials suspect they're made from human hair. Customs official say they're still analyzing the origins of this cargo, though intercepted it based on information indicating prison labor in Xinjiang, China produced it. KEN CUCCINELLI, ACTING DEPUTY SECRETARY, DHS: It is our intention to keep interdicting shipments like the one you saw today in New York that CBP grabbed. We will keep doing that over and over and over. No American wants to buy a product that they find out later was made with slave labor. EDSON: The spokesman for the National Security Council says, quote, if this highly suspicious, 13-ton shipment of human hair indeed turns out to be linked to the Uyghur concentration camps, then this is a new low, even for the Chinese Communist Party. And they will have to answer to the world community for their actions. Officials say the administration is expanding pressure on businesses operating in the United States, urging them to rid their supply chains of products manufactured with forced labor. The federal government has issued an advisory to companies, warning them to monitor their activities in China. MIKE POMPEO, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: CEOs should read this notice closely and be aware of the reputational, economic and legal risks of supporting such assaults on human dignity. EDSON: The notice specifically references Xinjiang, China where officials say the Chinese government has interned more than one million Muslims and minorities like Uyghurs. Subjecting them to surveillance, indoctrination, and forced labor. Last month, President Trump told Axios he held off on sanctioning Chinese officials involved with the Xinjiang mass detention camps because it would have interfered with his trade deal with China. (END VIDEOTAPE) EDSON: But the president has also signed a law directing sanctions against Chinese government officials who were involved in the mass internment camps in Xinjiang. U.S. officials say that Chinese government has located hundreds of thousands of prisoners from those camps to factories across China, Bret. BAIER: Rich Edson live from the state department. Rich, thank you. For more on China, Hong Kong and America's role in the world, joining me now Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Mr. Secretary, thanks for being here. POMPEO: Bret, thanks for having me on this evening. Great to be with you again. BAIER: We just heard you talked about the companies -- American companies warning them to keep forced labor, labor out of their supply chains pointing directly at China and these concentration camps as descried by the Defense Department. Will we see investigations and prosecutions of American businesses who don't heed this warning? POMPEO: Bret, President Trump has been very clear, the way previous administrations have dealt with the Chinese Communist Party by turning the other cheek and letting them abuse America is not going to continue, so we responded across a number of fronts. So you identify one, this forced labor, nobody wants to buy products -- cheap products that were made with slave labor in Western China. They want clarity about the tracing of the product that they have. And so we've asked every business to evaluate their supply chain and make sure that nothing like that ever gets in, and we put them on notice for actions that we may take as we move forward. BAIER: You know, last month, President Trump told Axios that he held off sanctions -- sanctioning Chinese officials involved with the mass detention camps because it would have interfered with his trade deal with China. Should those have been separated? POMPEO: Bret, I've been Secretary of State for 2-1/2 years, no, there's always complex tradeoffs that one has to make. President Trump's been very clear when he signed this bill, the Uyghur bill last week that we were going to take this seriously, we were going to deal with it, we were going to put harsh restrictions in place, we're working on that. No country has responded in the same way that we have. We hope the whole world will join. What's going on there Bret, is historic, there's forced sterilization, forcing women to have abortions, this is a place with some of the most fundamental violations of human rights that the world has seen in an awfully long time. President Trump's been serious about making sure the world sees. And so we hope that countries all across the world, including Muslim countries in the world will see their way clear to putting their shoulder to the grindstone to help resolve this problem as well. BAIER: I guess the question is should the president had done more in a lot of opportunities talking with President Xi? POMPEO: There's no country that has done more, and I'm confident will do more, Bret. BAIER: All right, in Hong Kong, you -- we did a story there about the new security law in place. You've certified that Hong Kong is no longer sufficiently autonomous. Again, should the administration have acted more forcefully to deter Chinese crackdown in Hong Kong? POMPEO: I'll tell you, Bret, I wish previous administration had taken China seriously. It's true, well, this isn't partisan, 40 years of failed American policy with respect to China. This administration is trying to clean it up, trying to get it right. Now the Chinese have taken advantage of us -- advantage of us in multiple ways. We've done really good work, important work trying to protect the freedoms of the people of Hong Kong. General Secretary Xi has chosen to go a different direction, and we're responding in a way that will put pressure on Beijing, and try to maintain whatever we can of the remaining freedoms in Hong Kong. I will tell you the notion that the remains, one country and two systems is fundamentally at odds with the facts on the ground today. I regret that. BAIER: You know that your critics including now John Bolton say that this is all about election politics and to get China to buy soybeans and places that affect reelection. POMPEO: Nonsense. BAIER: OK, that's what we get from that. What does success look like with China, the U.S. and China? What does it look like? Can China be a responsible partner with President Xi at the helm in the Chinese Communist Party? POMPEO: Look, that's up to the Chinese Communist Party, that's their decision to make. What the United States can control is what we do. When there's unfair and nonreciprocal trade, we're going to demand by -- demand that it be right. When they don't do, we're going to do things like placing tariffs on their goods. When they engage in behavior that's militarily threatening to the United States, we're going to put $700 billion into our Department of Defense to keep Americans safe and secure. And when the Chinese engage in cyber espionage, we're going to impose penalties on them so that they will be deterred from doing that. Those are the things we can do. We are hopeful, we want the Chinese people to be successful. The Chinese Communist Party today has made a decision, it wants to be an imperialist power, it wants to be authoritarian in nature and it wants to compete across the world in ways they are consistent with the good things happening for the American people. And frankly, people with democracies all across the world. Presidents Trump's policies are aimed squarely at reversing that. BAIER: I want to spend some time on the Russia bounty story in Afghanistan. First, does the Russian government have American blood on its hands in Afghanistan? POMPEO: Bret, I don't want to get into the intelligence. The intelligence community has put out two statements. I used to have that job; I'm going to -- I'm going to honor what they said. Here's what I can say with absolute certainty, the United States has responded appropriately to the threats that have been presented to it in Afghanistan consistently during my entire 3-1/2 half years. First the CIA director and now as Secretary of State, there are many folks using the Taliban or who have used the Taliban over years and years and years as proxy forces. There's been money funneled in there from all across the world, unfortunately. President Trump has taken this seriously, we are hopeful, we'll make progress on our peace and reconciliation plan. And we will respond to any threat, whether that's Iranians using the Taliban or the Russians, we'll make sure they know. The Russians have been providing weapons to the Taliban for an awful lot of years, and so, this is an ongoing challenge we have. And our forces on the ground under General Miller and the resolute support mission are deeply aware of the threat from the Taliban whether that's supported by any third party or none. BAIER: But you know, you just referenced you were CIA director, there's not often consensus across the intelligence community on Intel. And if it dealt with bounties killing American troops, shouldn't the president have been told about it? We know that it was discussed in the National Security Council, the principles and deck this level. You said today the key members of Congress had that Intel as well, even though there wasn't a consensus. Why wasn't the president briefed on it? POMPEO: Well, Bret, that's not actually quite right. Most intelligence that's red -- there is in fact a consensus. Almost all of the analytical product that I read every day has a consensus across the entire intelligence community. It is often the case that it is not that happens. When that happens, we need to make sure we get it right. But Bret you know this, every morning I wake up, and I read the intelligence materials. And when I read them, there are people all across the world who are threatened, including my officers and embassies all across the world. We don't always make sure that gets to the president, we do the right thing. We make sure the ambassador on the ground knows, that the commander on the ground knows, that our allies who may be threatened as well know. It is the tactical and operational response to keep our soldiers safe and secure that is most important. When the intelligence community feels like something rises to the level of needs to get to the president, I'm very confident they will consistently present it to them. I know that when I was the CIA director, I did that. BAIER: Did you know about this particular Intel piece? POMPEO: You know, I don't want to talk about the Intel in particular on this, Bret. BAIER: All right. POMPEO: I mean, there's just -- I just -- I'm not trying to be clever, there's just so much that has been reported that is not accurate and that is incomplete that by refuting any particular element of it. I'm putting at risk our capacity to actually resolve and figure out what's going on. BAIER: And I want to ask you about that in the leak itself, but here is what the democratic nominee is saying about it. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: He either reads and/or gets briefed on important issues and he forgets it, or he doesn't think it's necessary that he need to know it. He should have a minimum, have picked up the phone and said, Vladimir, old buddy, if any of this is true, and it doesn't cease amigo, you've got a big problem. (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: All right, so, it's not just the Democrats, obviously, you have Senator Chuck Grassley on the Senate floor, saying it demands a serious response. You have two key Republicans in the House. Mike McCaul and Adam Kinzinger, saying, \"There are already those who are politicizing this issue. However, we cannot use let politics overshadow the truth that Republicans and Democrats alike can agree on: The Putin regime cannot be trusted. If the intelligence review process verifies the report, we strongly encourage the administration to take swift and serious action to hold the Putin regime accountable.\" POMPEO: Yes. Bret, there's been no administration to hold the Russians accountable the way this one has. I only wish former Vice President Biden had held the Russians accountable. We've been cleaning up a lot less of a mess. I wish we provided arms to the Ukrainians, I wish he had gotten out of the INF Treaty, I wish he hadn't allowed and invited the Syrians -- the Russians into Syria. I could go on, but you got a short show. The failures of previous administration allowed the Russians a lot of space to move. We've pushed back, we sanctioned more Russians than any other administration in history. I'll take a backseat to no one with respect to what our administration and President Trump has done to hold Vladimir Putin accountable when he is engaged in malign activity. And should we find out that there's evidence that he's putting our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines at risk, anywhere in the world, including in Afghanistan, I am very confident that President Trump will direct me, and he himself will respond appropriately. BAIER: How damaging was this leak? You were CIA Director, the White House press secretary the other day, said that there were rogue officers in the intelligence community who want to undercut the president. You believe that? POMPEO: Bret, I don't know where this leak came from. But when periodicals report this information, it breaks my heart because it puts our intelligence officers and our military men and women at risk. It is -- it is dangerous, it is unlawful, and I hope that we can figure out who did it, and they'll be brought to justice. BAIER: Mr. Secretary, you did speak out when it was alleged that Iran was paying the Taliban $1,000 for each American killed in Afghanistan, as a member of Congress, and you, spoke out about the Obama administration's response at the time, which obviously you criticize in the overall Iran deal. POMPEO: Yes, it's absolutely true. I've spoken about the Iranians providing assistance to the Taliban in my current role as secretary of state as well. I've criticized other governments. We've worked to make sure Pakistan wasn't providing safe haven for the Taliban in Afghanistan too. No, where equal opportunity when it comes to making sure we protect the Americans wherever they're serving. BAIER: All right, let's talk about the couple of other substantive things. One, as you mentioned, the Taliban peace deal. You said that the Taliban would publicly renounce al-Qaeda. You talked about that, I asked you about it back in March. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: It says it will not allow any of its members or other individuals or groups, including al-Qaeda to use the soil of Afghanistan to threaten the security of the United States and its allies. But that's not really a break. That's not a renouncing -- POMPEO: Oh, yes. Oh, yes. BAIER: A renouncing of al-Qaeda? POMPEO: Absolutely. Absolutely, when you say you're not going to let them operate there, you know it, Bret. They've done it for 20 years. They're not going to let them operate it anymore. That's -- that is a central provision. (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: You went further saying that they would eventually take up arms and fight al-Qaeda, working alongside us to destroy al-Qaeda. Have you seen any indication that the Taliban is doing any of that? POMPEO: Yes. BAIER: How? POMPEO: But I can't talk about the things that I have seen, but know this, I spoke with the Taliban, again, just this week and effort to further the peace negotiations to try and get them to the table with the Afghan government. I think we're closer than we were even just a couple of weeks back. The Taliban continued to have pressed upon them the importance of this break from al-Qaeda, and I think we will be able to see when we get to that point, when we have these negotiations commenced, I think the world will be able to see that the Taliban are no longer going to tolerate what they've permitted to happen and that the Pakistanis too will do the things that need to be done to reduce the footprint from al-Qaeda. Remember, Bret, we're down to a couple of 100 active al-Qaeda fighters inside of Afghanistan. The reason we went there in 2001 was to crush al- Qaeda. That has largely been achieved. BAIER: Can you confidently state that America will have U.S. troops in Afghanistan on Election Day? POMPEO: President will ultimately make that decision, Bret. BAIER: OK. One more thing, the E.U. blocking travelers from the U.S. due to the coronavirus pandemic. Your reaction to that, and is there any pushback from the U.S.? POMPEO: Well, remember, we're not allowing Europeans to come here today, either, Bret. We're in close conversation with countries all around the world, including European countries, to make sure that when we reopen our country to travel from their nations. That we do so in a way that keeps American people safer and reduces risk from COVID here in the United States. They have a responsibility to do that for their nations as well. And I'm very confident that we'll get this right with countries all across the world. It's not just the Europeans, we need to get this right, we need to get the economy back up, when you get people traveling all across to the United States, and international travel as well. BAIER: Mr. Secretary, we appreciate your time. POMPEO: Thank you, Bret. BAIER: Happy Independence Day, early. POMPEO: Thank you. Happy Fourth of July to you too, Bret. BAIER: All right, all the best. Up next, California and New York become the latest states to halt the process of reopening. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BAIER: Private payroll processor ADP, found U.S. companies added nearly 2.4 million jobs in June, with small businesses reporting the biggest increase. According to the data, the economy still has about 14 million fewer jobs than it did in February. President Trump is back in more stimulus as part of the recovery from coronavirus, telling Fox Business, he is not -- he not only favors more payments to individuals, but he wants them to be even larger than the first time around. Stocks started the third quarter of 2020 on a mixed note. The Dow dropped 78. The S&P 500 gained 16, and a record high closed for the NASDAQ which finished ahead 96. Here in Washington, the Fourth of July fireworks show will go on with the Trump administration promising one of the largest displays ever. 300 000 masks will be given away on the National Mall. But attendees will not be required to wear them. Other states are pausing the reopening process and mandating masks. Correspondent Jonathan Serrie, looks at the coronavirus trends across the country. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JONATHAN SERRIE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Alarmed by an increase in coronavirus cases, California's governor has announced a three-week closure of bars and restaurant dining rooms. While the mayor of New York City has postponed plans to reopen in restaurant dining. BILL DE BLASIO, MAYOR OF NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK: The news we have gotten from around the country gets worse and worse all the time. SERRIE: Public health officials say large Memorial Day gatherings and complacency over the use of face masks are driving the nation's new spike in COVID-19 cases. Today, an emergency order in Savannah, Georgia, imposed a $500 fine on people who failed to wear face coverings in public. Doctors at Emory University, say mandates are more effective than recommendations based on their own experience in hospitals. JONATHAN LEWIN, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, EMORY HEALTHCARE: When we simply strongly encouraged face masks, we still saw community spread. When we required masks, we saw our infection rates within our workforce plummet. SERRIE: Following a lot of criticism today, President Trump, explained he usually doesn't wear a mask because people who visit the president are tested. DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: If I were in a tight situation with people, I would absolutely be -- (CROSSTALK) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Do you think the public will see that at some point? TRUMP: I mean, I'd have no problem. Actually, I had a mask and I said I like the way I looked. SERRIE: Although the U.S. leads the world and confirm COVID-19 cases, its deaths per 100,000 population remain among the lowest. However, health experts say that's not reason for complacency. DR. CARLOS DEL RIO, PROFESSOR OF MEDICINE, EMORY UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE: I worry less about the numbers right now, and I worry more about the trend. And the fact that we're seeing an exponential growth is really what bothers me right now, and what really makes me very concerned. (END VIDEOTAPE) SERRIE: Public health officials are especially concerned about the upcoming Fourth of July holiday when many people are planning get-togethers, they're urging people to limit the size of gatherings, and to wear face coverings when social distancing is not possible. Bret. BAIER: Jonathan Serrie in Atlanta. Jonathan, thank you. Up next, the end of the chop zone in Seattle and budget cuts for the NYPD. First, here is what some of our Fox affiliates around the country are covering tonight. FOX 4 in Kansas City, where you, the American taxpayer have an almost 30 percent stake in a trucking company that ships military equipment. The Treasury Department will loan YRC worldwide $700 million in exchange for a stake in the company. Congress gave permission to the deal as a way to ensure taxpayer money is not misspent. FOX 7 in Austin, Texas where the U.S. army says partial human remains have been found close to the Leon River in Bell County. In the search for missing Fort Hood soldier Vanessa Guillen. 20-year-old Guillen was last seen on April 22nd, a family attorney says one suspect committed suicide as police closed in on them. Another suspect is in custody. And this is a live look at San Francisco from our affiliate FOX 2 out there. One of the big stories there tonight. Police, say they will stop making mug shots publicly available unless the person poses a threat to the public. The police chief, says the move is part of an effort to stop perpetuating racial stereotypes and protect the presumption of innocence. That's tonight's live look \"OUTSIDE THE BELTWAY\" from SPECIAL REPORT. We'll be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BAIER: In downtown Seattle, the Capitol Hill Organized Protest zone, or CHOP, is no more. Police cleared the area after the mayor declared it an unlawful assembly following two deadly shootings in less than two weeks there. Correspondent Dan Springer reports. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DAN SPRINGER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Acting on the mayor's executive order signed overnight, police officers and FBI agents moved into the area known as CHOP just before 5:00 a.m. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We need to be clear now. If we don't clear out then we'll be forced to arrest. SPRINGER: While most peacefully left, police, some in riot gear, did arrest at least 30 people for offenses including failure to disperse, assault, and unlawful weapon possession. CARMEN BEST, SEATTLE POLICE CHIEF: What has happened here on these streets is lawless, and it's brutal, and bottom line, it is simply unacceptable. SPRINGER: Established in early June in the wake of George Floyd's death, what was initially an overwhelmingly peaceful protest soon became linked to incidents of violence. Black Lives Matter and similar groups had already pulled out, and there was now concern from both protesters and the city that CHOP's original message, a call for police reform, has been drowned out. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We're going to have to work 10 times as hard to get our message back on track. BEST: Black Lives Matter, and I too want to help propel this movement forward, but enough is enough. (END VIDEOTAPE) SPRINGER: Seattle police are back inside the east precinct which they abandoned in early June. The question now is how long they will hold and keep it from becoming of point again as protestors say the idea of CHOP isn't over yet. Bret? BAIER: Dan Springer in Seattle. Dan, thanks. Just after midnight early this morning, New York City's City Council passed the city's $88 billion budget that includes $1 billion in cuts to the NYPD. But that has not resulted in the end of Occupy City Hall protesters. Correspondent Aishah Hasnie looks at the situation in the big apple today. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: As hereby adopted as of 12:26 p.m. -- AISHAH HASNIE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: With ah historic vote, New York City leaders defunded the NYPD's $6 billion budget by close to $1 billion. The 2021 budget cuts include cutting the number of recruits in half, which would save $40 million, and a reduction on police overtime spending by $352 million. And it comes at a time when shootings are up across the city compared to this time last year. The city faces a $9 billion loss due to coronavirus, and police retirements are rising. DERMOT SHEA, NEW YORK CITY POLICE COMMISSIONER: Let's mark the date on the calendar and how long it's going to be before we'll have that conversation about New Yorkers crying out for more police. HASNIE: But some protesters outside city hall and council members feel the budget did not go far enough. They wanted to eliminate school safety officers and introduce a hiring freeze on police. JONATHAN LYKES, BLACK YOUTH PROJECT 100: We're not happy with the budget, let me be clear. We know that they political tricks. HASNIE: Mayor Bill de Blasio said he will continue to support peaceful protests, but the city needs to move forward now. Protesters, though, have a different message for their mayor. LYKES: We're coming for you. We're going to escalate tactics. We're going to be disruptive. (END VIDEOTAPE) HASNIE: And that very same organizer tells me the people in charge of organizing Occupy City Hall will leave now that the budget has passed, but they will continue to support anyone who wants to stay. Bret? BAIER: Aishah, thank you. Up next, the battle over our nation's history ahead of the holiday weekend. First, Beyond our Borders tonight. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announcing a delay in the annexation of parts of the occupied West Bank. The process was supposed to begin today, and still may take place later this month. Several thousand Palestinians peacefully marched in Gaza City to protest those plans. Russian voters approved a package of constitutional changes allowing President Vladimir Putin to serve two more terms, possibly staying in power until 2036. The weeklong vote was tarnished by reports of pressure on voters and other irregularities. Putin, who has been in power more than two decades, did not mentioning his political future during a speech Tuesday and has yet to commit to running to 2024 when his current term expires. And way Beyond our Borders, NASA astronauts replaced batteries on the outside of the International Space Station today. For every two batteries removed, a new one and improved one is installed to power the station while on the night side of the earth. The battery replacement process began in 2017 and should be completed this month. Just some of the other stories beyond our border tonight. We'll be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BAIER: In our Democracy 2020 report, Oklahoma voters narrowly approved a state constitutional amendment to expand Medicaid health coverage to tens of thousands of low-income residents. Oklahoma is the first state to amend its constitution to expand Medicaid. For other states accomplished it through ballot questions. In Colorado, five-term Congressman Scott Tipton lost his Republican primary contest to pro-gun and pro-border wall candidate Lauren Boebert. She will run in November against Diane Mitsch Bush who won the Democratic primary in the district. The Colorado Senate race, meantime, set as well. Former governor John Hickenlooper won the Democratic primary against a progressive opponent and will face Republican incumbent Senator Cory Gardner. The mayor of Richmond, Virginia, the former capital of the Confederacy, has ordered to removal of all Confederate statues standing on city land. This afternoon the of Stonewall Jackson on Richmond's Monument Avenue came down to the cheers of a surrounding crowd. The move comes at a time when the fight over Confederacy symbols takes center stage on Capitol Hill. Congressional correspondent Chad Pergram has the story. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) CHAD PERGRAM, FOX NEWS PRODUCER: Pageantry and imagery defined most Fourths of July. This holiday could ignite flashpoints around the nation's uncomfortable history. There's concern demonstrators could again try to topple controversial statues. KAYLEIGH MCENANY, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: Law and order are the building blocks to the American dream. Anarchy in our streets is unacceptable. PERGRAM: The Department of Homeland Security is deploying special teams to protect federal monuments in Portland, Oregon, and Washington, D.C. President Trump warned people his executive order to safeguard monuments is in full force. That prompted a veto threat of the Senate's annual defense bill if lawmakers stand by a plan to rename bases named after Confederates. SEN. JAMES INHOFE (R-OK), SENATE ARMED SERVICES COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN: He's serious about it. You know the president. He makes up his mind, and he does things. SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER, (D-NY) SENATE MINORITY LEADER: This is nothing but typical bluster from President Trump. At the NDAA will pass. PERGRAM: Still, this bill may not go to the president to sign until fall. SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL, (R-KY) SENATE MAJORITY LEADER: I hope the president would reconsider vetoing the entire defense bill, which includes pay raises for our troops, over a provision in there that could lead to changing the names of some of these military bases. PERGRAM: But members of the Congressional Black Caucus aren't convinced some changes are truly for racial justice, such as Mississippi's decision to mothball its flag with the Confederate emblem. SEN. BENNIE THOMPSON, (D-MS) CONGRESSIONAL BLACK CAUCUS: When SEC, NCAA, the bankers, the richest man in the state who was a Trump delegate said we need to change the flag, boom, it changed. (END VIDEOTAPE) PERGRAM: President Trump believes the culture war over monuments works politically in his favor, but Democrats think that Black Lives Matter tilts the field in their direction. That's why fights over statues and military bases represents a proxy war ahead of November. Bret? BAIER: Chad Pergram live on the Hill. Chad, thanks. Next up, the panel reacts to my interview with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and the big stories around the world, next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: Does the Russian government have American blood on its hands in Afghanistan? MIKE POMPEO, SECRETARY OF STATE: Bret, I don't want to get into the intelligence. The United States has responded appropriately to the threats that have been presented to it in Afghanistan consistently. There are many folks using the Taliban, or who have used the Taliban over years and years and years as proxy forces. I don't know where this leak came from, but when periodicals report this information, it breaks my heart, because it puts our intelligent officers and our military men and women at risk. It is dangerous, it is unlawful, and I hope that we can figure out who did it, and they'll be brought to justice. (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: Secretary of State Mike Pompeo talking about that Russia bounty story in Afghanistan. We'll start there with our panel, Ben Domenech, publisher of \"The Federalist,\" Mara Liasson, national political correspondent for National Public Radio, and Josh Holmes, former top advisor to Mitch McConnell, now president of Cavalry Consultants. Ben, thoughts on his answer, and the story overall. BEN DOMENECH, \"THE FEDERALIST\": First off, I think his answer was as clarifying as he possibly could be in this moment, which is clearly, there's a big muddle here about where this intelligence came from, why it was leaked in the way that it was, and what we are supposed to take away from this situation overall. He is correct that the Taliban has been used as a proxy force in all sorts of different ways. It does seem like this story came out in a way that would undermine the efforts of American forces to figure out what was actually going on in this scenario, and coming at the truth. But I think that that's probably going to lead to a discovery that leads to an indication that this was trying to do something that undermined the president and undermined his overall efforts in the region. BAIER: Clearly the president think so, said it on FOX Business. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, (R) PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: When you bring something into a president, and I see many, many things. And I'm sure I don't see many things that they don't think rose to the occasion. This didn't rise to the occasion. And from what I hear, and I hear it pretty good, the intelligence people, many of them didn't believe it happened at all. I think it's a hoax. I think it's a hoax by the newspapers and the Democrats. (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: Mara? MARA LIASSON, NATIONAL POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, NATIONAL PUBLIC RADIO: Yes, well, Secretary Pompeo didn't say it was a hoax. He was angry that it leaked, I understand that, but I guess the question now is, is this real or not? Did the Russians but a bounty on U.S. troops? And what does the president want to do about it, if anything? So I think that's the next chapter of this. They're going to try to find out who leaked it, that's kind of one problem. But the other one is, if it's true, what is the administration going to do? BAIER: Josh, the national security advisor spoke about the CIA briefer. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ROBERT O'BRIEN, NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER: The person who decided early on whether the president should be briefed on this in Oval intelligence briefing was his career -- senior career civil servant CIA officer. And she made that decision because she didn't have confidence in the intelligence that came up. She made that call. And you know what, I think she made the right call. (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: So there's all kinds of people speculating, did they not want to bring it to President Trump because of what he would think about it, would he tweet about it, would he talk to President Putin in some way, shape, or form about it? That's not what they're saying, Josh. JOSH HOLMES, CAVALRY CONSULTANTS: No, they're not saying that at all. What they're saying is that the CIA and the intelligence services concluded that it wasn't ready for primetime, that in fact it wasn't ready to present the president or congressional leaders, for that matter. I don't think it's difficult to see what's happening here. It was, however, determined fit to print in \"The New York Times.\" And the reason it is fit to leak to \"The New York Times\" is because it goes to this ongoing narrative that Democrats, frankly, cannot let go of, that somehow this president is preferential to Russia. We've gone through three-and-a-half years, tens of millions of dollars in investigations, conclusions definitively that that is not the case, both in terms of policy and in terms of past actions. And yet here we are again debating the same thing. I don't think there's any question in anybody's mind that if we have definitive proof that Russia had bounties on American soldiers that this president is going to act decisively to ensure that that doesn't happen, and they'll have a huge response if it does. BAIER: We mentioned the Iranian bounties on American soldiers in Afghanistan, and reaction of the Obama administration after that, Ben. DOMENECH: So I certainly think that the president would have a very robust response of this. The truth is that, as Josh indicated, we've had all of these allegations put out there, including by this current Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, who continues to engage in this ridiculous campaign where she suggests that Vladimir Putin has some of kind of thing over on the president. It's ludicrous, it's laughable. But it is a situation where I think when issues like this arise, we want to have clarity. And I think in this case, we don't really have clarity about what went on here, and we may not be able to have clarity because of the way that this story played out. BAIER: Meantime, the COVID situation, the news about the cases around the country and spikes in different states, Mara, the president speaking out that he's OK with masks. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, (R) PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I'm all for masks, I think masks are good. I would wear -- if I were in a group of people and I was close -- UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You would wear one? TRUMP: I would. I have. People have seen me wearing one. If I'm in a group of people where were not 10 feet away, but usually I'm not in that position. And everyone's tested. Because I'm the president, they get tested before they see me. But if I was in a tight situation with people, I would absolutely. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Do think the public will see that at some point? TRUMP: I'd have no problem. Actually, I had a mask on. I sort of liked the way I looked. (END VIDEO CLIP) (LAUGHTER) BAIER: Mara, listen, there are, on the serious side of this, Mara -- LIASSON: This is a new, this is -- BAIER: There's the economic guys that are looking at this saying, if you're pro-mask and you don't shut down, you could save the country a lot of GDP percentage that might go down if there's another shutdown. LIASSON: There's been some pretty studying estimates that masks help the economy, because you can go back to work with them. This is a new message from the president than the past. He suggested to the \"Wall Street Journal\" that people who wear masks are doing it to show their disapproval of him. He said to a reporter at the White House, you're wearing a mask because it's politically correct. So it sounds like the White House is changing its tune on masks. The question is, will the president start wearing one, not because he needs it to protect himself or others in the White House, but to model this behavior as something that other people should do. BAIER: And how much will he talk about COVID and be a part of the task force? There's all kinds of questions coming up with the politics. Panel, thank you so much with the secretary's interview. We'll stop there. Appreciate it. When we come back, the brighter side of things, some good news. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BAIER: Finally tonight, when life gives you lemons, you try to make lemonade, right? Well, that was the case for a five-year-old Cooper Wallweber when he heard that a volunteer firefighter was injured in a shooting at a local restaurant, he felt compelled to do something good for her. The Missouri boy got to work making and selling lemonade, raising more than $3,000 from his lemonade stand to help her out. Good job. Princess Paige Lemonade is well known in some neighborhoods around Minneapolis. Its founder, six-year-old Paige, sells lemonade in stores around the Twin Cities. The young entrepreneur donates the profits to the Ronald McDonald House for Families living near a sick child getting treatment, and sometimes Paige visits those kids who are dealing with the medical issues, and of course she shares her lemonade. So there you go, making lemonade out of lemons. Thanks for inviting us into your home tonight.

Despite those policy disagreements, Jindal continued, there are many subjects on which they agree with Trump, but their opposition to him essentially hurts their own cause:\"Yet, if they oppose the reelection of Republicans and support the elevation of [Senate Minority Leader Chuck] Schumer and [House Speaker Nancy] Pelosi, they should admit they are Democrats,\" he said.

For the first time, a Republican and Democrat are teaming up to do it, and both will be here on it. But, first, violence continues to escalate in Portland for 56 nights. And now the city is banning the police from working with federal officers. Welcome, everyone. I'm Charles Payne, in for Neil Cavuto. And this is \"Your World.\" To Dan Springer in Seattle with the very latest -- Dan. DAN SPRINGER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Yes, Charles, it was some of the worst violence yet in Portland. For several hours, hundreds of protesters battle with federal officers. And right in the middle of this was the city's mayor, Ted Wheeler. He was there for solidarity, for what he is calling or what he called last night a listening session. But when he started talking, he was shouted down with obscenity. He was called a Nazi. Someone spit at him, and he was told to resign by many people. Then he was hit with tear gas, not once, but twice. After the second guessing, his security detail, well, they got him out of the area to a sheltering in a city building nearby. Federal police were firing tear gas and flashbangs for hours, as hundreds of fireworks were shot at the federal courthouse. Arsonists also threw Molotov cocktails. They broke through a fence around the courthouse, set fires and tampered with a fire hydrant. But when asked about his tear gassing, Wheeler told a reporter that he saw nothing that would provoke that kind of response. The Department of Justice Office of Inspector General has opened a review of the conduct of the federal officers in Portland. Several lawsuits have been filed claiming civil rights abuses. But the federal agencies are pushing back, saying that three of their officers may lose their sight after getting hit in the eyes with laser beams. At least 38 officers have been doxed, their identities revealed on social media. And now the Portland City Council has passed a law banning the Portland P.D. from helping the federal officers in any way. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CHAD WOLF, ACTING U.S. SECRETARY OF HOMELAND SECURITY: It does not allow local law enforcement to coordinate or support, even in perhaps life- threatening situations, federal officers. That is dangerous. (END VIDEO CLIP) SPRINGER: Portland police did eventually declare a riot last night, but they never engaged. Not a single arrest was made -- Charles. PAYNE: Dan, thank you very much. Defund cities that defund the police, well, that's what two lawmakers, a Democrat and a Republican, are proposing. With me now, New York Democrat Congressman Anthony Brindisi, along with Pennsylvania Republican Congressman Brian Fitzpatrick. Welcome, Congressmen. Let me start with you, Congressman Brindisi. How exactly would this work? REP. ANTHONY BRINDISI (D-NY): Well, what the bill says is that, if a city moves to defund the police department, if they want to abolish the police department or significantly cut funding to a police department, then they - - that would put them at risk of losing certain federal grants. And I think we have to step back and acknowledge that our law enforcement does, by and large, very good work. Most officers serve with dignity and respect. And these are very difficult times that our country is going through right now. We should be having conversations about how we reform policing and improve relations. However, I don't think we should be doing that at the expense of cutting back at -- on things like community engagement programs, or body cameras, which hold bad actors accountable, or on training, which police need to be able to protect and serve. PAYNE: Representative Fitzpatrick, we have already seen where individual cities have already taken the initiative, New York City, a billion-dollar cut, AOC actually asking and demanding a lot more. Do you think this will be enough of a disincentive, or do we need a bigger public relations campaign? REP. BRIAN FITZPATRICK (R-PA): Well, this is all part of the whole push, Charles. I'm a career FBI agent, I spent my entire adult life in law enforcement. And my goal was to build a bipartisan coalition here in Washington, D.C., to make sure that we have a voice defending our police officers. They are under assault right now. And they need our support. Do we need to make reforms? Of course we do. And our coalition believes that that should happen. And we will do that in a responsible manner. But these calls to defund the police -- Mayor de Blasio cut $1 billion out of a $6 billion budget of the NYPD, at a time when they need more help than they ever have. We need some voices of reason. And they need to start speaking up. And that's what we're going to do. And like everything I do, we're going to do this in a bipartisan manner to make sure we get the whole country on board. PAYNE: Representative Brindisi, you have got some very powerful voices in your party, your political party. I'd be interested in a couple things, first, the kind of pushback or agreement that you're seeing and talking about behind closed doors, and also the images that we're getting out of Portland, where, clearly, elected officials are making the police and the federal law enforcement agents the bad guys. They're turning them into villains in a public relations campaign that I think is making this worse. They're emboldening those folks out there who - - it's not just a peaceful protest, not all 56 nights. BRINDISI: Yes, you're exactly correct. And I think that the point behind this legislation -- and I commend Congressman Fitzpatrick, and I'm proud to work with him on this -- is to really build a bipartisan coalition here, because, by and large, if you poll the majority of Americans, they will tell you, yes, we do have to see some reforms to policing. Yes, we have to improve relationships between police and the communities that they're charged with protecting and serving. But, by and large, the Americans on both sides, I think, are against abolishing police departments, defunding police departments. And that's what this bill is meant to address. PAYNE: All right. BRINDISI: And we're building this bipartisan coalition. I have talked to a number of members on my side of the aisle who are interested in this legislation. And we should have respect for law enforcement. As I said at the top, it's a dangerous profession. These men and women risk their lives every single day when they go out there to defend us. I have heard some of the heartbreaking stories of the officers in Portland and other cities. And it's tough right now to be a police officer. PAYNE: I want to just follow up, Representative Brindisi, about the presidential candidate for your party, Joe Biden. He hasn't used the word defund, but he has used the term redirect. Maybe it's a game of semantics. It means the same thing to me, if money is not going into the police departments, which, by the way, could use extra funding for these improvements in the training that everyone is -- everyone agrees that they should have. BRINDISI: Well, if you look at -- when you start cutting back -- and many police budgets are already under strain -- when you start cutting back, the first thing the departments will start cutting are things like community policing, community engagement programs, training, things like that, gear that is necessary for officer safety. And these are all things that are important, body cameras, that are important to help protect and improve relations between the police departments and the communities that they serve. And I'm all for investing in mental health and education. I think our officers are being asked to do way more than they have to right now. They're becoming educators, health care professionals, mental health counselors. PAYNE: Right. BRINDISI: So, they do need some help. And we do need to be making investments at the local level, the state level, and the federal level in mental health and education, but not at the expense of taking away things like community engagement programs and training for police. PAYNE: All right. Representative Fitzpatrick, what I'm concerned about, of course, is the -- is the message that's coming from very highly regarded politicians. Again, I would love to see Vice President Biden come out and not use terms like redirect, and claim it's not the same as defund. And, by the same token, the American public overwhelmingly is against this idea. So, do you think they will -- maybe we can stem the tide of this crazy notion of defunding the police? FITZPATRICK: That's exactly what we're doing down here, Charles. That's why I'm building a bipartisan coalition that, as Anthony mentioned, is growing. PAYNE: Yes. FITZPATRICK: There are a lot of people that are interested in joining this. And we will be the voice to have the backs of the men and women that serve our communities. We all see the terrible images on television. They have -- they have always had a hard job. Their job is especially hard now. PAYNE: Right. FITZPATRICK: And they need our -- they need our support, and they're going to get our support. PAYNE: It's extremely hard. And we salute both of you. It's rare we see bipartisanship, particularly on something like this. Thank you both very much. FITZPATRICK: Thank you, Charles. PAYNE: Meanwhile, folks, the question, is Washington so focus on extra unemployment checks running out, that they're ignoring the debt clock that's running up? White House Budget Director Russ Vought joins me. He's next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) PAYNE: Stocks falling on signs that a coronavirus relief push Washington may be stalling, but maybe not. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is on the Senate floor, speaking about the new push for a new bill. Let's go to Chad Pergram with the very latest -- Chad. CHAD PERGRAM, FOX NEWS SENIOR CAPITOL HILL PRODUCER: Well, this is coming right off the presses as we speak here. The Senate majority leader was expected to release a framework for this coronavirus bill this morning. That did not happen. We got nothing but radio silence. But here's what he said in just the past couple of minutes. He says he will release a framework for this bill next week. And it will include three major tenets. He says kids, jobs and health care. Now, there seems to be a lot of dissonance on the Republican side of the aisle. And the reason this is taking a long time to get together is that not all Republicans are in agreement here. And this is why Chuck Schumer, the minority leader, says that the GOP is in disarray. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY), MINORITY LEADER: They have been so divided, so disorganized, so unprepared that they have struggled to even draft a partisan proposal within their own conference. They can't come together. (END VIDEO CLIP) PERGRAM: The secretary of the Treasury, Steve Mnuchin, today announced the administration would drop its demand for a payroll tax cut. There were only about 10 Republican senators who supported that, and it would explode the deficit to the tune of hundreds of billions of dollars. Plus, there are divides about extending unemployment benefits. Republicans raised hackles back in March that some people would receive more money off the job than on. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. LISA MURKOWSKI (R-AK): And I do think that what we're trying to do is to avoid some of the unintended consequences that we saw with the full-on $600 added to every state's base unemployment. (END VIDEO CLIP) PERGRAM: Now, there's kind of an artificial deadline at the end of next week, July 31. That's when these unemployment benefits, these extra unemployment benefits expire. And Republican and Democratic senators, they have to come to an agreement if they want to have more direct payments to Americans. These are the nitty-gritty details, and the cost of those and the price tag there, that's going to be major -- Charles, back to you. PAYNE: Chad, before I let you go, the $600, there was a report out earlier, Mnuchin saying 70 percent of people's incomes. That's a big difference for a whole lot of working Americans. That's a giant gulf to navigate in a very short period of time. PERGRAM: Absolutely. And that's why we were hearing numbers of maybe just $100 or $200 there. Republicans are very concerned about the price tag. But just because they say that this is going to be the last bill, there's worry that there might be another bill sometime in the fall or the winter, if this continues to grow. PAYNE: Right. PERGRAM: And I talked about the overall cost of that payroll tax cut, which seems to be off the table right now, Charles. PAYNE: All right, Chad, thank you very much. Always appreciate it. So, how does not including a payroll tax cut in this next coronavirus release bill sit with the White House? I want to bring in right now Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought. Russ, congratulations on the job being permanent. Let's talk about some of the things we -- that was thrown out there, including this payroll -- payroll tax cut. Apparently, it will not be part of the final package. How is President Trump feeling about that? RUSSELL VOUGHT, WHITE HOUSE BUDGET DIRECTOR: Well, he's obviously disappointed that it's headed in that direction, but he wants to get a bill. We're hard at work trying to get a bill. Unfortunately, we are dealing with a recalcitrant Democrat majority that is insisting that we fund big government, as opposed to pro-growth economic policies that get this economy back in terms of the V-shaped recovery. PAYNE: Speaking of the V-shaped recovery, J.P. Morgan last week said that extra 600 bucks was the magic ingredient, that people went out and they spent that extra 600 bucks, and that's why we saw employment come back so quickly, we saw a record-breaking retail sales rebound. So, they're essentially saying, if you take that away, you really endanger the recovery. How are you feeling about that? VOUGHT: Well, I think it's important to take a step back and remember that unemployment benefits is going to go on and exist for the entirety of this year. Most states have about a year's worth of unemployment insurance. That's not going to just artificially sunset at the end of next week. What we're talking about is the additional benefit on top of that, that Congress put in place... PAYNE: Right. VOUGHT: ... that has provided a disincentive for small businesses to be able to get their workers back, because they get more money than they had previously worked for. So, we're trying to make sure we remove that disincentive, still do something to be able to extend at somewhere in the neighborhood of 70 percent, so that you're not -- it's not 100 percent of what you used to make, and be able to remove that disincentive to get people back to work working for small businesses. PAYNE: And for those who don't have a job waiting for them, but now they're only getting 70 percent of their incomes, it's a heck of a calculation that the White House and Republicans have to make on this. VOUGHT: Well, again, we're not for not doing any bill. We want to be able to continue to put people -- put money in people's pockets, continue to do -- get a bill done. We have got to get this economy continuing to be on the mend, approximating a V-shaped recovery. But we have got to do it right, Charles. And we got to make sure we remove disincentives, so that small businesses can get the workers back to work. PAYNE: What kind of -- speaking of small businesses, what other adjustments can there be for the PPP program? Eighty-five percent of the applications went to these $150,000 or less, but almost 85 percent of the money went to the bigwigs, you know, these million-dollar bailouts. That did not sit well with the general public. VOUGHT: Sure. Well, we have got money that still has not been spent, about $130 billion that can be reallocated. You know, I think, at the end of the day, the PPP program is going to be an incredibly successful program. History will speak kindly about this program. And I think the examples where it went to those that it was not intended for will be the vast minority, and that this went to diners, and small hardware stores, and small businesses across the country. PAYNE: Right. VOUGHT: And I think you're going to see history reflect very well on that important program. PAYNE: I'm inclined to believe you're 100 percent right. History is going to look kindly on the way the federal government reacted, the White House, the Federal Reserve, and programs like PPP, which -- which makes people wonder, is Mitch McConnell -- are they taking this too slow at this point? I mean, when Mitch McConnell says, kids, jobs and health care, I'm not even sure what he's talking about. But many are saying, we need to cobble something together before July 31. VOUGHT: Well, we're at -- hard at work to be able to do that. I don't think that Senate Republican leadership is in any way trying to take this slow. I think they're working very hard to get a bill that can pass. Our negotiators are hard at work doing that. On the school front, we want to make sure that we have taken the excuse for schools to open up off the table, and we want to put in policies that... PAYNE: Right. VOUGHT: ... help incentivize them to reopen. And so I think that's what we refer to when we're talking about kids. PAYNE: OK. VOUGHT: But we have got to make sure the policy gets right. And that's what we're hard at work doing. PAYNE: Yes, if kids don't go back to school, there is no economy, because so many parents can't go back to work. Russ, I want to ask you about the White House rolling back this Obama era, affinity -- Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing. It's sort of a tongue- twister known as AFFH. It came about in 2015. It was -- President Obama attached this to some of the things for HUD. Ben Carson pushed hard that this was too complicated, it was too costly. President Trump listened. And now there are howls saying that this is discriminatory and it's racist. Explain why this should have been taken out of this, out of the HUD's program. VOUGHT: Yes, it has nothing to do with racism. And it is a tongue-twister. But, basically, what you saw was a -- President Obama and Vice President Biden's war on the suburbs, where you were using the power of the federal government to bully neighborhoods and localities into changing their zoning restrictions, and to be able to reflect and deal with artificial balances, imbalances that might exist that have nothing to do with race. And what we have come along and done is to basically say, we believe you can further fair housing by providing affordable, safe, decent, nondiscriminatory housing without the federal government bullying mayors and local officials into changing their zoning restrictions to do away with single family houses. PAYNE: You know, there's a war on the single-family home. It's an ideological war. And this was part of it. I believe that the single-family home, the white picket fence -- it sounds corny, Russ -- I still think that's the American dream, and some people don't like that. Congratulations, again, and it's great having you on the show. We appreciate it. VOUGHT: Thanks, Charles. PAYNE: Well, batter up, because, baseball, it's finally opening up. The pros are ready to play. And something tells me viewers are ready to watch. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) \u00a0PAYNE: Play ball. Opening day is here, and it's just hours away. Abby Hornacek will join us on just how it's all going to go down. And we will be back in 60 seconds. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) PAYNE: Well, the first pitch of the Major League Baseball season just a little over two hours away, as players prepare for a season without fans in the stands -- well, or at least without real people. All right, want to go to Abby Hornacek, who is going to fill us in on this brave new world. (LAUGHTER) PAYNE: Now, listen, I know robots and androids are taking all of our jobs, but they're going to be the fans now, too? ABBY HORNACEK, \"PARK'D\" HOST: They're taking our spots. Yes, they're taking our spots in the stands, Charles. What is going on? (LAUGHTER) HORNACEK: No, I actually think that this is a great idea. They are experimenting with virtual fans. And, of course, it's not ideal, but I think it's our best option right now. And here is why. So, they have been talking about how they're going to pipe in these crowd noises at the games, which my first reaction was, this is going to sound like a really bad sitcom, when people are laughing in the background and there's no one actually in studio. But when you add in this augmented reality, you're putting life behind those sounds. And, Charles, I don't know about you. But when I watch a baseball game, I'm not looking at the faces of the fans, minus the times where you get that viral video of maybe a guy holding a baby and a beer, and then there's a foul ball and the ball lands in the beer. Then it matters. But I think people will get used to the fact that these are not real people. And it looks so realistic, they will forget about it altogether. PAYNE: So -- but we're not at that stage yet, though, where, say, there is a foul ball, that one of these the android-like things gets up and catches it. I mean, have they gotten that advanced yet? HORNACEK: Can that happen? PAYNE: Or will they just -- what's going to happen? (LAUGHTER) HORNACEK: Yes. You know, I'm not sure. I think that they just disappear. (CROSSTALK) HORNACEK: If they could make some form of augmented -- if they could make some form of augmented reality that could catch balls... PAYNE: What are the players saying about this? HORNACEK: So, here's the thing about the players. And I think the reaction with fans, is that OK? Well, this might be a little weird to watch on TV. I honestly don't think that the players care, because I actually watched a really interesting interview this morning with Pete Alonso. And he was saying that, look, these guys come up through the farm system. So they're not used to playing -- until they reach the majors, they're not used to playing in front of these crowds that you get at Citi Field or Yankee Stadium. So I really don't think they -- it matters -- it matters to them. They just want to play ball. And, if anything, it'll hopefully return them to the reason that they started playing baseball in the first place, for the love of the game. PAYNE: Well, all right, I hear you there. But what about the home field advantage, that energy that the home team gets from the crowd, and they're behind, and it's the bottom of the ninth? And there's something that you feel, right? I mean, no matter what sport it is, you feel it, and it seems to put teams over the top. Is that going to be gone? HORNACEK: I -- yes, I do think an aspect of that will be gone. But with this augmented reality, they're talking about that they can switch the colors of the people in the crowd. They can switch their jerseys or the colors catering to whatever team is having the home field advantage. And get this, Charles. They will make the fans leave if it's a blowout. (LAUGHTER) HORNACEK: So, people are going to be watching that on TV, but the players aren't going to be feeling that. So they're just going to have to get over it, I think. PAYNE: Yes. HORNACEK: Take it back to the little league days, you know? PAYNE: Yes. Yes. What are we looking at now? Who's the favorite? Has anything changed with respect to the who's going to win this year? Have the oddsmakers made any sort of adjustments because of all this? HORNACEK: Yes, you do see the odds changing a little bit. But I think that it -- what's going to really change it is seeing opening day and how all of this plays out and how it plays out for fans at home. Who is watching? I do think that a lot of people are eager to get back there. Sports bettors are eager to get back out there and start laying some action all these games. So I think we will see that shift. And then you have the universal designated hitter, which has been kind of a change, and only 60 games. So, each game matters more. You're not looking at a normal baseball season. PAYNE: Other sports, so we have got racing, we have got baseball, there's the NBA, everyone under the dome. That's going to be another weird experience. But there were questions of whether or not sports would continue. And it looks like we're going to make it through, right? HORNACEK: I think we are, Charles. And it's good for fans. It's good for the players. I think everyone's just eager to see something. And sports have had a universal effect on bringing people together. So, hopefully, that happens in today's climate as well. But the NBA, they're working on their bubble. And baseball is different, because there will be traveling, and there is more of a risk with getting on airplanes and all of that. But I do think we will slowly see sports coming back. NFL season is actually talking about maybe using this augmented reality... PAYNE: Right. HORNACEK: ... with their fans as well. So, baseball's definitely laying the groundwork when it comes to that stuff. PAYNE: All right, well, I want to see these -- this augmented reality crowd in the seventh inning stretch. I want to hear them singing \"Take Me Out to the Ball Game.\" Abby, thank you very much. HORNACEK: I actually -- Charles, I heard a rumor that you're actually going to be singing the seventh inning stretch, and it's going to be an augmented reality of you. (LAUGHTER) HORNACEK: So, I'm looking forward to seeing that. PAYNE: I'm working on it. You got it. See you soon. HORNACEK: Great. Great. PAYNE: You might see me tonight. HORNACEK: Thank you. Great. PAYNE: Hey, in the meantime, we know former President Barack Obama is making a big pitch for Joe Biden's run, but is he also pitching someone to run with him? We will be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) PAYNE: California Democrat Senator Kamala Harris holding a virtual campaign event for Joe Biden. Now, she is said to be on his short list for a running mate. Today, Biden also releasing his latest this pre-taped talk with Barack Obama. Could the former president be steering his former vice president towards a certain V.P. pick? Joining me now, RealClearPolitics' Phil Wegmann. Phil, apparently, I keep reading where Joe Biden is down to four black women as potential V.P. candidates. When I peruse the news further, I see more names in there. Is anyone sort of moving ahead of the pack here? PHILIP WEGMANN, REALCLEARPOLITICS: We know that Kamala Harris certainly seems interested. And there are rumors that she's actually putting out opposition research on other candidates. Those are unconfirmed at this point, but it shows how significant the stakes are. Not only would Biden's V.P. pick obviously be one heartbeat away from the presidency and possibly be his successor, but whoever he picks as a possible vice president, that's going to show us how and according to what ideology a Biden administration would govern from. So this is going to be something to keep a very close eye on, obviously, as we get closer to the Milwaukee convention. PAYNE: So, Phil, I'm looking at the names, Val Demings, Keisha Lance Bottoms, Kamala Harris, Karen Bass, Susan Rice. And I get, OK, he's going to be able to check the box black woman, but the younger part of this political party, where the energy is, the more progressive part of it, does anyone fulfill that area? Because, listen, Bernie Sanders was very close to winning this thing, if it wasn't maybe for a last-minute pushed by Clyburn. WEGMANN: No, you're absolutely right. And while Biden has said that he's going to pick a woman as his vice president, he needs to be able to put someone in that position who's going to maintain African-American support through the general election. Remember, it was black voters who brought Biden's campaign really back from the dead in South Carolina. And then the second part here, which goes to the heart of your question, is, he's got to find someone who is going to make younger voters enthusiastic. Not long ago, during the primary, a lot of millennials, a lot of younger voters were literally saying, please don't make me vote for Joe Biden. So those are two considerations that he has to take care of with whoever he picks. PAYNE: Let's throw out a third one, the enthusiasm gap. Now, of course, there's no doubt a black V.P. would energize the black vote, particularly black women, who really know how to get the entire community out to the polls. But we have seen a tremendous lack of enthusiasm for Joe Biden, and, more recently, his unfavorables have begun to skyrocket. So is there something to be said about a certain spark, a certain kind of energy that could also get more people out? Because I think that's one area that probably won't change for him. WEGMANN: And that's a reflection of the type of campaign that Joe Biden has run so far. He's been running a campaign that has been in self-isolation because of the coronavirus. I think that a vice president pick who could really energize people with newer ideas, folks on the left, that would do his campaign quite a bit of good. David Axelrod talked about this problem in a recent piece, where he pointed out that whoever Biden picks needs to be able to help him win the election, but then the larger question is, not only help him win the election, but be a lieutenant who is ready on day one to really go brawl with Republicans on Capitol Hill, because it is going to be a fight for him to get anything that he has proposed to the finish line. PAYNE: Right. Right. I mean, with this list, he doesn't get a state that he wasn't going to get anywhere and those kinds of things. Barack Obama, former President Obama, is there any -- who's he leaning towards? Is there someone that he might be out there pushing? WEGMANN: Well, we know that President Obama has kept close ties within the party. He was close to Senator Harris. And he was complimentary of a lot of the things that she did. I think that Obama is clearly a voice in Joe Biden's ear right now. He has a tremendous amount of sway. PAYNE: Right. WEGMANN: And not only is he able to sort of bring back some of the nostalgia among Democratic voters by being on stage with Joe Biden. I think that he is a powerful counsel for his former vice president. The two trust each other, and I think he's going to have a significant influence on who Biden picks. PAYNE: Next time, I want the gossip. Who's throwing who under the bus? I will let you off the hook this time. Phil, thank you very much. WEGMANN: Thank you, sir. PAYNE: All right, more cities rolling back their reopenings, as coronavirus cases keep climbing, but are these new lockdowns keeping the economy locked down? (COMMERCIAL BREAK) PAYNE: Well, you're looking live at Chicago and Baltimore, where restrictions are being reimposed tomorrow, as both cities continue to see an uptick in coronavirus cases. So, the question, of course, is, are all these rollbacks holding the economy back? I want to bring in market watcher Heather Zumarraga. Heather, today we got initial jobless claims, the first uptick after 16 straight weeks of decline. A lot of that can be attributed to the fact that many places where we saw reopenings, then they stalled, or they closed, or they reversed. Just how much havoc is this going to create with the economy? HEATHER ZUMARRAGA, FINANCIAL ANALYST: Well, I think this is already creating a lot of havoc in the economy. Now, the stock market is a completely different animal, or has been, at least. When you look at the jobs data, if there is one silver lining, it's that continuing claims have come down, still over a stunning 16 million people filing for continuing claims over and over again. But the number is coming down. And that matters more than the 52 million that originally have filed for unemployment, but not continue to do so. PAYNE: Right. And, Heather, here's the thing. We know that these start, stop, start stops, one of the thing that this V-shaped recovery needed is momentum, because it's -- against all the odds, it's done so much better. Our economy has done so much better than any expert thought it would. But now these experts are back saying, OK, now we're going to be right. Now the V-shape starts to plateau. Now we go back down. And it bothers me, because a lot of these places that are reclosing, I feel, sometimes, it's as much a political decision as a health decision. And if that's the case, they're deliberately harming the economy. ZUMARRAGA: Absolutely. But, look, it should not be political. The economy should remain open, but not at the expense of people's lives or people getting sick. But you wear a mask, like Baltimore mayor and governor of Maryland is enforcing now, and you social distance. The news that we got about the bar in Chicago closing permanently, for good, they're not alone. You're seeing businesses across the board having to shut their doors because we're shutting the economy down. According to Yelp, for example, almost 70,000 small businesses have just given up and they're saying, I can't do this anymore. And so it shouldn't be a matter of a political debate, of Democrats wanting to shut down the economy to save lives and Republicans wanting to keep it open to keep the economy going. There should be a middle common ground that we can take safe measures and cautious measures to keep the economy open. PAYNE: Well, and the realization is that, until there is a vaccine that is -- we have to learn how to coexist, even prosper, amid the virus. So, this is not a long-term option, in my mind. At some point, every state, every municipality, every city has to reopen their economies to a certain degree, or the carnage is going to be so much more than you could believe. ZUMARRAGA: Oh, yes. And I think what's important to most Americans now is not just that $600- per-week unemployment supplemental insurance that's wearing off, but what are we going to do with PPP? Democrats are all in favor of doing another round, as are most Republicans, but this time it will be targeted more towards small businesses. Secretary -- Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has said that. Those that were hit at least 50 percent by COVID will be helped to keep businesses going, and open not those big Harvard endowments or the Potbellys are the Ruth's Chris or those that may not need it. We want to help the people that were shut down due to no circumstance of their own, that this was a self-inflicted shutdown. PAYNE: Right. Heather, you mentioned the $600 additional money, the federal money on top of the typical state unemployment claims. What number should be out there? What is the ultimate number that they should agree on, understanding that a lot of that could probably immediately go back into the economy, but also pile up on the debt? It's a difficult conversation. But we do see where the markets are becoming concerned about this. And that seems to be one of the major battlegrounds between the two parties. ZUMARRAGA: Oh, absolutely. I mean, that's what the fight is about right now. What is that number going to be? Democrats want to extend the benefits at $600 per week. And Republicans are saying, how about $200, maybe $300? Or what Steven Mnuchin is saying is that we give 70 percent of your income. So you target the number to what people making before, because the biggest problem would be that you're receiving more income by staying at home than going to work. And some may deem that an insensitive comment to those that have lost their jobs, but it's really not, because in order to sustain the economy over the long run, you want people to be working and to be employed. And so you can't make more unemployed than you are when you're working. And that's why that's 70 percent of your income prior to COVID number is being looked at by the GOP. PAYNE: Do we need a deal by July 31? Some are arguing that's an artificial deadline, although we do know that's when those extended benefits expire. ZUMARRAGA: Well, if you look at Speaker Pelosi saying that we definitely need a bill by the end of the month, and Larry Kudlow is pretty optimistic. He's running Economic Council over at the White House. PAYNE: Right. ZUMARRAGA: But then you have House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy saying, oh, we might not get it by the end of the month. But I think those 52 million Americans that have filed for unemployment do want some type of extension. PAYNE: I think so too. And I think we saw the market, the Dow off over 300 points. ZUMARRAGA: Yes. PAYNE: It will down a lot more than that, putting a lot of pressure on all those folks. ZUMARRAGA: Oh, yes. PAYNE: Heather, thank you very much. Appreciate it. ZUMARRAGA: Thanks, Charles. PAYNE: All right, folks, with tensions with China flaring up, now Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is about to deliver a major speech smacking them down. Where is this showdown heading? We will be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) \u00a0PAYNE: You're looking live at the White House. President Trump is about to hold a news conference on reopening schools, among other things. When he takes the podium, we will take you there. Meanwhile, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo about to speak at the Richard Nixon Presidential Library in Yorba Linda, California, as tensions continued to rise between the United States and China. Rich Edson on what Secretary Pompeo is saying -- Rich. RICH EDSON, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Hi. Good evening, Charles. And Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is going to justify the U.S. closing the Chinese Consulate in Houston because he says it was a hub of spying and intellectual property theft. That's according to the prepared remarks for the secretary's speech that he's about to give at the Nixon Presidential Library in Yorba Linda, California. The secretary mentions President Nixon's historic 1972 visit to China and says engagement with the Chinese government has since failed to live up to the change Nixon had hoped to create. He says democracies must abandon blind engagement with China and -- quote -- \"General Secretary Xi Jinping is a true believer in a bankrupt totalitarian ideology. We can no longer ignore the fundamental political and ideological differences between our countries.\" Pompeo floats the creation of an international alliance of democracies to induce change in China's government. Just yesterday, the State Department ordered the Chinese government to vacate its consulate in Houston. China is warning the U.S. to reverse that decision, and, if not, promising to retaliate. The FBI claims China's consulate in San Francisco is protecting a Chinese researcher who prosecutors have charged with lying about her military background to get a visa to come to the United States. State Department officials say there's been a marked increase in Chinese spying activity in the United States over the past few years. And in just the past month, there has been a significant deterioration in U.S.-China relations. The United States has authorized and enacted sanctions on Chinese government officials and businesses that were involved in massive human rights abuses in Northwest Xinjiang, China, and, of course, revoking that special trading status that Hong Kong once enjoyed -- Charles. PAYNE: Rich, thank you very much. And you're looking live, as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is going to give the speech right now, this, of course, as China is threatening retaliation for the closure of its Houston consulate, while it harbors what the U.S. says is a military-linked fugitive in San Francisco. So, where's all this going? I want to go to former State Department senior adviser Christian Whiton, who joins us now. Certainly, the cold war is heating up, Christian. What's the next step? CHRISTIAN WHITON, FORMER U.S. DEPUTY SPECIAL ENVOY: Well, the next step is waiting to see what the Chinese will do. This looks like the U.S. ratcheting up tensions, but what really it is, is, frankly, just the U.S. finally getting its head in the game. President Trump throughout his administration has been tough on China, particularly on trade, trying to bring some equity and some fairness to that relationship and putting tariffs on more than half of what we import from China. But the political pushback on the criminal realm and now the diplomatic realm has been a little slower coming, but now it's coming full force. What Secretary Pompeo is going to say today really is, frankly, Reaganesque. It's language we haven't really seen this starkly from the administration, so I think a good turn. But as for the embassy -- or -- excuse me -- the consulate closure in Houston, the Chinese presumably will retaliate. PAYNE: Right. WHITON: I sort of doubt their ability to retaliate as strongly, but that's probably coming. PAYNE: So, when they said Houston consulate was a hub of spying and I.P. theft, no one's surprised, per se, and yet they keep feigning this, wow, you guys are pushing us around. And I think, to a certain extent, Christian, they get a lot of help from the U.S. media, which seems to take China's side or seems to be sympathetic that President Trump once again pushing China around. Isn't it about time we took this kind of stand? WHITON: Absolutely, it is. But, absolutely, you're right that our media, the mainstream media, is doing China's bidding. The Washington Post editor who covers east Asia yesterday said this move to close the consulate was just President Trump trying to distract from coronavirus. Well, The Washington Post actually takes money from China Daily, millions of dollars to run content from China Daily in its newspaper. That is a propaganda organ of the Chinese government. PAYNE: Right. WHITON: So, you can understand why maybe The Washington Post isn't as excited about this. But you're seeing, I think, a very strong turn in the executive branch and also on Capitol Hill, where you have bipartisan support for a tougher approach on China. And Senator James Risch, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, just introducing a new bill today that would codify a lot of what President Trump has been talking about. PAYNE: Right. Christian, it's so appropriate this is at the Richard Nixon Library. In 1972, our GDP was 900 percent higher than China's. Last year, it was 30 percent higher. All that theft has paid off big time for China, in addition to not having to live by the same trade rules as everyone else. WHITON: It has. And, if President Nixon were alive today, I think he would be in favor of reevaluating the opening of China that he commenced back in 1973. And Henry Kissinger, who is alive today and who did recently meet with President Trump, I think would also be in favor of taking a look. PAYNE: Right. WHITON: When we engaged China first, the idea was to separate from the Soviet Union. And we did. And that was effective. But we're in a very different environment today. PAYNE: Yes, a lot has changed since 1972. Christian, always appreciate it. Thank you, my friend. WHITON: Thank you, Charles. PAYNE: Hey, folks, real quick, did you see this, Lady Liberty standing tall as lightning strikes, as she is fully charging? You know what? So am I. You got to check me out every weekday 2:00 p.m. on FOX Business. You do not want to miss \"Making Money.\" It's my main job, but, sometimes, I have got to save your money as well.

I'm Dana Perino, along with Jesse Watters, Greg Gutfeld, Juan Williams, and Katie Pavlich. It is 5:00 in New York City. This is The Five. Fox News alert, President Trump getting ready to hold a news conference any moment now in the Rose Garden. We will bring it to you live once it happens. And while we wait for that, President Trump and Joe Biden squaring off over how best to bring back jobs after the pandemic damaged the economy. The former vice president trying to slice into President Trump's polling advantage on the economy, Biden quick to criticize President Trump during his speech today. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: It's gotten bad enough that even Donald Trump finally decided to wear a mask in public. I'm glad he made the shift. Mr. President, it's not enough. We won't be able to turn the corner and get American people back to work safely without presidential leadership. Mr. President, open everything now isn't a strategy for success. It's barely a slogan. Quit pushing the false choice between protecting our health and protecting our economy. All it does is endanger our recovery on both fronts. (END VIDEO CLIP) PERINO: Biden also calling for $2 trillion in new clean energy spending. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BIDEN: When Donald Trump thinks about climate change, the only word he can muster is hoax. When I think about climate change, the word I think of is jobs. Science tells us we have nine years before the damage is irreversible. We are going to make historic investments, so we will seize the opportunity and meet this moment in history. We are going to get to work delivering results right away on day one. (END VIDEO CLIP) PERINO: All right. Greg, let me ask you. A lot of that stuff in the -- when it comes to energy policy, do you feel like you could've heard that before, maybe in the previous administration? GREG GUTFELD, FOX NEWS HOST: Maybe. But it is -- Biden economically is kind of terrifying, because he's all in on the Green New Deal, including this apocalyptic nine year vision that is not based on any science but rather AOC-led hysteria. So we are handing our economy -- not over to Joe Biden, the seasoned Vice President or Senator. We're handing it over Greta Thunberg in an old man suit. And that's scares me. But another interesting point about when you compare economies, no, the Democrats love to talk about how they are the masters of the safety net. And I want people to just think about what the experience of 2020 was, when we had a Republican-built Trump designed economy that was essentially a safety net that was tested. It was actually tested. And it actually succeeded. Unlike the safety nets created by Democrats, this safety net was tested by a novel catastrophe that we've never experienced before in our lives. Nobody has starved. We have made it through. We have made sacrifices. But we are getting it done largely because of this incredible economy that allowed for a safety net to occur to give out these payments, to make sure people were OK. This is a Republican-built safety net that just blew the doors off any Democrat safety net of the last 50 years. Meanwhile, what are the Dems pushing, an apocalyptic vision that chooses the mob over the individual. When you see somebody -- pushing for achievement, Biden is pushing the politics of envy. And that will get us nowhere in the long run, or even the short term. PERINO: Jesse, this was the second phase of the Biden rollout on his economic plan. Last week was buy American, today, is all about energy. And if you think about the Midwest and how important it is for both candidates to try to win in 2020, what -- how do you think Biden threaded that needle today between going after the progressives who were talking about the apocalyptic climate change issue, as Greg was pointing out. But also this idea for additional jobs and the clean energy market, can you do that? JESSE WATTERS, FOX NEWS HOST: Biden just plagiarized Bernie Sanders' environmental plan, or Bernie Bros. just put a gun to Biden's head and Biden said fine. I will say whatever you want me to say. I mean, this is literally AOC's Green New Deal here, $2 trillion on wind and solar. Do you really think Joe Biden or any of his people can pull it off? First of all, solar only works economically and environmentally in the United States, in the southwest. Wind power only works in the Great Plains in the Midwest. But I guarantee you. All of this trillions of dollars, it's just going to go to lobbyists and donors. And they're going to put some, like, windmill in Maine and a solar panel in Montana. And it's just not going to work. It's just another boondoggle because they are not smart enough to be able to pull it off. The smartest thing to say, if I were Joe Biden, would say I'd be for fracking. But he went so far left in the primary he doesn't like fracking now. Because natural gas is the cleanest energy source we are ever going to have. And god blessed the United States with mountains and mountains of it. And we are just sitting on piles of it. So you can even balance a few solar panels and some windmills with this beautiful, clean, natural gas, and call it a day. But he just won't do it. And Donald Trump can come at him and just say you are an economic illiterate. You don't know what you are talking about. This is basically AOC on steroids. Get out of here and let me rebuild the economy, because Americans trust me more than you by double digits. PERINO: Juan, when the Biden campaign was putting out some PR right before the speech, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez was also tweeting, taking a lot of credit for the speech. Does that keep Biden keep his moderate label? JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS HOST: I think that, you know, a lot of this back and forth over the economic policy at this moment, Dana, I don't think that it really matter as a whole lot if what we are aiming at is the November election. Because I think at the moment, the urgent policy stuff leads us to a referendum on Donald Trump. And right now, Trump is beating Trump. Because if you look at big ticket items, like, you know, do we send our kids back to school in the fall? Axios, iPost has a pullout today, 70 percent of Americans think that's too risky to send our kids back to school. And that includes, like, 79 percent of Democrats and 53 percent of Republicans. No, I'm talking about the election. Because I think that as we aim towards energy, as we aim towards something like how do you get this economy going for the high percentage of people, I think it's like 11, 12 percent now out of work. And you think about the fact that we have arguments coming from this White House over extending unemployment benefits at the end of this month, I think again. Donald Trump is out of sync with the American people. But, you know, it's like when the 5.4 million Americans lose their health insurance, that's a big economic issue. And where is Trump? He is trying to undo Obamacare. So to me, these are urgent policy issues way beyond whether or not we rebuild the infrastructure, which I think is fairly sensible. Whether we rebuild the manufacturing sector, this is what is determining the election. PERINO: Yeah, OK. Katie, we do know that across the board, President Trump does beat Don -- Joe Biden on matters of the economy. I haven't seen him broken down too much in terms of energy. But you were over at the White House today. Tell me your perspective on all this. KATIE PAVLICH, FOX NEWS HOST: I was at the White House today. I had the chance to interview President Trump. He did talk about the election and Joe Biden and said that the economy will crash if Joe Biden wins the election. He talked about how Joe Biden has been in office and around Washington, D.C. for almost five decades. And yet, now all of a sudden is hitching his wagon to this Green New Deal 2.0. And look, you know, you can't argue, as Joe Biden has, that you want to bring back American manufacturing, while also at the same time try to promise some kind of Green New Deal, because the regulations in this country are ready and due to the Environmental Protection Agency and a whole host of other overreach by the government have prevented manufacturing from coming back to this country. And it's going to be very expensive for the average family. Remember in 2016 when Hillary Clinton made the mistake of saying we're going to put coal miners out of business? That's exactly what this will do. Electricity prices will go up. And we tried this before, the Obama administration, which Joe Biden was a part of, lost $5 billion of taxpayer money on Solyndra, which was the solar company that they just gave a bunch of recovery money to that was not successful. So these two things do not go together. You can't promise manufacturing in America while also promising all these regulations, which do not allow of the ingenuity and manufacturing to take place here. PERINO: For viewers that have been watching for many years, you all remember the fond days when we talked about Solyndra over and over. (CROSSTALK) PERINO: All right, Solyndra. We are still awaiting a news conference from President Trump and we will have it for you live. But coming up next, the armed of Missouri couple who confronted protesters outside their home are now saying that they will be indicted. We will have details after the break. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) WATTERS: President Trump set to hold a news conference in the Rose Garden at any moment. Meanwhile, as anarchy rages in cities across America, St. Louis prosecutors appear to have a case of misguided priorities. The armed homeowner who faced off with protesters who broke into his gated community last month says he and his wife will be indicted soon. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: My attorney advised me not to be on the show tonight because of rumors that we are going to be indicted shortly, OK? Having said that, this is the same circuit attorney that released 35 of the protesters that torched and looted downtown St. Louis. But now, she wants to indict me. I didn't shoot anybody. I just held my ground, protected my house. And I'm sitting here on television tonight instead of dead or putting up the smouldering embers of my home. (END VIDEO CLIP) WATTERS: All right. Katie, you spoke with the president earlier about this. It looks like this radical DA Kim Gardner out in St. Louis got a judge to approve her warrant to go in and seize the firearm of this guy. And now, he saying he could be indicted, for what? PAVLICH: For what is the question. The president said that this was a disgrace. This couple was just defending their home and their property. And Jesse, in St. Louis, the law there is they have your stand your ground self-defense law. They were on their own private property. There was a mob that broke through the gate on their private property. They felt threatened. They went out to defend themselves and their lives. They had seen for weeks on end of private property and people almost killed if not killed as a result of these rioters going through the streets. There was, of course, a shop owner in Texas, I believe, who was murdered outside of his shop for daring to defend himself, who he didn't have a gun. So this idea now that this couple, who was obeying the law, following the rules, defending their lives and their property from the mob, are now being politically persecuted by these prosecutors in St. Louis. It is a disgrace. It's an atrocity. It's a miscarriage of justice. And although they know they have no evidence to prove that they committed a crime, they're going to drag them to the legal system anyway and make an example of them that you better not stand up to the mob because this is what's going to happen to you. And it's pretty clear the prosecutors are on the side of the criminals here, not on the side of the innocent victims who are victims of a mob going onto their lawn and threatening their lives. WATTERS: Yes. And we are hearing that the president is going to be speaking momentarily, so we will take you to that when that begins. Greg, this is basic Constitutional stuff. You are allowed to own a firearm. You are allowed to defend your property, your land, and the government cannot go inside your home and take your gun. GUTFELD: Yeah. Well, here's the deal. It's weird that the media has to assure the white liberals that the rising spike in crime is just in poor neighborhoods. So there is no problem with de-funding police or even attacking them. So I'm trying to figure out, when does crime actually matter? If we take inventory, we dismissed the burning buildings as an anomaly, the looted neighborhoods as a cry for economic justice, gang violence as murder. Something that's been here forever, right, and now, we have mob action in the suburb where they tear down the guys' gate and they laugh at that. People don't understand that the more that you dismiss law and order and champion the mob, there's only one thing left for the citizen. And it's the Second freaking Amendment. And we are seeing that now. This is a symbol of things to come. WATTERS: Yeah. And gun sales skyrocketing all over the country, Dana. And this DA seems to be pretty out there, source-funded, she let a bunch of looters and rioters go without charging them. And she's in a -- I guess primary election race coming up in August, so looks like politics to me. PERINO: Well, and I think that one of the things that even the lawyer for the couple suggested that they not go on television because they could in - - getting -- indicted. Their only recourse at this point was to maybe avoid that is publicity, possibly. You know, we'll see what happens to them. But this is not the only place that we are seeing this. Look at what happened in New York City over the weekend or even just yesterday. So Mayor Bill De Blasio, he paints this painting of black lives matter in front of Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue, and he tweeted incessantly about it. Rather than talking about all of the violence we saw, if anybody hasn't had a chance to see Lawrence Jones' interview with the father of the young baby that was killed over the weekend. I really recommend that you try to find that. I think it's up on foxnews.com. We have to reorient our priorities. There's just no other way about it. WATTERS: Yeah. I think we do have some sound from some grieving family members that Lawrence got. Let's play that. And then, Juan, you can react. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I have to put my son on the ground now, and he's only one. His birthday two months -- in two months, he didn't even live to see two. Like, he didn't live life. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Everybody is talking about black lives matter. What about baby lives, what about teenage lives, go to hell. You can go to hell. (END VIDEO CLIP) WATTERS: It's heartbreaking, Juan. WILLIAMS: Yeah. I mean, we've had discussion. And I've very clearly. You have to care about the kind of crime that you see in these poor neighborhoods. But it's not a matter of crime waves throughout the city. Let's go back to St. Louis for a second. Because I think it's important that we have some context and some facts on the table. First of all, it's speculation about the indictment. We don't know what's going to come. I will stay say this, that the statute, the law in Missouri doesn't allow you to brandish a weapon in a threatening, intimidating matter. And as we saw in the video that we showed right here, there was nobody attacking that couple. They were marching towards the mayor's house, which is in that gated development. So I think that when you look at that you say, well, Garner's going to make a decision. It may be a political decision, but that's the decision that's going to be made. Because if you have guns in a potential confrontation, it can be provocative, and we know that brandishing guns in front of people can lead to -- (CROSSTALK) WILLIAMS: So I don't that you should just ignore this thing. She clearly was. Let me finish this point, because the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, in editorial, said, you know, these people, this couple, you have got to know some context. You got to know they're highly litigious, sued their own father and sister that the people at the neighboring synagogue said that these people made the children cry. I mean, this is -- you know, you have to see the whole picture. And if you choose to simply focus -- I want to say these people, they're being victimized in terms of their Second Amendment rights. That's a distortion of this story. WATTERS: OK. Well, Katie, I don't know if Juan knows the law -- (CROSSTALK) GUTFELD: Wait a minute, though. WATTERS: Go ahead. GUTFELD: Are you OK with seeing the whole picture with every victim that we talk about, Juan? When -- if somebody gets killed? (CROSSTALK) WILLIAMS: -- if you have something to say, I'm glad to hear you. (CROSSTALK) GUTFELD: You aren't. Anytime you bring up the background of anybody, unless it's somebody you don't like. WILLIAMS: What are you talking about? I'm talking about the St. Louis, what the St. Louis Post-Dispatch wrote, what the statute of the law says in Missouri. And those are facts and those are contexts for our viewers tonight. WATTERS: All right. Well, let's -- (CROSSTALK) WATTERS: Go ahead. PAVLICH: Yea. I would just hope that anybody who had a mob show up and break into their property would be entitled to their own self defense instead of ending up dead on their doorstep of their home or their business. And the fact is that brandishing has a very different legal term than what Juan is discussing. And it's not brandishing to go outside of your home while there is a mob that has broken to run your private property, is threatening you, that is refusing to leave. That was told to leave multiple times and refused to do so. That is not brandishing a weapon. That is called self defense. And that's exactly what they were doing. And they are alive today as a result and their house remains standing, instead of being burned it down like churches that we've seen, like the buildings in Minneapolis, like the buildings all around the country that have been burned down. And people's lives destroyed as a result of that. WATTERS: Yeah. And not only -- WILLIAMS: Katie, I don't think from the video we saw that there was any motion from the protesters towards that couple. The protesters are -- (CROSSTALK) WATTERS: Hey, Juan. (CROSSTALK) WATTERS: Because if you watched the video -- (CROSSTALK) WATTERS: And they were armed themselves. So to go outside to, you have open-carry -- (CROSSTALK) WATTERS: -- you have castle doctrine and you have stand your ground. And if you knew what you were doing, you'd do the same thing to protect your property and your wife. Next, President Trump's news conference coming up soon, next up, Greg's monologue on the press giving a free pass to New York Governor Andrew Cuomo despite his disastrous handling of the pandemic. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) PAVLICH: You are looking live at the Rose Garden where the president is about to give a news conference. But in the meantime, Hillary Clinton is back stoking fear and paranoia -- the election with this morning about President Trump if he loses in November. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) HILLARY CLINTON, FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I think it is a fair point to raise as to whether or not, if he loses, he's going to go quietly or not. And we have to be ready for that. (END VIDEO CLIP) COMPAGNO: Dana, here we are again with a woman who's never accepted the result of the election, warning about the president not accepting results of the upcoming election. PERINO: They even -- she said that even back in 2016 when it -- actually if you remember on election night it was the Hillary Clinton team that hinted that she would not, but she did the right thing and she conceded in the morning that next day. I have to imagine that the Biden team would really like for her to do these fundraisers for them, but to maybe cutback on the interviews. I don't think it helps people to remember Hillary Clinton as a candidate in 2016 or 2020. He needs to be his own person. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Thank you very much, everybody. Please. (END VIDEO CLIP) PAVLICH: Thank you, Dana. President Trump in the Rose Garden. Let's watch. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) TRUMP: Thank you. So we've had a big day in the stock market. Things are coming back and they're coming back very rapidly. A lot sooner than people thought. People are feeling good about our country. People are feeling good about therapeutics and possible vaccines, but we're going to go over quite a bit and maybe at the end, we'll take some questions if we have time. It's not too hot. Today, I signed legislation and an executive order to hold China accountable for its oppressive actions against the people of Hong Kong. The Hong Kong Autonomy Act, which I signed this afternoon, passed unanimously through Congress. This law gives my administration powerful new tools to hold responsible the individuals and the entities involved in extinguishing Hong Kong's freedom. We've all watched what happened, not a good situation. Their freedom has been taken away. Their rights have been taken away and with it goes Hong Kong, in my opinion, because it will no longer be able to compete with free markets. A lot of people will be leaving Hong Kong, I suspect. And we're going to do a lot more business because of it because we just lost one competitor. It's the way it is. We lost a very, very serious competitor. A competitor that we incentivized to take a lot of business and do well and we gave them a lot of business by doing what we did. We gave them things that nobody else had the right to do, and that gave them a big edge over other markets. And because of that edge, they've done really historic business, tremendous business, far bigger than anybody would have thought years ago when we did this gift. It was really a gift to freedom. Today, I also signed an executive order ending U.S. preferential treatment for Hong Kong. Hong Kong will now be treated the same as Mainland China, no special privileges, no special economic treatment, and no export of sensitive technologies. In addition to that, as you know, we're placing massive tariffs and have placed very large tariffs on China. First time that's ever happened to China. Billions of dollars have been paid to the United States of which I've given quite a bit to the farmers and ranchers of our country because they were targeted. And that's been going on for three years. It's the first time anybody's ever done anything like that. And prior to the plague pouring in from China, they were having the worst year as you know, in 67 years. And I don't want them to have a bad year. I want them to have a good year, but they were taking advantage of the United States for many, many years, and that's stopping. But then the virus came in and the world is a different place, but we're now getting back and one of the reasons the market's doing -- it's almost at the point that it was at prior to the plague. Almost, we're getting very close. It's a great thing. It's an amazing thing what our people have done and what they've endured. No administration has been tougher on China then this administration. We imposed historic tariffs. We stood up to China's intellectual property theft at a level that nobody's ever come close. We confronted untrustworthy Chinese technology and telecom providers. We convinced many countries, many countries, and I did this myself for the most part, not to use Huawei because we think it's an unsafe security risk. It's a big security risk. I talked many countries out of using it. If they want to do business with us, they can't use it. Just today, I believe that U.K. announced that they're not going to be using it. And that was up in the air for a long time but they've decided. And you look at Italy, you look at many other countries. We withdrew from the Chinese dominated, WHO, and we fully rebuilt the United States military. The WHO, World Health Organization, we were paying close to $500 million a year. China was paying $39 million a year. And China had too much say, they worked it very hard, which is a bad thing done by our past administrations. But we were tough and we were saying, I was asking, I said, \"Why are we paying so much more than China?\" China has 1.4 billion people. We have 325, probably 325 million approximately, nobody can give the exact count. We're trying to get an exact count, but you have over the years, many illegals who have come into the country. So it depends on how you want to count it. But you could say 325 to 350 million people, as opposed to 1.4 billion people. And the World Trade is terrible, that deal is terrible. The World Health is terrible deal. We've been very tough on the World Trade Organization and we've been, I guess, as tough as you can get on World Health. We withdrew our money. We told them we're getting out. It doesn't mean that someday we won't go back in. Maybe we will when it's correctly run, but they made a lot of bad predictions and they said a lot of bad things about what to do and how to do it and they turned out to be wrong. And they were really a puppet of China. And make no mistake, we hold China fully responsible for concealing the virus and unleashing it upon the world. They could have stopped it. They should have stopped. It would have been very easy to do at the source when it happened. In contrast, Joe Biden's entire career has been a gift to the Chinese Communist Party and to the calamity of errors that they've made. They made so many errors and it's been devastating for the American worker. China has taken out hundreds of billions of dollars a year from our country. And we rebuilt China. I give them all the credit in the world. I don't give the credit for the people that used to stand here because they allowed this to happen where hundreds of billions of dollars were taken out of the United States Treasury in order to rebuild China. There's no company and no country in the world, no country in the world has ever ripped off the United States like the incredible job that they did on this country and the people that ran it. Possibly, it's one of the reasons, certainly it's one of the very big reasons trade and things related to trade that I got elected in the first place. I've been talking about it for a long time, along with many other subjects, frankly. Joe Biden supported China's entry into the World Trade Organization. One of the greatest geopolitical and economic disasters in world history. If you look at China, you look at the moment they joined the World Trade, they were flatlining for years and years and years and decades. And then all of a sudden, they joined the World Trade Organization, and they went like a rocket ship. They were given all sorts of advantages. They were considered a developing country. As a developing country, they got tremendous advantages over the United States and other countries, and they took advantage of those advantages and then some. Biden personally led the effort to give China permanent, most favored nation status, which is a tremendous advantage for a country to have. Few countries have it. But the United States doesn't have it. It never did, probably never even asked for it because they didn't know what they were doing. As Vice President Biden was a leading advocate of the Paris Climate Accord, which was unbelievably expensive to our country. It would have crushed American manufacturers while allowing China to pollute the atmosphere with impunity, yet one more gift from Biden to the Chinese Communist Party. They took all of the advantage away from us. They took everything away. They don't have oil. We would have had to close up a tremendous amounts of our energy to qualify, eventually, not too far into the future. We would have had to do things that would have been unbelievably destructive to our country, including the possible closing of 25 percent of our businesses, think of that. And it was going to cost us hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars for the privilege of being involved in the Paris Climate Accord. And you just have to look at what took place this year in Paris and France where money was being sent to, countries all over the world and the people of France didn't want to take it, and they didn't, and they did a lot of rioting. They had their taxes raised. We would have had to raise our taxes and it was a disaster. I've been given a lot of credit for what I did there. It took a certain amount of courage, I guess, because it sounds so nice, the Paris Climate Accord. But it wasn't good for us at all. America lost nearly 10,000 factories while Joe Biden was Vice President. Think of that, 10,000 factories. He wrote something today and he made a statement today that I wrote down. It's pretty accurate. So Biden was here for 47 years. Eight years, the last eight years, not long ago as Vice President, he said, \"One in five miles of our highways are still in poor condition.\" Well, we're doing a good job on highways, but why didn't he fix them three years ago? Why didn't he fix them? Tens of thousands of bridges are in disrepair and on the verge of collapse. Well, that's probably not a right number, but we have bridges that should have been fixed. Why didn't he fix him? He was here for eight years with President Obama. Why didn't they fix them? Tens of thousands of bridges. This is what he wrote. High speed broadband. We want high speed broadband. Well, why didn't they get it? Three years ago is not a long time. And he didn't do any of the things, but now he says he's going to be president and as president, he's going to do all the things that he didn't do. He never did -- he never did anything except make very bad decisions, especially on foreign policy. So Joe Biden and President Obama freely allowed China to pillage our factories, plunder our communities and steal our most precious secrets. And I've stopped it, largely, but I've stopped it and it wasn't easy because you talk about a certain power of the telephone and the calls where they would call and say, \"No, we don't want to do that.\" And other countries would call on behalf of China, but I did it. I did what has to be done. And you just take a look at what's gone on and take a look at the kind of -- the numbers where they devalued their currency in order to pay the tariffs. Now, the Democrat party is calling for defunding of our military. Think of that, defunding. They want to defund our military when China is building a massive military. They're building a massive military and Biden wants to defund our military. And the world needs American strength right now, more than ever. And we've got it. We've got now, soon as all this equipment comes in, all made in the USA, we've got the newest, most incredible weapons anywhere in the world. We have the best tanks, the best ships, the best missiles, rockets. We have the best of everything. We have the best fighter jets, the F-35, the F-18. All of these assets are being built, tankers, incredible tankers, bombers. I hope we don't have to use them, but we have the most incredible military. When I came in, the military was totally depleted. It was at a level that was just absolutely incredible. You know the statements. I made the statements before. I told you what generals told me about our military. And I'll make them again. If somebody needs them, we'll give them to you. It's very well documented. As Vice President Biden opposed tariffs, and he was standing up for China. He didn't want to do anything to disrupt the relationship with China even though China was taking us to the cleaners. He opposed my very strict travel ban on Chinese nationals to stop the spread of the China virus. He was totally against it. Xenophobic, he called me, Xenophobic. A month later, he admitted I was right. We would have had thousands of people additionally die if we let people come in from heavily infected China, but we stopped it. We did a travel ban in January. Nancy Pelosi was dancing in the streets of Chinatown in San Francisco a month later and even later than that and others too. They all thought what I did was a terrible mistake. We would have lost -- in fact, Dr. Fauci said we would have lost thousands of additional people if President Trump had to do that. And I was a crowd of one, because even experts didn't want to do it. They thought it was a mistake. And then I did Europe when I started seeing what was going on in Italy and Spain and France and other countries in Europe. I did a ban on people coming in from Europe. That would have been disastrous for our country also. And we saved tens of thousands of lives, but we actually saved millions of lives by closing. By closing up, we saved millions, potentially, millions of lives. It could be, a number that we're actually working on, but it could be two to three million lives. So we're at 135,000, which is terrible. One is too much, but we would have had millions of people dead from this curse that came at us, but we did what we had to do. And now we'll put out the flames as it happens. We have to get the schools open. We have to get everything open. A lot of people don't want to do that for political reasons, not for other reasons. But if we had listened to Joe Biden, hundreds of thousands of additional lives would have been lost. And if you look at the job, he did on swine flu, I looked at a poll, they have polls on everything nowadays, and they got very bad marks on the job they did on the swine flu, H1N1. He calls it N1H1. H1N1 got very poor marks from Gallup on the job they did on swine flu. And they stopped very early on, testing. They totally stopped it. They just said stop. And frankly, if we didn't test, you wouldn't have all the headlines because we're showing cases, and we have just about the lowest mortality rate. But if we did -- think of this, if we didn't do testing, instead of testing over 40 million people, if we did half the testing, we would have half the cases. If we did another -- you cut that in half, we'd have yet again, half of that. But the headlines are always testing. Now the testing is a good thing, but at the same time, it's fodder for the fake news to report cases. So we're doing 40 million plus, it's going to be very close to 45 million people. And when I turned on the news, I see cases, cases, cases. They don't talk about deaths being cut down to a level that actually tenfold they use. I got that from one of the very respected media outlets, tenfold, cut tenfold, yes, but they don't talk about that. They talk about cases and the cases are created because of the fact that we do tremendous testing. We're the best testing in the world. We now make ventilators for the world. We had very few ventilators. There wasn't one person in any hospital anywhere in this country that needed a ventilator that didn't get it. And that was because we mobilized to a level, using the Purchasing Act in some cases, we mobilized to a level that nobody thought possible. Nothing's happened like that since World War II. Our task force has done a great job. Mike Pence works so hard but gets so little credit. It's sad to see that actually, but he works so hard and gets so little credit. The governors would tell us, we'd be on the phone with 50 different governors, they'd all tell us what a great job, great job. And then they'll go to the media and say, \"Well, they didn't do such a good job.\" Well, we did a great job. We made a lot of governors look fantastic. We did in New York -- what we did in New York was one of the most incredible things, 2,800 bed in Javits Center, but the governor used very few of them unfortunately. Then we moved in our great hospital ship, one of our two great -- we move one also to Los Angeles. And we could have used that for our senior citizens. We could have used it for other people. They could have used it instead of sending our seniors back into nursing homes that were infected where you lost thousands of people. Thousands of people in New York died because of poor management by the governor. And it's a very sad thing to see and very sad to watch and very sad to look at those statistics. But we have -- we have an incredible Javits Center that we built with thousands of beds. I think it was 2,800 all ready to go and they could have sent people there, or they could have sent senior citizens there instead of sending them into the nursing homes. And after all of that work and getting it done, the Army Corps of Engineers, I mean, the job they did was incredible. They built it in a matter of days. When it was all completed, FEMA, everybody was there, doctors. We ended up getting doctors. They said, \"We can't man it.\" I said, \"So we'll man it and woman it.\" And that's what we did. We brought in doctors, nurses, everything, we're all set. They didn't send the people. Very few people came in. They could have sent them into the Javits Center. They could have sent him to the hospital ship, which was virtually unused. But we were there. By contrast, my administration acted very early to ban travel from China, from Europe, saving all of these lives, incredible. And I want everyone to know, I want every citizen now that we're using the full power of the Federal government to fight the China virus and to keep our people safe. Through Operation Warp Speed, we will deliver a vaccine in record breaking time. We're doing very well on the vaccines. We have many, many different vaccines being studied right now, many of which are looking really good. And we're ready to distribute the vaccine when we get it. We're all set, taking a risk, an economic risk of preparing for delivery because we feel very certain it's going to be there. But logistically we have our military ready to go. We have generals that -- that's all they do is distribute things and they're going to be distributing hopefully a vaccine or a therapeutic, and it's coming out really well. And I think you're going to have some good news very, very quickly having to do with the vaccines. We're also working with many other countries on the vaccine. Many countries are working with us. We're unleashing our nation's scientific genius to kill the virus. Joe Biden didn't just side with China on the virus, he did. He called me again, xenophobic. That's what he said. You all heard it many times. He described the rise of China as \"a very positive development.\" It's not a positive development. Not for us it's not. He said that the idea that China is our competition is really bizarre. He's really bizarre. He said, \"China is not a problem.\" No, nobody's ripped us off more than China over the last 25, 30 years, nobody close. And he says China is not a problem. Now he takes it all back. Now he wants to be Mr. Tough Guy. But for years, 47 years, he never came out against China, never say anything bad. Just the opposite. His son walked out with $1.5 billion of money to invest where he'll make hundreds of thousands of dollars, maybe millions of dollars a year. He walked out with $1.5 billion. I asked one of the biggest people on Wall Street, maybe the biggest, \"Is that possible?\" He said, no, he's never seen it. They don't do that. But Hunter, where's Hunter, where is Hunter by the way? Hunter Biden walked out with $1.5 billion. In Ukraine, he got $83,000 a month and I guess an upfront payment of $3 million. So he went from not having job to getting $83,000 a month with a lot of money paid up front to work for Burisma. And you all know about Burisma, but nothing happens, nobody cares. And he was unemployed as you know, he was unfortunately forced to leave the military. He was forced to leave. He didn't have a job and, all of a sudden, he's making a fortune, but nobody talks about that. Indeed, Biden expressed more fawning praise about China on an ordinary day than about America. On the 4th of July, the last Independence Day, Biden attacked the United States and said we had, \"never lived up to the ideals of our fathers, our forefathers, or our founding fathers, those founding ideals.\" And yet he enthusiastically stated that China is a great nation and we should hope for its continued expansion. Well, we all wish well to China, but what China has unleashed on the world, it's hard to even fathom. I see people now, friends of mine, they walk up, they want to say hello, and they have to keep their distance and they're all covered up like you're all covered up with face masks. It's a different world, but we're coming out on top. Biden sides with China over America time and time again. And he said on the 4th of July, \"American history is no fairytale.\" And yet blindly celebrates China saying few nations in history have come so far so fast. He's so proud of them. He's so proud of them. Now, Joe Biden is pushing a platform that would demolish the U.S. economy, totally demolish it. So we built the greatest economy in the history of our country, greatest in the history of the world. That was a few months ago. Best unemployment numbers ever, best for African American, Asian American, Hispanic American, best for women, best for everybody, best for young people that didn't have a high school diploma, didn't have a college diploma. If they had a diploma, they were really in good shape. We built the greatest ever stock market, highest ever in history. We had 143 days of all-time stock market highs in just less than three and a half years. And we had to close it down because we did the right thing by doing that. As I said, we saved millions of lives, but China was saying this is incredible what's going on. China was for the first time respecting the United States and now they want to do something that's much different, Joe Biden. So I've watched this and I've watched it with great interest. We're building our economy again. I guess the stock market went up almost 500 points today or something thereabouts, you'll check. But it was up a lot when I left. And our economy is coming back. We're almost at a level where even though it's long before the very important, maybe the most important ever, election of November 3rd. We're long before that, but we're close to record stock markets again. And NASDAQ hit an all-time high for the 16th time. Think of that, for the 16th time over the last month or so, for the 16th time. So one of our markets already hit an all-time high. Today Joe Biden gave a speech in which he said that the core of his economic agenda is a hard-left crusade against American energy. He wants to kill American energy. He wants to reenter the unfair, one-sided Paris Climate Accord, which will destroy us at the expense of many other nations who benefit. It was actually drawn in my opinion, to take advantage of the United States, just like so many other deals that are done to take advantage of the fools running the United States. But this would do nothing for the environment, but would cripple American industry while greatly helping China. He wants to impose massive energy taxes and job crushing mandates to eliminate carbon from the United States economy. Let him define the word carbon because he won't be able to. Obliterating American oil, clean coal, natural gas, and the natural energy resources that supply countless American jobs. Joe Biden put AOC, a young woman, not talented in many ways, in charge of his energy plan and the environment essentially. Her and Bernie Sanders who ran a lot of times for president and never made it. Good base, but that's about it. In other words, he wants to impose the Green New Deal on our country. When I first saw the Green New Deal, I thought it was a joke. I said, \"This will never go anywhere.\" Now they're trying to impose it. This will destroy our country and make us non-competitive with other countries. Don't forget, we're in competition with China and with many other countries throughout the world. We're in tremendous economic competition, including Europe, which has never treated us well. The European Union was formed in order to take advantage of the United States. They formed and they take advantage of the United States. And I know that, they know I know that, but other presidents had no idea. Last week, Joe Biden released his unity platform developed with socialist Bernie Sanders, describing what he would do if elected president. The Biden-Sanders agenda is the most extreme platform of any major party nominee by far in American history. I think it's worse than actually Bernie's platform. It's gone so far, right? And he's doing that because he's begging for that vote. But one of the things I just asked my people to do is just draw up for me just quickly some of the things that we've been hearing about over the last couple of weeks. And these are actual key elements of the Biden Sanders unity platform. Abolish immigration detention, no more detention. You come in here illegally, no more detention. Stop all deportations. So if we get a MS-13 gang member, which we've taken out of our country by the thousands, brought them back to Honduras, Guatemala, you can't do that anymore. El Salvador, you can't do that anymore. Stop all deportations. In other words, we'll take all of these people, many of whom are in prison for rape, murder, lots of other things. End prosecution of illegal border crossers. Oh, OK, they come in illegally and we have to stop the whole process. Support the deadly sanctuary cities where many of these people are protected better than the American citizen is protected. Incentivize illegal alien child smuggling. Give it an incentive because if you look at what they're saying, that's exactly what they do.

Others considering it. We're similarly following developments in North Carolina, where we're told that schools will reopen in the fall, but with some caveats, also following developments in a host of other states that are playing kind of loosey- goosey with this, a mix of in-person classes, virtual classes. Bottom line, the president has said that he wants to see all schools reopen in the fall. It is now a given, at the very least, that some of the more populated school districts across the country will not heed his wishes. Welcome, everybody. I'm Neil Cavuto. And this is YOUR WORLD. Let's go to Jonathan Serrie with the latest on this, as well as the latest case count that has really spurred all this -- Jonathan. JONATHAN SERRIE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: It has, indeed, Neil. North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper's announcement came just within the past hour. He says that all students, regardless of whether they're kindergarten or as old as 12th grade, they're going to have to wear masks and social distance if they return to physical school buildings in the hall -- in the fall. As far as his plans for reopening, he really envisions a hybrid plan. Here's what he said: (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. ROY COOPER (D-NC): Today, we announced that North Carolina schools will be open for both in-person and remote learning, with key safety precautions to protect the health of our students, teachers, staff, and families. (END VIDEO CLIP) SERRIE: Later in the show, we will be hearing from the superintendent of the nation's second largest school district. The Los Angeles Unified School District has decided to stick with online instruction, as that city's positive test rate for coronavirus approaches 10 percent. That's twice the World Health Organization's maximum safe threshold for communities to reopen. But in neighboring Orange County, the school board voted to recommend schools reopen in the fall without mandates for face coverings or social distancing. And, in Detroit, protesters blocked school buses, as that city begins summer classes this week. New York City plans to offer a hybrid of both in- person and online learning in the fall. Four former CDC directors are criticizing the Trump administration for undermining federal health officials' recommendations on reopening schools and the economy. In a Washington Post op-ed today, they write: \"These repeated efforts to subvert sound public health guidelines introduce chaos and uncertainty, while unnecessarily putting lives at risk.\" Neil, you may recall, last week, President Trump tweeted that the CDC's guidance for school openings was -- quote -- \"very tough and expensive\" -- back to you. CAVUTO: Thank you, my friend, very much, Jonathan Serrie. We're going to be getting the read from the White House momentarily how the president is responding to this. In the meantime, I want to go to Austin Beutner, the L.A. Unified District superintendent. Superintendent, thank you for taking the time. What are you going to do? How does the fall look to you right now? AUSTIN BEUTNER, SUPERINTENDENT, LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT: \u00a0Thanks for having me. We're going to start online, because that's where health and safety take us. As your colleague mentioned, the rate of infection in our community is twice the World Health Organization guidelines for opening a community. So we have got to start there. And we know it's a struggle. We know we're balancing three sometimes conflicting objectives, the learning needs of students, the impact the virus is having on working families and the communities we serve, and the health and safety of all in the school community. We have to put health and safety first. CAVUTO: So, when the president says that districts that are not doing this, or states or locales that are not opening up are doing it politically and it's all politically motivated, what do you want to tell him? BEUTNER: We have got to get out of the politics and get into the realm of solving the solution, solving the problem, which is, we all want to be back in schools as soon as possible. We know where that's the best learning occurs. Whether that's the White House or here in Los Angeles, I think we could all agree on that. Let's focus on where the federal government can help get us back to school quicker. And if we look at examples around the world, they have done three things well. They have changed health practice in schools. They will spread the desks apart, wear the masks, put down the painter's tape, so people don't bump into each other in the hall, clean surfaces. That's been talked about a lot. The other two pieces, the other two legs of the stool are testing and contact tracing. And we think, until that's done in schools, it's going to keep us from getting back. But, if we do it, we can get back safer and quicker. CAVUTO: Superintendent, if the governor had not reimposed some restrictions on businesses and bars, indoor dining, on that sort of thing, would you have moved to delay the in-person school year? BEUTNER: Yes, we arrived at our decision, actually, before he made that announcement. We have been tracking the health factors for the last month or so. Back in May, it looked better. There was less incidence in the community. We were below the World Health Organization threshold. Since June, it's really skyrocketed, now being twice that threshold. So we have known for a period of weeks we're headed towards this point. Now that we see clear data, we made the decision. But we actually made that before the governor imposed the further restrictions on businesses. CAVUTO: Superintendent, we're learning today that New Hampshire, New Jersey and North Carolina all plan to open for in-person classes. I believe the North Carolina governor did leave open the possibility that districts, municipalities that feel otherwise, are uncomfortable with that, or dealing -- I'm paraphrasing here, sir -- a spike in cases and the like, that they can go the virtual route. But they are trying the in-person route first. You are not. Is it -- is it just a sense that the kids, it's a danger for them, it's a danger their exposure to teachers and administrators, the risk of them bringing it back home? What cinched it for you? BEUTNER: Well, just a couple things to mention. First is, this is a local disease that happens locally. So, the conditions in New Hampshire and North Carolina may be different than here in Los Angeles. If we were having this conversation in May or early June, I'd say, all systems go, we're going to be back in school facilities. It's now July, mid-July, and that has changed. The facts and circumstances have changed here in Los Angeles. The other thing that we're learning is more and more science and data becomes available to us. There was a study done on a village, a town in Italy; 15,000 people were all tested because they quarantined the whole village. Of those who tested positive, half of them showed no symptoms. That's a wakeup call for all of us that we have got to get that testing in place, because, even if we were to reopen facilities in a congregant setting and bring back multiple generations, a 10-year-old student with a 30-year-old teacher and a 50-year-old bus driver, going home to a 7-year-old grandmother, before we do that, we got to make sure that we're keeping all who may have the virus out of the school community. That includes those who show no symptoms, and testing is the only way to do that. CAVUTO: Mr. Beutner, thank you very much for taking the time, Austin Beutner, the L.A. Unified School superintendent. I want to go to the White House now in reaction to all of this. The president, as you know, has not been a fan of any school system that toys with the possibility of delaying the start of the in-person school year. Now you have three very big ones in Atlanta and, of course, Los Angeles right now that are saying -- San Diego as well -- we're not so sure about that. We're going to push things back. Kristin Fisher at the White House now with all the goings on there -- Kristin. KRISTIN FISHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Yes, well, despite those developments in California, the state's two largest school districts saying they are going to go online only in August, the White House is really continuing to push that all schools reopen for in-person classes this fall. And, right now, the vice president, Mike Pence, is in Louisiana making that case. He did wear a mask today, as his did almost everybody else that he was with, except for when he was speaking, which is important, because cases of coronavirus are on the rise there. And the point that the vice president was making is that, remember, New Orleans saw that really early surge in cases. It was one of the original hot spots. They were able to flatten or at least bend the curve. And the vice president said today that he believes that they will be able to bend it back down for a second time. As for schools, the vice president said that the governor of Louisiana informed us today that the plan in that state is to reopen schools on time. The vice president was joined by several members of the Coronavirus Task Force, the education secretary, Betsy DeVos. Dr. Birx was also there. But one key member of the Coronavirus Task Force was not there, Dr. Anthony Fauci. He is going to be speaking to students at Georgetown University in just a few minutes. And, yesterday, he was making the case that he believes an entire shutdown is not necessary, but he believes that, in order to reopen safely, there does need to be a little bit of a pullback. Listen here. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, NIAID DIRECTOR: I am really confident we can, if we step back. You don't necessarily need to shut down again, but pull back a bit, and then proceed in a very prudent way of observing the guidelines of going from step to step. (END VIDEO CLIP) FISHER: Meanwhile, you have the former Vice President and the president's 2020 opponent Joe Biden giving a big speech today on the economy. But he also really pushed back on the president's plan for not just reopening the country, but reopening schools this fall. Watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOSEPH BIDEN (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Mr. President, open everything now isn't a strategy for success. It's barely a slogan. Quit pushing the false choice between protecting our health and protecting our economy. All it does is endanger our recovery on both fronts. (END VIDEO CLIP) FISHER: So, Neil, it's going to be very interesting to see if President Trump decides to respond to some of those attacks from the former Vice President Joe Biden when President Trump speaks in the Rose Garden. That is set for 5:00 p.m., Neil. CAVUTO: All right, Kristin, thank you very much, Kristin Fisher at the White House. We will be monitoring those developments as well. Just a quick peek give, before we take a break, corner of Wall and Broad. It wasn't this confusion over school reopenings that had folks buying today. It was the promise of vaccines and treatments, no fewer than at least 15 of them either paired with other companies or governments, one showing such promise that it could be available by the fall. We're on that, also on top of the other big story gripping the nation, the continued violence in America's cities, two big ones on the West Coast that have a lot of folks wondering, will it ever end? After this. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) CAVUTO: If you're a foreign student and here in the United States, and you're studying at colleges online, and you're worried about the president's directive issued a little more than a week ago that he might be inclined to kick you out, you can relax. He relented a little bit. The president outlining his plan right now that he will not be doing that for international college students to leave the U.S. if they're still in the middle of their classes, whether they're online or not. He might detail that a little bit more when he addresses reporters in about 45 minutes. Separately, we were telling you right now about the spike in cases, particularly in Florida, which, in a lot of people's eyes, has made Miami suddenly the new Wuhan. That might be a bit of a stretch. But at Miami Beach, they're not taking any chances and, officially, as of today, prohibiting short-term rentals. Now, separately, we will have the mayor of the town of Miami, different from Miami Beach, what he makes of this and these other developments, where they're limiting beach access and social distancing amid these new waves of cases that are going on there. So, it -- these are pretty powerful developments. Then there's the issue of violence in this country, more an issue out West with what's been happening in Seattle and now in Portland. Jonathan Hunt on some very big ones that have police concerned this is getting out of control -- Jonathan. JONATHAN HUNT, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Neil, clashes between police and protesters in Portland last night came during what is the seventh consecutive week of demonstrations in the city. Police said rocks, bottles and ball bearings were thrown at them. They threatened to use tear gas to disperse the crowd, but did not ultimately need to do so. In a separate incident northeast of Seattle, two police officers were involved in a traffic stop. When backup officers arrived, they found that two colleagues had both been shot. One of those to die. The other was treated at a hospital and has now been released. Neither has been identified at this point. The suspect was arrested several hours later. Now, according to the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund, 70 officers have died in the line of duty in 2020, up to July 13. That's down 14 percent from the same period in 2019. Thirty of those killed this year died in firearms incidents, one more than the 29 killed over the same period in 2019. Twenty-seven died in traffic-related accidents, 13 due to other causes. Now, it's worth noting, Neil, that the Officers Memorial Fund keeps a separate tally of those officers who've died as a result of exposure to COVID-19 in the line of duty. That number currently stands at 63, making coronavirus, according to the Memorial Fund, by far the leading cause of law enforcement deaths in 2020 -- Neil. CAVUTO: Thank you, my friend, very, very much. In the meantime, I want to go right now to Mike Solan. He's the Seattle Police Officers Guild president, joining us now via Skype. Mike, it doesn't seem to ease up in your town. And I'm wondering now, efforts to cut the police budget, and maybe substantially, in Seattle, if that's really helping matters any. MIKE SOLAN, PRESIDENT, SEATTLE POLICE OFFICERS GUILD: Hey, Neil. Thanks for having me on again. No, it's absolutely making things worse. And the socialist-leaning city council has our entire reasonable community, which I now referred to as the ignored majority of the citizens of Seattle, hostage by their unreasonable activism. Now they're talking about removing funding 50 percent of us, which would remove two-thirds of the police jobs, which would make the CHOP or CHAZ, if you want to refer to that situation, basically child's play to what kind of crime would besiege our entire city. And you could just imagine what we're all feeling at this point, due to our job security at this point. So it's a very troubling time. And I hope people across this nation realize that Seattle is leading the way as far as how public safety will be conducted coming to you. It's very troubling. CAVUTO: And it is playing out across the country, whether people are fond of the police or not. It's no coincidence there's been an uptick in more violence right now, as there's an all-out assault on police budgets. I'm just wondering, in New York, where they have pared a billion from the police budget, now they're looking to pare more -- obviously, you're familiar with what's going on in Seattle. This is playing out in no fewer than 23 U.S. cities. What's going on? SOLAN: And this has been -- yes, it's a national trend, and it's basically socialism on steroids. It's not at our doorstep anymore. They have breached the door and they're coming through. And please understand that this must be stopped. America needs to wake up as to what is occurring. And if we lose 50 percent of our department, we're talking 1,100 officers gone. Who's left to answer the 911 call to investigate that child rape? You can just imagine. So, please, I understand that if people -- people need to get involved. This ignored majority across our city, and, more importantly, across our nation need to rise up. And if you want to get involved, please assist at = . Please stand up to this unreasonable socialist activism. CAVUTO: I don't know what's going on in Seattle. Mike. I'm familiar with what's happening in New York City, where better than 400 officers have already requested retirement. Some of them are eligible for it, but had held off on it. Now they're flooding the system with such requests. But we're similarly seeing new rookie classes being pared down, frustration over whether it's a good thing to even be a police officer these days. What do you make of all this? SOLAN: Well, I make of it it's dividing us more than uniting us. I mean, we're definitely having people that are retiring early here, looking for jobs elsewhere. But, more importantly, Neil, is that the defund movement is based upon how they view as law enforcement, which they do not respect anymore. And, more importantly, there's a certain city council member that heads the public safety chair on our council that is looking at the possibility of, when officers are terminated or furloughed, based upon this 50 percent cut, they want to dictate those cuts based upon the person's race, which is astronomically, horrifically bad, which violates all laws and just common sense. But that's where we are. That's the level of insanity that we're plagued with by this unreasonable, activist city council that has our ignored majority hostage. And it's very troubling. And you can just imagine the mental health that's impacting our officers is at an all-time high. And you know that suicides by police officers are all -- at the highest level they have ever been. And you can just imagine, with all the protests we have had to deal with, the assaults, the amount of vitriol that was plagued against our membership, now we're dealt with this defund movement, which is national now, which is all socialist-backed propaganda and well-funded, is now we have to deal with this as far as losing our jobs. So, the hits just keep on coming. But I need America rise up here. The ignored majority needs to wake up as to what's occurring. CAVUTO: Mike, thank you very, very much. I always hate talking under these circumstances, but I learn a lot, Mike Solan, the Seattle Police Officers Guild president. Just to keep you up, there are a lot of unintended consequences to the type of violence Mike was outlining, including innocent people caught in the crossfire, and the latest example in New York, a 1-year-old little boy -- after this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0 UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I can't hear him calling me daddy no more. I can't kiss him no more. I can't play with him no more. I can't do nothing with him no more. Like, I have got to put my -- I got to put my son in the ground now. (END VIDEO CLIP) (COMMERCIAL BREAK) CAVUTO: All right, you might want to add Dr. Anthony Fauci to the list of those concerned about putting off kids being in person for school, saying in Georgetown that to keep children in school, because of the impact of keeping children out, that's what's important -- after this. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DAVELL GARDNER SR., FATHER OF SHOOTING VICTIM: I got to put my son in the ground now. And he's only 1, his birthday, two months -- in two months. He didn't live to see 2. Like, he didn't live life. And it's like I wanted to get him out this violence before something like this happened. SAMANTHA GARDNER, GRANDMOTHER OF SHOOTING VICTIM: For the cowards that did this, you should be ashamed of yourself because everybody talk about black lives matter. What about baby lives? (END VIDEO CLIP) CAVUTO: Lawrence Jones has been talking about this for weeks now. When it comes to black lives matter, which matter? Shouldn't they all matter? He joins us right now. Lawrence, this case is particularly shocking, because it's a 1-year-old boy caught up in the crossfire, both literally and figuratively, and now dead. For what, right? For what? LAWRENCE JONES, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Neil, I reported last week about Chicago, what is happening in there. And right now, we're seeing it hit right home here in New York City. Crime, when it comes to shooting, are up 130 percent. I just got some new numbers from the sources, and they say now it's up to 161 percent. This kid was in a stroller when he was gunned down in the middle of a fight. And they still haven't been able to catch the suspects, because no one in the community is talking. Neil, as I continue to say on the network -- and I have been very vocal when it comes to the state abusing its power -- when police get it wrong, I'm on the network reporting on it, getting all the facts. But when an innocent young black life is taken from us, I have to report on that too. And the fact that you're not seeing outrage across the country is concerning to me. Just because this happened in the projects, just because these people were in a poor neighborhood does not mean they're not entitled to life and the same liberties that our audience and people that are in rich neighborhoods are entitled to. CAVUTO: Now that dad to bury a little boy. And I'm wondering. Given everything that's going on, does he blame anyone? Is he just overwhelmed? Does he just think, how did this get so bad so quickly? What? JONES: Well, the dad and the grandmother blame the political leadership. And it's not about a partisan issue. It's the fact that the elected leaders aren't doing anything to prevent this from happening. The AOCs of the world say that this crime is happening because of the coronavirus. Well, that's just simply not true. The crime has been happening in these neighborhoods for a while. And people aren't doing anything about it. The elected leaders don't care about the death, poverty and destruction that have been happening in these communities for a long time. Neil, I don't just talk about these cities, Philly, Detroit, Chicago, New York City. I go to these cities and I talk with the people. And they're begging -- they don't care what ideology you believe in -- for someone to stop the bleeding. And you know what? Neither political party has been able to do it. You got the Democrats that run these neighborhoods. They have failed on it. And then you have the Republicans that don't show up to help solve the problem. So, again, they don't want a political solution. They want a human solution. And I think everybody should care about all of these black lives. CAVUTO: And, as you pointed out, Lawrence, the other day, I mean, this is not an isolated incident. Violent crimes, homicides are up better than 118 percent just over the last six weeks in the New York metropolitan area, up about 70-plus percent in Chicago. It's playing out again and again. And it seems to be spreading. I just talked to a Seattle police chief, who is very concerned about budget cuts there, and how it's going to lead, and has already led to more violence there. This does seem to be permeating the nation. JONES: Well, I will tell you this, Neil. You know me. I'm a libertarian. I'm not ashamed of my ideology. And I believe in cutting. But it doesn't make any sense to cut from the police department when crime is a problem. There's a bunch of other line items that they can cut from right now. If they could point to results by cutting from the police department, then I would be for it. But, right now, it hasn't bared much fruit. You got a billion dollars that has been cut from the New York Police Department. And right now, crime is skyrocketing, especially when it comes to violent crime. So, again, I asked the mayor, is there anything -- maybe look at your wife's proposals that she's gotten. And they're getting millions and millions of dollar. Cut from those areas. But don't come from a police department that is already underwhelmed -- overwhelmed by crime. There are so many unsolved cases currently. Yesterday, just by the numbers, 18 people were shot, one person was killed in New York. Those crimes have not been solved. So, again, does it make sense to continue to cut from a police department that is already begging for more help? CAVUTO: Lawrence Jones, thank you, my friend. I appreciate it, and the insight. JONES: Thanks, brother. CAVUTO: We will keep track of this, because it is spreading everywhere, and the numbers are numbing. All right, when we also come back, Senator Rand Paul will be joining us, talking about what's going on right now, the latest push for stimulus in Washington. He's not a fan of some of the numbers he's been hearing -- after this. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) CAVUTO: All right, there is more stimulus coming. We can tell you that. We don't know how much, but we do know that more is on the way. And maybe by the end of the summer, it will all be put together. Here's the thing, though. We don't have any money to pay for it. In the most recent month of June, we were spending $864 billion more than we were taking in. In other words, the deficit for just one month was $864 billion. It's a familiar theme in what is now increasingly looking like at least a $3 trillion annual deficit. And that might be conservative. Blake Burman on what this could mean going forward. Hey, Blake. BLAKE BURMAN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Hi there, Neil. On that one month of June, just to put that in perspective, more than some fiscal years in total, fiscal years in recent memory. In any event, that eye-popping numbers is not going to slow down the White House as it relates to putting out a phase four relief proposal here, if not in the upcoming days, certainly in the upcoming weeks. The White House spokesperson, Judd Deere, sending me this statement this afternoon, saying -- quote -- \"The White House is sensitive to the rising deficit, which certainly furthers the president's priority that any phase four package be targeted, and one that advances pro-growth policies and incentivizes reemployment.\" The top Republican on the House Ways and Means Committee is Kevin Brady, spoke with you earlier today on \"Cavuto Coast to Coast.\" He continued to tout this idea of a reemployment bonus, which is popular among many Republicans here in Washington. Watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. KEVIN BRADY (R-TX): We know then when unemployment benefits end, the people tend to look for work pretty aggressively. And, right now, we know mainstream businesses are having trouble getting their workers to come back. I do you think a return-to-work bonus or some economic incentive to reconnect those workers is important for both them and that business in a key way. (END VIDEO CLIP) BURMAN: So that's what Republicans are talking about. But Democrats here in Washington are pushing for an extension of that $600 unemployment insurance benefit, that federal plus-up that expires at the end of the month, certainly possible that both sides could meet in the middle. The House speaker, Neil, by the way, Nancy Pelosi, said today that if there is not a deal before Congress takes its summer break in August, that traditional August recess, then she would be in favor of keeping the House here in Washington, before letting them skip town for the entirety of the month. Bottom line here. Neil, both sides hoping to get a deal in the upcoming weeks -- Neil. CAVUTO: All right. Thank you, my friend, Blake Burman, outside the White House reporting on all of that. Let's go to Senator Rand Paul on this. Of course, he's quite a fiscal hawk when it comes to such matters. And that generally gets the ire of even some in his party. So, it's a good time to ask him about this latest stimulus push. What do you think, Senator? Are you for more stimulus? SEN. RAND PAUL (R-KY): Well, we have no money, Neil. There's no rainy day fund. There's no savings account. It's not like we go over to the Federal Reserve, open the safe, and we find out, oh, we have all this money we can give to people. The $3 trillion we have already sent to people because of this government mandated depression has been borrowed. Where are they going to get another trillion dollars? They're going to borrow it. And so I think it's a really, really rotten thing to do. What you have to do is look at the source. The source of the economic depression is the government and the government shutdown of the economy. The government, and particularly the governors, need to get out of the way, let the economy open up, and let individuals assess their risk and act accordingly. CAVUTO: So, when there's talk about extending unemployment benefits, which are very generous on the federal level, or what some of your Republican colleagues have come up with, an incentive to get people to go back to work, you're against both? PAUL: Well, if you pay people not to work, they won't work. If you pay people more not to work than they get for working normally, they won't work. It's called institutional unemployment. So, right now, the institutional unemployment, if you make less than about $50,000 a year, you have got no business working. Why work if the government will give you a free $50,000? If the Democrats get their way, and unemployment goes on for months and months and months, if not years, what will happen is, nobody will work for less than $50,000 in this country, because you can get that for not working. The Republicans' idea, only slightly less stupid. The Republicans are going to give you a bonus to go back to work. Well, where are they getting the money? They're going to borrow it from you. They're going to borrow it from your kids. They're going to borrow it from China. It's a ridiculous notion that we just keep passing out money. Let's get rid of the root cause of this depression. Sometimes, we don't know exactly the cause of the depression. In this one, we do know the cause, the government. The government shut the economy down. The government needs to get the hell out of the way and let us all go back to work, and let each and every one of us assess the risk and make decisions accordingly. CAVUTO: Senator, you're also a doctor. And many school districts and municipalities, including some big ones, Los Angeles and San Diego and Atlanta, are among those saying, we're going to delay the school year because we don't like the spike in cases we're seeing. We think it's risky. So, we're going to put it off. How do you feel about that? PAUL: Well, the teachers union in California also said they won't go back to work until we defund the police and have Medicare for all. So, we have to put this into a bit of perspective. But what I would say is, the media have been scaring people to death. The mortality for children 0 to 18 is one in a million or less. The mortality between 18 years of age and 45 is about 10 in 100,000. So, we need to assess those risks and make decisions. The countries that have opened schools -- 22 countries have opened schools in Europe, and they're doing just fine. They haven't had a surge. The other interesting thing is, when you do contact -- contact tracing, in China, the Netherlands, Britain and in Iceland, what you find is, kids not only rarely get this, rarely die from it, but they rarely transmit it. They're just not good transmitters. And, in general, people who are asymptomatic are not good transmitters. So, the day cares stayed open in New York throughout this for doctors' kids, nurses' kids, hospital janitors' kids, anybody that was associated, firemen, police. The day care stayed open. CAVUTO: Right. PAUL: And guess what? Had very little coronavirus and very few staff members -- about 1 percent of staff members were infected. And most of these staff members, if they're in a reasonable age group, are at very, very low risk of succumbing to this disease. CAVUTO: Well, actually, that puts you kind of on the same page as Dr. Fauci. I know two had your disagreements. He is for opening schools in person. But he did say this about , I guess, an answer to a question about whether he's being slighted by the White House. He said: \"You can trust respected medical authorities. I believe I'm one of them. So, you can trust me. But you need to stick to the data, the science, medical authorities who have a track record of telling the truth. The public can get mixed messages and get confused.\" What do you think of that? PAUL: Well, look, I think Dr. Fauci is well-intentioned. I don't think he's a bad person. I think he wants what's best for the country. But his perspective is that of someone who's always worked for the government and never worked outside of government. So, there's a Dr. Scott Atlas, who is a professor at Stanford, as part of the Hoover Institute, who has a much different and I think much more reasoned perspective. So, what we do is, we listen to a lot of these people. But, ultimately, if we're going to live in a free country, none of these people should get to make a decision for us, for us individually. Each individual should assess the risks and make their choices. Frankly, if you're 18 years old, the rules should be or the advice should be much different than if you're 80 years old, and if you're in a nursing home and you're 85 years old. And so it isn't one-size-fits-all. We can't say, oh, everybody needs to stay at home because someone at the nursing home might get sick. No, let's try to be careful and protect those in the nursing home, but let's open the economy, open the schools. There's a possibility -- and we don't know this yet -- but there's a possibility that this great spike in infections that we're seeing throughout the South, that it may well be enhancing immunity. And it may well be that they reach what I think New York has already reached, a point at which the disease will begin to burn itself out. Interestingly, no one's saying this, but it may not be herd immunity of 60 percent. It may be a break point for the disease that's much less than that. And there are mathematicians who look at this, and they say that the models of herd immunity are based on random behavior and random vaccination. When you get herd immunity from the disease, it's not randomly distributed. And you have some who are very social and some who are less social. But the bottom line is, historically, diseases and viruses have burnout at 25 percent immunity, when you look back at our past. No one knows what the future holds, but I tend to be optimistic that we might get to 20, 25 percent immunity, and the disease may be -- we may be well over -- may be able to overcome the disease at that point. CAVUTO: Very quickly, we will be talking to the mayor of Miami. Now, it's Miami Beach that has already put out a proviso no short-term rentals here, fearing that the thing is -- it's worsening. It's different from Miami, I grant you, but do you think that is an overreaction? PAUL: I think we don't know until we see the death rate. I think that infection rate and testing are complicated, whether things are going up or down. CAVUTO: Right. PAUL: I do believe they are going up and people are infected. Even in my town here, Bowling Green in Kentucky, we meet people every day who are infected. And, to a person, they're all getting better. They're getting mild disease and getting better. So, if they're -- if this is a mild disease in Miami, don't shut it down. If you have an increase in your death rate, and it's significant, maybe you should. CAVUTO: All right. PAUL: But, so far, Florida's doing way better than New York. You wouldn't know that if you watch CNN, but Florida is doing way better than New York. New York had a disaster, a public policy disaster, public health disaster in their nursing homes, due to Democrat Governor Cuomo's decisions. Florida is doing a lot better. But you won't get that from the media that has become so biased and cannot report any of this objectively. CAVUTO: All right. PAUL: It's a disaster. CAVUTO: Senator Rand Paul, thank you very much. I believe the senator was referring to total cases, total hospitalizations, total deaths. Now, when we come back again, the move in Miami Beach right now, not only shut down those beaches, but also prevent people from coming down there for short-term vacation rentals. The mayor of Miami, separate from the beach, on what he makes of that -- after this. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) CAVUTO: All right, first the beaches, and now Miami Beach is telling short-term renters, better luck next time. We really don't want any short- term rentals. So, if you're looking at it, cancel it now. Francis Suarez is the mayor of Miami, again, separate from Miami Beach here. He joins us right now. Mayor, always good to have you. What do you think of this move? Is it justified? FRANCIS SUAREZ (R), MAYOR OF MIAMI, FLORIDA: I think the reason why they're doing it is because South Beach attracts a lot of tourists. And it's very, very difficult to control the crowds. There's large crowds of people... CAVUTO: Right. SUAREZ: ... that are gathered together. So, the whole idea of social distancing kind of goes out the window in South Beach. And I think that's what they're trying to get ahold of. CAVUTO: Do you support a move like that? It's a little different in your neck of the woods. Are you, as well, looking at those who might be coming to your city for a vacation, short- term rentals and the like, that you would consider the same? SUAREZ: Yes, I think, for us, we're always looking at -- and one of the things we have in our city is sort of underground parties, where, basically, bars have been closed by order of the governor. And we see people that basically try to create, recreate a bar in a warehouse. And so we shut down two of those this weekend. We shut down about 10 businesses over the weekend. So, we have been trying to dramatically enforce or increase our enforcement to make sure that, you know, things don't get worse in the city, which is obviously seeing -- and in Dade County, which is obviously seeing record number of cases over the last few days. CAVUTO: You know, Mayor, the greater Miami area has been compared to sort of like the new Wuhan, the new hotbed area of the virus. Do you think that's fair? SUAREZ: You know, that was one of the epidemiologists down here that said that. I think that was -- I don't know if she said that as an epidemiological opinion, expert opinion. But I think -- I think there was 50,000 cases a day in Wuhan. We're nowhere near that, obviously. We're at 3,500. CAVUTO: Right. SUAREZ: I think, in New York, you had a death rate that was at 8 percent. Our death rate is somewhere in the 2 percent range, and our death rate has been stable. We do have an issue with our hospitals very, very close to or very nearing capacity. And we are trying to create more capacity. And we do -- we may have to take some dramatic measures, if things don't improve over the next few weeks. And that's something that we're hoping that we can all together -- we had the governor today. We just came from a meeting with the governor and with all the mayors -- or all the major mayors of major cities -- of many of the major cities in Dade County, so that we can at least communicate whatever we're going to do with one message, because I think it is very important for us to communicate clearly and coherently one message, so that people will follow it. CAVUTO: Are you for kids going back to school in Miami this fall in person? SUAREZ: You know, we had a big discussion about that just a few minutes ago. Right now, obviously, we have a tremendously high amount of cases. I can tell you, personally, my daughter is still not school-ready. So she's not going to be going to school. And, actually, she could have been going into preschool. And my wife is thinking of holding her back. My son, who's 6, will probably do virtual learning, if things don't get better. But there are many families in our community that are in lower income, and they may not have another choice to be able to not send their kids to school, if they want to work. So, right now, what I have understood so far is that parents will be given an option as to whether their kids can go to school or not. That may change, given the circumstances. Obviously, schools are six weeks away from opening. And that's -- hopefully, we will see a significant improvement before that day comes. CAVUTO: Because the governor, I believe, DeSantis, is still on board with schools reopening for in-person classes, as things stand now. Do you support that? SUAREZ: Yes, he definitely -- he definitely does feel that way. He reiterated that. For me, it's more about the circumstances. I -- today, as of right now, with the cases the way they are, and the fact that we're still in phase one, under the CDC guidelines promulgated by the federal government, schools would not be open. CAVUTO: Right. SUAREZ: So, I think we have to see how things are going to evolve over the next six weeks. I can tell you that, if things don't get better over the next week to four weeks, we're going to have a hospital problem, and we're going to have to potentially consider taking some very extreme measures. So, we're trying to communicate to our residents that this is the time for them to take this seriously, to wear their mask in public, and to distance socially, and wash your hands. And we also are seeing that a large percentage of the transmission is at home, people going back home, from a family member. So, we're also messaging that out, so that people are more careful when they get home, and don't just pretend like they didn't potentially get exposed from the outside. CAVUTO: All right, Mayor, best of luck, and to your two little ones there, as you balance that. You're a parent, too, after all, so you have a lot to juggle. Mayor Suarez, thank you very, very much. SUAREZ: Thank you, Neil. CAVUTO: Just focusing on the White House right now. We're minutes away from a presidential press conference. China will be the big issue right now. We have been getting very in your face with the Chinese right now on a whole host of issues, from Hong Kong, to setting up military installations in islands all across the South China Sea. Our Charlie Gasparino has been following all of this, because trade, I guess, Charlie, hangs in the balance, right? CHARLIE GASPARINO, FOX NEWS SENIOR CORRESPONDENT: Yes, I mean, we're a long way from the phase one victory lap that the Trump administration had before the coronavirus. It's -- we are now at a point where there is all-out trade war with China, and it's war on a number of levels. It's an economic war. It's preventing Chinese companies maybe from operating here, like the music app TikTok, as the Trump administration believes that that music app is taking information from its users, mainly kids, but also social influencers, and giving it to the surveillance part of the Chinese government. The Trump administration really blames the Chinese for the coronavirus outbreak. They're on pretty good ground on that one. So, this is not a good time for Chinese-American relations. I will say this. I find it fascinating that the Democrats are chiming in as well. Joe Biden, if you saw some of his economic plans, it's all about stopping trade with China or limiting trade with China. There is a populist consensus in this country that China has done us wrong with the virus, with other -- with other measures. And I think you're going to see that play out through the election. Both sides see it as fertile ground for voters. And to be honest with you, the Trump administration was the first real -- first time anybody -- any administration called out China so blatantly. No one else did in the past. They deserve credit for that. I'm not saying we should have gone the full tariff route. But we -- but the Trump administration went out there and clearly labeled China as a bad player, as a menace to the world economy. Listen, if there's -- there's no better proof than the coronavirus outbreak, which emanated there. So I think you're going to hear Donald Trump ramp up the rhetoric in this. I mean, clearly, from his economic aides, you could -- I have been speaking with them off the record, but Larry Kudlow has been saying it on the record. This is not a good time for the Chinese -- for Chinese-American relations. I can't imagine they're going to is going to be phase two of a trade deal with them, given just how much animosity is out there. So... (CROSSTALK) CAVUTO: And, by the way, Charlie, you're right on that. Catherine Herridge from CBS was interviewing the president on that subject, and he ruled out a phase two trade deal right now, to your quick point here, because phase one just is going nowhere right now. We're waiting for them to deliver the goods, and they're not, right? Real quick. GASPARINO: Yes. I mean, phase one wasn't that big of a deal anyway. It was supposed to be the setup for phase two. But it's the relationship between the two countries now, which has been totally soured by corona, by further talk of espionage. I mean, all's you have to do is look at a music app TikTok, right? CAVUTO: All right. GASPARINO: It's young -- used by young kids. That may be banned because of this. That shows you how far they're going to go in this war -- Neil, back to you. CAVUTO: Oh, it's out of control. All right, thank you, buddy, Charlie Gasparino. We are waiting to hear from the president on this. He will outline all of these plans. Might be an opportunity for him to respond to questions about all these school systems that are delaying their in-person opening. Now, he said that would be a mistake. He no doubt could use this as an opportunity to emphasize that point.

And in the end, it cost her the life of her of her young son. What are your thoughts on what's happening in cities these days?AYALA: I think in cities you have a lot of people that just do not value life at this time. They don't realize that when you take a life that life is not coming back. It's not like TV, you take a life and the guy shows back up in another television show, or another movie. It's not a video game.People feel that if they have a dispute, the only way to handle it is with gun violence. I think we got to get out here and educate young people. More about why they shouldn't be picking up guns, why guns are so violent.And then, when you use a weapon and you actually take somebody's life, you're really not hurting that person emotionally. That person is gone. He's dead. The person that you're hurting is the family members that belongs to that person that you decided to take their life.GALLAGHER: Yes, I think it's a very strong point, sir. And you know, it's interesting because Davon's football coach, he was quoted as saying this. He said, you know, these kids, their lives are being robbed over nothing. And he's right, because last year, Davon's classmate - a classmate of Davon's last summer was also shot and killed. These children in these neighborhoods have got to be afraid to walk outside, sir.AYALA: Yes, I mean, not just last year. We have so many death of young people here in DC. We had another one that was high profile, Makiyah Wilson. She was a 10-year-old girl shot, I believe it was July 22, 2018. She just came out of her house to go get ice cream cone, and five guys jumped out of a vehicle and just started shooting. And she was shot and killed.And then a year later, there was another young man that was not too far away from that distance that was also shot and killed, and he was only 11 years old. And then you got Davon. You know, he gets out the car in front of his aunt's house. And the purpose for getting out the car was to get a charger, just to charge his phone, because the phone was dead. That's how he stays in contact with his other cousins.And he gets out the car. Shots ring. He hits the ground. Crystal's looking, saying get up man, he don't get up. So she goes - see what's going on and realize that he was hit with one of the bullets that were being shot, going in that direction, and she didn't realize it until she got over there.GALLAGHER: Yes, I mean, and these types of heart rending stories, sir, you know, there are at least five other families going through the very same thing right now. I want to put up this quote from Black Lives Matter DC and get your opinion on their side, because I know you're also in law enforcement.It says quoting here, \"That's our neighborhood. Your $533 million budget should be defunded, because you can't keep us our families safe. DC Police Department was around when this happened, as usual. We're beyond fed up with the blood in our streets. How dare you ask Mayor Bowser for more money meant for prevention?\"And I know we mentioned the top that you're had been involved in law enforcement and policing for much of your life. What do you respond to Black Lives Matter when they say things like that, sir?AYALA: OK. And you're right, most of my life I've been a Guardian Angel. I started doing this at the age of 14 in New York City. I came to DC and started the group when I was 19. I'm now 50. And 11 years ago I started a special police company called Archangel Global Security Special Police in Washington DC where we have full police powers. We are law enforcement on the properties that we work.Now for that response. I don't agree that we can't take money from the police department. We need the police. You take the police from there and we wind up having less police officers in the street, less detectives, it's not going to work. The crime is going to get worse.You need police to run those calls. So you just start having less police officers who are going to come when there is a need for police services. But what I will say, we have to find money for the additional services that everybody would like to have.There are calls that come into the police department that should not go to the police. These certain calls to go to other agencies that can deal with maybe mental health, or one of those calls when it comes to ticketing here in DC we have property where officers call - police call - special police or security are called for ticketing instead of calling the police. They can call a company that comes out and ticket cars.The money should go to those different agencies. Where can you get that money from? We have millions of dollars that are generated through red light cameras, speed cameras and other ways we receive money in, in the DC metropolitan area. Why can't we get money and just put it to those agencies?But to remove money from the police department, I think is not good. And also they spoke about taking police and some security out of the schools. That is a big mistake. I'd tell you that one time - I think, a couple of years ago they were talking about let's arm the teachers in the schools and these guys have no good training.But then now you want to take the police officers out of schools. I'm like, Are y'all serious?GALLAGHER: Yes.AYALA: What's going on? So we have another tragedy in the school, you're going to want to put the police back.GALLAGHER: And last thing, sir.AYALA: --You should not take the police out. The police need the funding.GALLAGHER: And I think it's a fair assessment. Lastly, you see, you hear about these crimes. And I know that there have been ceasefires in these neighborhoods over and over again, but they never hold. And you talk about the national spotlight on black crime. Do you believe, sir, that it's getting enough attention in this country?AYALA: I believe it is getting enough attention, it really have. But what I think we still need more organizations and more of us - when I say us, people in the black communities, to start going into the communities and talking to people to prevent the violence that are occurring.We are - also we need to go into the communities after there is something tragic as a shooting and mentor and talk to other young people in the community as well, so we can prevent it from happening in the future. Not just protests when a police officer hurts someone that looks like me.I agree we have to voice our opinion on it, because that's not right. That person should be arrested if he did something wrong. But there's always one bad apple in every organization. But we're going to go after the police officers when they hurt someone that look like me, we need to go after the people that look like me that hurt people that look like me, if you understand what I'm saying.GALLAGHER: I do. Very well said. Mr. Ayala, again, our hearts go out to you and your family for the loss of your grandson. We thank you so much for joining us tonight, sir.AYALA: Thank you for the opportunity.GALLAGHER: Also here tonight Bernard Kerik, former New York Police Commissioner. And Commissioner, I just want to put up this tweet that you sent out today and then you can kind of expound on that, if you would for us.You said, \"Look at their photos. Look really good.\" Speaking, of course of the five children who lost their lives around this country. \"Where are the black lives matter Marxists thugs and extortionists? They are funding the Democratic Party and DNC and those overseeing the cities where these kids were murdered.\" You want to expound on that for us, sir?And there is the picture. And we should look at these closely, because this happened this weekend - five. And there were six or seven, we believe, we are still working in getting their pictures up as well, sir. But your thoughts on what's happening across the country?BERNARD KERIK, FORMER NYPD COMMISSIONER: You know what, Trace, the black lives matter really matter to Black Lives Matter, the organization. You had seven - close to 80 people shot and 14 dead in Chicago. We had 44 shot, six dead in New York. 28 shot, four dead in Atlanta. 20 shot, three dead in Cleveland. I don't see no marches there. I don't see no protest. I don't see no screaming and yelling. I don't see anything for Black Lives Matter.There is a systemic slaughter of black on black members of communities all over the country that are led by Democrats. Those cities are led by Democrats. And if you go - and here's my point to the funding issue.If you go to the Black Lives organization website, and you donate money, it goes to ActBlue. And if you look ActBlue, it's a 501 3(c) that basically gives tens of millions of dollars to the Democratic Party. Where's that money going back to the communities where they oversee these cities that there's this systemic slaughter of blacks. It's got to stop.You know, you were talking to John about policing. The problem we have today, there ain't enough cops. There just aren't enough cops in these communities like Atlanta, like Chicago. There's not enough enforcement as it stands today, that's why you have these crime numbers. They need more resources. They need better manpower, more manpower, that's what they need.GALLAGHER: And we should know the city that you oversaw, crime recently up 205 percent and you have Mayor Bill de Blasio saying that this is part and parcel because of the coronavirus. Saying, quoting that \"the effects of people being cooped up too long.\" Your thoughts on that?KERIK: Delusional, that's what my thoughts are. He cuts 600 men and women out of the plainclothes anti-Crime Unit. That unit solely works on taking guns off the streets, responding to hot jobs, jobs in progress, violent crime in progress. That's what they were designated for. That's what they did. They're like chameleons in plainclothes where they can go into communities and look for guns and real bad guys. He took them off the streets and it's only going to get worse from this point forward, far worse.GALLAGHER: And Commissioner, I'm running low on time. But I think - I want to show this video, because I think it's worth it. This is surveillance video. It captured the moment a man was fatally shot while crossing a Bronx street on Saturday. He was hand in hand with his six-year-old daughter. He died, of course, the daughter is fine. But just, when you see something like this, it is unbelievable to have this happening on the streets of New York City.KERIK: Trace, this is broad daylight, number one. And number two, you know what, 30 years ago Rudy Giuliani and I and other police commissioners turned New York City into the safest large city in the world.Bill de Blasio has knocked it back 30 years - 30 years. Somebody - some things has to change. And I would urge the governor to wake up, stop washing his car or do whatever he's doing in Albany and get to New York City and fix it.GALLAGHER: Former NYPD Police Commissioner Bernie Kerik, good to see you, sir. I appreciate it.KERIK: Thank you.GALLAGHER: Well, a short time ago, Vice President Pence leading a Coronavirus Task Force meeting in the Situation Room as COVID cases rise in 32 states. Dr. Scott Atlas says the rising numbers are no cause for panic. And he's next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)GALLAGHER: Vice President Mike Pence convening a White House Coronavirus Task Force meeting late today amid a spike in New COVID-19 cases in 32 states. Texas and Florida, especially hard hit. Both hitting record case numbers over the holiday weekend. And Texas now setting a new record in hospitalizations as of tonight.White House Correspondent Kevin Cork is following the latest from Washington, Kevin?KEVIN CORKE, FOX NEWS WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Evening Trace. There is little doubt this is an administration effort to show that, yes, it is paying attention to this latest spike in cases by having more taskforce meetings.But it's also clear that at least for now, it is not on a wartime footing that should keep the country from reopening the economy, because as we've also heard the President say on a number of occasions, positive cases doesn't mean a spike in the death rate, and ultimately that is what is important.The Vice President talking about it in a tweet he said, there was a very good meeting of the White House Coronavirus Task Force today. He said, \"As we see cases rise in some areas, we are ensuring states have exactly what they need to respond to the increase. We'll continue to put the health of the American people first and we'll get through this together.\"That tweet, of course, coming after a barrage of tweets by the President today in which he described the expanded testing in our country is one of the principal reasons for the recent spike in cases. Also noting that the mortality rate continues to fall. Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany who was actually asked about that today at the White House press briefing.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)KAYLEIGH MCENANY, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: So what the President was pointing to, and I'm glad you brought it up, was a factual statement. One that is rooted in science and one that was pointing out the fact that mortality in this country is very low. No one wants to see anyone in this country contract COVID, which is why the administration has fought hard to make sure that's not the case with our historic response effort.(END VIDEO CLIP)CORK: And while it is true that the death rate continues to fall, the increase in hospitalizations, as you mentioned, is of great concern. In fact, so much so, that some states, including Texas, Florida, and Arizona had begun to roll back some of their relaxed restrictions. Trace?GALLAGHER: Yes. Indeed, they are. Kevin Cork live for us in Washington. Kevin, thank you.With us now, Dr. Scott Atlas. He's a Senior Fellow at Stanford University's Hoover Institution and former Chief of Neuroradiology at Stanford University Medical Center. Dr. Atlas, always good to see you. I'm curious, when you come out and you say that there is no reason to panic. What what's the premise for that, sir?SCOTT ATLAS, MD, SENIOR FELLOW, HOOVER INSTITUTION: Well, first of all, there's no reason to panic by any public official were they're disqualifying themselves from their position. But the data is what I want to talk about.And when we see this focus on more cases, it doesn't really matter how many cases. It only matters who gets the cases. Because we know the infection fatality rate for people under 70 is 0.04 percent on the latest analysis, that's less than or equal to seasonal flu. The cases themselves should not be and we're never the focus. It's only the tragic consequences of the cases.So when we look at these new cases in every state, the overwhelming majority are younger, healthier people. I think in Florida the median age is 36. In Texas, it's something similar or maybe 40. And that's really what we're thinking about here. Is that it only matters if we cannot protect the high risk people, which we are protecting.We're protecting - how do I know? Because the death rates are not going up. Actually, we realize we have to wait to have the story play out here. But right now, the cases have been going up for three weeks. We have no increase. In fact, we have a decrease in death rates. So, it doesn't matter if you get the illness if you're going to fully recover and be fine from it and that is what people must understand. For younger, healthier people, there's not a high risk from this disease at all.GALLAGHER: And it's interesting to me, because, you know, you talk about the death rate. And, you know, I know it's a lagging indicator, but a lot of these tests are lagging indicators. Some people are not getting their test results for 7, 8, 9 days. And so, these death rates are only lagging by a few days.In consistent, when you say the more cases that if they're getting younger people, it's a good thing. When the CDC comes out and says, 10 times the number of people who are - who have been confirmed to had COVID-19, that's probably the amount that had it. We applaud those numbers like that's a great thing, because that lowers the case fatality rate. But when we talk about new cases, everybody tends to panic a little bit.ATLAS: Well, and that's true. And I think that there's something else that goes on spoken. That is that when you have a lot of low risk people get the infection, that's how you generate population immunity. This is the so called herd immunity.People have been really mistaken about the number of people by the way that have had immunity, because immunity is not just based on antibodies. It's based on a larger number of people who had something called T cell immunity.But I do want to comment on the hospitalizations, because when you look more than superficially at data, which is necessary and should be demanded from our public health officials. When you look at Texas, for instance, yes, they have a lot of people in the hospital.But when I looked at every single hospital area in Texas today, 15 to 20 percent of people in the hospital as in-patients are COVID positive patients. That means 80 to 85 percent have nothing to do with COVID-19. And the same thing goes for some of these other states. There are people hospitalized a large number, because they're tested as COVID positive, somehow they're categorized as COVID hospitalizations. That's a problem.GALLAGHER: Yes. I'm it's interesting, because you're exactly right. When you see headlines in the Los Angeles Times, the Riverside County Hospital is 99 percent capacity. Then you read into the article, only 30 percent are COVID patients, it's a little misleading.I want to put these numbers on the screen, the Gallup poll, because it says that people are concerned. If you look at this, you get 19 percent are very worried about the lack of social distancing totaling 54 percent, because 35 percent are moderately worried. The case numbers go up, Dr. Atlas, and you say not to panic, but clearly we're doing something wrong.ATLAS: Well, what we're doing wrong is we have the wrong people in charge of our states, because they don't seem to understand it's not the superficial analysis that counts. And when they make the error that they should be beyond now of not consolidating the data in a critical manner, they need to communicate to people what the facts are. It's not a time to panic. It's not a high risk disease for people under 70. It's certainly not a high risk disease for people under 30 or 40, who almost all recover. So we have to look at that.And by the way, these policies of slight reopening in some of these states that does not even correlate time wise to these new cases. What correlates to the new cases, if it's from social mingling is the large protests that were in these large cities, somehow that goes unspoken. It's not the guy getting his hair cut in the barber shop that created all these thousands of cases. That's ridiculous.GALLAGHER: And the data is starting to lean that way. Dr. Scott Atlas, good of you to join us, sir. Thank you.ATLAS: OK, thank you.GALLAGHER: Well, President Trump tweeting today, \"China has caused great damage to the United States and the rest of the world.\" He's now weighing executive action to hold Beijing accountable for COVID's toll in the U.S. White House Trade Advisor Peter Navarro coming up right after this.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We got hit by the virus that came from China. China secrecy, deceptions, and cover up allowed it to spread all over the world 189 countries. And China must be held fully accountable.(END VIDEO CLIP)GALLAGHER: With more than 130,000 Americans lives lost and millions of others struggling to survive financially, President Trump could soon take action to hold China accountable for COVID-19 spread in the U.S.With us now on what that might look like, White House trade advisor, Peter Navarro. Sir, it's always good of you to join us.PETER NAVARRO, WHITE HOUSE TRADE ADVISER: Good evening, Trace.GALLAGHER: We see the president and the administration placing a lot of blame on China and people are beginning to wonder when the finger-pointing will stop and the consequences will start. Your thoughts?NAVARRO: Well, let's give it some historical context to understand what can and should be done. For the last 20 years, China has cheated in trade and Americans lost their jobs. Millions and millions and millions of jobs.President Trump was the first president to stand up to that and one of the primary ways he has been able to recover some of those damages and defend American workers is through his tough tariff policy. So, we got China cheats, American lose their jobs.In this case, what we have is the Chinese Communist Party line going back to November when they first span the virus in December and January when they hit the virus. December, January, February, when they were sending the virus around in aircraft to this country. So the CPP lied and so far over 130,000 Americans have died.GALLAGHER: Right.NAVARRO: And I think, Trace, what's really important is we've got a lot of anger, anxiety, and fear because of the China virus out there. It's being directed against each other but there is no -- there is no party affiliation on the death certificate. This is not a domestic battle.GALLAGHER: Right.NAVARRO: What we need to understand is that it's China, the Chinese Communist Party that is doing this to us. So what we do about that.GALLAGHER: Yes.NAVARRO: Well, first of all, let's take Hong Kong as a microcosm of that. For years, for years, we allowed China to use Hong Kong as a way to basically exploit our financial markets and steal our jobs by using it as a platform for trade practices.Soon, President Trump has already announced in May 29th in the Rose Garden we're going to strip every preferential treatment of Hong Kong away which will essentially eliminate China's ability to use Hong Kong to harm us --GALLAGHER: Right.NAVARRO: -- even as we're standing up for the great people of Hong Kong --(CROSSTALK)GALLAGHER: If we can -- if we can --NAVARRO: -- who are seeing (Inaudible)democracy --GALLAGHER: -- sir, get back to the consequences part of this whole thing. I'm curious as the consequences. Because White House --(CROSSTALK)NAVARRO: Well, it has a big consequence.GALLAGHER: -- chief of staff -- hold on one second, sir.NAVARRO: Yes.GALLAGHER: I apologize.NAVARRO: Sure.GALLAGHER: White House chief of staff Mark Meadows saying the president is going to, you know, implement some executive orders this week dealing with China, dealing with immigration and prescription drug prices. Will that executive order with China have an impact on the trade deal?NAVARRO: The trade deal remains intact according to Ambassador Lighthizer and Secretary Mnuchin. We're watching very, very carefully to see whether they fulfill the items there. And to be honest right now, the purchases are lagging but we believe that they will catch up by the end of the year if they keep their word.But this is, Trace, this is about a lot more than a trade deal, it wasn't merely a trade deal. It was about getting China to stop stealing our intellectual property, forcing technology transfer and things like that. And we know now that even as we speak, they're trying to steal the intellectual property for vaccine development for the China virus.So, again, I don't want to get ahead of the president or the chief of staff but there will be a series of actions taken over the next several weeks that will hold China accountable for the damage that it is doing to the American people. And don't forget, even as we speak, they are waging information warfare against this country trying to --(CROSSTALK)GALLAGHER: I got to go, sir.NAVARRO: -- sow these divisions.GALLAGHER: I got to go. But I want to quickly get your -- you're taking this on June 22nd you told this show the trade deal was over. You are asked, is it over? You said it's over. Is it over?(CROSSTALK)NAVARRO: I did not -- I did not say that, what I said that Trump in the Chinese Communist Party with respect to them was over so it's a case where we trust but we verify. And unfortunately --(CROSSTALK)GALLAGHER: Let me just --NAVARRO: -- that was as far spending went out on --GALLAGHER: Let me just play this for you, sir and then -- let me play you exactly what was said.NAVARRO: Well, as you play the tape --GALLAGHER: Let me play you exactly what was said. Go ahead, I'm going to play it back for you --NAVARRO: Sure.GALLAGHER: -- and you can listen to it and then respond.NAVARRO: Sure.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MARTHA MACCALLUM, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Do you think that the president sort of -- I mean, he obviously really wanted to hang onto this trade deal as much as possible. And he wanted them to make good on the promises because there had been progress made on that trade deal. But given everything that's happened and all the things you just listed, is not over?NAVARRO: It's over, yes.(END VIDEO CLIP)GALLAGHER: What --(CROSSTALK)NAVARRO: Clearly, was that the trust in the Chinese Communist Party is over. Going forward in this relationship, they cannot be trusted. We have to hold them accountable. And that's what we are going to be doing with this president, the toughest president on the Chinese Communist Party that we have ever seen.GALLAGHER: White House trade advisor, Peter Navarro, always good for you to join us, sir. Thank you.NAVARRO: Thank you, Trace.GALLAGHER: Well, Karl Rove and Chris Hahn on whether Kanye West presidential bid could spell bad news for Biden. Next.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: Can you answer this question? You're in the Oval Office.KANYE WEST, RAPPER: I'm here.TRUMP: How does it feel to be in the Oval Office?WEST: It is good energy in this.TRUMP: You feel good energy?WEST: It's a good energy.TRUMP: It's a great place.(END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)GALLAGHER: Well, Kanye West taking to Twitter on July 4th to announce he is running for president. It's at least the third time the rapper has done so over the past five years. And while the nearly impossible feat could be a publicity stunt, there is also speculation it's a plot to help President Trump get reelected.National correspondent Jacqui Heinrich has the story. Jacqui?JACQUI HEINRICH, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Trace, there's speculation over whether this is a legitimate run or a broader ploy to help either President Trump or former Vice President Joe Biden win. It's not the first time Kanye has floated the idea. In 2015 at the MTV Video Music Awards he said he would run in 2020. Then last year, he said he'd run in 2020 for possibly under the name of Christian genius billionaire Kanye West.But since his tweet Saturday Kanye has reportedly not filed with a federal election commission or created the campaign committee. Kanye has a friendly relationship with President Trump. He's been invited to the Oval Office where he said his MAGA hat makes him feel like superman.In 2018, he tweeted his love for the president defending his right to independent thought and saying they have dragon energy. And this past April he implied he would vote for the president. And there's been criticism Kanye's run would help President Trump's campaign like it's been argued Jill Stein's candidacy cost Hillary Clinton the election in 2016. Pulling significant enough support in swing states, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin.Critics also say he could siphon support away from former Vice President Joe Biden who is broadly supported by black voters. A YouGov/Huffington Post poll from 2015 showed 25 percent of black Americans said they would consider voting for Kanye.But a second poll from the same company three years later after Kanye began praising Trump showed a shift in public opinion with 9 percent of black American saying they had a favorable opinion of Kanye versus 20 percent of whites and 34 percent of Republicans. Lending credence to the converse theory that a Kanye run could pull support away from President Trump through possibly white and Republican supporters.But his first obstacle will be getting on the ballot. Kanye is also about to release a new album so there's also speculation that this is just a publicity stunt. Trace?GALLAGHER: Yes. Jacqui Heinrich live for us in New York. Jacqui, thank you.With us now, Karl Rove, former deputy chief of staff under President George W. Bush and Fox News contributor, and Chris Hahn, former aide to Senator Chuck Schumer and a syndicated radio host. Gentlemen, thank you both. Karl, I guess it's a point to be had. I mean, critics are saying look, any vote not for Joe Biden is a a vote for Donald Trump. So, there is a something to the whole Kanye West thing. Agreed?KARL ROVE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: No, there's not. This is a stunt. Look, he can't be on the ballot in North Carolina, Indiana, New Mexico, Texas. Those deadlines have already passed. In order to be on the ballot in Nevada he has to submit 9,608 signatures of Nevada voters by next Monday -- or excuse me, by Friday.Next week he has to get 160,000 signatures in Delaware, Florida, and Illinois to be on the ballot. In Michigan and New York by the end of the month he's got to get another 42,000 signatures.This is a stunt. He will not be filing this way with the Federal Election Commission. The only states that he runs a chance of being on the ballot are Oklahoma if he puts in $35,000 in cash by the 15th of the month or in August when he can pays -- he could pay $500 to get on the ballot in Louisiana and $1,000 to get in Colorado. This is a stunt and we are wasting people's time with it.GALLAGHER: Chris, you know, Karl makes a good point, Chris. Because the truth is, you know, he has spent zero time collecting signatures but a lot of time promoting this album and promoting his clothing line. Your thoughts?CHRIS HAHN, FORMER AIDE TO SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER: You know, it's been a couple of weeks since Karl and I have agreed fully but he is absolutely right. I even enjoyed watching him with his white board tonight which I don't normally do. So good work, Karl. I agree with you a 100 percent. This is a complete stunt.Kanye should stick to doing when he does best of making art. He is an artist. We've all enjoyed his work over the years. I don't enjoy his politics, and quite frankly, I think we are wasting time talking about it and it is absolutely a stunt. And we'll see how the album is, it might be pretty good.GALLAGHER: It might be pretty good. I mean, some of them have been fantastic. So, we have kind of taken off --HAHN: Yes.GALLAGHER: -- Kanye West for president. Let's move to vice president. Susan Rice as the V.P candidate gaining momentum, Karl?ROVE: Well, this is the point in which we talked about people and they gain momentum because we talked about them. Interesting from two angles, my perspective.One is in 20 -- in 2008, Joe Biden was sold in part as the vice- presidential running mate for Barack Obama because he had experience in foreign policy. Now we're talking about Susan Rice. Is she being talked about because she has experience with foreign policy that Joe Biden needs on the ticket? Interesting question.Second thing is, she's an accomplished individual. She is a serious person. And if she were chosen, she'd meet that standard that hard to define standard of, we think she's capable of doing the job if something bad happened to Biden. But she will inject, reinject a familiar issue into the race. She was the national security advisor for President Obama when Hunter Biden went on the board of Burisma.GALLAGHER: Yes.ROVE: And that same year Joe Biden was put in charge of anticorruption efforts on Ukraine. I've discussed this issue with her.GALLAGHER: Yes.ROVE: And she does not have a good answer. Did they know about Hunter Biden going on the board?HAHN: Well --ROVE: Did they have the White House any discombobulation? Did she have a conversation with Joe Biden and say you better do something about it? No good answer on any of this stuff.GALLAGHER: Right. And then there's Benghazi, Chris. The answer going on The Five the Sunday morning show saying it was all about an internet video. And then there's the Oval Office meeting in January of 2017 that involved Joe Biden and Comey. A lot of other questions at stake here. Your final thoughts, Chris?HAHN: There will be -- there will be nothing that stop Donald Trump from trying to bring Hunter Biden into this campaign. It will fail like just his campaign is going to fail. Just like he's failed America, just like he's failing on coronavirus and the economy.Look, whoever the Democrats pick our Joe Biden picks to be his running mate, they are going to be under serious attack by the right. So, buckle up. I think Susan Rice is a very accomplished person who would be an excellent vice president but there are a lot of people out there who would be an excellent vice president. And by August, we'll know.GALLAGHER: We will know. Chris Hahn, Karl Rove, gentlemen, good of you both. Thank you.HAHN: Thank you.ROVE: You bet.GALLAGHER: Well, Georgia Governor Brian Kemp declaring a state of emergency tonight after more than 20 people were shot and five killed in a single night including this little girl. Secoriea Turner, just eight years old and now her father is asking didn't her life matter?(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SECORIYA WILLIAMSON, SECORIEA TURNER'S FATHER: They say black lives matter. You killed your own. You killed your own this time.(END VIDEO CLIP)GALLAGHER: Jack Brewer and Wendy Osefo when THE STORY continues. Next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)GALLAGHER: Up to 1,000 National Guard troops are being deployed to keep the peace in Georgia where the governor has declared a state of emergency in response to a dramatic rise in violent crime. And the holiday weekend that saw more than 30 gunshot victims. One of them killed. Eight-year-old Secoriea Turner shot while in the car with her mother. And here is her father speaking out.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)WILLIAMSON: They say black lives matter. You killed your own. You killed your own this time. Just because of a barrier. They killed my baby because she crossed a barrier and made a U-turn. You killed a child. She didn't do nothing to nobody.(END VIDEO CLIP)GALLAGHER: Joining me now, Jack Brewer, former Minnesota Vikings player now CEO of the Brewer Group, and Wendy Osefo, founder and CEO of the 1954 Equity Project and professor of education at The Johns Hopkins University.Welcome to you both. I mean, that father sound bite is about as heartrending as it gets, Jack. You say -- you say that President Trump needs to get more involved in protecting the inner cities. How exactly, sir?JACK BREWER, CEO, THE BREWER GROUP INC.: It's time to federalize the National Guard. I mean, Eisenhower did it in 1955, JFK did it in 1962. I want every American to step back for a second and think about your town and city and think if you had 100 of your citizens, children, women, men, killed in shot on weekends.We knew this was going to happen. This has happened in Chicago in inner cities across this country and every Fourth of July. At what -- at what time is it? When is enough, enough? We call ourselves conservatives but then we just point a finger at poor Democratic leadership. We know they have poor leadership. We know they passed demonic satanic policies. That doesn't matter. Those are our brothers and sisters that are sitting in those communities. It's time for us to take a stand, and President Trump needs to do something now. This is a national crisis.GALLAGHER: Though critics point out that he got a lot of pushback when he talked about sending the National Guard and then militarizing after the protests. Wendy, I want your take on this. Because you say that, you know, black lives matter means that all black lives matter. And I'm curious if you think that the organization should have a bigger presence in places like Atlanta and Chicago where the black on black crime is growing exponentially at times?WENDY OSEFO, FOUNDER & CEO, 1954 EQUITY PROJECT: Black lives does matter, but you know, Trace, I want to be very clear and when you say black on black crime. Black people, yes, absolutely. When it comes to murder, they are more than likely to be killed by their fellow black man.However, white people when it comes to murder are more than likely to be killed by white people. So, if we are going to talk about black on black crime let's also talk about white on white crime because black on black crime is used as a strawman to deviate from the issue here.So, yes, black lives does matter. Black lives do matter, absolutely. But we cannot start to pull away from the movement by now trying to use black on black crime as a basic narrative. That little girl, that eight-year-old girl, her life mattered. What is going on in Atlanta cannot continue to go on.But those are two separate issues. America has multiple pandemics going on. We have people dying from police officers, we have coronavirus, and we have crime that happening amongst our citizens. But let's not conflate the two because black lives do matter.GALLAGHER: Yes. And you make a very fair point with a white on white crime as well, Wendy. And I want to bring in Jack on this. Because, Jack, you say the left has succeeded in manipulating the realities of our politics. And now it's time for conservatives to spread the word of God, to start spreading the word of God in this. And what do you mean by that, sir? Quickly, we're running low on time.BREWER: Amen. If you look, we've lost our fear of God that's why if you can go out and kill each other like we are seeing as a police officer roughly can step on the man's neck. We got to get back to spirituality and hold ourselves accountable. We keep talking about race. We need to be talking about one blood. That is what we celebrate here in America.And so, we all need to stand up against this. Again, look within ourselves. Conservatives, it's time to stop preaching hate and start talking about love. Even though we disagree with people who abort so many babies they don't protect the unborn, they don't protect the born, let's pray for them. They are our brothers and sisters too, that's the only way that we heal and move on as a nation as if we truly become one nation under God in Jesus name.GALLAGHER: Thank you. Wendy, the last word to you about 25 seconds.OSEFO: We have to make sure that whatever we're doing is going to move our nation forward and it's inclusive of all people. That means black people, that means trans people, that means the LGBTQQIA plus community. We have to move forward absolutely as one nation.GALLAGHER: Yes. Wendy Osefo, Jack Brewer, good conversation. Thank you both. More of THE STORY coming up right after this.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)GALLAGHER: Well, that is \"The Story\" of Monday, July 6, 2020. We hope you had a great holiday weekend. As always, \"The Story\" continues. We'll see you again tomorrow night at seven.

I'm Laura Ingraham. This is \"The Ingraham Angle\" from another busy, busy Washington. Mollie Hemingway, Ben Shapiro, both will be here in moments to react to the abomination that was that Bill Barr hearing today.Also tonight, doctors vilified and censored for telling their COVID treatment stories. What's going on there? One of the doctors who organized yesterday's now infamous event is here exclusively.And Senator Josh Hawley takes apart big pharma - oh I can't wait for this - after one major drug company issued a threat after the President's executive order to lower drug prices.But first, berating Barr, befriending rioters, that's the focus of Tonight's Angle.Over the past month or so, the Angle has been telling you that there's virtually no distance between the mobs in Portland and Seattle trying to burn down federal buildings and the Democrats on Capitol Hill. And once again, they've proved our point.For several hours today, we saw the mobsters at work, but they weren't outside the building. They were inside, verbally, viciously attacking one of the most well respected legal minds in America, our Attorney General Bill Barr.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. JERROLD NADLER, D-N.Y.: Shame on you, Mr. Barr.WILLIAM BARR, ATTORNEY GENERAL: Can I just say, Mr...NADLER: Shame on you.REP. HAKEEM JEFFRIES, D-N.Y.: You have consistently undermined democracy, undermined the constitution and undermined the health, safety and well- being of the American people.REP. CEDRIC RICHMOND, D-LA.: When you all came here and brought your top staff, he brought no black people. That, sir, is systematic racism.REP. DAVID CICILLINE, D-R.I.: Your failure to respect the role of peaceful protest in this country is a disgrace. It's un-American.REP. PRAMILA JAYAPAL, D-WA.: Mr. Barr, I just asked for a yes or no. So let me just tell you - I'm starting to lose my temper - this is my time and I control it.REP. STEVE COHEN, D-TENN.: I introduced H.Res. 1032 which would require this committee to investigate your conduct as Attorney General and determine whether you should be impeached.(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM: For the record, Barr's character, his reputation, his credentials are unimpeachable. I can't say the same for those folks. Now, I certainly couldn't say the same for any of the Democrat loud mouths hurling insults at him. Now, lest you forget what's been happening in major American cities, here's a reminder.(VIDEO PLAYING)INGRAHAM: The Democrats on the Judiciary Committee today however need you to see something very different.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)NADLER: The protesters aren't mobs, they are mothers and veterans, mayors.COHEN: We've seen mothers and we've seen veterans who are peacefully protesting, not threatening the federal courthouse, beaten and gassed.CICILLINE: And the vast majority of the protesters are peaceful.REP. DEBBIE MUCARSEL-POWELL, D-FLA.: Most of the protests have been peaceful, Mr. Barr, you know that.(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM: Now we have right now in this country what appears to be a very organized effort by thousands of people across the country to create chaos and undermine our faith in the rule of law.And the Democrats, you watched them today, they just do not care. Now they're either wilfully and purposefully ignoring the dangers to our entire system or they're willing to let it all burn just to beat Donald Trump. Now, Barr who's seen a lot in his career could hardly believe what was on unfolding.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BARR: Member of this committee, regardless of your political views, should condemn violence against federal officers. I see some of these Latin American countries in Central America where the police are very, very brave because the gangs they are trying to deal with go to their houses and kill their families. You never think that could happen here, but you could never think some of the stuff we're seeing today could ever happen here.(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM: But it is happening here and it's happening because Democrat Mayors, Governors, Senators and those Congressmen have made a concerted decision to side with the very radicals who are threatening the lives of innocent Americans. They're doing it on interstate freeways, on bridges, in federal buildings, and frankly, anywhere where rioters gather.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BARR: Since when is it okay to try to burn down a federal court? If someone went down the street to the Prettyman Court here, that beautiful courthouse we have right at the bottom of the hill and started breaking windows and firing industrial grade fireworks in to start a fire, throw kerosene balloons in, and start fires in the court, is that okay? Is that okay now? No, the U.S. Marshals have a duty to stop that and defend the courthouse, and that's what we are doing in Portland.(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM: Now, make no mistake, this is no longer the Democrat Party of Bill Clinton. It's not even the party of Barack Obama. This is the party of Alexandria-Ocasio Cortez, Ilhan Omar, Ayanna Pressley, the squad. This is the party of Antifa. This is the party of radical anarchists and revolutionaries who commit any crime against any person or any piece of property in order to get their way.And what's stunning to watch is that these domestic terrorists have become in their own way an active feature of the Biden campaign, got to keep up the chaos, try to provoke a reaction from federal law enforcement, all to affect the outcome of a Presidential Election. And Judiciary Committee Democrats are taking cues from these despicable people, performing for a television audience, attempting to carry out what was the equivalent of reputational assassination of Bill Barr.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. MADELEINE DEAN, D-PA.: Have you now called for law enforcement to stop using these chemical irritants on protesters? Yes or no?BARR: Pepper spray?DEAN: Yes.BARR: No.DEAN: No?BARR: I think it's a very important non-lethal option.DEAN: For protesters?BARR: No, for rioters.DEAN: Sir, that was my question, for protesters.BARR: No, for rioters.DEAN: Yes. Sir, America was founded on the principles of free speech.BARR: When people resist law enforcement, they're not peaceful.DEAN: Reclaiming my time. I'm surprised at your lack of respect for a member of Congress.(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM: I laughed out loud in my kitchen when I saw that today. The gentle lady was treated with more deference in that exchange than she deserved. She took her five minutes to launch a personal attack on a man with an impeccable record.Like her colleague, she dissembled, distorted and demonized for purely political ends and her little charade for the cameras isn't just an example of conduct that is boorish and rude, but it's an insult to the integrity and history of the entire House of Representatives.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)POWELL: What am I supposed to say to my constituents when they ask me if the government has done everything in its power to protect their loved ones from dying?BARR: I would tell them that managing this kind of thing requires a lot of difficult choices, of weighing different consequences.(CROSSTALK)POWELL: I'm not going to lie. I am not going to lie to my constituents. I am going to tell them that President Donald Trump and the Attorney General working together are letting Americans die needlessly because of political reasons.(CROSSTALK)REP. MIKE JOHNSON, R-LA.: Is it permissible for a member of this committee to accuse a sitting Attorney General of the United States of murder, because that's what we just heard.NADLER: The members control the time.JOHNSON: Mr. Chairman, to say whatever they want? What about rules of decorum?(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM: Rules of decorum? Those went unfortunately out the window a long time ago. And after all their preening and strutting and overcharged emoting, the Democrats sought to deprive Barr his one brief moment of humanity.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BARR: I have two children who are cancer survivors, so I feel very strongly about this issue as a matter of policy, and I believe that the President has made clear that he will ensure that they--(CROSSTALK)REP. LUCY MCBATH, D-GA.: Sir, please answer my question, will you stop playing politics with Americans' health care in the middle of a pandemic?(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM: Everyone should understand where we are. As mob violence consumes the country, we're in the middle of this COVID crisis, Democrats on Capitol Hill prefer to berate the chief law enforcement official in the country and float far left conspiracy theories rather than working with him to restore order and maybe just give people a little hope.And why are Democrats doing this? Why was there not a single reason question from even one of them today? Because they know that AOC and the squad will destroy them if they deviate from the far left playbook for just a millisecond. The Democrats are more terrified of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez plus three because they're worried about her endorsing a primary challenger. They're worried more about that than what any reasonable American thinks.Ever since the impeachment effort failed, the Democrats have jumped on one crazy theory after another. Barr is a thoughtful and dedicated civil servant. He came out of retirement, not because he wanted something on his resume. He's already done everything. He did it because he has a profound sense of duty to this country. He and the American people deserve better. And don't imagine that Biden is going to stop the lawlessness in our cities, by the way,(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOE BIDEN (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I'd be using local police as we did, when we were in office. When there were riots and our federal property at stake, we were able to take care of that and were able to take care of it by the use of (inaudible) obviously the use of local police.(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM: Oh, really? Here's what Obama and Biden accomplished in Baltimore.(VIDEO PLAYING)INGRAHAM: They did nothing except let Baltimore and St. Louis, Ferguson burn, and electing Biden is going to make scenes like these play out in a neighborhood near you. And for those looking to, I don't know, for some comfort, some moderation, some sanity, Biden only offers an assurance to the far left and the AOC wing of his party.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BIDEN: If I'm elected and this passes, I'm going to be good to go down as the most progressive President in the American history.(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM: Not bad. You're also going to be good to go down as one of the most manipulated and passive Presidents in American history. My goodness, think of Bill Barr and what he had to endure today and then think of Biden running the show, oh, sorry, whoever his Vice-President and the old Obama alums running the show. God help us, and that's the angle.Alright, joining me now is Ben Shapiro, Editor in Chief of The Daily Wire and author of \"How to Destroy America,\" we're seeing that play out. Also with me Mollie Hemingway, Senior Editor at The Federalist, Fox News contributor.Ben, as loathsome as these characters on the left were at today's hearing, and also it really just showed us how intellectually morally bankrupt Democrats in Congress are right now. There is no decency. There's no dignity despite Biden invoking that word several times during his event today.BEN SHAPIRO, AUTHOR, HOW TO DESTROY AMERICA: It was a moral absurdity. The Democrats resembled nothing so much as a bunch of corgis attempting to strip a basketball while going after William Barr. It was just ridiculous from beginning to end.And the fact that Barr, who is a public servant, who has been around since the Reagan administration was treated this way, it's a good reminder that when President Trump says, \"They're not coming after me, they're coming after you\" to his supporters, he's right about that because Barr is generic arc (ph). He is not Donald Trump.He is just a normal run of the mill, very intelligent Republican conservative. And they went after him as though he were Donald Trump, which means they'll come after virtually anybody so long as that person opposes the radical left's agenda.INGRAHAM: Mollie, I think Ben's point is something that we have to state over and over again. So people take this away from Trump's tweets or his personality or he rubs you the wrong way sometimes. This is about the American people and how they tried to push around a man who is twice Attorney General of the United States.That's what they're going to do to the average - imagine what they'll do to the average citizen if they have the Justice Department back and all these federal agencies with investigatory power, imagine what they'll do.MOLLIE HEMINGWAY, SENIOR EDITOR, THE FEDERALIST: Imagine what they'll do and also it's what they were unable to do with Barr because this is a man in full possession of his faculties. He's had a full professional career. He brings a lot of experience and wisdom and gravitas. He is a statesman.He is actually able to handle what Democrats are throwing at him. But if they are to turn their - that same sort of hate and viciousness against a typical Republican, I think a lot of people understand that's what they want to do and it's what they will do if they have more power.In many ways, what we saw today was probably the best example of the choice facing American voters. There is a group of Democrats, a large group of Democrats who are unwilling to condemn violence against federal buildings and federal law enforcement officers, destruction of city centers, arson, looting, assault.They're unable to condemn those things. In fact they defend those things and they instead attack the people who are attempting to restore law and order to these places. That is a very visceral choice facing American voters and that was on full display today.INGRAHAM: And this was Ben, I guess Nancy Pelosi came out today, and she had this as usual trenchant analysis of the Barr hearing today.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. NANCY PELOSI, D-CALIF.: It demonstrated to the American people the contempt that he has for our democracy. He should be answering for what he did at Lafayette Square, a disgrace. So this is really, he was like a blob. He was like a just henchman for The President of the United States.(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM: Henchman? Ben, she has now morphed into Ilhan Omar. I mean is there really any difference between Nancy Pelosi and any member of the squad, or frankly any member of Antifa? Really? I can't believe I'm saying this, but they're all one and the same.SHAPIRO: Yes. She was assimilated into the Borg last year when she refused to actually pass that resolution specifically condemning Ilhan Omar and then did a photo shoot with Ilhan Omar on the cover of Rolling Stone by the way. The innate ridiculousness of Nancy Pelosi claiming that Bill Barr is a threat to democracy, while simultaneously the entirety - virtually the entirety of the Democratic Party is claiming that federal law enforcement officers enforcing the law is military tyranny.It's ridiculous on its face and it's disgusting because again, they're saving their most rabid language for federal law enforcement officers. We've heard sitting Congress people on the Democratic side suggest that these people who are serving us and protecting us and standing between the villains and civilization, we've heard them called the Gestapo. We have heard them called tyrants. We we've heard the suggestion that they are in fact the threat in these cities.If that's the line they're going to pursue, I think sooner or later Americans are going to fight back against this, obviously non-violently. They're going to go to the ballot box and they're going to reflect the idea that most Americans are not willing to go along with their cities burning just to make Democrats feel good about themselves.INGRAHAM: Yes. That's why we are going to get to this later. That's why there's so much censorship from big tech. They don't want people to see the images that we're showing tonight on The Ingraham Angle. And Mollie, what got very little coverage of course is what Barr said, forcefully pushing back against claims that he's under pressure from The President in prosecutions or other criminal investigations. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BARR: The President has not attempted to interfere in these decisions. On the contrary, he has told me from the start that he expects me to exercise my independent judgment to make whatever call I think is right and that is precisely what I've done.(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM: Mollie, do remember anyone on the left charging Holder - Eric Holder with running interference even after he said - he actually said he was Obama's wingman. They weren't worried about that one bit.HEMINGWAY: They weren't at all. The reason why people don't like Attorney General William Barr is because he is attempting to hold people accountable for one of the most lawless things that has been done in the history of the country, if not the most - one of the most horrible things, which was this Russia collusion hoax, an attempt to take down the elected President of the country, to harm international relations, and to use it, to use all the tools of the intelligence services to do this.That was a horrible thing and Barr has said it clearly, and that's why they don't like him. But what's so galling about today is if you saw any pressure, it's not coming from people who are asking, it's not enough pressure coming from people who are asking for accountability. And it's all coming from people who are demanding that he stop, that he allow that lawlessness to continue, and that they be allowed to get away with what they did. And that is where the pressure is coming from.INGRAHAM: Yes, Ben and Mollie, they burned the Pfizer process, they burned the rule of law, they burned impeachment, all these investigations and now they will allow cities to burn, all to get rid of Trump. That has got to wake up the American voters. I certainly hope so.Both of you, your analysis tonight, so important. Thank you very much. And I had a tale of two liberal cities. Again, consumed by mayhem and their own leaders who seem completely unable or more accurately unwilling to stop the burning. In Seattle, an investigative journalist takes us inside how the city is going further than any other in bringing about the collapse of law and order. And in Chicago, we speak exclusively to the man who'll take on corrupt Cook County DA. You remember her; Kim Foxx. Stay there.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)INGRAHAM: Liberal cities across the country are being terrorized by chaos and lawlessness, especially in the Pacific Northwest. Now last night, we told you about the violence in Portland, a city that has looked like a scene out of Mad Max for the past two months. But tonight, we look at Seattle, the CHOP Autonomous Zone may be gone, but the radicals controlling the city are looking to continue its legacy.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)ANGELICA CHAZARO, PROFESSOR, UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON: In order to actually transform the way the city does public safety, we need to shrink the current police force.KSHAMA SAWANT, COUNCILWOMAN, SEATTLE: We are coming to dismantle this deeply oppressive, racist, sexist, violent, utterly bankrupt system of capitalism, this police state.MAYOR JENNY DURKAN, D-SEATTLE: It looks like this President is doing a dress rehearsal for martial law, sending in federal forces to take over police duties in city after city for political purposes.(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM: Now, my next guest says Seattle is going further than any other American city right now and deconstructing the entire justice system. The rule of law, it's shot there. Joining me now is Christopher Rufo, City Journal Contributing Editor.Now, Christopher, tell us what your sources and I know they're good, in the Seattle Police Department are confiding about what's really happening, the truth of what's happening in that city?CHRISTOPHER RUFO, CONTRIBUTING EDITOR, CITY JOURNAL: So right now, within the entire justice system in the city of Seattle, people are at a full blown panic. The Seattle City Council is currently deliberating a legislation to reduce the police force by 50%, which would have one of the lowest officers per capita of any large city if that happens.At the same time, the King County Executive Dow Constantine has pledged to close the Downtown jail and reduce the overall County jail capacity by 60% to 65%. It is just thing after thing after thing that the activists are pushing forward as we struggle with the COVID pandemic, as we struggle with this civil unrest. They're not waiting at all and their goal is very simple, abolish the police, abolish prisons and abolish the courts.INGRAHAM: So, again, the goal is clear. If that's what they want to do, the ends are going to mean complete destruction of life as we know it or knew it, I should say in Seattle. And Christopher, you got your hands on documents from King County's, it's called Zero Youth Detention Program, and they offer a template for Seattle's radical plan to abolish the prisons you just referenced. And that the document is full of ideas from critical race theory, including this page that describes white culture as \"individualism, meritocracy, progress and objectivity.\" Chris, doesn't it sound like it was written by a white supremacist there? Unbelievable.RUFO: Yes, there is a really increasingly fine line between old style racism and new style critical race theory. And what's happened is this, progressives have realized that the economic divide, classical Marxism is not a winning message. It has never worked anywhere it has been tried in the last century. So they've really grasped onto something that is unfortunately working much better for their aims, it's dividing people along racial lines and using the rhetoric of race to achieve the economic outcomes of Marxism.And Seattle is really ground zero and it's really astonishing, if you look at these documents, they're basically making the argument that the entire justice system is an institution of white supremacy, an institution of white domination, and the corrupt and evil racist culture, and the only solution for them, and this is at the highest levels of government, is to burn it all down. And that's what we're seeing not only in the streets, but we're seeing that in the boardrooms, in the decision-making centers, at the highest levels of government. It's really astonishing. And we haven't seen anything like this in recent history.INGRAHAM: Yes. I can tell you, Christopher, flyover country, those Midwestern states, swing states across this country - they better see that the coasts are collapsing in on them. If they think it's going to stay in Seattle, they haven't been paying attention. It's going to get worse under Biden because they're going to know what they're doing is working. Christopher, stay on this for us please and thank you for bringing us this story.Now, we traveled 2000 miles east of Seattle to Chicago, where Mayor Lori Lightfoot's exceedingly bad leadership is exacerbating the horrific crime wave there now sweeping the city in the wake of George Floyd's death. But the failure isn't Lightfoot's alone; it also rests with Cook County State Attorney Kim Foxx. Now, that's right; that's a woman who refused to hold Jussie Smollett accountable for his hate crime hoax.She is now letting peaceful protesters who destroy and loot businesses off the hook. Why is she doing this? What's really her goal? Critics say she's refusing to uphold the rule of law because she wants a future in this new far left Democrat politics. Now, one of those critics and my next guest, Judge Pat O'Brien wants to derail her dangerous political ambitions. He joins me now and he's challenging her, Kim Foxx, for State's Attorney. Judge O'Brien, why is it so important in your mind that she be defeated in the next election?PATRICK O'BRIEN, R-STATE ATTORNEY CANDIDATE, COOK COUNTY: Laura, good evening and thank you. It's important because at this point, we're at a tipping stage where her policies are both corrupted and ineffective, and it seems like she's encouraging what we see on the streets, which is the blood of the innocent children that's running down and essentially the gangs and drugs controlling neighbourhoods; neighborhoods that she says she's protecting. So, the only thing we can do is to say \"Enough is enough, fire Kim Foxx\".INGRAHAM: Now, this is what Chicago police union president said on this show just a week ago.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOHN CATANZARA, PRESIDENT, CHICAGO FRATERNAL ORDER OF POLICE: There is a lot of people that were arrested with those guns that were immediately let back out on the street again. And it goes right back to Kim Foxx and the broken county jail system.I'm appealing directly to every voter in Cook County, Illinois, right now. You have a chance this November to take Kim Foxx out of office and do something worthwhile. She needs to go if we are going to get the city back away from the iceberg that the mayor has said it on a course with.(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM: Judge O'Brien what's your message to the voters of Chicago this fall, especially those who are worried about the rule of law, race relations, all of it?O'BRIEN: Well, it's this, that you can't have turnstile justice, that you can't tell people that they can violate the law with impunity. They've got to be told that there are consequences for what, in fact, they do. There was no way that the neighborhoods are going to be safe, that victims are going to be protected if you turn your back on the law. The fact that she's running for an office that she doesn't have right now, which is to be on national stage, is just a crime, and the crime is Kim Foxx.INGRAHAM: Judge O'Brien, thank you so much, good to see you tonight.And up ahead, why is big pharma taking on Trump? Senator Josh Hawley takes them all on, and you don't want to miss it.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)INGRAHAM: Last week President Trump signed four very aggressive executive orders to slash drug prices, and as expected, big pharma, they are fighting back. Here is what the CEO of Pfizer said on an earnings call today.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm disappointed by these executive orders. They pose enormous destruction at a time where the industry needs to be completely focused on developing a potential COVID-19 vaccine or treatment. We have plans to invest in both, R&D and manufacturing in the United States. If finalized, these new executive orders would force us to rescind those plans.(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM: Well, Pfizer, of course, everyone knows is an amazing American company, but his grousing about profits is absurd. Last week HHS and the Pentagon announced that it would pay Pfizer and its German biotech partner $1.95 billion to produce 100 million doses of a COVID-19 vaccine with the option of buying an additional 500 million doses, so you do the math they are. So there is no reason U.S. citizens should be paying more than other OECD countries for other drugs that Pfizer makes. That's the whole point of this executive order. The upcharge is absurd.Here to respond is Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri. Senator, you just heard the CEO of Pfizer essentially threatening to move manufacturing overseas because of these executive orders. What does this tell you?SEN. JOSH HAWLEY, R-MO.: It tells you that they are very interested in their profits and the gravy train that they've had going for years. Listen, I have no sympathy for big pharma whatsoever. They routinely charge Americans two and three and four times more for the same drugs that they charge patients in, say, Europe, France. And I know this is true because we have studies them. My home state of Missouri, they are charging people of Missouri three and four and five times more than they're charging folks in France or Germany and Canada. And I'm glad that the president is standing up to them.INGRAHAM: And I think, again, the money that is given by the drug companies to both political parties, it's astronomical. They are among the biggest donors to politics in the United States. And that's fine. That's what they do. But let's not all think this is all just charitable endeavors. It's a business, it's a company, but they have gotten a free ride.And I wanted to ask you, senator, about the president's decision, the administration's decision to give Kodak a boost in order to keep some medical manufacturing in the United States. There are a lot of conservatives out there, free marketeers, who would say we are playing favorites. And to that you say?HAWLEY: Well, I say, listen, it is important we manufacture as many pharmaceutical products as we can in this country. The fact that we manufacture so few drugs any longer, particularly drugs like insulin, we manufactured zero percent in this country. Major pharmaceutical products we've found because of the COVID-19 crisis that we are deeply dependent on foreign supply chains. So I think it is incumbent to look at all the options for bringing those supply chains back, for getting medical production back in this country.And to go back to big pharma, again, I don't have any sympathies for these guys. This big pharma, big government alliance has been great for big pharma. They have made a killing these last few years, really for decades. And it's time they start putting patients first.INGRAHAM: And Senator, a couple of weeks back, speaking of Biden, he said we should re-examine Trump's tariffs on China. Of course, that's the whole reason China came to the bargaining table in these trade deals. But today, Biden came out and pretended that he was going to be the one after four decades plus in Washington to put America first. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOE BIDEN, D-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Using federal dollars that have already been appropriated, to focus them on building things that make us and increase our independence, so we don't have to rely on anyone else for, whether it's cyber security, cyber information. We have the capacity to do it at home. Do them at home.(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM: OK, Senator, is it my mistake or not, am I remembering this incorrectly -- wasn't he vice president in an administration for eight years? I must have missed all that work on these issues of bringing manufacturing back to the United States.HAWLEY: The problem with Joe Biden is that he is a classic China appeaser, and he has been his whole political career. He certainly was as vice president. Heck, even earlier this year he was questioning whether China was really a geostrategic threat. That turned out to be a little bit of a problem for him as we have seen with COVID-19, which is why he doesn't want to talk about those past statements now.But this is a guy who has never stood up to China. In fact, he has been all too eager to roll out the red carpet for China, give them whatever they want, sell out our jobs, sell out our workers. That's the problem. We're still cleaning up from his mess of years ago.And why would we go back to those failed policies? We don't need more appeasement. We need to get tough on China. This president started to do it. We need even more of that.INGRAHAM: Senator, I wouldn't let you get away without like you said this past weekend where you said, quite candidly, that you wouldn't support a Supreme Court nominee unless he or she had publicly stated before the nomination that Roe versus Wade was wrongly decided. Now, is that a litmus test that even some Republicans will back away from? What is your response?HAWLEY: You can call it whatever you want, Laura. I call it asking some basic questions about judicial philosophy. And I also call it the end of the trust us approach. For years conservatives, especially religious conservatives, let's be honest, have been told by the D.C. establishment just trust us. We'll pick good judges, just trust us. Don't ask too many questions, certainly don't ask about Roe. Just trust us.I'm through with that. I want to know, because Roe is absolutely central, Roe is an unbridled act of judicial imperialism. And if a nominee thinks that Roe was rightly decided, then he or she is a judicial imperialist and I'm not going to vote for him.INGRAHAM: We've still go to get Collins and Murkowski to sign on to any potential Supreme Court pick, but I would agree with you that if look at Roberts' record and even Gorsuch on some issues, and you wonder what the heck happened there. Trust but verify, I guess that's what you have to do. Senator, great to see you as always on these important issues. Thanks so much.And Twitter and Facebook are censoring anyone now who dares tout potential benefits of hydroxychloroquine. Now, my question is, does big tech have an M.D. after their vaunted brand names? And are they costing lives? Two doctors who have actually treated COVID patients with hydroxy including the one who organized yesterday's now viral press conference, they're here to respond. You don't want to miss this.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I have personally treated over 350 patients with COVID. And the result has been the same. I put them on hydroxychloroquine, I put them zinc, I put them on ZithroMax, and they are all well. I've not lost one patient.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: If it seems like there is an orchestrated attack that's going on against hydroxychloroquine, it's because there is. When have you ever heard of a medication generating this degree of controversy?(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM: But the M.D.'s at Twitter and Facebook have deemed those comments, heretical, dangerous. Twitter said the video violates its policies on spreading misleading and potentially harmful information related to COVID-19, misinformation? Here's what one of the world's top epidemiologist told this show about hydroxychloroquine just last week.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)INGRAHAM: You think thousands of lives could be saved going forward if they released that hydroxychloroquine stockpile and even gave it as a prophylactic for frontline workers, if they wanted it?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I think 75,000 to 100,000 lives will be saved if that happens.(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM: Joining me now is Dr. Ramin Oskouithe cardiologist, CEO of Foxhall Cardiology in D.C. Also with me, Dr. Simone Gold, emergency medicine specialist. Dr. Gold, let's start with you. You organized this now viral event yesterday. What's your reaction to the anti-hydroxychloroquine censorship by big tech?DR. SIMONE GOLD, EMERGENCY MEDICINE SPECIALIST: We come with a message of hope for the American people. The American people have been told that this is just something they need to have a lot of fear and a lot of panic over. And it's simply not true. There's a cure, there's treatment for early COVID disease, and that is hydroxychloroquine and zinc. It's very straightforward. It's easy. When you look at data from other countries, it's easy. We just don't have that kind of access here.And if anybody has any doubt that this is the answer, all they have to do is notice that YouTube, Twitter, and Facebook deleted all information about this. When did do a press conference, but we also had six hours of education from physicians explaining exactly why the drug works and going over all the safety and efficacy. They even took down our website. It's incredible. So somebody is really afraid of getting the truth.But I'm here to tell the American people hydroxychloroquine and zinc, we're going to get the information back up soon, America's frontline doctors.INGRAHAM: Dr. Oskoui, here is the latest hydroxychloroquine hating from Dr. Fauci himself. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS, ABC NEWS: The president promoting the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine. We know the FDA has recommended against emergency use.DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES: Exactly. And I go along with the FDA. The overwhelmingly, prevailing clinical trials that have looked at the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine have indicated that it is not effective in coronavirus disease.(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM: Dr. Oskoui, what are the issues with the studies? There's one from Brazil that seem to be coloring Fauci and others' thinking on hydroxy, also the Boulware study. What is he talking about?DR. RAMIN OSKOUI, CARDIOLOGIST: What he is talking about is probably the most recent study out of Brazil that was referenced that came out last year in the New England Journal of Medicine. What it showed was when hydroxychloroquine given late, they couldn't tell whether it worked or not. And that's the study authors' own words. The reality is when given early in mild to moderate disease, hydroxychloroquine works terrifically well, and as we've seen, cuts mortality rate by 50 percent.INGRAHAM: But when we see the comments from mainstream media sources, Dr. Gold, I'm not going to say the word \"cure.\" I'm not a doctor, but I am going to say the passionate fight against a drug that's been around for 60 years is stunning. And the vitriol with which the critics launch their attacks, I've never seen anything like it. I don't know if Trump had never talked about it, if they'd feel differently, or if it's big pharma, or a combination, I don't know. But Dr. Gold, your group became persona non grata really quickly, really quickly.GOLD: You know what, Laura, I am a board certified practicing emergency physician. That's fine. We can take it. All of us can take it. But what we need to do, is we requested the FDA look at the emergency use authorization that's on their desk. We'd really like them just to allow us to use hydroxychloroquine, as we always were able to prior to COVID, and especially let us use it on-label now for COVID so that the states can stop restricting our usage of it. We really just want to heal patients and heal America.INGRAHAM: Dr. Oskoui, a former Planned Parenthood president actually chimed in on hydroxy. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DR. LEANA WEN, FORMER PRESIDENT AND PLANNED PARENTHOOD: I really worry, Wolf, because there are so many millions of Americans for whom the president is their most trusted messenger. And when he starts saying things that go against science that are actually dangerous, I worry that Americans are going to go out, as they have before, and take this unproven medication.(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM: When I think of protecting lives, Dr. Oskoui, I think of Planned Parenthood. What's really frightening this woman?OSKOUI: I think what's frightening this woman is that there are numerous clinical trials that show that hydroxychloroquine works. And I think what she is afraid of is that this gets discovered by the American people. We never talk about the European data. We never talk about the mortality rates in countries that went to hydroxychloroquine early and aggressively. And that's something that should scare all of these people. Dr. Fauci is simply lying.INGRAHAM: Put that chart up. We actually have a chart. Put that chart up. We only have a few seconds. I wanted people to see that chart, where you see the countries on the right, early HCQ use, that's hydroxy use, very low rates of mortality and hospitalizations. Doctors, thank you very much.Up next, the Last Bite. It's a good one. Stay there.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)INGRAHAM: OK, if you want proof that Stacey Abrams is no longer a top V.P. contender, listen to this one.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)STACEY ABRAMS, FORMER GEORGIA GUBERNATORIAL CANDIDATE: We can't romanticize and say that if we do this, the world changes. It doesn't. There are no saviors running for reelection. There are no saviors running to save our country.Well, I want us to remember that this election is not about being excited about any single person. It's about being energized about our power to shape our future.(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM: Biden better hope his voters have more enthusiasm for his run than she has. That's all the time we have tonight.

We will discuss the chaos in America's liberal cities, law and order, safety, security, the coronavirus, the economy and, of course, Joe Biden.And, of course, the president is also -- well, his opponent actually steps foot outside of the house today, the basement. And that's the second time in two weeks. That's a record. Way to go, Joe.And the corrupt, ever confused, ever frail Joe Biden actually left his home. He traveled all the way from Delaware to Pennsylvania where his trusty teleprompter where he delivered -- well, a painfully awkward speech in a large, mostly empty room filled with lots and lots of birds. It's getting bizarre.Take a look.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOE BIDEN, D-PRESUMPTIVE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: I had an uncle who said, Joey, your labor from belt buckle to shoe sole. Well, I've taken pride in that.In the weeks ahead, I'll be laying out a plan to mobilize American talent and heart to build a 21st century care-giving and education workforce.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: All right. Following those awe-inspiring remarks, Biden took zero questions from the media, no surprise there. Joe was having a hard time reading the teleprompter, much less answer unscripted questions. In fact, a short time later during the trip to Biden's childhood home, Biden also refused to answer questions again as he sort of stared off into space.Let's take a look.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BIDEN: Hey, buddy, how are you?REPORTER: Hey, Mr. Vice President. Time for a few questions?BIDEN: No, no. I just (INAUDIBLE)(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: Now, our very own Peter Doocy, he asked the question but as you can see, the other reporters there, more than happy to just see Joe take a backseat in order to shield and protect Joe Biden.Remember, the mob and the media, they will be the number one contributor to the Biden campaign. That's 99 percent of the media mob. Now, that includes the New York toilet paper \"Times\", even encouraging Joe not to show up for the debates unless these rigid conditions are met.So if you really want to know how -- well, Biden will govern if elected, look no further than the policy recommendations he just released. Now, we have them all. Numerous sections of the 110 page document, there actually plagiarized word for word from Bernie Sanders campaign.By the way, plagiarism, nothing new for Joe Biden. In the 1980s, he was forced to end his presidential campaign. He was caught red-handed plagiarizing a British politician by the name of Neil Kinnock word for word on multiple occasions. We even have the videotape proof.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)NEIL KINNOCK, BRITISH POLITICIAN: Why am I the first Kinnock in a thousand generations to be able to get to university? Was is Glenys the first woman in her family in a thousand generations to be able to get to university?BIDEN: I was thinking as I was coming over here, why is it that Joe Biden is the first in his family ever to go to university? Why is it that my wife is sitting out there in the audience, the first and her family to ever go to college?KINNOCK: Was it because all of our predecessors were thick? Did they lack talent -- those people who could sing and play and recite and write poetry?BIDEN: Is it because our fathers and mothers were not bright? It's because I am the first Biden in a thousand generations to get a college and a graduate degree that I was smarter than the rest? Those same people who read poetry and wrote poetry and taught me how to sing verse.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: I wonder if the mob would bring that up if it was Donald Trump.Biden also plagiarized Robert Kennedy. He was accused of plagiarizing a paper in law school. This guy doesn't even have an original thought in his head.Now, he's literally plagiarizing not only bare Bernie Sanders word for word, but now, he's trying to sound like Donald Trump. We've got to bring manufacturing jobs back to America.Didn't he and Barack say those jobs were never coming back? Let me see. Let me go to the videotape.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BARACK OBAMA, FORMER PRESIDENT: What we have to do is to make sure that folks are trained for the jobs that are coming in now, because some of those jobs of the past are just not going to come back.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: They are not coming back! Joe now changed his position. He wants to sound like Trump. Why not plagiarize him?And the scary part about all of this is Joe is now being controlled by the hard, radical, socialist extreme wing of that liberal party, which is kind of the whole party. In fact, Biden working hand-in-hand with the Sanders campaign on his brand-new policy recommendations. Among these insane new proposals -- let's see -- confiscation of wealth, redistribution of your money for something called environmental justice. In other words, what, the $94 trillion new Green Deal? Even appointing Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez to lead the effort. Biden also pushing for free paid family leave, free paid medical leave, free housing, broad student loan forgiveness, universal health care?Joe also wants to halt all deportations, grant amnesty to 11,000-plus million illegal immigrants, that didn't respect the law and sovereignty of orders? That's right, he would turn the entire country of the united sanctuary states of America, and he even prevent ICE from, well, following the law and deporting criminals they get out of jail.And that's not all. Biden wants to outlaw the right to work, which would force millions of workers to join unions whether they want to or not. And what about pro-choice? Let's not forget, by the way, Biden also wants to eliminate cash bail, which has been nothing but an unmitigated disaster New York.Bernie Sanders is so pleased with this radical socialist lawless agenda he went on -- well, MSDNC, the conspiracy channel, Roswell Rachel Maddow's channel, last night to congratulate Biden on becoming the most progressive candidate in modern history. Way to go, Joe. Listen to this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. BERNIE SANDERS, I-VT.: These folks, needless to say, people who represented the progressive wing, they're going to have perspective on things than did Biden's people. But there was serious discussion and I think a real honest effort to come up with a compromise, and I think the compromise that they came up with, if implemented, will make Biden the most progressive president since FDR.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: If implemented, America would be unrecognizable. It would be a socialist hell hole. It would be another socialist failure. We'd lose freedom and we would lose wealth creation and America's stature in the world, it would be the most precipitous decline in the history of mankind. Now we know what Biden meant when he wanted to transform America into Bernie's America.During the primary, most Democrats try to appease their radical base but then they moved towards the center in what's called the general election. Biden is different, he went hard left, stayed there, and is doubling down on even harder left and even more extreme policy. This isn't about bringing manufacturing jobs back or increasing wages. This is about full-blown extremism, socialism, redistribution and the end of capitalism.And keep in mind, the 78-year-old Biden has been in elected office since the '70s. He served eight years as vice president. He gets zero tough questions from the mob and the media, why didn't he have any success in those eight years?Under President Trump, what have we witnessed? A boom in American manufacturing, the jobs they said weren't coming back. Now, it was Trump. It wasn't Barack. It wasn't Joe who brought those jobs back.Just like it was Trump who ushered in record after record after record after record low unemployment for African-Americans, Hispanic-Americans, and every demographic group we can think of.It was Trump who passed criminal justice reform and police reform. It wasn't Joe and it wasn't Barack.It was President Trump that created opportunities zones, that wasn't Joe, and that wasn't Barack. In five decades in the swamp, what the hell did Joe Biden do?Well, we know that for years, Biden palled around with segregationists. He spent a lot of time with one of his favorite colleagues, his mentor, Robert, the former Klansman, Byrd.And, by the way, he coauthored that crime bill that led to mass incarceration of inner-city youth. He's the one that said there would be predators on our streets. He worried that his kids would grow up in, quote, a racial jungle. But now, in order to please his far-left handlers, Biden is now trashing law enforcement.Just this week, what did he do? Referencing, now the police are viewed as the enemy and said he was totally on board with stripping their federal funding, his own words. Take a listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BIDEN: Surplus military equipment for law enforcement, they don't need that. The last thing you need is an up armored Humvee coming into a neighborhood just like the military invading. They don't know anybody, they become the enemy. They're supposed to be protecting these people. So, my generic point is --HOST: But do we agree that we can redirect some of the funding?BIDEN: Yes, absolutely. One of the things we also need to be doing is fundamentally changing the way, and I've been pushing it for years, changing the way we deal with our prison system.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: What? Militarized police.Hey, Joe, look at these images. They got that equipment when you were vice president. Don't you remember, Ferguson, Baltimore, Cambridge?But now, as you can see, vilifying law enforcement, eliminating law and order and safety and security, that's Joe Biden's top agenda. That's the radical Democratic socialist party's top agenda.Today, Nancy Pelosi, she indicated she has no problem at all with anarchy and angry mobs and anarchists ripping down statue after statue. Here's what she said.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REPORTER: Should not be done by a commission or city council, not a mob in the middle of the night throwing it into the harbor?REP. NANCY PELOSI, D-CALIF.: People do what they do. I do think that from a safety standpoint, it would be a good idea to have it taken down if the community doesn't want it. I don't know that it has to be a commission.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: Mobs will do what they're going to do, people will do what they're going to do. That's the kind of leadership you want post-2020 because that's what you will get with Biden, Pelosi, and Schumer, 125 combined swamp years of failure.You'll get chaos. You'll get anarchy. You will get lawlessness. You'll get broken promises.Your taxes, oh, they're going to go through the roof. He will have open borders, you'll have appeasement abroad and, by the way, the greatest economy on earth, we're now the number one producer of energy in the world, we will no longer have oil or gas. Great idea? No, I don't think so.Get this, police in St. Petersburg, Florida, announcing that soon they will no longer respond to nonemergency calls. Instead, they will be sending social workers.And today, Comrade de Blasio announced that he's banning all large gatherings unless it's an antipolice protest. A lot of rocks, and bricks, bottles and Molotov cocktails thrown in New York cops and a couple precincts burnt down in New York City and a billion dollars taken away from the police.Take a look.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)WOLF BLITZER, CNN ANCHOR: What about protests, people want to watch on fifth avenue quest market they going to be allowed to do so?MAYOR BILL DE BLASIO, D-NEW YORK CITY: Look, Wolf, this is always an area of real sensitivity. If we were just talking about health, we would always say, hey, folks, you know, stay home if you can. But we understand at this moment in history, people are talking about the need for historic changes. I mean, today, in New York City, you know, recognizing the power and the meaning of the message black lives matter, which we did in front of Trump Tower today.This is a historic moment of change. We have to respect that but also say to people the kinds of gatherings we are used to, the parades, the fairs, we just can't have that while we're focusing on health right now.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: Only no social distancing of the protest.A hundred seventeen days, this decision will be yours. You are the ultimate -- you are the ultimate verdict. You surrender that verdict in 117 days.You want left-wing lawlessness. You want law and order. You want open borders, security, safety, or not? You want amnesty for illegal immigrants? Yes or no?You want higher taxes are lower taxes? Do you want more regulations or less regulations? You want activist justices or constitutional originalists on the court? Do you want to line the pockets of Hunter Biden or keep making tough and fair trade deals around the world?Let's see, do you want another nuclear Iran peace deal with $150 billion in cash and currency, or peace through strength? Do you want to be forced into government run health care, or you want to keep your private health insurance?Come November, all of it is on the line. No pressure. And so much more. Capitalism, liberty, security, safety, security, Constitution, our very way of life hangs in the balance.The president will join us in just moments. First, joining us, I call him the great one, Mark Levin.Great one, a lot is going to happen in 117 days, Mark, and if the policies that he's plagiarizing now from Joe and Ocasio-Cortez, if they're implemented, I say that the America we know, free-market capitalism, the greatest wealth producer in the history of mankind, that will go away, and the country will be in poverty and unrecognizable.MARK LEVIN, \"UNFREEDOM OF THE PRESS\" AUTHOR: Joe Biden sounds like such a great candidate, doesn't he? I think I'll support him for president, but not of this country. Maybe Venezuela.You have the Bernie Bolsheviks now who are backing Biden. Bernie Sanders is basically running the Democrat Party. This is the Bernie Sanders agenda. Joe Biden is an empty suit. He surrounded himself with every radical kook you can imagine like AOC and others.This is a Democrat Party that is as evil as it's ever been. It's a growing anti-Semitic movement within the Democrat Party. It's a growing anti- American movement at its core.Joe Biden has been around for half a century. He's been in Washington, D.C., for half a century.So for him to talk about, we're going to make fundamental economic changes, were going to make changes and make America more equal, he spent a good portion of his career in the Senate as a bigot and I mean this in all seriousness, if you look at his background and the things that he used to say.Joe Biden was a nasty, mean man. He destroyed Bob Bork, or tried to, talk to his family. He tried to extort Clarence Thomas, talk to his family. This isn't some lunch bucket Joe, this guy is a fraud.Meanwhile, he's got a Senate records. They're all hiding in the University of Delaware. They want to talk about Trump taxes.If you don't mind, I want to hit the United States Supreme Court briefly here. It's a very, very important.We have two justices on the Supreme Court and seven politicians, that's what we have. The Roberts court is a disaster, it's rudderless. You've got the four horses of liberalism there who vote together on the big issues every time and they hope to flip Roberts or Kavanaugh and Gorsuch, and they've been doing a hell of a good job of it.I want the American people to know today that five lawyers in robes picked up from obscurity today ruled that half of Oklahoma doesn't belong to Oklahoma anymore. It belongs to an Indian tribe. You have a couple more million American citizens now apart from Native Americans who lived in that part of the state and they have no idea what their fate is.This is a court that is tyrannical. This is a court that has done more damage to the rule of law and the Constitution than to the Bernie Sanders- Biden rioters over the last two months on a number of cases.And let's talk about the president's tax returns. What the hell is it about his tax returns that they're obsessed with? Is there something wrong with his tax returns? No.What's going on? His tax returns are probably like this and then you take the attachments that are probably like this, and we know what the media and the Democrats will do, oh, he took a deduction for this, he shouldn't have taken a deduction for this. These are evil people.That's why I think the president doesn't want to give us tax returns. And the Supreme Court just issued a decision that allows every Podunk prosecutor to come up with a pretext and to get a president's tax returns or financial information, what the hell is that all about? They're destroying the executive branch.Then, we have Congress. They have subpoenas. We need to know about the finances of the president. They didn't want to know about the finances about Obama or Clinton or Biden when he was vice president. No, this president.You want to know why? Because this is one of the first presidents we've ever had who actually earned money before he became president of the United States. All the rest of them, the Obamas, Biden, Gore, they become multimillionaires selling their prior offices. This man gives up his salary to charity and so forth.Legislative oversight, Congress has legislative oversight. They don't invest a president's finances. They don't issue tons of subpoenas.The Supreme Court did grave damage to the Constitution today and they're supposed to uphold the Constitution. The tax issue, the supremacy clause. Sam Alito is 100 percent right. That is -- a prosecutor for a county doesn't have the power to get the president's tax returns. He can't indict a president.So, what the hell does he want him for? Do you what the pretext he used this, Sean?HANNITY: Mark --LEVIN: Hush money! Since when is a nondisclosure agreement hush money.HANNITY: Mark --LEVIN: Corporations enter into nondisclosure agreements, politicians enter into nondisclosure agreements. I'd like to know how many nondisclosure agreements there are in the Cyrus Vance district attorney's office, in the Southern District of New York office, members of Congress.That's not hush money. That's not a campaign violation.The Southern District of New York dropped out a long time ago. So the Supreme Court goes along with this? And these endless subpoenas from Congress, the Democrats, they've impeached the president once, an unconstitutional impeachment. They're threatening to impeach the attorney general of the United States. They have cavorted (ph) with lawlessness in the Obama administration that attempted a coup.You know, the president of the United States, you know, he must wonder if they're all out to get him. They are all out to get him.And let me tell you one other thing, you talk about how important this election is and Joe Biden and what he stands for, I don't give a damn about Joe Biden what he stands for. He sucked this country dry, he's made himself rich. He's been in public office for his entire life.I care about the American people. This election is between the American people who love this country, who believe in 1776, who believe that the Founders, who believe in Jefferson, Washington, Benjamin Franklin, John Adams and all the rest, and those who do not.Joe Biden hasn't defended the cops in this country once. He hasn't denounced the rioters other than one barely coherent sentence other than once.Nancy Pelosi has never condemned the rioters! Chuck Schumer has never condemned the rioters! You want to know why? They're Democrats! They're Bernie Sanders supporters.So, the people who love this country, I don't give a damn what party you are, or if you have no party, if you're working hard, if you're trying to work hard, if you want the government -- the economy open, if you want your kids to go back to school, if you want to have some normalcy back, you've got to vote for Trump!I know what the narrative is, Trump won't unite us. How was he supposed to unite us with rioters? How has he supposed to unite us with Nancy Pelosi and Joe Biden and that party?The Democrat Party has a history of anti-Americanism, whether it's slavery, segregation, Jim Crow, it has a history of anti-Americanism, and that includes today. It's just a differentism.It was a Confederacy then. Now they are dancing with the Marxists, whether it's Black Lives Matter or Antifa, whether it's -- whether it's the mayor of New York, de cameo, and now, they've embraced Bernie Sanders, the most radical man -- or woman -- but the most radical person in Congress today. That is now the Biden agenda.If you're a union person and a Democrat --HANNITY: Hey, Mark --LEVIN: -- if you're a nonunion person and a Democrat, you better wake up to what's going on. These are not old-style Democrats anymore. These are crazy bastards.Yes, Sean?HANNITY: OK, well, that's a good way to end it.I will say this, you know, if Donald Trump said the things that Pelosi, Schumer praising, you know, the former Klansman, or Biden's positions, his comments about a racial jungle, or predators, or his positions on integration, busing, segregation, praising segregationists, these are modern Democrats that Schumer, Pelosi, Biden, Hillary, and Bill.Great One, I've got to let you go. Thank you for being with us, sir.Joining us now on the phone is President Donald Trump from the White House tonight.Mr. President, thank you, sir, for being with us.PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, thank you very much.And how good is Mark?HANNITY: Mark is on fire tonight. There's no doubt about it.TRUMP: He's on fire.HANNITY: That's why I call him the great one.I want to start. We have an election in 117 days, Mr. President. And your campaign came out with an ad. The issue of law and order and safety and security are now key in this country.We will go over Joe Biden's comments.But your campaign released this ad. It's -- I'm of the view that nobody pursues happiness if you're not safe and secure.Let's roll with -- let's roll tape.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)NARRATOR: You have reached the 911 police emergency line.Due to defunding of the police department, we are sorry, but no one is here to take your call. If you're calling to report a rape, please press one. To report a murder, press two. To report a home invasion, press three.For all other crimes, leave your name and number, and someone will get back to you. Our estimated wait time is currently five days.Goodbye.TRUMP: I'm Donald J. Trump, and I approve this message.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: Mr. President, I'm going to read the comments of Joe Biden, if I may.He said: \"Surplus military equipment for law enforcement\" -- by the way, they used it in Ferguson and Baltimore -- \"they don't need that. The last thing you need is an up-armored Humvee coming into a neighborhood.\"I haven't noticed that.\"It's like a military invading. They don't know anybody. They have become the enemy. They're supposed to be protecting the people.\"Then asked about funding: \"Do you agree we can redirect the funding?\"\"Absolutely.\"OK.Mr. President, I would argue that no American could be happy if they are not safe and secure or pursue happiness without safety and security.TRUMP: Well, I agree with that 100 percent.And we need safety. We need security. We can't defund our police. And we can't abolish our police. They want to abolish our police.And as far as the surplus equipment, I have given out hundreds of millions of dollars. This is stuff that was sitting in storage houses all over the country. It wasn't even old, but it was never going to be used again. It was gathering dust. And I gave it out to all of our police forces all over the country, saved many, many police lives and many lives, I think, period.It was really -- a lot of it was protective equipment. And I know that President Obama and Biden didn't want to give it out. They thought it was terrible to give it out. It made the police look too strong. And I gave it out, and I have been thanked by every police department.HANNITY: Mr. President, while the summer of love zone turned into a shooting zone -- and I'm going to run some videotape.One is a man shot while walking his 6-year-old little girl in the Bronx in New York, assassinated in broad daylight. Another, a gunman opened fired in a Bronx apartment building.Then I will show the -- on this very show live our own Steve Harrigan interviewing protesters that took over a city block in Atlanta. That resulted in the death of an 8-year-old girl two weeks later.You see what's happening, shootings up. Violent crime is up. Murder is up, 130 percent shootings up in New York City. You see the statistics in Chicago every weekend.How do you react to that?TRUMP: Well, first of all, New York City is not recognizable. Crime is way up. Shootings are way up. Murder is way up. It's just unbelievable.Chicago -- what's going in Chicago -- and we're looking at it very seriously, because we're going to have to do something.We have asked them. We're really supposed to be asked to come in and help the federal government. And we have the greatest people in the world, and we can solve it. But we are supposed to be asked. So, the mayor or the governor of Illinois should be asking. But they don't want to ask.And you look every weekend and every week in Chicago, it's just numbers that are not believable. Atlanta is starting to have some problems.So, we are ready to act. And, at some point, we may have to act anyway. We may have to do it sooner, rather than later.HANNITY: Let's talk about the issue of acting.I had a source that told me -- I was not able to confirm it -- that one of the reasons that the Seattle mayor finally acted is that they were given notice that, if they didn't act, that you were going to.Is there any truth to that?TRUMP: A hundred percent. We were going in. We were going in very soon. We let them know that.And they, all of a sudden -- they didn't want that, so they went in before we got there. And -- but we were going and very shortly, very soon, and we would've taken the CHOP, I call it, CHOP. We would have taken it back very easily.But they went in. And, frankly, the people just gave up. They were tired. They had it for a long period of time.But because of the fact that we were going to go in -- now, if you look at Minneapolis, after four or five days of horror, we called them. We said, you got to get out the National Guard. We insisted that they do it.When the National Guard finally got out, they walked through it like a knife goes through butter. That was the end of their problem. That was it. It was a great job done by the National Guard.And, yes, we were all set to go into Seattle. Frankly, I looked forward to it.HANNITY: Mr. President, Joe Biden was vice president for eight years, Barack Obama's hometown is Chicago.Every weekend, we get these statistics. Lawrence Jones, who is our 2020 reporter on this program, actually interviewed the father. He lost a 7- year-old little girl. I don't know how you recover from something like that.And -- but this -- Biden and Barack Obama, President Obama, Vice President Biden, they barely ever talked about the violence in Barack Obama's hometown.What specifically can you do? I know you have offered to help New York City. I know you have offered to help Chicago. I know you offered to help Seattle. I know you did help Minneapolis and you did help D.C.But when they keep refusing your help, what are your options?TRUMP: So, first of all, I saw the interview.And he's a lovely man. I spoke to him at length, and with his friend, who is a great guy too.HANNITY: Horace Lorenzo Anderson, yes, sir, his son killed.TRUMP: I actually invited them down to the White House at some point, when they get -- when they get -- when they get adjusted, because it is so tough.I mean, what he is going through is so tough. And he was treated very badly. They didn't even tell him what had happened, when it had happened. Very sad thing.But I did speak to him. And I had a great, but very sad conversation. And so, he will be coming down. When he's ready, he will be coming down to the White House.I will say, look, they have to be tough. They have to be smart. What's going on there -- and, you know, the Chicago police is terrific. The New York police, New York's finest, they are just not being allowed to do their job. They don't want to do anything, because they will end up -- they will end up with lots of bad things happening to them. They are not letting them do the job.And I dealt a lot with Mayor de Blasio. I was very nice to Mayor de Blasio. I got him ventilators when he needed them. I got him hospital help when he needed it. I got him everything he needed. I got him the gowns. I got him the masks. I got him everything, the shields. I got that man everything. I spoke to him many times.He couldn't have been nicer. And then he throws a big Black Lives Matter sign right down in the middle of Fifth Avenue. And all merchants along Fifth Avenue are furious. They are furious. And the whole city is furious.The city is a city that's enraged. And...HANNITY: Well, but I'll tell you, but nobody...(CROSSTALK)HANNITY: I mean...TRUMP: Everything I did -- and I'm -- it's almost -- it was almost a test, Sean.But I was so good to him and to Governor Cuomo, like nobody has ever been good. And all you end up doing out of that place is get prosecuted and have a lot of trouble.So, New York is not the place that it was. Everyone's leaving. They're moving to Florida. They're moving to other places. It's very sad, actually, to see what happened.HANNITY: Yes.To be honest, I'm the only idiot who stays here. I need to get my contract changed, so I can get the hell out of here myself, to be honest.You know, in 1984, the question came up, especially after the first debate President Reagan had at the time with Walter Mondale, the age question.TRUMP: Right.HANNITY: Let me play a montage of, well, let's say, not some of the finest moments of Joe Biden.And I want your reaction. And the question will be, does he have the mental alertness, does he have the strength and stamina, what I believe is the hardest job in the world? It's not what I do. Being president, I argue -- I would argue, is a hell of a lot harder.But here's Joe Biden.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)(PHONE RINGING)JOE BIDEN, D-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: The scale -- the scale of the loss is staggering.I don't know whose phone that is, but the scale of the loss is staggering. It's been two months since Congress gave them that money.You introduce me?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: OK.BIDEN: Am I on?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes, sir.BIDEN: Good evening. Thanks so much for tuning inLook, tomorrow's super star Tuesday. And I want to thank you all. I tell you what. I'm rushing ahead, aren't I?We hold these truths to be self-evident. All men and women are created by the -- go -- you know -- you know the thing.My name is Joe Biden. I'm a Democratic candidate for the United States Senate. Look me over. If you like what you see, help out.If you agree with me, go to Joe 30330.We choose truth over facts.Play the radio. Make sure the television -- excuse me -- make sure you have the record player on at night, the phone. Make sure the kids hear words.Poor kids are just as bright and just as talented as white kids.Donald Trump does pose an existential to this -- the -- it's not hypothetical.Why in God's name should someone who is clipping coupons in the stock market make -- in fact, pay a lower tax rate than someone who, in fact, is, like I said, a schoolteacher and a firefighter?(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: I think my favorite -- my personal favorite is, we hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created -- and women are created equal by the thing -- you know, the thing. That would be God, who created everything.But, Mr. President, in your view, does he have the alertness -- trying to be charitable here -- the strength and stamina? You are in the job. I would argue the toughest job in the world. That's my position. And I have held that for many decades.TRUMP: Well, I don't think it's the age, because I was with Bernie Marcus. I think he's 91. He is so sharp. He's as sharp as ever.He's great, the founder of Home Depot, one of the founders, great guy. And I deal with other people in their late 80s, early 90s, and they're 100 percent mentally so sharp. Sheldon Adelson is an example, and others, many others. I could -- and they -- they're mentally 100 percent.But Joe is just -- look, let's face it, he's been taken over by the radical left. He has no clue what they are doing and what they're getting him into.This is worse than Bernie Sanders at his -- at his best. And you look at the deal they made with Bernie Sanders now in the group. It's all crazy, radical left stuff. And Joe is never going to be able to fight it, even if he disagreed with it, which I actually don't think he does.I think they -- you know, there is an expression, an old expression, was used badly in old time ago in politics. I think they brainwashed him. They brainwashed him. He doesn't know where he is. He doesn't know what he's doing.And our country will suffer. Our stock markets will crash. Bad things will happen. They will defund the police. They will abolish the police. It will be maybe a backlash, or maybe it'll just go to hell, like Venezuela.HANNITY: You hear stories now, and Thomas Friedman and The New York Times is wanting to now create all new conditions for Joe Biden to agree to debate you. Now, he apparently says that he has many cognitive tests. He's tested all the time cognitively. Maybe they -- maybe he will release those records, and maybe he will release his medical records. Everybody wants to see -- seemingly see everything about you.Now, would you agree to any new conditions? Or does he have to debate, like it's always happened? And do you think he's trying to back out of debating you?TRUMP: Well, the answer is yes, absolutely.But he -- he meant the COVID tests, the COVID tests. He didn't mean cognitive. He meant COVID.HANNITY: No, he said cognitive. I'm pretty sure he...(CROSSTALK)TRUMP: Well, I know. But he didn't mean that, because you don't have those tests that often. He said, I take them all the time.And, no, he meant to COVID. But I think he was confused by the questions and the words and everything else. He didn't mean that, because he hasn't taken any cognitive test, because he couldn't pass one.I actually took one when I -- very recently, when I -- when I was -- the radical left were saying, is he all there? Is he all there? And I proved I was all there, because I got -- I aced it. I aced the test.And he should take the same exact test, a very standard test. I took it at Walter Reed Medical Center in front of doctors. And they were very surprised. They said, that's an unbelievable thing. Rarely does anybody do what you just did.But he should take that same test.But, no, he has been totally taken over, and I think it's because he doesn't understand what's going on. I watched him today. I watched him over the last couple of weeks. And I look forward to debating him, but it looks like he wants to try to get out of the debates.I think we are doing very well in the polls. I think, if you look at the different states, I think we are doing very well. We are rapidly rising.I was with the president of Mexico yesterday. We had an incredible day. We have tremendous Hispanic support. We have tremendous African American support. I think we have great support, period.You look at the boats, you look at the bikers, you look at everything that's happening in our country, there is great spirit, spirit like nobody's ever seen before, actually. And there's no spirit for Joe.HANNITY: Let me ask you about the recent rise in outbreaks.And we had talked about this all throughout the beginning of coronavirus. And that was that it -- Dr. Oz said it often on both radio and TV with me, that it's not a matter of if, it's a matter of when, that there are going to be hot spots and a reemergence, et cetera.We are now seeing such things happen, this time in the Sunbelt.Florida Governor DeSantis was on. One of the things that he did differently is, he went in and protected the nursing homes and the elderly care facilities. He's doing the same.And I was a little bit surprised at the numbers in Florida in terms of the ages of people now that are contracting the virus, much, much younger. On the one hand, you don't want anyone to contract it.But, on the other hand, we know that the people that are most vulnerable to this virus for severe illness or death are those that are elderly, those with underlying conditions, or those with compromised immune systems. And it does not impact young people anywhere near the way it does older people.What do you make of these hot spots, as we call them, in Florida and Texas and other states, and Dr. Fauci's comments?TRUMP: Well, first of all, the mortality rate -- and Dr. Fauci is a nice man, but he's made a lot of mistakes, like, you don't have to ban them coming in from very infected China. I did it anyway, and we saved hundreds of thousands of lives.I banned Europe from coming in, when Italy and when France and Spain were having all the problems, and we saved hundreds of thousands of lives. A lot of people said, don't do it. They have been wrong about a lot of things, including face masks. Maybe they are wrong, maybe not. But a lot of them said, don't wear a mask, don't wear a mask. And now they are saying, wear a mask.So, a lot of mistakes were made, a lot of mistakes.Let me just make one statement, though. We do testing like nobody's ever done testing. And when we test, the more you test, the more cases you find. Other countries, you know when they test? And I ask them all. They test when somebody's not feeling well or when somebody walks into a hospital. So they don't have tests.They have tests that are very, very limited. We have these massive -- 40, 45 million people have been tested. It's a record. And our tests are the best.So, we have cases all over the place. Most of those cases immediately get better. They get -- people -- they're young people. They have sniffles, and two days later, they are fine. And they are not sick to start off with. They are asymptomatic.A lot of things happen. And what we are doing is, with all of these tests that we are doing all over the country, test everybody, test, pull-up parking lots, everything else, what we have done is, we have created a tremendous number of cases.Everybody else -- can you imagine if China tested like we test? They don't. Can you imagine if other big countries, the bigger countries, tested like we -- or Germany. We have tested many, many, many times, even proportionately, the number of people that other countries have tested.But I was with, as an example, a great gentleman yesterday, the president of Mexico. And they are having a hard time, especially in Mexico City. They test when somebody is sick or when somebody goes into the hospital. And that is a different way of doing it, and it's just fine.And we are testing and creating -- it's the greatest thing that ever happen for the opposite party, but we are doing something that nobody has ever done to the extent, and we are doing a great job.But we have a mortality rate, think of this, that's tenfold better than any other. We -- what we are doing is incredible, if you look. You have heard the numbers, tenfold. We have fewer people dying. And our people have done an incredible job.And one other thing. We are very well on the way to a vaccine, very well on the way therapeutically, therapeutics. We're very well on the way. We have a lot of great things happening.We already do. We do have some that are very effective, or at least effective. And a lot of very good things have happened, a lot of really good things. They're doing a great job.But the testing is just showing up all these cases. And if you turn the news on, you will see it's always the word cases. They don't talk about death, because deaths are way down. They talk about cases, all the time, cases. And those cases get better.They -- in most -- most cases, in almost -- I mean, literally, in most cases, they automatically cure. They automatically get better.HANNITY: Joe Biden revealed in a previous rare -- well, a rare appearance out of his bunker or basement bunker, but he revealed that everybody around him, including his Secret Service, are tested every day.I know, having interviewed you, for example, before the Wisconsin town hall that we did, that I was -- I had to have a test before I got around the president.TRUMP: Right.HANNITY: I think, by the way, I think that's the right thing to do for both you and Joe Biden. That is my own opinion.TRUMP: Right.HANNITY: But you're the two people that don't need to wear a mask.And there's been a lot made over the fact that, well, Donald Trump doesn't wear a mask. You're the two people, I would argue, that probably don't need to wear the mask, where the rest of the public might benefit from it.I saw it, anecdotally, in -- I was at the epicenter of this in my local grocery store. They all wore masks, and, thank God, no cashier and no guys stocking the shelves ever got sick in that store. And I would ask them every week.What are your thoughts on not only mask wearing, but, also, do we have enough PPE for Houston and other hot spots as they arise?TRUMP: Well, we do.And we have done a great job, in that we have created a supply chain that's incredible. On ventilators, we are making thousands a week. On PPE, we are doing great. We do.But I think it's fine to wear a mask, if it makes you feel comfortable. I think, under certain conditions, like when you are going into a hospital -- I will be going to Walter Reed to see some of our great soldiers that have been injured, badly injured, and also see some of our COVID workers, the people that have done such a great job.And I expect to be wearing a mask when I go into Walter Reed. You're in a hospital setting. I think it's a very appropriate thing. I have no problem with a mask.I don't think you need one you're tested all the time, everybody around you is tested, you're quite a distance. You talk about social distancing. You're away.Like, I watched Biden walk onto a stage with his -- practically -- like, today, there was almost nobody in the room. He's making a speech. And they have these massive circles. And the circles are very far away from each other to start off with. And then they have just a few people in the audience.And he makes a speech. And he walks onto the stage wearing this massive mask. There's nobody on the stage. And then he takes it off. He likes to have it hang off usually the left ear. I think it makes him feel good, frankly, if you want to know the truth. And I guess that's OK.But when there's nobody around, you don't really have to do that. But he feels it's good. And I'm OK with it, if he wants to do that. He's got the largest mask I think I have ever seen. It covers up a big proportion of his face.HANNITY: So, you will be wearing a mask at Walter Reed?TRUMP: And I think he feels he looks good that way.(LAUGHTER)HANNITY: I think -- look, I walk around with a mask in New York, and I look better. There's no doubt about it.(LAUGHTER)HANNITY: So, you will be wearing a mask at Walter Reed on Friday?TRUMP: Yes, I think, if I'm in the right setting, if I'm with soldiers, people that -- I don't want to spread anything.And it's -- a lot of it is, it's you spreading, not them spreading.HANNITY: Right.TRUMP: It's you spreading. No, and I don't want to cause a problem for anybody. No, I have no problem with masks. But it's got to be done at the right time.Now, I'm usually fairly isolated, as the president, so I'm fairly isolated. Everybody's tested before they come in. They...(CROSSTALK)HANNITY: I wasn't allowed to go around you until I got a test. This...(LAUGHTER)TRUMP: No, I know, but it's -- they do a great job. They really do a great job.No, I have no problem with masks. That's up to you.HANNITY: Let me ask you this.I know, when you built all of these hospitals, you brought in the Navy ship for New York. You built the hospital. You built 3,000 beds at the Javits Center. They only used 1,000. The only used like 200 on the Comfort.But you also manned those beds. You also provided the PPE. But you also converted both the ship and the Javits Center, 3,000 beds.TRUMP: That's right.HANNITY: They only used 1,000 -- to COVID capability.Now, my understanding is, you had to change the ventilation system to actually make that happen.TRUMP: Right.HANNITY: Does that -- and there are reports maybe the RNC is exploring an outdoor venue for the convention in Jacksonville.Is it -- are you convinced, or are the experts telling you the ventilation systems need to be up to a certain standard? I'm not an expert on it.TRUMP: Well, a ship ventilation system is very much -- they circularize. And they are very much under review, to be honest with you.But we did a great job with the Comfort. We did a great job with the Mercy and the Comfort. In Los Angeles, we had a great ship, very -- a sister -- sister ship, a really terrific operation.But when we moved it in, there was -- they didn't send us people. And then they said, could you convert it to COVID? Because it wasn't meant for that. It was meant for operations. But it wasn't getting used, and so the governor asked if we could convert it for COVID. And we did. And they didn't use it.And we took -- the Javits Center did a phenomenal job in record-setting time. A matter of days, we converted into a massive, like, 2,600 units, and they didn't use it, or very little did they use it.And I said, what are you doing with all of these requests, and then you're not using it? What's going on? And if they would have used that, instead of nursing homes, they wouldn't have lost thousands of people in the nursing homes. They could've put people in the Javits Center or they could have put them in the ship.But they put them back in nursing homes. And they were badly infected, and then they ended up hitting the people that are most vulnerable, and thousands of people died.HANNITY: Oh, thousands died, thousands.It was the worst decision. And it was made by New York Governor Cuomo and Pennsylvania Governor Wolf and Murphy in New Jersey and, in Michigan, Governor Whitmer.Let me ask you about today's Supreme Court decisions and rulings. Mark Levin was talking about, as it relates to a mixed bag verdicts, 7-2 decisions. And one would send things to the lower court, but open up the possibility of at least some of your taxes being revealed to a prosecutor in the Southern District of New York, and the other saying no to Congress, they don't have a right to that information.Your thoughts?TRUMP: Well, first of all, I'm under tax audit, OK?So, I mean, they treat -- the IRS treats me just like they used to treat the Tea Party, except worse. And I'm under tax audit. I have been for a long period of time. We made a deal a long time ago. And once I ran for politics, that deal was like -- we didn't make it.So, I am under a continuing audit. And anybody that did that or showed that, before you have it finalized, but they treat -- they treat me horribly, the IRS, horribly. It's a disgrace, what's happened.We had a deal done. In fact, it was -- I guess it was signed even. And once I ran or once I won, or somewhere back a long time ago, everything was like, well, let's start all over again. It's a disgrace.So, I was disappointed. And, at the same time, it was -- because I think we -- a president should get protection from thousands of prosecutors out there, thousands all over the country. They could go after you. And you're supposed to be running the country.I will tell you, Justice Alito wrote a totally brilliant decision. He wrote something today that really got it.HANNITY: Smart man.TRUMP: Justice Thomas, likewise, was great.HANNITY: Another smart man.TRUMP: They were the two that came.So, it was -- look, it basically sends it all back, and we start all over again. I guess that is what it means.HANNITY: Let me ask you some new information as it relates to the deep state, as we call it.We now know that George Papadopoulos, that exculpatory evidence was withheld. We now know, in the case of General Flynn, exculpatory evidence was withheld. And I will get specifically into that January 5 meeting in the White House with Barack Obama and Joe Biden.And, still, I mean, the judges -- even the Department of Justice said, it's time to let that case go. Both parties, when they say that, usually, it ends it. But the judge has a vendetta, clearly, against General Flynn.Then we have -- I thought we were guaranteed the right to a fair and impartial jury. And we discovered that the jury foreperson in the Roger Stone case literally was speaking out publicly in the most negative terms against Roger personally and any Trump supporter.The judge refused to grant him a new trial, which, to me, is unfathomable. I would give that right to every American. If somebody is biased on the jury, that case is out.And then you have -- of course, they dragged out of mothballs the Manafort issue. There's been some reports, especially about Roger Stone.Do you have any plans to either commute sentences or any plans to pardon any of these men?TRUMP: Well, first of all, President Obama and Joe Biden spied on my campaign. They knew everything that was going on. They were in the rooms when everyone was talking about it. These people all worked for them. I know how the White House works, I guess I can say now, better than anybody.And they knew everything that was going on. They spied on my campaign. I said it a long time ago. Nobody believed me. And now it turns out to be fact. So, let's see what happens. But they were the head of it.And it was Comey and Brennan and everybody else, Clapper. And those guys all lied to Congress, and bad things happened, and Strzok and Page, the two lovers, and many other people, many other people. When you look at -- I could go down a list of lots of people.They were spying on my campaign. It was totally illegal. If that were the other way around, the people would be in jail for 50 years, and it would've started two years ago. It's a disgrace, what's going on. We caught them, 100 percent.As far as General Flynn, he's a great hero. He's a great gentleman. What they are doing to that man, they have destroyed that man. But he will come back. He's going to come back.Roger Stone was treated very unfairly, unbelievably unfairly. And I watched that, and I thought it was incredible, the way that man was treated...HANNITY: He's about to go to jail. You know that.TRUMP: ... including with the jury forewoman, who was -- it was disgraceful.And the judge, the way she treated him, I think it was a disgrace that they didn't give him a retrial, Roger Stone.And Papadopoulos, I mean, you -- they have a tape of his conversation. If anything, he is like -- it was a perfect -- as I said about my conversation. I turned out to be right. It was a perfect conversation that Papadopoulos had. And they destroyed him too and put him in jail for two weeks.So these people -- and Paul Manafort, what they did to that man is a disgrace.HANNITY: Have you thought about pardons or commutations at all?TRUMP: I am always thinking. I am always thinking.(LAUGHTER)TRUMP: So, you will be watching, like everybody else in this case. You will be watching.HANNITY: Well, I want...TRUMP: But Roger Stone...HANNITY: Yes.TRUMP: ... Papadopoulos, Manafort, what they did to that man, what they did to that man, putting him in solitary confinement.Al Capone, the great gangster, the ultimate gangster, was never in solitary confinement. You know, what they did to -- what they did to him was just incredible.And, you know, look, it's a very sad thing. Here's a group. We have them cold. They lied. They leaked. They did everything. We have them already. We could get -- they could get more evidence, it doesn't matter. They have them cold.I hope that they act. I hope that Lindsey Graham does something with the Judiciary Committee. We have all the evidence they need. Now, maybe they're getting new stuff. I let them handle that.But the Judiciary Committee should act.HANNITY: I -- well, I would say this.TRUMP: And it's also -- like, people don't like to say, it President Obama.He knew everything. He was probably in charge of it or was in charge of it. Joe Biden, you know, I don't know if he knows where he is, but he was there. He knew everything.HANNITY: Well, he lied. Joe Biden lied to George Stephanopoulos when he said, I know nothing.TRUMP: That's right. That's right.HANNITY: But the notes -- the notes from Peter Strzok were clear about the January 5 meeting.Now, the case against Flynn was to be dropped on January the 4th. Strzok and Comey brought it back to life. But in that meeting in the Oval Office, we know that it was Biden that said, oh, what about bringing up the Logan Act from 1799?TRUMP: That's right.HANNITY: We knew that Obama was saying, maybe we shouldn't tell the incoming administration. Obama said, we want our guys on this.Sally Yates testified she was shocked that Obama knew every aspect of the call. Add to that, we know that premeditated fraud was committed on the FISA court. We know there was Russian interference. We had a Clinton- bought-and-paid-for lying dossier. We know obstruction happened with her with the deleted e-mails and BleachBit and hammers.And we know that there was a quid and a pro and a quo with Joe and zero experience Hunter. There is no doubt that there's, in my mind, a double standard.To me, one of the biggest opponents you have in 117 days is, well, I call them the media mob.What is your thoughts on the media these days, because they don't seem to care about obstruction or Russian interference or quid pro quos if it's a Democrat?TRUMP: And, by the way, Christopher Steele was just adjudged guilty in London...HANNITY: Yes.TRUMP: ... or wherever on what he said about other people with his fake dossier, his phony, disgusting dossier. And he is a part of it too.There are many people part of it that you didn't even mention. You don't have enough time. They have all been caught.Now let's see what happens. But they have all been caught. And they spied on the campaign. You could call it treason. You could call it many different things. But it's very serious.And, so far, nothing's happened...HANNITY: Well, let me ask you about that.TRUMP: ... because the other side is vicious. And I guess the Republicans, they are just not vicious. They're just not -- it's very sad to see.But we have some great ones, though, I will tell you, when you see Jim Jordan, and you see Meadows, and you see Devin Nunes, and you see many of them, many of them, Lee Zeldin. And Kevin is fantastic, Kevin McCarthy. What a job he's doing.We got some -- we have some great ones.But they are straight players. They are very straight players. And the other side, they are not straight players. It's a disgrace, what's happening.And then you look at what's going on in Democrat-run cities, and how horrible it is.And the media is totally corrupt. When I say totally, largely. There are some very fine people I know in the media, some very honorable people. But, largely, it's corrupt, not even fake. It's corrupt.HANNITY: Well, there was -- they never cared about the Russian dossier that was never verifiable, because it was all false, used as a basis of a FISA warrant.You are correct. That was to get a FISA application to spy on your campaign, your transition team, and, in the words of the attorney general, Bill Barr, deep into your presidency.And we are awaiting the work of prosecutor John Durham. We will see where that goes. Attorney General Barr said that this is not about a report. It's a criminal investigation.But, again, that is beyond, I guess, my pay grade.I asked you a question in Wisconsin, and you got criticized for the answer. I want to ask you again.You are now asking America, in 117 days, to give you a second term as president of the United States. Let's -- what is your second term agenda?TRUMP: Well, first of all, I didn't know I was criticized for that answer, because it's a simple question.First of all, we're going to defeat the invisible enemy. And that's -- and we are well on our way, and, again, as I told you, the mortality rate is tenfold down.We are going to rebuild the economy. We're going to bring back jobs from all of these foreign lands that have stolen our jobs on horrible trade deals. We are going to continue to make great trade deals. We're going to finish rebuilding our wall.We're going to finish. We're going to have that. It's going to be almost complete by the end of this year. Shortly thereafter, it's finished. It's made a tremendous difference. You see, we're doing record numbers on the border. Very few people are able to get through.We are rebuilding with our military. We have rebuilt the military, $2.5 trillion. We are fixing up the VA for our vets. What -- the job we have done there, between Choice and Accountability. We have Choice, where they have -- they can go out and get a doctor if they are sick.They don't have to wait for five weeks, six weeks, two weeks. So we are doing great with the vets. And the vets are loving Trump.We are protecting our Second Amendment, so important. We need more judges and more justices. You see that now with the Supreme Court more than ever. And the next president -- I have had two -- and the next president is going to be able to pick two or three or one or whatever, but a lot of justices.And that means everything, whether it's for life or other things. I mean, it means so much.But protecting the Second Amendment, getting more judges, all of the things that we have done, nobody's done what this administration has done in the first three-and-a-half years. Nobody's even come close, when you look at everything that we are doing.Now what we're doing is working on lowering drug prices and knocking out special interests, because it's not easy. We're fighting for choice. We did it for the veterans. Now we are doing it for school too. We want choice in school, so a parent can take their child to a school of their choice.And that's happening, very good -- very, very well. And we have many things we are doing and many things that we have already completed. And you can't do more than what we have done. I think we have set records on every -- we actually set a record on judges.We are going to be -- by the time of the end of this year, we will be up to almost 300 federal judges. And that's a record. That's incredible, including D.C.HANNITY: Where do you see the economy come November 3, Election Day?And in terms of -- we talk about a V-shaped recovery. We had the -- we broke a record in terms of retail sales. They expected a, what, 9.5- million-job lost. You got a 2.5-million-job gain...TRUMP: Right.HANNITY: ... followed by, what, a five-million-job gain.TRUMP: Yes.HANNITY: Personally, I didn't think we would see numbers like that until the earliest of August.Where do you see the economy? Where will we be with the border wall? How many miles come November 3?TRUMP: OK.Well, first of all, the border wall is doing incredibly well. We are moving along. And we are up to about 250 miles already. We will have -- by the end of the year, it will be close to finished. It might take an couple extra months, but we will have it. And it will be -- it's had a huge impact already, because we're about halfway finished.The economy, it's one of the -- it's the thing. The economy is starting to really do great. We are going to have a great third quarter. We are going to have a great fourth quarter. And next year is going to the best, I think one of the best years that we have ever had.(CROSSTALK)TRUMP: And that is the way it looks.HANNITY: There's a lot of records you shattered.TRUMP: You know, the two jobs numbers that you mentioned, the 2.8 and the almost five million, those are record numbers in history.We have never created jobs to the level that we have now. And before the China plague came in, the China virus, whatever you want to call it came in, we were beating everybody so badly, including China. We were beating everybody.China had the worst year they had. The tariffs have hurt them. They had the worst year they have had. And we have taken in billions and billions of dollars in tariffs. They had the worst year in 67 years, whereas we had the best year we have ever had.And then we got hit with the plague. But now we are rebuilding it. And it's going much faster than anybody thought possible, a V.HANNITY: All right, we have less than a minute.You worked with Kanye West and Kim Kardashian for criminal justice reform. You also put in your executive order of police reform. But now Kanye apparently is running for president.What's your reaction?TRUMP: Well, I like his voice being heard, but he's always going to be for us. I mean, he's going to be for us. And his wife is going to be for us.But I like...HANNITY: He said he's taken off the red hat.TRUMP: I mean, he can't -- the problem, he's missed some states, little thing like that. He's missed a few states, like about 12.So, you have to do that. But he's a very good guy. He is a person that I get along with very well. And, in the end, I think he would support us over anyone else. But, you know, if he does or not, look, we have to stop the radical left from taking over our country, ripping down our great heroes.They are ripping down our heroes. When they take down those statues and those monuments, they're rip -- when they take down George Washington...HANNITY: Yes.TRUMP: ... and they take down Abraham Lincoln, and Ulysses S. Grant, and when they take down these people, an abolitionist, people that -- think of it.Abolitionists are being -- because I think most of them don't even know what they are doing. But it's very destructive.HANNITY: Well, I will tell you, Dr. Alveda King...TRUMP: And we are not going to be Venezuela.HANNITY: I did like what Dr. Alveda King said, and that was -- and she's a friend of the program -- is that this garden of heroes that will represent every American from every background.Mr. President, we have gone just a little long here.Thank you for your time. We appreciate you being with us, and 117 days to go. All right.TRUMP: Thank you very much, Sean. Thank you.HANNITY: Hannity.com, we're 26 days away, \"Live Free or America Dies\", Hannity.com.Let not your heart be troubled.Laura Ingraham, I owe you 35 seconds and I'm paying you back tomorrow.
