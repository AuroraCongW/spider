That mandate expired Friday.On Friday, Russia and China used their vetoes for the second time in a week to block a U.N. resolution that passed and would have kept open two border crossings in the country\u2019s rebel-held northwest,  that had also sought to keep them open, and had initially called for a crossing on the northeast border with Iraq to be re-opened.According to The Associated Press, the Friday resolution would have extended the Bab al-Hawa crossing for a year, and the Bab al-Salam crossing for just three months. It is the Bab al-Salam crossing that Russia wants to shut down entirely.That resolution, obtained by The Associated Press, would extend the mandate through the Bab al-Hawa crossing for a year and the mandate for the Bab al-Salam crossing -- which Russia wants to eliminate -- for three months to wind up its activities.Meanwhile, a Russian-drafted resolution that would have reduced the number of crossings to just one failed to receive the nine yes votes needed for it to pass. Only four voted in favor, meaning a veto was not required to stop it.Russia and China have argued that aid should be delivered across conflict lines, and rejected the U.S-backed resolution as continuing \"reliance on temporary and extraordinary mechanisms.

Hope you're having a safe and healthy Fourth of July weekend. I'm Charles Payne, in for Maria Bartiromo. Coming up on \"Sunday Morning Futures\": (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: The courage of those patriots on July 4, 1776 -- the American republic stands today as the greatest, most exceptional and most virtuous nation in the history of the world. (END VIDEO CLIP) PAYNE: President Trump paying tribute to the founding fathers during last night's Salute to America celebration. And with less than four months to go until the election, why the president is calling mail-in voting his biggest concern heading into November. We will hear from U.S. Attorney General Bill Barr on why he says American companies with ties to China are putting short-term profits over long-term viability. Plus: Tennessee setting another single-day record for the new coronavirus cases. Senator Marsha Blackburn joins me to discuss the debate over mask mandates and whether states moved too quickly to reopen, as infection rates spike across the country. And analysis from Gordon Chang on the reasons behind China's newly passed national security law for Hong Kong. All that and more, as we look ahead on \"Sunday Morning Futures.\" The president coming out with a strong defense of U.S. history, while taking aim at the -- quote -- \"radical left\" during a Salute to America celebration, which included a trip to Mount Rushmore and a speech on the White House lawn on July 4. For reaction, let's bring in Republican Senator Marsha Blackburn from Tennessee, who serves on the Armed Services Committee, Commerce, and Judiciary committees. Senator, thanks for joining us. I just want to get your thoughts on those speeches, again, a serious focus on where America has come from, those who helped build America into the greatest country in the world, and a positive look to the future for all Americans. SEN. MARSHA BLACKBURN (R-TN): Oh, Charles, I thought the speech was absolutely one of the best that he has given. And how appropriate that he reminded the American people that we are unique, and that you can bet on hope, or you can bet on fear, but, in this country, you have the ability to do whatever you want to do, to dream those big dreams, and make them come true. And you and I have talked in times past about how we have each put a focus on encouraging young people from underserved areas. And wouldn't it be fabulous to have this national garden, where people could go and be inspired and say, I want to do something that is going to be significant for my country? PAYNE: Yes, it's interesting, because the White House just announcing that they do have plans for a national garden that could possibly open July 4, 2026. The media taking shots, saying it was an arbitrary and random list of Americans. I'm not sure what's so random about John Adams, Susan B. Anthony, Henry Clay, Daniel Boone, Davy Crockett, Franklin Doug -- Frederick Douglass, Amelia Earhart, Martin Luther King Jr., Abraham Lincoln, Douglas MacArthur, Betsy Ross, Harriet Beecher Stowe, Ronald Reagan, Jackie Robinson, Booker T. Washington, Harriet Tubman, George Washington, the Wright brothers, and the list goes on. That sounds like a pretty good list and a pretty good foundation of what shaped and formed who we are today. BLACKBURN: I think it's a great foundation, because you know what? Those of us that studied history and appreciate history can tick through you the list and tell you something of significance that each of those individuals did or said that inspired us in some way. So, as they are putting this list together, I think it is really wonderful. And how appropriate. You're talking about Frederick Douglass and Susan B. Anthony, and this is the year we're celebrating the 19th Amendment and women getting the right to vote. That is going to be August 18, 2020, the centennial celebration. PAYNE: And the speech itself, particularly the one at Mount Rushmore, when the president said that the founding fathers launched a revolution in pursuit of justice, equality, liberty, and prosperity, it kind of reminded me of \"Hamilton,\" right? The biggest media event over the weekend is how many people have watched \"Hamilton.\" And the same folks that said that this is an amazing play, with an inspiring message, found racism, division in these kind of words from President Trump. So, I just can't understand why, at some point, even the media should let their guards down, and let Americans celebrate where we have come and how we have gotten here so fast. BLACKBURN: That is so true. And we want to make certain -- and the president spoke to this. We do not need to erase our nation's history. It is all there, the good, the bad, the ugly, the inspirational, the achievement, the overcoming, the pride that people should take in the fact that they have been able to achieve and do and be. There are millions of people from all across the globe that seek to come to the United States every single year, because they are escaping oppression and because they want to be able to achieve their dreams. And they have read about our land as a land of hope and opportunity and freedom. So, they choose to come here. I think the garden is a great idea. The president's speech was the right tone, talking about this country and this country's achievements and the achievements of our people, which is what makes which makes -- which makes our country great. You know, people felt like President Trump believed in them in 2016. Indeed, he did. PAYNE: Right. BLACKBURN: And he has proven that, and so now to say, here is where we can go with our children and grandchildren and say, this is someone who made a difference in our lives. PAYNE: Senator, I want to switch gears here a little bit. BLACKBURN: Sure. PAYNE: COVID-19 cases have been on the rise throughout the nation. And I think the most recent numbers from Tennessee show a continuing spike in those cases. So, the idea is, what do we do? We do see where masks are now being mandatory in many states that they weren't before. BLACKBURN: Yes. PAYNE: Did we open too quickly? Or was it just sort of a situation where people just were so -- have been so pent up, so cooped up, that they overindulged there. And how long do you think it will get before we're sort of back on track with reopening the nation? BLACKBURN: I think getting back on track very quickly. And here is the reason why. You are seeing people who got out there, their kids got out there, they went to protest, they went into these groups. And now what do you have? You have spikes, whether it was protests or bars or whatever. So, I have talked to a lot of moms who are saying, I have told my kids and my young adults... (LAUGHTER) BLACKBURN: ... you have to wear a mask. You have to wash your hands. PAYNE: Yes. BLACKBURN: And they know they want to get out and about. And, Charles, here's the thing. We cannot afford another lockdown in this economy -- 4.8 million jobs, the jobs report, the numbers were good. People want to go to work. They need to do it safely. They need to wear their masks. They need to wear gloves, use a face shield if they need to. They need to wash their hands. And they need to make certain that their children are -- and even if they're adults, make certain that their children are doing these same things... PAYNE: Yes. BLACKBURN: ... their grandchildren are doing it, because kids have got to get back to school. And kids have got to get back to colleges. If you are not putting kids back in colleges, you don't have young teachers coming along to help teach children. You don't have young medical students getting through medical school and then getting out to do those of residencies and practice medicine. We have to get ourselves back on track. And here's another thing, Charles. We do not want to hand the keys of this economy that is roaring back to life, we don't want to hand those keys to the Marxists and the socialists. PAYNE: We have got less than a minute to go. And I know you're passionate about these two topics. I don't know if we can give answers on both. But, of course, you share President Trump's worries about mail-in voting and the fraud associated with that. BLACKBURN: Yes. PAYNE: But something else that you have been working on with the NCAA, the NIL, name, images and likeness, you have pushed hard for this. And it looks like these student athletes are going to start having some control over their own financial futures because of who they are. BLACKBURN: When it comes to NIL, yes, I think that we have given the NCAA a deadline. If they can't get their act together, we will get it together for them. But they're going to resolve this issue. And we're going to have a standard, so that these parents and these young athletes know what to expect. Likewise, I know you're talking to Gordon in a few minutes. I have been pretty hard on the NBA about their relationship with communist China. And when it comes to dealing with that, they need to be held to account for this. And let me flip to the mail-in voting. I have served on an election commission as a citizen in service in my county. PAYNE: Right. BLACKBURN: I think that we trust our local election commissions to run those elections fair and square. PAYNE: Right. BLACKBURN: That is where the accountability needs to be. I'm very leery of mail-in voting. PAYNE: You're not the only one. Senator Marsha Blackburn, thank you very much. Well, presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden held his first news conference in 89 days this past Tuesday. Up next: President Trump on how he plans to campaign against the former vice president and the concerns that he has over of voting by mail also, as we look ahead on \"Sunday Morning Futures.\" (COMMERCIAL BREAK) PAYNE: Welcome back. With the 2020 presidential election now just 120 days away, President Trump is calling mail-in voting the single biggest threat to his reelection. He recently sat down with Maria Bartiromo for an exclusive interview about why the Democrats want to change how America votes and why he believes it's a danger to our democracy. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) TRUMP: I'm running against the Democrats, and I'm running against the media. I'm running against the radical left. I'm running against some really stupid Republicans that don't understand how good they had it, because we have some Republicans -- I'm at 95 or 96 percent with the Republican Party, but we have some people that claim to be Republicans, and they've gone crazy. And the reason is, I have defeated them all. You know, they were all my opponents, and they've never gotten over it, guys, Weaver and Schmidt, all losers. And they go out and they try buying commercials. And you say, gee, we've rebuilt our military. We've taken care of our vets. Our vets are in the best shape. You've never seen anything like with the vets, with Choice, with everything else.\u00a0 We've done such a good job. And then you add the judges and you add protecting our Second Amendment.\u00a0 And what are these guys going to do? Support Joe Biden?\u00a0 MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: No.\u00a0 \u00a0TRUMP: And, you know, because Joe has been brought way left, way, way left. They've never gotten over losing to me. It wasn't supposed to happen. And then I had another race. It was against crooked Hillary Clinton. And she's never gotten over it either. BARTIROMO: Well, she's been tweeting already, saying that we have to vote by mail. Now, I know that there was interference in the 2016 election. They were out to get you, and they wanted to take you down. There's another kind of interference, and that could be fooling around with voting machines. I mean, in terms of voting by mail, vote proxies, what's your take? Do you want that? TRUMP: So... BARTIROMO: She's been tweeting about that, Hillary. TRUMP: Voting by mail is very dangerous, because people can grab them. People can take that proxy, sign a name. They can -- they can do all sorts of things, especially harvesting. They go out, and they say just -- let's put them all together. And that's happened. And, by the way, we were thinking it might happen in California. We were worried about the race. But, look, in California, they actually won. They voted by mail, the one we just won today. We just won it, vote by mail. And they were losing, because, when you vote by mail, you see the tally, how it's going, right? And we were losing. We were losing that issue. So, we lost that issue. We're voting by mail. We're winning. What happens? They immediately set a voting booth up -- wasn't supposed to -- in the middle of a Democrat area, so they could get votes. But they still didn't do it. We won the race. It's pretty amazing.\u00a0 BARTIROMO: So, why would Nancy Pelosi come up with this $3.9 trillion plan, if she knows... TRUMP: I think she wants -- yes. Yes. BARTIROMO: ... it's dead on arrival, she's knows nobody's going to go for a marijuana business in the middle of a pandemic. What -- I mean... TRUMP: More than anything else, she wants the voter -- the way of voting changed, because, if you did that -- look, they have had some very dishonest things. You look at California. Look at Los Angeles, where Judicial Watch settled a case, where they agreed that a million votes were fraudulent. A million votes in one area were fraudulent. And they could have done a lot more, but it was almost -- it was so ridiculous, there was no reason to go any further. They came to a settlement. They agreed on a million votes. The level of dishonesty with Democrat voting is unbelievable. If you told a Republican to vote twice, they'd get sick at even the thought of it. And you have people that vote numerous times. What's happening is crazy. So, now they want to send out vote by mail. Who's going to -- who knows who's signing this stuff? Not only should they come and vote. Now, if you're a senior citizen, and if you're this or that, like in Florida, there's a great system of voting. But it's a fair system, and it's a very closely watched system.\u00a0 So, in some cases, age, you're not feeling well, you should be able to do it. But you have to go out and vote. And if you don't do that, it can be -- we'll have the worst rigged election since Bernie Sanders, because Bernie Sanders, he has had a lot of bad things happen to him. You know, it's interesting with Bernie Sanders.\u00a0 BARTIROMO: That's a good point. I'm glad you're making that.\u00a0 TRUMP: If Bernie Sanders -- if Elizabeth Warren drops -- and nobody talks about this. I say it all the time, because it's so basic. Elizabeth Warren was a failed candidate, but she got a lot of the super liberal votes, you know, the radical left, I call it. And she didn't drop out of the race Super Tuesday. If she drops out of the race -- she doesn't even have to endorse Bernie Sanders.\u00a0 He wins every state, almost every state against Biden. But she didn't. And then two other people who did drop out, they gave the support to Biden. If -- and despite that, if she does it, because she got thousands of votes. Every one of those races were very close. She -- he would win almost every state, Bernie Sanders. And that was the establishment Democrats killing Bernie Sanders.\u00a0 BARTIROMO: Wow. You know, Mr. President, there are a lot of people today that are very happy that you're so tough, as tough as you are, because there's a statute -- there's a 1947 statute that says Nancy Pelosi would yield all of the powers of the presidency if the president and the vice president could not -- consistent with the law, she could issue whatever executive orders she wanted, fire disfavored political appointees, and, in general, direct the executive branch, as she pleased.\u00a0 She's third in line.\u00a0 TRUMP: It's never going to happen. We'll keep our vice president very healthy, and I will stay healthy. Never going to happen. She would be a disaster. But, look, Nancy Pelosi is a disaster, OK? Even doing a thing like that with her crazy vote, what she wants to do is get involved with the voting. She just got back to Washington.\u00a0 Everybody said, what -- what was so long? She just got back here. So, let's just see how it all works out ... BARTIROMO: So...\u00a0 TRUMP: But I think we're going to have a great election. I'm getting really good poll numbers. For the most part, they're not being shown. And I saw Joe Biden on television yesterday. And if you watch him, he knows nothing. He knows absolutely nothing. BARTIROMO: Do you think he will be the candidate?\u00a0 TRUMP: I don't know. I just don't know. I mean, I'm looking -- normally, it's -- of course he's going to be the candidate. Again, if Elizabeth Warren, Pocahontas, as I affectionately call her, because her whole life was a fraud -- if Elizabeth Warren just got out before Super Tuesday, it would be Bernie. I don't care who it is. It doesn't matter. I actually would prefer, Joe. I think I would prefer Joe. Who knows, right, about those things. But a lot of people wonder, is he going to be the candidate? BARTIROMO: But, you know, how will you be positioning yourself for the election? Because people voted for you because they trusted your economic smarts. They knew you could turn things around for the economy and business. You're a business... TRUMP: And I did.\u00a0 \u00a0BARTIROMO: The first business president. Exactly. TRUMP: Look... BARTIROMO: Unemployment potential. TRUMP: ... we had to turn off our country. We had the greatest -- as we say... BARTIROMO: So, will you position yourself differently going into this election? TRUMP: No, I don't think so. I'm going to do it again. I got to do it again. I did it once. I showed it can be done. (END VIDEOTAPE) PAYNE: Coming up: The Department of Justice continues its probe into the origins of the Russia investigation. Attorney General Bill Barr on where the investigation stands now, as we look ahead on \"Sunday Morning Futures.\" (COMMERCIAL BREAK) PAYNE: Welcome back. As U.S. Attorney General John Durham continues his investigation into the origins of the Russia probe, these newly declassified handwritten notes by former FBI agent Peter Strzok reveal President Obama and Vice President Joe Biden first raised the Logan Act during an Oval Office conversation about Michael Flynn on January 5, 2017, just weeks before President Trump's inauguration. Attorney General Bill Barr recently spoke exclusively with Maria Bartiromo about why the FBI was targeting the incoming administration and who the mastermind might be. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BARTIROMO: A source said to me a couple of years ago, speaking of the Russia collusion story, that this was the closest the United States ever game to a coup to take down a president since the assassination of Lincoln. Is that an appropriate statement? WILLIAM BARR, U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL: In this sense. I think it is the closest we have come to an organized effort to push a president out of office. BARTIROMO: And it continues. BARR: But what -- you know, I'm not reaching a judgment as to what the motivations there were. BARTIROMO: Can you tell us anything about how this all started? This is not just an American citizen. This was a man running for president, and this was a person who got elected to become the president. And the FBI thought it was a good idea to launch an investigation into Donald Trump and potential collusion. Why? BARR: You know, I guess I don't want to talk about that. Some of it may become evident as the -- as more facts are disclosed. But I think there were probably a range of motives for different people. BARTIROMO: But is there any evidence that, in fact, it was appropriate to launch an investigation, other than a conversation in a bar? I know that George Papadopoulos had a conversation in a bar. BARR: That is the official version of what happened, that that comment in a London wine bar was what the basis really was for going forward. And I have said that I thought that that was a very slender reed to get law enforcement intelligence agencies involved in investigating the campaign of one's political opponent. BARTIROMO: Lindsey Graham told us that four FBI case agents talked to the Russian subsource, in other words, the person who compiled some of the information in the dossier, and that subsource told those agents that it was just bar talk, that it wasn't true, that we didn't really buy it anyway. Did those case agents tell their superiors that? BARR: Again, I don't want to get into the details, because those are the kinds of things we're looking at. But that whole vignette is laid out to some extent in the I.G.'s report, that, in January 2017 and in March 2017, they talked to the primary subsource, who was the sole conduit for this information that made up the dossier. And, as I have said, the dossier pretty much collapsed at that point. And yet they continued to use it as a basis for pursuing this counterintelligence investigation. BARTIROMO: So, does it sound like Jim Comey and Andrew McCabe knew that the dossier had collapsed in January of 2017? BARR: I don't want to discuss that aspect of it. BARTIROMO: Is there any culpability from the media? Because, probably, you couldn't really have the story as broad-based and loud in your face as we had it without the media. BARR: Generally, as a practical matter, no, there's -- there's little risk of liability for the -- for a reporter to disclose information that they have obtained. Now, sometimes, news organizations may go too far in soliciting and obtaining that information, which could create problems for them. But, generally speaking, it's very hard to go after the reporters. BARTIROMO: Ric Grenell calls the transition period key. What can you tell us about the transition period that we need to understand better? BARR: Well, it depends on what the motivations were and why they were looking at it. But it is -- I would say it's unusual for an outgoing administration, high- level officials, to be unmasking very much in the days they're preparing to leave office. It makes you wonder what they were doing. BARTIROMO: And in that meeting on -- the Oval Office meeting that now is much talked about on January 5, 2017, when President Obama and Vice President Biden were there, along with their deputies, they talked about the Logan Act with regard to General Flynn. That was the first time I had heard that become an issue, given that they were pursuing collusion with Russia. So, was that an opportunity to just try to take down Flynn any way they could? BARR: Well, we have said what we have to say about Flynn in our filing to dismiss the charges. And we discuss the invocation, to the extent that it was invoked, of the Logan Act. But the Logan Act was, in my view, facially absurd to raise in this context, where you have an incoming national security adviser. This wasn't just a private citizen engaged in negotiations to the detriment of the United States. This was somebody coming into office in a transition, which is an officially recognized function of the United States, and discussing future relations. BARTIROMO: Adam Schiff is an elected official, the chairman of the Intel Committee. When these guys speak, you stop and listen. Adam Schiff said multiple times that there was collusion in plain sight. Is it no accountability for an elected official, someone that the public obviously trusts just by their resume, to say one thing in a closed-door situation, when you're under oath, like so many in the Obama administration said, we have no evidence of collusion, but then they went out on television and they said the complete opposite? They said, \"Collusion is in plain sight.\" That's a quote from Adam Schiff. \"The president committed treason.\" That's a quote from John Brennan. Is there no accountability? Can Adam Schiff, because he's an elected official, not be under oath and lead a witness anywhere he wants, even if he's lying, and just get away with it, no problem? And the rest of us are all under oath. BARR: Well, as far as public comments like these people have been making in press conferences and on television and so forth, you know, the accountability is really elections for Schiff. That's why we have elections. If the people of his district want him to continue to behave as he has, then they can send him back to office. It is infuriating, and it's the same phenomenon I discussed with the media, which is, the media misled the American people grossly over a long period of time with exaggerated claims and misinformation. And they haven't been held accountable, and the same for a lot of these talking heads who were out there saying that their information was that the president and his family were going to be indicted on Friday. Nothing happens. And then, later, when it turns out there's nothing there, whoops, I guess -- I guess I thought there was stuff there that I -- you know, apparently wasn't -- and then on to the next misinformation campaign. BARTIROMO: So, did the media -- was the media aiding and abetting this narrative? BARR: They were certainly driving it... BARTIROMO: Yes. BARR: ... and apparently working closely with people who -- other individuals who were driving it as well. (END VIDEOTAPE) PAYNE: We will have more of Maria's interview with Attorney General Bill Barr, as we look ahead on \"Sunday Morning Futures.\" (COMMERCIAL BREAK) \u00a0PAYNE: Welcome back. On Tuesday, the FCC officially declared Chinese telecom companies Huawei and ZTE as national security threats. The decision prevents U.S. companies from using government subsidies to buy equipment from Huawei and ZTE. Attorney General Bill Barr recently spoke with Maria Bartiromo about China's technological ambitions and why the future of America is at risk. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BARTIROMO: Can you tell me a bit about what the CCP is doing? I know there's been a real rethinking of the relationship between the United States and China. BARR: The way I look at is, this is fundamental challenge to the United States. Since the late 19th century, our opportunity and our growth, our prosperity as a country has come from our technological leadership. We have been the technological leader of the world. In the last decade or so, China has been putting on a great push to supplant us, explicitly. They want to be the leader in all the future technologies that are going to dominate the economy. And so what's at stake is the economic opportunity of our children and our grandchildren, whether we can continue to be the technological leader of the world. The Chinese have embarked on a very aggressive program during this time of stealing and cheating in order to overtake us. They have stolen our intellectual property. When they steal our secrets about future technology, they're stealing the future of the American people. If they start leading in some of these fundamental foundational technologies like 5G, which will be the platform of much of our future manufacturing in the United States, they will have tremendous leverage over the United States. If all our industrial practices and our manufacturing practices are built on a platform that they dominate, they will have ultimate leverage over the West. So, I think this is a competition for the future. They haven't been competing fairly. And the president has confronted this, when no one else has. And the American business community has been a big part of the problem, because they're willing, ultimately, many of them, to sacrifice the long-term viability of their companies for short-term profit, so they can get their stock options and move into the Gulf resort. That's what's driving some of this. They're not taking the long-term view and the national view of the American -- of maintaining the American strength. BARTIROMO: Well, I was talking with one money manager the other day. And he said: Look, Maria, I'm not going to call good guys and bad guys. It's not my role to call out good guys and bad guys. So, yes, the growth is in China, and that's where I want to invest. BARR: Well, you know what? We're not speaking German today because the American business in the past didn't think that way. They stood with the United States. And all the privileges and the benefits and the stability and the rule of law and the ability to profit as they do, both as companies and individuals, comes from the strength of this country. We are clearly cracking down on researchers and others that are sent over here to get involved in our key technological programs. And, by the way, this is not just weapons systems. This is agriculture. This is medicine. This is robotics. This is artificial intelligence and so forth. It's the whole gamut of important technologies going forward. BARTIROMO: So, are they seeking out people like the chairman of the chemistry department at Harvard to try to get those people to work with them? Are they seeking people out? BARR: The Chinese efforts run the gamut from more traditional espionage of recruiting people to work for them, explicitly, to cultivating relationships that they are then able to use. And the people frequently are not completely attuned to the fact that they are being used as essentially stooges for the Chinese. So, it runs the gamut of things. And, sometimes, some of these programs, high-sounding programs, are used to the advantage of the Chinese. So, the American business community, we need their understanding of the nature of the problem right now. BARTIROMO: So, what about the Huawei threat? We know that there are backdoors in some cases where data in the Huawei infrastructure goes back to the Chinese Communist Party. We have talked about that a lot. Is that true? BARR: Yes. BARTIROMO: Would the U.S. consider acquiring... BARR: I would say -- I would say, there is certainly the capacity to do that, and a very high risk of that. BARTIROMO: Would the U.S. consider acquiring Ericsson and Nokia to send a message to the world that, if you use Ericsson and Nokia, you have got the backing of the United States government, as an alternative to Huawei? BARR: So, I mean, I gave a speech a while back saying that it was -- that the two companies best positioned to compete with Huawei are Ericsson and Nokia. But unlike Huawei -- Huawei has the backing of the Chinese government and all the Chinese government money. So, just to give you an example, for 5G network facilities, the total global addressable market is probably around $90 billion, and the Chinese government has set up a fund of 100 -- over $100 billion to subsidize it. So, they can go to countries and say, hey, we will put this in cash-free, very cheap money. So, that's what we're competing against with Huawei. And companies like Ericsson and Nokia are the strongest Western competitors in this sector. BARTIROMO: So, you would be OK taking a stake, even if it's a minority stake, in these companies to offset the threat of Huawei, then? BARR: That's not a decision for the Justice Department. I do think that the West has to pick a horse or horses. BARTIROMO: Is China using this COVID-19 pandemic to gain leverage and gain territory? We know that the CCP is overreaching in Hong Kong and militarizing the South China Sea. BARR: I'm concerned that they might think that we are sufficiently distracted by COVID that we won't be able to respond. And I am concerned that they may think the current environment is one in which they can push the envelope somewhat and take advantage of it. BARTIROMO: What's most important in terms of protecting U.S. national security? BARR: First, I think protecting American technological leadership, as I have discussed, and I would also say thwarting their espionage and influence activities are the most important things we can do, and also, through international partners, press the Chinese to play by the rules, play by the rules of the road, which they haven't done. You know, it's too bad that one of the great tragedies, I think, has -- the Chinese people are a great people, with a great history, very industrious and able. And the hope was that, by bringing them into the world system and economic system, there would be a liberalization of their government. But I think the Communist Party still has an iron grip on that country. And I think that's unfortunate. (END VIDEOTAPE) PAYNE: Anger in Hong Kong after China passes a controversial new law that cracks down on political dissent and could severely restrict civil liberties in the former British colony. Asia analyst Gordon Chang says this could mean the end of one country/two systems. He joins us next, as we look ahead on \"Sunday Morning Futures.\" (COMMERCIAL BREAK) \u00a0(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BARTIROMO: What really concerns so many people is that this law seems to be sending a warning to the United States and other countries, because several parts of the security legislation take aim at the perceived role of foreigners. SEN. MARCO RUBIO (R-FL): I think anyone at this point that travels to Hong Kong, whether it's an American businessman or a Canadian businessman or anything, for that matter, is out of their minds. What this basically says now, that law now says that, whether you're a Chinese citizen or a resident of Hong Kong or not, if you have said things or done things critical of the Chinese government, and you step foot on Hong Kong, they now reserve the right to arrest you. (END VIDEO CLIP) PAYNE: That was Florida Senator Marco Rubio speaking on \"Mornings With Maria\" after Hong Kong police made dozens of arrests in the first day after the passage of a controversial new national security law, sweeping legislation that could potentially erode any remaining autonomy in the city. I want to bring in Asia analyst Gordon Chang. He is the author of \"The Coming Collapse of China,\" also a senior fellow at the Gatestone Institute. Gordon, thanks for joining us. Senator Rubio suggesting that even American businessmen at this point would be wise to avoid Hong Kong. Is it that dangerous right now? GORDON CHANG, AUTHOR, \"THE COMING COLLAPSE OF CHINA\": Well, it certainly is, because we don't know the scope of this national security law, but, on paper, it gives China the ability to imprison anybody that it wants. And, indeed, you don't even have to go to Hong Kong to be at risk, because Hong Kong and China have extradition treaties with other countries. And Article 38 of this law says that any comment, any statement on foreign soil by a foreigner is a violation of the national security law if it advocates succession, terrorism, collusion, sedition, all the rest of it. PAYNE: Gordon, there was a sort of game of cat and mouse, if you will, ahead of the official vote on this. We knew it was coming. America took action. Congress took action. President Trump took action as well. And still China steamrolled ahead with this anyway. What's the message that they're sending by -- when it's acknowledged that this has actually galvanized political foes, not just in America, but around the world, ahead of this passage? CHANG: Yes, China is saying that it not only demands the total obedience of people in China. It demands the total obedience of people in Hong Kong. And, Charles, let's not make any mistake about this. China demands total obedience from everybody else in the world. It can't enforce that right now, but that really is the message. PAYNE: The one country/two systems agreement, is that effectively out the window? CHANG: Yes, it is. China promised a high degree of autonomy under the one country/two systems formula for 50 years. Now, 23 years in, that's no longer the case, because the national security law allows China to do anything it wants in Hong Kong. And, indeed, as we talked about, its scope is international. So, comments or activities outside of China and Hong Kong are subject to this national security law. PAYNE: Gordon, you know the dissidents' movement in Hong Kong pretty well. Are they going to be able to overcome this, even, of course, in the back -- with the backdrop of coronavirus? Because it feels like China really is -- this is it. They're going to stamp out this potential revolutionary period. CHANG: I think the answer is yes, because really what we have is more than just a protest movement, Charles. We have an insurgency. And we know that insurgencies can disappear for times, but they can come back, and they usually do. Now, in Hong Kong, we have seen the pro-democracy forces be intimidated. So, for instance, people deleted their Twitter accounts. They also disbanded pro-democracy organizations. And some people, indeed, have already fled. But, nonetheless, we did see protests on July 1, which had marked the handover from Britain to China. PAYNE: All right. CHANG: So, this is going to continue. PAYNE: Folks, we will have more with Gordon Chang in just a moment, as we look ahead on \"Sunday Morning Futures.\" (COMMERCIAL BREAK) PAYNE: We're back with Gordon Chang. Gordon, just before your segment, Maria Bartiromo speaking with Attorney General Bill Barr, and she mentioned that a lot of Wall Street folks aren't interested in picking good guys vs. bad guys. And, of course, it really -- he bristled at the idea that they would think this way, noting that this is not about profits, this is about the future for our children and grandchildren, and maybe Wall Street and these big businesses are not taking that seriously enough. CHANG: Well, they're certainly not, Charles. But we have got to remember that business is generally amoral. And it's not up to them to determine national security policy. That's up to the president of the United States. And it's also up to the president to implement it. So, although I think Wall Street and American business are engaging in really terrible and disgusting tactics, nonetheless, it's up to Washington to stop them. PAYNE: You know, the same -- by the same token, I was on \"FOX & Friends\" this morning, and I said, we haven't been paying attention to China. When I said we, I meant as a nation, because of our media. You have been on this for years. Maria has been on this for at least three or four years. And I think we're overlooking the threat here. What do you make of that, that this is a building time bomb that we're going to have to deal with at some point, maybe sooner, rather than later? CHANG: You're absolutely right about that, Charles. In the last week, we have heard several Chinese officials and former officials talk about an all-out confrontation with the United States. They say they need to prepare for it. Obviously, we're not deterring China. There's a Chinese military that killed 20 Indian soldiers on June 15. And I think it has not satisfied its bloodlust. So, we have got to be extremely concerned what happens next, because Chinese leaders are engaging in provocative conduct across the world and across their region. PAYNE: I have got less than a minute to go, Gordon. But, on that point, I feel like Taiwan might be where we're heading, a confrontation there. If you read between the lines, it looks like that's building pretty rapidly. CHANG: You're right. Xi Jinping, the Chinese ruler, has on a number of occasions this year threatened an invasion of Taiwan. The Chinese officials have warned Secretary of State Pompeo that this is a red line. And, indeed, Chinese military has engaged in some very provocative behavior around Taiwan and over Taiwan. PAYNE: Gordon Chang, as always, thank you very, very much, a very important topic.

Ultimate victory depends on our scientific preeminence rooted in the longstanding and often unspoken principles of integrity, transparency, cooperation, openness, impartiality, respect, freedom of inquiry, reciprocity and accountability to the American people.Yet these principles \u2014 and the security and integrity of America\u2019s  enterprise \u2014 are being undermined by some researchers and foreign governments that are robbing the American people of federal research dollars, new discoveries and innovations.These threats impact our public health and national security. For example, the FBI and Department of Homeland Security recently warned that the People\u2019s Republic of China was attempting to steal American vaccine and therapeutics research \u2014 an unconscionable act in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic.The Trump administration has taken decisive action to protect the U.S. research enterprise. Through the groundbreaking Joint Committee on the Research Environment (JCORE), the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy has led a year-long effort marshalling the entire research community to combat these challenges and ensure America remains the most innovative nation in the world.JCORE addresses not only direct intellectual property theft, but also the broad range of increasingly widespread and systemic attempts to subvert our research enterprise.For decades, governments have rightfully sought to attract global talent to advance their own scientific interests. However, some foreign government-sponsored talent programs \u2014 in particular some sponsored by the Chinese Communist Party \u2014 operate with the intent to import or acquire scientific and technological advancements through means that violate the integrity of the research enterprise and sometimes even violate laws.Often using certain of its more than 200 talent recruitment programs along with lucrative financial packages, the Chinese government has enticed U.S.-based scientists, researchers and students \u2014 irrespective of their country of origin \u2014 to secretly transfer or steal federally funded work.Across the world, the Chinese government has recruited at least 7,000 \u201chigh-end professionals\u201d into its talent programs. Compromised scientists sometimes operate labs in China mirroring U.S.-sponsored facilities, misappropriate research findings, and steal intellectual property.The vast majority of U.S.-based scientists, irrespective of their country of origin, operate with integrity and contribute significantly to our research enterprise. However, some have violated longstanding conflict-of-interest rules by failing to disclose foreign financing while receiving American taxpayer-funded grants, often for the same work.In one notable case, the chair of Harvard University\u2019s Chemistry Department allegedly lied to investigators about his participation in China\u2019s Thousand Talents Program, through which he established a research laboratory in Wuhan, China.Recently, 54 scientists were fired or resigned after an investigation by the National Institutes of Health uncovered violations including undisclosed financial ties to foreign governments. Ninety-three percent of those scientists received hidden funding from a Chinese institution.When such individuals break the rules, Beijing gains improper access to some of the $150 billion of annual U.S. taxpayer-funded research. These nefarious actions not only put our security at risk, but also undermine the foundational integrity of our research enterprise and risk eroding the American public\u2019s trust in researchers and research outcomes at a moment when science is needed most.The Trump administration is leading a comprehensive, enterprise-wide response equal to the threat. Just last month, President Trump issued a proclamation denying visas to certain graduate students and researchers affiliated with Chinese institutions carrying out Beijing\u2019s Military-Civil Fusion strategy. This policy will prevent the Chinese Communist Party from exploiting access to our nation\u2019s educational and research centers to advance its military development.Even before this action, the White House has coordinated over two dozen federal research and development, law enforcement, and national security agencies through JCORE to strengthen the security and integrity of our research enterprise.Over the last year, JCORE has focused its efforts on identifying the scope and scale of risks, generating guidance for federal agencies to strengthen protection of U.S. government-supported research and development against foreign government interference and exploitation, and developing recommendations for academic and research institutions.But the federal government cannot address these risks alone. That is why, through JCORE, we have gathered leaders from the private sector, academia, nonprofit and philanthropic organizations, and professional societies to ensure the collective actions we take balance the openness critical to the conduct of research with our need to protect our research enterprise.I personally have met with allies abroad and visited academic institutions across America to hear directly from those experiencing similar threats. The Trump administration is also working closely with Congress, which has shown strong bipartisan support on these issues.In President Trump, our innovators have a champion in the White House who is fiercely standing up for American values and defending our research system from foreign subversion. JCORE is at the center of this president\u2019s whole-of-nation effort to protect American interests and defend our hard-earned research.The Trump administration\u2019s commitment to honest and principled research will continue to unite, inspire and guide the American research enterprise so it remains the envy of the world.", "comment": "(70)", "topic": "OPINION", "date": " July 16"}, {"cover": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/07/156/88/AP20191557535625.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "title": "UN Security Council passes resolution authorizing cross-border aid to Syria, after Russian opposition", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/politics/un-security-council-resolution-syria-crossing", "subtitle": "The U.N.

It needed nine votes to pass and no vetoes. It will renew the Syrian cross-border aid program, which expired Friday, but only via a single border crossing in the northwest.The program allows aid to be funneled into Syria by keeping open crossings on the borders in the north of the war-torn country. Russia in January vetoed a resolution that would see four crossings opened and forced the council to pass a resolution that reduced it to just two in the northwest on the border with Turkey: Bab al-Salam and Bab al-Hawa.Humanitarian groups and officials had warned of a humanitarian catastrophe if the program was allowed to expire, particularly with the COVID-19 outbreak -- and  there could be\u00a0\"mass graves\" if Russia didn't drop its opposition to it being extended.A majority at the council, including the U.S., wanted both those crossings extended, and a third crossing -- Al Yarubiyah -- opened on the northeast border with Iraq in order to get aid to an estimated 1.3 million stranded Syrians in need of medical supplies.Al Yarubiyah was removed from the resolution to overcome a Russian veto, but Russia and China still wielded their vetoes twice, on Tuesday and on Friday. Russian drafted amendments and resolutions, meanwhile, were repeatedly shot down overwhelmingly, with no need for vetoes.Saturday\u2019s resolution keeps Bab al-Hawa open for 12 months, but it means Bab al-Salam will close, and there will be no border crossing open in the northeast.Craft, who had visited the refugee camps in March, said it was a victory that Bab al-Hawa was kept open, but expressed disappointment at the loss of the other two crossings.\u201cTo be clear, today\u2019s outcome leaves us sickened and outraged at the loss of the Bab\u00a0 Al Salam and Al Yaroubia border crossings. Behind those locked gates are millions of women, children, and men who believed that the world had heard their pleas. Their health and welfare are now at great risk,\u201d she said.\u201cYet there is no question that the Council\u2019s authorization of cross-border humanitarian access through Bab al-Hawa for 12 months is a victory in light of the Russian Federation and the People\u2019s Republic of China\u2019s willingness to use their veto to compel a dramatic reduction in humanitarian assistance,\u201d she said.Secretary Antonio Guterres, meanwhile, said that the reauthorization would ensure assistance for 2.8 million people in the northwest.\u201cThe Secretary-General also reiterates his call on all parties to the conflict to ensure humanitarian access to all people in need in accordance with international humanitarian law,\u201d spokesman Stephane Dujarric said.Russia, meanwhile, claimed\u00a0that \u201cthe cross-border mechanism was used by some external players as a tool to freeze dividing lines in Syria thus jeopardizing integrity of Syria breaking apart its regions.\u201d\u201cIt contradicts the principle of respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Syrian Arab Republic, which has been repeatedly confirmed in the Security Council resolutions, including this resolution,\u201d Russian Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia said in an explanation of its vote.The Russian and Chinese blockage of broader resolutions\u00a0also saw\u00a0criticism from humanitarian groups.\u201cThe cynical and cruel maneuvering of Russia with China\u2019s support is one more tragic example of the broken U.N. humanitarian system, and a defamation of the Security Council's charter,\u201d Susannah Sirkin, director of policy at the U.S.-based Physicians for Human Rights, said in a statement. \u201c Exercising their veto over the will of the Council and succeeding in closing one critical border crossing risks cutting off life-saving aid to more than four million Syrians.\u201dThe negotiations make clear the difficulties the U.S and other countries face in overcoming opposition from Russia in particular -- Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad\u2019s closest ally -- to pass Syria-related resolutions at the Security Council given Russia's veto power.The Friday vetoes mark the 15th and 16th veto by Russia of a Syria resolution since the Syrian conflict began in 2011 and the ninth and 10th by China.", "comment": "", "topic": "UNITED NATIONS", "date": " July 11"}, {"cover": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/07/156/88/Taiwan-Protest-1.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "title": "Ireland eyed for potential 'charter city' for millions fleeing Hong Kong: report", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/world/ireland-charter-city-hong-kong-china-national-security-law", "subtitle": "Ireland is being considered as a possible location for an \u201cinternational charter city\u201d to be developed in anticipation of a mass exodus of Hong Kongers fleeing China\u2019s tightening grasp on their home.", "keyword": "China and Security", "website": "Fox News", "author": "Danielle Wallace", "content": " is being considered as a possible location for an \u201cinternational charter city\u201d to be developed in anticipation of a mass exodus of  fleeing \u2019s tightening grasp on their home.

Australia also promised to give some 10,000 Hong Kongers on student and temporary visas a pathway to permanent residency.Though the Republic of Ireland is not a part of the U.K., the country remains at the top of Ko\u2019s list for a charter city since it has hosted special economic zones in the past, including the Shannon Free Trade Zone and the International Financial Services Centre (IFSC) in Dublin. But plans have not been finalized, as Ireland remains a part of the European Union. Generally, European state aid rules prevent members of the bloc from giving aid to companies not available to their competitors.Though the U.K. and Australia may have made it easier for Hong Kongers to relocate, it remains too early to tell if there will indeed be a mass exodus from the city amid uncertainty over the national security law.

A Congressional Research Service summary of the legislation says it provides for sanctions against \"foreign individuals and entities that materially contributed to China's failure\" to respect Hong Kong's autonomy and \"foreign financial institutions that knowingly conducted a significant transaction with such identified individuals and entities.\"The sanctions against financial institutions would be mandatory and the sanctions against \"entities and individuals\" would be at the discretion of the president, unless they are named on State Department reports as helping violate Hong Kong's autonomy for two consecutive years.The Senate passed a similar bill earlier this month. The sponsors of that bill, Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., and Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., said they plan on getting the Senate to match its legislation with the House's to send it to the president's desk \"as soon as\" Thursday.\"Tens of thousands of Hongkongers are in the streets protesting and refusing to surrender their basic rights to the Chinese Communist Party,\" Toomey and Van Hollen said.\u00a0\"They are doing so even as CCP collaborators harshly crackdown on free speech and the right to assemble.

The New Strategic Arms Reduction\u00a0Treaty (START), which was signed in 2010 by former President Barack Obama and then Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, was made in accordance with the original nuclear arms deal from 1987 and worked to further eliminate the creation and stockpiles of nuclear arms.President Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin pulled out of the 1987 nuclear arms treaty last year, leaving the START treaty as the only nuclear non-proliferation agreement between the two countries.Should the treaty expire, it would be the first time the U.S. and Russia were not united in a nuclear arms agreement since the Cold War.Lavrov said that Russia would be willing to extend the treaty which is set to expire in Feb. 2021 without contingencies, but the U.S. is demanding that China sign the new agreement as well.China has repeatedly said they will not enter into an agreement that requires they reduce their nuclear arms.\u201cThe U.S. has conducted more nuclear testing than others, over a thousand at home and abroad, causing unspeakable damage to other countries' ecological environment,\u201d Hua said Friday. \u201cBy dragging China into this issue, it seeks to let itself off the hook and out of the straitjacket.\u201dShe added that China was one of the first signatories of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, an agreement that bans all testing of nuclear weapons, in 1996. \u201cWe hope the U.S. will stop playing dumb,\u201d Hua said from Friday\u2019s press conference.\u201cWith the largest nuclear arsenal, the US should respond to international concern, earnestly fulfill its special and primary responsibilities to nuclear disarmament, respond positively to Russia's call on extending the New START and further drastically reduce its nuclear arms stockpile.\u201d", "comment": "", "topic": "China", "date": " July 17"}, {"cover": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/156/88/c09264fb149244f3b2d4cd852fa74e4c.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "title": "Ambassador Craft hits China, Russia for backing Syrian regime's 'campaign of brutality'", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/politics/ambassador-craft-hits-china-russia-for-backing-syrian-regimes-campaign-of-brutality", "subtitle": "Russia and China vetoed a United Nations Security Council draft resolution to extend cross-border humanitarian aid from Turkey into Syria for another year, despite warnings that Syrian citizens rely on the aid.", "keyword": "China and Security", "website": "Fox News", "author": "Caitlin McFall", "content": " and  vetoed a United Nations Security Council draft resolution to extend cross-border humanitarian aid from Turkey into  for another year, despite warnings that Syrian citizens rely on the aid.\u201cIt has never been clearer that Russia and China see the  as just another tool to advance their narrow national agendas at the expense of millions\u00a0of innocent Syrian women, children, and men\u00a0who do not have the means to feed, shelter, or provide necessary medical care for their families,\u201d Ambassador Kelly Craft said in a statement to Fox News Tuesday.The Syrian civil war, which has continued for the last nine years, has been responsible for the death of nearly half a million Syrians, and displaced 11 million people, roughly half the size of the country\u2019s population prior to the war.Approximately 2.8 million people now rely on the humanitarian aid that the U.N.

Its mass detention of Uyghurs, its godless decisions to replace church displays of the Ten Commandments with words from General Secretary Xi have not gone without being called out.\"Despite the recent tough talk, the administration has seemed to take a hodgepodge of stances on criticizing China, oftentimes depending on the issue. Trump has railed against China for taking advantage of the United States on trade deals since the 2016 campaign. But\u00a0he's often praised Chinese President Xi Jinping himself.Meanwhile, the U.S. has maintained a consistent message against China's claims in the South China Sea during the Trump administration, regularly executing freedom of navigation operations with U.S. Navy vessels. But Trump himself roiled Republicans last fall when he congratulated Xi on his country's 70th anniversary, refraining from any criticism of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).The Trump administration has sought to stymie the Chinese-controlled tech company Huawei from global 5G networks \u2014\u00a0something it just secured a major victory\u00a0at with the United Kingdom recently deciding to freeze Huawei out of its 5G infrastructure. But Trump, according to a memoir by his former National Security Adviser John Bolton, had indicated he personally didn't care about China's repression of ethnic minorities, specifically the Uyghur Muslims.\"At the opening dinner of the Osaka G20 meeting, with only interpreters present, Xi explained to Trump why he was basically building concentration camps in Xinjiang. According to our interpreter, Trump had said that Xi should go ahead with building the camps, which he thought was exactly the right thing to do,\" Bolton said. \"[Deputy National Security Advisor Matt] Pottinger told me Trump said something very similar during the 2017 trip to China, which meant we could cross repression of Uighurs off our list of possible reasons to sanction China, at least as long as trade negotiations continued.\"Trump and those in his administration have repeatedly condemned Bolton and his book, denying many of the allegations it contains.Now, amid the continuing fallout from the president's handling of the coronavirus pandemic, with Trump angrily deflecting blame for the virus toward China -- where it originated -- Pompeo and the State Department are putting rhetorical pressure on China with\u00a0renewed vigor.\"Countries that want to be global powers, countries that want to participate on the global stage, have a corresponding obligation to comply to the promises they make. China made a promise to the World Health Organization. There's a set of rules about disclosure, and when you have\u00a0 an incident in your country that could potentially lead to a pandemic, you have an obligation to report that and allow others co tome in and helo,\" Pompeo said in a video tweeted last week that was originally on The Hill's \"Virtually Live.\"The United States has withdrawn from the World Health Organization over its alleged compliance with China in covering up the coronavirus in its initial stages.Pompeo added: \"The Chinese Communist Party chose differently, they co-opted the World Health Organization to achieve that coverup, and the result today is that we have hundreds of thousands of people who have died and trillions of dollars in global damage as a direct result.\"Trump got at a similar point in an interview with \"Fox News Sunday.\"\"It came from China. They should've never let it escape. They should've never let it out,\" he said.Trump later continued: \"The World Health got a tremendous amount wrong. They basically did whatever China wanted them to. And we'll save now almost $500 million a year, which is nice. But the World Health got a lot wrong.\"China, meanwhile, has shot back in the diplomatic war of words, accusing the United States of mishandling the coronavirus and even at one point falsely accusing the U.S. Army of introducing the virus into China.\"The #US politicizes #COVID19 response at home and uses 'attacking China'\u00a0as a panacea for domestic problems. A real-life #HouseofCards\u00a0is on in #Washington, with people's lives at stake,\" Hua Chunying, a  for the country's foreign ministry, said in a tweet last week.It's unclear where U.S.-China relations could go from this increasingly hostile juncture, with another grand trade deal, cooperation on North Korea or reconciliation on geopolitical claims in East Asia looking increasingly unlikely. But any kind of military conflict still appears far-fetched, and\u00a0neither nation appears poised to institute new tariffs on the other -- private businesses in both countries continue to work in the other, with American businesses like the NBA still reluctant to even  China's human rights abuses, let alone take any action or make any statements on the matter.For now, tit-for-tat sanctions appear to be as far as either country will go, with Trump this month signing the Hong Kong Autonomy Act, a bill to sanctions Chinese entities that have contributed to eroding the freedoms once enjoyed in Hong Kong and financial institutions that do business with them. The\u00a0executive branch also announced sanctions in relation to the oppression of the Uyghur Muslims.Meanwhile, China\u00a0sanctioned some U.S. individuals, including Republican Sens. Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio. Cruz, a close ally of the administration, echoed the rhetoric from Pompeo in his response.\"Unfortunately for CCP leaders, I don't have plans to travel to the authoritarian regime that covered up the coronavirus pandemic and endangered millions of lives worldwide,\" Cruz said in a statement that also condemned\u00a0the \"horrific forced abortions and sterilizations\" of the Uyghur Muslims.", "comment": "", "topic": "State Department", "date": " July 20"}, {"cover": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/03/156/88/AP20063397774832.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "title": "China takes aim at 4 US media companies, demanding staff, business info", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/world/china-us-media-companies-demanding-staff-business-info", "subtitle": "China has demanded information regarding staff and business operations from four major U.S. media outlets in retaliation to the U.S. government previously requesting similar information from China state owned media agencies.", "keyword": "China and Security", "website": "Fox News", "author": "Caitlin McFall", "content": " has demanded information regarding staff and business operations from four major U.S. media outlets in retaliation to the  previously requesting similar information from China state owned media agencies.The Associated Press, United Press International (UPI), CBS and National Public Radio (NPR) have seven days to file declarations regarding their staff, financial operations, real estate ownership and various other operations, according to Chinese Foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian Wednesday.Zhao pointed to the  designation of nine Chinese media outlets as \u201cforeign missions\u201d, alleging that they are mouthpieces for Beijing in late June, as justification for the announcement.\u201cIt should be pointed out that the above-mentioned measures by China are completely necessary countermeasures and are completely legitimate defenses compelled by unreasonable suppression of the U.S. side on Chinese media agencies in the United States,\u201d Zhao said at a daily briefing.The China Central Television, the China News Service, the People\u2019s Daily and the Global Times were designated as \u201cpropaganda outlets\u201d by the U.S. government.\u201cThis designation recognizes PRC [People\u2019s Republic of China] propaganda outlets as foreign missions and increases transparency relating to the CCP [Communist Party of China] and PRC \u00a0government\u2019s media activities in the United States,\u201d the State Department said in a  last month.The U.S. agency also said that the designation does not prevent or prohibit content that the media outlets are able to produce.But Zhao noted in a press conference Wednesday that the new U.S. policies affecting these media outlets has damaged their reputation and the image of Chinese media -- adding that the policies are reminiscent of \u201cCold War\u201d era stances and damage the freedom of the press.\u201cChina urges the U.S. to immediately change its course and correct its mistakes and stop the political suppression and unreasonable restrictions of the Chinese media,\u201d Zhao said.The Chinese media outlets are reportedly not being encouraged to leave the U.S., nor are there any limitations being placed on their production.

The act imposes sanctions on entities that help violate Hong Kong's autonomy and financial institutions that do business with them, and comes as a response to the passage of a \"national security\" law that tightened Beijing's grip on Hong Kong \u2014 which has been semi-autonomous from the mainland since 1997.The Chinese law, implemented earlier this summer, says that those who destroy government facilities and utilities would be considered subversive. Damaging public transportation facilities and arson would constitute acts of terrorism. Any person taking part in secessionist activities, whether organizing or participating, would violate the law regardless of whether violence is used.It comes after a full year of pro-democracy protests in the former British territory that was handed over to China 23 years ago on the condition that it would keep\u00a0a high degree of autonomy from mainland China and a British-style rule of law \u2014\u00a0a \"one country, two systems\" framework. China has slowly encroached on Hong Kong's autonomy, leading U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo early this year to declare that it is \"no longer autonomous.\"The new law prohibits what Beijing views as secessionist, subversive or terrorist activities or as foreign intervention in Hong Kong affairs and is seen as a direct response to the protest\u2019s calls for democracy. Under the law, police now have sweeping powers to conduct searches without warrants and order internet service providers and platforms to remove messages deemed to be in violation of the legislation.With Trump\u2019s executive order, exports from Hong Kong will be subject to the same tariffs the White House has imposed on goods from mainland China \u2013 marking a blow for leaders in Beijing as they struggle to revamp their economy amid the coronavirus pandemic and cutting off a lucrative loophole. The announcement from Trump also comes a day after the White House rejected nearly all of\u00a0\u2019s claims in the contested South China Sea.The administration presented the decision as an attempt to curb China\u2019s increasing assertiveness in the region with a commitment to recognizing international law. But it will almost certainly have the more immediate effect of further infuriating the Chinese, who are already retaliating against numerous U.S. sanctions and other penalties on other matters.Ties between China and the U.S. have deteriorated steadily over the coronavirus pandemic, human rights, Beijing policy toward Hong Kong and trade.

The election process and governance structure of organizations like the Human Rights Council make it easily susceptible to exploitation by China and other U.S. adversaries,\" Richard Goldberg, a senior advisor at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies (FDD) told Fox News. \"We need a proactive diplomatic campaign to delegitimize and degrade the organization while establishing credible, alternative mechanisms to hold human rights abusers accountable.\"According to Hillel Neuer, the executive director of the Geneva-based, independent human rights organization U.N.\u00a0, Khan \"enjoys close ties with the Communist regime\" and has \"showered praise for the Chinese regime\" and its Belt and Road Initiative, which is  one of the factors fueling the persecution of minorities like the Uighurs.In addition, Khan is said to have lauded China's \"contribution to global sustainable development\" through a $1 trillion infrastructure program tailored to increase its reach and ownership of strategic places and organizations in at least 70 countries.Khan \u2013 whose appointment as Special Rapporteur\u00a0will go into effect next month \u2013 served as Secretary-General of Amnesty International from 2001 to 2009, and left under unclear circumstances. Throughout her tenure, critics accused Khan of redirecting the human rights watchdog into fighting poverty and away from its original mandate centered on advocacy for prisoners of conscience. In 2011, she went on to become director-general of the Rome-based International Development Law Organization, which focuses on the rule of law and sustainable development, of which China is one of the eight state financiers.\"[Khan]\u00a0has a record of being a supporter of economic and social rights over political and civil liberties,\" noted Sean Roberts, director and associate professor of International Development Studies at the George Washington University. \"As such, it is likely that China is banking on the idea that she will continue this legacy at the U.N. and avoid highlighting freedom of speech issues related to the internal politics of any given country, including China.\"As chair of the five-nation Human Rights Council, which the U.S. withdrew from in 2018 at the behest of then-Ambassador Nikki Haley, China vetted and picked Khan out of 48 applicants to serve as the United Nations Special Rapporteur for freedom of expression and opinion, becoming the first woman to hold such a title.\"The Chinese government has been working hard to be a participant in as many of the U.N.'s initiatives as possible, both in terms of funding and engagement. At the same time, the United States is increasingly stepping back from the U.N., allowing China to take on an even greater role,\" Roberts underscored. \"And China's soft power globally, especially in the developing world, is on the rise at the same time as that of the U.S. is on the wane. Thus, China is able to get support from a lot of other U.N. member states to achieve its goals of more authority in the U.N.\"Roberts cautioned that while the U.N. \"has never been effective enough to live up to its lofty mission,\" it remains a dominant force in global politics.\"If the U.S. continues to retreat from its role in the organization and allows China to expand its power there, China's position as a global leader will inevitably be enhanced regardless of its respect for human rights,\" he said. \"Most of all, this threatens to deteriorate any power that the Universal Declaration of Human Rights still holds in the world.\"But Chinese leadership and control of international organizations extend well beyond the scope of the United Nations.The U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission (USCC) in April published an  identifying \"Chinese citizens serving in leadership positions in key international organizations: from U.N. principal organs, and U.N. funds and programs, to U.N. specialized agencies and international trade and financial institutions.All the while, concerns are being raised by the United States and other allies with regard\u00a0to the national security law that came into play inside the once autonomous  this month.The new law paves\u00a0the way for a national security committee to be formed in Hong Kong under the jurisdiction of Beijing, and it also means that those accused of anti-government offenses now can be tried\u00a0on the mainland and subject to significantly more stringent punishments.At the U.N. Human Rights Council, which was led this month by Cuba, 53 countries voted in support of China's heavy-handed clampdown with the justification that the people of Hong Kong could now \"exercise their freedom in a safe environment.\"Those who opposed the controversial law were considerably outnumbered, led by the U.K., but garnering the support of just 26 other countries.\"China is ascending in the U.N. because the U.N. provides an environment of corruption in which the Chinese Communist Party thrives. Consider that the , a part of the United Nations, praised the 'transparency' of the Chinese during the  when the Chinese government, in fact, censored and suppressed information,\" conjectured Will Coggin, managing director of the American Security Institute. \"Much as the U.S.  the WHO, we should consider whether it's worth continuing to spend $10 billion a year to fund the U.N. What does that money get us?\"Furthermore, Beijing's treatment and forced disappearance of more than a million Chinese minority Muslims, known as Uighurs, is also coming under increasingly blistering limelight.The U.S. has long spoken out against reports of mass concentration camps, unjustified allegations of terrorism and subsequent imprisonment\u00a0and torture of the minority group, which is mostly present in the Xinjiang region. And this week U.K. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab took a bold step in denouncing China for \"gross and egregious\" human rights abuses against its Uighur population and said sanctions against those responsible cannot be ruled out.Two years ago, as evidence of such camps was first exposed, China vehemently denied their existence. The government later admitted to their existence, vowing that they were \"reeducation\" institutions and a pivotal tool against terrorism.Nonetheless, even the United Nations' own independent human rights experts have conveyed outrage over the repression of \"fundamental freedom\" by the Chinese leadership as it continues to cement its place on the Council.In a joint  last month, some 50 experts bemoaned that they had \"repeatedly communicated\" their \"grave concerns,\" ranging from \"impunity for excessive use of force by police and the alleged use of chemical agents against protesters; to the alleged sexual harassment and assault of women protesters in police stations; together with the alleged harassment of health care workers\" in Hong Kong, along with the collective repression of specific communities \u2013 \"especially religious and ethnic minorities, in Xinjiang and Tibet\" \u2013 to the disappearances of human rights advocates across the country.The U.S. took matters into their own hands this week, imposing  on 11 additional\u00a0Chinese  over human rights violations against the Uighurs. The fallout will have a direct impact on several suppliers to major international brands such as Google, Apple, HP, Ralph Lauren\u00a0and Hugo Boss, which\u00a0have financial liaisons with the newly sanctioned companies.Whether there will be any change of course on China's part remains to be seen.", "comment": "", "topic": "UNITED NATIONS", "date": " July 22"}, {"cover": "https://a57.foxnews.com/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/694940094001/2bbe3e79-bb7f-4c92-9210-2516e1b5551a/7a83aa9f-ae32-43d5-ac0d-06f869b8a25c/1280x720/match/156/88/image.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "title": "Trump signs executive order to hold China accountable for actions against Hong Kong", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-signs-executive-order-to-hold-china-accountable-for-actions-against-hong-kong", "subtitle": "President Trump on Tuesday announced two actions his administration has taken against China as tensions between Washington and Beijing continue to rise.", "keyword": "China and Security", "website": "Fox News", "author": "Andrew O'Reilly", "content": " on Tuesday announced two actions his administration has taken against  as tensions between Washington and Beijing continue to rise.During a press conference in the White House Rose Garden, Trump announced that he had signed into law the Hong Kong Autonomy Act and also put his signature on an executive order that ends the United States\u2019 preferential treatment of Hong Kong. \"I signed legislation and an executive order to hold China accountable for its oppressive actions against the people of Hong Kong,\u201d Trump said. \u201cNo administration has been tougher on China than this administration.\u201dTrump\u2019s signature on the Hong Kong Accountability Act comes after the legislation was passed overwhelmingly in both the Senate and the House earlier this summer. The act imposes sanctions on entities that help violate Hong Kong's autonomy and financial institutions that do business with them, and comes as a response to the passage of a \"national security\" law that tightened Beijing's grip on Hong Kong \u2014 which has been semi-autonomous from the mainland since 1997.The Chinese law, implemented earlier this summer, says that those who destroy government facilities and utilities would be considered subversive. Damaging public transportation facilities and arson would constitute acts of terrorism. Any person taking part in secessionist activities, whether organizing or participating, would violate the law regardless of whether violence is used.It comes after a full year of pro-democracy protests in the former British territory that was handed over to China 23 years ago on the condition that it would keep\u00a0a high degree of autonomy from mainland China and a British-style rule of law \u2014\u00a0a \"one country, two systems\" framework. China has slowly encroached on Hong Kong's autonomy, leading U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo early this year to declare that it is \"no longer autonomous.\"The new law prohibits what Beijing views as secessionist, subversive or terrorist activities or as foreign intervention in Hong Kong affairs and is seen as a direct response to the protest\u2019s calls for democracy. Under the law, police now have sweeping powers to conduct searches without warrants and order internet service providers and platforms to remove messages deemed to be in violation of the legislation.With Trump\u2019s executive order, exports from Hong Kong will be subject to the same tariffs the White House has imposed on goods from mainland China \u2013 marking a blow for leaders in Beijing as they struggle to revamp their economy amid the coronavirus pandemic and cutting off a lucrative loophole. The announcement from Trump also comes a day after the White House rejected nearly all of\u00a0\u2019s claims in the contested South China Sea.The administration presented the decision as an attempt to curb China\u2019s increasing assertiveness in the region with a commitment to recognizing international law. But it will almost certainly have the more immediate effect of further infuriating the Chinese, who are already retaliating against numerous U.S. sanctions and other penalties on other matters.Ties between China and the U.S. have deteriorated steadily over the coronavirus pandemic, human rights, Beijing policy toward Hong Kong and trade. The Trump administration has also slapped visa bans on Chinese officials deemed responsible for barring foreigners\u2019 access to Tibet, along with those seen as enforcing a clampdown on civil rights in Hong Kong.Tensions ratcheted up in the last few days with the actions taken by both the U.S. and China.On Monday, China said\u00a0it will impose sanctions on three U.S. lawmakers and one ambassador in response to similar actions taken by the U.S. last week against Chinese officials over alleged human rights abuses against Muslims in the Xinjiang region.U.S. Senators Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz, Rep. Chris Smith and Ambassador for Religious Freedom Sam Brownback were targeted, as was the Congressional-Executive Commission on China. The four have been critical of the ruling Communist Party\u2019s policies toward minority groups and people of faith.Foreign ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying said the U.S. move had \u201cseriously damaged China-U.S. relations\u201d and that China was determined to uphold its national sovereignty against what it sees as interference in its internal affairs.\u201cChina will respond further according to the development of the situation,\u201d Hua said.", "comment": "(4,177)", "topic": "Donald Trump", "date": " July 14"}, {"cover": "https://a57.foxnews.com/media.foxbusiness.com/BrightCove/854081161001/202007/1212/156/88/854081161001_6175563863001_6175561719001-vs.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "title": "NGOs, activists press Barr to declare Chinese Communist Party a 'transnational criminal organization'", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/politics/hundreds-of-ngos-and-activists-pen-letter-to-ag-barr-requesting-chinese-communist-party-be-declared-a-transnational-criminal-organization", "subtitle": "Hundreds of U.S. and international religious and human rights groups and activists are calling for the U.S. Department of Justice\u00a0to declare the Chinese Communist Party a \u201ctransnational criminal organization,\"\u00a0or TCO.", "keyword": "China and Security", "website": "Fox News", "author": "Hollie McKay", "content": "Hundreds of U.S. and international religious and human rights groups and activists are calling for the U.S. \u00a0to declare the  Communist Party a \u201ctransnational criminal organization,\"\u00a0or TCO.The effort comes as\u00a0tensions between Washington and Beijing continue to flare,\u00a0compounded by the U.S. shuttering the Chinese consulate in Houston last week and\u00a0followed by the retaliatory measure of China closing the  in Chengdu.The  addressed to Attorney General William Barr and dated July 23 claims that the Chinese Communist Party (CCP)\u2019s \"lethality and criminal sophistication demonstrates that this lawless CCP poses a clear and present danger to the health, security, and prosperity of America.\u201dThe letter was\u00a0sponsored by the religious freedom outfit\u00a0Save the Persecuted Christians Coalition.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cThe CCP transnational criminal organization designation is clearly justified by the epidemic of American citizens victimized and killed by the Chinese manufactured and transmitted lethal synthetic drug, Fentanyl.

The extent and breadth of the criminal reach of the CCP knows no bounds.\u201dOne of  first moves after assuming the office in early 2017 was to sign the\u00a0 13773 entitled, \u201cEnforcing Federal Law With Respect to Transnational Criminal Organizations and Preventing International Trafficking.\u201d This, according to the letter, authorized by the executive branch \u201cto strengthen federal law enforcement\u00a0 to thwart  criminal organizations that present a threat to public safety and national security.\u201d\u201cIt is exceedingly evident that the list of transnational criminal organizations should include the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).\u00a0The pattern of the CCP  in the U.S. and around the world demonstrates a clear and present threat \u2018to public safety and national security,\"\u00a0the letter states.It cites an array of examples, ranging from the 2014 findings that the CCP hacked Anthem insurance, collecting sensitive information on 80 million Americans, to the 2017 data breach of Equifax in which the names, birthdates, social security numbers\u00a0and credit scores of 145 million Americans were harvested, to the 2019 break-in of the Marriott system, in which China\u2019s top brass was accused of stealing information on 383 million guests, including their passport numbers.\u201cOn July 7, 2020, FBI Director Christopher Wray raised the alarm about the threat posed by the Chinese Communist Party to the economic and national security of the United States,\" the letter asserts. \u201cAccording to Wray, the level of CCP criminality is so widespread and voluminous that, \u2018the FBI is opening a new China-related counterintelligence case about every 10 hours and of the nearly 5,000 active FBI counterintelligence cases currently underway across the country, almost half are related to China.\u2019\u201dIn conclusion, the letter contends that the CCP fits the characterization of a TOC as the \u201corganized criminal activity\u201d every day \u201cleaves Americans vulnerable to a widespread campaign of lawlessness, intimidation, and piracy by the CCP, which imperils our way of life.\u201dThe letter \u2013 penned by the likes of attorney Elizabeth Yore, founder of anti-child exploitation organization YoreChildren and Dede Laugesen, Executive Director of Save the Persecuted Christians \u2013 has additionally been signed by more than 500 individual activists and representatives from more than 70 non-governmental agencies and foundations in the realm of religious freedom, politics, and human rights.

U.S. has reported nearly 3.4 million cases to date and over 136,000 deaths according to  data.Diplomatic relations have further strained due to China\u2019s new security laws in Hong Kong, their refusal to sign a nuclear arms trade deal with the U.S. and Russia, as well as in the race to 5G -- in what the U.S. has said would be a massive security threat if China is the first to succeed in its

Virtually all photos and renderings of the J-31, since first unveiled, revealed a striking resemblance to the U.S. F-35. This does not come to the surprise of many in the U.S., given China\u2019s well-known and documented cyberespionage efforts. A 2014  Congressional report specifically cites a Defense Science Board finding that Chinese cyberattacks resulted in the theft of significant specs and technical details of a range of U.S. weapons systems\u2014including the F-35.At the same time, a 2018 Pentagon news story about DoD\u2019s annual China report mentions that apparent similarities between the F-35 and Chinese could very well be a result of espionage. A cursory look at the J-20 does appear to show some resemblance to the F-35, particularly the blended wing-body front end and internally built, conformal exhaust pipes. These similarities do appear, despite the apparent differences, as the J-20 has a wider and longer lower-body. However, available photos show an even larger measure of similarity between the F-35 and Chinese J-31 multi-role fighter.As recently as last year, another said the J-31 showed design improvements at the 2019 Paris Air Show. Photos from the story reveal profound visual similarities between the F-35 and J-31. This is not without precedent, as the Chinese media itself has noted similarities between the two aircraft. Portions of a story from the Chinese government\u2019s \u201c as far back as 2013 specifically cites design similarity between the emerging Chinese J-31 and the F-35, writing that the \u201cJ-31 and F-35 use the same DSI inlet (non-boundary layer-separated lane supersonic inlet).\u201d The only major difference, the paper notes, is that the U.S. has an F-35B Short Take Off and Landing variant and that the J-31 uses two engines compared to the F-35\u2019s single-engine propulsion configuration.The article\u2019s reference to a \u201cnon-boundary layer separated lane supersonic inlet\u201d appears both interesting and significant, as it pertains to designs engineered to manage heat and air movement signatures demonstrated by the aerodynamic phenomenon of airflow surrounding supersonic flight. \u201cBoundary layer\u201d aerodynamics, referring to the airflow surrounding a weapon or platform as it transits, can greatly impact the flight stability and stealth characteristics of an aircraft.A pertinent comparison can be found in the Air Force Research Laboratories\u2019 current work on \u201cboundary layer phenomenology\u201d related to next-generation hypersonic weapons. Senior Air Force science and technology leaders and weapons developers told me at the Air Force Association symposium in 2019 that \u201cboundary layer phenomenology\u201d was figuring prominently in ongoing research and development regarding future weapons and platforms. Managing heat flow and temperature is, of course, vital to maintaining flight stability for hypersonic weapons traveling at speeds up to five-times the speed of sound. Developers seek to engineer configurations that will generate a \u201claminar\u201d or smooth airflow as opposed to \u201cturbulent\u201d boundary layer to enable a weapon to sustain an accurate trajectory and manage excessive heat.Therefore, by extension, it seems apparent the same aerodynamic principles apply to stealth aircraft configurations that seek to manage the heat signatures and turbulence potentially generated in the airflow boundary layers of stealth jets flying at supersonic speeds. Accordingly, a \u201cnon-boundary layer separated lane\u201d for airflow, (as cited by the article) which does not break up or radically change airflow trajectory, could not only ensure smoother flight at high speeds but also help manage temperature. Of course, there would be significant differences between the thermal management technical engineering needed for hypersonics and stealth aircraft, yet smoother wing-body melded external designs, absent hard or protruding edges, clearly bring the added advantage of a smoother and cooler air flow boundary layer. Along these lines, the 2019 Global Times report details a few design changes to the 2019 J-31 which, according to the photographs, show a smoother, less-jagged exterior behind the cockpit compared to earlier models.The Chinese newspaper stops short of exploring a fully-detailed discussion of aerodynamic designs related to the aircraft, but does cite a Chinese Air Force test pilot expert as saying \u201cthe J-31\u2019s stealth aerodynamic design, stealth engine design and stealth coating design have all reached internationally advanced standards in stealth technology.\u201d (China\u2019s Air Force test pilot expert Xu Yongling.However, external configuration and some elements of visible heat-signature management represent merely a few of many characteristics when it comes to stealth technology; stealth designs also often incorporate internally-built engines, radar-absorbent coating materials and internal weapons bays, among other things. Along these lines, the People\u2019s Daily Online report makes the claim that the J-31 has a superior weapons payload capability compared with the F-35. However, available specs report that the J-31 travels with six external weapons hardpoints\u2026 the same number as the F-35.As for how the J-31 may be employed, Chinese and U.S. newspapers are filled with various kinds of speculation; some reports say the fighter is intended for export as a way to counter the reach and scope of the F-35, however other reports cite Chinese officials saying the J-31 is intended for domestic use and possibly could even fly off of Chinese aircraft carriers.Chinese progress with the J-31 calls to mind several timely strategic calculations. A more recent Congressional report, the , makes specific reference to concern regarding China\u2019s expansionist aims when it comes to projecting air, land and sea power. The text of the review points to dramatic upticks in \u201clong-distance over-water training\u201d exercises over new areas in recent years which, the study goes on to suggest, improves the PLA Air Force\u2019s capability to gather intelligence and \u201cexecute maritime missions against the U.S.\u201d\u201cIn November and December 2017, China\u2019s People\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA) Air Force conducted at least nine long-distance training flights over maritime areas along China\u2019s periphery, continuing a trend that began in 2015,\u201d stated the .All of this pertains to the often and widely discussed recognition that China has long-since passed its ambitions to operate as a dominant regional power and migrated aggressively toward positioning itself as a massive, ", "comment": "(527)", "topic": "US Air Force", "date": " July 15"}, {"cover": "https://a57.foxnews.com/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/694940094001/08b970e1-a9de-4a5e-923a-807a947ea6e7/c0d201e4-6b12-4ce8-8322-be55d5cd9f6a/1280x720/match/156/88/image.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "title": "Sen.

Typically, consulates carry out services such as issuing visas and engaging in cultural exchanges. But the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) outpost in  was far from a typical consulate.Instead, the consulate served as a front for the CCP and a central node in the massive spying operation that  uses to undermine the United States. This network carries out all sorts of espionage \u2014 political, defensive, industrial, academic, and commercial \u2014 to try to gain a strategic edge over the U.S. by cheating and stealing.America\u2019s adversaries, including China and Russia, use their consulates to conduct all sorts of nefarious activities. For the CCP, the Houston consulate served as a base of operations to exploit commercial joint ventures for state purposes and to gain access to advanced technology, proprietary information, and intellectual property in order to advance Beijing\u2019s efforts to undermine U.S. economic and national security.Critically, the Houston consulate covered China's activities in seven states, including my home state of Florida.The Chinese diplomats had been involved in stealing scientific research, as well as facilitating travel to China using falsified paperwork. The consulate also had used CCP-controlled community groups to cultivate Texas elites. And considering this occurred in Houston, the malign Chinese activity likely involved theft and espionage connected to the U.S. energy and health care sectors.The Trump administration\u2019s decision to shut the consulate down is exactly right and sends a strong message to China, Russia and other adversaries that this illegal espionage will no longer be tolerated.This isn\u2019t the first time the Trump administration has had to deal with this sort of behavior. Just last December, it was forced to expel two Chinese Embassy officials on suspicions of espionage, after they were caught attempting to access a sensitive military installation in Virginia.We cannot simply ignore the prolific increase of Chinese espionage and political influence operations, especially on American soil. Sometimes a hammer is required to send a message.As the consular staff members pack their bags, we must also remember that the Houston consulate was a cog in a much larger system of exploitation.The CCP is seemingly unable to conduct international relations without spying, especially on the people the party claims as its own, such as Chinese-Americans \u2014 wherever they are and in every facet of their lives.Chinese espionage and data collection are evident all throughout their diplomatic corps \u2014\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 from excessive visa application requirements on Chinese Americans, to exerting control over Chinese community organizations, to pushing co-opted Chinese students toward sensitive research areas.Chinese surveillance and influence operations can be pointed to different ends. Some influence agents are tasked with swaying members of Congress as well as state and local politicians under the auspices of diplomatic relations. Others steal commercial secrets from defense contractors or in important sectors like advanced manufacturing.The United States has tried to work productively with China to reduce these tactics and mend relations.For example, in 2015, both of our governments agreed to stop using their intelligence services to steal technology for commercial gain. That agreement lasted just weeks, and the Trump administration made clear to Beijing that Americans would not allow China\u2019s underhanded treachery by indicting three Chinese government-affiliated hackers for stealing economic secrets in 2017.The message went unheeded. China\u2019s exploitation of American companies continued relentlessly. Just this week, the Justice Department accused two Chinese hackers working for Beijing's spy service of trying to steal information pertaining to the creation of a COVID-19 vaccine.By closing the Houston consulate, the United States signaled the status quo between the United States and China is unacceptable.In the meantime, I will soon be introducing legislation to ban Chinese firms from American capital markets if those companies are found to have engaged in espionage or human rights abuses, or otherwise exist to bolster Beijing\u2019s military.It is in everyone\u2019s interest for the United States and China to enjoy a balanced relationship in the 21st century.

The agreement, made in accordance with\u00a0the 1987 Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty, limited the number of deployed nuclear warheads to no more than 1,550 along with 700 missiles and bombers.Both the U.S. and Russia pulled out of the original 1987 nuclear arms agreement last year, leaving the New START treaty as the last line of defense against nuclear proliferation between the world\u2019s  in nuclear development.If the treaty expired it would be the  the U.S. and Russia were not united in a nuclear arms treaty since the Cold War. \u201cWe only need the extension as much as the Americans do,\u201d Lavrov said during a conference call with foreign policy experts Friday. \u201cIf they categorically refuse, we will not try to persuade them.\u201dRussia has said they would extend the treaty, which is set to expire Feb. 2021, without any additional provisions. But the Trump administration is now pushing for a new agreement that would include China.Russia security officials are claiming this new agreement is unrealistic, and point to China\u2019s repeated refusals to negotiate an arms deal that requires they reduce their number of nuclear arms.The U.S. and Russia account for more than 90 percent of the world\u2019s nuclear arms, according to .China has said they are committed to a no first-use policy -- a nuclear deterance strategy that means China won\u2019t strike first. However, China is working to increase its nuclear forces and has reportedly expanded its response capabilities, as reported by Defense News.Lavrov rejected the U.S.\u2019s calls to have Russia negotiate with China on reducing its nuclear arms arsenal, calling it \u201cundiplomatic\u201d. He said that they would be happy to discuss nuclear arms reductions with any country whether it\u2019s Britain, France or China but said it needs to be that country\u2019s decision.\u201cI\u2019m not particularly optimistic about the New START in view of the course taken by U.S. negotiators,\u201d Lavrov said.Lavrov said that the administration\u2019s new stance on nuclear arms is making it more unlikely an agreement can be reached, adding \u201cwe are absolutely confident that we can guarantee our security for a long perspective, even in the absence of this treaty.\u201dThe U.S\u2019s new contingency comes amid increasingly strained tensions between the U.S. and China \u2013 Lavrov note that the feud could hurt the global economy.But when asked if Russia could assist in brokering their relationship Lavrov said \u201cIf they ask us, if they show such interest, we won\u2019t refuse to do so.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ve established contact with both parties,\u201d Lavrov said. \u201cWe are always ready to try to help, but, of course, we won\u2019t push our services on anyone.\u201dRussia is now debating pulling out of the Open Skies Treaty, which allows for observation flights over military facilities, after Trump announced in May the U.S. may be pulling out of the 2002 agreement.\u201cWe will make a final decision on whether to stay in it after we weigh all the consequences of the U.S. withdrawal,\u201d Lavrov said.The European Union has urged the U.S. to reconsider.The Department of State could not be reached to answer whether or not the U.S. would allow the nuclear arms treaty with Russia to expire if China refuses to sign the new agreement.", "comment": "(181)", "topic": "Russia", "date": " July 10"}, {"cover": "https://a57.foxnews.com/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/694940094001/2fb267e4-608f-44f0-980a-a513b877efd2/59137740-f451-48aa-805d-b208ab28196d/1280x720/match/156/88/image.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "title": "Trump administration adds 11 companies to sanctions list over Uighur oppression, including suppliers for US firms", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-administration-adds-11-companies-to-sanctions-list-over-uighur-oppression", "subtitle": "The sanctions represent another step by the administration as it's heightened pressure on the Chinese government in recent months.", "keyword": "China and Security", "website": "Fox News", "author": "Tyler Olson", "content": "The  administration on Monday slapped  on 11  firms over their use of forced labor and other forms of repression against the Uighur Muslims, an ethnic minority in China, including some with documented relationships with American companies.The sanctions represent another step by the administration in its heightened pressure on the Chinese government in recent months.The Commerce Department announced that those firms would be put on the \"Entity List,\" an index of companies that are believed to be engaged in\u00a0\"activities contrary to the national security or foreign policy interests of the United States.\" According to the Commerce Department, these activities are not just limited to forced labor, but also include DNA collection.\"Beijing\u00a0actively promotes the reprehensible practice of forced labor and abusive DNA collection and analysis schemes to repress its citizens,\" Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross  in a statement. \u201cThis action will ensure that our goods and technologies are not used in the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s despicable offensive against defenseless Muslim minority populations.\"A  from this March by the , which is run by the Australian government, named a number of companies now placed on the Entity List.

But\u00a0he's often praised Chinese President Xi Jinping himself.Meanwhile, the U.S. has maintained a consistent message against China's claims in the South China Sea during the Trump administration, regularly executing freedom of navigation operations with U.S. Navy vessels. But Trump himself roiled Republicans last fall when he congratulated Xi on his country's 70th anniversary, refraining from any criticism of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).Trump himself, according to a book by former National Security Adviser John Bolton, had previously expressed a lack of interest in standing up to China on the Uighur issue -- Trump and many in his administration have condemned Bolton and his book. Yet the administration has worked furiously to freeze out Huawei, a Chinese-controlled tech company, from global 5G networks.Nevertheless, the Trump administration is now ratcheting up the pressure on China on a variety of fronts, including on the oppression of the Uighurs and the alleged cover-up of the coronavirus earlier this year.

Development Program (UNDP), was announced  as the co-chair of WHO\u2019s Independent Panel for Pandemic Preparedness and Response (IPPR) along with\u00a0former President of Liberia Ellen Johnson Sirleaf.\u00a0Clark was tipped as a top contender for the role of U.N. Secretary-General in 2016.But in an interview in April with , she criticized the U.S. decision to leave the body, a move made over concerns WHO was too close to Beijing,\u00a0as \"foolish.\"\u201cTo withdraw funding from the World Health Organization in the middle of a pandemic is clearly foolish,\" she said in an interview, flagged by journalist Sara Carter.\u00a0\"About 15 percent of the WHO's\u00a0budget comes from the United States of America\u00a0and actually the biggest share of that funding goes to very important programs, like the eradication of polio.\"She also appeared to knock the U.S. for its demand that a  on the virus explicitly include a mention of the Chinese origins of the virus.\"If you, as\u00a0a major country with\u00a0a veto power on the Security Council,\u00a0enter the room with the attitude that you are determined to have in the resolution\u00a0a name for\u00a0the virus which\u00a0is not the scientific name but the name of the place where the virus came from, then you know you\u00a0don't really want a resolution, you're just entering a blame game.\"This week, in an interview with , she said it was \"very distressing\" that the U.S. had left, and said she hoped that the U.S. would reenter the organization.\"I don't think these decisions are forever, and I very much hope we'll see the U.S. back in there, playing the role that it's traditionally played,\" she said.Clark has raised concerns from U.N. critics over past comments she has made in relation to the virus. In March, she tweeted about Cuba\u2019s response:\"#Cuba is known globally for its willingness to send health professional teams to the most challenging emergencies. Full marks to it for sending personnel to #Covid_19 - stricken #Italy\u201dFor that, she attracted the ire of U.N.\u00a0Watch, a Geneva-based watchdog: \u201cHelen Clark has an attraction to Communist dictatorships. Here she is showering praise on Cuba's Communist regime for sending doctors abroad.\u201dIt\u2019s also accused her of being \u00a0as well as WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. But in remarks in May, Clark was critical of the\u00a0Chinese response and said it took seven days after Chinese officials determined the virus was a \u201chuge threat\u201d to warn their\u00a0people.\u201cIn that seven days, millions began traveling for the Lunar New Year and in Wuhan...there were thousands of people at mass events, so this is pretty disturbing,\" she said on .\u201cIf you want to be a great power that is respected, and fear doesn\u2019t bring respect, then you have to be upfront\u00a0as utterly transparent with the international community,\" she said.She also expressed concern about countries allowing Huawei access to their systems, saying it appeared to be approved on cost, rather than for security reasons. But she also stood by her decision as prime minister to make New Zealand the first country to sign a free trade deal with China.\u201cTo those who criticize efforts to bring China into the international\u00a0rules-based trading order, I would ask, well what\u2019s the alternative?\" she asked. \"To have them operating out there outside the multilateral rules framework? That\u2019s really unthinkable.\u201d that it would withdraw\u00a0from the World Health Organization over the WHO's\u00a0handling of the coronavirus pandemic. President Trump has\u00a0cited WHO officials' praise of Chinese \"transparency,\" its dismissal of warnings about the virus from Taiwan, and its repetition of Chinese claims that COVID-19 could not be spread from person-to-person. Trump has also pointed to opposition from WHO officials to his decision to place a travel ban on China in the initial days of the crisis.\"Chinese officials ignored their reporting obligations to the World Health Organization and pressured the World Health Organization to mislead the world when the virus was first discovered by Chinese authorities,\" he said, announcing the move. \"Countless lives have been taken and profound economic hardship has been inflicted across the globe.\"On Wednesday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo indicated that he was not hopeful for the upcoming investigation, particularly given the Chinese government's lack of transparency in the past.\u201cThis is a regime that failed to disclose information they had about a virus that\u2019s now killed over 100,000 Americans, hundreds of thousands across the world, cost the global economy trillions and trillions of dollars, and now is allowing the World Health Organization to go in to conduct what I am confident will be a completely, completely whitewashed investigation,\u201d he said.", "comment": "", "topic": "World Health Organization", "date": " July 16"}, {"cover": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/05/156/88/Trump-AP-Pompeo-Getty.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "title": "Helen Raleigh: Trump admin on China\u2019s human rights abuses \u2014 tough stance deserves credit", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/trump-administration-chinas-human-rights-abuses-helen-raleigh", "subtitle": "Many Americans are not aware of what the Trump administration has done to address human rights issues in China.", "keyword": "China and Security", "website": "Fox News", "author": "", "content": "The  administration imposed sanctions on several senior officials of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), accusing them of playing key roles in human rights abuses against Uyghur Muslims and other religious minorities in\u00a0Xinjiang region, China. These officials and their immediate families will be barred from entering the U.S. and any of their international assets will be frozen.What makes this announcement even more significant is that the most senior official on this latest sanction list is Chen Quanguo, a member of CCP's elite 25-member Politburo, which is the most powerful political body in  and counts CCP's General Secretary Xi Jinping as its most senior member. No previous U.S. administrations had ever imposed sanctions on any CCP official at this senior level. This announcement came one week after the Associated Press reported that the CCP has imposed draconian birth control measures in order to limit Muslim population growth.Early\u00a0this year, President Trump\u00a0signed the\u00a0Uyghur  Policy Act of 2020, which gives him authority to impose sanctions against individuals in China involved in human rights violations against Uyghur and other ethnic groups in Xinjiang. Besides punishing CCP officials, the Trump administration also warned\u00a0recently that it would crack down on U.S. businesses, organizations and individuals who either contributed to human rights abuses or benefited from forced labor in Xinjiang or elsewhere in China.Secretary of State Mike Pompeo made it clear that \u201cthe United States will not stand idly by as the Chinese Communist party carries out human rights abuses targeting Uighurs, ethnic Kazakhs and members of other minority groups in Xinjiang, to include forced labor, arbitrary mass detention, and forced population control, and attempts to erase their culture and Muslim faith.\u201d\u00a0 The Trump administration certainly backed up its words with actions.The rest of the world has been aware of the CCP's human rights abuses in Xinjiang since 2016, yet other than paying lip service, no other government nor the United Nation's Human Rights Council has taken any meaningful steps to address such abuses like the Trump administration has done. The Trump administration's latest sanctions also came only one day after the administration issued visa bans against CCP officials who are responsible for barring foreigners' access to Tibet.Since President Trump signed the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act last year, Secretary Pompeo indicated that more sanctions are coming against Chinese officials who are responsible for enforcing Beijing's new national security law, which has already effectively curbed Hong Kong's autonomy and Hong Kongers' long-cherished political freedom since it came into effect at midnight of June 30.The Trump administration's one-two punch on China's human rights issues is unprecedented and it has done more to address China's human rights issues than all previous administrations, including those run by Republican presidents.For example, after Beijing brutally cracked down on peaceful pro-democracy protests in Tiananmen Square in 1989, President George H.W. Bush initially condemned Beijing's actions and temporarily suspended some arms sales to China.\u00a0 However, rather than taking a strong stand, he quickly announced \"now is the time to look beyond the moment to important and enduring aspects of this vital relationship for the United States.\"The Bush administration's willingness to continue to do business with Beijing while overlooking bloodstains on the streets only strengthened the CCP's cynicism that Western democracies are nothing but a greedy bunch who are always keen on trading professed values for money. The CCP often quotes Vladimir Lenin's words, \"The Capitalists will sell us the rope with which we will hang them\" to show their contempt for western democracies.Minxin Pei, a professor of government at Claremont McKenna College wrote recently that \"such cynicism now permeates China\u2019s strategy of asserting full control over Hong Kong. Chinese leaders expect the West\u2019s anger at their actions to fade quickly, calculating that Western firms are too heavily invested in the city to let the perils of China\u2019s police state be a deal-breaker.\"From President George H. W. Bush to President Barack Obama, every administration had proved that the CCP's cynicism was right. However, Pei continued, \"in Trump and his national-security hawks, China has finally met its match... no CCP leader ever imagined that the US government would be willing to write off the Chinese market in pursuit of broader geopolitical objectives,\" including taking a strong stand for human rights issues in China.One person in the Trump administration who stands out and who has been consistently and relentlessly advocating for human rights issues in China is Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo. When he speaks about China, he always makes the distinction between the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people.He consistently emphasizes that his criticism of the CCP is not to create confrontation but out of the hope that the CCP will \"respect basic human rights of its own people\" and \"the genius of its people to flourish.\" He mentions human rights in every speech on China and he has been quickly and openly condemned Beijing's human rights abuses either through issuing statements or social media posts, time and again.More importantly, Secretary Pompeo always backs up his words with actions. Last year, he met with Hong Kong pro-democracy leader Martin Lee and the publisher of Apple Daily, Jimmy Lai, both of whom were arrested by Hong Kong police early this year for their support and participation of what Hong Kong authorities deemed \u201cunlawful protests\u201d from August to September 2019.On May 27, 2020, less than a week after Beijing announced it intended to impose a new national security law on Hong Kong, Secretary Pompeo\u00a0provided his certification\u00a0to Congress, stating \u201cHong Kong is no longer autonomous from China.\u201dHis certification, which is required under the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, enables the Trump administration to identify proper response to Beijing's breach of an international treaty it signed with Great Britain in 1984, which was supposed to guarantee Hong Kong's semi-autonomy status for 50 years.Then on the eve of the 31st year anniversary of the 1989 Tiananmen Square Massacre, Secretary Pompeo met former student leaders and survivors.\u00a0 His words and actions advocating for human rights in China earned him vicious attacks from China's state-owned media which called him a \"common enemy of mankind.\u201d\u00a0 They should have known that no amount of name-calling will silence Secretary Pompeo.Many Americans are not aware of what the Trump administration has done to address human rights issues in China because mainstream liberal media would much rather spend their energy and time attacking the administration than actually reporting on the administration's accomplishments. No doubt the CCP is delighted to have Americans\u2019 liberal media outlets doing its bidding, free of charge.It's time American people give the Trump administration credit where credit is due, for its global leadership and all the remarkable actions it has taken to hold the CCP accountable for human rights abuses in China.", "comment": "(133)", "topic": "OPINION", "date": " July 13"}, {"cover": "https://a57.foxnews.com/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/694940094001/08b970e1-a9de-4a5e-923a-807a947ea6e7/c0d201e4-6b12-4ce8-8322-be55d5cd9f6a/1280x720/match/156/88/image.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "title": "James Carafano: China's sanctions on US officials are an attempt to scare the world", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/chinas-sanctions-on-us-officials-james-carafano", "subtitle": "China's action is intended to send the world a message: Fear us.", "keyword": "China and Security", "website": "Fox News", "author": "", "content": "On Monday, the  Communist Government slapped sanctions on members of Congress as well as a U.S. ambassador. This action is intended to send the world a message: Fear us.The free  response should be to man up.Beijing\u2019s action came after recent U.S. legislation calling for sanctions on Chinese officials over their systematic abuse of the Uighurs and other Muslim minorities. We\u2019re talking about systematic and horrific  violations, including the mass detention of over a million Chinese citizens, religious persecution, exploitation of slave labor and forced sterilization.Last week, these inhumane practices led the Trump administration to impose sanctions on four individuals, including Politburo member Chen Quanguo, the highest-ranking Chinese official ever called out by Washington. Chen is also Party secretary of Xinjiang Province, where the Uighur detention camps are located.\u00a0The other three officials sanctioned are also tied to Xinjiang.China announced its \u201c\u201d on Monday. Three of those targeted are Sens. Ted Cruz,\u00a0R-Texas,\u00a0and Marco Rubio,\u00a0R-Fla.,\u00a0and Rep. Chris Smith,\u00a0R-N.J., who led the legislative efforts to punish Beijing. Also named by Beijing were U.S. Ambassador for International Religious Freedom Sam Brownback and members of the Congressional-Executive Commission on China.This is not just Beijing playing tit-for-tat with Washington. The Chinese action comes on the heels of  that significantly restricts the economic and political freedoms long enjoyed by the people of Hong Kong. The Chinese regime has also engaged in an aggressive diplomatic and propaganda effort during the COVID-19 crisis, evading responsibilities for its own failures, while threatening other nations for not siding with China.The highly hostile approach now being pursued by Beijing is popularly called \u201cwolf warrior\u201d diplomacy. The moniker refers to a series of Chinese films in which a Rambo-like character runs around the world thwarting \u201cevil\u201d capitalist designs.The real question is whether wolf warrior diplomacy is an act of strength or weakness. After all, the Soviet Union unveiled their Rambo-esque character in a film which premiered less than four years before the evil empire collapsed.But no matter whether it driven by insecurity or overconfidence, China\u2019s increasingly intimidating stance is a problem the United States will have to deal with.America\u2019s response ought to focus on the target for Beijing\u2019s temper tantrum \u2014 and it is probably not America. In practice, China has had no luck bullying this administration. From increasing freedom of navigation operations in the South China Seas to upping support for Taiwan, action on trade and calling out Beijing\u2019s abuse of the World Health Organization, when Beijing has pushed, the U.S. has pushed back harder.America can get away with bumping heads with Beijing. We are a superpower.China\u2019s sanctions aren\u2019t so much designed to push against an immovable geo-political object as they are trying to flow around U.S. power and intimidate others. There is little likelihood, they\u2019ll ever try to extradite Cruz or Rubio.\u00a0No, they want to send a message to others.Kicking sand in the face of American officials is the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s not-so-subtle warning that they are willing to go after anyone who gets in their way \u2014 and the weaker and meeker their opponents are, the harder China will squeeze.When it comes to battling wolf warrior diplomacy, the free world has to stand together. Otherwise China will use its divide-and-overwhelm strategy to pick the free world apart.Standing together will require American leadership, and it deserves strong, bipartisan support here at home. This is an issue where contemporary Washington politics of \u201cif Trump is for it, we are against it\u201d must be put aside. If we can\u2019t pull together on this one, we can\u2019t lead.Next, we are going to have to tell our friends and allies the hard truth: a country that wants to be part of the free world must stand with the free world in pushing back China\u2019s destabilizing actions that undermine our security, prosperity and values. They are going to have to carry their fair share of the load.Finally, we have to make the free world stronger. The tougher we are to take out, the more likely China is to back down. We have to recommit to collective defense. We have to partner in jumpstarting our economies so we can recover faster and stronger after the COVID-19 crisis.

But immediately, suspicions were raised that the data was being used to ascertain who had the healthiest organs for \"donation.\"\"This selection was purely racial: over half of the population of Xinjiang, the Han Chinese, were exempt from the medical tests,\" Gutmann said.In a testimony provided to Fox News via the London-based World Uyghur Congress, Uighur gulag survivor Omer Bakari said he underwent his first round of forced blood and urine sample, along with an eye and full-body exam, at a Pichan police station in late March 2017. He said the following month\u00a0he was made to undergo a second exam at a hospital before \"being thrown\" into a Karmay prison where he was beaten with a whip and surrounded by others in the community who were left \"hanging like meat\" in cells. He suspects he was being tested as a potential candidate to be organ-plucked.Similarly, Gulbahar Jelilova, 46, stated that she was seized by Chinese authorities in May 2017 after traveling to Urumqi, the capital of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, to pick up a shipment of goods for her exporting business.She alleged that she was then coerced into making a false confession that she had transferred money to a Turkish company she had never even heard of, and pledged that throughout her 15-month incarceration the women were all given tablets that stopped their menstrual cycle, and that she\u00a0at one point early on was stripped naked for a medical examination.Canadian human rights lawyer David Matas, who has extensively studied the illicit organ harvesting issue, highlighted that at Kashgar airport in Xinjiang, there are even signs in various languages signifying the route for transporting organs to the aircraft for exportation abroad. Photographs  in September 2018 show \"priority lanes\" for this very purpose.Adding to the obscurity surrounding the possible targeting of the Uighur Muslims is the emergence of reports indicating that many who go to China for life-saving organs come from the wealthy Gulf States; thus the demand for \"halal\" organs \u2013 from bodies untouched by dietary choices such as pork and from those who have followed a diet in keeping with the tenants of Islam \u2013 are in demand.Gutmann asserted that while there are no known advertisements for \"halal organs,\" the phrase has become a useful shorthand for several pieces of evidence,\" which includes documentation of \"gulf state organ\u00a0tourists in Tianjin Central Hospital, the worlds largest transplant center.\"\"Go back a few years, and the foreign entrance to the hospital website politely asked if you preferred to continue in English or Arabic,\" he continued. \"More recently, at least one Chinese hospital openly advertises to the world that it has a very nice\u00a0Muslim prayer room and a halal restaurant.\"While experts say the most significant market is domestic, organ shoppers hail from\u00a0far and wide.\"The biggest customers are wealthy or politically connected local Chinese,\" Matas said. \"The biggest foreign customers are now Japanese, South Koreans, and Saudis.\"Salih Hudayar, prime minister of the East Turkistan Government in Exile, pointed out that \"Uighur prisoners have also been transferred to Heilongjiang Province near the Korean border; it is known that Korea is a big market for organs.\"But getting to the bottom of the matter is profoundly challenging for outside investigators, given the widespread suppression in Xianjing.More than one million Uighurs are estimated to be \"disappeared\" into concentration camps \u2013 what Beijing refers to as \"re-education camps\" and a necessary national security tool against Islamic extremism. Moreover, victims'\u00a0bodies are quickly disposed of \u2013 family members are typically told that their otherwise healthy loved one died suddenly and are under close supervision by authorities when they view and bury the body.Nonetheless, China has repeatedly denied the use of unethical organ transplant practices, maintaining that it stopped using the organs from executed prisoners in 2015.Officials have accused the China Tribunal of perpetuating \"rumors.\"Yet a probe published in the  journal in November accused China of \"systematic falsification and manipulation of official organ transplant datasets\" to obscure just how few voluntary donors had registered, compared to how many transplant surgeries occurred.Sometimes referred to as \"medical genocide\" by activists, the fast and furious transplant trade is estimated to make some $1 billion a year for the Beijing back pocket.\"One or two of China's hospitals could have matched the average of about 6,000 liver transplants performed annually in the entire United States since 2000,\" stated the U.S.-based , which claims to have combed through hundreds of transplant hospitals in China and their revenue, bed counts, bed utilization rates, surgical expertise, training programs, state funding and more, for its findings. \"While Chinese officials claim that the country performs about 10,000 transplants a year, this annual figure is easily surpassed by just a few hospitals. Based on government-imposed minimum capacity requirements, the 164 approved transplant hospitals could have conducted more than 70,000 transplants per year.\"Chinese medical authorities boast that the country performs the most transplants in the world \u2013 surpassing the 40,000 that happen annually in the U.S. \u2013 but the circumstance of its \"voluntary\" nature remains murky.\"Most Chinese are reluctant to donate their organs given their traditions, so we believe that forced organ harvesting is still continuing. We highly suspect that it is happening in East Turkistan due to the fact that many of the bodies of victims who died in the concentration camps and prisons haven't been returned to their families,\" noted Hudayar. \"In the instances that the bodies were returned their families, there were visible stitches on parts of the bodies like the kidneys.\"He also emphasized that thousands of Uighurs \"were secretly transferred to prisons inside Chinese provinces like Henan,\u00a0where there are five known Chinese hospitals\u00a0that have been implicated by researchers for being involved in organ harvesting.\"\"Given its record on religious freedom, we have no reason to trust Communist China's denials,\" contended Gary Bauer, commissioner for the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF). \"The government's lack of transparency is in itself very revealing.\u00a0Unfortunately, most victims of this outrageous practice die as a result, so they are not able to speak about their suffering.\"But despite grave concerns being voiced by the international community as it pertains to possible organ harvesting and the Uighurs, no country nor international agency is yet to actually take on a formal investigation and prosecutorial process.The U.S. State Department and the Chinese Embassy in Washington did not respond to further requests from Fox News for comment.", "comment": "", "topic": "China", "date": " July 28"}, {"cover": "https://a57.foxnews.com/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/694940094001/08b970e1-a9de-4a5e-923a-807a947ea6e7/c0d201e4-6b12-4ce8-8322-be55d5cd9f6a/1280x720/match/156/88/image.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "title": "China retaliates, closes Chengdu consulate", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/world/china-retaliates-closes-chengdu-consulate", "subtitle": "The U.S. has four other consulates in China and an embassy in Beijing", "keyword": "China and Security", "website": "Fox News", "author": "", "content": "CHENGDU, China -- The U.S. closed its consulate in the southwestern city of Chengdu on Monday, a victim of the rising China ordered the mission closed late last week in retaliation for a U.S. order to shut down the Chinese Consulate in Houston earlier the same week.The tit-for-tat closings marked a significant escalation in the multiple disputes between the two countries over a range of issues, including trade, technology, security and human rights.A statement from the State Department said that the Chengdu consulate suspended operations at 10 a.m.\"The consulate has stood at the center of our relations with the people in Western China, including Tibet, for 35 years,\" the statement said. \"We are disappointed by the Chinese Communist Party's decision and will strive to continue our outreach to the people in this important region through our other posts in China.\"The U.S. has four other consulates in China and an embassy in Beijing.The American flag was taken down at the Chengdu mission at 6:18 a.m., China's state broadcaster CCTV said on its social media account.Police closed off a two- to three-block area around the consulate, cutting off virtually any view of the property including the flag. A few vehicles were allowed through after police checks, and others could be seen moving in the distance.Moving trucks arrived at the U.S. consulate the previous day and left a few hours later. Late Sunday night, flatbed trailers entered the complex. One later emerged carrying a large shipping container and a crane.Before the area was closed, the impending closure of the consulate drew a steady stream of onlookers over the weekend as Chengdu, like Houston, found itself in the limelight of international politics.People stopped to take selfies and photos, jamming a sidewalk busy with shoppers and families with strollers on a sunny day in the city of Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan province. A little boy posed with a small Chinese flag before plainclothes police shooed him away as foreign media cameras zoomed in.Police had shut the street and sidewalk in front of the consulate and set up metal barriers along the sidewalk on the other side of the tree-lined road.Uniformed and plainclothes officers kept watch on both sides of the barriers after scattered incidents following the Chengdu announcement on Friday, including a man who set off firecrackers and hecklers who cursed at foreign media shooting video and photos of the scene.A man who tired to unfurl a large placard late Sunday that he called an open letter to the Chinese government was quickly taken away.Earlier, a bus left the consulate grounds and what appeared to be embassy staff spoke with plainclothes police before retreating back behind the property's solid black gates. It wasn't clear who or what was on the bus.Three medium-size trucks arrived and left a few hours later, and cars with diplomatic plates departed in between.The U.S. alleged that the Houston consulate was a nest of Chinese spies who tried to steal data from facilities in Texas, including the Texas A&M medical system and the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston.

At least one shipment was sent to a medical supply company in Georgia from a factory in China\u2019s Hubei Province, where more than 100 Uighur workers were assigned, according to . The work transfer program involves shipping Uighur workers from their homes in the Xinjiang region to factories and other service jobs. They are required to learn Mandarin and pledge their allegiance to China at weekly flag-raising ceremonies.Before the pandemic struck, just four companies in Xinjiang made medical-grade protective equipment, according to China\u2019s National Medical Products Administration. By June 20, at least 51 companies in the region produced medical-grade PPE. Of those 51, at least 17 participated in the state-run labor program involving Uighur workers, the Times reported, citing state media reports and public records. Chinese state-run media has publicized the program as helping to lift Uighurs from poverty by giving them a form of employment and eliminating religious extremism. But penalties and quotas imposed by the Chines government suggest that participation in the program is involuntary.This comes as British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab on Sunday accused Beijing of \u201cgross and egregious\u201d human rights abuses against its Uighur population in China\u2019s western province of Xinjiang.\u00a0Raab said that while Britain wants good relations with China, it could not stand by amid reports of forced sterilization and mass education camps targeting the Uighur population in Xinjiang.\u201cIt is clear that there are gross, egregious human rights abuses going on.

actions are the primary challenge to the free world.\"Pompeo's address\u00a0came a day after the FBI  that the CCP has implemented a \"program\" to secretly and illegally plant military researchers in several U.S. universities to pilfer sensitive materials. Earlier in the week, the State Department announced that China's consulate in Houston would be closed, with Pompeo saying the complex was \"a hub of spying and IP theft.\" China has .Against that fraught backdrop, Pompeo\u00a0promised action that he distinguished from Cold War-era \"containment,\" which aimed to stop the spread of communism and keep the Soviet Union isolated.\"It\u2019s true that unlike the Soviet Union, China is deeply integrated into the global economy,\" he said. \"But Beijing is more dependent on us than we are on them.\"Hours after the FBI alleged a coordinated scheme by China to \"send military scientists to the United States on false pretenses with false covers or false statements about their true employment,\" Pompeo emphasized that the immigration system was prone to abuse.\"We opened our arms to Chinese citizens, only to see the CCP exploit our free and open society,\" Pompeo continued, in perhaps his most pointed remarks directed at the Chinese government. \"General Secretary Xi Jinping is a true believer in a bankrupt totalitarian ideology.\"Throughout his address, which also warned of the encroaching national security threats of major Chinese technology companies, Pompeo took pains to distinguish the CCP from the Chinese people.\"Communists always lie, but the biggest lie is that the Chinese Communist Party speaks for 1.4 billion people who are surveilled, oppressed, and scared to speak out,\" Pompeo remarked.\u00a0\"Quite the contrary. The CCP fears the Chinese people\u2019s honest opinions more than any foreign foe.

President Reagan dealt with the Soviets on the basis of 'trust but verify.' When it comes to the CCP, I say, 'Distrust and verify.'\"Previous Trump administration measures against Chinese officials, students and researchers have included travel bans, registration requirements and other steps intended to reduce the country's footprint in the United States. The administration also has announced its outright rejection of virtually all Chinese maritime claims in the South China Sea.These actions have come as Trump has sought to blame China for the coronavirus outbreak in the U.S., where cases have soared. Trump himself said more closures could be coming if China didn't change its behavior. \"It's always possible,\" he told reporters at the White House.Pompeo similarly hit that theme. \"Just think how much better off the world would\u2019ve been if the doctors in Wuhan had been allowed to raise the alarm about the outbreak of a new coronavirus,\" he said.The State Department announced it ordered the consulate closed within 72 hours after alleging that Chinese agents have tried to steal data from facilities in Texas, including the Texas A&M medical system statewide and The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston.There were indications consulate staff were preparing to leave: Papers were being burned on the consulate grounds late Tuesday night \u2014 a common practice when a diplomatic post is being shuttered on short notice.Cai Wei, the Chinese consul general, told KTRK-TV in Houston the order to shut down was \"quite wrong\" and \"very damaging\" to U.S.-China relations.Asked about accusations of espionage and stealing data, Cai said, \"You have to give some evidence, say something from the facts. ...

But it will almost certainly have the more immediate effect of further infuriating the Chinese, who are already retaliating against numerous U.S. sanctions and other penalties on other matters.It also comes as President Trump has come under growing fire for his response to the COVID-19 pandemic, stepped up criticism of China ahead of the 2020 election and sought to paint his expected Democratic challenger, former Vice President Joe Biden, as weak on China.\u201cToday we are strengthening U.S. policy in a vital, contentious part of that region -- the South China Sea,\u201d Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a press release. \u201cWe are making clear: Beijing\u2019s claims to offshore resources across most of the South China Sea are completely unlawful, as is its campaign of bullying to control them.\u201dPompeo added: \u201cBeijing uses intimidation to undermine the sovereign rights of Southeast Asian coastal states in the South China Sea, bully them out of offshore resources, assert unilateral dominion, and replace international law with \u2018might makes right.\u2019\u201dPreviously, U.S. policy had been to insist that maritime disputes between China and its smaller neighbors be resolved peacefully through U.N.-backed arbitration. But in a statement released Monday, Pompeo said the U.S. now regards virtually all Chinese maritime claims outside its internationally recognized waters to be illegitimate. The shift does not involve disputes over land features that are above sea level, which are considered to be \"territorial\" in nature.Although the U.S. will continue to remain neutral in territorial disputes, the announcement means the administration is in effect siding with Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Vietnam, all of which oppose Chinese assertions of sovereignty over maritime areas surrounding contested islands, reefs and shoals.\u201cThere are clear cases where [China]\u00a0is claiming sovereignty over areas that no country can lawfully claim,\u201d the State Department said in a fact sheet that accompanied the statement.The announcement was released a day after the fourth anniversary of a binding decision by an arbitration panel in favor of the Philippines that rejected China's maritime claims around the Spratly Islands and neighboring reefs and shoals.China has refused to recognize that decision, which it has dismissed as a \u201csham,\u201d and refused to participate in the arbitration proceedings. It has continued to defy the decision with aggressive actions that have brought it into territorial spats with Vietnam, the Philippines and Malaysia in recent years.However, as a result, the administration says China has no valid maritime claims to the fish- and potentially energy-rich Scarborough Reef, Mischief Reef or Second Thomas Shoal. The U.S. has repeatedly said that areas regarded to be part of the Philippines are covered by a U.S.-Philippines mutual defense treaty in the event of an attack on them.In addition to reiterating support for that decision, Pompeo said China cannot legally claim the James Shoal near Malaysia, waters surrounding the Vanguard Bank off Vietnam, the Luconia Shoals near Brunei and Natuna Besar off Indonesia. As such, it says the U.S. will regard any Chinese harassment of fishing vessels or oil exploration in those areas as unlawful.The announcement came amid heightened tensions between the U.S. and China over numerous issues, including the coronavirus pandemic, human rights, Chinese policy in Hong Kong and Tibet and trade, that have sent relations plummeting in recent months.But the practical impact wasn't immediately clear. The U.S. is not a party of the U.N. Law of the Sea treaty that sets out a mechanism for the resolution of disputes. Despite that, the State Department noted that China and its neighbors, including the Philippines, are parties to the treaty and should respect the decision.China has sought to shore up its claim to the sea by building military bases on coral atolls, leading the U.S. to sail its warships through the region in what it calls freedom of operation missions. The United States has no claims itself to the waters but has deployed warships and aircraft for decades to patrol and promote freedom of navigation and overflight in the busy waterway.Last week, China angrily complained about the U.S. flexing its military muscle in the South China Sea by conducting joint exercises with two U.S. aircraft carrier groups in the strategic waterway. The Navy said the USS Nimitz and the USS Ronald Reagan, along with their accompanying vessels and aircraft, conducted exercises \u201cdesigned to maximize air defense capabilities, and extend the reach of long-range precision maritime strikes from carrier-based aircraft in a rapidly evolving area of operations.\u201dChina claims almost all of the South China Sea and routinely objects to any action by the U.S. military in the region.

Good evening, welcome to Washington. I'm Bret Baier. Breaking tonight, President Trump dismisses the stories about intelligence assessments that Russia offered bounties for killing American troops in Afghanistan as a hoax and made up to hurt him and the Republican Party. The President's National Security Adviser is saying today he had a list of retaliatory options if the intelligence had been corroborated. I will ask Secretary of State Mike Pompeo about this story, many other topics around the world in just a few minutes. But first to the lead story from the White House tonight, we begin tonight with Correspondent Kristin Fisher live on the North Lawn. Good evening, Kristin. KRISTIN FISHER, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT: Good evening, Bret. Today for the first time since The New York Times broke the story on Friday, President Trump talked about it on camera and he said if Russia did offer bounties to kill U.S. troops in Afghanistan, he would take action. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I agree with the intelligence people. I think frankly that many of the intelligence people didn't think it was something that even happened. And if it did happen, the Russians would hear about it, and anybody else would hear about it that was involved. FISHER: Today the National Security Adviser confirmed that the intelligence behind to these Russian bounties was shared with U.S. allies. And he pinned the responsibility for the decision to not share that intelligence with President Trump on the President's daily briefer, a career CIA officer. ROBERT O'BRIEN, NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER: She made that decision because she didn't have confidence in the intelligence that came up. She made that call and you know what? I think she made the right call. FISHER: But Democrats disagree. They believe intelligence of this magnitude should have made its way to the president. (INAUDIBLE) as The New York Times and associated press recording, then Democratic Senator Joe Manchin says, not only did the president, quote, fail our service members, but he broke his oath to protect and defend the constitution. It would be unconscionable to think he did not immediately inform Putin that America would retaliate in the most damning way possible. The New York Times is now claiming to have found the money trail behind these bounties to kill U.S. troops in Afghanistan. The paper reports, American officials intercepted electronic data showing large financial transfers from a bank account controlled by Russia's military intelligence agency to a Taliban-linked account. But Defense Secretary Mark Esper says, the Pentagon has no corroborating evidence at this time. Adding, I want to assure all of our service members that we take seriously any and all potential threats against U.S. military personnel. Today, Democratic Senator Bob Menendez introduced an amendment to the Defense Authorization Act to sanction Russian President Vladimir Putin and other top government officials. But the Kremlin calls the claims total B.S. and so does President Trump. TRUMP: I think it's a hoax by the newspapers and the Democrats. (END VIDEOTAPE) FISHER: Now lawmakers from both parties have been calling for a briefing about all of this from people within the intelligence community, not the White House. And tomorrow morning, the Gang of Eight is going to get one from the director of National Intelligence and the director of the CIA, Bret. BAIER: Yes, and the Secretary of State with us in just a moment. Kristin, thank you. The House of Representatives passed a bill to sanction China over their new national security law for Hong Kong. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi saying the purpose of that law is to frighten and suppress peaceful demonstrators demanding freedom. Thousands of protesters defied the law and tear gas on the anniversary of the former British colonies handover to Chinese rule. Hong Kong police responded with the first arrests under the new law. Correspondent Benjamin Hall is following this story from London. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BENJAMIN HALL, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT: Hong Kong police cracked down today both on protesters and free speech. Police fired rubber bullets as they enforce the new security law which gives sweeping powers to China to arrest people for criticizing the government. As crowds marks 23 years since the end of British rule, police held up signs warning of the new law then arrested people who called for Hong Kong independence, or even displayed the British flag. The law is applied to nonresidents and those abroad, meaning it could affect Americans. Carrie Lam, the Chief Executive of Hong Kong tried to defend it. CARRIE LAM, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF HONG KONG: The purpose of this piece of legislation is not just to punish, but it's also to deter. HALL: The U.S. is responding by moving to end special trade terms with Hong Kong and banning defense exports. With Congress moving to impose sanctions on Chinese officials who try to repress political freedoms. The U.K. is extending residency rights and citizenship to up to three million Hong Kongers. And British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has condemned the law. BORIS JOHNSON, PRIME MINISTER OF THE UNITED KINGDOM: It violates Hong Kong's high degree of autonomy and is in direct conflict with Hong Kong basic law. The laws also threatens the freedoms and rights protected by the joint declaration. HALL: The new law is punishable by up to life in Chinese prison. And China will now be allowed to establish security officers in Hong Kong, which means Chinese security forces operating freely on the island. (END VIDEOTAPE) HALL: Observe this note, this new law is a violation of the agreement made with Britain. Effectively the end of the one country, two-systems framework. The end of Hong Kong's autonomy, Bret. BAIER: Benjamin Hall in London. Benjamin, thank you. Federal authorities seized tons of products suspected to be made out of human hair taken from people locked inside Chinese internment camp. U.S. Customs and Border Protection says the goods represent a serious human rights violation. State Department Correspondent Rich Edson has an exclusive television report. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) RICH EDSON, FOX NEWS CHANNEL STATE DEPARTMENT CORRESPONDENT: In this nearly 13-ton shipment seized in New York, hair weaves and extensions from China. The U.S. officials suspect they're made from human hair. Customs official say they're still analyzing the origins of this cargo, though intercepted it based on information indicating prison labor in Xinjiang, China produced it. KEN CUCCINELLI, ACTING DEPUTY SECRETARY, DHS: It is our intention to keep interdicting shipments like the one you saw today in New York that CBP grabbed. We will keep doing that over and over and over. No American wants to buy a product that they find out later was made with slave labor. EDSON: The spokesman for the National Security Council says, quote, if this highly suspicious, 13-ton shipment of human hair indeed turns out to be linked to the Uyghur concentration camps, then this is a new low, even for the Chinese Communist Party. And they will have to answer to the world community for their actions. Officials say the administration is expanding pressure on businesses operating in the United States, urging them to rid their supply chains of products manufactured with forced labor. The federal government has issued an advisory to companies, warning them to monitor their activities in China. MIKE POMPEO, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: CEOs should read this notice closely and be aware of the reputational, economic and legal risks of supporting such assaults on human dignity. EDSON: The notice specifically references Xinjiang, China where officials say the Chinese government has interned more than one million Muslims and minorities like Uyghurs. Subjecting them to surveillance, indoctrination, and forced labor. Last month, President Trump told Axios he held off on sanctioning Chinese officials involved with the Xinjiang mass detention camps because it would have interfered with his trade deal with China. (END VIDEOTAPE) EDSON: But the president has also signed a law directing sanctions against Chinese government officials who were involved in the mass internment camps in Xinjiang. U.S. officials say that Chinese government has located hundreds of thousands of prisoners from those camps to factories across China, Bret. BAIER: Rich Edson live from the state department. Rich, thank you. For more on China, Hong Kong and America's role in the world, joining me now Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Mr. Secretary, thanks for being here. POMPEO: Bret, thanks for having me on this evening. Great to be with you again. BAIER: We just heard you talked about the companies -- American companies warning them to keep forced labor, labor out of their supply chains pointing directly at China and these concentration camps as descried by the Defense Department. Will we see investigations and prosecutions of American businesses who don't heed this warning? POMPEO: Bret, President Trump has been very clear, the way previous administrations have dealt with the Chinese Communist Party by turning the other cheek and letting them abuse America is not going to continue, so we responded across a number of fronts. So you identify one, this forced labor, nobody wants to buy products -- cheap products that were made with slave labor in Western China. They want clarity about the tracing of the product that they have. And so we've asked every business to evaluate their supply chain and make sure that nothing like that ever gets in, and we put them on notice for actions that we may take as we move forward. BAIER: You know, last month, President Trump told Axios that he held off sanctions -- sanctioning Chinese officials involved with the mass detention camps because it would have interfered with his trade deal with China. Should those have been separated? POMPEO: Bret, I've been Secretary of State for 2-1/2 years, no, there's always complex tradeoffs that one has to make. President Trump's been very clear when he signed this bill, the Uyghur bill last week that we were going to take this seriously, we were going to deal with it, we were going to put harsh restrictions in place, we're working on that. No country has responded in the same way that we have. We hope the whole world will join. What's going on there Bret, is historic, there's forced sterilization, forcing women to have abortions, this is a place with some of the most fundamental violations of human rights that the world has seen in an awfully long time. President Trump's been serious about making sure the world sees. And so we hope that countries all across the world, including Muslim countries in the world will see their way clear to putting their shoulder to the grindstone to help resolve this problem as well. BAIER: I guess the question is should the president had done more in a lot of opportunities talking with President Xi? POMPEO: There's no country that has done more, and I'm confident will do more, Bret. BAIER: All right, in Hong Kong, you -- we did a story there about the new security law in place. You've certified that Hong Kong is no longer sufficiently autonomous. Again, should the administration have acted more forcefully to deter Chinese crackdown in Hong Kong? POMPEO: I'll tell you, Bret, I wish previous administration had taken China seriously. It's true, well, this isn't partisan, 40 years of failed American policy with respect to China. This administration is trying to clean it up, trying to get it right. Now the Chinese have taken advantage of us -- advantage of us in multiple ways. We've done really good work, important work trying to protect the freedoms of the people of Hong Kong. General Secretary Xi has chosen to go a different direction, and we're responding in a way that will put pressure on Beijing, and try to maintain whatever we can of the remaining freedoms in Hong Kong. I will tell you the notion that the remains, one country and two systems is fundamentally at odds with the facts on the ground today. I regret that. BAIER: You know that your critics including now John Bolton say that this is all about election politics and to get China to buy soybeans and places that affect reelection. POMPEO: Nonsense. BAIER: OK, that's what we get from that. What does success look like with China, the U.S. and China? What does it look like? Can China be a responsible partner with President Xi at the helm in the Chinese Communist Party? POMPEO: Look, that's up to the Chinese Communist Party, that's their decision to make. What the United States can control is what we do. When there's unfair and nonreciprocal trade, we're going to demand by -- demand that it be right. When they don't do, we're going to do things like placing tariffs on their goods. When they engage in behavior that's militarily threatening to the United States, we're going to put $700 billion into our Department of Defense to keep Americans safe and secure. And when the Chinese engage in cyber espionage, we're going to impose penalties on them so that they will be deterred from doing that. Those are the things we can do. We are hopeful, we want the Chinese people to be successful. The Chinese Communist Party today has made a decision, it wants to be an imperialist power, it wants to be authoritarian in nature and it wants to compete across the world in ways they are consistent with the good things happening for the American people. And frankly, people with democracies all across the world. Presidents Trump's policies are aimed squarely at reversing that. BAIER: I want to spend some time on the Russia bounty story in Afghanistan. First, does the Russian government have American blood on its hands in Afghanistan? POMPEO: Bret, I don't want to get into the intelligence. The intelligence community has put out two statements. I used to have that job; I'm going to -- I'm going to honor what they said. Here's what I can say with absolute certainty, the United States has responded appropriately to the threats that have been presented to it in Afghanistan consistently during my entire 3-1/2 half years. First the CIA director and now as Secretary of State, there are many folks using the Taliban or who have used the Taliban over years and years and years as proxy forces. There's been money funneled in there from all across the world, unfortunately. President Trump has taken this seriously, we are hopeful, we'll make progress on our peace and reconciliation plan. And we will respond to any threat, whether that's Iranians using the Taliban or the Russians, we'll make sure they know. The Russians have been providing weapons to the Taliban for an awful lot of years, and so, this is an ongoing challenge we have. And our forces on the ground under General Miller and the resolute support mission are deeply aware of the threat from the Taliban whether that's supported by any third party or none. BAIER: But you know, you just referenced you were CIA director, there's not often consensus across the intelligence community on Intel. And if it dealt with bounties killing American troops, shouldn't the president have been told about it? We know that it was discussed in the National Security Council, the principles and deck this level. You said today the key members of Congress had that Intel as well, even though there wasn't a consensus. Why wasn't the president briefed on it? POMPEO: Well, Bret, that's not actually quite right. Most intelligence that's red -- there is in fact a consensus. Almost all of the analytical product that I read every day has a consensus across the entire intelligence community. It is often the case that it is not that happens. When that happens, we need to make sure we get it right. But Bret you know this, every morning I wake up, and I read the intelligence materials. And when I read them, there are people all across the world who are threatened, including my officers and embassies all across the world. We don't always make sure that gets to the president, we do the right thing. We make sure the ambassador on the ground knows, that the commander on the ground knows, that our allies who may be threatened as well know. It is the tactical and operational response to keep our soldiers safe and secure that is most important. When the intelligence community feels like something rises to the level of needs to get to the president, I'm very confident they will consistently present it to them. I know that when I was the CIA director, I did that. BAIER: Did you know about this particular Intel piece? POMPEO: You know, I don't want to talk about the Intel in particular on this, Bret. BAIER: All right. POMPEO: I mean, there's just -- I just -- I'm not trying to be clever, there's just so much that has been reported that is not accurate and that is incomplete that by refuting any particular element of it. I'm putting at risk our capacity to actually resolve and figure out what's going on. BAIER: And I want to ask you about that in the leak itself, but here is what the democratic nominee is saying about it. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: He either reads and/or gets briefed on important issues and he forgets it, or he doesn't think it's necessary that he need to know it. He should have a minimum, have picked up the phone and said, Vladimir, old buddy, if any of this is true, and it doesn't cease amigo, you've got a big problem. (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: All right, so, it's not just the Democrats, obviously, you have Senator Chuck Grassley on the Senate floor, saying it demands a serious response. You have two key Republicans in the House. Mike McCaul and Adam Kinzinger, saying, \"There are already those who are politicizing this issue. However, we cannot use let politics overshadow the truth that Republicans and Democrats alike can agree on: The Putin regime cannot be trusted. If the intelligence review process verifies the report, we strongly encourage the administration to take swift and serious action to hold the Putin regime accountable.\" POMPEO: Yes. Bret, there's been no administration to hold the Russians accountable the way this one has. I only wish former Vice President Biden had held the Russians accountable. We've been cleaning up a lot less of a mess. I wish we provided arms to the Ukrainians, I wish he had gotten out of the INF Treaty, I wish he hadn't allowed and invited the Syrians -- the Russians into Syria. I could go on, but you got a short show. The failures of previous administration allowed the Russians a lot of space to move. We've pushed back, we sanctioned more Russians than any other administration in history. I'll take a backseat to no one with respect to what our administration and President Trump has done to hold Vladimir Putin accountable when he is engaged in malign activity. And should we find out that there's evidence that he's putting our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines at risk, anywhere in the world, including in Afghanistan, I am very confident that President Trump will direct me, and he himself will respond appropriately. BAIER: How damaging was this leak? You were CIA Director, the White House press secretary the other day, said that there were rogue officers in the intelligence community who want to undercut the president. You believe that? POMPEO: Bret, I don't know where this leak came from. But when periodicals report this information, it breaks my heart because it puts our intelligence officers and our military men and women at risk. It is -- it is dangerous, it is unlawful, and I hope that we can figure out who did it, and they'll be brought to justice. BAIER: Mr. Secretary, you did speak out when it was alleged that Iran was paying the Taliban $1,000 for each American killed in Afghanistan, as a member of Congress, and you, spoke out about the Obama administration's response at the time, which obviously you criticize in the overall Iran deal. POMPEO: Yes, it's absolutely true. I've spoken about the Iranians providing assistance to the Taliban in my current role as secretary of state as well. I've criticized other governments. We've worked to make sure Pakistan wasn't providing safe haven for the Taliban in Afghanistan too. No, where equal opportunity when it comes to making sure we protect the Americans wherever they're serving. BAIER: All right, let's talk about the couple of other substantive things. One, as you mentioned, the Taliban peace deal. You said that the Taliban would publicly renounce al-Qaeda. You talked about that, I asked you about it back in March. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: It says it will not allow any of its members or other individuals or groups, including al-Qaeda to use the soil of Afghanistan to threaten the security of the United States and its allies. But that's not really a break. That's not a renouncing -- POMPEO: Oh, yes. Oh, yes. BAIER: A renouncing of al-Qaeda? POMPEO: Absolutely. Absolutely, when you say you're not going to let them operate there, you know it, Bret. They've done it for 20 years. They're not going to let them operate it anymore. That's -- that is a central provision. (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: You went further saying that they would eventually take up arms and fight al-Qaeda, working alongside us to destroy al-Qaeda. Have you seen any indication that the Taliban is doing any of that? POMPEO: Yes. BAIER: How? POMPEO: But I can't talk about the things that I have seen, but know this, I spoke with the Taliban, again, just this week and effort to further the peace negotiations to try and get them to the table with the Afghan government. I think we're closer than we were even just a couple of weeks back. The Taliban continued to have pressed upon them the importance of this break from al-Qaeda, and I think we will be able to see when we get to that point, when we have these negotiations commenced, I think the world will be able to see that the Taliban are no longer going to tolerate what they've permitted to happen and that the Pakistanis too will do the things that need to be done to reduce the footprint from al-Qaeda. Remember, Bret, we're down to a couple of 100 active al-Qaeda fighters inside of Afghanistan. The reason we went there in 2001 was to crush al- Qaeda. That has largely been achieved. BAIER: Can you confidently state that America will have U.S. troops in Afghanistan on Election Day? POMPEO: President will ultimately make that decision, Bret. BAIER: OK. One more thing, the E.U. blocking travelers from the U.S. due to the coronavirus pandemic. Your reaction to that, and is there any pushback from the U.S.? POMPEO: Well, remember, we're not allowing Europeans to come here today, either, Bret. We're in close conversation with countries all around the world, including European countries, to make sure that when we reopen our country to travel from their nations. That we do so in a way that keeps American people safer and reduces risk from COVID here in the United States. They have a responsibility to do that for their nations as well. And I'm very confident that we'll get this right with countries all across the world. It's not just the Europeans, we need to get this right, we need to get the economy back up, when you get people traveling all across to the United States, and international travel as well. BAIER: Mr. Secretary, we appreciate your time. POMPEO: Thank you, Bret. BAIER: Happy Independence Day, early. POMPEO: Thank you. Happy Fourth of July to you too, Bret. BAIER: All right, all the best. Up next, California and New York become the latest states to halt the process of reopening. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BAIER: Private payroll processor ADP, found U.S. companies added nearly 2.4 million jobs in June, with small businesses reporting the biggest increase. According to the data, the economy still has about 14 million fewer jobs than it did in February. President Trump is back in more stimulus as part of the recovery from coronavirus, telling Fox Business, he is not -- he not only favors more payments to individuals, but he wants them to be even larger than the first time around. Stocks started the third quarter of 2020 on a mixed note. The Dow dropped 78. The S&P 500 gained 16, and a record high closed for the NASDAQ which finished ahead 96. Here in Washington, the Fourth of July fireworks show will go on with the Trump administration promising one of the largest displays ever. 300 000 masks will be given away on the National Mall. But attendees will not be required to wear them. Other states are pausing the reopening process and mandating masks. Correspondent Jonathan Serrie, looks at the coronavirus trends across the country. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JONATHAN SERRIE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Alarmed by an increase in coronavirus cases, California's governor has announced a three-week closure of bars and restaurant dining rooms. While the mayor of New York City has postponed plans to reopen in restaurant dining. BILL DE BLASIO, MAYOR OF NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK: The news we have gotten from around the country gets worse and worse all the time. SERRIE: Public health officials say large Memorial Day gatherings and complacency over the use of face masks are driving the nation's new spike in COVID-19 cases. Today, an emergency order in Savannah, Georgia, imposed a $500 fine on people who failed to wear face coverings in public. Doctors at Emory University, say mandates are more effective than recommendations based on their own experience in hospitals. JONATHAN LEWIN, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, EMORY HEALTHCARE: When we simply strongly encouraged face masks, we still saw community spread. When we required masks, we saw our infection rates within our workforce plummet. SERRIE: Following a lot of criticism today, President Trump, explained he usually doesn't wear a mask because people who visit the president are tested. DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: If I were in a tight situation with people, I would absolutely be -- (CROSSTALK) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Do you think the public will see that at some point? TRUMP: I mean, I'd have no problem. Actually, I had a mask and I said I like the way I looked. SERRIE: Although the U.S. leads the world and confirm COVID-19 cases, its deaths per 100,000 population remain among the lowest. However, health experts say that's not reason for complacency. DR. CARLOS DEL RIO, PROFESSOR OF MEDICINE, EMORY UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE: I worry less about the numbers right now, and I worry more about the trend. And the fact that we're seeing an exponential growth is really what bothers me right now, and what really makes me very concerned. (END VIDEOTAPE) SERRIE: Public health officials are especially concerned about the upcoming Fourth of July holiday when many people are planning get-togethers, they're urging people to limit the size of gatherings, and to wear face coverings when social distancing is not possible. Bret. BAIER: Jonathan Serrie in Atlanta. Jonathan, thank you. Up next, the end of the chop zone in Seattle and budget cuts for the NYPD. First, here is what some of our Fox affiliates around the country are covering tonight. FOX 4 in Kansas City, where you, the American taxpayer have an almost 30 percent stake in a trucking company that ships military equipment. The Treasury Department will loan YRC worldwide $700 million in exchange for a stake in the company. Congress gave permission to the deal as a way to ensure taxpayer money is not misspent. FOX 7 in Austin, Texas where the U.S. army says partial human remains have been found close to the Leon River in Bell County. In the search for missing Fort Hood soldier Vanessa Guillen. 20-year-old Guillen was last seen on April 22nd, a family attorney says one suspect committed suicide as police closed in on them. Another suspect is in custody. And this is a live look at San Francisco from our affiliate FOX 2 out there. One of the big stories there tonight. Police, say they will stop making mug shots publicly available unless the person poses a threat to the public. The police chief, says the move is part of an effort to stop perpetuating racial stereotypes and protect the presumption of innocence. That's tonight's live look \"OUTSIDE THE BELTWAY\" from SPECIAL REPORT. We'll be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BAIER: In downtown Seattle, the Capitol Hill Organized Protest zone, or CHOP, is no more. Police cleared the area after the mayor declared it an unlawful assembly following two deadly shootings in less than two weeks there. Correspondent Dan Springer reports. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DAN SPRINGER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Acting on the mayor's executive order signed overnight, police officers and FBI agents moved into the area known as CHOP just before 5:00 a.m. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We need to be clear now. If we don't clear out then we'll be forced to arrest. SPRINGER: While most peacefully left, police, some in riot gear, did arrest at least 30 people for offenses including failure to disperse, assault, and unlawful weapon possession. CARMEN BEST, SEATTLE POLICE CHIEF: What has happened here on these streets is lawless, and it's brutal, and bottom line, it is simply unacceptable. SPRINGER: Established in early June in the wake of George Floyd's death, what was initially an overwhelmingly peaceful protest soon became linked to incidents of violence. Black Lives Matter and similar groups had already pulled out, and there was now concern from both protesters and the city that CHOP's original message, a call for police reform, has been drowned out. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We're going to have to work 10 times as hard to get our message back on track. BEST: Black Lives Matter, and I too want to help propel this movement forward, but enough is enough. (END VIDEOTAPE) SPRINGER: Seattle police are back inside the east precinct which they abandoned in early June. The question now is how long they will hold and keep it from becoming of point again as protestors say the idea of CHOP isn't over yet. Bret? BAIER: Dan Springer in Seattle. Dan, thanks. Just after midnight early this morning, New York City's City Council passed the city's $88 billion budget that includes $1 billion in cuts to the NYPD. But that has not resulted in the end of Occupy City Hall protesters. Correspondent Aishah Hasnie looks at the situation in the big apple today. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: As hereby adopted as of 12:26 p.m. -- AISHAH HASNIE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: With ah historic vote, New York City leaders defunded the NYPD's $6 billion budget by close to $1 billion. The 2021 budget cuts include cutting the number of recruits in half, which would save $40 million, and a reduction on police overtime spending by $352 million. And it comes at a time when shootings are up across the city compared to this time last year. The city faces a $9 billion loss due to coronavirus, and police retirements are rising. DERMOT SHEA, NEW YORK CITY POLICE COMMISSIONER: Let's mark the date on the calendar and how long it's going to be before we'll have that conversation about New Yorkers crying out for more police. HASNIE: But some protesters outside city hall and council members feel the budget did not go far enough. They wanted to eliminate school safety officers and introduce a hiring freeze on police. JONATHAN LYKES, BLACK YOUTH PROJECT 100: We're not happy with the budget, let me be clear. We know that they political tricks. HASNIE: Mayor Bill de Blasio said he will continue to support peaceful protests, but the city needs to move forward now. Protesters, though, have a different message for their mayor. LYKES: We're coming for you. We're going to escalate tactics. We're going to be disruptive. (END VIDEOTAPE) HASNIE: And that very same organizer tells me the people in charge of organizing Occupy City Hall will leave now that the budget has passed, but they will continue to support anyone who wants to stay. Bret? BAIER: Aishah, thank you. Up next, the battle over our nation's history ahead of the holiday weekend. First, Beyond our Borders tonight. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announcing a delay in the annexation of parts of the occupied West Bank. The process was supposed to begin today, and still may take place later this month. Several thousand Palestinians peacefully marched in Gaza City to protest those plans. Russian voters approved a package of constitutional changes allowing President Vladimir Putin to serve two more terms, possibly staying in power until 2036. The weeklong vote was tarnished by reports of pressure on voters and other irregularities. Putin, who has been in power more than two decades, did not mentioning his political future during a speech Tuesday and has yet to commit to running to 2024 when his current term expires. And way Beyond our Borders, NASA astronauts replaced batteries on the outside of the International Space Station today. For every two batteries removed, a new one and improved one is installed to power the station while on the night side of the earth. The battery replacement process began in 2017 and should be completed this month. Just some of the other stories beyond our border tonight. We'll be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BAIER: In our Democracy 2020 report, Oklahoma voters narrowly approved a state constitutional amendment to expand Medicaid health coverage to tens of thousands of low-income residents. Oklahoma is the first state to amend its constitution to expand Medicaid. For other states accomplished it through ballot questions. In Colorado, five-term Congressman Scott Tipton lost his Republican primary contest to pro-gun and pro-border wall candidate Lauren Boebert. She will run in November against Diane Mitsch Bush who won the Democratic primary in the district. The Colorado Senate race, meantime, set as well. Former governor John Hickenlooper won the Democratic primary against a progressive opponent and will face Republican incumbent Senator Cory Gardner. The mayor of Richmond, Virginia, the former capital of the Confederacy, has ordered to removal of all Confederate statues standing on city land. This afternoon the of Stonewall Jackson on Richmond's Monument Avenue came down to the cheers of a surrounding crowd. The move comes at a time when the fight over Confederacy symbols takes center stage on Capitol Hill. Congressional correspondent Chad Pergram has the story. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) CHAD PERGRAM, FOX NEWS PRODUCER: Pageantry and imagery defined most Fourths of July. This holiday could ignite flashpoints around the nation's uncomfortable history. There's concern demonstrators could again try to topple controversial statues. KAYLEIGH MCENANY, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: Law and order are the building blocks to the American dream. Anarchy in our streets is unacceptable. PERGRAM: The Department of Homeland Security is deploying special teams to protect federal monuments in Portland, Oregon, and Washington, D.C. President Trump warned people his executive order to safeguard monuments is in full force. That prompted a veto threat of the Senate's annual defense bill if lawmakers stand by a plan to rename bases named after Confederates. SEN. JAMES INHOFE (R-OK), SENATE ARMED SERVICES COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN: He's serious about it. You know the president. He makes up his mind, and he does things. SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER, (D-NY) SENATE MINORITY LEADER: This is nothing but typical bluster from President Trump. At the NDAA will pass. PERGRAM: Still, this bill may not go to the president to sign until fall. SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL, (R-KY) SENATE MAJORITY LEADER: I hope the president would reconsider vetoing the entire defense bill, which includes pay raises for our troops, over a provision in there that could lead to changing the names of some of these military bases. PERGRAM: But members of the Congressional Black Caucus aren't convinced some changes are truly for racial justice, such as Mississippi's decision to mothball its flag with the Confederate emblem. SEN. BENNIE THOMPSON, (D-MS) CONGRESSIONAL BLACK CAUCUS: When SEC, NCAA, the bankers, the richest man in the state who was a Trump delegate said we need to change the flag, boom, it changed. (END VIDEOTAPE) PERGRAM: President Trump believes the culture war over monuments works politically in his favor, but Democrats think that Black Lives Matter tilts the field in their direction. That's why fights over statues and military bases represents a proxy war ahead of November. Bret? BAIER: Chad Pergram live on the Hill. Chad, thanks. Next up, the panel reacts to my interview with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and the big stories around the world, next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: Does the Russian government have American blood on its hands in Afghanistan? MIKE POMPEO, SECRETARY OF STATE: Bret, I don't want to get into the intelligence. The United States has responded appropriately to the threats that have been presented to it in Afghanistan consistently. There are many folks using the Taliban, or who have used the Taliban over years and years and years as proxy forces. I don't know where this leak came from, but when periodicals report this information, it breaks my heart, because it puts our intelligent officers and our military men and women at risk. It is dangerous, it is unlawful, and I hope that we can figure out who did it, and they'll be brought to justice. (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: Secretary of State Mike Pompeo talking about that Russia bounty story in Afghanistan. We'll start there with our panel, Ben Domenech, publisher of \"The Federalist,\" Mara Liasson, national political correspondent for National Public Radio, and Josh Holmes, former top advisor to Mitch McConnell, now president of Cavalry Consultants. Ben, thoughts on his answer, and the story overall. BEN DOMENECH, \"THE FEDERALIST\": First off, I think his answer was as clarifying as he possibly could be in this moment, which is clearly, there's a big muddle here about where this intelligence came from, why it was leaked in the way that it was, and what we are supposed to take away from this situation overall. He is correct that the Taliban has been used as a proxy force in all sorts of different ways. It does seem like this story came out in a way that would undermine the efforts of American forces to figure out what was actually going on in this scenario, and coming at the truth. But I think that that's probably going to lead to a discovery that leads to an indication that this was trying to do something that undermined the president and undermined his overall efforts in the region. BAIER: Clearly the president think so, said it on FOX Business. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, (R) PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: When you bring something into a president, and I see many, many things. And I'm sure I don't see many things that they don't think rose to the occasion. This didn't rise to the occasion. And from what I hear, and I hear it pretty good, the intelligence people, many of them didn't believe it happened at all. I think it's a hoax. I think it's a hoax by the newspapers and the Democrats. (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: Mara? MARA LIASSON, NATIONAL POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, NATIONAL PUBLIC RADIO: Yes, well, Secretary Pompeo didn't say it was a hoax. He was angry that it leaked, I understand that, but I guess the question now is, is this real or not? Did the Russians but a bounty on U.S. troops? And what does the president want to do about it, if anything? So I think that's the next chapter of this. They're going to try to find out who leaked it, that's kind of one problem. But the other one is, if it's true, what is the administration going to do? BAIER: Josh, the national security advisor spoke about the CIA briefer. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ROBERT O'BRIEN, NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER: The person who decided early on whether the president should be briefed on this in Oval intelligence briefing was his career -- senior career civil servant CIA officer. And she made that decision because she didn't have confidence in the intelligence that came up. She made that call. And you know what, I think she made the right call. (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: So there's all kinds of people speculating, did they not want to bring it to President Trump because of what he would think about it, would he tweet about it, would he talk to President Putin in some way, shape, or form about it? That's not what they're saying, Josh. JOSH HOLMES, CAVALRY CONSULTANTS: No, they're not saying that at all. What they're saying is that the CIA and the intelligence services concluded that it wasn't ready for primetime, that in fact it wasn't ready to present the president or congressional leaders, for that matter. I don't think it's difficult to see what's happening here. It was, however, determined fit to print in \"The New York Times.\" And the reason it is fit to leak to \"The New York Times\" is because it goes to this ongoing narrative that Democrats, frankly, cannot let go of, that somehow this president is preferential to Russia. We've gone through three-and-a-half years, tens of millions of dollars in investigations, conclusions definitively that that is not the case, both in terms of policy and in terms of past actions. And yet here we are again debating the same thing. I don't think there's any question in anybody's mind that if we have definitive proof that Russia had bounties on American soldiers that this president is going to act decisively to ensure that that doesn't happen, and they'll have a huge response if it does. BAIER: We mentioned the Iranian bounties on American soldiers in Afghanistan, and reaction of the Obama administration after that, Ben. DOMENECH: So I certainly think that the president would have a very robust response of this. The truth is that, as Josh indicated, we've had all of these allegations put out there, including by this current Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, who continues to engage in this ridiculous campaign where she suggests that Vladimir Putin has some of kind of thing over on the president. It's ludicrous, it's laughable. But it is a situation where I think when issues like this arise, we want to have clarity. And I think in this case, we don't really have clarity about what went on here, and we may not be able to have clarity because of the way that this story played out. BAIER: Meantime, the COVID situation, the news about the cases around the country and spikes in different states, Mara, the president speaking out that he's OK with masks. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, (R) PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I'm all for masks, I think masks are good. I would wear -- if I were in a group of people and I was close -- UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You would wear one? TRUMP: I would. I have. People have seen me wearing one. If I'm in a group of people where were not 10 feet away, but usually I'm not in that position. And everyone's tested. Because I'm the president, they get tested before they see me. But if I was in a tight situation with people, I would absolutely. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Do think the public will see that at some point? TRUMP: I'd have no problem. Actually, I had a mask on. I sort of liked the way I looked. (END VIDEO CLIP) (LAUGHTER) BAIER: Mara, listen, there are, on the serious side of this, Mara -- LIASSON: This is a new, this is -- BAIER: There's the economic guys that are looking at this saying, if you're pro-mask and you don't shut down, you could save the country a lot of GDP percentage that might go down if there's another shutdown. LIASSON: There's been some pretty studying estimates that masks help the economy, because you can go back to work with them. This is a new message from the president than the past. He suggested to the \"Wall Street Journal\" that people who wear masks are doing it to show their disapproval of him. He said to a reporter at the White House, you're wearing a mask because it's politically correct. So it sounds like the White House is changing its tune on masks. The question is, will the president start wearing one, not because he needs it to protect himself or others in the White House, but to model this behavior as something that other people should do. BAIER: And how much will he talk about COVID and be a part of the task force? There's all kinds of questions coming up with the politics. Panel, thank you so much with the secretary's interview. We'll stop there. Appreciate it. When we come back, the brighter side of things, some good news. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BAIER: Finally tonight, when life gives you lemons, you try to make lemonade, right? Well, that was the case for a five-year-old Cooper Wallweber when he heard that a volunteer firefighter was injured in a shooting at a local restaurant, he felt compelled to do something good for her. The Missouri boy got to work making and selling lemonade, raising more than $3,000 from his lemonade stand to help her out. Good job. Princess Paige Lemonade is well known in some neighborhoods around Minneapolis. Its founder, six-year-old Paige, sells lemonade in stores around the Twin Cities. The young entrepreneur donates the profits to the Ronald McDonald House for Families living near a sick child getting treatment, and sometimes Paige visits those kids who are dealing with the medical issues, and of course she shares her lemonade. So there you go, making lemonade out of lemons. Thanks for inviting us into your home tonight. That's it for the SPECIAL REPORT, fair, balanced, and still unafraid. \"THE STORY\" hosted by Martha MacCallum starts right now.

The fake tweets offered to send $2,000 for every $1,000 sent to a bitcoin address.Publicly available\u00a0 show that the scammer account has already\u00a0received hundreds of transfers totaling more than $100,000 as of 6:30 p.m. ET. The account has transferred out approximately half that amount, but experts cautioned that scammers sometimes appear to distribute money so that their accounts appear legitimate.Trump campaign director of communications Tim Murtaugh quickly mocked the apparent scam, calling it a \"perfect metaphor for Biden's pitch to taxpayers.\" No accounts affiliated with President Trump appeared to have been hacked as of late Wednesday.Nearly an hour after the first accounts were hacked, Twitter put out a statement noting that it was aware of a \u201csecurity incident impacting accounts on Twitter.\u201d The company said it is investigating and working to fix it, and promised an update shortly.Twitter responded to a request for comment from Fox News by pointing to its tweet addressing the matter.Later on Wednesday, Twitter issued a new statement: \"You may be unable to Tweet or reset your password while we review and address this incident.\"Fox News has confirmed that many\u00a0\"verified\" accounts were unable to tweet at all as of 6:30 p.m. ET, indicating that the site had triggered a kill-switch for high-profile accounts while the problem is under investigation.Limited functionality returned soon afterwards for some\u00a0of these verified accounts, which are known as \"bluechecks\" because they deliberately sought and obtained a blue checkmark-style badge from Twitter that publicly verifies their identity. Many \"bluechecks\" are left-of-center journalists or entertainers. Twitter has largely discontinued the practice of awarding the checkmarks, which have since gained the cliquish\u00a0mystique of a\u00a0Boy Scouts merit badge.Immediately after \"bluechecks\" were suspended from posting, non-verified accounts\u00a0threw something of an online party --\u00a0with\u00a0Twitter \u00a0ComfortablySmug : \"To all the bluechecks watching in silent horror as we take back what is ours: You should move to a small town, somewhere the rule of law still exists. You will not survive here. You are not a wolf, and this is a land of wolves now.\" ComfortablySmug's followers often refer to his Twitter account as \"The Real America.\"A spokesperson for , on behalf of ComfortablySmug, told Fox News: \"Twitter locked down these accounts out of an abundance of caution. Thanks to the nonstop advice from our verified friends over the last six months, we know they are advocates of lockdowns. We strongly urge Twitter to continue locking down all these accounts until the threat of any hacking drops to 0.\"The spokesperson added that\u00a0Smug Industries \"commends Twitter for their prompt and decisive action during this unprecedented event.\"Another poster, Adam Crigler, unilaterally declared himself the \"warlord of Twitter.\" The move echoed a similar dramatic power-grab by the self-described \"warlord\" of the ill-fated Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone (CHAZ) in Seattle.After the hack, images circulated appearing to show the internal administrator panel of a Twitter employee. The panel includes an option to \"blacklist\" a \"trend,\" or a topic that Twitter elevates and makes visible to many viewers.For some commentators, the panel was evidence that Twitter indeed censors viewpoints.The panel would also appear to  that it has replaced the word \"blacklist\" with \"denylist\" in internal programming materials.Elsewhere, cybersecurity experts speculated that a Twitter employee's account credentials had been hijacked, allowing broad access; or that a major security vulnerability may have been exploited. Others wondered if the apparent scam wasn't simply a cover for a larger operation.However, it remained possible that someone inside the company was directly responsible. The Daily Caller's editorial director, Vince Coglianese, pointed out on Twitter that in\u00a02017, a rogue Twitter employee briefly\u00a0.As the episode unfolded, Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo.,\u00a0\u00a0to Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey seeking cooperation with law enforcement. Hawley has previously proposed  due to its editorial decisions to censor some political content; Trump later  to that effect.\u201cI am concerned that this event may represent not merely a coordinated set of separate hacking incidents but rather a successful attack on the security of Twitter itself,\" Hawley said. \"As you know, millions of your users rely on your service not just to tweet publicly but also to communicate privately through your direct message service. A successful attack on your system\u2019s servers represents a threat to all of your users\u2019 privacy and data security.\u201dLate Wednesday, Dorsey tweeted that it was a \"tough day for us at Twitter,\" and that more information would be coming.Bezos, Gates and Musk are among the 10 richest people in the world, with tens of millions of followers on Twitter.The apparently fake tweets were all eventually deleted, although the hackers quickly reposted the messages in some cases.", "comment": "", "topic": "Twitter", "date": " July 15"}, {"cover": "https://a57.foxnews.com/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/694940094001/ca7f7a0c-0302-4fa5-bb05-4e966c6d65de/76b2e791-77d7-43eb-865b-42bccdc6c3d0/1280x720/match/156/88/image.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "title": "China announces sanctions against Rubio, Cruz over Uighur Muslims", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/politics/china-announces-sanctions-against-us-sens-rubio-cruz-uighurs-issue", "subtitle": "China on Monday announced sanctions against a number of U.S. officials, including\u00a0Senators Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz, in retaliation for legislation intended to punish senior Chinese officials over the alleged treatment of the Uighur Muslim minority in Xinjiang, according to multiple reports.", "keyword": "China and Security", "website": "Fox News", "author": "David Aaro", "content": " on Monday announced sanctions against a number of . officials, including\u00a0Sens.\u00a0 and , in retaliation for legislation intended to punish senior Chinese officials over Beijing's alleged treatment of minority Uighur Muslims\u00a0in Xinjiang, according to multiple reports.Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said the sanctions against the U.S. officials, would begin on Monday.

As a member of the commission, I vow one simple thing: no action or sanction against me for my work as a commissioner to expose human rights violations will deter my commitment to holding China accountable and speaking out against its aggressive actions and inhumanity.For far too long, Chinese President Xi Jinping and his communist regime have been allowed to trample the basic human dignity of the Uighur population in Xinjiang. The United States and the international community cannot turn a blind eye to the atrocities happening there. With a committed Congress coupled with the leadership of , our country has begun to take the necessary steps to confront the Chinese regime. This action is needed.The Chinese Communist Party is working to destroy the Uighur population.\u00a0Currently,\u00a0there are an estimated 1 million Uighurs in mass internment camps in China. All of them are subject to torture, medical neglect and forced labor at the hands of the brutal Chinese dictatorship.In addition, there is disturbing evidence of forced sterilizations\u00a0and other coercive measures used to curtail family size and population growth among ethnic Uighurs.In these camps, the Uighurs \u2014 who are of Turkic ethnicity, predominately Muslim and speak their own language \u2014 undergo what the communists euphemistically dub \u201creeducation.\u201d Chinese Communist Party officials indoctrinate them in the teachings of communism and the tenants of the Chinese revolution.The Uighurs are also forced to learn Mandarin Chinese, renounce their religion, and pledge absolute loyalty to the Chinese communist regime. At the same time they are forced to work for little or no pay \u2014 many times making low-cost products exported to the U.S. that line American store shelves.These coercive policies are part of the Chinese government\u2019s series of authoritarian campaigns \u2014 such as the power grab in Hong Kong \u2014 \u00a0as Chinese leaders crack down on what they perceive as threats to the strength and stability of the communist regime.The Uighurs\u2019 unique identity, separate from the population in the rest of mainland China, runs counter to President Xi\u2019s doctrine of\u00a0Sinicization \u2014 \u00a0the deliberate guidance of the Chinese people towards a unified race and culture modeled after the Han Chinese.Despite calls by the United States, our allies and several instrumental international organizations to immediately cease this genocide against the Uighurs, China claims that that its mass internment camps \u2014 which it calls \u201cvocational training centers\u201d\u2014 don\u2019t infringe on the basic human rights of the Uighurs.However, the Chinese have blocked foreign journalists and international inspectors from surveying the camps. Let\u2019s make one thing clear \u2014 these are concentration camps.But the world is finally waking up to China\u2019s extraordinarily evil practices and taking action against its government. Last month, President Trump signed into law legislation born out of the final recommendations made by the Congressional-Executive Commission on China.The Uighur Human Rights and Policy Act of 2020 applies sanctions to senior Chinese officials who are directly responsible for the ongoing repression of the Uighur population.Invoking the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act, the White House has taken swift action against several key Chinese Politburo officials, including the Communist Party secretary and former deputy party secretary of the Xinjiang Autonomous Region.The U.S. Treasury Department issued the sanctions after exposing connections between these key individuals and serious, inhumane crimes against ethnic minorities in China, including the Uighurs.I applaud Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and President Trump for these proactive steps.I refuse to be deterred or be threatened by the latest sanctions against the Congressional-Executive Commission on China. We will continue to push our international partners to hold China accountable. We will continue to do our part to ensure that the communists in China are exposed for their reprehensible policies of ethnic genocide, and to expose U.S. companies complicit in this debasement.History will be our judge and should be our teacher.", "comment": "(120)", "topic": "OPINION", "date": " July 17"}, {"cover": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/06/156/88/AP19180108597311.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "title": "Gordon Chang reacts to Houston consulate order: China is 'deliberately stoking racial tensions'", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/media/gordon-chang-reacts-to-houston-consulate-order-china-is-stoking-racial-tensions", "subtitle": "China is stoking racial tensions in the United States,\u00a0Fox News Asia analyst Gordon Chang stated Wednesday.", "keyword": "China and Security", "website": "Fox News", "author": "Julia Musto", "content": " is stoking racial tensions in the United States,\u00a0Fox News Asia analyst  stated Wednesday.In an interview on\u00a0\u00a0 Chang pointed out that the reason the  said the Chinese consulate in  was  was that it was \"involved in \" and because they \"wanted to protect the information of U.S. individuals.\"\"Also, there are stories that\u00a0this consulate had links with protest groups in the\u00a0United States providing\u00a0\u00a0and logistical\u00a0support.\u00a0That\u2019s unconfirmed,\" he added. \"But, what is confirmed is that the Chinese Foreign Ministry and the\u00a0Communist Party's global ties\u00a0have been engaged in a\u00a0malicious , deliberately stoking\u00a0racial tensions in the U.S.\"And,\u00a0U.S. Customs has seized items\u00a0coming from China this year that\u00a0would be very handy for\u00a0,\" Chang noted.China, however, called the closure an \"unprecedented escalation\" by the United States and threatened to retaliate.\u201cChina demands the U.S. revoke the wrong decision.

Delmonico, the former president of The Transplantation Society (TTS), the chief medical officer of the New England Organ Bank (NEOB)\u00a0and chair of the WHO Task Force on donation and transplantation of human organs and tissues, reportedly\u00a0: \"The biggest feature of the Chinese experience in organ transplantation is the strong support from the Chinese government, which is an example that many countries should follow.\u201dDr. Edward Kelley, director of the Department of Service Provision and Security at the WHO headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland, echoed\u00a0the praise.\u00a0According to China\u2019s , he stated China and other countries participating in the meeting are \u201cglobal models in the field of organ transplantation.\u201dA year earlier, the WHO \u2013 along with TTS\u00a0in Canada and the Vatican\u2019s Pontifical Academy of Science \u2013 co-hosted the Summit Against Organ Trafficking, in which China\u2019s Dr. Huang Jiefu was controversially invited as a  to present\u00a0\u201cChina\u2019s model\u201d on organ transplantation practice.\u201cThen, at the 70th\u00a0World Health Assembly (WHA) on May 2017, China representatives proposed WHO to establish a specific task force on organ transplantation,\u201d Lin pointed out. \u201cThen in March 2018, driven by the Chinese government, WHO Task Force on Donation & Transplantation of Human Organs and Tissues was formally established.\u201d Delmonico became one of the two chairmen of this task force and two Chinese doctors,\u00a0Huang Jiefu and Wang Haibo,\u00a0serve as members.The task force has \u00a0transplantation as a \u201cform of treatment that is nowadays acknowledged as the best and frequently the only life-saving therapy for end-stage organ failure.\u201dThe WHO did not immediately respond to a request for comment on allegations about Chinese organ transplants or whether any further investigation will be undertaken, but its stance in recent years has perplexed many activists and experts.\u201cWe know that organ harvesting affects especially religious minorities like Uighurs, Tibetans, the Falun Gong, Christian pastors, and other political dissidents and persons who are members of politically sensitive groups, according to the Chinese people. The CCP will stop at nothing to silence its critics,\u201d added Olivia Enos, a senior policy analyst and Asian studies expert at The Heritage Foundation.\u201cAny promises that the CCP will stop organ harvesting ring hollow. The CCP has made various promises to end other terrible  practices, including organ harvesting, but has never done so.\u201dIn late May, after an investigation into the WHO's ties to Chinese leadership, amid\u00a0a mass outbreak of the novel coronavirus, President Trump  from the organization.", "comment": "(128)", "topic": "HEALTH", "date": " July 30"}, {"cover": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/07/156/88/AP20186092227694.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "title": "Fred Fleitz: At Mount Rushmore, Trump right to highlight danger leftist radicals pose to America", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/trump-mount-rushmore-fred-fleitz", "subtitle": "President Trump celebrated America\u2019s independence and our nation\u2019s 244th birthday Friday night with stirring speech at Mount Rushmore in South Dakota calling attention to serious threats America faces here at home from radical lawbreakers.", "keyword": "China and Security", "website": "Fox News", "author": "", "content": " celebrated America\u2019s independence and our nation\u2019s 244th birthday Friday night with stirring speech at Mount Rushmore in South Dakota calling attention to serious threats America faces here at home from radical lawbreakers. Praising the four presidents whose 60-foot-high heads are carved into a mountain in the Black Hills \u2013 George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln and Theodore Roosevelt \u2013 Trump attacked extremists who  such great Americans and sought to tear down their statues and monuments.\u201cThe radical ideology attacking our country advances under the banner of social justice. But in truth, it would demolish both justice and society,\u201d the president said. \u201cIt would transform justice into an instrument of division and vengeance and turn our free society into a place of repression, domination and exclusion. They want to silence us, but we will not be silenced.\u201dThis celebration at the memorial known as the Shrine to Democracy could not have come at a better time.Our democratic values are being challenged by increasingly intolerant radicals. These leftists misrepresent our history and seek to impose socialism and censorship on those who disagree. As we have seen over the last two months, the radical left is prepared to do this through mob rule and violence.Despite the insistence by the left and the mainstream media that our nation is hopelessly unjust, the United States is an ever-improving great experiment. The vast majority of Americans know this. So does the rest of the world, which is why the United States is by far the leading  for immigrants.Billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk, who was born in South Africa, expressed this in an interview this year about his phenomenal success: \u201cAmerica is the land of opportunity \u2013 there is no other country where I could have done this.\u201dBut the American experiment is fragile.On the final day of the Constitutional Convention in 1787, Benjamin Franklin, was asked: \u201cWhat do we have, a republic or a monarchy?\u201d He replied: \u201cA republic, if you can keep it.\u201dAlthough most Americans reject the radical leftist attacks on our country and history, the views of the extremists will take root unless we forcefully refute them.This means not just rejecting the recent lawlessness led by radical leftist groups like Black Lives Matters (BLM) and Antifa, but actively speaking out to defend our history of freedom. This must include keeping the left\u2019s America-hating, socialist narrative out of our schools.We live in a dangerous world with enemies who would like to end the American experiment and our status as the world\u2019s superpower.Russia tried to interfere in the 2016 presidential election. It will try to do so again this year, along with other nations, especially China.America\u2019s adversaries are encouraging BLM and Antifa to undermine our country. China is openly  BLM to bash the U.S. government and discredit liberal democracies to deflect criticism of Chinese human rights violations.America faces growing international security threats, including the coronavirus pandemic.Russia and China are expanding and improving their nuclear arsenals while America struggles to keep up.North Korea has not ended its nuclear and ballistic missile programs.Iran continues to develop its missile program and likely has robust clandestine nuclear weapons.The threat from radical Islamist terrorism continues and these terrorist groups likely are planning more potent attacks.China is and likely will remain the most serious security threat to the United States and the world. China\u2019s ruling Communist Party is not interested in peaceful co-existence or free and fair trade.Beijing is using diplomatic, military, economic, cyber, and espionage pressure and tools to supplant the United States as the global superpower and install a Chinese-led, anti-democratic world order.China has taken advantage of diverted American attention due to the coronavirus pandemic and violent protests to intensify its efforts to claim the South China Sea as part of its territory and crush what was left of Hong Kong\u2019s democracy.Fortunately, we have a president who recognizes foreign threats and is taking steps to defend our security and freedom. President Trump has built up and modernized our military, greatly improving readiness.The 2018 Nuclear Posture Review is a strategy this administration has acted on to modernize the U.S. nuclear arsenal after years of neglect.The Trump administration destroyed the ISIS state in Syria and Iraq and used military strikes to punish Syria for using chemical weapons against its people.President Trump ended President Barack Obama\u2019s appeasement of Iran by exiting the flawed 2015 nuclear deal.Trump also has called China out on its exploitative trade practices and intellectual property theft, using tariffs to press for free and fair trade. The U.S. and China agreed to a \u201cPhase One\u201d trade deal in January that addressed some of these concerns. Trump officials plan to open talks on a broader \u201cPhase Two\u201d deal if Trump wins reelection.The winner of the 2020 presidential election should continue and build upon these policies.As we celebrate the birth of our nation this weekend, we honor an exceptional nation that is a global beacon of freedom, liberty and opportunity.

The number of packages being reported also varied. In Indiana, for instance, an official with the\u00a0state attorney general\u2019s office said it had\u00a0received only a handful of reports, while in Ohio, officials have received roughly 150 calls about the packages over the past month.\u201cWe have done some researching and it does appear that these seeds are tied with an online scam called \u2018brushing\u2019,\u201d the\u00a0\u00a0\u2013\u00a0one of the states where the \u00a0\u2013\u00a0posted on Facebook. \u201cA brushing scam is an exploit by a vendor used to bolster product ratings and increase visibility online by shipping an inexpensive product to an unwitting receiver and then submitting positive reviews on the receiver\u2019s behalf under the guise of a verified owner.\u201cAlthough not directly dangerous, we would still prefer that people contact us to properly dispose of the seeds,\u201d the department added.North Carolina\u2019s Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services also  the deliveries were \u201clikely the product of an international Internet scam.\u201dIt\u2019s not the first time this type of scam has surfaced. In 2018, a\u00a0\u00a0containing items ranging from\u00a0USB-powered humidifiers to rechargeable dog collars feared they were being targeted.Here\u2019s how the scam works: a seller trying to boost the ratings of their own merchandise sets up a fake email account to create an Amazon profile, then purchases the items with a gift card and ships them to the address of a random person.Once the package is delivered, the owner of the Amazon account is then listed as a \u201cverified buyer\u201d of the product and can write a positive review of it that gets higher placement on product pages because of their status, James Thomson, a former business consultant for Amazon\u00a0told the Boston Globe at the time when asked about the couple\u2019s deliveries.However, the\u00a0deliveries of the plant seeds are\u00a0more widespread\u00a0and it's not immediately clear\u00a0which e-commerce website the fake reviews may be appearing on, if this is the motive behind the packages.On Monday,\u00a0Virginia Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services spokesperson Michael Wallace told the New York Times that the agency has received\u00a0\u201cover 900 emails and several hundred telephone calls\u201d from people who claimed to have received the seeds.\u00a0say they have gotten 160 reports about the seeds.\u00a0And in Louisiana, Agriculture and Forestry Commissioner Mike Strain told the\u00a0\u00a0that some of the\u00a0packages\u00a0sent to residents there appear to\u00a0contain seeds for\u00a0water lily plants.\u201cObviously they\u2019re not jewelry,\u201d\u00a0Lori Culley, a resident from Tooele, Utah,\u00a0said to\u00a0Fox13\u00a0.\u201cAt this time, we are not sure what the seeds are and therefore are urging everyone to be exceedingly vigilant,\u201d\u00a0\u00a0also said in a statement. \u201cIf you have received one of these packages in the mail, please use extreme caution by not touching the contents and securing the package in a plastic bag.\u201d", "comment": "(3,667)", "topic": "China", "date": " July 28"}, {"cover": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/156/88/China-prisoners.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "title": "Chinese Ambassador to UK pressed on purported drone video of Uighur prisoners being herded into trains", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/world/chinese-ambassador-to-uk-pressed-over-video", "subtitle": "A\u00a0Chinese\u00a0official\u00a0who was\u00a0shown a video purportedly depicting Uighur Muslims\u00a0being blindfolded and led into trains is insisting\u00a0he does \u201cnot know\u201d where the footage is from.\u00a0", "keyword": "China and Security", "website": "Fox News", "author": "Greg Norman", "content": "A\u00a0\u00a0official\u00a0who was\u00a0shown a video purportedly depicting Uighur Muslims\u00a0being blindfolded and led into trains is insisting\u00a0he does \u201cnot know\u201d where the footage is from.Liu Xiaoming, China\u2019s ambassador to the\u00a0, was pressed by BBC host Andrew Marr to explain the clip during a television interview\u00a0Sunday.\u201cLet's look at some very disturbing drone footage that\u2019s been widely shared around the world.

The assessment is supported by partners at the Canadian Communication Security Establishment (CSE), the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the Cybersecurity Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)\u00a0and the National Security Agency (NSA).\u201cIt is completely unacceptable that the Russian Intelligence Services are targeting those working to combat the coronavirus pandemic,'' U.K.'s Foreign Secretary  said in a statement. \u201cWhile others pursue their selfish interests with reckless behavior, the U.K. and its allies are getting on with the hard work of finding a vaccine and protecting global health.''The NCSC made the announcement in a press release, where it claimed\u00a0\u201cAPT29\u2019s campaign of malicious activity is ongoing, predominantly against government, diplomatic, think-tank, health care and energy targets to steal valuable intellectual property.\u201d \u201cWe condemn these despicable attacks against those doing vital work to combat the coronavirus pandemic,\u201d Paul Chichester, NCSC's director of operations,\u00a0said in a statement. \u201cWorking with our allies, the NCSC is committed to protecting our most critical assets and our top priority at this time is to protect the health sector.\"Chichester also urged\u00a0\"organizations to familiarize themselves with the advice we have published to help defend their networks.\u201dThe NCSC said they are more than 95 percent certain that APT29 is part of the Russian Intelligence Services. It also assessed it is highly likely \u2013 between 80 and 90 percent \u2013\u00a0that this activity was to collect information on COVID-19 vaccine research or research into the COVID-19 virus itself.The persistent and ongoing attacks are seen by intelligence officials as an effort to steal intellectual property, rather than to disrupt research. It was unclear whether any information actually was stolen but the British center says individuals\u2019 confidential information is not believed to have been compromised.Cozy Bear, also known as \"the Dukes,\" has been identified by Washington as one of two Russian government-linked hacking groups that broke into the Democratic National Committee computer network and stole emails ahead of the 2016 presidential election. The other group is usually called Fancy Bear.The NCSC has previously warned that APT\u00a0\u2013\u00a0which stands for Advanced Persistent Threats \u2013\u00a0groups have been targeting organizations involved in both national and international COVID-19 responses. It said known targets of APT29 include British, American and Canadian vaccine research and development organizations.

Even worse, what if its flight path were sabotaged, taken over, or directed toward a friendly target?Or imagine a dismounted infantry unit is navigating rigorous, uneven terrain while under enemy fire, when their hand-held GPS location device showing friendly and enemy troop locations was cut off or fed false information?While there naturally continue to be ongoing efforts to \u201charden\u201d GPS signals against enemy interference, these types of concerning scenarios may become even more likely to take place under one dangerous scenario. The problem is what would happen if a firm\u2019s emerging 5G network is permitted to further mature into-types of networking technology.For example, a U.S.-based private sector firm by the name of Ligado is advancing a terrestrial 5G type network that may be much stronger, faster and more efficient than current GPS technology when it comes to location, navigational, networking and targeting data, among other things. However, not only is there debate regarding whether it may be a suitable alternative to GPS, but using the network could simply break up or , forcing current GPS networks to be retrofitted, adjusted or replaced, according to U.S. government officials familiar with the technology.\u201cIf Ligado\u2019s system is allowed to broadcast, it breaks up GPS and those devices that use GPS have to be retrofitted,\u201d a senior U.S. government official told Warrior. \u201cLigado uses a 10-watt signal, which is stronger than GPS. It generates too much extra energy and overloads a lot of the GPS receivers and interferes with GPS chips.\u201dLigado\u2019s terrestrial wideband wireless transmitters operate at 10 watts. They are stronger and closer-in than space-based GPS signals which weaken on their way to earth. Therefore, the introduction of Ligado could, according to technical experts and senior U.S. military observers, cause serious problems for U.S. military networks.The bottom line is this; if  to be substantially altered, or even replaced, it will open up the international market for alternative technical systems intended to perform similar functions. This could potentially create a new avenue for elements of China\u2019s widely-advancing GPS alternative system, called the BeiDou Navigation Satellite System. The Chinese already operate BeiDou and routinely launch satellites as part of a decided global effort to rival GPS.Should major adjustments, or even replacements to GPS be required, a wide range of alternative software, chips, computer networks and satellite technologies would become available options on the global market. This potential phenomenon is exactly what concerns U.S. military weapons developers in charge of developing and sustaining GPS systems.\u201cThere is no need to put GPS at risk. Mid-band spectrum for 5G exists, and DOD is working with industry on a dynamic spectrum sharing framework. Ligado\u2019s proposal is unnecessary. Ligado\u2019s proposed network lacks the bandwidth, power or global ecosystem to deliver robust 5G services. The only beneficiaries are Ligado shareholders,\u201d a DoD  reads.While Ligado\u2019s technology, which relies upon a land-based 5G network using Mobile Satellite Service Band, is not yet integrated or fully operational, the prospect of it being integrated into U.S. markets has caused great concern among U.S. military leaders. Specifically, an FCC approval of Ligado\u2019s technical initiatives has inspired a range of Congressional and U.S. military decision-makers to request that Ligado\u2019s network not be allowed to move forward for national security reasons. Simply, it would introduce serious new risks thattechnologies could infiltrate the global technical communications market, which of course includes the United States, NATO and other allied systems.\u201cIf BeiDou gets into our military systems, it could provide false timing or bad position information,\u201d the senior U.S. government official explained. \u201cIt would allow nefarious Chinese technology to infiltrate U.S. systems along the supply chain to include command and control systems and computer networks.\u201dAdded to the complexity of this predicament is that China continues to make rapid and previously unprecedented progress developing new Space War technology. For example,  recently fired off a new variant of its Long March 11 long-range carrier rocket intended to launch new, heavier payload satellites with greater thrust and a wider, taller form factor.Ligado, however, explains that its satellite network brings unprecedented advantages to U.S. satellite networks, which of course could include military applications as well, especially given the pace at which U.S. military weapons developers are increasing integrating commercial technology.\"The Ligado SkyTerra 1 satellite provides coverage and capacity that can be dynamically allocated in response to emergency situations or for any additional bandwidth needs. Advanced ground-based beamforming capabilities enable flexible management of network resources, forming hundreds of beams when and where they are needed throughout North America,\" Ligado states on its .Ligado further explains some additional technical reasons why its networks may exceed the capacities of current GPS, potentially inspiring a new competition for military satellite technology.\"The Ligado satellite network leverages lower mid-band spectrum, which is not only less susceptible to rain fade and blockage from dense foliage, but can also be tightly integrated with terrestrial networks to deliver seamless satellite and terrestrial coverage,\" Ligado says.However, the senior official explained that while contractors supporting the U.S. market could be vigilant regarding what kinds of technologies or systems are integrated, the subcontracting process is often so detailed, small-scale and elaborate that it could make things difficult, if not impossible to track. In fact, BeiDou elements are already in use in some commercial U.S. technologies.\u201cThe FCC has not banned the use of BeiDou systems in things like some cellphones and computer chips. It is not being used in U.S. military equipment, but the threat could easily come up,\u201d the U.S. official explained.Some members of Congress are expressing concern as well. In fact, in recent years, \u00a0Congressional leaders have already voiced concern regarding the possibility that Chinese-engineered parts might be making their way into some U.S. weapons systems. This is exactly the kind of thing that caused concern among those aware of the FCC\u2019s decision regarding Ligado. China already has a well-known and documented history of attempted cyber intrusions into U.S. networks and computer systems.

I'm Martha MacCallum in New York. And this is a fast-moving \"Story\" tonight. A lot of breaking news for you this evening.And a rapidly changing landscape for the 2020 election. The President canceled the Jacksonville portion of the Republican National Convention when he came out to speak to the press today.Also, we've got some brand new polling numbers for you from Fox polling that show that the President trails Joe Biden in the battleground states of Michigan, Minnesota and Pennsylvania, as we are about 100 days out from the election.Mr. Trump was in a similar position, though, we should point out back in 2016, and after his very surprising victory that year there was a lot of talk in the country about who these voters in this silent majority in America could be? Watch this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Trump voters were long-suffering; analysts say often silenced.GREG MYTROSEVICH, OHIO TRUMP VOTER: A lot of people kept quiet about a lot of things.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: So you don't say it in the polls, you don't say it to anybody else, but you show up and in the voting booth you go Trump.JOHN BRABENDER, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST: They're not answering the phone and telling people publicly they're voting for Donald Trump.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: Could some new numbers tonight from the libertarian think tank, the Cato Institute suggests that Americans are still, in fact even more so now, keeping their politics to themselves. Look at these numbers. 62 percent say that today's climate prevents them from talking about what they believe with anybody. By a large margin, those who identify, though, as very liberal. This is the group who feels the most free to speak out among friends, family, whatever, about their politics.So what exactly does this tell us about the state of the 2020 race? And what is America's growing frustration with cancel culture as an adjunct to that tell us? Marc Thiessen and Marie Harf are here to debate tonight.Also, as Bret mentioned, my exclusive interview this evening with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who just delivered a blistering message to China's communist leadership, calling on the Chinese people to perhaps consider a different path than the communist government that leads them. We're going to break that down and talk to him about exactly what he said about that.That, as China says they are not going to leave the embassy in Houston. We will get for the first time the Secretary of State to respond to them, digging in their heels at that embassy in moments.Then after that, K.T. McFarland is here with her analysis of the Pompeo interview. What's - are we in a cold war with China now? Is China been a failed experiment since 1979? All that with Katie.But we start tonight with Marc Thiessen, American Enterprise Institute Scholar and Marie Harf, Executive Director of Serve America PAC. Both are Fox News Contributors. Great to have both of you here tonight, Marie and Marc.It strikes me every time we have anyone on from the Trump campaign, we show them the latest numbers. Tonight we just showed everybody the latest numbers from Michigan, Minnesota and Pennsylvania. And they always say, look, we don't care. The polls aren't right. There's a lot of secret Trump voters out there, which we saw in a Monmouth poll last week in Pennsylvania. But Marc, it makes it very difficult to gauge where the country is at right now.MARC THIESSEN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Yes. Well, they probably overstated, especially these new Fox News polls show a big gap. It's probably not as big a gap as the polls show. So I don't think Democrats should get too excited about it.But I think that - and questionably there are secret Trump voters. In fact, there was a poll - Monmouth poll in Pennsylvania, that 57 percent of the voters there were pretty sure that some of their neighbors were planning to vote for Trump, but weren't saying it.And there's a reason for that. There's the cancel culture as it has taken hold in a way it has in recent months. I mean, think about this. Is it more or less hospitable environment for a Trump supporter to express their support for the president now than it was four months ago? I think not. So, I think that - I think there are a lot of people who won't tell a pollster that they're supporting Trump and - but are really going to vote for him in the ballot box.MACCALLUM: I think it's fascinating. And when you look at that number, 62 percent say that they do not want to share their political feelings with anybody. And back in 2017, three years ago, that number was at 58 percent. So we've seen increase, Marie, in the people in the country who are just saying, I'm not going to talk about it. I'm keeping my decision to myself.MARIE HARF, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Yes, Martha. And every Democrat, I know is running like Joe Biden is 10 points behind for this exact reason. People were very confident in 2016 that Hillary Clinton would win. We know there was a hidden Trump voter then in many of these swing states that the Fox News poll spoke to today like Michigan or Pennsylvania, where Donald Trump won by very little in 2016.So Democrats are worried about this. They really want to act like they're running from behind. I think these numbers do concern the Trump team, though. And I also think it's a really polarized time in our country. I mean, there are people on the other side of the aisle who've told me that Democrats hate America, and they hate Christianity. And that kind of language, even four or five years ago wasn't really out there. So our country is really deeply divided. We see that every day and it's a real problem. I don't know how to fix it. There's no easy answer.MACCALLUM: Yes. I want you to take a look at some of these other numbers, because they are disturbing. I mean, let's pull up this one. 32 percent worry about their jobs, because if their political opinions become known, they're concerned that they could lose their job.Look at this next one. Do you think it's OK to fire someone who supports Trump or Biden? In other words, if at your job it became known that you had given money to Joe Biden or who had given money to Trump, they support firing you. 50 percent of those who consider themselves very liberal, Marc - I mean, just think about this. So they support - they think that person should be fired from their company, that's a very disturbing number.THIESSEN: Well, it's insane and the reality is--MACCALLUM: I don't know what country--THIESSEN: --that it just show how polarized our country has become. But let's keep in mind - that I agree with Marie that there are some Republicans who say things that are overwrought about Democrats like saying that they don't love America. I condemn that.But the reality is, if you look at that poll, Republicans are more worried - there are more Republicans who are worried about expressing their views than Democrats by 25-point margin. The only group that feels that it's - that has - a majority feel confident about it, saying what they what they believe are staunch liberals.And the reason for that is, because there really isn't a penalty for being a liberal or for expressing staunch liberal views. You're not going to get in trouble at work for saying Black Lives Matter. You will get in trouble for saying blue lives matter. There will be repercussions for that. So I think there is - this cancel culture is going after the Right in a way that it's not over the Left. And we should condemn it whether it goes after conservatives or liberals.MACCALLUM: Yes. I also thought that deeper in that number, the 62 percent, who say that they don't feel comfortable talking about who they support politically, 59 percent of independents said that. So - I mean, these are the people who elect presidents and we don't know, which side they're on when you look at that number. But 59 percent of independents, Marie, said that they did not want to discuss who they will vote for or who they support.HARF: Yes, these numbers are really interesting, and I agree, disturbing in many ways. And Donald Trump as an election strategy hasn't gone after independents. He's really tripled down on his base. We've seen that with his rhetoric and his policies. And so, I don't know where those independents will break.In the polling we've seen from Fox and others, they're breaking towards Democrats and they certainly broke towards Democrats in 2018.MACCALLUM: That's interesting.HARF: But cancel culture is on both sides. Right? Like I'm not on Twitter--MACCALLUM: Is it?HARF: --because I was bullied off of it by conservatives. So it's on both sides and it's not good wherever it is.MACCALLUM: Yes.THIESSEN: Get back on Twitter, Marie, no one should believe you. I won't stand for it.MACCALLUM: It's disgusting what happens these days there.HARF: Thank you.MACCALLUM: Thank you very much, guys. Marie, Marc, great to have you. Lots more to talk to you about, but we'll pick it up next time. Thank you for being here tonight.So China digs in its heels now. This is a reflection of the burning of documents at that consulate in Houston. Now they say they're not going to leave the United States. So we asked Secretary of State Pompeo what he plans to do about that? Next.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MIKE POMPEO, SECRETARY OF STATE: Securing our freedoms from the Chinese Communist Party is the mission of our time, and America is perfectly positioned to lead it because our founding principles give us that opportunity.(END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)MACCALLUM: Are China and United States at a crossroads that could lead us into another Cold War?

The consul in Houston says that they do not have plans to leave that consulate right now. What's your response to that?POMPEO: While everyone knows the rules for diplomats. You're only permitted to be there in a diplomatic status with the consent of the host nation. And so, I'm confident, we've had private conversations as well.I'm very confident that we'll proceed in a way that makes clear that it's not OK to use your diplomats to engage in industrial espionage. It's not OK to steal intellectual property. It's not OK to engage in those kind of behaviors. That's the reason we did it. We did it to protect the American people. And we're going to make sure that that happens.MACCALLUM: I guess, the question - they say that you're - that United States is abandoning the Vienna Convention and also violating the China- U.S. consular treaty. You, obviously, think that they've already violated both of those. But literally, physically, what if they say, we will not leave, what will the United States do?POMPEO: Yes. Martha, I'm not going to speculate. We're going to make sure that we protect the American people. President Trump began to talk about this threat back in 2015 in this campaign, and you're seeing his administration begin to do the things that will lead to make sure that the American people are safe and secure.And that the jobs that depend on American intellectual property aren't lost to theft from Chinese diplomats that sit in a place in Houston, Texas with great access to American scientific knowhow and business value.MACCALLUM: There is discussion that China may retaliate by asking us to leave one of the six embassies that we have in China. We also have one in Hong Kong. And it looks like Chengdu and potentially Wuhan are at the top of that list. Will we be vacating any of our embassies in China, Mr. Secretary?POMPEO: Martha, let's go back to first principles. The first principles are this, for 40 plus years now - and this is why I'm at the Nixon Library today. For 40 plus years, America has turned the other cheek while we've watched the Chinese Communist Party engage in activity that's fundamentally not fair to the American people, it's not reciprocal for the American people and it doesn't have the transparency we need, so that we can engage with China in a way that's fair for our people and provide security for people. That's what we're aiming to do.And so this decision about the consulate that was made is consistent with all - whole bunch of other actions that we have already taken. A whole bunch more that we're going to continue to do until we get the change.I talked about President Nixon saying that the important thing was that we could induce change from China. That's the mission set the President Trump has set our course on. So whether it is the indictments that have been handed down by the Department of Justice, or the decisions we've made with respect to Hong Kong.All of those are aimed at inducing change inside the Chinese Communist Party for the simple purpose of protecting the American people. And so the Chinese government will get to make its decisions about our diplomats their inside of China. We will make sure that we do right by the American people.MACCALLUM: So, I mean, it sounds like you're saying that this is a very ruptured relationship. And, if I'm reading too much in to take from that, but it - we may, yes, we may pull out of embassies in China that might be part of this process.POMPEO: Yes, Martha I talked today about actions, not words. I was in Honolulu, just a few weeks back. I met with Yang Jiechi. We had a wonderful discussion. But in the end, what matters are actions, the things that make sure that we protect the American people. President Trump's trade deal was a good first effort. That the Phase 1 trade deal is important. If we get that right, that'd be the beginning of a basis for us to expand a fair and reciprocal set of trading relationships.But look at our diplomatic relationship today. They have many more diplomats here in the United States than we have inside of China. And their diplomats here in the United States have much more freedom of movement, and much more access that our diplomats do in China - inside of China.MACCALLUM: Yes.POMPEO: All we're asking, Martha, all we're asking is we want it to be fair and reciprocal. And that's the aim of President Trump. It's what we're going to accomplish.MACCALLUM: So you talked about the sanctions that we have, there's military exercises that have also become somewhat more prominent in the region. We have two hackers that just received indictments. Are we in a Cold War right now with China? And if we're not, it certainly looks like we are.POMPEO: General Secretary Xi has clearly taken actions that are aggressive and broken promises that are central to how great power nations behave. Remember he made a promise back in 2015 in the Rose Garden with President Obama. He said he wouldn't militarize the South China Sea. You can go look, there's now significant military activity there by China.He made a promise to the people of Britain, to the people of Hong Kong that they would have a 50-year deal of one country two systems. He busted it. He broke it. United States is simply demanding that if the Chinese Communist Party wants to be considered in the League of Nations that have great power and great roles and great importance, they've got to behave according to promises that they make and the rules that have been set out for sovereign nations to preserve freedom for their own people.That's what we're seeking to see happen. Label it what you must. But President Trump understands that the previous administrations, both Republican and Democrat alike, turned the other cheek for an awfully long time.MACCALLUM: Yes.POMPEO: And resulted in a real imbalance in the relationship between the United States and China. We aim to fix it.MACCALLUM: I spoke to trade advisor Peter Navarro on this program several weeks back. And I said is the trade deal basically over? And he said, yes, it is. He walked that back a bit. But, it appears that it is. Is that fair to say at this point?POMPEO: No, I'm hopeful that the Phase 1 trade deal we've complied with by both sides. The Chinese Communist Party tells us that they're going to fulfill their commitments. We have every expectation that they will, and our task will be to verify that they've done so. We hope that they do. And if they do, perhaps there'll be an opportunity to build on that.And what we're not going to let happen is what we've allowed to happen before, is that they make a set of promises, they make a commitment, like the Phase 1 trade deal and then they try and they do a little bit and America calls it good enough. President Trump is not going to permit that to happen. We're going to hold them accountable for the promises that they make, MarthaMACCALLUM: President Trump just said moments ago, that that trade deal is not as important to him anymore as it once was.POMPEO: I understand that. I completely understand it. When you see what the Chinese Communist Party has done to our country and to the world with their failure to live up to another set of promises they made to the world about their responsibility if a pandemic began to break out of their country, the cover up that took place. You can absolutely understand why a trade deal like the Phase 1 trade deal no longer ranks first among all the various issues we have with the Chinese Communist Party.MACCALLUM: Yes.POMPEO: We've seen across the world, hundreds of thousands of deaths. Trillions of dollars in economic destruction wrought on this world, because the Chinese Communist Party failed to live up to some basic commitments to the world.MACCALLUM: You made a very strong appeal to the Chinese people in this speech, basically calling on them to call for a new form of government in China. Are you encouraging them towards regime change? And you said that we would encourage and empower - engage and empower. How will we do that? What - how do we play that role? What will that look like?POMPEO: Martha, I talked about several things. One of which is there are 1.4 billion Chinese people. And what I wanted to make clear in my remarks today is we want good things for them. They've raised hundreds of millions of people out of destitute, poverty, we think that's a good thing. We're not trying to contain the prosperity for the people of China. We're simply trying to preserve freedom for the people of the United States of America. That is the American task.President Trump, when he was sworn in, and I - when I was sworn in as Secretary of State, that's the promise that we made. And so what we are concerned about is not holding China down, but making sure that we all get this right, so that we can have a prosperous economy here in the United States of America, and that we can hold them accountable in ways that preserve and secure freedom for the American people. That's the mission.So when I talk about the Chinese people, I'm talking about making sure that they have the opportunity to participate on a fair and reciprocal basis, in the same way that we expect the American people will.MACCALLUM: I guess - but if I'm the government of China listening to what you're saying, it sounds like you are encouraging the people of China to rise up, to create a different - to push for a different form of government. And we see what's happening in Taiwan where they have a genuine fear that they might be invaded or attacked by the Mainland.You look at what's happening in Hong Kong, where they are experiencing a diminishment all the time of their independence. So those are very provocative words to the Chinese government to say we want your people to push for a new form of government.MACCALLUM: Martha, that's not what I said. Go back and reread what I talked about. This was a speech about the American perspective and the need for a global alliance of freedom loving nations. This is what we're demanding.We know that the Chinese Communist Party has a different system. They still have obligations to live up to promises, promises even that they make to their own people. Our task is to preserve freedom and security for our people. And we know we need partners to do that. We know we need friends.I was in London and Copenhagen just the last two days, talking to them about this. The whole world is beginning to see that when you bend the knee to China, that bad things happen to your own country. So I have every expectation what the whole world, indeed freedom loving people all around the world must demand that the Chinese Communist Party live up to the commitments that it makes.MACCALLUM: You talked a moment ago about - your obvious concerns about this virus and the origins of this virus. Today in the United States we passed 4 million cases, which is obviously a milestone that is difficult for everybody to hear. Nancy Pelosi, the Speaker of the House said that the President calls it the China virus. She said that she is calling it the Trump virus as a result of the President's handling of this virus. What do you say to that, sir?POMPEO: One ought not to make a virus that has had such devastation in United States a political matter. What one ought to do is to call out the people and places that resulted in this virus getting out of Wuhan, China. There's no mistake. There's lots to dispute about the precise origin of this virus. We'd love to know the answers to that. But sadly, the Chinese Communist Party has prevented that.But we know it came from Wuhan. We know they closed down Hubei Province, but didn't close down traveled to the rest of the world. That has caused enormous harm to the United States of America. So this is indeed a china virus. It emanated from there. Make no mistake about it. It is not political. It is factual.MACCALLUM: Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, thank you very much. Good to have you with us this evening. Thank you for your time, sir.POMPEO: Martha. Thank you.MACCALLUM: Former Deputy National Security Advisor K.T. McFarland on where all of this is leading the United States and China. Next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)MACCALLUM: Strong word tonight from Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. He says essentially, Richard Nixon was right when he wrote in 1967 that the world cannot be safe until China changes. And now the United States faces that turning point once again, here he is moments ago.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)POMPEO: --talked about President Nixon saying that the important thing was that we could induce change from China. That's the mission set the President Trump has set our course on. So whether it is the indictments that have been handed down by the Department of Justice, or the decisions we've made with respect to Hong Kong.All of those are aimed at inducing change inside the Chinese Communist Party for the simple purpose of protecting the American people.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: Former deputy national security advisor for the Trump administration. K.T. McFarland joins me now. She's the author of Revolution: Trump, Washington, and We, the People.\" K.T., good to see you tonight. Your thoughts on with the secretary of state had to say there.K.T. MCFARLAND, AUTHOR, \"REVOLUTION\": You know, this is a really significant interview you just had with him and it's a really significant event. And here's why it's important.Forty-nine years ago this month, Richard Nixon, President Nixon directed his national security advisor to go to China and open up relations with China, to bring China into the world.I was a young staff aide to Richard Nixon and Henry Kissinger at that time. I remember this as if it was yesterday.And that set American foreign policy with China in a certain direction for 50 years. And President Nixon was right. He said we will induce them to change. Our thoughts, Republican and Democrat alike was that as China modernizes, as China comes into the world, as they develop a middle class, they will be an open society, an open economy, an open society, but that's not how it turned out.The Chinese in fact have exploited that. And that's why Pompeo was at the Nixon Library today, because he is indicating we now have a reverse. We are now -- we are now acknowledging the fact that the Chinese have stolen intellectual property rights, have militarized the South China Sea, have unleashed a bio weapon onto the world, have practiced wolf diplomacy and so, we, the Trump administration with the United States we're going to have a very different approach to China going forward and that's exactly what he was telling you.And, Martha, I also thought it was interesting when he mentioned to you that he was in Copenhagen, he was in London.MACCALLUM: Yes.MCFARLAND: And he was talking to America's allies about getting the coalition together so we together stand up to China.MACCALLUM: And what does China's coalition look like?MCFARLAND: China has never had very many allies. I mean, their vision of the world and the world that they really want to impose on the rest of us is China is the superpower, China is going to be, they think, the world's major economic political, military, diplomatic power. And then China will determine what everybody else does.And you step out of line for a minute, you try to -- you try to challenge China, you try to go against China and you get crushed. The Australians, for example, the Australians had the temerity to say let's just investigate what happens with the pandemic, with the coronavirus and China turned around and tried to crush their exports, their barley and wheat exports to China. China has, they play with really elbows out sharp. There is President Trump says they are ruthless in their negotiations.MACCALLUM: Yes. Well, I mean, they've essentially someone say they've been buying friends in Latin America, in Asia, in Africa, we know helping with aid and all of that. So, it will be interesting to see if there is a cold war period that we are entering how everything lines up.Secretary Pompeo said we must engage and empower the Chinese people. And he was very careful to say that he is not calling for regime change in China, and yet, you can see these seeds of rebellion in Hong Kong wanting to stay independent, and in Taiwan saying to the rest the world, you know wake up.MCFARLAND: Yes.MACCALLUM: You know, we could be invaded.MCFARLAND: Yes. And I thought that was also really significant what he told you, because he was sort of talking about regime change but he really wasn't talking about regime change.I think that the pandemic, Hong Kong, the South China Sea, these has been a slap in the face in the world and I think it's a wake-up call to the rest of the world. And so, we are not criticizing China, the Chinese people. We are criticizing the Chinese Communist Party which runs China right now which is accumulated more and more power and is a dictatorship, really of President Xi Jinping who is now going to be president for life of China.MACCALLUM: It's fascinating to watch. And it reminds me so much of the Cold War with Russia, we're even in the space race.MCFARLAND: Yes.MACCALLUM: This time it's to Mars, the Chinese against the United States.So, K.T., thank you very much.MCFARLAND: There you have it.MACCALLUM: Great to see you as always.MCFARLAND: Thank you, Martha. Thank you.MACCALLUM: So, the CDC has just released new guidance on how to reopen our schools saying that COVID-19 poses low risk to school age children echoing the sentiment of President Trump today. We are going to talk to a panel of educators with decades of teaching experience about what they think this should look like when we come back.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Fortunately, the data shows that children are at lower risk from the China virus very substantially. When children do contract the virus, they often have only very mild symptoms or none at all.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: Fox News alert tonight. The CDC has just released their guidance for reopening schools this fall. The headline according to the CDC, this virus poses, quote, \"low risks to students and teachers,\" therefore face masks and social distancing are the best defense.Quote, \"the best available evidence from countries that have opened schools indicates that COVID-19 poses low risk to school age children. Reopening schools creates opportunity to invest in the education, well-being and future of one of America's greatest assets, our children, while taking every precaution to protect students, teachers, staff, and all their families.\"Tonight, we are joined by three teachers, all with different opinions about whether students can safely return to the classroom. Leigha Phillips teaches high school English, Krista Herrin teaches kindergarten and first grade special education, and Phil Strunk teaches middle school social studies.Great to have all of you with us today.Krista, let me start with you, teaching kindergartners, how do you feel about the fact that, you know, they say some very young children don't even need to do the mask part necessarily?KRISTA HERRIN, KINDERGARTEN & FIRST GRADE TEACHER: I have a lot of concerns going into the school year. Kindergartners love to share, they love to share toys, they love to share hugs and they love to share germs. And I think it's going to be really difficult for us to keep masks on kids and social distance in a small classroom. I don't have any windows in my room, so I'm just pretty nervous about how things are going to go this school year.MACCALLUM: So, how do you feel though about the statistics that show that it's -- you know, the transmission is very low among children and that the risk according to what we see in other countries appears to be very low in terms of -- even studies that have been done that show that their transmission to other people appears to be very low, that doesn't reassure you?HERRIN: It's reassuring but at the same time, here in the United States, we shut down before we had any chance to spread germs in the school. So that's my big concern is, we don't know. I mean, there are other countries that are showing that, but I just worry when we get closer to the fall and the winter with more illness, that we are going to see a lot more illness.MACCALLUM: Phil, what do you think about those guidelines?PHIL STRUNK, MIDDLE SCHOOL TEACHER: Regarding the guidelines whenever I look at them, I am, you know, it's comforting to see that students under age 10 we're not really seeing a high transmission but it's the number for students over age 10.The New York Times came out with an article that said we're spreading it -- or sorry -- 10-year-olds are spreading it at about the same age as adults. We are working in schools now where like the state of Pennsylvania, that a nurse to student ratio is 1500 to one. That guideline was set back in the 40s. In my home state of Virginia, it's over 800 to one. And the CDC guidelines are 750 to one.MACCALLUM: Yes.STRUNK: We're not exactly set right now to be able to combat this whole currently uncurable virus.MACCALLUM: But Phil, let me ask you this. Because, you know, looking at a chart here that shows the flu deaths in the country. So right now, we're at 30 children under 15. Thirty children under 15 have died, most of them had complicating factors and obviously no one wants to see any child die from any disease in this country.STRUNK: Sure.MACCALLUM: If we can prevent it we of course want to do everything we can. However, the average over the past 10 years of children who died because of the flu every year is 511. And we do not shut schools down from, you know, November to January every year because of the flu.STRUNK: Right. You're absolutely right, we don't shut it down during the flu. One of my big concerns right now is students passing it on to educators like myself. I'm coming home to a wife and we are expecting our first child this November.The CDC has also pointed out that women that are in their third trimester of pregnancy are at huge risk and that's where she's going to be. I think of teachers that have taught with that are overcoming cancer and a lot of other illnesses. And for me, you know, I want the economy open just like everybody else, I want to eat meals with my friends. I want to be able to stand next to a student whenever they're struggling with something.I don't think you're going to find any teachers who are going to say I don't want to be back in school. But for me, my value on human life is much higher than the need to currently open up the education system in an in-person format. Schools didn't close last spring, you know, teachers continue to work tirelessly.MACCALLUM: Yes.STRUNK: And we'll continue to work tirelessly this fall.MACCALLUM: Leigha, what do you think?LEIGHA PHILLIPS, HIGH SCHOOL ENGLISH TEACHER: I mean, I agree with a lot of what they are saying especially if I were working with the young kids, I'd be concerned. I've got a nine, four, and 2-year-old, and I know that keeping their hands to themselves and keeping masks on can be hard so I really empathize especially with our elementary school teachers, middle schoolers aren't much different in all honesty.Just like Phil said, I am worried about my high school kids transmitting it whether it's between themselves, giving it to me and me taking at home, me giving it to my elderly grandma. So, I would love to be in school and I would love to see a hybrid work but that takes a lot of work and a lot of resources that not all districts have and are able to do in such a short time.MACCALLUM: I mean, we've had, you know, the whole summer, or really since March to be adapting to this, there's been hundreds of millions of dollars that went out in the CARE Act to help schools get ready for this and prepare.One of the things that President Trump said had to do with, you know, reallocating money if the schools choose not to open in the face of these guidelines, here's what he said about that.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: If schools are not reopened, the funding should go to parents to send their child to public-private, charter, religious, or homeschool of their choice.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: So, Krista, some schools will open, should parents have the option to use the tax dollars that are allocated to their child to send them someplace else that is open if they want them in school?HERRIN: I think that it's a parent's choice as to where they want their child to go and what they feel would be the best for their family. But I know that more public educators they want the best for what their student needs and they want them to be safe. And so, no matter what the outcome is, the community needs to come together and support the teachers that are trying to do their best.MACCALLUM: What about remote learning, Phil? We've heard a lot that over all, especially for children in urban environments, in inner-city environments, that remote learning has been a failure.STRUNK: Yes, remote learning is going to be challenging no matter what, and I think the other teachers on this panel would agree with me whenever I'd say none of us would suggest remote learning or anything like that because it's easier or better for students, we all know being in a classroom with kids is what's the best option.MACCALLUM: Yes.STRUNK: But again, we're facing an unprecedented time with this pandemic that's killing thousands of people. At this point, I think in the interest of safety, that kind of has to take the top priority, that way we can bring more students back into the classroom in the safe format.MACCALLUM: What about, Leigha, before I let you go, quickly if you can, you know, these studies that show that kids are actually they are in more danger in school than they are staying home. There's instances of abuse, there's difficulties at home, there are things that you don't pick up on necessarily if you don't get to see that child in school every day, does that danger outweigh the virus?PHILLIPS: It's a hard question --(CROSSTALK)STRUNK: I think, you know, they aren't --MACCALLUM: Leigha, if you can. Thanks.PHILLIPS: Yes.STRUNK: Sorry.PHILLIPS: I'm not sure you can weigh -- I'm not sure you can weigh what's more important, a life or a life filled with pain and abuse. I mean, it's a valid point, and it's a concerning point. I know my colleagues and I are all concerned with, but I think there gets to be a point when society and the community has placed too much of a burden on schools to be the police of what's happening, to be the counselors, to do all of these different things.I think that employers, I think the community, and I think all stakeholders need to have an impact on that and need to step up and kind of fill in the gaps where kids are going to struggleMACCALLUM: Yes.PHILLIPS: -- because their life isn't worth it.(CROSSTALK)MACCALLUM: A lot of -- a lot of people are very concerned, you know, if they stay home for another semester or God forbid to the whole school year, all of the loss of learning could be devastating, it could really set a lot of these kids back for a long time.So, I thank you all for your dedication and for sharing your thoughts with us on this today. Leigha, Krista, and Phil, all the best to you as you head forward towards the school year.PHILLIPS: Thank you.MACCALLUM: Thank you very much.STRUNK: Thank you, Martha.MACCALLUM: Thank you.So, coming up, there has been a lot of talk about a violent crime surging in Chicago and New York, but the city of Detroit is also seeing a 29 percent increase in homicides this year. Detroit based Pulitzer Prize winning journalist Charlie LeDuff on whether the feds need to protect his city, next.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: Well, I'm going to do something, that I can tell you. Because we're not going to let New York, and Chicago, and Philadelphia, and Detroit, and Baltimore and all of these -- all cleaned. It's a mess. We're not going to let this happen in our country.(END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: Chicago should be calling us and so should Philadelphia and Detroit and others, to go in and really help them. Because when you're losing many people a weekend, many, many people, you see the same numbers as I do. When you're losing these people, they should call us and they should say come on in.And it's incredible to me but they're not doing it. At some point, they will. At some point we may have no other choice but to go in.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: So, with violent crime on the rise now in Detroit as well, President Trump hinting that it could be among the cities that receive some help from federal officers under the new Operation Legend that was announced yesterday.Homicides there are up 29 percent, and you know, good estimates. I think our next guests will tell us it's higher than that. Nonfatal shootings are up 52 percent over the same period last year, and over the weekend, there were 33 shooting incidents leaving 26 people injured and seven dead.Charlie LeDuff has covered Detroit extensively, he's a Pulitzer Prize winning journalist and says that the increase in crime is historical. He is the author of \"S Show\" there you go. \"This Country is Collapsing but the Ratings Are Great.\"Charlie, always good to see you. Thank you very much for being here.CHARLIE LEDUFF, AUTHOR, \"SH*TSHOW\": The title is still true, Martha.MACCALLUM: So, is the -- what's the answer here? Who needs to come in to help the situation in Detroit, what's the mayor doing about it?LEDUFF: What are they doing about it? First of all, we've had five mass shootings in two weeks, two quadruples, two quintuples, and a nine tuple. So, I don't know what this package is that the president is sending. Are you sending 10 agents? A 100 agents? A thousand? Because our own chief of police says he needs another thousand cops at least.So, we've entered into agreements with them -- they haven't really work what we have task force. ATF, FBI, DEA, the relationship between the Detroit police and the DEA is rotten, it's done. The chief threw them out because of an informant in January who went on a rampage and killed six people. So, I'd like to see some specifics. They had a relationship, now they don't and it's a political year so, I don't even -- I'm not even buying this.MACCALLUM: What's life like now in Detroit for people who live there?LEDUFF: What's it's like?MACCALLUM: Yes.LEDUFF: They are scared and they are angry and they want help. And I don't -- nobody seriously thinks you should defund the police because as we talked about before, we've already done it and look what's happening. And remember, in the next couple of days, those $600 super unemployment checks run out, then what happens?MACCALLUM: So, you heard the president, you know, he talks about sending help. Right?LEDUFF: Yes.MACCALLUM: You say that the police aren't doing their job because they are afraid of the ramifications, you talk about sending in state troopers. You know, what do you think having lived there and worked there and watched all of this, is there a solution that's going to make people safer on the streets?LEDUFF: I think we're in for a slog here, I think you know it and I think the country knows it, the police do do their jobs, there's not enough police to do it and some are afraid to do it. But just last week they pulled 106 guns off of 117 arrestees. Guns are everywhere, what could the governor do? She's not even talking about it, right? She's busy tweeting with the president.Madam, put the state police on the major thoroughfares in the city, seven- mile, six-mile, McNichols, Finco (Ph), five-mile, Telegraph, let them patrol the main boulevards so the police can be in the neighborhoods. That's one way to do it. We've got more state troopers than the president is sending federal agents.MACCALLUM: So, she's way ahead in job performance, she's at 64 percent. President Trump is at 45 percent in Michigan, what do you say about that before we go?LEDUFF: Well, we don't have a very rabid media in this state. You, I think we'll all notice she's got a lot of softball questions. She doesn't get good marks for the nursing homes, she hasn't addressed that. The Senate today voted to take COVID positive people out of nursing homes and have their own facilities.MACCALLUM: That's a good idea.LEDUFF: It's bipartisan. And she's threatening to veto it. And I got to go, Martha. That's all the time I have.MACCALLUM: All right, Charlie, thank you. Come back soon. Always good to talk to you. Best of luck.LEDUFF: Thank you.MACCALLUM: More of The Story coming up next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)MACCALLUM: You don't want to miss this in the latest episode of the Untold Story podcast. I had a great discussion with Hall of Fame football coach Lou Holtz of Notre Dame.
