Hope you're having a safe and healthy Fourth of July weekend. I'm Charles Payne, in for Maria Bartiromo. Coming up on \"Sunday Morning Futures\": (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: The courage of those patriots on July 4, 1776 -- the American republic stands today as the greatest, most exceptional and most virtuous nation in the history of the world. (END VIDEO CLIP) PAYNE: President Trump paying tribute to the founding fathers during last night's Salute to America celebration. And with less than four months to go until the election, why the president is calling mail-in voting his biggest concern heading into November. We will hear from U.S. Attorney General Bill Barr on why he says American companies with ties to China are putting short-term profits over long-term viability. Plus: Tennessee setting another single-day record for the new coronavirus cases. Senator Marsha Blackburn joins me to discuss the debate over mask mandates and whether states moved too quickly to reopen, as infection rates spike across the country. And analysis from Gordon Chang on the reasons behind China's newly passed national security law for Hong Kong. All that and more, as we look ahead on \"Sunday Morning Futures.\" The president coming out with a strong defense of U.S. history, while taking aim at the -- quote -- \"radical left\" during a Salute to America celebration, which included a trip to Mount Rushmore and a speech on the White House lawn on July 4. For reaction, let's bring in Republican Senator Marsha Blackburn from Tennessee, who serves on the Armed Services Committee, Commerce, and Judiciary committees. Senator, thanks for joining us. I just want to get your thoughts on those speeches, again, a serious focus on where America has come from, those who helped build America into the greatest country in the world, and a positive look to the future for all Americans. SEN. MARSHA BLACKBURN (R-TN): Oh, Charles, I thought the speech was absolutely one of the best that he has given. And how appropriate that he reminded the American people that we are unique, and that you can bet on hope, or you can bet on fear, but, in this country, you have the ability to do whatever you want to do, to dream those big dreams, and make them come true. And you and I have talked in times past about how we have each put a focus on encouraging young people from underserved areas. And wouldn't it be fabulous to have this national garden, where people could go and be inspired and say, I want to do something that is going to be significant for my country? PAYNE: Yes, it's interesting, because the White House just announcing that they do have plans for a national garden that could possibly open July 4, 2026. The media taking shots, saying it was an arbitrary and random list of Americans. I'm not sure what's so random about John Adams, Susan B. Anthony, Henry Clay, Daniel Boone, Davy Crockett, Franklin Doug -- Frederick Douglass, Amelia Earhart, Martin Luther King Jr., Abraham Lincoln, Douglas MacArthur, Betsy Ross, Harriet Beecher Stowe, Ronald Reagan, Jackie Robinson, Booker T. Washington, Harriet Tubman, George Washington, the Wright brothers, and the list goes on. That sounds like a pretty good list and a pretty good foundation of what shaped and formed who we are today. BLACKBURN: I think it's a great foundation, because you know what? Those of us that studied history and appreciate history can tick through you the list and tell you something of significance that each of those individuals did or said that inspired us in some way. So, as they are putting this list together, I think it is really wonderful. And how appropriate. You're talking about Frederick Douglass and Susan B. Anthony, and this is the year we're celebrating the 19th Amendment and women getting the right to vote. That is going to be August 18, 2020, the centennial celebration. PAYNE: And the speech itself, particularly the one at Mount Rushmore, when the president said that the founding fathers launched a revolution in pursuit of justice, equality, liberty, and prosperity, it kind of reminded me of \"Hamilton,\" right? The biggest media event over the weekend is how many people have watched \"Hamilton.\" And the same folks that said that this is an amazing play, with an inspiring message, found racism, division in these kind of words from President Trump. So, I just can't understand why, at some point, even the media should let their guards down, and let Americans celebrate where we have come and how we have gotten here so fast. BLACKBURN: That is so true. And we want to make certain -- and the president spoke to this. We do not need to erase our nation's history. It is all there, the good, the bad, the ugly, the inspirational, the achievement, the overcoming, the pride that people should take in the fact that they have been able to achieve and do and be. There are millions of people from all across the globe that seek to come to the United States every single year, because they are escaping oppression and because they want to be able to achieve their dreams. And they have read about our land as a land of hope and opportunity and freedom. So, they choose to come here. I think the garden is a great idea. The president's speech was the right tone, talking about this country and this country's achievements and the achievements of our people, which is what makes which makes -- which makes our country great. You know, people felt like President Trump believed in them in 2016. Indeed, he did. PAYNE: Right. BLACKBURN: And he has proven that, and so now to say, here is where we can go with our children and grandchildren and say, this is someone who made a difference in our lives. PAYNE: Senator, I want to switch gears here a little bit. BLACKBURN: Sure. PAYNE: COVID-19 cases have been on the rise throughout the nation. And I think the most recent numbers from Tennessee show a continuing spike in those cases. So, the idea is, what do we do? We do see where masks are now being mandatory in many states that they weren't before. BLACKBURN: Yes. PAYNE: Did we open too quickly? Or was it just sort of a situation where people just were so -- have been so pent up, so cooped up, that they overindulged there. And how long do you think it will get before we're sort of back on track with reopening the nation? BLACKBURN: I think getting back on track very quickly. And here is the reason why. You are seeing people who got out there, their kids got out there, they went to protest, they went into these groups. And now what do you have? You have spikes, whether it was protests or bars or whatever. So, I have talked to a lot of moms who are saying, I have told my kids and my young adults... (LAUGHTER) BLACKBURN: ... you have to wear a mask. You have to wash your hands. PAYNE: Yes. BLACKBURN: And they know they want to get out and about. And, Charles, here's the thing. We cannot afford another lockdown in this economy -- 4.8 million jobs, the jobs report, the numbers were good. People want to go to work. They need to do it safely. They need to wear their masks. They need to wear gloves, use a face shield if they need to. They need to wash their hands. And they need to make certain that their children are -- and even if they're adults, make certain that their children are doing these same things... PAYNE: Yes. BLACKBURN: ... their grandchildren are doing it, because kids have got to get back to school. And kids have got to get back to colleges. If you are not putting kids back in colleges, you don't have young teachers coming along to help teach children. You don't have young medical students getting through medical school and then getting out to do those of residencies and practice medicine. We have to get ourselves back on track. And here's another thing, Charles. We do not want to hand the keys of this economy that is roaring back to life, we don't want to hand those keys to the Marxists and the socialists. PAYNE: We have got less than a minute to go. And I know you're passionate about these two topics. I don't know if we can give answers on both. But, of course, you share President Trump's worries about mail-in voting and the fraud associated with that. BLACKBURN: Yes. PAYNE: But something else that you have been working on with the NCAA, the NIL, name, images and likeness, you have pushed hard for this. And it looks like these student athletes are going to start having some control over their own financial futures because of who they are. BLACKBURN: When it comes to NIL, yes, I think that we have given the NCAA a deadline. If they can't get their act together, we will get it together for them. But they're going to resolve this issue. And we're going to have a standard, so that these parents and these young athletes know what to expect. Likewise, I know you're talking to Gordon in a few minutes. I have been pretty hard on the NBA about their relationship with communist China. And when it comes to dealing with that, they need to be held to account for this. And let me flip to the mail-in voting. I have served on an election commission as a citizen in service in my county. PAYNE: Right. BLACKBURN: I think that we trust our local election commissions to run those elections fair and square. PAYNE: Right. BLACKBURN: That is where the accountability needs to be. I'm very leery of mail-in voting. PAYNE: You're not the only one. Senator Marsha Blackburn, thank you very much. Well, presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden held his first news conference in 89 days this past Tuesday. Up next: President Trump on how he plans to campaign against the former vice president and the concerns that he has over of voting by mail also, as we look ahead on \"Sunday Morning Futures.\" (COMMERCIAL BREAK) PAYNE: Welcome back. With the 2020 presidential election now just 120 days away, President Trump is calling mail-in voting the single biggest threat to his reelection. He recently sat down with Maria Bartiromo for an exclusive interview about why the Democrats want to change how America votes and why he believes it's a danger to our democracy. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) TRUMP: I'm running against the Democrats, and I'm running against the media. I'm running against the radical left. I'm running against some really stupid Republicans that don't understand how good they had it, because we have some Republicans -- I'm at 95 or 96 percent with the Republican Party, but we have some people that claim to be Republicans, and they've gone crazy. And the reason is, I have defeated them all. You know, they were all my opponents, and they've never gotten over it, guys, Weaver and Schmidt, all losers. And they go out and they try buying commercials. And you say, gee, we've rebuilt our military. We've taken care of our vets. Our vets are in the best shape. You've never seen anything like with the vets, with Choice, with everything else.\u00a0 We've done such a good job. And then you add the judges and you add protecting our Second Amendment.\u00a0 And what are these guys going to do? Support Joe Biden?\u00a0 MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: No.\u00a0 \u00a0TRUMP: And, you know, because Joe has been brought way left, way, way left. They've never gotten over losing to me. It wasn't supposed to happen. And then I had another race. It was against crooked Hillary Clinton. And she's never gotten over it either.

Ultimate victory depends on our scientific preeminence rooted in the longstanding and often unspoken principles of integrity, transparency, cooperation, openness, impartiality, respect, freedom of inquiry, reciprocity and accountability to the American people.Yet these principles \u2014 and the security and integrity of America\u2019s  enterprise \u2014 are being undermined by some researchers and foreign governments that are robbing the American people of federal research dollars, new discoveries and innovations.These threats impact our public health and national security. For example, the FBI and Department of Homeland Security recently warned that the People\u2019s Republic of China was attempting to steal American vaccine and therapeutics research \u2014 an unconscionable act in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic.The Trump administration has taken decisive action to protect the U.S. research enterprise. Through the groundbreaking Joint Committee on the Research Environment (JCORE), the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy has led a year-long effort marshalling the entire research community to combat these challenges and ensure America remains the most innovative nation in the world.JCORE addresses not only direct intellectual property theft, but also the broad range of increasingly widespread and systemic attempts to subvert our research enterprise.For decades, governments have rightfully sought to attract global talent to advance their own scientific interests. However, some foreign government-sponsored talent programs \u2014 in particular some sponsored by the Chinese Communist Party \u2014 operate with the intent to import or acquire scientific and technological advancements through means that violate the integrity of the research enterprise and sometimes even violate laws.Often using certain of its more than 200 talent recruitment programs along with lucrative financial packages, the Chinese government has enticed U.S.-based scientists, researchers and students \u2014 irrespective of their country of origin \u2014 to secretly transfer or steal federally funded work.Across the world, the Chinese government has recruited at least 7,000 \u201chigh-end professionals\u201d into its talent programs. Compromised scientists sometimes operate labs in China mirroring U.S.-sponsored facilities, misappropriate research findings, and steal intellectual property.The vast majority of U.S.-based scientists, irrespective of their country of origin, operate with integrity and contribute significantly to our research enterprise. However, some have violated longstanding conflict-of-interest rules by failing to disclose foreign financing while receiving American taxpayer-funded grants, often for the same work.In one notable case, the chair of Harvard University\u2019s Chemistry Department allegedly lied to investigators about his participation in China\u2019s Thousand Talents Program, through which he established a research laboratory in Wuhan, China.Recently, 54 scientists were fired or resigned after an investigation by the National Institutes of Health uncovered violations including undisclosed financial ties to foreign governments. Ninety-three percent of those scientists received hidden funding from a Chinese institution.When such individuals break the rules, Beijing gains improper access to some of the $150 billion of annual U.S. taxpayer-funded research. These nefarious actions not only put our security at risk, but also undermine the foundational integrity of our research enterprise and risk eroding the American public\u2019s trust in researchers and research outcomes at a moment when science is needed most.The Trump administration is leading a comprehensive, enterprise-wide response equal to the threat. Just last month, President Trump issued a proclamation denying visas to certain graduate students and researchers affiliated with Chinese institutions carrying out Beijing\u2019s Military-Civil Fusion strategy. This policy will prevent the Chinese Communist Party from exploiting access to our nation\u2019s educational and research centers to advance its military development.Even before this action, the White House has coordinated over two dozen federal research and development, law enforcement, and national security agencies through JCORE to strengthen the security and integrity of our research enterprise.Over the last year, JCORE has focused its efforts on identifying the scope and scale of risks, generating guidance for federal agencies to strengthen protection of U.S. government-supported research and development against foreign government interference and exploitation, and developing recommendations for academic and research institutions.But the federal government cannot address these risks alone. That is why, through JCORE, we have gathered leaders from the private sector, academia, nonprofit and philanthropic organizations, and professional societies to ensure the collective actions we take balance the openness critical to the conduct of research with our need to protect our research enterprise.I personally have met with allies abroad and visited academic institutions across America to hear directly from those experiencing similar threats. The Trump administration is also working closely with Congress, which has shown strong bipartisan support on these issues.In President Trump, our innovators have a champion in the White House who is fiercely standing up for American values and defending our research system from foreign subversion. JCORE is at the center of this president\u2019s whole-of-nation effort to protect American interests and defend our hard-earned research.The Trump administration\u2019s commitment to honest and principled research will continue to unite, inspire and guide the American research enterprise so it remains the envy of the world.", "comment": "(70)", "topic": "OPINION", "date": " July 16"}, {"cover": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/07/156/88/AP-Vatican-Pope.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "title": "Pope scraps prepared remarks on China\u2019s security law in Hong Kong, raising concerns: report", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/world/pope-china-hong-kong-vatican", "subtitle": "Pope Francis\u00a0skipped any mention of\u00a0Hong Kong\u00a0during his weekly address last Sunday, even though the issue was reportedly included in his prepared remarks.", "keyword": "China and national Security", "website": "Fox News", "author": "Caleb Parke", "content": "\u00a0skipped any mention of\u00a0\u00a0during his weekly address Sunday, even though the issue was reportedly included in his prepared remarks.Francis omitted a paragraph on his \"attention and worries\" with regard to the semi-autonomous territory's religious liberty following  new national security law, according to an embargoed copy of the Angelus address obtained by the\u00a0.Critics said the pope is catering to the Chinese Communist Party at the expense of the Catholic faithful and pro-democracy pastors in Hong Kong, who could be extradited and tried in mainland China under the new law.Others believe it was a calculated move to air his concerns privately\u00a0as the Vatican attempts to renegotiate an agreement.While the pope stuck to his remarks on other international concerns from the window in St. Peter's Square, he completely bypassed the comments on Hong Kong.\u201cI have followed with particular attention and not without concern the development of the complex situation in Hong Kong, and I wish to show above all my heartfelt closeness to all the inhabitants of that territory,\u201d the pope's prepared comments read, according to .The paragraph also said, \u201cI hope therefore that all the people involved will know how to face the various problems with a spirit of far-sighted wisdom and authentic dialogue.

Australia also promised to give some 10,000 Hong Kongers on student and temporary visas a pathway to permanent residency.Though the Republic of Ireland is not a part of the U.K., the country remains at the top of Ko\u2019s list for a charter city since it has hosted special economic zones in the past, including the Shannon Free Trade Zone and the International Financial Services Centre (IFSC) in Dublin. But plans have not been finalized, as Ireland remains a part of the European Union. Generally, European state aid rules prevent members of the bloc from giving aid to companies not available to their competitors.Though the U.K. and Australia may have made it easier for Hong Kongers to relocate, it remains too early to tell if there will indeed be a mass exodus from the city amid uncertainty over the national security law.

Per President Trump\u2019s instruction, we will eliminate policy exemptions that give Hong Kong different and special treatment, with few exceptions.\"The House legislation would take those actions by the State Department a step further. A Congressional Research Service summary of the legislation says it provides for sanctions against \"foreign individuals and entities that materially contributed to China's failure\" to respect Hong Kong's autonomy and \"foreign financial institutions that knowingly conducted a significant transaction with such identified individuals and entities.\"The sanctions against financial institutions would be mandatory and the sanctions against \"entities and individuals\" would be at the discretion of the president, unless they are named on State Department reports as helping violate Hong Kong's autonomy for two consecutive years.The Senate passed a similar bill earlier this month.

I'm Laura Ingraham. This is \"The Ingraham Angle.\" Back in Washington tonight.Now, Susan Rice really wants to be Joe Biden's number two and a shameless appearance. I don't know if any of you guys saw, I hope you didn't, but I was on Meet the Press and she told this story about, well, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Well, guess what? Mike Pompeo is here with exclusive reaction to her charges against the administration. And a reminder to Americans about what her ascension would bring.Also, tonight, what do COVID deaths really mean today when they continue to plummet as the number of cases rise? Of course, we don't want anyone to die of COVID. It's a horrible thing and a tragedy. But what do these numbers really tell us? And why are the experts avoiding that truth?My medicine cabinet is here on that. And, of course, the incredible news about hydroxychloroquine and the media spent the weekend lying about Trump's Mount Rushmore speech. Not at all surprising. Raymond Arroyo will tell us how it relates to Joe Biden's latest union event in Seen and Unseen. But first, why the Left lies? That's the focus of tonight's ANGLE.All right, Democrats have reached, I think the obvious conclusion that their only path, sure path to victory is the burn it all down approach of the neo Bolsheviks on the streets. Joe Biden's team has formed common cause with those who not only seek the destruction of the nuclear family. If you don't believe me, check out BLM's website.They've actually decided that promoting racial hatred is the only way they can win. They know that Trump's policies, it's obvious have delivered results for working people of all races, while theirs have largely failed. Now, the Left hopes that by inflaming a racial division and hiding their candidate, they could avoid a real debate on the issues.So, over the weekend, the President responded with two powerful speeches to celebrate our independence and identify the domestic forces now threatening it. His remarks at Mount Rushmore reaffirmed America's identity and inspired millions of Americans who've basically been living in despair because of the one two punch of the virus and the continuing riots.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: These radicals would tear down the very heritage for which men gave their lives to win the Civil War. They would tear down the principles that propelled the abolition of slavery and ultimately around the world, ending an evil institution that had plagued humanity for thousands and thousands of years. Our opponents would tear apart the very documents that Martin Luther King used to express his dream.They would tear down the beliefs, culture and identity that have made America the most vibrant and tolerant society in the history of the Earth. We will proclaim the ideals of the Declaration of Independence, and we will never surrender the spirit and the courage and the cause of July 4th, 1776.Upon this ground, we will stand firm and unwavering. In the face of lies meant to divide us, demoralize us, and diminishes.(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM: Now, you can always tell how effective one of the President's speeches is by how frenzy the reaction from liberals.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I actually thought it was some fantasy. He's just desperate.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: There was a lot about history, about God and our great country. Much of it very ominous.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: There was no attempt here to unify the country. It was a divisive message.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The President threw down the cultural wall. Got it. In defense of dead white men.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Inflammatory, hateful, watching it. You realize how disturbing, how disturbing this President really is.(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM: You notice, I describe liberals and Kasich and Jennifer Rubin are among them. You bet. Now, if lying was an Olympic sport, these folks would be draped in gold medals. In moments of rare candor, they know that Trump beats Biden hands down on jobs and wages for African Americans. Trump beats Biden on education. He favors liberation for parents and students who are stuck in bad schools.Trump beat Biden on prison reform. Obama and Biden both talked a good game. They didn't get it done. And, of course, Trump has done something that Biden never did. He has actually hired and promoted African Americans and other minorities across as many businesses.Now, where Biden and Democrats are content to patronize African Americans with these meaningless symbolic gestures, conservatives actually believe that minorities want what all people want, a fair chance at prosperity and to pursue their happiness in freedom and safety. Trump knows this is only possible with a vibrant, growing economy where all criminals are prosecuted.Meanwhile, Biden thinks he can surf to victory on racial anger stoked by mobs, many of whom are white, who would rather see every city in America burn than a second Trump term.Now, this requires a massive effort to lie and defame one that an honest press would have exposed long ago. Now, as I've said before, instead of covering the Democrats, the media cover for them, their tactics, and their toxic associations, I'm talking about.So long as the end game of any activist or politician is to rid America of Trump, the press will excuse all manner of falsehoods, hypocrisy and even criminality. So, to stoke racial tension, the Biden campaign requires a massive effort to lie and defame one that, of course, would have already been exposed long ago.Now, when you think back - when you think about how this whole thing went down, how did it go down? It went down after this long shutdown. People had a lot of time on their hands. Again, if we continue to allow these lies and this ongoing slander and defamation to continue, well, what happens? People will continue to lose faith in the system of laws and even an equal protection.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GYASI ROSS, AUTHOR: You know, people - looters got a bad name during the George Floyd protests, but thank goodness for the looters, man.

If you think that's wacky, it is. That's right. There is a Cancel Hamilton hashtag out there now.Now, never mind that all the key roles, including those of Alexander Hamilton and George Washington are played by people of color in the musical. Critics say it glosses over key facts. They claim Hamilton was not an abolitionist and traded slaves for his in-laws. The mere fact that it celebrates the founding era in any positive way to good music is ample reason for the Left to call for its cancellation.Now, the only thing at this point that's sacred to them is the notion that if you're a leftist, you cannot be questioned or prosecuted for crimes. Yes. The ends justify the means, you bet they do. Past grievances may never have to say you're sorry. The media will give you a pass for anything. At the same time, they spy racism around every corner.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Smollett says he was assaulted by two masked men who yelled out racial and homophobic slurs.

Well, simple to deflect from the Democrats own horrific record on race, the economy and crime.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This is now a third week in a row where we have seen children shot and killed here. It's part of a weekend where we saw more than 60 people shot and over a dozen people killed. So, it is point blank what is happening right now.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The ecosystem, a public safety that isn't just law enforcement, but is local community base. They, too, have really been hit hard by COVID and are now just kind of coming back online and getting their footing.(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM: What? Did you just hear that? Chicago seen a tragic level of violence since the Black Lives Matter marches started. And it's claiming African American lives and costing the black community dearly. The bad guys here aren't the folks going to Mount Rushmore. They're criminals murdering children on the streets of our nation's third largest city. 80 people were shot and 17 killed in Chicago last week. We can alone and at least 13 of those were African American. And it gets even more tragic, including among the dead is a seven-year-old, Natalia Wallace. She was shot in the head.She was visiting her grandmother for the Fourth of July. And sadly, she wasn't the only child killed. In Southeast D.C., 11-year-old Davon McNeal shot and killed at a Fourth of July cookout with his family. Armed thugs in Atlanta murdered eight-year-old Secoria Turner near the Wendy's where Rayshard Brooks died at the hands of police. Now, this is senseless and awful killing, and it's obviously left her parents heartbroken, shattered and asking why.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SECORIYA WILLIAMSON, FATHER OF SLAIN 8-YEAR-OLD GIRL: They say Black Lives Matter, killed their own. Just because of barrier. They killed my baby because she crossed the barrier and made - you killed a child. She didn't do nothing to nobody.(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM: Now every single one of these cities is run by Democrats. And rather than addressing violent crime, drugs, and fatherlessness plaguing so many communities, they just make excuses. They throw out phrases like systemic racism, unconscious bias or white privilege and minimizing the importance of personal responsibility, love of one's neighbor and the value of every human life. So, rather than insisting on law and order, safety in every community, including African American communities, this is the best they can offer.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)KEISHA LANCE BOTTOMS, ATLANTA MAYOR: We talk about systemic racism and the trauma and anxiety and you think about the leadership or the lack thereof that we have coming from the highest office in the land. I think that you are seeing so many emotions play out. And so too often it's playing out in violence in our streets.(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM: Emotions are playing out? I think some folks are still trying to pretend that all of this mayhem will stop if we just let the Democrats have the White House. Well, we have the Democrats in power in Atlanta and Chicago, in New York, in Baltimore and beyond and beyond. What's happened? So, this thinking is foolish and naive. The Democrats have shown they're utterly unwilling to restrain the hard left from seizing property and committing violence.And as for the culture wars, why would the radical stop when they think they're winning? So, ignore the folks who say that it just gets better when we let the Democrats have more power. The only way this situation gets better is for Democrats to lose and lose so often that they're forced to apologize for their relentless slandering of our nation's history and by extension, the majority of our citizens who still unapologetically love this country and still believe that it's worth celebrating. And that's THE ANGLE.Joining me now is Craig Shirley, Presidential Historian and Ronald Reagan biographer. And Craig, look, people like to say this feels like the 1960s, 1968. But what are we seeing here? You heard those sound bites I've just played from those ineffective mayors. What are we seeing from the Left here that's different this time?CRAIG SHIRLEY, PRESIDENTIAL HISTORIAN: I think there's more of a mindlessness, irresponsible ability today than there was in 1960s. At least those protests against the Vietnam War. But, you know, in some ways it was worse than because we had something on the order of 20, 30 GIs dying in Southeast Asia every year. Parts of America were actually like, for instance, Lake Erie were catching on fire. Pollution was out of control. Corporate pollution was out of control.So, in some ways, the country was worse off. Economic deprivation was far worse in 1968 than it is today. On the other hand, too is that there was good reason to oppose on the part of many people. The war in Vietnam. But some people did it peacefully. Other people didn't do it peacefully. But there seems to be today kind of a recklessness. And with the actions (ph) of much of the establishment of much of law enforcement and much of Republican leaders who aren't even standing up.You know, I listened to Trump's speech on Saturday. I said myself, I said thank God, finally, somebody is articulating American exceptionalism, American standards, because we're not getting it from any other elected Republican official.INGRAHAM: Craig, are you surprised or maybe we're not even surprised? You and I have been around Washington for so many years that there are so many feckless Republicans and ineffective think tanks, if I hear the word - phrase think tanks one more time. They love to quote the founders in their big fat dinners, they sponsor and raise money for themselves. But when push comes to shove, where are they in defending the founders? Where are they?SHIRLEY: They're nowhere to be seen. You know, the diver towers (ph) for a reason that they don't get their hands dirty. They don't get out and they don't stuff envelopes. They don't work the phones; they don't run for office. They're all about offering suggestions and bromides and pearls of wisdom, things like that.But when it comes - when push comes to shove, they're nowhere to be found. I've been in many, many political fights over my years. You know, I worked on many, many campaigns and these people who professed of the movement conservatives and fighters for the right, things like that. I've never seen any of the political camp or even in a political movement or a fight with Congress.INGRAHAM: Craig, I want to get your reaction to a quote unquote fact check from USA Today with this headline, Democratic Party did not find the KKK, did not start the Civil War. However, the article goes on to admit this. Historians agree that although factions of the Democratic Party did majorly contribute to the civil war start in the KKK founding, it's inaccurate to say the party is responsible for either. Craig, I know you're champing at the bit to get at this one.SHIRLEY: Nathan Bedford Forrest was a civil war general. The Library of Congress says he was a Democrat. He was the founder of the KKK Democrat. The KKK was, for all intents and purposes, the shock troops, the terrorist arm of the Democratic Party in the posts of war area right up to the 1920s, right up to the 1950's, even into the 1960's.They were the ANTIFA of their era. The Democratic Party started the Civil War because the Republican Abraham Lincoln was elected in 1860. And 1861, Fort Sumter was fired on by Southern Democrats. The fort held by union troops. And that was what kicked off the Civil War, it was the attack by Southern Democrats on northern troops in Fort Sumter, in Charleston Harbor in South Carolina.INGRAHAM: Yes, the USA--SHIRLEY: I read that piece, and I just shook my head. I'm thinking this is the perfect example of why the Left is so dangerous because they will lie about anything to achieve power.INGRAHAM: And that's perfectly in line with the Angle's title. Why they lie? This is the only way they can get power by distorting history and toppling statues. I guess they think that's the future. Craig, we're going to have you back real soon. There's a lot, lot, we have to go through with you. Thank you so much.And what I'm about to show you is one of the more shocking videos we've seen throughout the past few weeks. A small army of supposed militia members converged on the Stone Mountain monument in Georgia yesterday. Now, watch what happened when some of them confronted a white driver.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We ain't no Black Lives Matter, we ain't none of that bullshit. Scoot on. We're black militia, your worst nightmare. We're the black militia bro.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What are you?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I just told you what I was. Everywhere you go, you want to rape, rob, and kill us.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Oh, really?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And you steal people's culture and have an attitude about it. Where's our reparations? Thank you.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What did I do to you?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's not what you did, it's what your ancestor did.(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM: Joining me now is Dr. Wilfred Reilly, Assistant Professor of Political Science at Kentucky State University. Dr. Wilfred, this moment strikes me as a dangerous tipping point. Your thoughts?DR. WILFRED REILLY, PROFESSOR KENTUCKY STATE UNIVERSITY: I have a great deal of faith in the United States of America. And I don't think we're going to tip into any kind of actual race war or class war. But I think I mean; this is an election year. I don't think that's a coincidence. And I think you're seeing a lot of the worst instincts people have politically being very intentionally ramped up right now. And that's never good.INGRAHAM: Well, you have members of a so-called militia. They all appear to be black. Going car, window to car window. And, you know, a lot of people online were saying, what if the races were reversed? The media would be going crazy about. I hardly saw it covered at all over the weekend except online. And it certainly seemed different from what we've seen with protest or even tearing down statues?REILLY: Well, I do think there is an element of truth to that. I mean, in my most recent book, Taboo, I look at a lot of these cultural questions in American society. And I mean, one of the things I find that other researchers have found many times before is that the large 75 to 80 percent majority of those killed by police in a typical year, for example, are Caucasian or Hispanic individuals.And those cases received less than 20 percent of the media coverage of police violence. You can look at interracial crime the same way. There's fairly little interracial crime. A 93 percent of black murder victims. 85 percent of white murder victims are killed by people of the same race. The person most likely to kill you is your ex-wife or current husband.But when you look at interracial crime, that in general slants say 80 percent black on white. Among those two races, media coverage slants in the exact opposite direction. And we do have to ask why that is. I mean, what are the biases in the media that caused that slant?INGRAHAM: Doctor?REILLY: I think you might suspect what some of those are.INGRAHAM: Yes. Dr. Reilly, really quickly, this horrific violence that we've seen as this effort to defund the police has really accelerated. You say and about 30 seconds, sir. You say that this is one of the great failings and revelations about Black Lives Matter. Explain.REILLY: I think that everyone who is not a virulent racist agrees with the statement that black lives matter. But I think a great many black taxpayers and non-racist white Americans are wondering if they agree with the policy goals of the group named after that slogan. And yes, Black Lives Matter right now, if you look at their website, focuses almost entirely on police on black violence and white on black violence.And as I just said, I would love to see much more focus brought to the real problem in black communities, which very often is black on black violence. There are 15,000 murders a year. Half of those victims happen to be black, just like white murder victims. They're almost all killed by someone of the same race.INGRAHAM: OK. Dr. Reilly, thank you for your perspective tonight. It's really important. Coming up, my exclusive interview with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. You don't want to miss it.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)INGRAHAM: Given all her recent media appearances, it's pretty clear that Obama's former National Security Adviser, Susan Rice, is seriously gunning to be Joe Biden's number two. Now, yesterday on Meet the Press, she revealed the cheapness of her political ambitions. Well, she did so when she commented on what has largely turned out to be a very murky story concerning Russian bounties on American soldiers in Afghanistan.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SUSAN RICE, FORMER NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER: This is not the time to be handing Putin an olive branch. We have a President who is doing our arch adversaries bidding, it would seem, and he's surrounded by sycophants and weaklings who aren't doing their jobs, who don't have the confidence in themselves and the mission that they are to carry out to bring the President the tough messages he needs to hear.(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM: Now, one of the targets of that smear, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo joins me exclusively now. Mr. Secretary, great to see you. Now, I know you feel that Rice's remarks show a lack of restraint that our country can't afford to have back in the White House. Explain all that.MIKE POMPEO, SECRETARY OF STATE: Laura, thanks for having me on to hear Ambassador Rice talk that way is just crazy. You know, she has a history of going on Sunday shows and lying. You all remember that back in 2012, she went on five Sunday shows and Ambassador Chris Stevens, Sean Smith, Glen Doherty, and Tyrone Woods had all perished under her administration's watch in Benghazi, Libya.She went on and made up a story about a video and a protest when she knew full well that this was a terror attack. She did so because it was politically convenient to say that. It's the worst kind of behavior from a national security leader. And as for her comments about Russia, it was on the Obama watch, under the Susan Rice watch, under Vice President Biden's watch that Ukraine had one-fifth of its real estate taken by Vladimir Putin with virtually no response.It was under her watch that Syria was handed over to the Russians as a result of a red line that Obama had drawn in the sand, but then refused to enforce. And you'll recall too, when it comes to having American soldiers taking care of what she suggests this administration didn't do but does always. It was her administration that was underwriting the Iranian regime while it was killing American soldiers in the Middle East.That was an administration that didn't care about our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines and certainly didn't act away that was securing the American national interest.INGRAHAM: Now, Mr. Secretary, we don't have to play the sound bite, but John Bolton essentially in his never-ending media tour for his book. He said, it's inconceivable that the President wouldn't have been briefed on this report about Russia. Your response to his continued push against the administration on these matters of national security?POMPEO: Yes, I don't want to go back and forth with John Bolton, other than to say much of what we had in his book and the number of the things he had said in the aftermath that haven't proven to be true. He was there. He saw that this administration worked hard to make sure the President have all the information, he needed to make good sound national security decisions.And with respect to this particular issue in Afghanistan, I can assure every one of your viewers that this administration acted in a way to protect every American who was serving in Afghanistan. We have fought the Taliban harder than the previous administers never dreamed about fighting them, and now President Trump is going to protect our soldiers by working to get a peace and reconciliation deal that allows them to come home.INGRAHAM: Mr. Secretary, your thoughts on these former Bush staffers. This is kind of what they did when Trump was running in 2016. But all these former Bush staffers coming and saying we're going to support Joe Biden, what about that? And what does that reveal about their alliances, the alliances they will make in order to defeat Donald Trump?POMPEO: It's sad. This is an administration that has executed its national security function in a way that every American can be proud of, whether it was striking Qasem Soleimani or the remarkable work we did take down the entire caliphate in Syria, terrorism, the work we've done to put pressure on Iran. To watch these former officials now suggest that somehow former Vice President Biden is going to be the right outcome to protect Americans is just silly.INGRAHAM: What will their China policy look like? From what you know now with what Biden believes is the real threat to the United States and the culture wars, what can we expect as Americans as a policy toward China if that likelihood would come to pass?POMPEO: Laura, I think we know because we have eight years of history with President Obama and Vice President Biden's China policy. They did nothing. Whether it was on the important issues we are facing today on human rights, whether that's in Tibet or Hong Kong or in the western part where Uighurs are being forced to conduct abortions and forced sterilizations, they did nothing. Whether it was in Taiwan where they refused to do the right thing, or even protecting Americans from predatory economic activity, costing Americans thousands and hundreds of thousands of jobs here in the United States. We know what the Obama-Biden administration did with respect to China. It kowtowed, it appeased, turned the other cheek, and it left America in a weaker position as a direct result of that failure to lead.INGRAHAM: Speaking of which, I know you have probably seen this, but China is eradicating freedom in Hong Kong. You warned of this for years, and \"The Wall Street Journal\" reports that Chinese law now requires Hong Kong authorities to strengthen regulation of the media and the Internet and empowers Beijing to deploy state security agencies to establish a bureau overseeing national security in Hong Kong. And now they are not ruling out, Mr. Secretary, China is not, blocking Hong Kong citizens from leaving for the U.K., because the U.K. says you want to come back and live here, come here. So what's our response going to be? Would we welcome the Hong Kong- ers into the United States if China continues along this path, which they most certainly will?POMPEO: Yes, Laura, it's almost certain they are going to continue on this path. To your point, a few weeks back now President Trump made clear that Hong Kong was no longer autonomous. I certified the same. And we can see this is going to end up just being another communist run city. It's unfortunate. Hong Kong was such a special place where there were all the freedoms that the people of Hong Kong were promised by the Chinese Communist Party. It's much like the promise they made to tell us the truth but where the coronavirus came from. We know it started in Wuhan. We know it came from China, and yet they covered it up for an awfully long time.It's these same kinds of broken promises that will lead the United States to take the right response with respect to Hong Kong's new national security law. We have already begun the process of revoking visas for people who made these decisions. And there will be a series of actions that the administration will take. We'd love to preserve the freedom in Hong Kong, but if we can't, we are going to hold the Chinese Communist Party accountable.INGRAHAM: And finally, Mr. Secretary, the huge Chinese app TikTok has about 30 million users in the United States, but it has been banned now by India, and Australia is considering the same action, saying that TikTok was full of mass surveillance and propaganda, and also that the app had the ability to feed information straight to Beijing. So kind of obvious question, if all that's that case, shouldn't we be considering right now tonight a ban on Chinese social media apps, especially TikTok?POMPEO: Laura, your viewers should know we're taking this very seriously. We're certainly looking at it. We have worked on this very issue for a long time, whether it was the problems of having Huawei technology in your infrastructure. We've gone all over the world and we're making real progress getting that out. We declared ZTE a danger to American national security. We have done all of these things. With respect to Chinese apps on people's cell phones, I can assure you the United States will get this one right, too, Laura. I don't want to get out in front of the president, but it's something we're looking at.INGRAHAM: Would you recommend that people download that app on their phones tonight, tomorrow, any time currently?POMPEO: Only if you want your private information in the hands of the Chinese Communist Party.INGRAHAM: Mr. Secretary, it's great to see you, as always tonight. Thanks so much.POMPEO: Thank you, Laura.INGRAHAM: What's behind the lies that we heard about Trump's mush -- mush - - Mount Rushmore speech? See, you take a few days off and anything can happen. And how are they directly tied to Biden's latest union event and your kids' education? Raymond Arroyo has a can't-miss \"Seen and Unseen\" in moments.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)INGRAHAM: It's time for our \"Seen and Unseen\" segment where we reveal the stories behind the headlines. Joining us with all the details, Raymond Arroyo, FOX News contributor. Raymond, great job filling in last week, by the way, awesome numbers.RAYMOND ARROYO, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Thank you.INGRAHAM: The media reaction to the president's Mount Rushmore speech was completely negative. So what gives?ARROYO: Probably politics, Laura. \"The New York Times\" called it \"a dark and divisive speech.\" \"The Washington Post\" wrote it was also a dark speech meant to exploit the nation's racial and social divisions. And Senator Tammy Duckworth went a step further. She is running, by the way, for Biden's running mate. She put it this way.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. TAMMY DUCKWORTH, (D-IL): Were really struck me about the speech that the president gave at Mount Rushmore was that he spent more time worried about honoring dead confederates than he did talking about the lives of our 130,000 Americans lost their lives to COVID-19.(END VIDEO CLIP)ARROYO: Laura, it just wasn't true. We covered the Mount Rushmore speech live on this show. The president delivered what some thought was one of the best speeches of his presidency. It was sober. He spoke to the moment. He said absolutely nothing about confederates, but he did say this. Listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: They enshrined a divine truth that changed the world forever when they said to \"all men are created equal.\" These immortal words set in motion the unstoppable march of freedom.This leftwing cultural revolution is designed to overthrow the American Revolution. Our children are taught in school to heat their own country.(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM: I think this was frankly one of the best speeches he's given. It was very sober. I always like it when he is smiling and joking, but this is a series moment when the country's gone through a lot of pain. And I think he said that. And by the way, Duckworth also said it's worth considering whether Washington should come down as well, right? That's where they are going with this. We predicted this.ARROYO: We should have a dialogue about it, she said. The president already has had that dialogue, and he talked about that march to freedom. You have to respect it and embrace it. Everybody is part of the American story.Laura, regarding the point you heard the president made there about our children being taught, OK, to hate the country, while Trump was headed to Mount Rushmore, Joe Biden was pandering to the National Education Association, the teachers' union. He broadcast from his home where they found him wearing his mask. Does he wear it in the shower, I wonder? And why is it OK to take it off when he speaks? After unmasking, he explained his vision for education and reminded the union that Jill Biden is an NEA member.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOE BIDEN, D-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: This is going to be a teacher- oriented Department of Education. And it's not going to come from the top down. It's going to come from teachers up. You know, I -- I --You don't just have a partner in the White House. You'll have an NEA member in the White House. And if not listening, I'm going to be sleeping alone in the Lincoln Bedroom.(END VIDEO CLIP)ARROYO: Given the expected caretakers, he might have to sleep in the Lincoln Bedroom anyway. Notice, Biden's won't be a student-oriented Department of Education but a teacher-oriented department. Forget about students and parents. Biden promised to end charter schools, triple funding for Title I schools, and require increases in teachers' pay. As an example of the type of teacher Biden supports, this was the first member the teachers' union chosen to address Biden, Turquoise LeJeune Parker. Listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: My Durham public schools title is media coordinator. My self-given title is racial and social justice teacher.Black Lives Matter, period.It's my duty to structure a curriculum that talks through all kinds of conflicts, issues such as police brutality, how to fight it while staying safe, how to organize, and how they can come to terms with the possibility that they might be the next victim of white supremacy at absolutely no fault of their own.Teaching in the resistance is incredibly hard work, but we have to do it because we need our kids to know that they are absolutely a part of this movement to smash white supremacy.(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. OK --ARROYO: There's a lot there, Laura.INGRAHAM: That's his go to teacher? I love how she says my self-described title is. That kind of tells the story.ARROYO: When you and I were in school, a media coordinator, Laura, was called a librarian. Now apparently, it's someone who foments protest, teaching kids that the summit of American history is agitation, not innovation, not love, not entrepreneurship, but just groupthink and racial division. We are much more than that.INGRAHAM: What she said is she is part of the resistance. She's a member of the resistance.ARROYO: Right. And you are paying her.INGRAHAM: So we're teaching our young -- forget sentence diagramming. My kids are trying to get sentence diagramming down, OK. Forget all that, like math. We are going to teach to be organizers. The base of knowledge --ARROYO: Laura, they have moved onto diagramming autonomous zones, OK.INGRAHAM: Exactly.ARROYO: Congratulations, by the way. You're the most-watched woman in cable and the second quarter. Congrats. Kudos.INGRAHAM: I didn't even know that. You told me something I honestly didn't know.ARROYO: Yes, just announced late last week.INGRAHAM: Thanks so much, Raymond. And awesome job last week.All right, I had a shocking admission from Dr. Fauci about a possible COVID vaccine. My medicine cabinet tells us what it all means. Stay there.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)INGRAHAM: You've likely been hearing about the surge in positive coronavirus cases in recent weeks, but you haven't been told is that while there has been an explosion of new cases, especially in certain states, deaths continue to plummet. In fact, the number of daily COVID deaths is down 90 percent since peaking on April 15.But that's not the only thing that caught our eye today. During an online Q&A, Dr. Fauci made a stunning admission about a COVID vaccine.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES: We are going to assume that there is a degree of protection, but we have to assume that it's going to be finite. It's not going to be like a measles vaccine. So there's going to be follow-up on those cases to see if we need a boost. We may need a boost to continue the protection. But right now we do not know how long it lasts.(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM: OK, here with what all of this means, Dr. Ramin Oskoui, cardiologist and CEO of Foxhall Cardiology, and Dr. Stephen Smith, an infectious disease specialist who has treated so many COVID patients over the last three and four months. Dr. Oskoui, let me start with you. What is going on here with what Fauci just said?DR. RAMIN OSKOUI, CARDIOLOGIST: I think he's laying crepe for the fact that I think these MRNA vaccines simply won't work. Last week Moderna executives were reported in \"The Washington Post\" to have dumped $200 million worth of stock. They then the next day announced that they weren't going forward with a 30,000 patient phase three trial. It makes one wonder whether or not there are problems with their phase two trial, namely that the patients have had adverse effects. All of the major platforms are based on this new and unproven technology for vaccines, so it's going to be very interesting. I think he's preparing for us not to have a vaccine, frankly.INGRAHAM: OK, so we needed a vaccine, correct, in order to get back to, quote, normalcy, Dr. Oskoui. That's what we keep hearing. Yes?OSKOUI: The short answer is no, we don't, and no, we never did. What we need to do to get back to normalcy is to quarantine high risk individuals, and then we need to get back to our lives. Probably not locking down accelerated the so-called herd immunity which is not just our holy grail but which is what's going to get us out of this epidemic like it's gotten us out of prior epidemics over the millennia.INGRAHAM: Speaking of which, we are trying to get Dr. Smith back on the line in a moment, but Dr. William Haseltine gave this dire assessment of our efforts to fight the pandemic. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DR. WILLIAM HASELTINE: Herd immunity is a fantasy. It does not exist for these viruses. It's a fantasy and a dangerous fantasy. Even at best, it meant perhaps millions of people died. Are we really that far back to the pre-antibiotic era?(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM: Dr. Smith, I think we have you. What is he talking about? No herd immunity, it's worthless?DR. STEPHEN SMITH, SMITH CENTER FOR INFECTIOUS DISEASES: -- a lot that we can --INGRAHAM: We have a lousy connection. Dr. Smith, hold on a second. We have a lousy connection with you. I don't know what is going on at your house. Maybe it's rain, maybe it's lightning. Dr. Oskoui, the trashing of herd immunity, even the president is kind of pooh-poohed a number of times, like, the herd. I love that little box. There he is on that --OSKOUI: I think it's a mistake to trash it. The reality is that's the mechanism by which all vaccines work. It's the way we've gone through and conquered prior pandemics and epidemics. Herd immunity is real and it's already occurring as we speak. Since Memorial Day, we have seen people get out and about. We have seen a rise in positive tests. But as you've seen, people aren't getting as sick, and death rates continue to drop. This is what you see in herd immunity. It's virology 101, it's first, second year of medical school.INGRAHAM: Dr. Oskoui, one of our mutual friends says that we are going to end up like Sweden. A lot of people don't understand, what does that mean? Because we didn't kind of let it roll. We didn't keep kids in school. Sweden did, at least younger kids. But how does that, what does it mean, we will end up like Sweden?OSKOUI: I think what our friend is referring to is the fact that slowly and surely herd immunity has developed. The virus, as it attenuates and mutates becomes less and less problematic. Sweden was smart. They quarantined their most vulnerable, and they let their healthiest, least vulnerable individuals, namely children, continue their schooling. And that was much better for both the educational system and the health of their country and their economy. We are about three weeks behind.INGRAHAM: Since you've treated so many patients over the last months, I want to get your reaction. I know you appeared with us last week, but I wasn't here. And the hydroxychloroquine study that dropped from the Henry Ford Clinic' health system there, the mortality rate for patients on hydroxy was basically cut in half.OSKOUI: Yes.INGRAHAM: It just basically smashed back at all the doubters, all the critics. And your point is that we should take the hydroxychloroquine we have in our stockpile and perhaps consider giving it prophylactically to health care workers. Explain that.OSKOUI: Well, there are studies, and this is done in India routinely where hydroxychloroquine is given in low doses as prophylaxis to protect high- risk individuals, in India specifically the protocol is for health care workers. We now have a burst of infections in the southern states. A lot of this is due to people coming up from Mexico. And the way to protect first responders and other health care workers I think is very evident -- evidence-based, and it's to give them prophylaxis.INGRAHAM: Dr. Oskoui, thank you so much. Great to see you.When we come back, a literal last bite. You don't want to miss it.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)INGRAHAM: It's time for the Last Bite, or maybe a nibble. OK, so family and friends hit the river in Jackson, Wyoming, on Friday for some fishing, and I didn't want to show off, so here's my award winner. Do you see the fish? So many punchlines, so little time. It's a tiny little thing. It's like a bait fish.All right. Don't forget, always DVR \"The Ingraham Angle,\" it's so bad.

over the country's human rights abuses and handling of the , barbs that come as observers around the world are outraged at Beijing's treatment of pro-democracy protesters and Uyghur\u00a0Muslims.They also come during an election year and as President Trump is struggling to defend his administration's response to the coronavirus pandemic.The attacks are not new, but they represent a sharpened message on China from an administration whose messaging on the nation has run the gamut from harsh condemnation to effusive praise.\u00a0They have ranged from knocks on China for  information about the coronavirus to\u00a0\u00a0directed at American companies about working with Chinese brands due to their use of forced\u00a0labor;\u00a0from\u00a0 about China's actions in Hong Kong to condemnation for  \"the stain of the century\" of human rights violations.There have also been more general attacks, like one ominous Sunday night tweet from the State Department's official account.\"@SecPompeo: We are watching the world unite to come to understand the threat from the Chinese Communist Party,\" it reads.Pompeo, in a recent pair of speeches, has also taken explicit shots at China.\"China, in particular, is aggressively promoting a very different concept in which national priorities of various sorts prevail over the basic rights of speech, assembly, religious freedom, and free elections,\" Pompeo said Thursday at a speech about the State Department's efforts on \"unalienable rights.\"Pompeo made similar comments at the Family Leadership Summit the next day in Iowa.\"And inside China, just to give a single example, a few weeks back I read a report about the Chinese Communist Party forcing mass abortions and sterilization on Chinese Muslims in Western China,\" he said.\u00a0\"These are some of the most gross human rights violations we have seen and I\u2019ve referred to it as the stain of the century.\"He added: \"We\u2019ve called out China\u2019s war on faith. Its mass detention of Uyghurs, its godless decisions to replace church displays of the Ten Commandments with words from General Secretary Xi have not gone without being called out.\"Despite the recent tough talk, the administration has seemed to take a hodgepodge of stances on criticizing China, oftentimes depending on the issue. Trump has railed against China for taking advantage of the United States on trade deals since the 2016 campaign. But\u00a0he's often praised Chinese President Xi Jinping himself.Meanwhile, the U.S. has maintained a consistent message against China's claims in the South China Sea during the Trump administration, regularly executing freedom of navigation operations with U.S. Navy vessels. But Trump himself roiled Republicans last fall when he congratulated Xi on his country's 70th anniversary, refraining from any criticism of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).The Trump administration has sought to stymie the Chinese-controlled tech company Huawei from global 5G networks \u2014\u00a0something it just secured a major victory\u00a0at with the United Kingdom recently deciding to freeze Huawei out of its 5G infrastructure. But Trump, according to a memoir by his former National Security Adviser John Bolton, had indicated he personally didn't care about China's repression of ethnic minorities, specifically the Uyghur Muslims.\"At the opening dinner of the Osaka G20 meeting, with only interpreters present, Xi explained to Trump why he was basically building concentration camps in Xinjiang. According to our interpreter, Trump had said that Xi should go ahead with building the camps, which he thought was exactly the right thing to do,\" Bolton said. \"[Deputy National Security Advisor Matt] Pottinger told me Trump said something very similar during the 2017 trip to China, which meant we could cross repression of Uighurs off our list of possible reasons to sanction China, at least as long as trade negotiations continued.\"Trump and those in his administration have repeatedly condemned Bolton and his book, denying many of the allegations it contains.Now, amid the continuing fallout from the president's handling of the coronavirus pandemic, with Trump angrily deflecting blame for the virus toward China -- where it originated -- Pompeo and the State Department are putting rhetorical pressure on China with\u00a0renewed vigor.\"Countries that want to be global powers, countries that want to participate on the global stage, have a corresponding obligation to comply to the promises they make. China made a promise to the World Health Organization. There's a set of rules about disclosure, and when you have\u00a0 an incident in your country that could potentially lead to a pandemic, you have an obligation to report that and allow others co tome in and helo,\" Pompeo said in a video tweeted last week that was originally on The Hill's \"Virtually Live.\"The United States has withdrawn from the World Health Organization over its alleged compliance with China in covering up the coronavirus in its initial stages.Pompeo added: \"The Chinese Communist Party chose differently, they co-opted the World Health Organization to achieve that coverup, and the result today is that we have hundreds of thousands of people who have died and trillions of dollars in global damage as a direct result.\"Trump got at a similar point in an interview with \"Fox News Sunday.\"\"It came from China. They should've never let it escape. They should've never let it out,\" he said.Trump later continued: \"The World Health got a tremendous amount wrong. They basically did whatever China wanted them to. And we'll save now almost $500 million a year, which is nice. But the World Health got a lot wrong.\"China, meanwhile, has shot back in the diplomatic war of words, accusing the United States of mishandling the coronavirus and even at one point falsely accusing the U.S. Army of introducing the virus into China.\"The #US politicizes #COVID19 response at home and uses 'attacking China'\u00a0as a panacea for domestic problems. A real-life #HouseofCards\u00a0is on in #Washington, with people's lives at stake,\" Hua Chunying, a  for the country's foreign ministry, said in a tweet last week.It's unclear where U.S.-China relations could go from this increasingly hostile juncture, with another grand trade deal, cooperation on North Korea or reconciliation on geopolitical claims in East Asia looking increasingly unlikely. But any kind of military conflict still appears far-fetched, and\u00a0neither nation appears poised to institute new tariffs on the other -- private businesses in both countries continue to work in the other, with American businesses like the NBA still reluctant to even  China's human rights abuses, let alone take any action or make any statements on the matter.For now, tit-for-tat sanctions appear to be as far as either country will go, with Trump this month signing the Hong Kong Autonomy Act, a bill to sanctions Chinese entities that have contributed to eroding the freedoms once enjoyed in Hong Kong and financial institutions that do business with them. The\u00a0executive branch also announced sanctions in relation to the oppression of the Uyghur Muslims.Meanwhile, China\u00a0sanctioned some U.S. individuals, including Republican Sens. Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio. Cruz, a close ally of the administration, echoed the rhetoric from Pompeo in his response.\"Unfortunately for CCP leaders, I don't have plans to travel to the authoritarian regime that covered up the coronavirus pandemic and endangered millions of lives worldwide,\" Cruz said in a statement that also condemned\u00a0the \"horrific forced abortions and sterilizations\" of the Uyghur Muslims.", "comment": "", "topic": "State Department", "date": " July 20"}, {"cover": "https://a57.foxnews.com/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/694940094001/e0390e07-3e21-4176-b67a-4074ef36d8cd/9d0528ae-96df-4c0a-90a1-9c261ab7275b/1280x720/match/156/88/image.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "title": "Sasse slams 'Chairman Xi\u2019s spy web' after reports UK will freeze Huawei out of 5G networks", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/politics/sasse-slams-chairman-xis-spy-web-after-reports-uk-will-freeze-huawei-out-of-5g-networks", "subtitle": "The foreign policy victory for the United States comes amid tensions over the coronavirus, trade, the South China Sea, and as the two nations are engaged in a 21st-century version of the space race.", "keyword": "China and national Security", "website": "Fox News", "author": "Tyler Olson", "content": "Sen.

It also comes as the two countries are engaged in military posturing in the South China Sea, trade tensions continue and both nations scramble\u00a0to gain the upper hand in a 21st-century version of the space race.China's\u00a0pervasive human rights abuses and crackdowns against free speech, particularly with a new \"national security\" law passed last week aimed at pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong, also complicate the relationship between the U.S. and China \u2014\u00a0two countries with extensive economic\u00a0ties.

received many complaints about the recent elections, and cited law 599G which prohibits \u201cgroup gatherings of more than 50 people.\u201d She said this was a factor in the investigation the

protesters have been arrested for waiving Hong Kong Independence flags and demonstrating against mainland China\u2019s attempts to gain control in the once semi-autonomous region.The U.S. has implemented policy changes, such as rolling back Hong Kong\u2019s Special Status -- which meant the U.S. recognized Hong Kong as separate from China and allowed for benefits largely through trade and

Trump also said the ban would be \"one of many\" options to punish China for its coronavirus response.TikTok was invented in the United States and then acquired by Chinese company ByteDance, which is headquartered in Beijing. Chinese law allows any Chinese company to confiscate any and all data. There are no commensurate protections from government privacy intrusion like there are here in the U.S., opening the door for large transfers of American's data to the Chinese, usually unbeknownst to American citizens.\"Basically any Chinese technology, if you generate data, and you use Chinese technology, whether it's Lenovo laptop, a Huawei phone, or a TikTok app, all of that data is at risk of going to the Chinese government,\" Roslyn Layton, co-founder of Chinatechthreat.com, said in an interview with Fox News.Layton said a common misconception is that TikTok is also used in China, but it's not operative there. The social media\u00a0app\u00a0promotes free creative expression which is counter to free speech controls implemented by Chinese propaganda authorities. There is also no reciprocity when it comes to mobile apps. American-made apps are not allowed to be sold in China, but the reverse is the case in the U.S.Some experts and elected representatives are urging Americans not to\u00a0download the app.\"It collects your geolocation in realtime, that is a problem for soldiers and military personnel because they can be identified by the Chinese government, it's a problem for children, in fact, TikTok was fined by the Federal Trade Commission for illegally collecting child information...also for your beliefs, they wanted to censor those videos [on Hong Kong],\" said\u00a0 Layton, who also served as an advisor on Trump's\u00a0FCC transition team in 2016.TikTok has denied it collects Americans' data, telling Fox News in a statement,\u00a0\"TikTok is led by an American CEO, with hundreds of employees and key leaders across safety, security, product, and public policy here in the U.S. We have no higher priority than promoting a safe and secure app experience for our users. We have never provided user data to the Chinese government, nor would we do so if asked.\"But that assessment does not seem to have won over the White House. The options open to the president include issuing a proclamation forcing the divestiture of business holdings in the app or more sanctions on its parent company.TikTok reported 30 million monthly active users in the U.S. as of May and is popular with people between 16 and 24 years old.

The act imposes sanctions on entities that help violate Hong Kong's autonomy and financial institutions that do business with them, and comes as a response to the passage of a \"national security\" law that tightened Beijing's grip on Hong Kong \u2014 which has been semi-autonomous from the mainland since 1997.The Chinese law, implemented earlier this summer, says that those who destroy government facilities and utilities would be considered subversive. Damaging public transportation facilities and arson would constitute acts of terrorism. Any person taking part in secessionist activities, whether organizing or participating, would violate the law regardless of whether violence is used.It comes after a full year of pro-democracy protests in the former British territory that was handed over to China 23 years ago on the condition that it would keep\u00a0a high degree of autonomy from mainland China and a British-style rule of law \u2014\u00a0a \"one country, two systems\" framework. China has slowly encroached on Hong Kong's autonomy, leading U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo early this year to declare that it is \"no longer autonomous.\"The new law prohibits what Beijing views as secessionist, subversive or terrorist activities or as foreign intervention in Hong Kong affairs and is seen as a direct response to the protest\u2019s calls for democracy. Under the law, police now have sweeping powers to conduct searches without warrants and order internet service providers and platforms to remove messages deemed to be in violation of the legislation.With Trump\u2019s executive order, exports from Hong Kong will be subject to the same tariffs the White House has imposed on goods from mainland China \u2013 marking a blow for leaders in Beijing as they struggle to revamp their economy amid the coronavirus pandemic and cutting off a lucrative loophole. The announcement from Trump also comes a day after the White House rejected nearly all of\u00a0\u2019s claims in the contested South China Sea.The administration presented the decision as an attempt to curb China\u2019s increasing assertiveness in the region with a commitment to recognizing international law. But it will almost certainly have the more immediate effect of further infuriating the Chinese, who are already retaliating against numerous U.S. sanctions and other penalties on other matters.Ties between China and the U.S. have deteriorated steadily over the coronavirus pandemic, human rights, Beijing policy toward Hong Kong and trade. The Trump administration has also slapped visa bans on Chinese officials deemed responsible for barring foreigners\u2019 access to Tibet, along with those seen as enforcing a clampdown on civil rights in Hong Kong.Tensions ratcheted up in the last few days with the actions taken by both the U.S. and China.On Monday, China said\u00a0it will impose sanctions on three U.S. lawmakers and one ambassador in response to similar actions taken by the U.S. last week against Chinese officials over alleged human rights abuses against Muslims in the Xinjiang region.U.S. Senators Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz, Rep.

Typically, consulates carry out services such as issuing visas and engaging in cultural exchanges. But the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) outpost in  was far from a typical consulate.Instead, the consulate served as a front for the CCP and a central node in the massive spying operation that  uses to undermine the United States. This network carries out all sorts of espionage \u2014 political, defensive, industrial, academic, and commercial \u2014 to try to gain a strategic edge over the U.S. by cheating and stealing.America\u2019s adversaries, including China and Russia, use their consulates to conduct all sorts of nefarious activities. For the CCP, the Houston consulate served as a base of operations to exploit commercial joint ventures for state purposes and to gain access to advanced technology, proprietary information, and intellectual property in order to advance Beijing\u2019s efforts to undermine U.S. economic and national security.Critically, the Houston consulate covered China's activities in seven states, including my home state of Florida.The Chinese diplomats had been involved in stealing scientific research, as well as facilitating travel to China using falsified paperwork. The consulate also had used CCP-controlled community groups to cultivate Texas elites. And considering this occurred in Houston, the malign Chinese activity likely involved theft and espionage connected to the U.S. energy and health care sectors.The Trump administration\u2019s decision to shut the consulate down is exactly right and sends a strong message to China, Russia and other adversaries that this illegal espionage will no longer be tolerated.This isn\u2019t the first time the Trump administration has had to deal with this sort of behavior. Just last December, it was forced to expel two Chinese Embassy officials on suspicions of espionage, after they were caught attempting to access a sensitive military installation in Virginia.We cannot simply ignore the prolific increase of Chinese espionage and political influence operations, especially on American soil. Sometimes a hammer is required to send a message.As the consular staff members pack their bags, we must also remember that the Houston consulate was a cog in a much larger system of exploitation.The CCP is seemingly unable to conduct international relations without spying, especially on the people the party claims as its own, such as Chinese-Americans \u2014 wherever they are and in every facet of their lives.Chinese espionage and data collection are evident all throughout their diplomatic corps \u2014\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 from excessive visa application requirements on Chinese Americans, to exerting control over Chinese community organizations, to pushing co-opted Chinese students toward sensitive research areas.Chinese surveillance and influence operations can be pointed to different ends. Some influence agents are tasked with swaying members of Congress as well as state and local politicians under the auspices of diplomatic relations. Others steal commercial secrets from defense contractors or in important sectors like advanced manufacturing.The United States has tried to work productively with China to reduce these tactics and mend relations.For example, in 2015, both of our governments agreed to stop using their intelligence services to steal technology for commercial gain. That agreement lasted just weeks, and the Trump administration made clear to Beijing that Americans would not allow China\u2019s underhanded treachery by indicting three Chinese government-affiliated hackers for stealing economic secrets in 2017.The message went unheeded. China\u2019s exploitation of American companies continued relentlessly. Just this week, the Justice Department accused two Chinese hackers working for Beijing's spy service of trying to steal information pertaining to the creation of a COVID-19 vaccine.By closing the Houston consulate, the United States signaled the status quo between the United States and China is unacceptable.In the meantime, I will soon be introducing legislation to ban Chinese firms from American capital markets if those companies are found to have engaged in espionage or human rights abuses, or otherwise exist to bolster Beijing\u2019s military.It is in everyone\u2019s interest for the United States and China to enjoy a balanced relationship in the 21st century.

Jim Risch, R-Idaho, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said he was relieved the U.K. has initiated a plan to remove Huawei products from its communications systems.\u201cI have long been concerned about the national security risks posed by allowing high-risk vendors such as Huawei, and with them, the Chinese Communist Party, into any of our allies\u2019 telecommunications infrastructure,\u201d he said\u00a0in a statement emailed to Fox News. \u201cI know this has not been an easy decision to make, but it is the right one.

The United States has recognized Hong Kong as separate from mainland China since 1992, and Hong Kong enjoyed certain trade deals as a result.But Pompeo announced earlier this month that the U.S. will move forward with ending Hong Kong\u2019s special status as a result of Beijing\u2019s new overreaching security laws.", "comment": "", "topic": "China", "date": " July 8"}, {"cover": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/05/156/88/Trump-AP-Pompeo-Getty.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "title": "Helen Raleigh: Trump admin on China\u2019s human rights abuses \u2014 tough stance deserves credit", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/trump-administration-chinas-human-rights-abuses-helen-raleigh", "subtitle": "Many Americans are not aware of what the Trump administration has done to address human rights issues in China.", "keyword": "China and national Security", "website": "Fox News", "author": "", "content": "The  administration imposed sanctions on several senior officials of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), accusing them of playing key roles in human rights abuses against Uyghur Muslims and other religious minorities in\u00a0Xinjiang region, China. These officials and their immediate families will be barred from entering the U.S. and any of their international assets will be frozen.What makes this announcement even more significant is that the most senior official on this latest sanction list is Chen Quanguo, a member of CCP's elite 25-member Politburo, which is the most powerful political body in  and counts CCP's General Secretary Xi Jinping as its most senior member. No previous U.S. administrations had ever imposed sanctions on any CCP official at this senior level. This announcement came one week after the Associated Press reported that the CCP has imposed draconian birth control measures in order to limit Muslim population growth.Early\u00a0this year, President Trump\u00a0signed the\u00a0Uyghur  Policy Act of 2020, which gives him authority to impose sanctions against individuals in China involved in human rights violations against Uyghur and other ethnic groups in Xinjiang. Besides punishing CCP officials, the Trump administration also warned\u00a0recently that it would crack down on U.S. businesses, organizations and individuals who either contributed to human rights abuses or benefited from forced labor in Xinjiang or elsewhere in China.Secretary of State Mike Pompeo made it clear that \u201cthe United States will not stand idly by as the Chinese Communist party carries out human rights abuses targeting Uighurs, ethnic Kazakhs and members of other minority groups in Xinjiang, to include forced labor, arbitrary mass detention, and forced population control, and attempts to erase their culture and Muslim faith.\u201d\u00a0 The Trump administration certainly backed up its words with actions.The rest of the world has been aware of the CCP's human rights abuses in Xinjiang since 2016, yet other than paying lip service, no other government nor the United Nation's Human Rights Council has taken any meaningful steps to address such abuses like the Trump administration has done. The Trump administration's latest sanctions also came only one day after the administration issued visa bans against CCP officials who are responsible for barring foreigners' access to Tibet.Since President Trump signed the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act last year, Secretary Pompeo indicated that more sanctions are coming against Chinese officials who are responsible for enforcing Beijing's new national security law, which has already effectively curbed Hong Kong's autonomy and Hong Kongers' long-cherished political freedom since it came into effect at midnight of June 30.The Trump administration's one-two punch on China's human rights issues is unprecedented and it has done more to address China's human rights issues than all previous administrations, including those run by Republican presidents.For example, after Beijing brutally cracked down on peaceful pro-democracy protests in Tiananmen Square in 1989, President George H.W. Bush initially condemned Beijing's actions and temporarily suspended some arms sales to China.\u00a0 However, rather than taking a strong stand, he quickly announced \"now is the time to look beyond the moment to important and enduring aspects of this vital relationship for the United States.\"The Bush administration's willingness to continue to do business with Beijing while overlooking bloodstains on the streets only strengthened the CCP's cynicism that Western democracies are nothing but a greedy bunch who are always keen on trading professed values for money. The CCP often quotes Vladimir Lenin's words, \"The Capitalists will sell us the rope with which we will hang them\" to show their contempt for western democracies.Minxin Pei, a professor of government at Claremont McKenna College wrote recently that \"such cynicism now permeates China\u2019s strategy of asserting full control over Hong Kong. Chinese leaders expect the West\u2019s anger at their actions to fade quickly, calculating that Western firms are too heavily invested in the city to let the perils of China\u2019s police state be a deal-breaker.\"From President George H. W. Bush to President Barack Obama, every administration had proved that the CCP's cynicism was right. However, Pei continued, \"in Trump and his national-security hawks, China has finally met its match... no CCP leader ever imagined that the US government would be willing to write off the Chinese market in pursuit of broader geopolitical objectives,\" including taking a strong stand for human rights issues in China.One person in the Trump administration who stands out and who has been consistently and relentlessly advocating for human rights issues in China is Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo. When he speaks about China, he always makes the distinction between the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people.He consistently emphasizes that his criticism of the CCP is not to create confrontation but out of the hope that the CCP will \"respect basic human rights of its own people\" and \"the genius of its people to flourish.\" He mentions human rights in every speech on China and he has been quickly and openly condemned Beijing's human rights abuses either through issuing statements or social media posts, time and again.More importantly, Secretary Pompeo always backs up his words with actions. Last year, he met with Hong Kong pro-democracy leader Martin Lee and the publisher of Apple Daily, Jimmy Lai, both of whom were arrested by Hong Kong police early this year for their support and participation of what Hong Kong authorities deemed \u201cunlawful protests\u201d from August to September 2019.On May 27, 2020, less than a week after Beijing announced it intended to impose a new national security law on Hong Kong, Secretary Pompeo\u00a0provided his certification\u00a0to Congress, stating \u201cHong Kong is no longer autonomous from China.\u201dHis certification, which is required under the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, enables the Trump administration to identify proper response to Beijing's breach of an international treaty it signed with Great Britain in 1984, which was supposed to guarantee Hong Kong's semi-autonomy status for 50 years.Then on the eve of the 31st year anniversary of the 1989 Tiananmen Square Massacre, Secretary Pompeo met former student leaders and survivors.\u00a0 His words and actions advocating for human rights in China earned him vicious attacks from China's state-owned media which called him a \"common enemy of mankind.\u201d\u00a0 They should have known that no amount of name-calling will silence Secretary Pompeo.Many Americans are not aware of what the Trump administration has done to address human rights issues in China because mainstream liberal media would much rather spend their energy and time attacking the administration than actually reporting on the administration's accomplishments. No doubt the CCP is delighted to have Americans\u2019 liberal media outlets doing its bidding, free of charge.It's time American people give the Trump administration credit where credit is due, for its global leadership and all the remarkable actions it has taken to hold the CCP accountable for human rights abuses in China.", "comment": "(133)", "topic": "OPINION", "date": " July 13"}, {"cover":

U.N.'s Human Rights Council panel, which is in charge of choosing human rights monitors globally. Then on April 27, in the throes of a controversy over its handling of the \u00a0and its questionable relationship with the , China was appointed chair for selecting the upcoming Special Rapporteur,\u00a0or \"U.N. expert on free speech.\"That selection was announced this week \u2014\u00a0the Chinese Communist Party\u00a0named Bangladeshi-born attorney Irene Khan, who has become something of a controversial figure in recent years for her support of the Beijing leadership.Yet despite accusations of widespread human\u00a0rights violations, China continues to ascend in the international body founded on principles of justice, peace and accountability.\"The U.N. is often an upside-down parallel universe. The election process and governance structure of organizations like the Human Rights Council make it easily susceptible to exploitation by China and other U.S. adversaries,\" Richard Goldberg, a senior advisor at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies (FDD) told Fox News. \"We need a proactive diplomatic campaign to delegitimize and degrade the organization while establishing credible, alternative mechanisms to hold human rights abusers accountable.\"According to Hillel Neuer, the executive director of the Geneva-based, independent human rights organization U.N.\u00a0, Khan \"enjoys close ties with the Communist regime\" and has \"showered praise for the Chinese regime\" and its Belt and Road Initiative, which is  one of the factors fueling the persecution of minorities like the Uighurs.In addition, Khan is said to have lauded China's \"contribution to global sustainable development\" through a $1 trillion infrastructure program tailored to increase its reach and ownership of strategic places and organizations in at least 70 countries.Khan \u2013 whose appointment as Special Rapporteur\u00a0will go into effect next month \u2013 served as Secretary-General of Amnesty International from 2001 to 2009, and left under unclear circumstances. Throughout her tenure, critics accused Khan of redirecting the human rights watchdog into fighting poverty and away from its original mandate centered on advocacy for prisoners of conscience. In 2011, she went on to become director-general of the Rome-based International Development Law Organization, which focuses on the rule of law and sustainable development, of which China is one of the eight state financiers.\"[Khan]\u00a0has a record of being a supporter of economic and social rights over political and civil liberties,\" noted Sean Roberts, director and associate professor of International Development Studies at the George Washington University. \"As such, it is likely that China is banking on the idea that she will continue this legacy at the U.N. and avoid highlighting freedom of speech issues related to the internal politics of any given country, including China.\"As chair of the five-nation Human Rights Council, which the U.S. withdrew from in 2018 at the behest of then-Ambassador Nikki Haley, China vetted and picked Khan out of 48 applicants to serve as the United Nations Special Rapporteur for freedom of expression and opinion, becoming the first woman to hold such a title.\"The Chinese government has been working hard to be a participant in as many of the U.N.'s initiatives as possible, both in terms of funding and engagement. At the same time, the United States is increasingly stepping back from the U.N., allowing China to take on an even greater role,\" Roberts underscored. \"And China's soft power globally, especially in the developing world, is on the rise at the same time as that of the U.S. is on the wane. Thus, China is able to get support from a lot of other U.N. member states to achieve its goals of more authority in the U.N.\"Roberts cautioned that while the U.N. \"has never been effective enough to live up to its lofty mission,\" it remains a dominant force in global politics.\"If the U.S. continues to retreat from its role in the organization and allows China to expand its power there, China's position as a global leader will inevitably be enhanced regardless of its respect for human rights,\" he said. \"Most of all, this threatens to deteriorate any power that the Universal Declaration of Human Rights still holds in the world.\"But Chinese leadership and control of international organizations extend well beyond the scope of the United Nations.The U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission (USCC) in April published an  identifying \"Chinese citizens serving in leadership positions in key international organizations: from U.N. principal organs, and U.N. funds and programs, to U.N. specialized agencies and international trade and financial institutions.All the while, concerns are being raised by the United States and other allies with regard\u00a0to the national security law that came into play inside the once autonomous  this month.The new law paves\u00a0the way for a national security committee to be formed in Hong Kong under the jurisdiction of Beijing, and it also means that those accused of anti-government offenses now can be tried\u00a0on the mainland and subject to significantly more stringent punishments.At the U.N. Human Rights Council, which was led this month by Cuba, 53 countries voted in support of China's heavy-handed clampdown with the justification that the people of Hong Kong could now \"exercise their freedom in a safe environment.\"Those who opposed the controversial law were considerably outnumbered, led by the U.K., but garnering the support of just 26 other countries.\"China is ascending in the U.N. because the U.N. provides an environment of corruption in which the Chinese Communist Party thrives. Consider that the , a part of the United Nations, praised the 'transparency' of the Chinese during the  when the Chinese government, in fact, censored and suppressed information,\" conjectured Will Coggin, managing director of the American Security Institute. \"Much as the U.S.  the WHO, we should consider whether it's worth continuing to spend $10 billion a year to fund the U.N. What does that money get us?\"Furthermore, Beijing's treatment and forced disappearance of more than a million Chinese minority Muslims, known as Uighurs, is also coming under increasingly blistering limelight.The U.S. has long spoken out against reports of mass concentration camps, unjustified allegations of terrorism and subsequent imprisonment\u00a0and torture of the minority group, which is mostly present in the Xinjiang region. And this week U.K. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab took a bold step in denouncing China for \"gross and egregious\" human rights abuses against its Uighur population and said sanctions against those responsible cannot be ruled out.Two years ago, as evidence of such camps was first exposed, China vehemently denied their existence. The government later admitted to their existence, vowing that they were \"reeducation\" institutions and a pivotal tool against terrorism.Nonetheless, even the United Nations' own independent human rights experts have conveyed outrage over the repression of \"fundamental freedom\" by the Chinese leadership as it continues to cement its place on the Council.In a joint  last month, some 50 experts bemoaned that they had \"repeatedly communicated\" their \"grave concerns,\" ranging from \"impunity for excessive use of force by police and the alleged use of chemical agents against protesters; to the alleged sexual harassment and assault of women protesters in police stations; together with the alleged harassment of health care workers\" in Hong Kong, along with the collective repression of specific communities \u2013 \"especially religious and ethnic minorities, in Xinjiang and Tibet\" \u2013 to the disappearances of human rights advocates across the country.The U.S. took matters into their own hands this week, imposing  on 11 additional\u00a0Chinese  over human rights violations against the Uighurs. The fallout will have a direct impact on several suppliers to major international brands such as Google, Apple, HP, Ralph Lauren\u00a0and Hugo Boss, which\u00a0have financial liaisons with the newly sanctioned companies.Whether there will be any change of course on China's part remains to be seen.", "comment": "", "topic": "UNITED NATIONS", "date": " July 22"}, {"cover": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/07/156/88/Josh-Hawley-Adam-Silver.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "title": "Hawley calls for NBA's Adam Silver to testify over league's controversial China stance", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/sports/hawley-calls-for-nbas-adam-silver-to-testify-over-leagues-controversial-china-stance", "subtitle": "Sen.

We absolutely and categorically oppose forced labor.\u201dThe new sanctions from the Trump administration come as it has taken a tough stance on China in recent months, especially since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic. The State Department and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, in particular, have attacked China for\u00a0\u00a0information about the coronavirus,\u00a0\u00a0\"the stain of the century\" of human rights violations in its oppression of the Uighurs and over\u00a0its new \"national security\" law that tightens Beijing's grip on Hong Kong.Some attacks have been more general.\"@SecPompeo: We are watching the world unite to come to understand the threat from the Chinese Communist Party,\" one ominous Sunday night tweet from the State Department's official account read.The attacks on China are not new, but come after the Trump administration for years sent mixed messages on China.Trump has railed against China for taking advantage of the United States on trade deals since the 2016 campaign. But\u00a0he's often praised Chinese President Xi Jinping himself.Meanwhile, the U.S. has maintained a consistent message against China's claims in the South China Sea during the Trump administration, regularly executing freedom of navigation operations with U.S. Navy vessels. But Trump himself roiled Republicans last fall when he congratulated Xi on his country's 70th anniversary, refraining from any criticism of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).Trump himself, according to a book by former National Security Adviser John Bolton, had previously expressed a lack of interest in standing up to China on the Uighur issue -- Trump and many in his administration have condemned Bolton and his book. Yet the administration has worked furiously to freeze out Huawei, a Chinese-controlled tech company, from global 5G networks.Nevertheless, the Trump administration is now ratcheting up the pressure on China on a variety of fronts, including on the oppression of the Uighurs and the alleged cover-up of the coronavirus earlier this year. Pompeo and Trump have each taken\u00a0shots at China over the coronavirus in recent days, with Trump saying China \"should've never let it out\" in an interview on \"Fox News Sunday.\"", "comment": "", "topic": "China", "date": " July 21"}, {"cover": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/07/156/88/AP20186092227694.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "title": "Fred Fleitz: At Mount Rushmore, Trump right to highlight danger leftist radicals pose to America", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/trump-mount-rushmore-fred-fleitz", "subtitle": "President Trump celebrated America\u2019s independence and our nation\u2019s 244th birthday Friday night with stirring speech at Mount Rushmore in South Dakota calling attention to serious threats America faces here at home from radical lawbreakers.", "keyword": "China and national Security", "website": "Fox News", "author": "", "content": " celebrated America\u2019s independence and our nation\u2019s 244th birthday Friday night with stirring speech at Mount Rushmore in South Dakota calling attention to serious threats America faces here at home from radical lawbreakers.

But in truth, it would demolish both justice and society,\u201d the president said. \u201cIt would transform justice into an instrument of division and vengeance and turn our free society into a place of repression, domination and exclusion. They want to silence us, but we will not be silenced.\u201dThis celebration at the memorial known as the Shrine to Democracy could not have come at a better time.Our democratic values are being challenged by increasingly intolerant radicals. These leftists misrepresent our history and seek to impose socialism and censorship on those who disagree. As we have seen over the last two months, the radical left is prepared to do this through mob rule and violence.Despite the insistence by the left and the mainstream media that our nation is hopelessly unjust, the United States is an ever-improving great experiment. The vast majority of Americans know this. So does the rest of the world, which is why the United States is by far the leading  for immigrants.Billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk, who was born in South Africa, expressed this in an interview this year about his phenomenal success: \u201cAmerica is the land of opportunity \u2013 there is no other country where I could have done this.\u201dBut the American experiment is fragile.On the final day of the Constitutional Convention in 1787, Benjamin Franklin, was asked: \u201cWhat do we have, a republic or a monarchy?\u201d He replied: \u201cA republic, if you can keep it.\u201dAlthough most Americans reject the radical leftist attacks on our country and history, the views of the extremists will take root unless we forcefully refute them.This means not just rejecting the recent lawlessness led by radical leftist groups like Black Lives Matters (BLM) and Antifa, but actively speaking out to defend our history of freedom. This must include keeping the left\u2019s America-hating, socialist narrative out of our schools.We live in a dangerous world with enemies who would like to end the American experiment and our status as the world\u2019s superpower.Russia tried to interfere in the 2016 presidential election. It will try to do so again this year, along with other nations, especially China.America\u2019s adversaries are encouraging BLM and Antifa to undermine our country. China is openly  BLM to bash the U.S. government and discredit liberal democracies to deflect criticism of Chinese human rights violations.America faces growing international security threats, including the coronavirus pandemic.Russia and China are expanding and improving their nuclear arsenals while America struggles to keep up.North Korea has not ended its nuclear and ballistic missile programs.Iran continues to develop its missile program and likely has robust clandestine nuclear weapons.The threat from radical Islamist terrorism continues and these terrorist groups likely are planning more potent attacks.China is and likely will remain the most serious security threat to the United States and the world. China\u2019s ruling Communist Party is not interested in peaceful co-existence or free and fair trade.Beijing is using diplomatic, military, economic, cyber, and espionage pressure and tools to supplant the United States as the global superpower and install a Chinese-led, anti-democratic world order.China has taken advantage of diverted American attention due to the coronavirus pandemic and violent protests to intensify its efforts to claim the South China Sea as part of its territory and crush what was left of Hong Kong\u2019s democracy.Fortunately, we have a president who recognizes foreign threats and is taking steps to defend our security and freedom. President Trump has built up and modernized our military, greatly improving readiness.The 2018 Nuclear Posture Review is a strategy this administration has acted on to modernize the U.S. nuclear arsenal after years of neglect.The Trump administration destroyed the ISIS state in Syria and Iraq and used military strikes to punish Syria for using chemical weapons against its people.President Trump ended President Barack Obama\u2019s appeasement of Iran by exiting the flawed 2015 nuclear deal.Trump also has called China out on its exploitative trade practices and intellectual property theft, using tariffs to press for free and fair trade. The U.S. and China agreed to a \u201cPhase One\u201d trade deal in January that addressed some of these concerns. Trump officials plan to open talks on a broader \u201cPhase Two\u201d deal if Trump wins reelection.The winner of the 2020 presidential election should continue and build upon these policies.As we celebrate the birth of our nation this weekend, we honor an exceptional nation that is a global beacon of freedom, liberty and opportunity.

Good evening, welcome to Washington. I'm Bret Baier. Breaking tonight, President Trump dismisses the stories about intelligence assessments that Russia offered bounties for killing American troops in Afghanistan as a hoax and made up to hurt him and the Republican Party. The President's National Security Adviser is saying today he had a list of retaliatory options if the intelligence had been corroborated. I will ask Secretary of State Mike Pompeo about this story, many other topics around the world in just a few minutes. But first to the lead story from the White House tonight, we begin tonight with Correspondent Kristin Fisher live on the North Lawn. Good evening, Kristin. KRISTIN FISHER, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT: Good evening, Bret. Today for the first time since The New York Times broke the story on Friday, President Trump talked about it on camera and he said if Russia did offer bounties to kill U.S. troops in Afghanistan, he would take action. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I agree with the intelligence people. I think frankly that many of the intelligence people didn't think it was something that even happened. And if it did happen, the Russians would hear about it, and anybody else would hear about it that was involved. FISHER: Today the National Security Adviser confirmed that the intelligence behind to these Russian bounties was shared with U.S. allies. And he pinned the responsibility for the decision to not share that intelligence with President Trump on the President's daily briefer, a career CIA officer. ROBERT O'BRIEN, NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER: She made that decision because she didn't have confidence in the intelligence that came up. She made that call and you know what? I think she made the right call. FISHER: But Democrats disagree. They believe intelligence of this magnitude should have made its way to the president. (INAUDIBLE) as The New York Times and associated press recording, then Democratic Senator Joe Manchin says, not only did the president, quote, fail our service members, but he broke his oath to protect and defend the constitution. It would be unconscionable to think he did not immediately inform Putin that America would retaliate in the most damning way possible. The New York Times is now claiming to have found the money trail behind these bounties to kill U.S. troops in Afghanistan. The paper reports, American officials intercepted electronic data showing large financial transfers from a bank account controlled by Russia's military intelligence agency to a Taliban-linked account. But Defense Secretary Mark Esper says, the Pentagon has no corroborating evidence at this time. Adding, I want to assure all of our service members that we take seriously any and all potential threats against U.S. military personnel. Today, Democratic Senator Bob Menendez introduced an amendment to the Defense Authorization Act to sanction Russian President Vladimir Putin and other top government officials. But the Kremlin calls the claims total B.S. and so does President Trump. TRUMP: I think it's a hoax by the newspapers and the Democrats. (END VIDEOTAPE) FISHER: Now lawmakers from both parties have been calling for a briefing about all of this from people within the intelligence community, not the White House. And tomorrow morning, the Gang of Eight is going to get one from the director of National Intelligence and the director of the CIA, Bret. BAIER: Yes, and the Secretary of State with us in just a moment. Kristin, thank you. The House of Representatives passed a bill to sanction China over their new national security law for Hong Kong. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi saying the purpose of that law is to frighten and suppress peaceful demonstrators demanding freedom. Thousands of protesters defied the law and tear gas on the anniversary of the former British colonies handover to Chinese rule. Hong Kong police responded with the first arrests under the new law. Correspondent Benjamin Hall is following this story from London. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BENJAMIN HALL, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT: Hong Kong police cracked down today both on protesters and free speech. Police fired rubber bullets as they enforce the new security law which gives sweeping powers to China to arrest people for criticizing the government. As crowds marks 23 years since the end of British rule, police held up signs warning of the new law then arrested people who called for Hong Kong independence, or even displayed the British flag. The law is applied to nonresidents and those abroad, meaning it could affect Americans. Carrie Lam, the Chief Executive of Hong Kong tried to defend it. CARRIE LAM, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF HONG KONG: The purpose of this piece of legislation is not just to punish, but it's also to deter. HALL: The U.S. is responding by moving to end special trade terms with Hong Kong and banning defense exports. With Congress moving to impose sanctions on Chinese officials who try to repress political freedoms. The U.K. is extending residency rights and citizenship to up to three million Hong Kongers. And British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has condemned the law. BORIS JOHNSON, PRIME MINISTER OF THE UNITED KINGDOM: It violates Hong Kong's high degree of autonomy and is in direct conflict with Hong Kong basic law. The laws also threatens the freedoms and rights protected by the joint declaration. HALL: The new law is punishable by up to life in Chinese prison. And China will now be allowed to establish security officers in Hong Kong, which means Chinese security forces operating freely on the island. (END VIDEOTAPE) HALL: Observe this note, this new law is a violation of the agreement made with Britain. Effectively the end of the one country, two-systems framework. The end of Hong Kong's autonomy, Bret. BAIER: Benjamin Hall in London. Benjamin, thank you. Federal authorities seized tons of products suspected to be made out of human hair taken from people locked inside Chinese internment camp. U.S. Customs and Border Protection says the goods represent a serious human rights violation. State Department Correspondent Rich Edson has an exclusive television report. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) RICH EDSON, FOX NEWS CHANNEL STATE DEPARTMENT CORRESPONDENT: In this nearly 13-ton shipment seized in New York, hair weaves and extensions from China. The U.S. officials suspect they're made from human hair. Customs official say they're still analyzing the origins of this cargo, though intercepted it based on information indicating prison labor in Xinjiang, China produced it. KEN CUCCINELLI, ACTING DEPUTY SECRETARY, DHS: It is our intention to keep interdicting shipments like the one you saw today in New York that CBP grabbed. We will keep doing that over and over and over. No American wants to buy a product that they find out later was made with slave labor. EDSON: The spokesman for the National Security Council says, quote, if this highly suspicious, 13-ton shipment of human hair indeed turns out to be linked to the Uyghur concentration camps, then this is a new low, even for the Chinese Communist Party. And they will have to answer to the world community for their actions. Officials say the administration is expanding pressure on businesses operating in the United States, urging them to rid their supply chains of products manufactured with forced labor. The federal government has issued an advisory to companies, warning them to monitor their activities in China. MIKE POMPEO, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: CEOs should read this notice closely and be aware of the reputational, economic and legal risks of supporting such assaults on human dignity. EDSON: The notice specifically references Xinjiang, China where officials say the Chinese government has interned more than one million Muslims and minorities like Uyghurs. Subjecting them to surveillance, indoctrination, and forced labor. Last month, President Trump told Axios he held off on sanctioning Chinese officials involved with the Xinjiang mass detention camps because it would have interfered with his trade deal with China. (END VIDEOTAPE) EDSON: But the president has also signed a law directing sanctions against Chinese government officials who were involved in the mass internment camps in Xinjiang. U.S. officials say that Chinese government has located hundreds of thousands of prisoners from those camps to factories across China, Bret. BAIER: Rich Edson live from the state department. Rich, thank you. For more on China, Hong Kong and America's role in the world, joining me now Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Mr. Secretary, thanks for being here. POMPEO: Bret, thanks for having me on this evening. Great to be with you again. BAIER: We just heard you talked about the companies -- American companies warning them to keep forced labor, labor out of their supply chains pointing directly at China and these concentration camps as descried by the Defense Department. Will we see investigations and prosecutions of American businesses who don't heed this warning? POMPEO: Bret, President Trump has been very clear, the way previous administrations have dealt with the Chinese Communist Party by turning the other cheek and letting them abuse America is not going to continue, so we responded across a number of fronts. So you identify one, this forced labor, nobody wants to buy products -- cheap products that were made with slave labor in Western China. They want clarity about the tracing of the product that they have. And so we've asked every business to evaluate their supply chain and make sure that nothing like that ever gets in, and we put them on notice for actions that we may take as we move forward. BAIER: You know, last month, President Trump told Axios that he held off sanctions -- sanctioning Chinese officials involved with the mass detention camps because it would have interfered with his trade deal with China. Should those have been separated? POMPEO: Bret, I've been Secretary of State for 2-1/2 years, no, there's always complex tradeoffs that one has to make. President Trump's been very clear when he signed this bill, the Uyghur bill last week that we were going to take this seriously, we were going to deal with it, we were going to put harsh restrictions in place, we're working on that. No country has responded in the same way that we have. We hope the whole world will join. What's going on there Bret, is historic, there's forced sterilization, forcing women to have abortions, this is a place with some of the most fundamental violations of human rights that the world has seen in an awfully long time. President Trump's been serious about making sure the world sees. And so we hope that countries all across the world, including Muslim countries in the world will see their way clear to putting their shoulder to the grindstone to help resolve this problem as well. BAIER: I guess the question is should the president had done more in a lot of opportunities talking with President Xi? POMPEO: There's no country that has done more, and I'm confident will do more, Bret. BAIER: All right, in Hong Kong, you -- we did a story there about the new security law in place. You've certified that Hong Kong is no longer sufficiently autonomous. Again, should the administration have acted more forcefully to deter Chinese crackdown in Hong Kong? POMPEO: I'll tell you, Bret, I wish previous administration had taken China seriously. It's true, well, this isn't partisan, 40 years of failed American policy with respect to China. This administration is trying to clean it up, trying to get it right. Now the Chinese have taken advantage of us -- advantage of us in multiple ways. We've done really good work, important work trying to protect the freedoms of the people of Hong Kong. General Secretary Xi has chosen to go a different direction, and we're responding in a way that will put pressure on Beijing, and try to maintain whatever we can of the remaining freedoms in Hong Kong. I will tell you the notion that the remains, one country and two systems is fundamentally at odds with the facts on the ground today. I regret that. BAIER: You know that your critics including now John Bolton say that this is all about election politics and to get China to buy soybeans and places that affect reelection. POMPEO: Nonsense. BAIER: OK, that's what we get from that. What does success look like with China, the U.S. and China? What does it look like? Can China be a responsible partner with President Xi at the helm in the Chinese Communist Party? POMPEO: Look, that's up to the Chinese Communist Party, that's their decision to make. What the United States can control is what we do. When there's unfair and nonreciprocal trade, we're going to demand by -- demand that it be right. When they don't do, we're going to do things like placing tariffs on their goods. When they engage in behavior that's militarily threatening to the United States, we're going to put $700 billion into our Department of Defense to keep Americans safe and secure. And when the Chinese engage in cyber espionage, we're going to impose penalties on them so that they will be deterred from doing that. Those are the things we can do. We are hopeful, we want the Chinese people to be successful. The Chinese Communist Party today has made a decision, it wants to be an imperialist power, it wants to be authoritarian in nature and it wants to compete across the world in ways they are consistent with the good things happening for the American people. And frankly, people with democracies all across the world. Presidents Trump's policies are aimed squarely at reversing that. BAIER: I want to spend some time on the Russia bounty story in Afghanistan. First, does the Russian government have American blood on its hands in Afghanistan? POMPEO: Bret, I don't want to get into the intelligence. The intelligence community has put out two statements. I used to have that job; I'm going to -- I'm going to honor what they said. Here's what I can say with absolute certainty, the United States has responded appropriately to the threats that have been presented to it in Afghanistan consistently during my entire 3-1/2 half years. First the CIA director and now as Secretary of State, there are many folks using the Taliban or who have used the Taliban over years and years and years as proxy forces. There's been money funneled in there from all across the world, unfortunately. President Trump has taken this seriously, we are hopeful, we'll make progress on our peace and reconciliation plan. And we will respond to any threat, whether that's Iranians using the Taliban or the Russians, we'll make sure they know. The Russians have been providing weapons to the Taliban for an awful lot of years, and so, this is an ongoing challenge we have. And our forces on the ground under General Miller and the resolute support mission are deeply aware of the threat from the Taliban whether that's supported by any third party or none. BAIER: But you know, you just referenced you were CIA director, there's not often consensus across the intelligence community on Intel. And if it dealt with bounties killing American troops, shouldn't the president have been told about it? We know that it was discussed in the National Security Council, the principles and deck this level. You said today the key members of Congress had that Intel as well, even though there wasn't a consensus. Why wasn't the president briefed on it? POMPEO: Well, Bret, that's not actually quite right. Most intelligence that's red -- there is in fact a consensus. Almost all of the analytical product that I read every day has a consensus across the entire intelligence community. It is often the case that it is not that happens. When that happens, we need to make sure we get it right. But Bret you know this, every morning I wake up, and I read the intelligence materials. And when I read them, there are people all across the world who are threatened, including my officers and embassies all across the world. We don't always make sure that gets to the president, we do the right thing. We make sure the ambassador on the ground knows, that the commander on the ground knows, that our allies who may be threatened as well know. It is the tactical and operational response to keep our soldiers safe and secure that is most important. When the intelligence community feels like something rises to the level of needs to get to the president, I'm very confident they will consistently present it to them. I know that when I was the CIA director, I did that. BAIER: Did you know about this particular Intel piece? POMPEO: You know, I don't want to talk about the Intel in particular on this, Bret. BAIER: All right. POMPEO: I mean, there's just -- I just -- I'm not trying to be clever, there's just so much that has been reported that is not accurate and that is incomplete that by refuting any particular element of it. I'm putting at risk our capacity to actually resolve and figure out what's going on. BAIER: And I want to ask you about that in the leak itself, but here is what the democratic nominee is saying about it. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: He either reads and/or gets briefed on important issues and he forgets it, or he doesn't think it's necessary that he need to know it. He should have a minimum, have picked up the phone and said, Vladimir, old buddy, if any of this is true, and it doesn't cease amigo, you've got a big problem. (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: All right, so, it's not just the Democrats, obviously, you have Senator Chuck Grassley on the Senate floor, saying it demands a serious response. You have two key Republicans in the House. Mike McCaul and Adam Kinzinger, saying, \"There are already those who are politicizing this issue. However, we cannot use let politics overshadow the truth that Republicans and Democrats alike can agree on: The Putin regime cannot be trusted. If the intelligence review process verifies the report, we strongly encourage the administration to take swift and serious action to hold the Putin regime accountable.\" POMPEO: Yes. Bret, there's been no administration to hold the Russians accountable the way this one has. I only wish former Vice President Biden had held the Russians accountable. We've been cleaning up a lot less of a mess. I wish we provided arms to the Ukrainians, I wish he had gotten out of the INF Treaty, I wish he hadn't allowed and invited the Syrians -- the Russians into Syria. I could go on, but you got a short show. The failures of previous administration allowed the Russians a lot of space to move. We've pushed back, we sanctioned more Russians than any other administration in history. I'll take a backseat to no one with respect to what our administration and President Trump has done to hold Vladimir Putin accountable when he is engaged in malign activity. And should we find out that there's evidence that he's putting our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines at risk, anywhere in the world, including in Afghanistan, I am very confident that President Trump will direct me, and he himself will respond appropriately. BAIER: How damaging was this leak? You were CIA Director, the White House press secretary the other day, said that there were rogue officers in the intelligence community who want to undercut the president. You believe that? POMPEO: Bret, I don't know where this leak came from. But when periodicals report this information, it breaks my heart because it puts our intelligence officers and our military men and women at risk. It is -- it is dangerous, it is unlawful, and I hope that we can figure out who did it, and they'll be brought to justice. BAIER: Mr. Secretary, you did speak out when it was alleged that Iran was paying the Taliban $1,000 for each American killed in Afghanistan, as a member of Congress, and you, spoke out about the Obama administration's response at the time, which obviously you criticize in the overall Iran deal. POMPEO: Yes, it's absolutely true. I've spoken about the Iranians providing assistance to the Taliban in my current role as secretary of state as well. I've criticized other governments. We've worked to make sure Pakistan wasn't providing safe haven for the Taliban in Afghanistan too. No, where equal opportunity when it comes to making sure we protect the Americans wherever they're serving. BAIER: All right, let's talk about the couple of other substantive things. One, as you mentioned, the Taliban peace deal. You said that the Taliban would publicly renounce al-Qaeda. You talked about that, I asked you about it back in March. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: It says it will not allow any of its members or other individuals or groups, including al-Qaeda to use the soil of Afghanistan to threaten the security of the United States and its allies. But that's not really a break. That's not a renouncing -- POMPEO: Oh, yes. Oh, yes. BAIER: A renouncing of al-Qaeda? POMPEO: Absolutely. Absolutely, when you say you're not going to let them operate there, you know it, Bret. They've done it for 20 years. They're not going to let them operate it anymore. That's -- that is a central provision. (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: You went further saying that they would eventually take up arms and fight al-Qaeda, working alongside us to destroy al-Qaeda. Have you seen any indication that the Taliban is doing any of that? POMPEO: Yes. BAIER: How? POMPEO: But I can't talk about the things that I have seen, but know this, I spoke with the Taliban, again, just this week and effort to further the peace negotiations to try and get them to the table with the Afghan government. I think we're closer than we were even just a couple of weeks back. The Taliban continued to have pressed upon them the importance of this break from al-Qaeda, and I think we will be able to see when we get to that point, when we have these negotiations commenced, I think the world will be able to see that the Taliban are no longer going to tolerate what they've permitted to happen and that the Pakistanis too will do the things that need to be done to reduce the footprint from al-Qaeda. Remember, Bret, we're down to a couple of 100 active al-Qaeda fighters inside of Afghanistan. The reason we went there in 2001 was to crush al- Qaeda. That has largely been achieved. BAIER: Can you confidently state that America will have U.S. troops in Afghanistan on Election Day? POMPEO: President will ultimately make that decision, Bret. BAIER: OK. One more thing, the E.U. blocking travelers from the U.S. due to the coronavirus pandemic. Your reaction to that, and is there any pushback from the U.S.? POMPEO: Well, remember, we're not allowing Europeans to come here today, either, Bret. We're in close conversation with countries all around the world, including European countries, to make sure that when we reopen our country to travel from their nations. That we do so in a way that keeps American people safer and reduces risk from COVID here in the United States. They have a responsibility to do that for their nations as well. And I'm very confident that we'll get this right with countries all across the world. It's not just the Europeans, we need to get this right, we need to get the economy back up, when you get people traveling all across to the United States, and international travel as well. BAIER: Mr. Secretary, we appreciate your time. POMPEO: Thank you, Bret. BAIER: Happy Independence Day, early. POMPEO: Thank you. Happy Fourth of July to you too, Bret. BAIER: All right, all the best. Up next, California and New York become the latest states to halt the process of reopening. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BAIER: Private payroll processor ADP, found U.S. companies added nearly 2.4 million jobs in June, with small businesses reporting the biggest increase. According to the data, the economy still has about 14 million fewer jobs than it did in February. President Trump is back in more stimulus as part of the recovery from coronavirus, telling Fox Business, he is not -- he not only favors more payments to individuals, but he wants them to be even larger than the first time around. Stocks started the third quarter of 2020 on a mixed note. The Dow dropped 78. The S&P 500 gained 16, and a record high closed for the NASDAQ which finished ahead 96. Here in Washington, the Fourth of July fireworks show will go on with the Trump administration promising one of the largest displays ever. 300 000 masks will be given away on the National Mall. But attendees will not be required to wear them. Other states are pausing the reopening process and mandating masks. Correspondent Jonathan Serrie, looks at the coronavirus trends across the country. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JONATHAN SERRIE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Alarmed by an increase in coronavirus cases, California's governor has announced a three-week closure of bars and restaurant dining rooms. While the mayor of New York City has postponed plans to reopen in restaurant dining. BILL DE BLASIO, MAYOR OF NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK: The news we have gotten from around the country gets worse and worse all the time. SERRIE: Public health officials say large Memorial Day gatherings and complacency over the use of face masks are driving the nation's new spike in COVID-19 cases. Today, an emergency order in Savannah, Georgia, imposed a $500 fine on people who failed to wear face coverings in public. Doctors at Emory University, say mandates are more effective than recommendations based on their own experience in hospitals. JONATHAN LEWIN, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, EMORY HEALTHCARE: When we simply strongly encouraged face masks, we still saw community spread. When we required masks, we saw our infection rates within our workforce plummet. SERRIE: Following a lot of criticism today, President Trump, explained he usually doesn't wear a mask because people who visit the president are tested. DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: If I were in a tight situation with people, I would absolutely be -- (CROSSTALK) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Do you think the public will see that at some point? TRUMP: I mean, I'd have no problem. Actually, I had a mask and I said I like the way I looked. SERRIE: Although the U.S. leads the world and confirm COVID-19 cases, its deaths per 100,000 population remain among the lowest. However, health experts say that's not reason for complacency. DR. CARLOS DEL RIO, PROFESSOR OF MEDICINE, EMORY UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE: I worry less about the numbers right now, and I worry more about the trend. And the fact that we're seeing an exponential growth is really what bothers me right now, and what really makes me very concerned. (END VIDEOTAPE) SERRIE: Public health officials are especially concerned about the upcoming Fourth of July holiday when many people are planning get-togethers, they're urging people to limit the size of gatherings, and to wear face coverings when social distancing is not possible. Bret. BAIER: Jonathan Serrie in Atlanta. Jonathan, thank you. Up next, the end of the chop zone in Seattle and budget cuts for the NYPD. First, here is what some of our Fox affiliates around the country are covering tonight. FOX 4 in Kansas City, where you, the American taxpayer have an almost 30 percent stake in a trucking company that ships military equipment. The Treasury Department will loan YRC worldwide $700 million in exchange for a stake in the company. Congress gave permission to the deal as a way to ensure taxpayer money is not misspent. FOX 7 in Austin, Texas where the U.S. army says partial human remains have been found close to the Leon River in Bell County. In the search for missing Fort Hood soldier Vanessa Guillen. 20-year-old Guillen was last seen on April 22nd, a family attorney says one suspect committed suicide as police closed in on them. Another suspect is in custody. And this is a live look at San Francisco from our affiliate FOX 2 out there. One of the big stories there tonight. Police, say they will stop making mug shots publicly available unless the person poses a threat to the public. The police chief, says the move is part of an effort to stop perpetuating racial stereotypes and protect the presumption of innocence. That's tonight's live look \"OUTSIDE THE BELTWAY\" from SPECIAL REPORT. We'll be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BAIER: In downtown Seattle, the Capitol Hill Organized Protest zone, or CHOP, is no more. Police cleared the area after the mayor declared it an unlawful assembly following two deadly shootings in less than two weeks there. Correspondent Dan Springer reports. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DAN SPRINGER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Acting on the mayor's executive order signed overnight, police officers and FBI agents moved into the area known as CHOP just before 5:00 a.m. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We need to be clear now. If we don't clear out then we'll be forced to arrest. SPRINGER: While most peacefully left, police, some in riot gear, did arrest at least 30 people for offenses including failure to disperse, assault, and unlawful weapon possession. CARMEN BEST, SEATTLE POLICE CHIEF: What has happened here on these streets is lawless, and it's brutal, and bottom line, it is simply unacceptable. SPRINGER: Established in early June in the wake of George Floyd's death, what was initially an overwhelmingly peaceful protest soon became linked to incidents of violence. Black Lives Matter and similar groups had already pulled out, and there was now concern from both protesters and the city that CHOP's original message, a call for police reform, has been drowned out. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We're going to have to work 10 times as hard to get our message back on track. BEST: Black Lives Matter, and I too want to help propel this movement forward, but enough is enough. (END VIDEOTAPE) SPRINGER: Seattle police are back inside the east precinct which they abandoned in early June. The question now is how long they will hold and keep it from becoming of point again as protestors say the idea of CHOP isn't over yet. Bret? BAIER: Dan Springer in Seattle. Dan, thanks. Just after midnight early this morning, New York City's City Council passed the city's $88 billion budget that includes $1 billion in cuts to the NYPD. But that has not resulted in the end of Occupy City Hall protesters. Correspondent Aishah Hasnie looks at the situation in the big apple today. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: As hereby adopted as of 12:26 p.m. -- AISHAH HASNIE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: With ah historic vote, New York City leaders defunded the NYPD's $6 billion budget by close to $1 billion. The 2021 budget cuts include cutting the number of recruits in half, which would save $40 million, and a reduction on police overtime spending by $352 million. And it comes at a time when shootings are up across the city compared to this time last year. The city faces a $9 billion loss due to coronavirus, and police retirements are rising. DERMOT SHEA, NEW YORK CITY POLICE COMMISSIONER: Let's mark the date on the calendar and how long it's going to be before we'll have that conversation about New Yorkers crying out for more police. HASNIE: But some protesters outside city hall and council members feel the budget did not go far enough. They wanted to eliminate school safety officers and introduce a hiring freeze on police. JONATHAN LYKES, BLACK YOUTH PROJECT 100: We're not happy with the budget, let me be clear. We know that they political tricks. HASNIE: Mayor Bill de Blasio said he will continue to support peaceful protests, but the city needs to move forward now. Protesters, though, have a different message for their mayor. LYKES: We're coming for you. We're going to escalate tactics. We're going to be disruptive. (END VIDEOTAPE) HASNIE: And that very same organizer tells me the people in charge of organizing Occupy City Hall will leave now that the budget has passed, but they will continue to support anyone who wants to stay. Bret? BAIER: Aishah, thank you. Up next, the battle over our nation's history ahead of the holiday weekend. First, Beyond our Borders tonight. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announcing a delay in the annexation of parts of the occupied West Bank. The process was supposed to begin today, and still may take place later this month. Several thousand Palestinians peacefully marched in Gaza City to protest those plans. Russian voters approved a package of constitutional changes allowing President Vladimir Putin to serve two more terms, possibly staying in power until 2036. The weeklong vote was tarnished by reports of pressure on voters and other irregularities. Putin, who has been in power more than two decades, did not mentioning his political future during a speech Tuesday and has yet to commit to running to 2024 when his current term expires. And way Beyond our Borders, NASA astronauts replaced batteries on the outside of the International Space Station today. For every two batteries removed, a new one and improved one is installed to power the station while on the night side of the earth. The battery replacement process began in 2017 and should be completed this month. Just some of the other stories beyond our border tonight. We'll be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BAIER: In our Democracy 2020 report, Oklahoma voters narrowly approved a state constitutional amendment to expand Medicaid health coverage to tens of thousands of low-income residents. Oklahoma is the first state to amend its constitution to expand Medicaid. For other states accomplished it through ballot questions. In Colorado, five-term Congressman Scott Tipton lost his Republican primary contest to pro-gun and pro-border wall candidate Lauren Boebert. She will run in November against Diane Mitsch Bush who won the Democratic primary in the district. The Colorado Senate race, meantime, set as well. Former governor John Hickenlooper won the Democratic primary against a progressive opponent and will face Republican incumbent Senator Cory Gardner. The mayor of Richmond, Virginia, the former capital of the Confederacy, has ordered to removal of all Confederate statues standing on city land. This afternoon the of Stonewall Jackson on Richmond's Monument Avenue came down to the cheers of a surrounding crowd. The move comes at a time when the fight over Confederacy symbols takes center stage on Capitol Hill. Congressional correspondent Chad Pergram has the story. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) CHAD PERGRAM, FOX NEWS PRODUCER: Pageantry and imagery defined most Fourths of July. This holiday could ignite flashpoints around the nation's uncomfortable history. There's concern demonstrators could again try to topple controversial statues. KAYLEIGH MCENANY, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: Law and order are the building blocks to the American dream. Anarchy in our streets is unacceptable. PERGRAM: The Department of Homeland Security is deploying special teams to protect federal monuments in Portland, Oregon, and Washington, D.C. President Trump warned people his executive order to safeguard monuments is in full force. That prompted a veto threat of the Senate's annual defense bill if lawmakers stand by a plan to rename bases named after Confederates. SEN. JAMES INHOFE (R-OK), SENATE ARMED SERVICES COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN: He's serious about it. You know the president. He makes up his mind, and he does things. SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER, (D-NY) SENATE MINORITY LEADER: This is nothing but typical bluster from President Trump. At the NDAA will pass. PERGRAM: Still, this bill may not go to the president to sign until fall. SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL, (R-KY) SENATE MAJORITY LEADER: I hope the president would reconsider vetoing the entire defense bill, which includes pay raises for our troops, over a provision in there that could lead to changing the names of some of these military bases. PERGRAM: But members of the Congressional Black Caucus aren't convinced some changes are truly for racial justice, such as Mississippi's decision to mothball its flag with the Confederate emblem. SEN. BENNIE THOMPSON, (D-MS) CONGRESSIONAL BLACK CAUCUS: When SEC, NCAA, the bankers, the richest man in the state who was a Trump delegate said we need to change the flag, boom, it changed. (END VIDEOTAPE) PERGRAM: President Trump believes the culture war over monuments works politically in his favor, but Democrats think that Black Lives Matter tilts the field in their direction. That's why fights over statues and military bases represents a proxy war ahead of November. Bret? BAIER: Chad Pergram live on the Hill. Chad, thanks. Next up, the panel reacts to my interview with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and the big stories around the world, next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: Does the Russian government have American blood on its hands in Afghanistan? MIKE POMPEO, SECRETARY OF STATE: Bret, I don't want to get into the intelligence. The United States has responded appropriately to the threats that have been presented to it in Afghanistan consistently. There are many folks using the Taliban, or who have used the Taliban over years and years and years as proxy forces. I don't know where this leak came from, but when periodicals report this information, it breaks my heart, because it puts our intelligent officers and our military men and women at risk. It is dangerous, it is unlawful, and I hope that we can figure out who did it, and they'll be brought to justice. (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: Secretary of State Mike Pompeo talking about that Russia bounty story in Afghanistan. We'll start there with our panel, Ben Domenech, publisher of \"The Federalist,\" Mara Liasson, national political correspondent for National Public Radio, and Josh Holmes, former top advisor to Mitch McConnell, now president of Cavalry Consultants. Ben, thoughts on his answer, and the story overall. BEN DOMENECH, \"THE FEDERALIST\": First off, I think his answer was as clarifying as he possibly could be in this moment, which is clearly, there's a big muddle here about where this intelligence came from, why it was leaked in the way that it was, and what we are supposed to take away from this situation overall. He is correct that the Taliban has been used as a proxy force in all sorts of different ways. It does seem like this story came out in a way that would undermine the efforts of American forces to figure out what was actually going on in this scenario, and coming at the truth. But I think that that's probably going to lead to a discovery that leads to an indication that this was trying to do something that undermined the president and undermined his overall efforts in the region. BAIER: Clearly the president think so, said it on FOX Business. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, (R) PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: When you bring something into a president, and I see many, many things. And I'm sure I don't see many things that they don't think rose to the occasion. This didn't rise to the occasion. And from what I hear, and I hear it pretty good, the intelligence people, many of them didn't believe it happened at all. I think it's a hoax. I think it's a hoax by the newspapers and the Democrats. (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: Mara? MARA LIASSON, NATIONAL POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, NATIONAL PUBLIC RADIO: Yes, well, Secretary Pompeo didn't say it was a hoax. He was angry that it leaked, I understand that, but I guess the question now is, is this real or not? Did the Russians but a bounty on U.S. troops? And what does the president want to do about it, if anything? So I think that's the next chapter of this. They're going to try to find out who leaked it, that's kind of one problem. But the other one is, if it's true, what is the administration going to do? BAIER: Josh, the national security advisor spoke about the CIA briefer. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ROBERT O'BRIEN, NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER: The person who decided early on whether the president should be briefed on this in Oval intelligence briefing was his career -- senior career civil servant CIA officer. And she made that decision because she didn't have confidence in the intelligence that came up. She made that call. And you know what, I think she made the right call. (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: So there's all kinds of people speculating, did they not want to bring it to President Trump because of what he would think about it, would he tweet about it, would he talk to President Putin in some way, shape, or form about it? That's not what they're saying, Josh. JOSH HOLMES, CAVALRY CONSULTANTS: No, they're not saying that at all. What they're saying is that the CIA and the intelligence services concluded that it wasn't ready for primetime, that in fact it wasn't ready to present the president or congressional leaders, for that matter. I don't think it's difficult to see what's happening here. It was, however, determined fit to print in \"The New York Times.\" And the reason it is fit to leak to \"The New York Times\" is because it goes to this ongoing narrative that Democrats, frankly, cannot let go of, that somehow this president is preferential to Russia. We've gone through three-and-a-half years, tens of millions of dollars in investigations, conclusions definitively that that is not the case, both in terms of policy and in terms of past actions. And yet here we are again debating the same thing. I don't think there's any question in anybody's mind that if we have definitive proof that Russia had bounties on American soldiers that this president is going to act decisively to ensure that that doesn't happen, and they'll have a huge response if it does. BAIER: We mentioned the Iranian bounties on American soldiers in Afghanistan, and reaction of the Obama administration after that, Ben. DOMENECH: So I certainly think that the president would have a very robust response of this. The truth is that, as Josh indicated, we've had all of these allegations put out there, including by this current Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, who continues to engage in this ridiculous campaign where she suggests that Vladimir Putin has some of kind of thing over on the president. It's ludicrous, it's laughable. But it is a situation where I think when issues like this arise, we want to have clarity. And I think in this case, we don't really have clarity about what went on here, and we may not be able to have clarity because of the way that this story played out. BAIER: Meantime, the COVID situation, the news about the cases around the country and spikes in different states, Mara, the president speaking out that he's OK with masks. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, (R) PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I'm all for masks, I think masks are good. I would wear -- if I were in a group of people and I was close -- UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You would wear one? TRUMP: I would. I have. People have seen me wearing one. If I'm in a group of people where were not 10 feet away, but usually I'm not in that position. And everyone's tested. Because I'm the president, they get tested before they see me. But if I was in a tight situation with people, I would absolutely. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Do think the public will see that at some point? TRUMP: I'd have no problem. Actually, I had a mask on. I sort of liked the way I looked. (END VIDEO CLIP) (LAUGHTER) BAIER: Mara, listen, there are, on the serious side of this, Mara -- LIASSON: This is a new, this is -- BAIER: There's the economic guys that are looking at this saying, if you're pro-mask and you don't shut down, you could save the country a lot of GDP percentage that might go down if there's another shutdown. LIASSON: There's been some pretty studying estimates that masks help the economy, because you can go back to work with them. This is a new message from the president than the past. He suggested to the \"Wall Street Journal\" that people who wear masks are doing it to show their disapproval of him. He said to a reporter at the White House, you're wearing a mask because it's politically correct. So it sounds like the White House is changing its tune on masks. The question is, will the president start wearing one, not because he needs it to protect himself or others in the White House, but to model this behavior as something that other people should do. BAIER: And how much will he talk about COVID and be a part of the task force? There's all kinds of questions coming up with the politics. Panel, thank you so much with the secretary's interview. We'll stop there. Appreciate it. When we come back, the brighter side of things, some good news. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BAIER: Finally tonight, when life gives you lemons, you try to make lemonade, right? Well, that was the case for a five-year-old Cooper Wallweber when he heard that a volunteer firefighter was injured in a shooting at a local restaurant, he felt compelled to do something good for her. The Missouri boy got to work making and selling lemonade, raising more than $3,000 from his lemonade stand to help her out. Good job. Princess Paige Lemonade is well known in some neighborhoods around Minneapolis. Its founder, six-year-old Paige, sells lemonade in stores around the Twin Cities. The young entrepreneur donates the profits to the Ronald McDonald House for Families living near a sick child getting treatment, and sometimes Paige visits those kids who are dealing with the medical issues, and of course she shares her lemonade. So there you go, making lemonade out of lemons. Thanks for inviting us into your home tonight. That's it for the SPECIAL REPORT, fair, balanced, and still unafraid. \"THE STORY\" hosted by Martha MacCallum starts right now.

This action is intended to send the world a message: Fear us.The free  response should be to man up.Beijing\u2019s action came after recent U.S. legislation calling for sanctions on Chinese officials over their systematic abuse of the Uighurs and other Muslim minorities. We\u2019re talking about systematic and horrific  violations, including the mass detention of over a million Chinese citizens, religious persecution, exploitation of slave labor and forced sterilization.Last week, these inhumane practices led the Trump administration to impose sanctions on four individuals, including Politburo member Chen Quanguo, the highest-ranking Chinese official ever called out by Washington. Chen is also Party secretary of Xinjiang Province, where the Uighur detention camps are located.\u00a0The other three officials sanctioned are also tied to Xinjiang.China announced its \u201c\u201d on Monday. Three of those targeted are Sens. Ted Cruz,\u00a0R-Texas,\u00a0and Marco Rubio,\u00a0R-Fla.,\u00a0and Rep. Chris Smith,\u00a0R-N.J., who led the legislative efforts to punish Beijing. Also named by Beijing were U.S. Ambassador for International Religious Freedom Sam Brownback and members of the Congressional-Executive Commission on China.This is not just Beijing playing tit-for-tat with Washington. The Chinese action comes on the heels of  that significantly restricts the economic and political freedoms long enjoyed by the people of Hong Kong. The Chinese regime has also engaged in an aggressive diplomatic and propaganda effort during the COVID-19 crisis, evading responsibilities for its own failures, while threatening other nations for not siding with China.The highly hostile approach now being pursued by Beijing is popularly called \u201cwolf warrior\u201d diplomacy. The moniker refers to a series of Chinese films in which a Rambo-like character runs around the world thwarting \u201cevil\u201d capitalist designs.The real question is whether wolf warrior diplomacy is an act of strength or weakness. After all, the Soviet Union unveiled their Rambo-esque character in a film which premiered less than four years before the evil empire collapsed.But no matter whether it driven by insecurity or overconfidence, China\u2019s increasingly intimidating stance is a problem the United States will have to deal with.America\u2019s response ought to focus on the target for Beijing\u2019s temper tantrum \u2014 and it is probably not America. In practice, China has had no luck bullying this administration. From increasing freedom of navigation operations in the South China Seas to upping support for Taiwan, action on trade and calling out Beijing\u2019s abuse of the World Health Organization, when Beijing has pushed, the U.S. has pushed back harder.America can get away with bumping heads with Beijing. We are a superpower.China\u2019s sanctions aren\u2019t so much designed to push against an immovable geo-political object as they are trying to flow around U.S. power and intimidate others. There is little likelihood, they\u2019ll ever try to extradite Cruz or Rubio.\u00a0No, they want to send a message to others.Kicking sand in the face of American officials is the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s not-so-subtle warning that they are willing to go after anyone who gets in their way \u2014 and the weaker and meeker their opponents are, the harder China will squeeze.When it comes to battling wolf warrior diplomacy, the free world has to stand together. Otherwise China will use its divide-and-overwhelm strategy to pick the free world apart.Standing together will require American leadership, and it deserves strong, bipartisan support here at home. This is an issue where contemporary Washington politics of \u201cif Trump is for it, we are against it\u201d must be put aside. If we can\u2019t pull together on this one, we can\u2019t lead.Next, we are going to have to tell our friends and allies the hard truth: a country that wants to be part of the free world must stand with the free world in pushing back China\u2019s destabilizing actions that undermine our security, prosperity and values. They are going to have to carry their fair share of the load.Finally, we have to make the free world stronger. The tougher we are to take out, the more likely China is to back down.

But immediately, suspicions were raised that the data was being used to ascertain who had the healthiest organs for \"donation.\"\"This selection was purely racial: over half of the population of Xinjiang, the Han Chinese, were exempt from the medical tests,\" Gutmann said.In a testimony provided to Fox News via the London-based World Uyghur Congress, Uighur gulag survivor Omer Bakari said he underwent his first round of forced blood and urine sample, along with an eye and full-body exam, at a Pichan police station in late March 2017. He said the following month\u00a0he was made to undergo a second exam at a hospital before \"being thrown\" into a Karmay prison where he was beaten with a whip and surrounded by others in the community who were left \"hanging like meat\" in cells. He suspects he was being tested as a potential candidate to be organ-plucked.Similarly, Gulbahar Jelilova, 46, stated that she was seized by Chinese authorities in May 2017 after traveling to Urumqi, the capital of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, to pick up a shipment of goods for her exporting business.She alleged that she was then coerced into making a false confession that she had transferred money to a Turkish company she had never even heard of, and pledged that throughout her 15-month incarceration the women were all given tablets that stopped their menstrual cycle, and that she\u00a0at one point early on was stripped naked for a medical examination.Canadian human rights lawyer David Matas, who has extensively studied the illicit organ harvesting issue, highlighted that at Kashgar airport in Xinjiang, there are even signs in various languages signifying the route for transporting organs to the aircraft for exportation abroad. Photographs  in September 2018 show \"priority lanes\" for this very purpose.Adding to the obscurity surrounding the possible targeting of the Uighur Muslims is the emergence of reports indicating that many who go to China for life-saving organs come from the wealthy Gulf States; thus the demand for \"halal\" organs \u2013 from bodies untouched by dietary choices such as pork and from those who have followed a diet in keeping with the tenants of Islam \u2013 are in demand.Gutmann asserted that while there are no known advertisements for \"halal organs,\" the phrase has become a useful shorthand for several pieces of evidence,\" which includes documentation of \"gulf state organ\u00a0tourists in Tianjin Central Hospital, the worlds largest transplant center.\"\"Go back a few years, and the foreign entrance to the hospital website politely asked if you preferred to continue in English or Arabic,\" he continued. \"More recently, at least one Chinese hospital openly advertises to the world that it has a very nice\u00a0Muslim prayer room and a halal restaurant.\"While experts say the most significant market is domestic, organ shoppers hail from\u00a0far and wide.\"The biggest customers are wealthy or politically connected local Chinese,\" Matas said. \"The biggest foreign customers are now Japanese, South Koreans, and Saudis.\"Salih Hudayar, prime minister of the East Turkistan Government in Exile, pointed out that \"Uighur prisoners have also been transferred to Heilongjiang Province near the Korean border; it is known that Korea is a big market for organs.\"But getting to the bottom of the matter is profoundly challenging for outside investigators, given the widespread suppression in Xianjing.More than one million Uighurs are estimated to be \"disappeared\" into concentration camps \u2013 what Beijing refers to as \"re-education camps\" and a necessary national security tool against Islamic extremism. Moreover, victims'\u00a0bodies are quickly disposed of \u2013 family members are typically told that their otherwise healthy loved one died suddenly and are under close supervision by authorities when they view and bury the body.Nonetheless, China has repeatedly denied the use of unethical organ transplant practices, maintaining that it stopped using the organs from executed prisoners in 2015.Officials have accused the China Tribunal of perpetuating \"rumors.\"Yet a probe published in the  journal in November accused China of \"systematic falsification and manipulation of official organ transplant datasets\" to obscure just how few voluntary donors had registered, compared to how many transplant surgeries occurred.Sometimes referred to as \"medical genocide\" by activists, the fast and furious transplant trade is estimated to make some $1 billion a year for the Beijing back pocket.\"One or two of China's hospitals could have matched the average of about 6,000 liver transplants performed annually in the entire United States since 2000,\" stated the U.S.-based , which claims to have combed through hundreds of transplant hospitals in China and their revenue, bed counts, bed utilization rates, surgical expertise, training programs, state funding and more, for its findings. \"While Chinese officials claim that the country performs about 10,000 transplants a year, this annual figure is easily surpassed by just a few hospitals. Based on government-imposed minimum capacity requirements, the 164 approved transplant hospitals could have conducted more than 70,000 transplants per year.\"Chinese medical authorities boast that the country performs the most transplants in the world \u2013 surpassing the 40,000 that happen annually in the U.S. \u2013 but the circumstance of its \"voluntary\" nature remains murky.\"Most Chinese are reluctant to donate their organs given their traditions, so we believe that forced organ harvesting is still continuing. We highly suspect that it is happening in East Turkistan due to the fact that many of the bodies of victims who died in the concentration camps and prisons haven't been returned to their families,\" noted Hudayar. \"In the instances that the bodies were returned their families, there were visible stitches on parts of the bodies like the kidneys.\"He also emphasized that thousands of Uighurs \"were secretly transferred to prisons inside Chinese provinces like Henan,\u00a0where there are five known Chinese hospitals\u00a0that have been implicated by researchers for being involved in organ harvesting.\"\"Given its record on religious freedom, we have no reason to trust Communist China's denials,\" contended Gary Bauer, commissioner for the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF). \"The government's lack of transparency is in itself very revealing.\u00a0Unfortunately, most victims of this outrageous practice die as a result, so they are not able to speak about their suffering.\"But despite grave concerns being voiced by the international community as it pertains to possible organ harvesting and the Uighurs, no country nor international agency is yet to actually take on a formal investigation and prosecutorial process.The U.S. State Department and the Chinese Embassy in Washington did not respond to further requests from Fox News for comment.", "comment": "", "topic": "China", "date": " July 28"}, {"cover": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/07/156/88/Scott-Hawley-AP-Rick-Scott-Getty.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "title": "Scott touts Hawley bill to ban TikTok on government devices as it heads to Senate floor", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/politics/hawley-scott-ban-tiktok-government-devices-senate", "subtitle": "Sen.

Trump himself said more closures could be coming if China didn't change its behavior. \"It's always possible,\" he told reporters at the White House.Pompeo similarly hit that theme. \"Just think how much better off the world would\u2019ve been if the doctors in Wuhan had been allowed to raise the alarm about the outbreak of a new coronavirus,\" he said.The State Department announced it ordered the consulate closed within 72 hours after alleging that Chinese agents have tried to steal data from facilities in Texas, including the Texas A&M medical system statewide and The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston.There were indications consulate staff were preparing to leave: Papers were being burned on the consulate grounds late Tuesday night \u2014 a common practice when a diplomatic post is being shuttered on short notice.Cai Wei, the Chinese consul general, told KTRK-TV in Houston the order to shut down was \"quite wrong\" and \"very damaging\" to U.S.-China relations.Asked about accusations of espionage and stealing data, Cai said, \"You have to give some evidence, say something from the facts. ...

The assessment is supported by partners at the Canadian Communication Security Establishment (CSE), the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the Cybersecurity Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)\u00a0and the National Security Agency (NSA).\u201cIt is completely unacceptable that the Russian Intelligence Services are targeting those working to combat the coronavirus pandemic,'' U.K.'s Foreign Secretary  said in a statement. \u201cWhile others pursue their selfish interests with reckless behavior, the U.K. and its allies are getting on with the hard work of finding a vaccine and protecting global health.''The NCSC made the announcement in a press release, where it claimed\u00a0\u201cAPT29\u2019s campaign of malicious activity is ongoing, predominantly against government, diplomatic, think-tank, health care and energy targets to steal valuable intellectual property.\u201d \u201cWe condemn these despicable attacks against those doing vital work to combat the coronavirus pandemic,\u201d Paul Chichester, NCSC's director of operations,\u00a0said in a statement. \u201cWorking with our allies, the NCSC is committed to protecting our most critical assets and our top priority at this time is to protect the health sector.\"Chichester also urged\u00a0\"organizations to familiarize themselves with the advice we have published to help defend their networks.\u201dThe NCSC said they are more than 95 percent certain that APT29 is part of the Russian Intelligence Services. It also assessed it is highly likely \u2013 between 80 and 90 percent \u2013\u00a0that this activity was to collect information on COVID-19 vaccine research or research into the COVID-19 virus itself.The persistent and ongoing attacks are seen by intelligence officials as an effort to steal intellectual property, rather than to disrupt research. It was unclear whether any information actually was stolen but the British center says individuals\u2019 confidential information is not believed to have been compromised.Cozy Bear, also known as \"the Dukes,\" has been identified by Washington as one of two Russian government-linked hacking groups that broke into the Democratic National Committee computer network and stole emails ahead of the 2016 presidential election. The other group is usually called Fancy Bear.The NCSC has previously warned that APT\u00a0\u2013\u00a0which stands for Advanced Persistent Threats \u2013\u00a0groups have been targeting organizations involved in both national and international COVID-19 responses. It said known targets of APT29 include British, American and Canadian vaccine research and development organizations. Officials claim the group uses a variety of tools and techniques, including spear-phishing and custom malware known as \u201cWellMess\u201d and \u201cWellMail.\u201dThe statement did not say whether Russian President  knew about the vaccine research hacking, but British officials believe such intelligence would be highly prized.U.S. authorities have for months leveled similar accusations against China.

More than 2,000 passengers from the same administrative zones arrived in March and an additional 150 in April, according to The AP report.There is no sufficient evidence to show people from these flights transmitted the coronavirus, but the National Security Council, the State Department, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) would not publicly comment on why these\u00a0territories were exempt from the China travel ban.One administration official told The AP\u00a0that the travel ban was instated after more than 12,000 people arrived in the U.S. through the two territories in January, according to Commerce records. The Trump administration said it would also require any Americans who have traveled through China and back into the U.S. to undergo a 14-day quarantine period.But according to data collected by The Associated Press, the system that was meant to track and monitor the people undergoing quarantine lost track of at least\u00a01,600 Americans.Trump has touted his border closures, first from China, then European nations and\u00a0Brazil, as the U.S.\u2019s first line of defense against the coronavirus.In a tweet last week. the president said:\u00a0\u201cWe did a great job on Coronavirus, including the very early ban on China.\u201d\u201cWe saved millions of U.S. lives!

Watch this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Trump voters were long-suffering; analysts say often silenced.GREG MYTROSEVICH, OHIO TRUMP VOTER: A lot of people kept quiet about a lot of things.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: So you don't say it in the polls, you don't say it to anybody else, but you show up and in the voting booth you go Trump.JOHN BRABENDER, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST: They're not answering the phone and telling people publicly they're voting for Donald Trump.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: Could some new numbers tonight from the libertarian think tank, the Cato Institute suggests that Americans are still, in fact even more so now, keeping their politics to themselves. Look at these numbers. 62 percent say that today's climate prevents them from talking about what they believe with anybody. By a large margin, those who identify, though, as very liberal. This is the group who feels the most free to speak out among friends, family, whatever, about their politics.So what exactly does this tell us about the state of the 2020 race? And what is America's growing frustration with cancel culture as an adjunct to that tell us? Marc Thiessen and Marie Harf are here to debate tonight.Also, as Bret mentioned, my exclusive interview this evening with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who just delivered a blistering message to China's communist leadership, calling on the Chinese people to perhaps consider a different path than the communist government that leads them. We're going to break that down and talk to him about exactly what he said about that.That, as China says they are not going to leave the embassy in Houston. We will get for the first time the Secretary of State to respond to them, digging in their heels at that embassy in moments.Then after that, K.T. McFarland is here with her analysis of the Pompeo interview. What's - are we in a cold war with China now? Is China been a failed experiment since 1979? All that with Katie.But we start tonight with Marc Thiessen, American Enterprise Institute Scholar and Marie Harf, Executive Director of Serve America PAC. Both are Fox News Contributors. Great to have both of you here tonight, Marie and Marc.It strikes me every time we have anyone on from the Trump campaign, we show them the latest numbers. Tonight we just showed everybody the latest numbers from Michigan, Minnesota and Pennsylvania. And they always say, look, we don't care. The polls aren't right. There's a lot of secret Trump voters out there, which we saw in a Monmouth poll last week in Pennsylvania. But Marc, it makes it very difficult to gauge where the country is at right now.MARC THIESSEN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Yes. Well, they probably overstated, especially these new Fox News polls show a big gap. It's probably not as big a gap as the polls show. So I don't think Democrats should get too excited about it.But I think that - and questionably there are secret Trump voters. In fact, there was a poll - Monmouth poll in Pennsylvania, that 57 percent of the voters there were pretty sure that some of their neighbors were planning to vote for Trump, but weren't saying it.And there's a reason for that. There's the cancel culture as it has taken hold in a way it has in recent months. I mean, think about this. Is it more or less hospitable environment for a Trump supporter to express their support for the president now than it was four months ago? I think not. So, I think that - I think there are a lot of people who won't tell a pollster that they're supporting Trump and - but are really going to vote for him in the ballot box.MACCALLUM: I think it's fascinating. And when you look at that number, 62 percent say that they do not want to share their political feelings with anybody. And back in 2017, three years ago, that number was at 58 percent. So we've seen increase, Marie, in the people in the country who are just saying, I'm not going to talk about it. I'm keeping my decision to myself.MARIE HARF, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Yes, Martha. And every Democrat, I know is running like Joe Biden is 10 points behind for this exact reason. People were very confident in 2016 that Hillary Clinton would win. We know there was a hidden Trump voter then in many of these swing states that the Fox News poll spoke to today like Michigan or Pennsylvania, where Donald Trump won by very little in 2016.So Democrats are worried about this. They really want to act like they're running from behind. I think these numbers do concern the Trump team, though. And I also think it's a really polarized time in our country. I mean, there are people on the other side of the aisle who've told me that Democrats hate America, and they hate Christianity. And that kind of language, even four or five years ago wasn't really out there. So our country is really deeply divided. We see that every day and it's a real problem. I don't know how to fix it. There's no easy answer.MACCALLUM: Yes. I want you to take a look at some of these other numbers, because they are disturbing. I mean, let's pull up this one. 32 percent worry about their jobs, because if their political opinions become known, they're concerned that they could lose their job.Look at this next one. Do you think it's OK to fire someone who supports Trump or Biden? In other words, if at your job it became known that you had given money to Joe Biden or who had given money to Trump, they support firing you. 50 percent of those who consider themselves very liberal, Marc - I mean, just think about this. So they support - they think that person should be fired from their company, that's a very disturbing number.THIESSEN: Well, it's insane and the reality is--MACCALLUM: I don't know what country--THIESSEN: --that it just show how polarized our country has become. But let's keep in mind - that I agree with Marie that there are some Republicans who say things that are overwrought about Democrats like saying that they don't love America. I condemn that.But the reality is, if you look at that poll, Republicans are more worried - there are more Republicans who are worried about expressing their views than Democrats by 25-point margin. The only group that feels that it's - that has - a majority feel confident about it, saying what they what they believe are staunch liberals.And the reason for that is, because there really isn't a penalty for being a liberal or for expressing staunch liberal views. You're not going to get in trouble at work for saying Black Lives Matter. You will get in trouble for saying blue lives matter. There will be repercussions for that. So I think there is - this cancel culture is going after the Right in a way that it's not over the Left. And we should condemn it whether it goes after conservatives or liberals.MACCALLUM: Yes. I also thought that deeper in that number, the 62 percent, who say that they don't feel comfortable talking about who they support politically, 59 percent of independents said that. So - I mean, these are the people who elect presidents and we don't know, which side they're on when you look at that number. But 59 percent of independents, Marie, said that they did not want to discuss who they will vote for or who they support.HARF: Yes, these numbers are really interesting, and I agree, disturbing in many ways. And Donald Trump as an election strategy hasn't gone after independents. He's really tripled down on his base. We've seen that with his rhetoric and his policies. And so, I don't know where those independents will break.In the polling we've seen from Fox and others, they're breaking towards Democrats and they certainly broke towards Democrats in 2018.MACCALLUM: That's interesting.HARF: But cancel culture is on both sides. Right? Like I'm not on Twitter--MACCALLUM: Is it?HARF: --because I was bullied off of it by conservatives. So it's on both sides and it's not good wherever it is.MACCALLUM: Yes.THIESSEN: Get back on Twitter, Marie, no one should believe you. I won't stand for it.MACCALLUM: It's disgusting what happens these days there.HARF: Thank you.MACCALLUM: Thank you very much, guys. Marie, Marc, great to have you. Lots more to talk to you about, but we'll pick it up next time. Thank you for being here tonight.So China digs in its heels now. This is a reflection of the burning of documents at that consulate in Houston. Now they say they're not going to leave the United States. So we asked Secretary of State Pompeo what he plans to do about that? Next.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MIKE POMPEO, SECRETARY OF STATE: Securing our freedoms from the Chinese Communist Party is the mission of our time, and America is perfectly positioned to lead it because our founding principles give us that opportunity.(END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)MACCALLUM: Are China and United States at a crossroads that could lead us into another Cold War? Perhaps even a Cold War decade. In a speech today at the Nixon Library, Secretary Pompeo said this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)POMPEO: The CCP fears the Chinese people's honest opinions more than any foe, and save for losing their own grip on power, they have reason - no reason to.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: That as China's General Consul in Houston tells POLITICO today in an interview that they do not plan to leave their Houston consulate.Here now exclusively to respond to that and lots of other things today is Secretary of State. Mike Pompeo. Mr. Secretary, thank you very much for speaking with us today.POMPEO: Martha, it's great to be with you. Thanks for having me on.MACCALLUM: Thank you. So let's start there. The consul in Houston says that they do not have plans to leave that consulate right now. What's your response to that?POMPEO: While everyone knows the rules for diplomats. You're only permitted to be there in a diplomatic status with the consent of the host nation. And so, I'm confident, we've had private conversations as well.I'm very confident that we'll proceed in a way that makes clear that it's not OK to use your diplomats to engage in industrial espionage. It's not OK to steal intellectual property. It's not OK to engage in those kind of behaviors. That's the reason we did it. We did it to protect the American people. And we're going to make sure that that happens.MACCALLUM: I guess, the question - they say that you're - that United States is abandoning the Vienna Convention and also violating the China- U.S. consular treaty. You, obviously, think that they've already violated both of those. But literally, physically, what if they say, we will not leave, what will the United States do?POMPEO: Yes. Martha, I'm not going to speculate. We're going to make sure that we protect the American people. President Trump began to talk about this threat back in 2015 in this campaign, and you're seeing his administration begin to do the things that will lead to make sure that the American people are safe and secure.And that the jobs that depend on American intellectual property aren't lost to theft from Chinese diplomats that sit in a place in Houston, Texas with great access to American scientific knowhow and business value.MACCALLUM: There is discussion that China may retaliate by asking us to leave one of the six embassies that we have in China. We also have one in Hong Kong. And it looks like Chengdu and potentially Wuhan are at the top of that list. Will we be vacating any of our embassies in China, Mr. Secretary?POMPEO: Martha, let's go back to first principles. The first principles are this, for 40 plus years now - and this is why I'm at the Nixon Library today. For 40 plus years, America has turned the other cheek while we've watched the Chinese Communist Party engage in activity that's fundamentally not fair to the American people, it's not reciprocal for the American people and it doesn't have the transparency we need, so that we can engage with China in a way that's fair for our people and provide security for people. That's what we're aiming to do.And so this decision about the consulate that was made is consistent with all - whole bunch of other actions that we have already taken. A whole bunch more that we're going to continue to do until we get the change.I talked about President Nixon saying that the important thing was that we could induce change from China. That's the mission set the President Trump has set our course on. So whether it is the indictments that have been handed down by the Department of Justice, or the decisions we've made with respect to Hong Kong.All of those are aimed at inducing change inside the Chinese Communist Party for the simple purpose of protecting the American people. And so the Chinese government will get to make its decisions about our diplomats their inside of China. We will make sure that we do right by the American people.MACCALLUM: So, I mean, it sounds like you're saying that this is a very ruptured relationship. And, if I'm reading too much in to take from that, but it - we may, yes, we may pull out of embassies in China that might be part of this process.POMPEO: Yes, Martha I talked today about actions, not words. I was in Honolulu, just a few weeks back. I met with Yang Jiechi. We had a wonderful discussion. But in the end, what matters are actions, the things that make sure that we protect the American people. President Trump's trade deal was a good first effort. That the Phase 1 trade deal is important. If we get that right, that'd be the beginning of a basis for us to expand a fair and reciprocal set of trading relationships.But look at our diplomatic relationship today. They have many more diplomats here in the United States than we have inside of China. And their diplomats here in the United States have much more freedom of movement, and much more access that our diplomats do in China - inside of China.MACCALLUM: Yes.POMPEO: All we're asking, Martha, all we're asking is we want it to be fair and reciprocal. And that's the aim of President Trump. It's what we're going to accomplish.MACCALLUM: So you talked about the sanctions that we have, there's military exercises that have also become somewhat more prominent in the region. We have two hackers that just received indictments. Are we in a Cold War right now with China? And if we're not, it certainly looks like we are.POMPEO: General Secretary Xi has clearly taken actions that are aggressive and broken promises that are central to how great power nations behave. Remember he made a promise back in 2015 in the Rose Garden with President Obama. He said he wouldn't militarize the South China Sea. You can go look, there's now significant military activity there by China.He made a promise to the people of Britain, to the people of Hong Kong that they would have a 50-year deal of one country two systems. He busted it. He broke it. United States is simply demanding that if the Chinese Communist Party wants to be considered in the League of Nations that have great power and great roles and great importance, they've got to behave according to promises that they make and the rules that have been set out for sovereign nations to preserve freedom for their own people.That's what we're seeking to see happen. Label it what you must. But President Trump understands that the previous administrations, both Republican and Democrat alike, turned the other cheek for an awfully long time.MACCALLUM: Yes.POMPEO: And resulted in a real imbalance in the relationship between the United States and China. We aim to fix it.MACCALLUM: I spoke to trade advisor Peter Navarro on this program several weeks back. And I said is the trade deal basically over? And he said, yes, it is. He walked that back a bit. But, it appears that it is. Is that fair to say at this point?POMPEO: No, I'm hopeful that the Phase 1 trade deal we've complied with by both sides. The Chinese Communist Party tells us that they're going to fulfill their commitments. We have every expectation that they will, and our task will be to verify that they've done so. We hope that they do. And if they do, perhaps there'll be an opportunity to build on that.And what we're not going to let happen is what we've allowed to happen before, is that they make a set of promises, they make a commitment, like the Phase 1 trade deal and then they try and they do a little bit and America calls it good enough. President Trump is not going to permit that to happen. We're going to hold them accountable for the promises that they make, MarthaMACCALLUM: President Trump just said moments ago, that that trade deal is not as important to him anymore as it once was.POMPEO: I understand that. I completely understand it. When you see what the Chinese Communist Party has done to our country and to the world with their failure to live up to another set of promises they made to the world about their responsibility if a pandemic began to break out of their country, the cover up that took place. You can absolutely understand why a trade deal like the Phase 1 trade deal no longer ranks first among all the various issues we have with the Chinese Communist Party.MACCALLUM: Yes.POMPEO: We've seen across the world, hundreds of thousands of deaths. Trillions of dollars in economic destruction wrought on this world, because the Chinese Communist Party failed to live up to some basic commitments to the world.MACCALLUM: You made a very strong appeal to the Chinese people in this speech, basically calling on them to call for a new form of government in China. Are you encouraging them towards regime change? And you said that we would encourage and empower - engage and empower. How will we do that? What - how do we play that role? What will that look like?POMPEO: Martha, I talked about several things. One of which is there are 1.4 billion Chinese people. And what I wanted to make clear in my remarks today is we want good things for them. They've raised hundreds of millions of people out of destitute, poverty, we think that's a good thing. We're not trying to contain the prosperity for the people of China. We're simply trying to preserve freedom for the people of the United States of America. That is the American task.President Trump, when he was sworn in, and I - when I was sworn in as Secretary of State, that's the promise that we made. And so what we are concerned about is not holding China down, but making sure that we all get this right, so that we can have a prosperous economy here in the United States of America, and that we can hold them accountable in ways that preserve and secure freedom for the American people. That's the mission.So when I talk about the Chinese people, I'm talking about making sure that they have the opportunity to participate on a fair and reciprocal basis, in the same way that we expect the American people will.MACCALLUM: I guess - but if I'm the government of China listening to what you're saying, it sounds like you are encouraging the people of China to rise up, to create a different - to push for a different form of government. And we see what's happening in Taiwan where they have a genuine fear that they might be invaded or attacked by the Mainland.You look at what's happening in Hong Kong, where they are experiencing a diminishment all the time of their independence. So those are very provocative words to the Chinese government to say we want your people to push for a new form of government.MACCALLUM: Martha, that's not what I said. Go back and reread what I talked about. This was a speech about the American perspective and the need for a global alliance of freedom loving nations. This is what we're demanding.We know that the Chinese Communist Party has a different system. They still have obligations to live up to promises, promises even that they make to their own people. Our task is to preserve freedom and security for our people. And we know we need partners to do that. We know we need friends.I was in London and Copenhagen just the last two days, talking to them about this. The whole world is beginning to see that when you bend the knee to China, that bad things happen to your own country. So I have every expectation what the whole world, indeed freedom loving people all around the world must demand that the Chinese Communist Party live up to the commitments that it makes.MACCALLUM: You talked a moment ago about - your obvious concerns about this virus and the origins of this virus. Today in the United States we passed 4 million cases, which is obviously a milestone that is difficult for everybody to hear. Nancy Pelosi, the Speaker of the House said that the President calls it the China virus. She said that she is calling it the Trump virus as a result of the President's handling of this virus. What do you say to that, sir?POMPEO: One ought not to make a virus that has had such devastation in United States a political matter. What one ought to do is to call out the people and places that resulted in this virus getting out of Wuhan, China. There's no mistake. There's lots to dispute about the precise origin of this virus. We'd love to know the answers to that. But sadly, the Chinese Communist Party has prevented that.But we know it came from Wuhan. We know they closed down Hubei Province, but didn't close down traveled to the rest of the world. That has caused enormous harm to the United States of America. So this is indeed a china virus. It emanated from there. Make no mistake about it. It is not political. It is factual.MACCALLUM: Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, thank you very much. Good to have you with us this evening. Thank you for your time, sir.POMPEO: Martha. Thank you.MACCALLUM: Former Deputy National Security Advisor K.T. McFarland on where all of this is leading the United States and China. Next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)MACCALLUM: Strong word tonight from Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. He says essentially, Richard Nixon was right when he wrote in 1967 that the world cannot be safe until China changes. And now the United States faces that turning point once again, here he is moments ago.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)POMPEO: --talked about President Nixon saying that the important thing was that we could induce change from China. That's the mission set the President Trump has set our course on. So whether it is the indictments that have been handed down by the Department of Justice, or the decisions we've made with respect to Hong Kong.All of those are aimed at inducing change inside the Chinese Communist Party for the simple purpose of protecting the American people.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: Former deputy national security advisor for the Trump administration. K.T. McFarland joins me now. She's the author of Revolution: Trump, Washington, and We, the People.\" K.T., good to see you tonight. Your thoughts on with the secretary of state had to say there.K.T. MCFARLAND, AUTHOR, \"REVOLUTION\": You know, this is a really significant interview you just had with him and it's a really significant event. And here's why it's important.Forty-nine years ago this month, Richard Nixon, President Nixon directed his national security advisor to go to China and open up relations with China, to bring China into the world.I was a young staff aide to Richard Nixon and Henry Kissinger at that time. I remember this as if it was yesterday.And that set American foreign policy with China in a certain direction for 50 years. And President Nixon was right. He said we will induce them to change. Our thoughts, Republican and Democrat alike was that as China modernizes, as China comes into the world, as they develop a middle class, they will be an open society, an open economy, an open society, but that's not how it turned out.The Chinese in fact have exploited that. And that's why Pompeo was at the Nixon Library today, because he is indicating we now have a reverse. We are now -- we are now acknowledging the fact that the Chinese have stolen intellectual property rights, have militarized the South China Sea, have unleashed a bio weapon onto the world, have practiced wolf diplomacy and so, we, the Trump administration with the United States we're going to have a very different approach to China going forward and that's exactly what he was telling you.And, Martha, I also thought it was interesting when he mentioned to you that he was in Copenhagen, he was in London.MACCALLUM: Yes.MCFARLAND: And he was talking to America's allies about getting the coalition together so we together stand up to China.MACCALLUM: And what does China's coalition look like?MCFARLAND: China has never had very many allies. I mean, their vision of the world and the world that they really want to impose on the rest of us is China is the superpower, China is going to be, they think, the world's major economic political, military, diplomatic power. And then China will determine what everybody else does.And you step out of line for a minute, you try to -- you try to challenge China, you try to go against China and you get crushed. The Australians, for example, the Australians had the temerity to say let's just investigate what happens with the pandemic, with the coronavirus and China turned around and tried to crush their exports, their barley and wheat exports to China. China has, they play with really elbows out sharp. There is President Trump says they are ruthless in their negotiations.MACCALLUM: Yes. Well, I mean, they've essentially someone say they've been buying friends in Latin America, in Asia, in Africa, we know helping with aid and all of that. So, it will be interesting to see if there is a cold war period that we are entering how everything lines up.Secretary Pompeo said we must engage and empower the Chinese people. And he was very careful to say that he is not calling for regime change in China, and yet, you can see these seeds of rebellion in Hong Kong wanting to stay independent, and in Taiwan saying to the rest the world, you know wake up.MCFARLAND: Yes.MACCALLUM: You know, we could be invaded.MCFARLAND: Yes. And I thought that was also really significant what he told you, because he was sort of talking about regime change but he really wasn't talking about regime change.I think that the pandemic, Hong Kong, the South China Sea, these has been a slap in the face in the world and I think it's a wake-up call to the rest of the world. And so, we are not criticizing China, the Chinese people. We are criticizing the Chinese Communist Party which runs China right now which is accumulated more and more power and is a dictatorship, really of President Xi Jinping who is now going to be president for life of China.MACCALLUM: It's fascinating to watch. And it reminds me so much of the Cold War with Russia, we're even in the space race.MCFARLAND: Yes.MACCALLUM: This time it's to Mars, the Chinese against the United States.So, K.T., thank you very much.MCFARLAND: There you have it.MACCALLUM: Great to see you as always.MCFARLAND: Thank you, Martha. Thank you.MACCALLUM: So, the CDC has just released new guidance on how to reopen our schools saying that COVID-19 poses low risk to school age children echoing the sentiment of President Trump today. We are going to talk to a panel of educators with decades of teaching experience about what they think this should look like when we come back.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Fortunately, the data shows that children are at lower risk from the China virus very substantially. When children do contract the virus, they often have only very mild symptoms or none at all.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: Fox News alert tonight. The CDC has just released their guidance for reopening schools this fall. The headline according to the CDC, this virus poses, quote, \"low risks to students and teachers,\" therefore face masks and social distancing are the best defense.Quote, \"the best available evidence from countries that have opened schools indicates that COVID-19 poses low risk to school age children. Reopening schools creates opportunity to invest in the education, well-being and future of one of America's greatest assets, our children, while taking every precaution to protect students, teachers, staff, and all their families.\"Tonight, we are joined by three teachers, all with different opinions about whether students can safely return to the classroom. Leigha Phillips teaches high school English, Krista Herrin teaches kindergarten and first grade special education, and Phil Strunk teaches middle school social studies.Great to have all of you with us today.Krista, let me start with you, teaching kindergartners, how do you feel about the fact that, you know, they say some very young children don't even need to do the mask part necessarily?KRISTA HERRIN, KINDERGARTEN & FIRST GRADE TEACHER: I have a lot of concerns going into the school year. Kindergartners love to share, they love to share toys, they love to share hugs and they love to share germs. And I think it's going to be really difficult for us to keep masks on kids and social distance in a small classroom. I don't have any windows in my room, so I'm just pretty nervous about how things are going to go this school year.MACCALLUM: So, how do you feel though about the statistics that show that it's -- you know, the transmission is very low among children and that the risk according to what we see in other countries appears to be very low in terms of -- even studies that have been done that show that their transmission to other people appears to be very low, that doesn't reassure you?HERRIN: It's reassuring but at the same time, here in the United States, we shut down before we had any chance to spread germs in the school. So that's my big concern is, we don't know. I mean, there are other countries that are showing that, but I just worry when we get closer to the fall and the winter with more illness, that we are going to see a lot more illness.MACCALLUM: Phil, what do you think about those guidelines?PHIL STRUNK, MIDDLE SCHOOL TEACHER: Regarding the guidelines whenever I look at them, I am, you know, it's comforting to see that students under age 10 we're not really seeing a high transmission but it's the number for students over age 10.The New York Times came out with an article that said we're spreading it -- or sorry -- 10-year-olds are spreading it at about the same age as adults. We are working in schools now where like the state of Pennsylvania, that a nurse to student ratio is 1500 to one. That guideline was set back in the 40s. In my home state of Virginia, it's over 800 to one. And the CDC guidelines are 750 to one.MACCALLUM: Yes.STRUNK: We're not exactly set right now to be able to combat this whole currently uncurable virus.MACCALLUM: But Phil, let me ask you this. Because, you know, looking at a chart here that shows the flu deaths in the country. So right now, we're at 30 children under 15. Thirty children under 15 have died, most of them had complicating factors and obviously no one wants to see any child die from any disease in this country.STRUNK: Sure.MACCALLUM: If we can prevent it we of course want to do everything we can. However, the average over the past 10 years of children who died because of the flu every year is 511. And we do not shut schools down from, you know, November to January every year because of the flu.STRUNK: Right. You're absolutely right, we don't shut it down during the flu. One of my big concerns right now is students passing it on to educators like myself. I'm coming home to a wife and we are expecting our first child this November.The CDC has also pointed out that women that are in their third trimester of pregnancy are at huge risk and that's where she's going to be. I think of teachers that have taught with that are overcoming cancer and a lot of other illnesses. And for me, you know, I want the economy open just like everybody else, I want to eat meals with my friends. I want to be able to stand next to a student whenever they're struggling with something.I don't think you're going to find any teachers who are going to say I don't want to be back in school. But for me, my value on human life is much higher than the need to currently open up the education system in an in-person format. Schools didn't close last spring, you know, teachers continue to work tirelessly.MACCALLUM: Yes.STRUNK: And we'll continue to work tirelessly this fall.MACCALLUM: Leigha, what do you think?LEIGHA PHILLIPS, HIGH SCHOOL ENGLISH TEACHER: I mean, I agree with a lot of what they are saying especially if I were working with the young kids, I'd be concerned. I've got a nine, four, and 2-year-old, and I know that keeping their hands to themselves and keeping masks on can be hard so I really empathize especially with our elementary school teachers, middle schoolers aren't much different in all honesty.Just like Phil said, I am worried about my high school kids transmitting it whether it's between themselves, giving it to me and me taking at home, me giving it to my elderly grandma. So, I would love to be in school and I would love to see a hybrid work but that takes a lot of work and a lot of resources that not all districts have and are able to do in such a short time.MACCALLUM: I mean, we've had, you know, the whole summer, or really since March to be adapting to this, there's been hundreds of millions of dollars that went out in the CARE Act to help schools get ready for this and prepare.One of the things that President Trump said had to do with, you know, reallocating money if the schools choose not to open in the face of these guidelines, here's what he said about that.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: If schools are not reopened, the funding should go to parents to send their child to public-private, charter, religious, or homeschool of their choice.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: So, Krista, some schools will open, should parents have the option to use the tax dollars that are allocated to their child to send them someplace else that is open if they want them in school?HERRIN: I think that it's a parent's choice as to where they want their child to go and what they feel would be the best for their family. But I know that more public educators they want the best for what their student needs and they want them to be safe. And so, no matter what the outcome is, the community needs to come together and support the teachers that are trying to do their best.MACCALLUM: What about remote learning, Phil? We've heard a lot that over all, especially for children in urban environments, in inner-city environments, that remote learning has been a failure.STRUNK: Yes, remote learning is going to be challenging no matter what, and I think the other teachers on this panel would agree with me whenever I'd say none of us would suggest remote learning or anything like that because it's easier or better for students, we all know being in a classroom with kids is what's the best option.MACCALLUM: Yes.STRUNK: But again, we're facing an unprecedented time with this pandemic that's killing thousands of people. At this point, I think in the interest of safety, that kind of has to take the top priority, that way we can bring more students back into the classroom in the safe format.MACCALLUM: What about, Leigha, before I let you go, quickly if you can, you know, these studies that show that kids are actually they are in more danger in school than they are staying home. There's instances of abuse, there's difficulties at home, there are things that you don't pick up on necessarily if you don't get to see that child in school every day, does that danger outweigh the virus?PHILLIPS: It's a hard question --(CROSSTALK)STRUNK: I think, you know, they aren't --MACCALLUM: Leigha, if you can. Thanks.PHILLIPS: Yes.STRUNK: Sorry.PHILLIPS: I'm not sure you can weigh -- I'm not sure you can weigh what's more important, a life or a life filled with pain and abuse. I mean, it's a valid point, and it's a concerning point. I know my colleagues and I are all concerned with, but I think there gets to be a point when society and the community has placed too much of a burden on schools to be the police of what's happening, to be the counselors, to do all of these different things.I think that employers, I think the community, and I think all stakeholders need to have an impact on that and need to step up and kind of fill in the gaps where kids are going to struggleMACCALLUM: Yes.PHILLIPS: -- because their life isn't worth it.(CROSSTALK)MACCALLUM: A lot of -- a lot of people are very concerned, you know, if they stay home for another semester or God forbid to the whole school year, all of the loss of learning could be devastating, it could really set a lot of these kids back for a long time.So, I thank you all for your dedication and for sharing your thoughts with us on this today. Leigha, Krista, and Phil, all the best to you as you head forward towards the school year.PHILLIPS: Thank you.MACCALLUM: Thank you very much.STRUNK: Thank you, Martha.MACCALLUM: Thank you.So, coming up, there has been a lot of talk about a violent crime surging in Chicago and New York, but the city of Detroit is also seeing a 29 percent increase in homicides this year. Detroit based Pulitzer Prize winning journalist Charlie LeDuff on whether the feds need to protect his city, next.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: Well, I'm going to do something, that I can tell you. Because we're not going to let New York, and Chicago, and Philadelphia, and Detroit, and Baltimore and all of these -- all cleaned. It's a mess. We're not going to let this happen in our country.(END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: Chicago should be calling us and so should Philadelphia and Detroit and others, to go in and really help them. Because when you're losing many people a weekend, many, many people, you see the same numbers as I do. When you're losing these people, they should call us and they should say come on in.And it's incredible to me but they're not doing it. At some point, they will. At some point we may have no other choice but to go in.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: So, with violent crime on the rise now in Detroit as well, President Trump hinting that it could be among the cities that receive some help from federal officers under the new Operation Legend that was announced yesterday.Homicides there are up 29 percent, and you know, good estimates. I think our next guests will tell us it's higher than that. Nonfatal shootings are up 52 percent over the same period last year, and over the weekend, there were 33 shooting incidents leaving 26 people injured and seven dead.Charlie LeDuff has covered Detroit extensively, he's a Pulitzer Prize winning journalist and says that the increase in crime is historical. He is the author of \"S Show\" there you go. \"This Country is Collapsing but the Ratings Are Great.\"Charlie, always good to see you. Thank you very much for being here.CHARLIE LEDUFF, AUTHOR, \"SH*TSHOW\": The title is still true, Martha.MACCALLUM: So, is the -- what's the answer here? Who needs to come in to help the situation in Detroit, what's the mayor doing about it?LEDUFF: What are they doing about it? First of all, we've had five mass shootings in two weeks, two quadruples, two quintuples, and a nine tuple. So, I don't know what this package is that the president is sending. Are you sending 10 agents? A 100 agents? A thousand? Because our own chief of police says he needs another thousand cops at least.So, we've entered into agreements with them -- they haven't really work what we have task force. ATF, FBI, DEA, the relationship between the Detroit police and the DEA is rotten, it's done. The chief threw them out because of an informant in January who went on a rampage and killed six people. So, I'd like to see some specifics. They had a relationship, now they don't and it's a political year so, I don't even -- I'm not even buying this.MACCALLUM: What's life like now in Detroit for people who live there?LEDUFF: What's it's like?MACCALLUM: Yes.LEDUFF: They are scared and they are angry and they want help. And I don't -- nobody seriously thinks you should defund the police because as we talked about before, we've already done it and look what's happening. And remember, in the next couple of days, those $600 super unemployment checks run out, then what happens?MACCALLUM: So, you heard the president, you know, he talks about sending help. Right?LEDUFF: Yes.MACCALLUM: You say that the police aren't doing their job because they are afraid of the ramifications, you talk about sending in state troopers. You know, what do you think having lived there and worked there and watched all of this, is there a solution that's going to make people safer on the streets?LEDUFF: I think we're in for a slog here, I think you know it and I think the country knows it, the police do do their jobs, there's not enough police to do it and some are afraid to do it. But just last week they pulled 106 guns off of 117 arrestees. Guns are everywhere, what could the governor do? She's not even talking about it, right? She's busy tweeting with the president.Madam, put the state police on the major thoroughfares in the city, seven- mile, six-mile, McNichols, Finco (Ph), five-mile, Telegraph, let them patrol the main boulevards so the police can be in the neighborhoods. That's one way to do it. We've got more state troopers than the president is sending federal agents.MACCALLUM: So, she's way ahead in job performance, she's at 64 percent. President Trump is at 45 percent in Michigan, what do you say about that before we go?LEDUFF: Well, we don't have a very rabid media in this state. You, I think we'll all notice she's got a lot of softball questions. She doesn't get good marks for the nursing homes, she hasn't addressed that. The Senate today voted to take COVID positive people out of nursing homes and have their own facilities.MACCALLUM: That's a good idea.LEDUFF: It's bipartisan. And she's threatening to veto it. And I got to go, Martha. That's all the time I have.MACCALLUM: All right, Charlie, thank you. Come back soon. Always good to talk to you. Best of luck.LEDUFF: Thank you.MACCALLUM: More of The Story coming up next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)MACCALLUM: You don't want to miss this in the latest episode of the Untold Story podcast.

On Tuesday, the  \u00a0that\u00a0warned U.S. companies could face \"reputational, economic\u00a0and legal risks\" for involving themselves with those types of entities.President Trump appointed Krach,\u00a0former CEO of DocuSign, in 2019 to serve as Undersecretary of State for Economic Growth Energy,\u00a0and the Environment.Earlier this week, he sent a letter to business leaders, alerting them to China's detention of ethnic Kazakhs, Kyrgyz\u00a0and Uyghurs. \"The People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) government is perpetrating in Xinjiang some of the most serious acts involving mass human rights abuses since the Second World War,\" he .He added that \"[t]he aim of the internment has been to force members of these minority groups to renounce their ethnic identity and religion, and to embrace the ideology of the Chinese Communist Party.

Though most of the gear purportedly produced through Uighur forced labor was distributed domestically, some Chinese companies that participated in the work transfer program also sent out shipments on the global market to countries, including the United States. At least one shipment was sent to a medical supply company in Georgia from a factory in China\u2019s Hubei Province, where more than 100 Uighur workers were assigned, according to . The work transfer program involves shipping Uighur workers from their homes in the Xinjiang region to factories and other service jobs. They are required to learn Mandarin and pledge their allegiance to China at weekly flag-raising ceremonies.Before the pandemic struck, just four companies in Xinjiang made medical-grade protective equipment, according to China\u2019s National Medical Products Administration. By June 20, at least 51 companies in the region produced medical-grade PPE. Of those 51, at least 17 participated in the state-run labor program involving Uighur workers, the Times reported, citing state media reports and public records. Chinese state-run media has publicized the program as helping to lift Uighurs from poverty by giving them a form of employment and eliminating religious extremism. But penalties and quotas imposed by the Chines government suggest that participation in the program is involuntary.This comes as British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab on Sunday accused Beijing of \u201cgross and egregious\u201d human rights abuses against its Uighur population in China\u2019s western province of Xinjiang.\u00a0Raab said that while Britain wants good relations with China, it could not stand by amid reports of forced sterilization and mass education camps targeting the Uighur population in Xinjiang.\u201cIt is clear that there are gross, egregious human rights abuses going on.

Thank you for joining us. Welcome to \"Sunday Morning Futures.\" I'm Maria Bartiromo. Crime, coronavirus and China dominating the headlines this morning, as Congress scrambles to hammer out the next federal stimulus package before millions of Americans lose their extra unemployment benefits at the end of the month, all this against the backdrop of the 2020 election now just 99 days away. President Trump canceling all GOP events in Jacksonville, while asserting himself as the law and order candidate, dispatching officers to Portland, as well as more force in Seattle and Chicago. Just ahead, acting Secretary of Homeland Security Chad Wolf is here to tell us what the federal government is doing to restore safety to our nation's cities, as protesters target his own home. This as newly declassified documents reveal the FBI used counterintelligence briefings as a cover-up to investigate the Trump campaign. Senator Lindsey Graham is here with the very latest on his Russia deep dive, as he prepares to grill former Attorney General -- assistant General Sally Yates before the committee on Wednesday. We're joined this morning by Congressman Devin Nunes with more breaking news on the Steele dossier. He will reveal it right here for the very first time coming up. And in the middle of all of this, Beijing busted this week for spying on U.S. soil, after three Chinese nationals were arrested trying to steal medical research, a concern you heard here from Senator Tom Cotton, flagging this on this program in April. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. TOM COTTON (R-AR): I have little doubt that the Chinese intelligence services are actively trying to steal America's intellectual property as it relates to the virus that they unleashed on the world, because, of course, they want to be the country that claims credit for finding those drugs or finding a vaccine, and then use it as leverage against the rest of the world. (END VIDEO CLIP) BARTIROMO: Global investor Ray Dalio is back with us today with his assessment of the China threat and why it hasn't stopped him and others from investing there. All that and a lot more, as we look ahead today on \"Sunday Morning Futures.\" But, first, new revelations this week about Christopher Steele and his bogus dossier paid for by Hillary Clinton's campaign and the Democratic National Committee. Newly declassified documents providing even more evidence that the FBI knew that there was no collusion as early as January of 2017, but they kept investigating Trump and his campaign anyway and renewing warrants to do so. This just the latest domino to fall, with more bombshell documents expected any day now. White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows breaking that news right here with us right here last week. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MARK MEADOWS, WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF: We know that they not only knew that there wasn't a case, but they continued to investigate and spy -- and, yes, I use the word spy -- on Trump campaign officials, and, actually, even doing things when this president was sworn in, and after that, and doing it in an inappropriate manner. You're going to see a couple of other documents come out in the coming days that will suggest that, not only was the campaign spied on, but the FBI did not act appropriately as they were investigating. It's all starting to come unravel -- to unravel. And I tell you, it's time that people go to jail and people are indicted. (END VIDEO CLIP) BARTIROMO: Joining me right now to talk more about that is Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham. Mr. Chairman, it's great to have you once again. Thank you so much for being here. SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-SC): Thank you. BARTIROMO: A big applaud goes to you for declassifying documents over the last week and really getting to the news and the truth. Thank you, Senator, for doing that. I know that our audience is grateful. GRAHAM: Thank you. BARTIROMO: I want to talk about what you declassified. And, certainly, you have articles in this from The New York Times, where we see Peter Strzok, FBI agent... GRAHAM: Right. BARTIROMO: ... marking off the articles, saying there is absolutely no evidence of this. Tell us about the report that you declassified from the FBI which is based on an interview with the subsource of Christopher Steele. GRAHAM: So, there's two things that we declassified so the public could understand how corrupt Crossfire Hurricane actually was. Number one was a memo written by an intel analyst who spent three days interviewing the Russian subsource. I don't know about you, but I always thought the Russian subsource was somebody based in Russia in the bowels of the Russian government risking their lives, trying to get information out to the Democratic Party. The Russian subsource, we now know, was on the payroll of Christopher Steele. And he also had a working relationship with the Brookings Institute. And we have learned from the memo that we declassified that the Russian subsource, who was American-based, not Russian-based, told Christopher Steele: Here's what I have got. It is bar talk. It's rumor. It is innuendo. It is not really reliable. And what did Christopher Steele do with that? He turned it into a Tom Clancy novel. He sold it to the FBI. They sold it to the FISA court to get a warrant against Carter Page. And what does this memo show? Then, in January 2017, when they found the Russian subsource, who was in the United States, he disavowed the dossier as being reliable. The FBI knew it, did a 40-page memo. But the FBI continued to lie to the court, getting new warrants based on the dossier in April and June of 2017. After they knew it was a bunch of garbage, they continued to use it anyway. Somebody needs to go to jail. BARTIROMO: So, tell me about the criminality, because... GRAHAM: Yes. BARTIROMO: ... if that subsource told the FBI agent, this is all bar talk... GRAHAM: Right. BARTIROMO: ... this is all hearsay... GRAHAM: Yes. BARTIROMO: ... why didn't the FBI stop renewing warrants to spy on Carter Page? GRAHAM: That is the central accusation that I'm trying to find out. I'm doing oversight. Durham is doing a criminal investigation. Here is what I can tell you, that Peter Strzok new that the subsource was not reliable. In the notes that we declassified where Strzok is commenting on the February 14 New York Times article, he indicates in there that Steele does not have insight into the reliability of the subsource. So, that tells me that Strzok knew about the interview with the subsource in January, where the subsource says it is all bar talk and hearsay. So, Strzok has a duty to report to the court exculpatory information. He has a duty to notify his superiors that the key document to get a warrant against Carter Page, the Russian dossier, is no longer reliable. I find it impossible to believe that McCabe and Comey were not made aware of this 40-page memo. Think about it for the moment. What's the odds that somebody would go to the trouble of writing a 40-page memo, shredding the reliability of the Russian dossier, and not tell other people in the FBI about it? I think there's zero chance that happened. And anybody that knew that the Russian dossier was unreliable and continued to get a warrant against Carter Page based on that document should go to jail for defrauding the court. BARTIROMO: So, you are calling witnesses down to get interviewed in front of your committee. GRAHAM: Yes. BARTIROMO: You have got Sally Yates coming soon. GRAHAM: Yes. Right. BARTIROMO: Are you going to call Jim Comey and Andrew McCabe? GRAHAM: Yes, absolutely, at the end. But I want to call Sally Yates. But let me tell you who I want to call for sure, is, I want to call the person who prepared the memo. I want to call the case agent who interviewed the subsource for three days in January and ask him, oh, by the way, did you tell anybody above you that the dossier is a piece of Russian disinformation? They're laughing their ass off in Russia. This New York Times article that somehow the subsource has been compromised, nobody in Russia is mad at this subsource who is U.S.-based, because the subsource took a bunch of Russian disinformation, sold it to Christopher Steele, who sold it to the FBI. What happened here is that Russian disinformation was used by American law enforcement in weapons form to go after a sitting president. They're laughing their ass off in Russia about this. They would give this guy a medal. BARTIROMO: Mm-hmm. So, tell me about the Sally Yates interview. That is happening on August 5. GRAHAM: OK. Right. Right. BARTIROMO: That is coming up. What do you want to find out from Sally Yates? GRAHAM: Three things. Three things. Ms. Yates has previously testified that she met with President Obama and Vice President Biden, I think it was Comey and Brennan and a few others, to talk about the ongoing surveillance of General Flynn, who was the incoming national security adviser. At that meeting, she learned for the first time -- and she is number two at the Justice Department on January the 5th, 2017 -- that the FBI was surveilling General Flynn. What shocked her the most is that Obama knew about it, and she didn't. Now, what do I want to ask her? I want her explain to us, how is it possible the president of the United States knows about a surveillance of the incoming national security adviser, General Flynn, and you didn't? And did she hear Vice President Biden mention whether or not Flynn may have violated the Logan Act? And I want to under -- I want her to explain to us what kind of system is in place? On January the 4th, the FBI agents in the field recommended dropping General Flynn from Crossfire Hurricane because there was no there there. So, really, what I want to hear from Flynn is, how could Obama know and she didn't? And did Biden mention that we should be looking at Flynn in terms after a Logan Act violation? If he said that, that is contrary to what he has been saying publicly. BARTIROMO: Well, what did they also say -- what did the FBI say to Congress? Because I remember John Brennan being interviewed... GRAHAM: Stay tuned. (LAUGHTER) BARTIROMO: ... in testimony to -- in front of Trey Gowdy. GRAHAM: Yes. Yes. BARTIROMO: And he said to Trey Gowdy, we did not use the dossier. It was a small part of the overall mosaic. GRAHAM: Right. BARTIROMO: What about the FBI and what it told Congress? Is lying to Congress a 10-year felony, as Trey Gowdy has said on this program? GRAHAM: So, stay tuned. Next week, you are going to learn more. Not only do we now know that the FBI lied to the FISA court about the reliability of the dossier. They told the court that the subsource was truthful and cooperative and Russian- based. The truth of the matter is that the subsource was American-based. He was an employee of Christopher Steele, who was on the payroll of the Democratic Party. And he told Christopher Steele, this is all a bunch of hearsay. And when the FBI understood that the dossier was no longer reliable, they continued to use it. But we also now have found -- and this will come out next week -- that Congress got suspicious about the Russian subsource and the reliability of the Steele dossier and that members of Congress asked to be briefed about it. I will tell you next week what I found. And here is what I think I'm going to be able to show to the public. Not only did the FBI lie to the court about the reliability of the Steele dossier. They also relied -- lied to the Congress. And that is a separate crime. BARTIROMO: So, that is a second criminal -- that is a second criminal act, then? GRAHAM: And this is in 2018. So, again, I want to emphasize this, that the Congress got suspicious, the Intelligence Committee did, about Steele and the reliability of the dossier. The intelligence community did not want to include the dossier in the intelligence assessment provided to President Trump about the 2016 campaign because they didn't trust it. So, they started asking questions at the FBI in 2018 about the subsource and how reliable this information was. And I found the notes that the FBI used to prepare that briefing. Mr. Horowitz told us about them. I found them. Stay tuned next week. You're going to find, not only did the FBI lie to the FISA court. They lied their ass off to the Congress. BARTIROMO: Unbelievable. This is more breaking news. We will follow your reporting next week, Senator. (LAUGHTER) BARTIROMO: Real quick, before you go, you have been knee-deep on working on another package for the shutdown and the coronavirus response. GRAHAM: Yes. Right. BARTIROMO: Are we going to see you pass something before the Senate leaves on August 8? What is the conversation now about those unemployment benefits, which will go away on July 31? GRAHAM: Well, here's the problem we have. Seventy percent of the people, almost, on unemployment are making more unemployed than they did when they worked. We need to change that. State benefits are trying to replace 50 percent of lost wages. What Mnuchin wants to do is have a federal benefit to take it up to 70 percent. Our goal is to give you 70 percent of the money you lost by being employed, not to give you a pay raise in unemployment. We have got to fix that. We have got to take care of kids. We have got $100 billion in this package to safely get kids back to school. And hospitals are beginning to be overrun again by new admissions. So we have got money to help our health care system. Half the Republicans are going to vote no to any phase four package. That's just a fact. And a lot of Democrats are going to insist on $3 trillion, which would be way too much. It would be wasted money. I'm confident that President Trump will lead us to a solution where we have money for kids, jobs, and health care. We need to stimulate the economy. We need a phase four. And I think we will come together before August the 5th to get this done. BARTIROMO: All right, we will leave it there. We will be watching. Lindsey Graham, thanks for your leadership in all of this. We appreciate your time this morning, sir. Thank you. GRAHAM: Thank you. BARTIROMO: Senator Lindsey Graham joining us there. A quick break, and then coming up, acting Secretary of Homeland Security Chad Wolf is here live on what the federal government is doing to do to restore law and order across our country, with some mayors saying they're just not welcome. Back in a minute. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Crime and vandalism besieging downtown Portland overnight, as the city enters a 60th straight day of often violent protests over the death of George Floyd. President Trump deployed federal officers there to restore law and order, facing opposition from local lawmakers who are demanding they leave. Acting Secretary of Homeland Security Chad Wolf has been leading the federal response in Portland. He joins me right now. And, Secretary, it is great to have you this morning. Thank you so much for joining us. And, certainly, your leadership on all of this is critical. Please explain to us the difference in terms of what is happening in Portland vs. the response to other cities across our country where there is also crime and vandalism and in need of law and order? CHAD WOLF, ACTING U.S. SECRETARY OF HOMELAND SECURITY: Well, thanks for having me on this morning, Maria. What's going on in Portland is very different than any other city across our country today. What we have in Portland is, every night, again, between midnight and 5:00 a.m., you have anywhere from 2,000, 3,000, upwards to 4,000 violent individuals targeting federal property, the federal courthouse there in Portland and federal law enforcement officers. They are arriving every night, using city streets and city parks. They're coming armed with rocks, bottles, basketball bats, power tools, commercial- grade fireworks, eliciting that violence, and targeting their violence on federal courthouse and federal law enforcement officers. That is very different than what is going on in Chicago -- places like Chicago, Albuquerque, Kansas City. That is where you see normal criminal activity, street crime, what we say, regarding gangs and drug dealers. And, again, President Trump and the administration, led by the Department of Justice, is targeting that type of crime. But, again, Portland is very different. What we see in Portland is a city, at least at certain hours of the night, completely out of control. We see city leadership there has fostered an environment that allows these criminals to do this throughout the night, untouched, absolutely untouched. It is time for Portland to join other responsible cities around this country, working with federal law enforcement, to address this violence. Just last night, Maria, we had protests across the country. We had some violent protests taking place in Seattle, in Oakland, in other cities. But what we saw there is, we saw local and state, federal law enforcement -- working with federal law enforcement, addressing those issues, without major incidents. We need Portland to step up to the plate, do their responsibility, and work with us to address violent criminal activity occurring every night. BARTIROMO: Well, what if they don't, Secretary? Something has got to give, right? This is going on every night that Portland looks like Baghdad. And they are pushing back on officers. These people can go all the way up to the fence and the perimeter and throw bricks at officers. What are you going to do about it? WOLF: Absolutely. Well, I will say that we're working very, very closely with the Department of Justice, the FBI, as well as others. And I will say that we are going to have additional actions probably as early as this week. We cannot continue to let law enforcement officers targeted and injured night after night after night. And I just want to say, we often hear from, again, city leaders and even other leaders, Oregon senators, who say there is not a lot of violence going on, it is mainly peaceful protesting. I would say to you, that we have over 70 arrests. We have over 188 individual injuries. We have got over a dozen times it has been declared a riot that says otherwise. This is violent, violent activity. We have got dozens of pictures, photos, videos, some of which we released, that say the complete opposite. So, I think it is very important that Americans and your viewers understand what is going on in Portland. It is violent crime every single night. And, again, I'm asking the city, the state to step up, do their job, work with federal law enforcement, and let's bring this to a peaceful conclusion. BARTIROMO: Yes. WOLF: And let me just end by saying the department strongly supports individuals who want to peacefully protest. You want to exercise your First Amendment right, there is no concern. In fact, that happens in Portland every day. There's no incidents. There's no arrests. And we're fine. It is this violent criminal activity that has to stop. BARTIROMO: Yes. And you may actually have two of your agents permanently blind, God forbid, because they were -- they had lasers shined in their eyes. I want to take short break and come back and talk about that, as well as a protest planned right outside of your house. Stay with us. More with Secretary Chad Wolf when we come right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BARTIROMO: Welcome back. We are back live with acting Secretary of Homeland Security Chad Wolf. Secretary, we were just going through the situation in Portland. I want to get to the other major cities in our country and the violence happening there. But why can't -- before we finish on Portland, why can't you just arrest the leadership in Portland because of their ignoring what is really happening on the ground? WOLF: Well, we absolutely are doing that. So, we're working with the FBI there in Portland, with the U.S. attorney's office there in Portland, to address the leaders that are organizing this and then going after them. We're also making arrests every night. We made more than seven or eight arrests last night. And we will continue to do that. We're continuing to hold these criminals accountable. If the city won't, the federal government will hold these folks accountable. And I think it is interesting. I have often been asked by a number of city officials, as well as, again, senators, who say, just have DHS officers stay on federal property. If you stay on federal property, all will be fine. We did that Friday night, Maria, and over seven officers were injured on federal property. So, this has nothing to do with, you stay on federal property, and then we will peacefully protest. That is not the case. We know what their aim is. Their aim is to destroy that courthouse and injure law enforcement officers. We have them on video as saying that. We know what their goal is. And we're going to continue to protect and do our job. BARTIROMO: Right. How are your officers doing, your agents doing who are -- have lost eyesight because of the lasers shone at their eyes? WOLF: Yes, well, I appreciate you mentioning that. We have two to three different officers. We are waiting on final results to see how much their eyesight will permanently be lost because of the activity of these criminals. As you indicated, they are shining lasers, high, powerful lasers into officers' eyes as they emerge from the courthouse. So, we're taking steps, we have taken steps to address that. And we will continue to protect our officers at all costs. And, again, all I need is the city of Portland to step up and do their job. These individuals are on city streets. They're in city parks, arming themselves every night. And the city simply does nothing about it, absolutely nothing. BARTIROMO: Unbelievable. WOLF: It is irresponsible, and it is very dangerous. BARTIROMO: And right now, there are plans for a protest right outside of your home. What are you doing? What can you tell us about this other protest which is really trying to single-handedly attack you? WOLF: Well, what I can tell you, Maria, is, our officers in Portland every night are targeted. Their personal information is on the Internet, put out there by these criminals, by these anarchists. They're identified. Their families are harassed. They go where they're staying. The doxing is prolific. And we're trying to address that. And, of course, we see them trying to do that to myself. We will continue to do our job. We are not going to be deterred by this. This is tactic they have used for over three years, three-and-a-half years. We know what it is. We're prepared for it. At the end of the day, we're going to do our job, we're going to do our mission. The American people deserve that. And, again, I go back to the -- most reasonable Americans understand what is at play in Portland, understand what the department is doing, what the president is doing and what the administration is doing. And that is, we are standing up for law and order. And anyone who says otherwise is not being accurate. And I will say that the other -- the other side that wants to criticize law enforcement, what they don't do, they do not condemn these acts of violence in Portland. I have talked with a number of Democratic members of Congress. And all but one... BARTIROMO: Right. WOLF: Only one have asked me about the health of my officers. All they want to do is condemn law enforcement for doing their job, and, again, very irresponsible. BARTIROMO: Bernie Sanders would also like to defund the Pentagon. The Democrats want to cut defense spending as well. And, real quick, give us your sense of what is happening in other cities across the country. Shootings are up 50 percent in New York. Crime, murder, and shootings are up in Chicago. What is happening in other cities, and how are you dealing with that? Tell us about Operation LeGend. WOLF: Absolutely. So, Operation LeGend is a Department of Justice-led operation into a number of cities. It has been on going in Kansas City. It is also taking place in Chicago, Albuquerque and a few others. And, again, what we're doing is, we're surging law enforcement assets into those cities to work on federal crimes that are being committed, whether it is gang violence or drug-related violence. And these are task forces that are occurring every day. And, again, federal officers are doing that in conjunction with state and local law enforcement officers. So, what we're doing is, we're surging resources, the Department of Homeland Security, using our Homeland Security investigation agents, are supporting that effort, again, trying to address some of the violent criminal activity that is occurring out in these cities that has gotten completely out of control. But I want to emphasize, we're doing that with state and local partnership, as we have done for the past several decades. Nothing is going to change there. We are going to continue to have that partnership with them. But what we are trying to do is, we're trying to put additional assets into those cities, so that we can investigate more, we can wrap up those investigations quicker, and we can make more arrests. BARTIROMO: And is there a coincidence that many of these cities are being run by Democrat officials? I just want to talk quickly about policy and whether or not the Democrat policies are encouraging this. Nancy Pelosi the other day called your agents Storm Troopers. You have got -- just like you said a moment ago, you have got officials saying these are peaceful things, and they're not peaceful. What do you say about all of these cities, which we are going to show on camera now, being run by Democrats? WOLF: Well, I'd say the comment from Speaker Pelosi that our federal law enforcement officers, civil law enforcement officers are Storm Troopers, are the Gestapo, or are thugs is absolutely irresponsible. It's dangerous. And she should immediately apologize for that. What we again see across these cities is violent crime occurring. We will continue to surge resources, not only in Portland, but in other cities across the country. But I do want to make a different -- a distinction, which we talked about at the top of this segment. What is going on in Portland is very different than any other -- any other city across the country. And that relationship with the federal law enforcement officers and those state and local law enforcement officers is very different in Portland as it is anywhere else. So, I want to make sure that everyone is clear about that, and there's no confusion. BARTIROMO: Understood. Thank you so much, Secretary. Great to have you this morning. We so appreciate it, acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf. We will be right back with Devin Nunes live. He's got breaking news on the Russian collusion hoax, the coup that failed. You will never believe which prestigious Washington think tank he says has links to developing the dossier -- next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) \u00a0BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Congressman Devin Nunes was among the first lawmakers to question the Russian collusion hoax, as then chairman of the House Intel Committee, telling us right here on this program three years ago that the FBI engaged in a coup to take down a sitting president. This week, he joined me on \"Mornings With Maria\" over on FOX Business with some breaking news on the Steele dossier. Watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. DEVIN NUNES (R-CA): Where we now see direct links between the Brookings Institute leadership and the creation of -- possibly of the Steele dossier and the dissemination of the Steele dossier. I think they have real answer -- questions that need to be answered here about, what on earth was the president of Brookings doing texting back and forth to Steele? Why was he accepting the dossier? (END VIDEO CLIP) BARTIROMO: Joining me right now with an update is Congressman Devin Nunes. He's the ranking member the House Intel Committee. Congressman, it is always a pleasure to see you. Thank you for being here. NUNES: Thank you. BARTIROMO: We have this breaking news this morning, as the subsource of the dossier, Igor Danchenko, has been unmasked. Tell me about this subsource and its tie -- his ties to Brookings. NUNES: Well, thank you, Maria. Thanks for having me on. You may remember, a couple months ago, I was on your show, and I talked about that we were really looking at three Russians. And as Senator Graham said at the beginning of the show, it ends up that we actually weren't looking for -- the third one was actually not a Russian at all. He actually -- it sounds like he lives here in America. And the FBI led Congress to believe that -- and the media led Congress to believe and they led the American public to believe that somehow Steele had this really super secret source that nobody could know about. Well, it ends up that he used to work for the Brookings Institute. It looks like there was a lot of connections to the Brookings Institute, which, for those of your viewers who don't know what this is, this is like the prominent left-wing think tank here in our nation's capital. So, we're investigating now, and have been. And we had these links earlier on. People may remember. The president of Brookings, back in 2016, we know that he had given the dossier to a few people. We had that through testimony. You also may remember that the State Department was involved and there were additional dossiers that weren't the Steele dossiers, except that they mirrored the Steele dossiers. And we think there is a connection between the president of Brookings and those dossiers that were given to the State Department that mirrored the Steele dossiers, which, look, all of this, what does this mean? These -- this was the Clinton campaign's dossiers. It was the dirt. It was a phony story that they sold, not only to the American people, but they sold it and corrupted our FBI, where it appears like these dirty cops were more than willing to take this information and present it to the FISA court. So, here is the final point on Brookings. BARTIROMO: Are you -- yes. NUNES: So, here's the final point. So, we have now expanded our investigation, full-blown investigation, into the Brookings Institute. And it really centers on two issues. One is the IRS. This is a tax-exempt organization. They're supposed to stay out of politics. They clearly have not done that. They have obstructed our investigation with propaganda for the last four years. It's well-known that they have attacked our investigation for four years through this kind of phony legal group of fact-checkers that they set up. BARTIROMO: Right. NUNES: So, we need to look at their -- see if they have been involved in politics. BARTIROMO: OK. NUNES: Secondly, they take... BARTIROMO: So, the -- yes. NUNES: Yes. Secondly, they take -- they also take foreign money from foreign countries and foreign governments. And we need to know what foreign governments were involved in this, because were they acting on behalf of a foreign power? Everybody questioned for all this time, you know, the Trump campaign and Republicans were involved with Russians. Well, who was the Brookings Institute -- who were their foreign donors? And are they doing all of this not just to help the Democratic Party, but also any foreign government? BARTIROMO: Well, what tells me -- what this all tells me, including the subsource revealed, is that there was indeed collusion in this country, but it was collusion with Hillary Clinton and the Democrats. Is that a fair statement? (LAUGHTER) NUNES: Well, yes. And it also just goes to show you that this was some sick fantasy that was made up by the Clinton campaign and their operatives. And think of this. You had people in the media -- remember this whole thing about prostitutes and Pee tapes in Moscow? These fools were running around all over Europe and Moscow, the leading institutions, these supposedly leading reporters, but nobody calls them out on that. And the whole thing was like some sick fantasy made up by the Clinton campaign. BARTIROMO: Well, many of them actually got Pulitzer Prizes for their reporting. NUNES: That's right. BARTIROMO: I want to ask you about Robert Mueller, because these items that were declassified clearly indicate that the FBI knew that the dossier was fake, that the dossier was hearsay and bar talk. How come Mueller didn't unearth these things? I mean, let's watch Robert Mueller when he testified in front of Congress to listen to what he said about things like Fusion GPS. Roll the clip. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: When you talk about the firm that produced the Steele reporting, the name of the firm that produced that was Fusion GPS. Is that correct? ROBERT MUELLER, RUSSIA PROBE SPECIAL COUNSEL: I'm not familiar with that. (CROSSTALK) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Well, let me just help you. It was. It's not a trick question or anything. It was Fusion GPS. (END VIDEO CLIP) BARTIROMO: \"I'm not familiar with it.\" NUNES: Yes. BARTIROMO: You have unearthed all of these things, Lindsey Graham declassifying the evidence that the FBI knew the dossier was garbage, and he had no recollection? I don't understand. Where was Mueller in all of this, Congressman? NUNES: Well, look, I think the question is, is, does Mueller know where Mueller is, OK? This was somebody who has put up as an avatar to give credibility to this investigation that was phony from the beginning, OK? So I'm not talking about just in 2016. I'm talking about the day that Mueller walks in the door. I'm not sure he knows what the hell's going on. And, clearly, a couple years later, when he testifies before Congress, to not know who Fusion GPS is was astounding. And, look, the Democratic Party -- it's very odd. For a party that seems to be against white people and always talking about racism, they sure like to, like, prop up these avatar old white dudes, where -- they have one running for president right now who's hiding in his basement, who won't answer questions. What was his involvement? Their presidential candidate supposedly went after him, was the one who concocted this idea to use the Logan Act to investigate the Trump campaign, and the incoming president, by the way. BARTIROMO: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Well, you have made 14 criminal referrals, with a 15th pending. We are waiting on John Durham to investigate that. We're going to hear more from John Durham, I assume. Let me move on, real quick, about the technology CEOs testifying, not in front of your committee, but they're going to be testifying this week in the House in front of the Judiciary Committee. You have said conservative censorship is the most important issue ahead of the 2020 election. What do you want to hear from people like the head of Twitter, the head of Google, et cetera, when they testify this week? NUNES: Well, look, Congress gave these guys special powers, so that they could create companies, so that people could go and use the Internet. It was supposed to be an open public square. Think of it as a public square, where everyone, as long as they're not -- as long as they're following the law, they can go out there and state their case, and participate in that public square. What's happened here is, is that Facebook and Google and Twitter are partisan hacks for the Democratic Party and the left. And so what's happening is, think of that -- go back to that public square example. They're deciding who gets to go into the public square. So, the good thing will be is that we're actually going to have the Parler CEO who's going to testify. And you can follow me at Parler @DevinNunes at Parler. BARTIROMO: Yes. NUNES: And he's been on your show, Maria. They have actually -- they're actually... BARTIROMO: Yes. NUNES: They have that town square. And they're letting all Americans go there and express their views. BARTIROMO: OK. We got to jump. Congressman, it's good to see you. Thank you so much, Devin Nunes. NUNES: My pleasure. BARTIROMO: We will be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) \u00a0BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo this week taking a hard line once again on Beijing, accusing the Chinese Communist Party of tyrannizing its people, while speaking at a Richard Nixon Library event in California on Thursday, Pompeo's rebuke coming just hours after two Chinese diplomats were caught trying to steal coronavirus vaccine research in Houston. Joining me right now is Ray Dalio. He's the co-chief investment officer and the co-investment officer of Bridgewater Associates and founder. It is great to see you once again, Ray. Thanks very much for joining me once again this week. RAY DALIO, CO-CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER/CO-CHAIRMAN, BRIDGEWATER ASSOCIATES: \u00a0Great to be here.\u00a0 \u00a0BARTIROMO: So, I want to talk about the economy and your thoughts on the dollar and all of the stimulus that we have seen in the Federal Reserve, Ray. But, first, I have got to get your reaction to all that we're seeing coming out of China. I know that you are a global investor. And you look for growth across the world. Would you still want to invest in China, given what we have learned about the Communist Party? DALIO: I think there are three things, three big things going on, and they operate together. And those are the important ones. The first is where we are in the debt cycle, the printing of money, and that. The second is how we are with each other, that we're having an ideological civil war that, when you combine that with an economic downturn, in which there is the printing of money and the creation of money out of thin air, is an issue. And then you have the rising power of China challenging the existing power. Those three things, the last time they happened was in the 1930-to-'45 period. I think you have to see them together. So, that is the position we're now in. In terms of China, we will -- we are in a conflict with China. You can call it a war, like the 1930s, so that there is a -- there is a trade war, there is a technology war, there is a geopolitical war, and there could be a capital war. And so that's the reality. Now regarding policy, that's for governments to set. But the challenge is to set it well, because, if you say, by law, don't invest in China, or even possibly withholding the payment of bonds that the United States owes payment on in China, these things are possibilities, and they have big implications, such as for the value of the dollar, because investors, free market investors, are not used to having those things dictated by the government. So, these are difficult questions that have to be well-addressed at this time. BARTIROMO: But would the -- would the news of one million Uyghurs being locked up in reeducation camps, the ignoring of the rule of law by stealing intellectual property, the overreach in Hong Kong, breaking promises there, militarizing the South China Sea, do any of these things come into focus when deciding to invest in China? DALIO: I think that we, as Americans, have got to decide on what's most important to us. And it becomes a challenge. For example, from the Chinese perspective, they believe that is an area of sovereignty and that those internal issues are be to dealt with by them, and we have to have -- just like they wouldn't deal in our internal issues. These are questions that individuals don't decide. Individuals have to decide... BARTIROMO: OK. DALIO: ... if they're ethical, if they're operating in ways that are consistent with their beliefs. That is a personal decision that you want to do. BARTIROMO: That is exactly right. DALIO: But the only -- but, at the end of the day... BARTIROMO: That's what I'm saying, yes. DALIO: At the end of the day, it will... BARTIROMO: Hold on, Ray. We're going to take -- we're going to -- yes. DALIO: At the end of the day... (CROSSTALK) BARTIROMO: We're going to take a break and then come back to that when we come right back. Stay with us, Ray Dalio. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BARTIROMO: We are back with Bridgewater chief investment officer Ray Dalio. And, Ray, a moment ago, you mentioned the potential for a capital war. I want to ask you about the economy and what your thoughts are about all of the stimulus being thrown at the economy, given this shutdown. Do you worry about the impact to the reserve currency, the dollar, Ray? DALIO: Yes, I -- we are only going to be successful if we do things in a solid way, right? So, the things I worry about the most are the soundness of our money. You can't continue to run deficits, sell debt, or print money, rather than be productive and sustain that over a period of time. And that relates to the money and what's now happening. And the second is the working together. I study history. And, as I say, the '30-to-'45 period is educational, because, within each country, there have been conflicts about -- like our conflicts. Four democracies chose to be dictatorships because of the disorder of how people are fighting with each other, rather than working together. If we don't work together to do the sound things, to be productive, to earn more than we spend, to build our currency, the stability of our currency, and build a good balance sheet, we are going to decline. We are declining because of those things. And so it's basically in those fundamentals that are the most important things that we deal with. We are our own worst enemy. BARTIROMO: Yes. DALIO: So, how we deal with each other soundly and productively, in a way... BARTIROMO: Yes. DALIO: ... that most people in the country believe is fair, is going to determine our future. BARTIROMO: Ray -- Ray, thank you.

All of them are subject to torture, medical neglect and forced labor at the hands of the brutal Chinese dictatorship.In addition, there is disturbing evidence of forced sterilizations\u00a0and other coercive measures used to curtail family size and population growth among ethnic Uighurs.In these camps, the Uighurs \u2014 who are of Turkic ethnicity, predominately Muslim and speak their own language \u2014 undergo what the communists euphemistically dub \u201creeducation.\u201d Chinese Communist Party officials indoctrinate them in the teachings of communism and the tenants of the Chinese revolution.The Uighurs are also forced to learn Mandarin Chinese, renounce their religion, and pledge absolute loyalty to the Chinese communist regime. At the same time they are forced to work for little or no pay \u2014 many times making low-cost products exported to the U.S. that line American store shelves.These coercive policies are part of the Chinese government\u2019s series of authoritarian campaigns \u2014 such as the power grab in Hong Kong \u2014 \u00a0as Chinese leaders crack down on what they perceive as threats to the strength and stability of the communist regime.The Uighurs\u2019 unique identity, separate from the population in the rest of mainland China, runs counter to President Xi\u2019s doctrine of\u00a0Sinicization \u2014 \u00a0the deliberate guidance of the Chinese people towards a unified race and culture modeled after the Han Chinese.Despite calls by the United States, our allies and several instrumental international organizations to immediately cease this genocide against the Uighurs, China claims that that its mass internment camps \u2014 which it calls \u201cvocational training centers\u201d\u2014 don\u2019t infringe on the basic human rights of the Uighurs.However, the Chinese have blocked foreign journalists and international inspectors from surveying the camps. Let\u2019s make one thing clear \u2014 these are concentration camps.But the world is finally waking up to China\u2019s extraordinarily evil practices and taking action against its government. Last month, President Trump signed into law legislation born out of the final recommendations made by the Congressional-Executive Commission on China.The Uighur Human Rights and Policy Act of 2020 applies sanctions to senior Chinese officials who are directly responsible for the ongoing repression of the Uighur population.Invoking the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act, the White House has taken swift action against several key Chinese Politburo officials, including the Communist Party secretary and former deputy party secretary of the Xinjiang Autonomous Region.The U.S. Treasury Department issued the sanctions after exposing connections between these key individuals and serious, inhumane crimes against ethnic minorities in China, including the Uighurs.I applaud Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and President Trump for these proactive steps.I refuse to be deterred or be threatened by the latest sanctions against the Congressional-Executive Commission on China. We will continue to push our international partners to hold China accountable. We will continue to do our part to ensure that the communists in China are exposed for their reprehensible policies of ethnic genocide, and to expose U.S. companies complicit in this debasement.History will be our judge and should be our teacher.", "comment": "(120)", "topic": "OPINION", "date": " July 17"}, {"cover": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/07/156/88/AP20193665252403.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "title": "China moves rocket into place for upcoming Mars mission", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/science/china-moves-rocket-upcoming-mars-mission", "subtitle": "China has moved a rocket into position to launch a rover to Mars in one of three upcoming missions to the red planet, one from the U.S. and another by the United Arab Emirates.", "keyword": "China and national Security", "website": "Fox News", "author": "", "content": "BEIJING (AP) \u2014  has moved a rocket into position to launch a rover to  in one of three upcoming missions to the red planet, one from the U.S. and another by the United Arab Emirates.The Long March-5 carrier rocket is China\u2019s heaviest-lift launch vehicle and has been used experimentally three times, but never with a payload.

Such a window opens only once every 26 months.Preparations have continued amid the coronavirus outbreak, which in part prompted Europe and Russia to drop their plans to send a life-seeking rover to Mars this summer.Each spacecraft will travel more than 480 million kilometers (300 million miles) before reaching Mars next February.

Six other spacecraft are exploring the planet from orbit: three U.S., two European and one from India.China\u2019s last attempt at a Mars mission in collaboration with Russia ended in failure in 2011.

Thank you. Thank you, Dana. Good evening. Welcome to Washington, I'm Bret Baier. Breaking tonight, how to get students back to school safely amid the coronavirus pandemic? The president and first lady participating in what was billed as a national dialogue on the subject earlier today. Vice President Mike Pence was also there. I will speak exclusively with the president's point man on the coronavirus in just a few minutes. We have Fox team coverage, Jonathan Serrie in Atlanta as operation warp speed is getting a big cash infusion in the search for a vaccine, but we begin with correspondent Kristin Fisher at the White House and the effort to get kids back to school on time and out of danger. Good evening, Kristin. KRISTIN FISHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Good evening, Bret. Today we saw an administration-wide push to get schools reopened this fall. They say for the good of students, parents, and the entire U.S. economy. President Trump has been very clear where he stands on this issue but today he took a nap -- took it up a notch and explicitly said that he is going to be pressuring governors across the country to get on board. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: They think it's going to be good for them politically, so they keep the schools close, no way. So we're very much going to put pressure on governors and everybody else to open the schools. FISHER: President Trump is urging governors across the country to follow the lead of Florida Governor Ron DeSantis whose administration has just ordered that all schools reopen in August. During a day-long panel discussion, administration officials from Doctor Deborah Birx to Education Secretary Betsy DeVos made the case that the risk of reopening outweighs the benefits of keeping children home. DR. DEBORAH BIRX, CORONAVIRUS RESPONSE COORDINATOR, WHITE HOUSE: In the rush to just close things down, there was not -- everything was not completely considered in that moment about how we were going to protect our children. BETSY DEVOS, UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF EDUCATION: We can't overstate the importance of the need for schools to be open again and for students to have that opportunity to learn together in person. FISHER: To help make their case, the administration is pointing to the American Academy of Pediatrics which strongly advocates that all policy considerations for the coming school year should start with a goal of having students physically present in school. And in New York City, the vast majority of parents pulled in a survey agreed. BILL DE BLASIO (D), MAYOR OF NEW YORK: 400,000 families responded, I've never heard anything like that and 75 percent of them want their kids back in school in September. FISHER: But other parents are concerned about their children catching the coronavirus in school and spreading it to loved ones in the at-risk age group and some teachers are worried, too. On the opposite end of the spectrum from what Florida is doing, Harvard University just announced that all classes will be online for the entire school year until the spring of 2021 and there are several hybrid options in between. So there is a huge range for educators and parents to consider as they brace for a possible second wave in the fall. DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH: We are still knee-deep in the first wave of this and I would say this would not be considered a wave, it was a surge or a resurgence of infections. (END VIDEOTAPE) FISHER: And today, the World Health Organization announced that they believe that the coronavirus pandemic is accelerating. The same day that President Trump officially pulled out of the organization. Joe Biden though, he is now promising to rejoin the WHO on day one in the White House if, of course, he wins, Bret. BAIER: Kristin Fisher live on the North Lawn. Kristin, thank you. The government is pouring another $1.6 billion to try to develop a vaccine for the coronavirus. Also tonight, more than four dozen hospitals in Florida are reporting that their intensive care units have now reached capacity. Correspondent Jonathan Serrie reports tonight from Atlanta. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JONATHAN SERRIE, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT: As new coronavirus cases surge across the south and west, nearly one in every 100 Floridians has now been infected. Starting Wednesday, Miami-Dade County will suspend short-term vacation rentals and indoor dining at restaurants. JOHNNY CARDONA, MENSWEAR STORE MANAGER: We might be getting lockdown for another three month. What's going to happen to this business owner? We don't know. SERRIE: After meeting with health advisors, the mayor tweeted, we arrived at a compromise to keep gyms and fitness studios open. All doing activities inside must wear a mask or do strenuous training outside staying 10 feet apart without mask. In hard-hit Texas, organizers of the state fair which drew more than 2-1/2 million visitors last year, announced they're canceling the event for the first time since World War II. In New York, state health officials issued a report suggesting Governor Andrew Cuomo's controversial and now discontinued policy requiring nursing homes to accept COVID-19 patients discharged from hospitals was not a significant factor in spreading the virus. Instead, the primary sources were infected visitors and staffers, many with no symptoms. DR. HOWARD ZUCKER, NEW YORK STATE HEALTH COMMISSIONER: The employee infections were related to the larger community spread and employee transmission has the strongest correlation to a nursing home fatalities. Admission policies were not a significant factor in nursing home fatalities. SERRIE: The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and Department of Defense announced a $1.6 billion agreement with pharmaceutical company Novavax to speed research and development of a potential COVID-19 vaccine under operation warp speed. STANLEY ERCK, CEO, NOVAVAX: This whole issue is unprecedented, the speed, the scale that we have to get to, that's going to require a lot of more work and luck and success, but we're confident in our platform. (END VIDEOTAPE) SERRIE: And Bret today, the University of Washington's Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation expanded its forecast for COVID-19. It is now projecting more than 208,000 U.S. deaths by October 1st, that's up from its previous projection of 175,000, Bret. BAIER: We've seen some back and forth with that organization before, we will track that. Jonathan, as always, thank you. Breaking tonight, if you or more likely your children, enjoy using the TikTok app, you should be aware the U.S. government may ban it soon. There are increasing concerns over the social media outlet and its ties to the Chinese government and what's coming out of it. State department correspondent Rich Edson shows us. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) RICH EDSON, FOX NEWS CHANNEL STATE DEPARTMENT CORRESPONDENT: This is TikTok, a popular app where users can record, edit, and interact with short videos. 30 million Americans use it but the Trump administration is considering banning the Chinese-owned company in the United States over security concerns. MIKE POMPEO, SECRETARY OF STATE: We're taking this very seriously, we're certainly looking at it. EDSON: U.S. officials tell Fox News discussions around possibly banning TikTok are in the early stages. Saying the administration is prepared to counter any app that spies on Americans. Chinese tech firm ByteDance which owns TikTok is denying the claims. The company says it stores American user's data in servers within the United States with a backup in Singapore that none of that information is subject to Chinese law and quote, TikTok is led by an American CEO. We have never provided user data to the Chinese government, nor would we do so if asked. U.S. Officials say TikTok is among other Chinese-owned apps they're evaluating. For years, the administration has led an international campaign to convince countries to curtail or ban Chinese software and equipment, claiming they expose sensitive data to Chinese government. (END VIDEOTAPE) EDSON: FBI Director Christopher Wray says of the FBI's nearly 5,000 counterintelligence cases, nearly half are related to China and China is actively working to compromise American institutions and companies that are researching COVID-19, Bret. BAIER: Rich Edson at the state department. Rich, thank you. Let's talk about where things stand right now in the fight against the coronavirus and the challenges with China as well. \u00a0We're joined by the man in charge of the Coronavirus Task Force, Vice President Mike Pence. \u00a0Mr. Vice President, thanks for being here. \u00a0MIKE PENCE, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Thank you, Bret. \u00a0BAIER: Why is it so important to open up schools this fall? \u00a0PENCE: Well, we had a very important summit today, a good conference call with the nation's governor. \u00a0And President Trump has made it clear, as we open up America again, we need to open up America's schools. And from early on in this pandemic, the CDC has been giving guidance on how we can safely mitigate and operate schools. \u00a0New guidance was issued last week. But I must tell you that parents around America, teachers around America -- and we trust leaders all across this country -- are going to continue to work, continue to find ways to open our schools up again. \u00a0The good news is, 47 states have already issued plans and guidance for doing just that. And we are going to continue to work very closely with them. \u00a0We just think it is important to get America back to work, it is important to get our kids back to school, and all of that can be done as we continue to make sure that states that are seeing rising cases have the testing, the personal protective equipment, and have the medicines to be able to confront this pandemic, even as we open up America again. \u00a0BAIER: The president said today, Mr. Vice President, that he was going to pressure the governors to open, if they didn't. \u00a0I just want to ask you what that looks like. If the governors, as what happened with the lockdown, make their own individual decisions, based on what their state is doing or going through and what health experts are telling them, what does that pressure look like? How does it manifest? \u00a0PENCE: Well, I think, today, the president brought together teachers, healthcare leaders. We all reflected on what I believe is the overwhelming opinion of the American people, that we have got to get our kids back to school. \u00a0And so today was very much about the president doing like he is wont to do, is focusing on this important need. \u00a0But I must tell you, whether it be the American Association of Pediatrics that put out a statement last week about the importance of classroom learning, the -- what we are hearing from educators and parents around America, that we can't let our kids fall behind academically. \u00a0But, also, Bret, you know, you are a parent. You understand that it's far beyond academics, that millions of families rely on our local schools. \u00a0Many -- many of our children that struggle with emotional challenges or disabilities, they receive those services at school. Add into that nutrition. Add into that other ways that we serve our kids. \u00a0It's absolutely essential that we get back to school. And the president is going to continue to focus effort on that, but also work with our governors to see those plans implemented. \u00a0The one point that we made today with governors on our conference call, Bret, was, as the CDC has issued renewed guidance last week on how we can safely operate our schools, we wanted to make it clear, we don't want the federal government to be the reason why you don't reopen your local school. \u00a0BAIER: Yes. \u00a0PENCE: We want to work with local officials, school officials, governors in states around the country to find a way to safely reopen our schools. \u00a0BAIER: I think... \u00a0PENCE: And we believe that we can do that for most of the country. \u00a0BAIER: Mr. Vice President, I think there is unity that parents want their kids back to school. \u00a0PENCE: Yes. \u00a0BAIER: I do think that you hear that, no matter the ideology, the political ideology. \u00a0But do you believe, as the president said today, that Democrats want to keep schools closed for political reasons? You talk to these governors, Democrats and Republicans. \u00a0PENCE: Well, look, I -- let me leave the governors out of it for just a second to say they're -- when we hear some word about teachers unions beginning already to say that they're not going to be willing to come back in some jurisdictions around the country, look, we all ought to be working together on this. \u00a0I mean, as I said at the top, to open up America, we have got to open up America's schools. It's absolutely essential. \u00a0I didn't even mention the fact that the academic well-being, the health and well-being of our kids is of paramount importance. But let's remember working families. Let's remember single parents. \u00a0I mean, for people to be able to go back to work full-time this fall, we have got to have these schools up and running and working. \u00a0BAIER: Yes, I hear you. \u00a0PENCE: And so, what -- the president made it clear today, shot across the bow, anybody that wants to play politics on this thing is on fair notice that we're not going to put up with it. \u00a0And I really believe that the overwhelming majority of the American people, of families, of educators all know we can get back to school, we can get back to school safely, K-12, higher education. \u00a0And our White House Coronavirus Task Force is going to continue to work very closely with Republican and Democrat governors to get that done. \u00a0BAIER: Well, let's hope it happens. \u00a0Today, the administration just pulled out of the World Health Organization. \u00a0Not surprisingly, Joe Biden put out a tweet, saying he would join it, if he gets elected, on the first day. \u00a0But your fellow Republican Lamar Alexander, chairman of the Senate Health Committee, put out this statement moments ago, saying, \"I disagree with the president's decision. Certainly there needs to be a good, hard look at mistakes the World Health Organization might have made in connection with the coronavirus, but the time to do that is after the crisis has been dealt with, not in the middle of it. Withdrawing U.S. membership could, among other things, interfere with clinical trials that are essential to the development of vaccines, which citizens of the United States as well as others in the world need.' \u00a0Is now the right time to be doing this move? \u00a0PENCE: Well, it's absolutely the right time to notify Congress. \u00a0With all due respect to Senator Alexander's view, the World Health Organization let the world down, and by -- by not informing the United States and the wider world of this pandemic as it began in China, as giving ill-fated advice in January and February. It -- there have to be consequences to this. \u00a0But, look, I will be honest with you. I'm not surprised Joe Biden wants to -- wants to keep us roped into another international organization. I mean, Joe Biden actually condemned President Trump's actions when he suspended all travel from China at the end of January. \u00a0You know, the fact that the president did that, I can tell you firsthand, Bret, that bought our nation invaluable time to reinvent testing, to spin up hundreds of millions of personal protective equipment and supplies, to begin the process of pursuing medicines, therapeutics, and vaccines. \u00a0If -- if Joe Biden would've had his way, we literally would've had tens of millions of more Chinese coming into our country and spreading the pandemic and putting more and more Americans at risk. \u00a0BAIER: I want to talk to you (ph) -- \u00a0PENCE: So, right decision on the WHO. Joe Biden would've made the wrong decision in January. \u00a0BAIER: Apologize for the delay. \u00a0I want to talk to you about China in just a minute. \u00a0But just to wrap up the coronavirus -- \u00a0PENCE: Yes. \u00a0BAIER: And you lead this task force. Obviously, the numbers are going up. The president wants us to focus on death rate. And we do. And I will mention that in a minute. \u00a0The administration critics say the president constantly downplays the seriousness of COVID-19. And they say he speaks in optimism, not reality. \u00a0Take a listen to this. \u00a0(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) \u00a0TRUMP: We have tested almost 40 million people. By so doing, we show cases, 99 percent of which are totally harmless. \u00a0THOMAS BOSSERT, FORMER WHITE HOUSE HOMELAND SECURITY ADVISER: We have to start at the basics and level with people. Suggesting that it's not dangerous is, in itself, a dangerous message. \u00a0(END VIDEO CLIP) \u00a0BAIER: Mr. Vice President, Tom Bossert obviously served in the administration with you. \u00a0Health experts say it's just not the case that only 1 percent of cases, COVID cases, that they're dangerous. It's more than that. \u00a0So, is there a messaging problem here with the virus? \u00a0PENCE: Well, look, the American people know President Trump is an optimist. He believes in this country. \u00a0But he also believes the American people deserve to have the whole story. I mean, the reality is, because of what the president did in suspending all travel to China, we were able to stand up a national response that has saved hundreds of thousands, and perhaps even millions, of American lives. \u00a0We have rising cases right now along the South, Bret. I was in Texas and Arizona and Florida last week. And the good news is, is, as we told governors again today, we have the resources to support all the testing that they need. \u00a0We have new therapeutic medicines that -- like remdesivir, that have been distributed all across the country. And we have literally tens of millions of personal protective equipment supplies in reserves, even though I heard from the governors that I personally met with that the PPE effort by the national government has been so strong that the hospitals all across the Sunbelt that are seeing rising cases have more than enough PPE. \u00a0What they did request of us, and the president authorized, was us to send additional doctors and nurses. We are in the process of doing that in all four of the larger states that have been impacted so far. And we will do it in any other states that request it. \u00a0BAIER: Right. On the -- \u00a0PENCE: But what the president wants the American people to know is that our national response, whether it be testing, whether it be PPE, whether it be the supplies and the medicines, has saved American lives. \u00a0More than two months ago, Bret, we were losing 2,500 Americans a day, and there was a day just recently where we only lost 250 Americans. \u00a0BAIER: Right. \u00a0PENCE: That's a 90 percent reduction in fatalities. \u00a0BAIER: So -- \u00a0PENCE: It's a credit to the American people, to all the sacrifices they have made, to our healthcare workers. \u00a0But, ultimately, it's a credit to our national response, which has secured one of the lowest mortality rates in the world. \u00a0BAIER: Right. \u00a0Now, you talk about mortality. Dr. Fauci said today that it's a false narrative to take comfort in the lower rate of death, because there are so many things very dangerous about this disease. Don't get yourself into false complacency. \u00a0You are right about the mortality rates. But some experts are saying they drag behind, with the cases going up, that the death rates -- well, let's hope not, but they may follow. \u00a0Here -- Dr. Fauci also said that state and local governments should mandate mask-wearing, especially if there is an outbreak there. Do you agree with that recommendation? \u00a0PENCE: Well, we -- what we agree with is whatever state and local officials determine is appropriate for their area. \u00a0I mean, from the very beginning, President Trump has made it clear that we are going to support our governors, we are going to support local health officials in taking the steps that they deem are most appropriate. \u00a0But back to Dr. Fauci, who I have worked with very closely now for four months, you know, the -- I can assure you, there is no complacency in the administration. \u00a0And the president isn't referring to the lowest mortality rate in the world as a reason for complacency. He just -- he wants the American people to know that we have made progress combating this pandemic because of all the sacrifices they have made. \u00a0And we are going to continue to make sure that states across this country, particularly across the Sunbelt, have the resources and the supplies to do everything in their power, with those incredible healthcare workers in those hospitals, to keep those losses low, again, the lowest in the world by several measures. \u00a0It's a credit to the American people. And we are not going to relent in our effort to make sure that our states have the testing resources to identify people -- \u00a0BAIER: Yes. \u00a0PENCE: -- have the PPE to render healthcare, have the extraordinary medicines like remdesivir, like the steroid treatment, like convalescent plasma, that are really bringing real relief and restoring health to Americans. \u00a0It's -- \u00a0BAIER: Mr. Vice President -- \u00a0PENCE: We just -- we owe it to the American people to give them the whole story. \u00a0And while you see cases rising -- and, frankly, some in the media want to focus exclusively on rising cases -- the American people deserve to understand that we are making progress in this pandemic. It's because of all that they have done. \u00a0And we are going to make sure every state and every community that has rising cases and rising positivity rates has everything they need to meet the moment. \u00a0BAIER: Mr. Vice President, I wanted to give you time to talk about that. \u00a0There -- your shot just dropped out for a second. \u00a0If you wouldn't mind, I do want to ask you about China. \u00a0PENCE: Sure. \u00a0BAIER: Do you have a second on the other side of this break? \u00a0PENCE: You bet. \u00a0BAIER: OK. \u00a0We will be back with the vice president of the United States after this. \u00a0(COMMERCIAL BREAK) \u00a0BAIER: Again, joined by the vice president of the United States. \u00a0Mr. Vice President, thank you for sticking around. \u00a0PENCE: You bet. \u00a0BAIER: On China, Secretary of State Pompeo said you all are considering the banning of this Chinese-owned app TikTok. \u00a0The FBI director spoke out very aggressively with me, and then gave a speech this week about China. \u00a0You have spoken out a couple of times aggressively about China. \u00a0PENCE: Yes. \u00a0BAIER: Is China our enemy? \u00a0PENCE: Well, there's no question China is a strategic competitor with -- \u00a0BAIER: Lost the feed there from the vice president. \u00a0Let's see if we reestablish this connection. Don't think we have him up. \u00a0Mr. Vice President, can you hear me? \u00a0OK, we will try to reestablish that connection. Oh, here we go. \u00a0Sorry for the interruption, Mr. Vice President. \u00a0You were saying on China? \u00a0PENCE: Well, no one's been tougher on China than President Donald Trump, Bret. \u00a0I mean from very early on, this president stood strong to reset an imbalanced trading relationship that previous administrations allowed to develop in a way that, when we took office, half of our international trade deficit was with China. \u00a0The president stood strong. He also made it clear that we are going to defend our strategic interests in the region. Two aircraft carriers in the South China Sea as we speak is evidence of our commitment to continue to remain an Asian-Pacific power and preserve freedom of navigation. \u00a0But I must tell you that, whether it be the stand on Huawei, or what we're currently considering with TikTok, this president also made it clear that we are going to preserve the national security interests of the United States of America from being compromised by the Chinese Communist Party. \u00a0And so, these entities, whether it be Huawei and perhaps even TikTok, that represents a threat to the privacy and to the security of the country, we will continue to take a strong stand. \u00a0BAIER: I want to end with this, turning to topics that the president brought up this week. \u00a0Did NASCAR make the right move banning the confederate flag? \u00a0PENCE: Well, let me say that we respect the right of private organizations to make the decisions that they deem appropriate for their organization and for their fan base. \u00a0But, at the end of the day, the president -- as he said again today, he believes in freedom of speech -- will always stand for that for every American. \u00a0But I must tell you that being a part of an administration that saw the lowest unemployment rate ever recorded for African-Americans, that we heard again today at our education summit has made historic investments in Historically Black Colleges and Universities, working to open up those schools and all of our schools around America as we speak, expanding Opportunity Zones, I think people, whether it be African-Americans or any American, looks at the record of this administration, and knows that this is a president who is committed to being president for all of the American people and to seeing all of the American people live the American dream. \u00a0BAIER: Yes. \u00a0I guess the state of Mississippi removed the confederate symbol from its flag. And Republicans in that state said, like Roger Wicker, it was the right thing to do. It's a symbol that more and more represents a day in the past that we don't want to celebrate. \u00a0And some of those Republicans thought there was a disconnect, at least, in what was tweeted out by the president. You're saying there's not? \u00a0PENCE: Well, there's not. \u00a0And we fully respect the decision made by the people of Mississippi going forward. \u00a0And quite apart from the whole issue of the confederate flag, I just think it's the question of -- as the president said at Mount Rushmore, we are going to defend the great and long story (ph) history of this country. \u00a0We have been on a relentless journey toward a more perfect union. We went through a terrible Civil War; 600,000 Americans died on both sides to end slavery. We saw the advance in my lifetime of the civil rights movement, at great cost. \u00a0And we are going to continue to celebrate all of the ideals of this country, the contributions of every American, of every race and creed and background. \u00a0And this president, in a very real sense, I promise you, is going to continue to defend America and defend America's great traditions against those who want to tear down statues, who want to erase our history. \u00a0We believe that we can learn from our history, we can move forward together, and that's how we are going to have a more united United States of America. BAIER: Mr. Vice President, we really appreciate your time, your extra time, thank you for sticking around, and we'll see you down the road. PENCE: Thank you, Bret. BAIER: Up next, we'll have the other day's news. Stay here on SPECIAL REPORT. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BAIER: Breaking just before the show tonight, the top U.S. general in the Middle East says he was aware of intelligence about a Russian bounty program targeting American troops in Afghanistan, but CENTCOM commander General Kenneth McKenzie says that while he found it worrisome, he did not believe it was tied to actual death on the battlefield and saw nothing of that. We'll continue to follow that story. In tonight's Democracy 2020 report, even in these uncertain time, Joe Biden can count on at least one primary election vote tonight, his own. The presumptive Democratic nominee participated in the election in Delaware. It comes as we learn new details of how President Trump is trying to frame his challenger and whether that's working. Here is correspondent Peter Doocy. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PETER DOOCY, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: President Trump is trying to peg Joe Biden as a figurehead surrounded by radical leftists. DONALD TRUMP, (R) PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Sleepy Joe, and he wouldn't call the shots. He would have nothing to do with it. Lock him in the Oval Office, let's just do what we want to do. DOOCY: But in a new memo, the Biden campaign argues lines like that aren't landing. Quote, \"The reality, while Donald Trump is desperately trying to paint Biden is out of the mainstream, Trump's record of shoveling taxpayer money to big corporations, cutting taxes for the wealthy, and suing to take away protections for people with preexisting conditions couldn't be any further from the values of ordinary Americans.\" Now part of the team that helped Barack Obama get elected twice argues this president's approach could hurt all Republicans up in November. JIM MESSINA, OBAMA 2012 CAMPAIGN MANAGER: What President Trump needs to do is become president and pull the country together, and instead he's spending his whole time attacking everyone but himself, and it's doing real damage. DOOCY: President Trump's former chief of staff agrees. MICK MULVANEY, INCOMING ACTING WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF: I think he's got some real headwinds to face. DOOCY: But he has some ideas about how President Trump can turn things around. MULVANEY: The president can go back to drawing those contrasts between him and Joe Biden. If it becomes a race between Trump and Biden, I think the president does extraordinarily well. DOOCY: The DNC is now working closer with the Biden campaign than they ever did with the Clinton campaign, as Democrats cross their fingers their side doesn't get overconfident. MESSINA: We are the party that screwed up 2016 and lost to Donald Trump in the first place. (END VIDEOTAPE) DOOCY: Joe Biden just did his part to help Joe Biden to be Trump, and it has nothing to do with a speech or a policy paper. He voted by mail in his home state's primary. So he did as much as any Delaware resident can. Bret? BAIER: Peter, thank you. Be sure to check out my podcast \"The Campaign.\" It comes out every Tuesday, 5:00 p.m. Peter is on there. You can download it at = or wherever you download podcasts. It's a great panel discussion, update on the state of the race right now week to week. Stock were off today. The Dow lost 397, the S&P 500 fell 34, the Nasdaq finished down 90. Up next, President Trump's niece spills some of what she says are family secrets. We have the book and a report. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BAIER: We're getting our first look at some of the explosive claim in a new book by President Trump's niece. We have the book. Correspondent David Spunt has the details. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KAYLEIGH MCENANY, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: It's a book of falsehoods. DAVID SPUNT, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: That book is \"Too Much and Never Enough, How My Family Created the World's Most Dangerous Man,\" 200 pages that tell a story of dysfunction and the rise to power. Mary Trump spills alleged family secrets and private conversations. Without providing proof, she claims that more than 50 years ago, her uncle, who she calls \"Donald\" throughout the book, paid a friend to take his SAT test help him get accepted at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, writing \"That was much easier to pull off in the days before photo IDs and computerized records. Donald, who never lacks for funds, paid his buddy well.\" It's an accusation the White House denies. Mary Trump is the daughter of the president's late brother Fred. She recounts the stress from her father's death in 1981 following a battle with alcoholism. DONALD TRUMP, (R) PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Great guy, best looking guy, best personality, much better than mine. (LAUGHTER) TRUMP: But he had a problem. SPUNT: Mary Trump recalls an alleged conversation with her aunt, retired federal judge Maryanne Trump Barry, in 2015. According to Mary, her onset \"He's using your father's memory for political purposes,\" Maryanne said, \"and that's a sin, especially since Freddy should have been the star of the family.\" She claims the president's sister doubted his election prospects and called him a clown. DONALD TRUMP, (R) PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I, Donald John Trump, do solemnly swear. SPUNT: Mary has seldom been in touch with the president, admitting she was estranged from his immediate family for years, cut out of her grandmother's will and unwelcome at her funeral. The book comes just weeks after former National Security Advisor John Bolton released his tell-all of his time in the White House and two months before a book about the First Lady from former aide Stephanie Winston Wolkoff is set to hit shelves. KELLYANNE CONWAY, COUNSELOR TO PRESIDENT TRUMP: We imbue instant credibility onto anybody, especially those not under oath and writing works of fiction, perhaps, or a fiction within a work of fiction, as long as they are out there to get the president. (END VIDEOTAPE) SPUNT: This is the book, Bret. President Trump's younger brother Robert fought in court to block the book's release, arguing that Mary signed a confidentiality agreement. After bouncing back and forth to several judges, the book is scheduled for release one week from today. No comment tonight from the president's sister, Judge Trump Barry, about the book. Bret? BAIER: OK, David, thank you. There are a lot of questions tonight concerning what we know and what we don't know about the coronavirus. Correspondent Doug McKelway looks at some of them this evening. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DOUG MCKELWAY, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Two months after his first appearance on Florida beaches, the ominously dressed lawyer Daniel Uhlfelder came back to the beach as the Grim Reaper, as if to prove his earlier warnings about COVID-19 research. But 120 days in, there's still much unknown. The president tweeted yesterday \"Cases up because of massive testing, deaths are down, low and steady.\" The tweet is largely true. DR. MARC SIEGEL, NYU LANGONE MEDICAL CENTER: Case numbers have doubled over the past few weeks, but I'm seeing a decreasing in trends yesterday, 47 deaths. Deaths are extremely low. MCKELWAY: Nationwide, positive cases are at 44,953 in the last week, but deaths are up only 325. That's a distinction not made in some reporting, and many experts still maintain some states reopened too soon. DR. TOM FRIEDEN, FORMER CDC DIRECTOR: If you open when cases are still increasing, as many states did, it's like leaning into a left hook. You're going to get hit hard, and that's what's happening. MCKELWAY: The south and west is where heat and ultraviolet sunlight were expected to slow the spread. One suggestion is that stifling summer heat is driving people to the air-conditioned indoors, where the virus may thrive. The Cleveland Clinic notes that air-conditioning moves air around in a room, but sys there's is no clear evidence it spreads the virus. Another unknown -- is it possible to be re-infected with COVID-19? The CDC finds, quote, \"The immune response, including duration of immunity, is not yet understood.\" (END VIDEOTAPE) MCKELWAY: Another question -- do masks really help? Early on in the pandemic, Surgeon General Adams cautioned against using them, but now that the disease has determined to be transmissible, he says they can make all the difference. Bret? BAIER: Dr. Fauci and Dr. Birx do, too. Doug, thank you. Up next, the panel on the coronavirus, schools, testing, and my interview with Vice President Pence. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES: \u00a0We are still knee-deep in the first wave of this. The current state is really not good. DR. DEBORAH BIRX, WHITE HOUSE CORONAVIRUS RESPONSE COORDINATOR: In the rush to just close things down, there was not -- everything was not completely considered in that moment about how we were going to protect our children. DONALD TRUMP, (R) PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We want to get our schools open. We want to get them open quickly, beautifully in the fall. MIKE PENCE, U.S. VICE PRESIDENT: It's far beyond academics that millions of families rely on our local schools. Many of our children that struggle with emotional challenges or disabilities, they receive those services at school. (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: Opening up the schools a priority, Vice President Pence talking about it on the show earlier. Let's bring in our panel, Charles Hurt, opinion editor for \"The Washington Times,\" Mara Liasson, national political correspondent for National Public Radio, and Jonah Goldberg, editor in chief of \"The Dispatch.\" Mara, it's obviously a priority. The president is saying he's going to pressure governors if they don't do it. But as we saw in the lockdown, eventually governors make the call in those states and localities. MARA LIASSON, NATIONAL POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, NATIONAL PUBLIC RADIO: \u00a0Yes. And look, every parent wants their kids to go back to school. Speaking for myself, that's true. But the big question is will reopening the schools take the same path as reopening other parts of the economy, where after you did that in certain states you had spikes. Sometimes classrooms can be petri dishes, and even if kids are not affected by the virus as much, teachers can be. So it's really important to get it right, and I know schools all over the country including my own kids schools are struggling with how to do it, how many kids should go back in the classroom at once, what kind of distancing do you impose. So this is a tricky problem. BAIER: And Jonah, there is obviously a disparity across the country with the ability of do some kind of hybrid or distance-learning where they come in, and if there's an issue then they go onto the computer. Not everybody has the same connectivity. JONAH GOLDBERG, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: It's not even just a state by state or jurisdiction by jurisdiction, it's also a level of school by level of school thing. Little kids are going to have different requirements than high school kids. Some states in warmer climates could figure out ways to do classes outside. You can't really ask Minnesota students to do a lot of classes outside in the fall and winter. So there's so much variation here. And I think it's very smart of the administration to talk about how much they want the schools to open because everybody agrees with that, but the devil is in the details, and it's a very strange disconnect to say that masks should be a state by state local issue, but schools should uniformly open all across the country. I think that's a real logistical hurdle for them. BAIER: Right, the two mandates there. Charlie? CHARLES HURT, OPINION EDITOR, \"WASHINGTON TIMES\": I actually think that its' -- I agree with Jonah that it's very wise for the administration to be talking about the importance of opening up schools. But I'd say going into the election, we have a very clear difference between that candidates, between President Trump and Vice President Joe Biden. Voters will have a real opportunity to pick between the two strategies. And I have to say that I do think the notion that you are pressuring localities to make those decisions at a local level is probably a very wise one. But meanwhile, pressuring people to open up is also a very important step in all of that. But at the end of the day we will have a referendum on this. BAIER: Mara, I want to turn to China. You have the FBI director, the secretary of state, now the vice president very aggressively talking about it, seems like it is coming to a head with some more executive actions about China. The trade deal, is it up in the air or not? We didn't really get there. But it seems like it also is going with campaign to pin China on Joe Biden. LIASSON: Yes, this is really tricky because the president wants the trade deal, but he also wants to be as tough on China as possible, because the argument that he's been pushing is that Joe Biden was too soft on China. China is one of the biggest contrasts he's trying to make, and I think the Biden campaign is trying as hard as they can to not make it easy for the Trump campaign to do that, returning fire, saying John Bolton's book, other evidence that we have that President Trump has been too easy on China. And I think you're just going to see this unfold, whether it's TikTok, Huawei, all sorts of other front lines. But China and that U.S. are decoupling, and its big flash point in the campaign. BAIER: And it's a big flash point in the world, Jonah. GOLDBERG: No, it is. I think it's baked into the cake that we're going to be entering an era of hawkishness towards China. The only question is going to be whether it's going to be dumb hawkishness and smart hawkishness, because we definitely need to push back on China. China needs to get that message. We need allies in the region, and I fear that this campaign, we're not going to get a lot of smart hawkery, and we're going to get a lot of pandering from both campaigns. BAIER: Oh, come on, it's a campaign. (LAUGHTER) BAIER: We'll see. GOLDBERG: I know you're shocked. BAIER: Yes, shocked, shocked. Thank you all, panel. When we come back, the brighter side of things, some good news. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BAIER: Finally tonight, as promised, the brighter side, helping each other out. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) (MUSIC) (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: Twice a week at 6:00 p.m., Damaris Silva serenades sick patients and staff at a Chilean hospital with her violin. She walks the halls for several hours playing the mix of popular Latin songs, very welcome. From Chile to Alabama. When a customer at a restaurant in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, noticed an employee walking to work, the generous stranger decided to help out. The restaurant film to the employee being led to his new car as colleagues shared in the surprise from the anonymous donor. Now that is something you don't see every day. Thanks for inviting us into your home tonight. That's it for this SPECIAL REPORT, fair, balanced, and unafraid.

A Catholic filmmaker said\u00a0the new guidelines \"almost entirely ban\" faith-based content in a country that is already hostile to the freedom of religion.\"If we film the life of Jesus\u00a0avoiding the content banned by the guidelines, we will only be presenting Jesus as an ordinary person, and this is unacceptable to Christians,\" the\u00a0filmmaker identified only as Joseph told UCA News.Father Yo of\u00a0Shandong also questioned the guidelines.\"What is true history? Is it the one fabricated by the Chinese Communist Party? Would it not lead to creating more fake television dramas in line with the party to brainwash the public?\" he asked.The new guidelines could impact Hollywood productions as well.Earlier this month, Attorney General Bill Barr blasted Hollywood for appeasing China with self-censorship to ensure entry into its tightly-knit marketplace, saying studios have given the Chinese Communist Party \"a massive propaganda coup.\"\u201cHollywood\u2019s actors producers and directors pride themselves on celebrating freedom and the human spirit, and every year at the Academy Awards Americans are lectured about how this country falls short of Hollywood\u2019s ideals of social justice,\u201d Barr said.\u201cBut Hollywood now regularly censors its own movies to appease the Chinese Communist Party, the world\u2019s most powerful violator of human rights,\" Barr\u00a0 added. \"This censorship infects, not only the versions of movies that are released in China, but also many that are shown in the United States theaters to American audiences.\u201d", "comment": "(574)", "topic": "China", "date": " July 28"}, {"cover": "https://a57.foxnews.com/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/694940094001/3f7e2ff8-5619-4110-96dc-f4a2fc2a62f5/0423aeec-eed7-4f2c-a718-77fc1b810fd8/1280x720/match/156/88/image.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "title": "TikTok star leaves platform amid concerns over Chinese company misusing user data", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/media/tiktok-star-leaves-chinese-data-triller", "subtitle": "TikTok\u00a0star\u00a0Josh Richards is leaving the\u00a0social media app\u00a0over concerns\u00a0that\u00a0its\u00a0Chinese\u00a0parent\u00a0company misuses user data.\u00a0\u00a0", "keyword": "China and national Security", "website": "Fox News", "author": "Brian Flood", "content": "TikTok\u00a0star\u00a0Josh Richards is leaving the\u00a0social media app\u00a0 misuses user data.\u201cAfter seeing the U.S. and other countries\u2019 governments\u2019 concerns over\u00a0TikTok\u00a0\u2014 and given my responsibility to protect and lead my followers and other influencers \u2014 I followed my instincts as an entrepreneur and made it my mission to find a solution,\u201d\u00a0Richards told the .Richards, 18, who will leave behind over 20 million followers, has taken a position as\u00a0chief strategy officer at L.A.-based music video app\u00a0Triller, the Times reported.Fox News confirmed\u00a0Richards\u2019 new role.TikTok\u00a0influencers\u00a0Griffin Johnson, Noah Beck and Anthony Reeves will join Richards at\u00a0Triller\u00a0as\u00a0advisers.\u201cThe move is significant because it is one of the first organized U.S. efforts among prominent\u00a0TikTok\u00a0influencers to get people off the platform.

Beijing's approach has been clear for years,\" he continued. \"The People's Republic of China (PRC) has no legal grounds to unilaterally impose its will on the region.\"Pompeo underscored that Beijing has offered no coherent legal basis for its \"Nine-Dashed Line\" claim in the South China Sea since formally announcing it in 2009.In a unanimous decision on July 12, 2016, an Arbitral Tribunal constituted under the 1982 Law of the Sea Convention \u2013 to which the PRC is a state party \u2013 rejected the PRC's maritime claims as having no basis in international law. The tribunal sided squarely with the Philippines, which brought the arbitration case on almost all claims.At the time, Assistant Secretary of State for , David Stilwell,\u00a0 that Washington could double-down further with sanctions against Chinese officials and businesses involved in maligned South China Sea activity, vowing that the U.S. would \"no longer stay neutral on these maritime issues.\"Zack Cooper, a fellow at the American Enterprise Institue (AEI),\u00a0told Fox News that the legal statements by the U.S. make it clear that it views \"most Chinese maritime claims and activities in the South China Sea as illegal.\"\"Making this explicit opens the door to further U.S. moves to penalize destabilizing Chinese behavior, particularly its interference with fishing and oil and gas exploration by the other regional claimants, most notably the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei, and Indonesia,\" he continued.While the U.S. policy has in the past condemned China's territorial claims and expansion endeavors in and around the vital body of water, of which some $3 trillion worth of trade passes through annually, it has always called for disputes to be peacefully resolved by regional players. However, analysts note that the wording this week veers into outright rejection and puts the U.S. squarely at the center of the conflict.To further cap off the seriousness of the situation and demonstrate a commitment to freedom of navigation,\u00a0the U.S. warship Ralph Johnson also muscled through the territorially challenged waters on Tuesday.The South China Sea is home to pivotal shipping arteries, billions of barrels of oil and trillions of cubic feet of natural gas deposits and lucrative fisheries. It is dotted with contested islands and reefs, which are also vital to accessing these resources, and are  by other countries, including Malaysia, the Philippines, and Vietnam.\"It also serves as one of the world's most important trade routes, with about 30 percent of maritime trade flowing through the area annually. This is largely why the U.S. government advocates so strongly for freedom of navigation throughout the area \u2013 to deny China with an opportunity to potentially be in control of such an important waterway,\" noted Craig Singleton, adjunct fellow and an expert on China at the Foundation\u00a0for the Defense of Democracies (FDD).\nHowever, for more than a decade, the PRC leadership has become increasingly more aggressive in its centuries-old proclamations that the region belongs to them \u2013 and has gone on to bolster its military presence there and commands that its vessels have freedom of movement.In addition, Beijing has been busily building everything from defense locations such as hangars, bunkers, and runways to tourist resorts, schools, and modern apartments to farms, banks, hospitals, and communications capabilities.Moreover, Beijing has steadily re-settled local fishing communities and sent citizens to the region. In January 2019, the China Academy of Sciences even opened its doors to the \"Oceanographic Research Centre\" on Mischief Reef. In April this year, Beijing declared two more administrative districts. Earlier this month, the Communist leadership  fury by sealing off a section of the waterways to conduct naval drills. Ultimately, the region\u00a0is an essential part of China's \"Greater Bay Area economic development\" plan, and since 2012 has been intent on populating a number of islands.\"China would like to control all of the South China Sea, including its oil, gas, and fishing resources,\" Cooper conjectured. \"That puts it in conflict, however, with the U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea, which makes clear that China has only limited rights to the maritime zones in the South China Sea.\"And with much of the world distracted by the fallout of the coronavirus pandemic \u2013 which originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan last year \u2013 the PRC's activities in the waterways have only escalated in recent months, analysts conclude. Chinese barges have been accused of pursuing Malaysian oil-exploration boats, and at one point, slamming a Vietnamese-flagged fishing boat.\"China has steadily engaged in land reclamation and construction of military outposts throughout the South China Sea, even going so far as to install surface-to-air missiles, jamming equipment, and anti-ship missiles on some of these outposts,\" Singleton continued. \"China undertook these activities in violation of international law and in spite of a 2015 promise by Chinese President Xi Jinping to then-President Barack Obama that he would not militarize the area.\"It remains to be seen just how far Washington is willing to go to curb China's \"unlawful\" maneuvers.Earlier this month, the U.S.  two aircraft carrier strike groups \u2013 the USS Nimitz and USS Ronald Reagan \u2013 for joint operations in the South China Sea. Moreover, there is the P8-Poseidon Maritime Patrol Aircraft that traversed the sea, along with the U.S. Air Force's B-52 strategic bomber \u2013 all while China was conducting its own training nearby. The U.S. Navy is known to have undertaken at least six such operations throughout the first half of 2020 alone. China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs predictably  Pompeo's stinging words on Monday, calling them \"irresponsible\" and a distortion of international law that \"deliberately stokes territorial and maritime disputes, and undermines regional peace and stability.\"It also took aim at the U.S. military presence earlier this month with a state media outlet tweeting that \"any U.S. #aircraftcarrier movement in the region is at the pleasure\" of the Chinese military.But despite the ratcheting up of tensions this week \u2013 and the subsequent spurring of speculation that conflict could erupt at any moment in the resource-rich waterway \u2013 most experts assert that we are still far from an all-out brawl between the two superpowers.\"A war or other military conflict appears highly unlikely at this time,\" Singleton added. \"Although tensions will likely continue to escalate as the U.S. publicly challenges China's sovereignty claims over the region and its ongoing efforts to threaten other countries, including Vietnam.\"", "comment": "(4,005)", "topic": "China", "date": " July 15"}, {"cover": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/07/156/88/05_AP20197400984107.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "title": "China sees spike in COVID-19 cases 6 months after WHO declares coronavirus a health emergency", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/world/china-sees-spike-in-covid-19-cases-6-months-after-who-declares-coronavirus-a-health-emergency", "subtitle": "China on Thursday said it still has more than 18,000 people stuck in quarantine amid a spike\u00a0in COVID-19 cases across the country.\u00a0", "keyword": "China and national Security", "website": "Fox News", "author": "Barnini Chakraborty", "content": " on Thursday said it still has more than 18,000 people stuck in quarantine amid a spike\u00a0in  cases across the country.The admission comes six months\u00a0after the novel coronavirus was declared a global health emergency by the .

If she was caught, she knew she could be thrown in jail -- or, worse, rendered one of the \"disappeared.\"Yan told Fox News in an exclusive interview that she believes the\u00a0Chinese government\u00a0knew about the\u00a0\u00a0well before it claimed it did. She says her supervisors, renowned as some of the top experts in the field, also ignored research she was doing at the onset of the pandemic that she believes could have saved lives.She adds that they likely had an obligation to tell the world, given their status as a \u00a0reference laboratory specializing in influenza viruses and pandemics, especially as the virus began spreading in the early days of 2020.Yan, now in hiding, claims\u00a0the government in the country where she was born is trying to shred her reputation and accuses government\u00a0goons\u00a0of choreographing a cyber-attack against her in hopes of keeping her quiet.Yan believes her life is in danger. She fears she can never go back to her home\u00a0and lives with the hard truth that she\u2019ll likely never see her friends or family there again.Still, she says, the risk is worth it.\"The reason I came to the U.S. is because I deliver the message of the truth of COVID,\" she told Fox News from an undisclosed location.She added that if she tried to tell her story in China, she \"will be disappeared and killed.\"Yan's story weaves an extraordinary claim about cover-ups at the highest levels of government and seemingly exposes the obsessive compulsion of\u00a0President Xi Jinping\u00a0and his Communist Party to control the coronavirus narrative: what China knew, when it knew it and what edited information it peddled to the rest of the world.Yan, who says she was one of the first scientists in the world to study the novel coronavirus, was allegedly asked by her supervisor\u00a0at the University/WHO\u00a0reference lab,\u00a0Dr. Leo Poon,\u00a0in 2019\u00a0to look into the odd cluster of SARS-like cases coming out of mainland China at the end of December 2019.\"The China government refused to let overseas experts, including ones in Hong Kong, do research in China,\" she said. \"So I turned to my friends to get more information.\"Yan\u00a0had an extensive network of professional contacts in various medical facilities in mainland China, having grown up and completed much of her studies there. She says that is the precise reason she was asked to conduct this kind of research, especially at a time when she says her team knew they weren\u2019t getting the whole truth from the government.One friend, a scientist at the Center for Disease Control and Prevention in China, had first-hand knowledge of the cases and purportedly told Yan on Dec. 31 about human-to-human transmission well before China or the WHO admitted such spread was possible.She reported some of these early findings back to her boss, Yan said.\"He just nodded,\" she recalled, and told her to keep working.A few days later, on Jan. 9, 2020, the WHO put out a statement: \"According to Chinese authorities, the virus in question can cause severe illness in some patients and does not transmit readily between people... There is limited information to determine the overall risk of this reported cluster.\u201dYan said she and her colleagues across China discussed the peculiar virus but that she soon noted a sharp shift in tone.Doctors and researchers who had been openly discussing the virus suddenly clammed up. Those from the city of Wuhan--which later would become the hub of the outbreak--went silent and others were warned not to ask them details.The doctors said, ominously, \"We can't talk about it, but we need to wear masks,'\" Yan said.Then the numbers of human-to-human transmission began to grow exponentially, according to her sources, and Yan started digging for answers.\"There are many, many patients who don't get treatment on time and diagnosis on time,\" Yan said. \"Hospital doctors are scared, but they cannot talk. CDC staff are scared.\"She said she reported her findings to her supervisor again on Jan. 16 but that's when he allegedly told her \"to keep silent, and be careful.\"\"As he warned me before, 'Don't touch the red line,'\" Yan said referring to the government. \"We will get in trouble and we'll be disappeared.\"She also claims the co-director of a WHO-affiliated lab, , knew but didn't do anything about it.Peiris also did not respond to requests for comment. The WHO website lists Peiris as an \"adviser\" on the WHO International Health Regulations Emergency Committee for Pneumonia due to the Novel Coronavirus 2019-nCoV.Yan was frustrated, but not surprised.\"I already know that would happen because I know the corruption among this kind of international organization like the WHO to China government, and to China Communist Party,\" she said. \"So basically... I accept it but I don't want this misleading information to spread to the world.\"The WHO and China have vehemently denied claims of a coronavirus cover-up.The WHO has also denied that Yan, Poon or Peiris ever worked directly for the organization.\"Professor Malik Peiris is an infectious disease expert who has been on WHO missions and expert groups - as are many people eminent in their fields,\" WHO spokeswoman Margaret Ann Harris said in an email. \"That does not make him a WHO staff member, nor does he represent WHO.\"Yan says despite any pushback, she has been emboldened by a sense of right and wrong and says she had to speak up despite the personal and professional consequences.\"I know how they treat whistleblowers,\" she said.Like so many before her, once Yan decided to speak out against China, she discovered her life was apparently in jeopardy, as well as that of those closest to her.It was a\u00a0fear directly relayed to her and seemingly confirmed\u00a0by U.S.-based Hong Kong blogger\u00a0, she says.After she shared some of her theories and suspicions with him, he told her she would need to relocate, perhaps to the United States, where she wouldn't have to constantly look over her shoulder. Only then would she\u00a0be safe and\u00a0have a platform to speak, he said.Yan made the decision to leave, but things got complicated when her husband of six years, who also worked at her lab, discovered the telephone call between his wife and the blogger.Yan told Fox News she begged her husband\u00a0to go with her, and says while her spouse, a reputable scientist himself, had initially been supportive of her research, he suddenly had a change of heart.\"He was totally pissed off,\" she said. \"He blamed me, tried to ruin my confidence... He said they will kill all of us.'\"Shocked and hurt, Yan made the decision to leave without him.She got her ticket to the U.S. on April 27. She was on a flight the next day.When she landed at Los Angeles International Airport after her 13-hour journey, she was stopped by customs officials.Fear gripped her and Yan didn't know if she would end up in jail or be sent back to China.\"I had to tell them the truth,\" she said. \"I'm doing the right thing. So I tell them that 'don't let me go back to China. I'm the one who came to tell the truth here of COVID-19... And please protect me. If\u00a0not, the China government will kill me.\" was allegedly called in to investigate. Yan claims they interviewed her for hours, took her cell phone as evidence and allowed her to continue to her destination.The FBI told Fox News it could neither confirm nor deny Yan's claims; however, Fox News was shown an evidence receipt that appeared to confirm an interaction.As Yan was trying to find her footing in America, she says\u00a0her friends and family back home were being put through the wringer.Yan claims the government swarmed her hometown of Qingdao and that agents ripped apart her tiny apartment and questioned her parents. When she contacted her mother and father, they pleaded with her to come home, told her she didn't know what she was talking about and begged her to give up the fight.The University of Hong Kong took down her page\u00a0and apparently revoked access to her online portals and emails, despite the fact that she says she was on an approved annual leave. In a statement to Fox News, a school spokesperson said Yan is not currently an employee.\"Dr Li-Meng Yan is no longer a staff member of the University,\" the statement read. \"Out of respect for our current and former employees, we don\u2019t disclose personal information about her. Your understanding is appreciated.\"The Chinese Embassy in the United States\u00a0told Fox News they don't know who Yan is and maintain China has handled the pandemic heroically.\"We have never heard of this person,\" the emailed statement read.\u00a0\"The Chinese government has responded swiftly and effectively to COVID-19 since its outbreak. All its efforts have been clearly documented in the white paper \"Fighting COVID-19: China in Action\" with full transparency. Facts tell all.\"The WHO has also continued to deny any wrongdoing during the earliest days of the virus. The medical arm of the United Nations has been taken to task recently by scientists challenging its official view of how the virus spreads. The WHO has also altered the coronavirus timeline on its website, now saying it got information about the virus from WHO scientists and not the Beijing authorities--as it has claimed for more than six months.Fox News has also reached out to the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the scientists Yan accuses of suppressing her concerns for comment.Yan says she'll continue to speak out--but knows there's a target on her back.", "comment": "(16,777)", "topic": "Coronavirus", "date": " July 10"}, {"cover": "https://a57.foxnews.com/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/694940094001/65d14e79-2176-45e0-bcca-5b96d4e17bb0/77f33dc5-dae3-42f8-9963-2d7389f2b99b/1280x720/match/156/88/image.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "title": "Trump lashes out at Biden in Rose Garden: 'There's never been a time when two candidates were so different'", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-lashes-out-at-biden-in-rose-garden-theres-never-been-a-time-when-two-candidates-were-so-different", "subtitle": "Trump laid into his Democratic rival for his policy proposal on immigration, criminal justice reform and climate change among other issues.", "keyword": "China and national Security", "website": "Fox News", "author": "Andrew O'Reilly", "content": " veered off-script Tuesday after  against China to attack presumptive Democratic presidential nominee  for his recent policy proposals \u2013 accusing Biden of aligning his campaign with Vermont Sen.

Since the two nations signed phase one of a trade deal, the talks are currently stalled with virtually no hope of restarting before the November election.Trump\u2019s press conference started as an announcement that he had signed legislation and an executive order that he said will hold China accountable for its oppressive actions against the people of Hong Kong.The legislation and order are part of the Trump administration's offensive against China for what he calls unfair treatment by the rising Asian superpower, which hid details about the human-to-human transition of the coronavirus.Lawmakers from both parties have urged Trump to take strong action in response to China\u2019s new national security law that erodes the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d framework under which Britain handed Hong Kong over to China in 1997.

I'm Laura Ingraham. This is \"The Ingraham Angle\" from Washington tonight. Now, while he sees police force retires in droves, New York Mayor Bill de Blasio was personally putting the finishing touches on a Black Lives Matter mural in front of Trump Tower, that's going to create a lot of jobs Bill.Former NYPD Commissioner Bernie Kerik, oh, boy he's here. You don't want to miss it. It's going to be a scorcher.Also, ignoring the science on COVID has induced a war on American life. Now, we're now seeing this play out as colleges are curtailing and canceling football and other fall sports. Former coach, the great Lou Holtz is here to tell us why losing football is devastating for the American psyche.But first, \"Biden's America Last Campaign,\" that's the focus of \"Tonight's Angle.\" Joe Biden's campaign must obviously not be too confident in the polls, showing him up over the President, because if he was really confident why would he attempt a policy makeover this late in the campaign? Why would a guy who has been one of the worst apologists for globalism suddenly try to out Trump, Trump, by selling himself as a passionate believer in America first populism?(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOE BIDEN, D-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We're going to double this foreign tax -- the tax on foreign profits, so we don't encourage people to leave. I do not accept the defeat as you that forecast that automatic -- automation and globalization mean we can't keep well paid jobs here in America and create more of them. I do not buy it for one second, the vitality of American manufacturing is the thing of the past.(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM: Now, where have heard that before? Donald Trump. Well, Biden suddenly mimicking him, because his handlers know it's a huge weak spot. They know that in order to win, he's going to need some of that blue-collar love from voters in Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Wisconsin.Now, don't forget that according to RealClearPolitics, voters still approve of President Trump's handling the economy. So Joe's team, they decided that he should say something about the economy, don't you think other than promising to lock it down. Now, of course, he has nothing to say. He had almost 50 years to build a record on economic issues, and he utterly failed.So like the rest of his campaign, Biden's economic claims are just another act. They're sleight of hand. Based on his campaign's view that most Americans aren't that smart, and that the press, of course, will provide cover for all of his mistakes.Now, after all, this is the same guy who voted for one bad trade deal after another, including both NAFTA in that catastrophic decision to normalize trade relations with China. Now, that colossal mistake of a bill, not only fast-tracked China's nation -- China's entry into the WTO, but it also gutted American industry, and it destroyed millions of American jobs.Well, I forget almost that Biden was a vocal supporter of the Trans-Pacific Partnership. That was a deal that was so bad even Hillary Clinton could not defend it. She backed away from it. Now, to be fair to Biden, he probably didn't think too hard about any of these votes.After all, he's a Senator from Delaware -- he was, where lots of multinational companies get their charters, and he's probably just doing as he was told. Just like he'll do if he gets in the White House.Now, you think that a guy with almost five decades of political experience, would be proud to tout his record, but not Joe Biden. After decades of doing whatever the globalist wanted and pushing for policies and treaties that gutted American jobs and drove down wages. He wants you to believe that now at the age of almost 80, he's finally seen the error of his ways. At long last, he'll abandon the Clinton-Obama internationalist playbook.So all of a sudden he trundles over to scrim and read this speech designed to make it sound like someone who really cares about American workers. The whole charade is absurd on its face. It's basically an insult to our intelligence. Democrats have told us time and again, what they really think of saving key American industries.Now remember, he was Vice President for eight years, the Democrats had plenty of time to revise NAFTA, stand up to China and push policies that would lead to higher wages. They didn't do any of that. Instead, they promoted exactly the same type of outsourcing policies that the Bushes and the Clintons pushed, and Biden was with them every step of the way. So you want to know what Joe and his party really think of American workers, listen to them in their own words.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BIDEN: Anybody could go down 300 to 3,000 feet in the mind, sure in hell can learn how to program as well. Anybody can throw coal into a furnace, can learn how to program for god sake/HILLARY CLINTON, FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE: We're going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business.BARACK OBAMA, FORMER PRESIDENT: Some of those jobs of the past are just not going to come back.(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM: Maybe he's going to wave his magic wand. Oh, who's going to be able to renegotiate these deals? Obama said. Well, Trump was. Now, why am I not surprised that people who despise America would also despise American workers? Thank God, Trump never believed that defeat is nonsense. Trump didn't just promise to revise NAFTA, he got new provisions in it that would make it harder to ship auto jobs to Mexico.And he didn't just promise to stand up to China. He whacked them with tariffs for their cheating. And he didn't just promise to resist international bureaucrats, he shut down the WTO's Dispute Settlement system in response to its obvious anti-American bias.So is Joe Biden likely to continue fighting for American workers in the same way? Of course, not. Don't make me laugh, OK. I'm already laughing through his speech today. The moment the first Canadian or European bureaucrat raises an eyebrow, the moment the first member of the press asked a hard question, the moment the first CEO gets Biden on the phone, his administration will cave and the outsourcing party begins again.Of course, all of this will help the rich. Big hedge funds will be thrilled. They're desperate for the days of easy returns by selling out to the CCP, and Biden's just their man. Look at it this way. If Joe were truly a made in the USA kind of guy, would a guy like Mike Bloomberg be supporting him?Ignore the happy talk and the fake blue-collar events. To understand Biden's real agenda, we don't have to look any further than the 110-page document released yesterday, a joint product of the Biden campaign and the Bernie Bros. I prefer to call it Biden's roadmap to ruin.Now, a climate task force will push for a Green New Deal and calls for the U.S. to rejoin the Paris Accord. Leading the effort will be those well- known nationalists, John Kerry and AO.C Say goodbye to the U.S. energy sector, my friends, too bad Texas, tough luck, Pennsylvania.Then the criminal justice task force, that will boast an impressive roster of big thinkers, including Senator Biden aide, Symone Sanders. \"The Washington Post\" described her as someone who pushed the campaign to be wary of language that frustrates black activists, urging staffers to avoid the term white working class.Mr. Fast and Furious himself, former Obama AG Eric Holder, also took part. Well, their demands are a law enforcement nightmare. Federal use of force standards, making it easier to sue police, national registry of police officers who abuse power -- whatever that means, repealing mandatory minimums, expunging all past convictions for pot and juvenile criminal activities, no prison time at all for failure to pay fines for child support, no cash bail, and appointing activist judges -- that'll be a varsity sport.So there's a lot in there that's great for Tony Soprano and his crew maybe, but nothing for law abiding citizens. To Biden in this team, that's what you get for liking America. Of course, such an array of radical ideas is only going to ensure more racial injustice.And isn't that you are trying many of these same proposals about the police and defunding them as we speak? And look what's happening there. We have massive police retirements, massive crime, the President talked about it tonight. People with money are leaving New York City in droves. So imagine those policies of Bill de Blasio coming to a neighborhood near you? Well, unlike Biden, Trump doesn't have to pretend to believe in America first. He's already proven it.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: It was always, yes, China will catch America. We took in tens of billions of dollars in tariffs that they paid for.Our immigration system is stretched far beyond the breaking point. To confront this national security crisis, I declared a national emergency.Many emergency declarations have been used to protect people in faraway nations. Now we are protecting, finally, our people.-- add that under my administration, we've delivered $1.5 billion for public charter schools. That's a record.(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM: Now watching Biden, on the other hand, trying to pretend to care about, oh, the schools, the kids, the blue-collar workers, it's almost a repellent. Almost every action in his career and of his party now, and virtually everything that Democrat Party wants today, represents an attack on the middle class -- traditional American families, working Americans.Team Biden will ship your jobs to china and lock you in your homes. They'd shut down churches and schools, they'd let rioters loot and burn, they'd punish the police and free the criminals. This November pay no attention to empty Democrat promises about all the free stuff they're finally going to give you. I've been listening to those promises my whole life. If they had any meaning, we'd all be on Easy Street by now.Remember the jobs we lost to China, the storefronts destroyed by the riots, the cops threatened and humiliated by Left Wing nuts, the kids who still can't go to school. That's the real Democratic Party, and they're coming for you. And that's \"The Angle.\"Joining me now is Larry Kudlow, White House economic adviser. Larry, good to see you tonight. If Biden was serious about empowering American workers, he did the big populist push today. Why didn't he actually do that during his 40 plus years in DC?LARRY KUDLOW, NATIONAL ECONOMIC COUNCIL DIRECTOR: Well, it's good point. He had his chance, particularly with Obama, last eight years before President Trump. We had one of the worst recoveries in history.Look, you go down the list and look at that campaign document, first of all, he intends to repeal every tax cut that President Trump put in to rejuvenate the economy. And let me make this point, despite the mantra of the Democrats that all tax cuts help the rich.The Trump tax cuts did exactly what we hoped. That is, middle income, blue collar workers, lower wage earners performed the best, not only with the lowest unemployment rate in history, but their wage increase was faster than the top 1 percent. And the unemployment rates for African Americans and Hispanics and Asians and women were at historic lows.Plus, Biden's going to add new taxes, today he said by the way. He does want to have the stock market. He doesn't want to have shareholders involved in the stock market. Well, besides pension funds, and even union pension funds 51 percent are invested in the stock market, which I might add is up 40 percent since the laws.He's going to rewrite all of the regulatory reductions that President Trump put in to help small businesses --INGRAHAM: Oh, it's going to be a nightmare.KUDLOW: --to hire workers.INGRAHAM: Nightmare.KUDLOW: He's for the Green New Deal, which will -- and he can talk about coal mines all he wants. But if you go with the Green New Deal, that means all fossil fuels gone.INGRAHAM: Well, it's Biden energy sector.KUDLOW: It will have an incredibly negative effect on the economy.INGRAHAM: Larry, let me get in here. Let me get in here, because I think what Biden sees, obviously, he's had a disadvantage in arguing these points. It's obvious. His whole career speaks to internationalism and exporting jobs to china.But he also can say now, because you all have and done it, I'm going to bring back drug manufacturing. I'm going to do this. Trump says he was going to do it from China. I'm going to do it. Why hasn't the Trump administration moved on that order? I know Peter Navarro and others have been pushing. It was reported today. Why are we not bringing back some of these drugs and bringing them back stat, to use a medical term.KUDLOW: Well, but that's exactly what we're trying to do. Not only pharmaceuticals, but semiconductors --INGRAHAM: Well, what's holding it up?KUDLOW: --retailers. Well, there's nothing holding it up. We are -- when we come out with our program, we're already in discussion with lots of companies based in China. We had a discussion today. A leading semiconductor company is selling their factories in China and coming back home. We will give them the lowest corporate tax rates, we will give them perhaps tax credits, certainly 100 percent expensing. We may use some government funds to pay for their moving costs.We have a whole campaign planned. We're warning American investors not to invest in Chinese stocks because of the fraudulent accounting. Robert O'Brien and I have already warned, the Thrift Savings Plan and the Railroad Retirement Fund. So we are doing exactly that. And we're taking steps to deal with this Hong Kong disaster. So I don't think it's right to say we haven't done it. We've been doing it.And the tax reform itself, we made it so easy to repatriate profits and capital come back to the United States. In a second Trump term, you'll see a lot more of that.INGRAHAM: And so we -- you can commit tonight that we will bring back these crucial drugs and the manufacturing, even if the price goes up a little bit at home, in order to secure our stockpile of critical medications?KUDLOW: I think, Laura, that we learned -- not the only country, other countries. But United States learned that China is not to be trusted, period, full stop. And that we cannot rely on these long-complicated supply chains coming out of China. I think you'll see the whole business community.You don't see business school professors saying now the supply chains don't work. We got to bring it back home, because China is not reliable. They're not the only ones who are unreliable. But I hear the same thing for people around the world, so that's going to be a major change.But we have got to continue low taxes and deregulation and fair-trade deals. If we do that, we will come through this pandemic, I think we're going to get 20 percent growth in the second half. Hopefully, the virus hotspots will be subdued and mitigated, and I think we're going to have a big bang in 2021.We were coming into this strong, you know that. The tax cuts worked, deregulation worked, the energy worked, the trade worked.INGRAHAM: In real short --KUDLOW: We just had the USMCA. We just had the USMCA. President Obrador was here. A lot of goodwill. That's(CROSSTALK)INGRAHAM: Larry, real quick --KUDLOW: --percentage points to GDP.INGRAHAM: Real quick. Isn't it really important that people understand, comparing our response to COVID to Europe's response, our economy is faring far better than the major European countries. I don't think a lot of voters know that. But when you look at the charts, it's undeniable. Trump's policies, post COVID are working economically. Biden wants to turn that back by locking us all down as do those Democrat mayors. Real quick, Larry.KUDLOW: Well, we -- look, we have a strong V shaped recovery. There's some recovery in Europe, by the way, but we do have a strong recovery. Let me just say this in closing.I am concerned about the virus hotspots -- and I will say this. If you want to reopen our economy, if you want to let the President rebuild our economy for the second time, the best thing we can do is take the safety measures, use the face mask. The President said that tonight with Sean. Keep the distancing. The testing is so important in the hotspots and personal hygiene. If you practice that, then we will stabilize the hotspots and we will be off to the races in a strong economy. That's where we started, and it can continue.INGRAHAM: Larry great to see it. Tonight, thanks so much for joining us.And American cities are already getting a preview of what life will be like under the Biden administration. Angry mobs burning down businesses, defacing monuments. Of course, we see the rampant crime, and all-out assault on police by the people who are supposed to be leading the people and keeping them safe. It'll only get worse if Biden wins.Joining me now Bernie Kerik, former NYPD Commissioner. Bernie, you've heard me in \"The Angle.\" No cash bail, no prison for not paying child support. I don't need to repeat the whole thing. This is what Biden's plan is. What will that mean for Americans streets, neighborhoods, communities?BERNARD KERIK, FORMER NYPD COMMISSIONER: Chaos. Chaos, violent crime, murder. We already know in every one of the Democratic cities around the country. The major cities like Chicago and Baltimore and Milwaukee, Minnesota, places like that. They're already the highest crime -- the highest violent crime, the highest murder rates. It's only going to get worse.This diminishing, defunding the police departments is going to create mass chaos. We're seeing it right here with the reductions that this mayor has already started on reducing the street crime units, the plainclothes units.INGRAHAM: Well, the NYPD, Bernie, is seeing this disturbing mass exodus. \"National Review\" said that 179 cops filed for retirement between June 29th and Monday, a 411 percent increase over the 35 who filed during the same period last year. So this is exactly what the Black Lives Matter and the radical left want to see happen, right? Drive police out of the streets, drive police off the force and demoralize the population, so they just say, OK, I'll vote for Biden to make it stop, I guess.KERIK: And that's what the mayor did today. By standing on Fifth Avenue, drawing that mural for Black Lives Matter, knowing that this is a trained Marxist group, that they were inspired by a domestic terrorists convicted of killing a cop, that they've called for the murders of cops, that they've yelled and chant, \"pigs in a blanket, fry like bacon,\" \"the only good cops are dead cops.\"They're responsible for all the riots in 44 states, 76 cities around the country that injured 500 cops. He's out there painting that mural. You know what that says to every New York City cop? I despise you. I despise you.And he himself -- and I got to remind people of this. He is no better than the founders of Black Lives Matter, the Marxist. He himself is a Marxist. If you go back to 1987 when he was 26 years old. He was the guy standing out there saying Nicaragua's troubles are my troubles too, supporting the Sandinistas. He's a lunatic. He should not be in office.INGRAHAM: Well, New York -- I mean, will New York ever wake up or is this the city they want? Because everyone I know is leaving New York. Bernie. It's a complete disgrace. Thank you for your words of wisdom tonight.And the media was downright giddy about the Supreme Court's ruling on Trump's tax returns. But they were wrong. They shouldn't be. Our legal Eagles will explain why this actually might be a huge political victory for Trump. You bet. Stay there.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)ARI MELBER, MSNBC CHIEF LEGAL CORRESPONDENT: A big loss for President Trump here.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I find this to be a very dark day for Donald Trump. This is his greatest fear.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: If he doesn't win reelection, he is potentially going to see a criminal indictment as a private person.NEAL KATYAL, FORMER FEDERAL PROSECUTOR: I'm Donald Trump. I am scared right now.(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM: It's scary that the guy was the Solicitor General of the United States. Well, the truth is that one of the rulings today completely destroyed Congress's gross unconstitutional overstep in trying to obtain Trump's tax returns.So yes, the High Court did rule that the Manhattan D.A. Cyrus Vance could subpoena the tax documents. But it's not the stirring victory the Left would have you believe. You actually have to read the opinions.Now, first, the case was remanded back to the lower court, where Trump's lawyers can make more constitutional arguments to draw up the case. And second, even if a court expedites its decision, the tax returns would go to a grand jury, meaning they'll still be secret.Now, in fact, the Manhattan D.A. may not see the President's tax returns for many more months or many more years. This is just harassment, come on. In other words, there's almost zero chance that Trump's taxes become public before the November election.Joining me now is John Eastman, Claremont Institute Senior Fellow, Constitutional Scholar; also Sol Wisenberg, former deputy independent counsel. So you say this isn't really the win that Vance in New York thinks it is, why?SOL WISENBERG, DEP WHITEWATER INDEPENDENT COUNSEL: Well, even though President Trump and the DOJ lost on their overall legal argument. Remember, all the court said was that the President does not have absolute immunity from state criminal processes.But that's kind of a theoretical question, Laura, they then send it back to the lower courts, as you say, and President Trump is free to say all right. But in this particular instance, this subpoena is a problem. This subpoena, for example, is nothing but a retaliatory effort to interfere with my executive powers.They're still free to make any argument they want with respect to the particular subpoena. Why was it issued at this particular time? Why do you want my -- why exactly do you need these tax returns? So, yes, they lost on their legal points, which I don't think most people thought they were going to win on anyway. But as a practical matter, I think it's a win, certainly in the short term.INGRAHAM: John, your thoughts on this. This seems like this opens the door in a way for any rogue, State AG or DA to harass the President of the United States anytime they have an ideological dispute, not to impart bad motives on all Democrat DAs. But it certainly opens up a can of worms down the road for other Presidents, perhaps.JOHN EASTMAN, CLAREMONT INSTITUTE SENIOR FELLOW: Well, it does open it up perhaps. But I agree with Sol, and that's not what -- I mean, I was watching the news today and wondered whether the news reports were reading the same opinion I was reading. I mean, I think the Chief Justice, and the and the large majority of the court went out of its way to try and prevent that kind of rogue district attorney from harassing the President.He said the entire the entire conduct of the proceeding needs to be conducted with the fact that this is the President of United States and the Office of Chief Executive in mind. And it specifically says that the President can challenge these subpoenas as an attempt to influence the performance of his duties that would violate the supremacy clause.And so, you don't have absolute immunity from the subpoena, but we're not going to allow witch hunts for partisan political gain against a sitting president or a presidential candidate. And I think the court made clear on that.So I don't think this is a win for Vance at all. The Second Circuit decision was affirmed, and that just means the president doesn't have absolute immunity, but the things that are handed to him are more than enough to force him having to disclose.INGRAHAM: Got it. Sol, I want to move on to John Durham, because there's so many people waiting for the results of his investigation, but FOX News is reporting exclusively that Durham does not want this to be viewed politically, and the closer it gets to November, Durham could punt it until after the election. Sol, if this report is delayed until after election, it's never going to the light of day, we might not ever know what was really down to the president or what nefarious efforts were undertaken at the FBI and beyond.WISENBERG: First of all, we don't know that there's going to be a report. He's not a report, he's not a special counsel. He may just tell the story in any indictments that get issued. I would also say there's a considerable amount of time between an election if the president loses and the following term.But listen, I have a lot of faith in Durham. He's got a sterling reputation. And as Attorney General Barr said -- first of all, Attorney General Barr said he doesn't think there is even going to be in an investigation, a criminal investigation of former President Obama or President Biden. If you take those two out of the equation, as Barr said, who are we going to be looking that is going to be running for office? Nobody. So I don't really -- I'll believe it when I see it. I think Durham is being methodical. He doesn't want anyone to say that this is political on his part, and given his reputation, I don't think they will.INGRAHAM: John, really quickly, your reaction to the shocking decision by Federal District Judge Emmet Sullivan to refuse to dismiss the case against Flynn. He is now asking the appeals court en banc to rule about whether to keep the Flynn case alive. John, real quick.EASTMAN: Did he not get the basic separation of powers thing? He doesn't get to bring motions to another court. He's not the party in the case. He doesn't get to appoint his own prosecutor. He is supposed to be the judge. This is just getting laughable. But I hope the en banc circuit, D.C. circuit will slap it down, and slap the judge down too, rather than just the case.INGRAHAM: If you can sanction the judge in this case, I would be all for that. This is a travesty. We've got to roll. Guys, thanks so much.And despite the fact that college aged students are extremely low risk as the task force said yesterday, various leagues now have already started canceling their sports in the fall. Legendary former Notre Dame coach Lou Holtz is here next. Why canceling football is not just ignoring science but could actually crush the American spirit. Stay there.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)INGRAHAM: I was thinking about this today, what we are in the middle of here, it kind of amounts to a war against our way of life. Because after the riots subsided and it became clear that the U.S. economy was improving, and improving really rapidly under President Trump's policies, I think the left and started to freak out a little bit. Can't have all those people working at having fun again. So how could they keep the panic and anxiety going to ensure a Biden victory?(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Dr. Fauci says the United States is knee-deep in the crisis.DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES: I think any state that is having a serious problem, that state should seriously look at shutting down.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Look how steep that curve is, and you think the only way now to change that is to shut down?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We're not dropping cases in our immunity with tests and trace and masking, then yes.(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM: Deaths are going down, cases are going up, so no fun for America.OK, now, a few states of course have seen the rise in positive cases, but again, the daily death rate has been dropping like a rock since peaking in April. This is actually good news. We're getting closer to herd immunity in some sectors of the United States. We also have T cell immunity, talked about that the other night. So it's a serious disease, especially, though, for the old and vulnerable. Most people do quite well with it under the age of 25, most people will be fine, again, with some rare exceptions. Kids who are college aged and younger, what about them?(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DR. DEBORAH BIRX, WHITE HOUSE CORONAVIRUS RESPONSE COORDINATOR: We know that mortality rate in under 25 from the CDC data is less than 0.1 percent.We have no evidence that there is significant mortality in children without coexisting diseases.(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM: So despite this extremely low risk for young people with COVID, colleges around the country seem to be rushing into the fearmongering stage, the panic stage. And the left seems to enjoy this moment where sports seems to be ending.Now yesterday, the Ivy League announced it would cancel all sports in the fall, including football. Just how big a deal is this? Yale won't be playing Princeton or Harvard for the first time since World War II. As expected, the dominoes continue to fall. From there, the Big Ten said today it wouldn't allow any out of conference games for football or any other sport, citing these unprecedented times. But at the end of the day, the commissioner couldn't even promise that.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)KEVIN WARREN, BIG TEN COMMISSIONER: One thing we have to realize is that this is not a fait accompli that we're going to have sports in the fall. We may not have sports in the fall. We may not have a college football season in the Big Ten.(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM: Well, this mindset isn't just taking over colleges, it's trickling down the high schools well. Superintendent of Dallas public schools, have some good football teams there, made this stunning announcement today.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MICHAEL HINOJOSA, DALLAS INDEPENDENT SCHOOL DISTRICT SUPERINTENDENT: I seriously doubt it. I don't know. We're not in control of that. The university interscholastically gives us guidance on that. But that's a true contact sport. I don't know how we can pull it off. There's been some discussion of moving it to the spring, but we'll have to wait and see. I seriously doubt we can pull it off.(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM: Because there is no inherent risk in playing football. The kids don't out there and put their health at risk just playing the sport. Specifically, one of the greatest coaches of all time is Lou Holtz, Notre Dame Hall of Fame coach. Lou, I'm so glad you're here tonight. I say this kind of feels like a war on American life. No church, no singing, no school, no football. Where does it end?LOU HOLTZ, FOOTBALL ANALYST: I think it ends when we have the election. When you're in a leadership role, Laura, you have to look at things from both points of view. As a coach I'd look at it from a player's point of view as well as from a coach's point of view. The way it is right now, they just don't want to have sports, and there's no way in this world you can do anything in this world without a risk. People stormed Normandy. I took some grandchildren over there. They knew there was going to be casualties, they knew there was going to be risk, but it was a way of life.Now if you eliminate all nonconference games, first of all, you have seven teams in the Big Ten that schedule four patsies so they know they're going to win four games, with two conference games, they can go to the bowl. That ain't going to happen. But let me tell you the devastating effect it's going to have is then the nonpower five schools, my son is head coach at Louisiana Tech. He used to play Baylor, Vanderbilt, those are money games, those are very, very important. But how are you going to have football when they don't even want to have school? Some schools like Notre Dame has said, OK, we're going to start on August 10th. Now some of faculty members say, oh, it's too risky, I don't want to go. You have teachers' unions saying you shouldn't go back to school. The underprivileged, the people from the poor neighborhoods, where they going to get education? What has happened to our way of life? Look at it from both points of view. The risk is always there, but you cannot just look at it from one side, and that's exactly what's happening. And I think it will end on Election Day.INGRAHAM: Lou, it seems to me that there are a lot of people on the left especially who have wanted to get rid of football for some time. All the op-eds about, of course it's a dangerous sport, it's a brutal sport, it's a misogynistic sport. Football has been trashed by the left for a couple of decades. So you get the sense that they think they have football right where they want it. But Notre Dame, Alabama, even some of those Ivy League schools, the Pac 10, Ohio, the Buckeyes, they all want to play football. When are we going to hear from coaches and players who say let us assume the risk? We'll assume the risk, let our players play. Are we going to hear from any of them or no?HOLTZ: I don't think so, but if I were coaching I would sure speak up. I've had people say I don't want my son to play football so I'm going to go buy him a motorcycle so he'll have something to do other than football.I want to tell you, Laura. I can't begin to tell you the lessons people learn in football. It's a microcosm of life. You learn about sacrifice, you learn about teamwork, getting along with other people. You learn to work on your skills to make sacrifices, to make a total commitment to other people for the welfare of the overall team and unit. There is so many valuable lessons you learn from it, and when you are part of a team, people want to be part of something. That is how games came about. When they started emphasizing athletics in schools, then people started enjoying the game, because young people wanted to be part of something, and you are that away from them?INGRAHAM: Coach, I want to quickly get to your view on the now push to get Notre Dame to reconsider the Fighting Irish nickname. OK, as a former coach at Notre Dame, what are your thoughts on that? Apparently, that is now politically incorrect.HOLTZ: I think that's ridiculous. They were named the Fighting Irish because the Ku Klux Klan tried to attack the Catholics. They went down and fought the Ku Klux Klan, and that is where the name the Fighting Irish came. Now day you're going to tell me they want to topple my statue Notre Dame. That is when I will really get mad.INGRAHAM: Coach Holtz, before we go, on behalf of all of us at \"The Ingraham Angle,\" I want to express our great condolences for your incredible wife, the lovely Beth. I know you were married for 58 years. She was an amazing woman, and I know it just hurts in your heart, and we heard for you, coach.HOLTZ: Thank you, Laura. If I could make one comment, we had the funeral at Notre Dame Basilica, there couldn't be many people, but we have gotten so many thousands of texts and emails. I wish they had done it when she was alive. So everybody listen, please sit down while somebody's still living and tell them the difference they made in your life. Do it while they can appreciate it. Thank you.INGRAHAM: Lou, we will, and you have made a huge difference to so many players and alumni and students and me, personally, over the years. So thank you so much for everything you do. We really appreciate it.HOLTZ: Thank you. Now I have to watch your program alone. And I enjoy your program, but it will be sad.INGRAHAM: Thanks so much, Lou.HOLTZ: Thank you.INGRAHAM: And being a medical professional who tells the truth about COVID figures gets you smeared professionally, ostracized, even targeted by medical boards. Two men who found themselves in that position at times are here with their stories, next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)INGRAHAM: For challenging the medical establishment, may be the medical deep state, and exposing a massive flaw in our COVID response, my next two guests have found themselves on the wrong side of that medical mafia. Here now is Dr. Scott Jensen, physician, Minnesota state senator, and Dr. Stephen Smith, founder of the Smith Center for Infectious Diseases and Urban Health. Dr. Jensen, you found legitimate flaws in the CDC's guidelines. Now you're being targeted by your state's health board. Explain briefly.DR. SCOTT JENSEN, PHYSICIAN: Basically, I'm being told that because I questioned the Department of Health and the CDC's communications that I've been spreading misinformation. I think this is ludicrous. If you want to know who is spreading misinformation, if the governor comes out and tells Minnesotans they are going to have 74,000 deaths and then later on reduces it to 29,000 deaths, and then later on gives us another statistic and says in mid-July, which is next week, we're going to have 1,000 deaths per day, to me that would be more misinformation than me saying hey, listen, death certificates are a serious thing and we should be doing it right.INGRAHAM: Dr. Smith, you've turned into a pariah of sorts by your own hospital because of your advocacy for and use of, successfully, I might add, hydroxychloroquine. Tell us about it.DR. STEPHEN SMITH, SMITH CENTER OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES: In the beginning when I adopted the French regimen, which was 600 milligrams a day, as opposed to the 2,400 milligrams lower dose that people were using, CDC, actually the FDA eventually endorsed, I got immediate pushback from the CMO at one of the hospitals we go to. Immediate. Like, we'll take it from here, Stephen, after I sent them the article. I said, what? He came in on a Saturday and I was still in the hospital working my tail off, and I said, no, you won't touch my patients.And since then, I don't know why -- I didn't know I was creating controversy. I thought I was following the data like I always do. And it's a safe drug, a cheap drug. And I got in another argument with the CMO of the system. He said, if we give everybody 600 milligrams a day, which is only 6,000, as opposed to 2,400 milligrams, we're going to run out of hydroxychloroquine. I said I don't believe him. He hung up on me. That was after maybe I had spent three hours taking care of 50 of his patients.INGRAHAM: Earlier today, earlier today Dr. Fauci was asked if we can control COVID without a vaccine. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES: I think we can get it under control but keeping it under control is going to be the real problem. This virus, to our dismay, is spectacularly efficient in transmitting from person to person. That makes me skeptical whether we would get permanent, sustained control of this without having a vaccine.(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM: OK, Dr. Jensen. The translation -- get ready to be locked down until Biden is elected. I'm sorry, I hear that, and my blood boils. It is a virus, it's a bad virus, but most people do fine with it. Could this be with us forever? And vaccines aren't 100 percent useful anyway, in most cases.JENSEN: I would ask Dr. Fauci why in the world he would use the word \"spectacularly.\" That sounds like just fearmongering. And I would ask, what RNA viruses have we been successful at in terms of creating a vaccine that really does what we want? We know that with our influenza vaccine, we frequently face just terribly mediocre results. And if you look at other coronavirus viruses, whether you're talking about SARS or MERS, we don't have a great track record. So the fact of the matter is, if a vaccine comes along to help us, that's great, but we are far more realistically leaning into herd immunity.INGRAHAM: Yes, the Henry Ford Health System study on hydroxy has come under fire. Not only was the study not randomized, outside experts noting the patients who received hydroxy were also more likely to get steroids. Dr. Smith, you've read the study, you've treated all these patients successfully. What are your thoughts?SMITH: It's really hard to -- actually it's harder to show something works than doesn't work. And obviously we've had several trials showing this drug or drug combination works very well. Our data support that. There are many other trials that show that. And when you see efficacy, you really take notice, because, again, it's harder to prove something works in this situation then to say it's neutral. It's a lot easier to say he doesn't have an effect for a bunch of reasons.INGRAHAM: And it's a generic drug and it doesn't cause $4,000 a course like remdesivir. Gentlemen, thank you so much. Great to see you.An important Last Bite, next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BAIER: A policy of never-ending lockdowns month after month would ultimately do more harm than good to public health, and so bad for our children. As a result, it really is more loss of life. We can't do that. We have to get back now. We did it right. We saved millions of lives by what we did.(END VIDEO CLIP)", "comment": "", "topic": "TRANSCRIPT", "date": " July 9"}, {"cover": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/07/156/88/DURUM-UP-CLOSE.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "title": "Virginia, Utah residents report receiving unsolicited packets of seeds in the mail reportedly from China", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/us/virginia-utah-unsolicited-seeds-china", "subtitle": "Virginia residents have been advised not to plant any unsolicited seeds they may have received in the mail, the state\u2019s Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services has advised.", "keyword": "China and national Security", "website": "Fox News", "author": "Peter Aitken", "content": " residents have been advised not to plant any unsolicited  they may have received in the mail, the state\u2019s Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services (VADACS) has advised.

I'm Laura Ingraham. This is \"The Ingraham Angle\" from Washington tonight. Now, while he sees police force retires in droves, New York Mayor Bill de Blasio was personally putting the finishing touches on a Black Lives Matter mural in front of Trump Tower, that's going to create a lot of jobs Bill.Former NYPD Commissioner Bernie Kerik, oh, boy he's here. You don't want to miss it. It's going to be a scorcher.Also, ignoring the science on COVID has induced a war on American life. Now, we're now seeing this play out as colleges are curtailing and canceling football and other fall sports. Former coach, the great Lou Holtz is here to tell us why losing football is devastating for the American psyche.But first, \"Biden's America Last Campaign,\" that's the focus of \"Tonight's Angle.\" Joe Biden's campaign must obviously not be too confident in the polls, showing him up over the President, because if he was really confident why would he attempt a policy makeover this late in the campaign? Why would a guy who has been one of the worst apologists for globalism suddenly try to out Trump, Trump, by selling himself as a passionate believer in America first populism?(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOE BIDEN, D-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We're going to double this foreign tax -- the tax on foreign profits, so we don't encourage people to leave. I do not accept the defeat as you that forecast that automatic -- automation and globalization mean we can't keep well paid jobs here in America and create more of them. I do not buy it for one second, the vitality of American manufacturing is the thing of the past.(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM: Now, where have heard that before? Donald Trump. Well, Biden suddenly mimicking him, because his handlers know it's a huge weak spot. They know that in order to win, he's going to need some of that blue-collar love from voters in Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Wisconsin.Now, don't forget that according to RealClearPolitics, voters still approve of President Trump's handling the economy. So Joe's team, they decided that he should say something about the economy, don't you think other than promising to lock it down. Now, of course, he has nothing to say. He had almost 50 years to build a record on economic issues, and he utterly failed.So like the rest of his campaign, Biden's economic claims are just another act. They're sleight of hand. Based on his campaign's view that most Americans aren't that smart, and that the press, of course, will provide cover for all of his mistakes.Now, after all, this is the same guy who voted for one bad trade deal after another, including both NAFTA in that catastrophic decision to normalize trade relations with China. Now, that colossal mistake of a bill, not only fast-tracked China's nation -- China's entry into the WTO, but it also gutted American industry, and it destroyed millions of American jobs.Well, I forget almost that Biden was a vocal supporter of the Trans-Pacific Partnership. That was a deal that was so bad even Hillary Clinton could not defend it. She backed away from it. Now, to be fair to Biden, he probably didn't think too hard about any of these votes.After all, he's a Senator from Delaware -- he was, where lots of multinational companies get their charters, and he's probably just doing as he was told. Just like he'll do if he gets in the White House.Now, you think that a guy with almost five decades of political experience, would be proud to tout his record, but not Joe Biden. After decades of doing whatever the globalist wanted and pushing for policies and treaties that gutted American jobs and drove down wages. He wants you to believe that now at the age of almost 80, he's finally seen the error of his ways. At long last, he'll abandon the Clinton-Obama internationalist playbook.So all of a sudden he trundles over to scrim and read this speech designed to make it sound like someone who really cares about American workers. The whole charade is absurd on its face. It's basically an insult to our intelligence. Democrats have told us time and again, what they really think of saving key American industries.Now remember, he was Vice President for eight years, the Democrats had plenty of time to revise NAFTA, stand up to China and push policies that would lead to higher wages. They didn't do any of that. Instead, they promoted exactly the same type of outsourcing policies that the Bushes and the Clintons pushed, and Biden was with them every step of the way. So you want to know what Joe and his party really think of American workers, listen to them in their own words.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BIDEN: Anybody could go down 300 to 3,000 feet in the mind, sure in hell can learn how to program as well. Anybody can throw coal into a furnace, can learn how to program for god sake/HILLARY CLINTON, FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE: We're going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business.BARACK OBAMA, FORMER PRESIDENT: Some of those jobs of the past are just not going to come back.(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM: Maybe he's going to wave his magic wand. Oh, who's going to be able to renegotiate these deals? Obama said. Well, Trump was. Now, why am I not surprised that people who despise America would also despise American workers? Thank God, Trump never believed that defeat is nonsense. Trump didn't just promise to revise NAFTA, he got new provisions in it that would make it harder to ship auto jobs to Mexico.And he didn't just promise to stand up to China. He whacked them with tariffs for their cheating. And he didn't just promise to resist international bureaucrats, he shut down the WTO's Dispute Settlement system in response to its obvious anti-American bias.So is Joe Biden likely to continue fighting for American workers in the same way? Of course, not. Don't make me laugh, OK. I'm already laughing through his speech today. The moment the first Canadian or European bureaucrat raises an eyebrow, the moment the first member of the press asked a hard question, the moment the first CEO gets Biden on the phone, his administration will cave and the outsourcing party begins again.Of course, all of this will help the rich. Big hedge funds will be thrilled. They're desperate for the days of easy returns by selling out to the CCP, and Biden's just their man. Look at it this way. If Joe were truly a made in the USA kind of guy, would a guy like Mike Bloomberg be supporting him?Ignore the happy talk and the fake blue-collar events. To understand Biden's real agenda, we don't have to look any further than the 110-page document released yesterday, a joint product of the Biden campaign and the Bernie Bros. I prefer to call it Biden's roadmap to ruin.Now, a climate task force will push for a Green New Deal and calls for the U.S. to rejoin the Paris Accord. Leading the effort will be those well- known nationalists, John Kerry and AO.C Say goodbye to the U.S. energy sector, my friends, too bad Texas, tough luck, Pennsylvania.Then the criminal justice task force, that will boast an impressive roster of big thinkers, including Senator Biden aide, Symone Sanders. \"The Washington Post\" described her as someone who pushed the campaign to be wary of language that frustrates black activists, urging staffers to avoid the term white working class.Mr. Fast and Furious himself, former Obama AG Eric Holder, also took part. Well, their demands are a law enforcement nightmare. Federal use of force standards, making it easier to sue police, national registry of police officers who abuse power -- whatever that means, repealing mandatory minimums, expunging all past convictions for pot and juvenile criminal activities, no prison time at all for failure to pay fines for child support, no cash bail, and appointing activist judges -- that'll be a varsity sport.So there's a lot in there that's great for Tony Soprano and his crew maybe, but nothing for law abiding citizens. To Biden in this team, that's what you get for liking America. Of course, such an array of radical ideas is only going to ensure more racial injustice.And isn't that you are trying many of these same proposals about the police and defunding them as we speak? And look what's happening there. We have massive police retirements, massive crime, the President talked about it tonight. People with money are leaving New York City in droves. So imagine those policies of Bill de Blasio coming to a neighborhood near you? Well, unlike Biden, Trump doesn't have to pretend to believe in America first. He's already proven it.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: It was always, yes, China will catch America. We took in tens of billions of dollars in tariffs that they paid for.Our immigration system is stretched far beyond the breaking point. To confront this national security crisis, I declared a national emergency.Many emergency declarations have been used to protect people in faraway nations. Now we are protecting, finally, our people.-- add that under my administration, we've delivered $1.5 billion for public charter schools. That's a record.(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM: Now watching Biden, on the other hand, trying to pretend to care about, oh, the schools, the kids, the blue-collar workers, it's almost a repellent. Almost every action in his career and of his party now, and virtually everything that Democrat Party wants today, represents an attack on the middle class -- traditional American families, working Americans.Team Biden will ship your jobs to china and lock you in your homes. They'd shut down churches and schools, they'd let rioters loot and burn, they'd punish the police and free the criminals. This November pay no attention to empty Democrat promises about all the free stuff they're finally going to give you. I've been listening to those promises my whole life. If they had any meaning, we'd all be on Easy Street by now.Remember the jobs we lost to China, the storefronts destroyed by the riots, the cops threatened and humiliated by Left Wing nuts, the kids who still can't go to school. That's the real Democratic Party, and they're coming for you. And that's \"The Angle.\"Joining me now is Larry Kudlow, White House economic adviser. Larry, good to see you tonight. If Biden was serious about empowering American workers, he did the big populist push today. Why didn't he actually do that during his 40 plus years in DC?LARRY KUDLOW, NATIONAL ECONOMIC COUNCIL DIRECTOR: Well, it's good point. He had his chance, particularly with Obama, last eight years before President Trump. We had one of the worst recoveries in history.Look, you go down the list and look at that campaign document, first of all, he intends to repeal every tax cut that President Trump put in to rejuvenate the economy. And let me make this point, despite the mantra of the Democrats that all tax cuts help the rich.The Trump tax cuts did exactly what we hoped. That is, middle income, blue collar workers, lower wage earners performed the best, not only with the lowest unemployment rate in history, but their wage increase was faster than the top 1 percent. And the unemployment rates for African Americans and Hispanics and Asians and women were at historic lows.Plus, Biden's going to add new taxes, today he said by the way. He does want to have the stock market. He doesn't want to have shareholders involved in the stock market. Well, besides pension funds, and even union pension funds 51 percent are invested in the stock market, which I might add is up 40 percent since the laws.He's going to rewrite all of the regulatory reductions that President Trump put in to help small businesses --INGRAHAM: Oh, it's going to be a nightmare.KUDLOW: --to hire workers.INGRAHAM: Nightmare.KUDLOW: He's for the Green New Deal, which will -- and he can talk about coal mines all he wants. But if you go with the Green New Deal, that means all fossil fuels gone.INGRAHAM: Well, it's Biden energy sector.KUDLOW: It will have an incredibly negative effect on the economy.INGRAHAM: Larry, let me get in here. Let me get in here, because I think what Biden sees, obviously, he's had a disadvantage in arguing these points. It's obvious. His whole career speaks to internationalism and exporting jobs to china.But he also can say now, because you all have and done it, I'm going to bring back drug manufacturing. I'm going to do this. Trump says he was going to do it from China. I'm going to do it. Why hasn't the Trump administration moved on that order? I know Peter Navarro and others have been pushing. It was reported today. Why are we not bringing back some of these drugs and bringing them back stat, to use a medical term.KUDLOW: Well, but that's exactly what we're trying to do. Not only pharmaceuticals, but semiconductors --INGRAHAM: Well, what's holding it up?KUDLOW: --retailers. Well, there's nothing holding it up. We are -- when we come out with our program, we're already in discussion with lots of companies based in China. We had a discussion today. A leading semiconductor company is selling their factories in China and coming back home. We will give them the lowest corporate tax rates, we will give them perhaps tax credits, certainly 100 percent expensing. We may use some government funds to pay for their moving costs.We have a whole campaign planned. We're warning American investors not to invest in Chinese stocks because of the fraudulent accounting. Robert O'Brien and I have already warned, the Thrift Savings Plan and the Railroad Retirement Fund. So we are doing exactly that. And we're taking steps to deal with this Hong Kong disaster. So I don't think it's right to say we haven't done it. We've been doing it.And the tax reform itself, we made it so easy to repatriate profits and capital come back to the United States. In a second Trump term, you'll see a lot more of that.INGRAHAM: And so we -- you can commit tonight that we will bring back these crucial drugs and the manufacturing, even if the price goes up a little bit at home, in order to secure our stockpile of critical medications?KUDLOW: I think, Laura, that we learned -- not the only country, other countries. But United States learned that China is not to be trusted, period, full stop. And that we cannot rely on these long-complicated supply chains coming out of China. I think you'll see the whole business community.You don't see business school professors saying now the supply chains don't work. We got to bring it back home, because China is not reliable. They're not the only ones who are unreliable. But I hear the same thing for people around the world, so that's going to be a major change.But we have got to continue low taxes and deregulation and fair-trade deals. If we do that, we will come through this pandemic, I think we're going to get 20 percent growth in the second half. Hopefully, the virus hotspots will be subdued and mitigated, and I think we're going to have a big bang in 2021.We were coming into this strong, you know that. The tax cuts worked, deregulation worked, the energy worked, the trade worked.INGRAHAM: In real short --KUDLOW: We just had the USMCA. We just had the USMCA. President Obrador was here. A lot of goodwill. That's(CROSSTALK)INGRAHAM: Larry, real quick --KUDLOW: --percentage points to GDP.INGRAHAM: Real quick. Isn't it really important that people understand, comparing our response to COVID to Europe's response, our economy is faring far better than the major European countries. I don't think a lot of voters know that. But when you look at the charts, it's undeniable. Trump's policies, post COVID are working economically. Biden wants to turn that back by locking us all down as do those Democrat mayors. Real quick, Larry.KUDLOW: Well, we -- look, we have a strong V shaped recovery. There's some recovery in Europe, by the way, but we do have a strong recovery. Let me just say this in closing.I am concerned about the virus hotspots -- and I will say this. If you want to reopen our economy, if you want to let the President rebuild our economy for the second time, the best thing we can do is take the safety measures, use the face mask. The President said that tonight with Sean. Keep the distancing. The testing is so important in the hotspots and personal hygiene. If you practice that, then we will stabilize the hotspots and we will be off to the races in a strong economy. That's where we started, and it can continue.INGRAHAM: Larry great to see it. Tonight, thanks so much for joining us.And American cities are already getting a preview of what life will be like under the Biden administration. Angry mobs burning down businesses, defacing monuments. Of course, we see the rampant crime, and all-out assault on police by the people who are supposed to be leading the people and keeping them safe. It'll only get worse if Biden wins.Joining me now Bernie Kerik, former NYPD Commissioner. Bernie, you've heard me in \"The Angle.\" No cash bail, no prison for not paying child support. I don't need to repeat the whole thing. This is what Biden's plan is. What will that mean for Americans streets, neighborhoods, communities?BERNARD KERIK, FORMER NYPD COMMISSIONER: Chaos. Chaos, violent crime, murder. We already know in every one of the Democratic cities around the country. The major cities like Chicago and Baltimore and Milwaukee, Minnesota, places like that. They're already the highest crime -- the highest violent crime, the highest murder rates. It's only going to get worse.This diminishing, defunding the police departments is going to create mass chaos. We're seeing it right here with the reductions that this mayor has already started on reducing the street crime units, the plainclothes units.INGRAHAM: Well, the NYPD, Bernie, is seeing this disturbing mass exodus. \"National Review\" said that 179 cops filed for retirement between June 29th and Monday, a 411 percent increase over the 35 who filed during the same period last year. So this is exactly what the Black Lives Matter and the radical left want to see happen, right? Drive police out of the streets, drive police off the force and demoralize the population, so they just say, OK, I'll vote for Biden to make it stop, I guess.KERIK: And that's what the mayor did today. By standing on Fifth Avenue, drawing that mural for Black Lives Matter, knowing that this is a trained Marxist group, that they were inspired by a domestic terrorists convicted of killing a cop, that they've called for the murders of cops, that they've yelled and chant, \"pigs in a blanket, fry like bacon,\" \"the only good cops are dead cops.\"They're responsible for all the riots in 44 states, 76 cities around the country that injured 500 cops. He's out there painting that mural. You know what that says to every New York City cop? I despise you. I despise you.And he himself -- and I got to remind people of this. He is no better than the founders of Black Lives Matter, the Marxist. He himself is a Marxist. If you go back to 1987 when he was 26 years old. He was the guy standing out there saying Nicaragua's troubles are my troubles too, supporting the Sandinistas. He's a lunatic. He should not be in office.INGRAHAM: Well, New York -- I mean, will New York ever wake up or is this the city they want? Because everyone I know is leaving New York. Bernie. It's a complete disgrace. Thank you for your words of wisdom tonight.And the media was downright giddy about the Supreme Court's ruling on Trump's tax returns. But they were wrong. They shouldn't be. Our legal Eagles will explain why this actually might be a huge political victory for Trump. You bet. Stay there.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)ARI MELBER, MSNBC CHIEF LEGAL CORRESPONDENT: A big loss for President Trump here.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I find this to be a very dark day for Donald Trump. This is his greatest fear.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: If he doesn't win reelection, he is potentially going to see a criminal indictment as a private person.NEAL KATYAL, FORMER FEDERAL PROSECUTOR: I'm Donald Trump. I am scared right now.(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM: It's scary that the guy was the Solicitor General of the United States. Well, the truth is that one of the rulings today completely destroyed Congress's gross unconstitutional overstep in trying to obtain Trump's tax returns.So yes, the High Court did rule that the Manhattan D.A. Cyrus Vance could subpoena the tax documents. But it's not the stirring victory the Left would have you believe. You actually have to read the opinions.Now, first, the case was remanded back to the lower court, where Trump's lawyers can make more constitutional arguments to draw up the case. And second, even if a court expedites its decision, the tax returns would go to a grand jury, meaning they'll still be secret.Now, in fact, the Manhattan D.A. may not see the President's tax returns for many more months or many more years. This is just harassment, come on. In other words, there's almost zero chance that Trump's taxes become public before the November election.Joining me now is John Eastman, Claremont Institute Senior Fellow, Constitutional Scholar; also Sol Wisenberg, former deputy independent counsel. So you say this isn't really the win that Vance in New York thinks it is, why?SOL WISENBERG, DEP WHITEWATER INDEPENDENT COUNSEL: Well, even though President Trump and the DOJ lost on their overall legal argument. Remember, all the court said was that the President does not have absolute immunity from state criminal processes.But that's kind of a theoretical question, Laura, they then send it back to the lower courts, as you say, and President Trump is free to say all right. But in this particular instance, this subpoena is a problem. This subpoena, for example, is nothing but a retaliatory effort to interfere with my executive powers.They're still free to make any argument they want with respect to the particular subpoena. Why was it issued at this particular time? Why do you want my -- why exactly do you need these tax returns? So, yes, they lost on their legal points, which I don't think most people thought they were going to win on anyway. But as a practical matter, I think it's a win, certainly in the short term.INGRAHAM: John, your thoughts on this. This seems like this opens the door in a way for any rogue, State AG or DA to harass the President of the United States anytime they have an ideological dispute, not to impart bad motives on all Democrat DAs. But it certainly opens up a can of worms down the road for other Presidents, perhaps.JOHN EASTMAN, CLAREMONT INSTITUTE SENIOR FELLOW: Well, it does open it up perhaps. But I agree with Sol, and that's not what -- I mean, I was watching the news today and wondered whether the news reports were reading the same opinion I was reading. I mean, I think the Chief Justice, and the and the large majority of the court went out of its way to try and prevent that kind of rogue district attorney from harassing the President.He said the entire the entire conduct of the proceeding needs to be conducted with the fact that this is the President of United States and the Office of Chief Executive in mind. And it specifically says that the President can challenge these subpoenas as an attempt to influence the performance of his duties that would violate the supremacy clause.And so, you don't have absolute immunity from the subpoena, but we're not going to allow witch hunts for partisan political gain against a sitting president or a presidential candidate. And I think the court made clear on that.So I don't think this is a win for Vance at all. The Second Circuit decision was affirmed, and that just means the president doesn't have absolute immunity, but the things that are handed to him are more than enough to force him having to disclose.INGRAHAM: Got it. Sol, I want to move on to John Durham, because there's so many people waiting for the results of his investigation, but FOX News is reporting exclusively that Durham does not want this to be viewed politically, and the closer it gets to November, Durham could punt it until after the election. Sol, if this report is delayed until after election, it's never going to the light of day, we might not ever know what was really down to the president or what nefarious efforts were undertaken at the FBI and beyond.WISENBERG: First of all, we don't know that there's going to be a report. He's not a report, he's not a special counsel. He may just tell the story in any indictments that get issued. I would also say there's a considerable amount of time between an election if the president loses and the following term.But listen, I have a lot of faith in Durham. He's got a sterling reputation. And as Attorney General Barr said -- first of all, Attorney General Barr said he doesn't think there is even going to be in an investigation, a criminal investigation of former President Obama or President Biden. If you take those two out of the equation, as Barr said, who are we going to be looking that is going to be running for office? Nobody. So I don't really -- I'll believe it when I see it. I think Durham is being methodical. He doesn't want anyone to say that this is political on his part, and given his reputation, I don't think they will.INGRAHAM: John, really quickly, your reaction to the shocking decision by Federal District Judge Emmet Sullivan to refuse to dismiss the case against Flynn. He is now asking the appeals court en banc to rule about whether to keep the Flynn case alive. John, real quick.EASTMAN: Did he not get the basic separation of powers thing? He doesn't get to bring motions to another court. He's not the party in the case. He doesn't get to appoint his own prosecutor. He is supposed to be the judge. This is just getting laughable. But I hope the en banc circuit, D.C. circuit will slap it down, and slap the judge down too, rather than just the case.INGRAHAM: If you can sanction the judge in this case, I would be all for that. This is a travesty. We've got to roll. Guys, thanks so much.And despite the fact that college aged students are extremely low risk as the task force said yesterday, various leagues now have already started canceling their sports in the fall. Legendary former Notre Dame coach Lou Holtz is here next. Why canceling football is not just ignoring science but could actually crush the American spirit. Stay there.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)INGRAHAM: I was thinking about this today, what we are in the middle of here, it kind of amounts to a war against our way of life. Because after the riots subsided and it became clear that the U.S. economy was improving, and improving really rapidly under President Trump's policies, I think the left and started to freak out a little bit. Can't have all those people working at having fun again. So how could they keep the panic and anxiety going to ensure a Biden victory?(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Dr. Fauci says the United States is knee-deep in the crisis.DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES: I think any state that is having a serious problem, that state should seriously look at shutting down.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Look how steep that curve is, and you think the only way now to change that is to shut down?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We're not dropping cases in our immunity with tests and trace and masking, then yes.(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM: Deaths are going down, cases are going up, so no fun for America.OK, now, a few states of course have seen the rise in positive cases, but again, the daily death rate has been dropping like a rock since peaking in April. This is actually good news. We're getting closer to herd immunity in some sectors of the United States. We also have T cell immunity, talked about that the other night. So it's a serious disease, especially, though, for the old and vulnerable. Most people do quite well with it under the age of 25, most people will be fine, again, with some rare exceptions. Kids who are college aged and younger, what about them?(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DR. DEBORAH BIRX, WHITE HOUSE CORONAVIRUS RESPONSE COORDINATOR: We know that mortality rate in under 25 from the CDC data is less than 0.1 percent.We have no evidence that there is significant mortality in children without coexisting diseases.(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM: So despite this extremely low risk for young people with COVID, colleges around the country seem to be rushing into the fearmongering stage, the panic stage. And the left seems to enjoy this moment where sports seems to be ending.Now yesterday, the Ivy League announced it would cancel all sports in the fall, including football. Just how big a deal is this? Yale won't be playing Princeton or Harvard for the first time since World War II. As expected, the dominoes continue to fall. From there, the Big Ten said today it wouldn't allow any out of conference games for football or any other sport, citing these unprecedented times. But at the end of the day, the commissioner couldn't even promise that.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)KEVIN WARREN, BIG TEN COMMISSIONER: One thing we have to realize is that this is not a fait accompli that we're going to have sports in the fall. We may not have sports in the fall. We may not have a college football season in the Big Ten.(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM: Well, this mindset isn't just taking over colleges, it's trickling down the high schools well. Superintendent of Dallas public schools, have some good football teams there, made this stunning announcement today.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MICHAEL HINOJOSA, DALLAS INDEPENDENT SCHOOL DISTRICT SUPERINTENDENT: I seriously doubt it. I don't know. We're not in control of that. The university interscholastically gives us guidance on that. But that's a true contact sport. I don't know how we can pull it off. There's been some discussion of moving it to the spring, but we'll have to wait and see. I seriously doubt we can pull it off.(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM: Because there is no inherent risk in playing football. The kids don't out there and put their health at risk just playing the sport. Specifically, one of the greatest coaches of all time is Lou Holtz, Notre Dame Hall of Fame coach. Lou, I'm so glad you're here tonight. I say this kind of feels like a war on American life. No church, no singing, no school, no football. Where does it end?LOU HOLTZ, FOOTBALL ANALYST: I think it ends when we have the election. When you're in a leadership role, Laura, you have to look at things from both points of view. As a coach I'd look at it from a player's point of view as well as from a coach's point of view. The way it is right now, they just don't want to have sports, and there's no way in this world you can do anything in this world without a risk. People stormed Normandy. I took some grandchildren over there. They knew there was going to be casualties, they knew there was going to be risk, but it was a way of life.Now if you eliminate all nonconference games, first of all, you have seven teams in the Big Ten that schedule four patsies so they know they're going to win four games, with two conference games, they can go to the bowl. That ain't going to happen. But let me tell you the devastating effect it's going to have is then the nonpower five schools, my son is head coach at Louisiana Tech. He used to play Baylor, Vanderbilt, those are money games, those are very, very important. But how are you going to have football when they don't even want to have school? Some schools like Notre Dame has said, OK, we're going to start on August 10th. Now some of faculty members say, oh, it's too risky, I don't want to go. You have teachers' unions saying you shouldn't go back to school. The underprivileged, the people from the poor neighborhoods, where they going to get education? What has happened to our way of life? Look at it from both points of view. The risk is always there, but you cannot just look at it from one side, and that's exactly what's happening. And I think it will end on Election Day.INGRAHAM: Lou, it seems to me that there are a lot of people on the left especially who have wanted to get rid of football for some time. All the op-eds about, of course it's a dangerous sport, it's a brutal sport, it's a misogynistic sport. Football has been trashed by the left for a couple of decades. So you get the sense that they think they have football right where they want it. But Notre Dame, Alabama, even some of those Ivy League schools, the Pac 10, Ohio, the Buckeyes, they all want to play football. When are we going to hear from coaches and players who say let us assume the risk? We'll assume the risk, let our players play. Are we going to hear from any of them or no?HOLTZ: I don't think so, but if I were coaching I would sure speak up. I've had people say I don't want my son to play football so I'm going to go buy him a motorcycle so he'll have something to do other than football.I want to tell you, Laura. I can't begin to tell you the lessons people learn in football. It's a microcosm of life. You learn about sacrifice, you learn about teamwork, getting along with other people. You learn to work on your skills to make sacrifices, to make a total commitment to other people for the welfare of the overall team and unit. There is so many valuable lessons you learn from it, and when you are part of a team, people want to be part of something. That is how games came about. When they started emphasizing athletics in schools, then people started enjoying the game, because young people wanted to be part of something, and you are that away from them?INGRAHAM: Coach, I want to quickly get to your view on the now push to get Notre Dame to reconsider the Fighting Irish nickname. OK, as a former coach at Notre Dame, what are your thoughts on that? Apparently, that is now politically incorrect.HOLTZ: I think that's ridiculous. They were named the Fighting Irish because the Ku Klux Klan tried to attack the Catholics. They went down and fought the Ku Klux Klan, and that is where the name the Fighting Irish came. Now day you're going to tell me they want to topple my statue Notre Dame. That is when I will really get mad.INGRAHAM: Coach Holtz, before we go, on behalf of all of us at \"The Ingraham Angle,\" I want to express our great condolences for your incredible wife, the lovely Beth. I know you were married for 58 years. She was an amazing woman, and I know it just hurts in your heart, and we heard for you, coach.HOLTZ: Thank you, Laura. If I could make one comment, we had the funeral at Notre Dame Basilica, there couldn't be many people, but we have gotten so many thousands of texts and emails. I wish they had done it when she was alive. So everybody listen, please sit down while somebody's still living and tell them the difference they made in your life. Do it while they can appreciate it. Thank you.INGRAHAM: Lou, we will, and you have made a huge difference to so many players and alumni and students and me, personally, over the years. So thank you so much for everything you do. We really appreciate it.HOLTZ: Thank you. Now I have to watch your program alone. And I enjoy your program, but it will be sad.INGRAHAM: Thanks so much, Lou.HOLTZ: Thank you.INGRAHAM: And being a medical professional who tells the truth about COVID figures gets you smeared professionally, ostracized, even targeted by medical boards. Two men who found themselves in that position at times are here with their stories, next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)INGRAHAM: For challenging the medical establishment, may be the medical deep state, and exposing a massive flaw in our COVID response, my next two guests have found themselves on the wrong side of that medical mafia. Here now is Dr. Scott Jensen, physician, Minnesota state senator, and Dr. Stephen Smith, founder of the Smith Center for Infectious Diseases and Urban Health. Dr. Jensen, you found legitimate flaws in the CDC's guidelines. Now you're being targeted by your state's health board. Explain briefly.DR. SCOTT JENSEN, PHYSICIAN: Basically, I'm being told that because I questioned the Department of Health and the CDC's communications that I've been spreading misinformation. I think this is ludicrous. If you want to know who is spreading misinformation, if the governor comes out and tells Minnesotans they are going to have 74,000 deaths and then later on reduces it to 29,000 deaths, and then later on gives us another statistic and says in mid-July, which is next week, we're going to have 1,000 deaths per day, to me that would be more misinformation than me saying hey, listen, death certificates are a serious thing and we should be doing it right.INGRAHAM: Dr. Smith, you've turned into a pariah of sorts by your own hospital because of your advocacy for and use of, successfully, I might add, hydroxychloroquine. Tell us about it.DR. STEPHEN SMITH, SMITH CENTER OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES: In the beginning when I adopted the French regimen, which was 600 milligrams a day, as opposed to the 2,400 milligrams lower dose that people were using, CDC, actually the FDA eventually endorsed, I got immediate pushback from the CMO at one of the hospitals we go to. Immediate. Like, we'll take it from here, Stephen, after I sent them the article. I said, what? He came in on a Saturday and I was still in the hospital working my tail off, and I said, no, you won't touch my patients.And since then, I don't know why -- I didn't know I was creating controversy. I thought I was following the data like I always do. And it's a safe drug, a cheap drug. And I got in another argument with the CMO of the system. He said, if we give everybody 600 milligrams a day, which is only 6,000, as opposed to 2,400 milligrams, we're going to run out of hydroxychloroquine. I said I don't believe him. He hung up on me. That was after maybe I had spent three hours taking care of 50 of his patients.INGRAHAM: Earlier today, earlier today Dr. Fauci was asked if we can control COVID without a vaccine. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES: I think we can get it under control but keeping it under control is going to be the real problem. This virus, to our dismay, is spectacularly efficient in transmitting from person to person. That makes me skeptical whether we would get permanent, sustained control of this without having a vaccine.(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM: OK, Dr. Jensen. The translation -- get ready to be locked down until Biden is elected. I'm sorry, I hear that, and my blood boils. It is a virus, it's a bad virus, but most people do fine with it. Could this be with us forever? And vaccines aren't 100 percent useful anyway, in most cases.JENSEN: I would ask Dr. Fauci why in the world he would use the word \"spectacularly.\" That sounds like just fearmongering. And I would ask, what RNA viruses have we been successful at in terms of creating a vaccine that really does what we want? We know that with our influenza vaccine, we frequently face just terribly mediocre results. And if you look at other coronavirus viruses, whether you're talking about SARS or MERS, we don't have a great track record. So the fact of the matter is, if a vaccine comes along to help us, that's great, but we are far more realistically leaning into herd immunity.INGRAHAM: Yes, the Henry Ford Health System study on hydroxy has come under fire. Not only was the study not randomized, outside experts noting the patients who received hydroxy were also more likely to get steroids. Dr. Smith, you've read the study, you've treated all these patients successfully. What are your thoughts?SMITH: It's really hard to -- actually it's harder to show something works than doesn't work. And obviously we've had several trials showing this drug or drug combination works very well. Our data support that. There are many other trials that show that. And when you see efficacy, you really take notice, because, again, it's harder to prove something works in this situation then to say it's neutral. It's a lot easier to say he doesn't have an effect for a bunch of reasons.INGRAHAM: And it's a generic drug and it doesn't cause $4,000 a course like remdesivir. Gentlemen, thank you so much. Great to see you.An important Last Bite, next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BAIER: A policy of never-ending lockdowns month after month would ultimately do more harm than good to public health, and so bad for our children. As a result, it really is more loss of life. We can't do that. We have to get back now. We did it right. We saved millions of lives by what we did.(END VIDEO CLIP)", "comment": "", "topic": "TRANSCRIPT", "date": " July 9"}, {"cover": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/07/156/88/DURUM-UP-CLOSE.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "title": "Virginia, Utah residents report receiving unsolicited packets of seeds in the mail reportedly from China", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/us/virginia-utah-unsolicited-seeds-china", "subtitle": "Virginia residents have been advised not to plant any unsolicited seeds they may have received in the mail, the state\u2019s Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services has advised.", "keyword": "China and national Security", "website": "Fox News", "author": "Peter Aitken", "content": " residents have been advised not to plant any unsolicited  they may have received in the mail, the state\u2019s Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services (VADACS) has advised.

Michigan began the year with expectations that it would be one of the most intense battlegrounds in the country, but its share of Trump television advertising dollars dwindled this summer as\u00a0built a steady advantage in the polls. Since the end of June, Mr. Trump has spent more money on ads in 10 other states \u2014 with Michigan falling behind even much smaller states like Iowa and Nevada \u2014 and in recent days, Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign stopped buying ads in Michigan entirely. The Biden campaign has more than tripled what Mr. Trump spent on television in Michigan in the last month, by far the most lopsided advantage of any swing state where both are advertising.\u201d\u00a0: \u201cPresident Donald Trump is headed to Odessa and Midland today for his 16th visit to Texas during his presidency. Trump is set to land in Midland at 11:30 a.m. before going to Odessa for a fundraising event at the Marriott. The president will later tour an oil rig at Double Eagle Energy in Midland and talk about his energy policies. The president's visit just a couple months before early voting begins highlights how Texas might see a closer presidential race than it has in decades. Three public polls show Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden in a dead heat, the Houston Chronicle reports. Before this, Texas was a reliable source of votes for Republicans.\u2026 Biden criticized Trump's visit as the state reels from the coronavirus and Hurricane Hanna, the Houston Chronicle reports. \u2018Mr. Trump, now isn\u2019t the time for politicking or photo-ops,\u2019 Biden said Wednesday morning.\u201d:\u00a0\u201cDonald Trump and Joe Biden are engaged in a tight race for Georgia\u2019s electoral votes according to the Monmouth University Poll. \u2026 Among all registered voters in Georgia, Trump is supported by 47% and Biden is supported by 47%, with 3% saying they will vote for Libertarian\u00a0\u00a0and 3% who are undecided. These results include 42% who are certain to vote for Trump and 39% who say the same for Biden. At the other end of the spectrum, 45% say they are not at all likely to vote for the incumbent and 44% say the same for challenger. \u2026\u00a0Overall, 46% of Georgia voters have a favorable opinion of Trump and 45% have an unfavorable one \u2013 including 38% very unfavorable. Biden gets a 41% favorable and 46% unfavorable rating, including 34% very unfavorable.\u201d: \u201cFormer Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee, was captured Tuesday holding a note with Sen.\u00a0' name printed across the top with talking points, including, \u2018Do not hold grudges.\u2019 The other talking points about Harris were: \u2018Campaigned with me & Jill.\u2019 \u2018Talented.\u2019 \u2018Great help to campaign.\u2019 \u2018Great respect for her.\u2019 Harris, D-Calif., was a Biden rival when she was running her own campaign for president but has since emerged as a top contender for the vice presidency. The does \u2018not hold grudges\u2019 talking point may be reference to the clash between the two at the first Democratic debate, when the former California attorney general went after Biden, who was considered the front-runner for most of 2019, on his civil rights record. \u2026 According to POLITICO, former Sen.\u00a0, who is a member of Biden\u2019s vice presidential search committee, was stunned by Harris' attack, reportedly saying, \u2018She laughed and said, \u2018that\u2019s politics.\u2019 She had no remorse.\u2019 Those comments have drawn criticism, especially from Democratic women, who say Harris is being held to a standard that wouldn\u2019t apply to a man.\u201d\u00a0: \u201cJoe Biden said Tuesday he would have his choice for a vice presidential running mate the first week of August. \u2018I\u2019m going to have a choice the first week in August and I promise I\u2019ll let you know when I do,\u2019 the Democratic presidential nominee told reporters after delivering a speech about the racial-equity part of his economic plan. Biden had previously pushed back his deadline for a decision from Aug. 1 to a bit later in the month. The Democratic National Convention starts on Aug. 17 and he is almost certain to announce his choice before that. The former vice president has pledged to choose a woman running mate. Last week he said that the group of candidates he was still considering included four Black women, among others.\u201d\u00a0: \u201c[A Monmouth University poll] showed close races in Georgia\u2019s two U.S. Senate contests. Republican U.S. Sen.\u00a0\u00a0held a 49-43 lead over Democrat\u00a0. \u2026 In Georgia\u2019s other U.S. Senate race, the free-for-all special election for U.S. Sen.\u00a0\u2019s seat, showed the Republican incumbent with a narrow advantage. Loeffler led the pack with 26% of support, followed by fellow Republican U.S. Rep.\u00a0\u00a0at 20%.\u00a0\u00a0was the top Democrat with 14% of the vote, trailed by\u00a0\u00a0at 9% and\u00a0\u00a0at 5%. \u2026 Another 18% of voters are undecided. That contest will feature 21 candidates all on the same ballot with no primary to filter out nominees. If no candidate gets a majority of the vote \u2013 a highly likely scenario \u2013 the two top finishers head to a January runoff.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0: \u201cA slew of dismal summer polls and a persistent fundraising gap have left some Republicans fretting about a nightmare scenario in November: That they will fall further into the House minority. Publicly, House GOP leaders are declaring they can still net the 17 seats needed to flip the chamber. But privately, some party strategists concede it\u2019s a much grimmer picture, with as many as 20 Republican seats at risk of falling into Democratic hands. Far from going on offense, the GOP could be forced to retrench in order to limit its losses. There's a growing fear that President Donald Trump\u2019s plummeting popularity in the suburbs could threaten GOP candidates in traditionally favorable districts, and that their party's eagerness to go on offense might leave some underfunded incumbents and open GOP-held seats unprotected. Internal Democratic surveys in recent weeks have shown tight races in once-solid GOP seats in Indiana, Texas, Michigan, Ohio and Montana that Trump carried handily 2016 \u2014 data that suggest the battleground is veering in a dangerous direction for the GOP.\u201d: \u201cTwo years ago, the notion of running a progressive\u00a0\u00a0supporter in a Trump district in Texas would have been seen as political suicide. Now,\u00a0, a school-board member who talks about her path from homelessness to the pinnacle of local politics, is considered one of the Democrats\u2019 top House recruits in the country. In the primary, she defeated a retired Air Force colonel, the type of candidate who would typically be seen as better-positioned to win over moderate swing voters. Meanwhile, the biggest-name Democratic congressional hopeful in Texas is former gubernatorial candidate\u00a0. Davis, whose abortion-rights activism backfired in the conservative-minded red state during her 2014 race, is suddenly looking like a viable candidate in the reliably Republican 21st District, which is even more Trump-friendly than the state at large.\u201d\u00a0:\u201cSo much for Southern hospitality. This fall, Tennessee will say goodbye to retiring Sen.\u00a0, one of the last of the genteel Republican moderates in the chamber. And the race to replace him has turned into perhaps the ugliest Republican primary in the country \u2014 with spurious super PAC attacks,\u00a0\u00a0being invoked as a slur and President Donald Trump lining up on opposite sides as Sen.\u00a0. The race was never supposed to be competitive: The Trump-backed candidate,\u00a0\u00a0\u2014 who served as the president\u2019s ambassador to Japan \u2014 was on a glide path. Trump endorsed Hagerty before he even left Tokyo or entered the race. But as the contest has tightened in the run-up to the Aug. 6 election, Hagerty's main opponent,\u00a0, has found traction by claiming to be the true, unapologetic Trumpian conservative in the race \u2014 while blasting Hagerty as a squishy, Mitt Romney-loving phony.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0: \u201cDemocrats on Tuesday notched two victories in lawsuits aimed at making it easier to vote by mail during the pandemic. The state of Rhode Island agreed to eliminate witness or notary requirements for people voting by mail throughout the 2020 elections due to the Covid-19 pandemic. A judge signed off on the agreement Tuesday. The case was brought on behalf of two voting rights advocacy groups -- the League of Women Voters of Rhode Island and Common Cause Rhode Island\u2026 Also on Tuesday, a judge in Minnesota blocked election officials from enforcing a state law that prohibited voters from helping more than three other people to cast absentee ballots, handing a significant win to two national Democratic organizations that sued to end the provisions.\u201d: \u201cThe Lincoln Project, a group founded by \"never Trump\" Republicans that has produced some of the cycle's most memorable ads, today begins spending $4 million to blitz Senate races in Alaska, Maine and Montana. This is the Lincoln Project's biggest buy to date, and the Senate ads will air for seven to 10 days in key markets. The ads \u2014 which include \u2018Real\u2019 in Alaska and \u2018Strong\u2019 in Montana \u2014 support challengers to incumbent Republicans. \u2018Trump Stooge,\u2019 airing in Maine, criticizes Sen.

The problem is not just that very few voters cast their ballots for tactical reasons. It\u2019s that it\u2019s not at all clear that the Republican Party can be burned down or Trumpism extinguished. Let\u2019s say that the November elections lead to Republicans losing the White House, 20 House seats, 12 Senate seats and five governorships: a result considerably worse for the Republicans than most observers expect. That would leave them with roughly the same amount of power they had in 2009, after\u00a0\u2019s disastrous second term. Eight years later, they had a majority of everything. Or think back to the aftermath of Watergate. Four years after\u00a0left office, they had the White House again and their first Senate majority in decades. Parties can bounce back quickly, even after defeats that look epochal.\u201d\u00a0: \u201cFederal officers will start pulling out of Portland on Thursday in a phased withdrawal and state troopers will arrive instead to help safeguard the federal courthouse downtown that has become a national symbol of political conflict as well as a focal point for protests calling for consequential police reform. Gov.\u00a0\u00a0made the announcement in a statement Wednesday and described the federal officers \u2018an occupying force\u2019 that has \u2018refused accountability and brought strife to our community.\u2019 Acting Homeland Security Secretary\u00a0, in a separate announcement, said he had been in talks with the governor in the last day and agreed to a \u2018joint plan to end the violent activity in Portland directed at federal properties and law enforcement.\u2019 But he tempered the statement by saying the \u2018augmented\u2019 federal force would remain in Portland \u2018until the violent activity toward our facility ends. We are not removing any law enforcement while our facilities and law enforcement remain under attack.\u2019\u201d: \u201cTuesday marked the 62nd consecutive night demonstrations continued in downtown Portland in the wake of George Floyd\u2019s death in police custody in Minneapolis. Portland police officers clashed with demonstrators before federal agents arrived to protect the\u00a0\u00a0U.S. Courthouse, Multnomah County Justice Center, and other government buildings the July 4 weekend. Crowds -- ranging from hundreds to thousands of people -- have tried almost every night to tear down a fence erected to protect the courthouse. They\u2019ve set fires and hurled fireworks, Molotov cocktails, and bricks, rocks, and bottles at the agents inside. Authorities this week reinforced the fence by putting concrete highway barriers around it. Federal officers often respond by firing tear gas, pepper balls, and impact munitions.\u201d\u00a0: \u201cThe Pentagon is proceeding with President Donald Trump's plan to move 12,000 U.S. troops out of Germany \u2013 about 6,400 forces will be brought home and 5,400 shifted to other countries in Europe, U.S. defense officials said Wednesday. The move will cost billions of dollars and take years to complete. It has attracted bipartisan congressional opposition, raised concerns among NATO allies and appears to be fueled at least in part by Trump\u2019s displeasure at Germany's failure to spend more on defense. The Pentagon said the action was part of its plan to strategically \u2018reposition\u2019 U.S. forces in Europe to better counter threats from Russia and China. \u2026 \u2018They take advantage of us on trade, and they take advantage of us on the military,\u2019 Trump said of Germany on Wednesday, speaking to White House reporters. \u2018So we're reducing the force because they\u2019re not paying their bills. It's very simple. They\u2019re delinquent,\u2019 Trump added, before heading to Texas for a campaign event.\u201d\u00a0: \u201cPresident Trump has never confronted\u00a0\u00a0with intelligence indicating Russia paid the Taliban to kill U.S. troops, he told \u2018Axios on HBO\u2019 in an interview on Tuesday. Why it matters: Democrats have seized on the issue, and Trump's reluctance to discuss it, as evidence he\u2019s unwilling to challenge Putin even when American lives are at stake. Trump spoke with Putin on Thursday, and subsequently deflected a question about whether he\u2019d raised the alleged bounty scheme, saying on Monday: \u2018We don't talk about what we discussed, but we had plenty of discussion.\u2019 In Tuesday\u2019s interview, he was definitive: \u2018I have never discussed it with him.\u2019 Pressed on why he didn\u2019t raise the matter in Thursday\u2019s call, he said: \u2018That was a phone call to discuss other things, and frankly that\u2019s an issue that many people said was fake news.\u2019\u201d\u00a0\u00a0-\u00a0\u00a0-\u00a0\u00a0-\u00a0\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s like a giraffe and a flamingo.

But if Americans dare to support President Trump or espouse conservative viewpoints the liberal elites at Twitter disagree with, they risk being \"downranked\" or purged from the platform.This topsy-turvy political discrimination is revolting, anti-American and cannot stand in a democracy.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"Americans are tired of the double standard when it comes to Twitter's regulation of speech,\" Jordan told me via a statement on Wednesday.\"No matter how you spin it, there seems to be different rules for Conservatives and liberals on the platform.

Did Twitter ever fact check the WHO (World Health\u00a0Organization)? No, they didn't.\"Jordan warned: \"It's time for Twitter to stop the bias, and stop targeting Conservatives on their site. If not, they'll face the consequences.\"Deservedly. Twitter allows Nation of Islam leader, Louis Farrakhan on its platform despite his long history of anti-Semitism, as well as many other controversial figures and groups. Yet, it proactively targets those on the right.This week, Twitter announced its removal of QAnon, a far-right group known for spreading conspiracy theories, along with its reported 150,000 followers and/or affiliates. Yet, for the past four years, Twitter permitted Democrats, the media and blue-check-marked \"journalists\" free rein on its network to spread the \"Russia collusion\" hoax against Trump -- possibly the biggest conspiracy theory and disinformation campaign in modern history.Never mind that Congress and the U.S. Department of Justice conducted multiple investigations into the left's manufactured \"Russia collusion\" myth -- including a 22-month special counsel investigation -- which found no such evidence.Yet, Dorsey and his far-left activist employees still allow Schiff, complicit media and co-conspirators of the debunked conspiracy to remain on its platform -- no questions asked.These disgusting double standards must end.", "comment": "(69)", "topic": "OPINION", "date": " July 24"}, {"cover": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/03/156/88/James-Clyburn-AP.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "title": "House Majority Whip Clyburn compares federal agents in Portland\u00a0to Nazi Gestapo\u00a0police", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/media/james-clyburn-compares-federal-law-enforcement-nazi-gestapo", "subtitle": "House Majority Whip James\u00a0Clyburn, D-S.C., compared\u00a0federal law enforcement\u00a0in Portland\u00a0to Nazi Germany\u2019s Gestapo\u00a0police force on Monday.\u00a0", "keyword": "China and national Security", "website": "Fox News", "author": "Brian Flood", "content": "House Majority Whip , D-S.C., compared federal law enforcement\u00a0in \u00a0to Nazi Germany\u2019s Gestapo\u00a0police force on Monday.CNN\u2019s John Berman asked\u00a0Clyburn what Democrats hope to find out after calling for an investigation into\u00a0the way the federal Department of\u00a0\u00a0(DHS) has handled recent lawlessness in the city.\u00a0Portland has seen\u00a053 consecutive night of protests.Attorney Billy Williams\u00a0\u00a0after videos on social media appeared to show unlabeled officers in unmarked vehicles suddenly grab rioters off the streets, without appearing to identify themselves or read suspects their Miranda rights.\u00a0Clyburn said he believes\u00a0law enforcement should be left up to local communities, who would have access to\u00a0federal help if they wanted it\u00a0\u2013\u00a0but the current\u00a0landscape\u00a0reminds him of Nazi Germany.\u201cThat kind of activity is the activity of a police state, and this president and this attorney general seem to be doing everything they possibly can to impose Gestapo activities in local communities, and that is what I have been warning about for a long time.

Trump has championed religious minorities, including persecuted Christians in the Middle East and Uighurs in China, and gained the release of Pastor Andrew Brunson from a Turkish prison.And Trump\u2019s tough stance on Communist  signaled the most dramatic shift in Sino-American relations since Nixon\u2019s diplomatic opening to Beijing in\u00a01972.\u00a0For decades China has stolen the intellectual property of U.S. companies, engaged in illegal trade practices, and brutally denied the human rights of its people, most recently by crushing democracy in Hong Kong.\u00a0Its persecution of the underground church is notorious. As with Ronald Reagan\u2019s posture toward the Soviet Union, Trump\u2019s policy links China\u2019s rogue behavior with its brutal denial of human rights.Conservatives long ago learned that personnel is policy. Trump understands this principle, most boldly perhaps in his appointment of Mike Pompeo as Secretary of State.\u00a0Pompeo, a full-spectrum conservative with a distinguished career in the U.S. Army, Congress, and the CIA, has made it his mission to rescue America\u2019s long and cherished tradition of advocating human rights from UN bureaucrats and muddle-headed liberalism.Last year Pompeo created the Commission on Unalienable Rights, chaired by the distinguished Harvard professor Mary Ann Glendon. The commission\u2019s newly-released report issues a clarion call for placing human rights at the center of U.S. foreign policy, based on the Declaration of Independence and American tradition.The Declaration advanced the most radical idea in human history: that all human beings are endowed by God with certain inalienable rights. The sole duty of government is to safeguard those rights. These rights would later be enshrined in the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. Freedom of religion, speech, assembly, and the press are now widely recognized as foundational to civic health and prosperity, yet they remain denied in much of the world.Pompeo\u2019s commission faults the United Nations for making a mockery of human rights, allowing China, Cuba, and Libya to dominate the UN Human Rights Council.\u00a0The U.S. resigned from the UNHRC in 2018 because it did not want to\u00a0remain part of a hypocritical council. A prime example of the UNHRC's hypocrisy was displayed the following year when the council allowed Venezuela to win\u00a0a seat despite having one of the worst records on human rights in the world.Trump\u2019s critics charge that the U.S. is abdicating its leadership and retreating from the global stage.\u00a0But viewed through the prism of the Declaration and the UN\u2019s own Declaration of Universal Human Rights in 1948, the U.S. is actually providing moral clarity and leadership by example at a time when both are much needed.\u00a0 The Commission on Unalienable Rights offers a road map for foreign policy should Trump win a second term.\u00a0Too often given short shrift by the media, the Trump administration has sanctioned dictators from the mullahs in Iran to the corrupt Maduro regime in Venezuela, which holds power after a sham election, robs its citizens of basic rights, and starves them with failed economic collectivism.\u00a0The Trump Administration has promoted liberty and human rights while avoiding overweening military commitments.Could Trump, elected in no small measure because he promised to build a wall, be the instrument for bringing down the walls of oppression that rob so many of their God-given rights and potential?\u00a0 If the blueprint provided by his State Department\u2019s Commission on Unalienable Rights is any indication, his administration could do so, offering hope to those struggling to be free across the globe, while confounding its critics.

We are at risk of having an entire generation of children fall permanently behind. If that happens, our children\u2019s futures will be the biggest casualty of the COVID-19 pandemic.I\u2019ve introduced the\u00a0Reopen Our Schools Act\u00a0in  to incentivize schools to reopen for in-person learning in the fall. As outlined in the legislation, if a school\u00a0refuses to\u00a0reopen, they\u00a0must\u00a0apply for a waiver from the Department of Education\u00a0and\u00a0risk losing federal funding. My goal is to encourage schools to come up with a plan to safely reopen by Sept. 8. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos seems to agree with the premise of my bill, and President Trump has announced he\u2019s considering using his executive power to block federal funding for schools that fail to reopen.We know that remote learning isn\u2019t working. A recent study\u00a0found\u00a0students made little to no progress in their studies from the point when schools shut down. According to\u00a0new projections, children are expected to return to school in the fall with less than 70 percent\u00a0of learning gains in reading and 37-50 percent\u00a0gains in math relative to a typical school year. Compounded with the typical \u201csummer slide,\u201d where children can lose up 20 percent\u00a0of school-year gains in reading and 27 percent\u00a0of school-year gains in math, we are at risk of having some of our children start in the fall half a grade or even a whole grade behind!As I\u2019ve spoken with teachers across northeast Indiana, their personal experiences back up the data. Teachers across the country seem to echo their concerns. According to\u00a0a new USA Today/Ipsos poll, three-quarters of teachers say distance learning is causing students to fall behind. By a six to one margin, teachers say they are worried about their students, and half of teachers are \u201cvery\u201d worried.Of course, this virus, like most calamities, is disproportionately hurting the disadvantaged. Schools don\u2019t have enough computers to hand out. Even if they did, children from\u00a0rural or\u00a0less affluent families may not have internet access or a broadband network in their area \u2014 a phenomenon some call the \u201cdigital divide.\u201d The Purdue Center for Regional Development conducted a\u00a0study\u00a0in Indiana, in which 25 percent\u00a0of respondents said they rely on cellular data or satellites for internet access. EducationSuperHighway\u00a0estimates\u00a020 percent\u00a0of students nationwide don\u2019t have access to the technology they need for remote learning. In an effort to address this inequality, some schools have resorted to busing kids to and from public Wi-Fi hotspots. Solutions like this are not good enough. One mother told the\u00a0Wall Street Journal\u00a0remote learning, \u201cfailed because of a lack of imagination, and a lack of effort.\u201d It\u2019s no wonder less affluent families are much\u00a0more likely\u00a0than their affluent counterparts to send their kids back to school when they reopen.Closing our schools\u00a0hurts our children, first and foremost. But there are larger societal consequences as well. First, the obvious: If children aren\u2019t physically in school, parents that rely on in-person learning can\u2019t go to work.\u00a0More than half\u00a0of Hoosier children live in a household where both parents work, and the highest proportion of such families live in rural and suburban areas. Keeping schools closed hurts working families, and if parents can\u2019t return to work, there will be sweeping economic repercussions in our state.And as I pointed out previously, children are losing learning gains in math faster than reading. Long before the pandemic, we were already in a STEM crisis, as described by both President Obama and President Trump. Falling behind in STEM has broad societal implications, especially\u00a0implications for our national security\u00a0and our global competition with China. In 2018, the U.S.\u00a0ranked\u00a036th\u00a0out 79 geographic areas in math scores in the Programme for International Student Assessment; the top-ranked regions are four provinces in China (Beijing, Shanghai, Jiangsu and Zhejiang). China\u2019s not waiting for a vaccine to reopen. Students in Wuhan, ground zero of the coronavirus pandemic, went back to school in May. Unless we want to live in a world dominated by\u00a0a hegemonic China, we need to fix our STEM crisis, not exacerbate it by keeping our schools closed.In the competitive global economy, there will be serious consequences to allowing an entire generation of American kids to fall behind.\u00a0For their sake and for ours, we must reopen our schools.", "comment": "(127)", "topic": "OPINION", "date": " July 9"}]
