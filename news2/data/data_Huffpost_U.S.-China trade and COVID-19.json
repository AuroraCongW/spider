Steve Daines, with long-standing business ties in China, has become a hardliner toward the country almost overnight.", "content": "A number of Republican senators seeking reelection in November are posing as China hawks after careers spent encouraging, and sometimes profiting from, investments by U.S. corporations in the country.\u00a0Despite their previous stances and links, these Republicans enthusiastically have adopted the poll-tested GOP talking point of blaming the Chinese government for the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic and casting themselves, alongside President Donald Trump, as the group uniquely capable of confronting the U.S. rival.But Democrats are eager to undermine the new GOP messaging by focusing on the more dovish records these Republicans have toward China.In Montana, for instance, where GOP Sen. Steve Daines faces a tough challenge from Democratic Gov. Steve Bullock, Democrats are already spending money to cast doubt on Daines\u2019 commitment to take a tougher line with China.Before entering Congress, Daines spent years as an executive at Procter & Gamble at a time when the industrial giant was shutting down production facilities across the U.S. and expanding production in China. Daines, who lived in China for much of the 1990s, oversaw the company\u2019s efforts to infiltrate the nascent Chinese consumer market with the active collaboration of the ruling Chinese Communist Party.Daines went on to become a champion of U.S.-China relations in Congress, supporting trade agreements that increased U.S. companies\u2019 presence in the country.\u00a0The Senate Majority PAC, a Democratic super political action committee, is spending more than $1 million to air a TV ad across Montana that highlights Daines\u2019 work for Procter & Gamble.\u00a0\u201cDaines got rich while we struggle to make ends meet,\u201d the spot\u2019s narrator says. \u201cSteve Daines profits from our pain.\u201dNo proof has surfaced that Daines directly profited from, or presided over, the offshoring of U.S. jobs by Procter & Gamble. The company\u00a0did downsize its workforce in 1993, laying off 13,000 workers \u2015 4,000 of them in the U.S.\u00a0The company simultaneously began scaling up its operations in China, which Daines was heavily involved in. He lived in Guangzhou, China, from 1992 to 1997, shepherding P&G\u2019s expansion in the country.\u00a0Both Daines and the company\u00a0say that his responsibilities were limited to helping P&G penetrate the nascent Chinese consumer market, overseeing manufacturing expansion to sell household products to Chinese consumers, rather than to export them back to the U.S. At the time, P&G was building relationships with the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s neighborhood watch committees to hawk their products, a practice that other multinational corporations would subsequently emulate.As a guest earlier this month on the conservative talk radio show \u201cOpen for Business with Tom and Shane\u201d in his home state, Daines began to get annoyed when a Montanan who called in accused him of moving American factories to China.\u201cWe were producing and selling products to compete directly with the Chinese companies,\u201d Daines responded. \u201cNothing we produced there was shipped back to the United States.\u201dIn any event, the federal government recognized two specific cases during that same period when P&G replaced U.S. production with plants overseas. The Department of Labor awarded workers laid off at P&G plants in Staten Island, New York, and Hatboro, Pennsylvania, with trade adjustment assistance benefits reserved for workers who lost their jobs due to offshoring.And even if Daines was not involved in offshoring jobs to China during his tenure at P&G, his current harsh line against the country runs counter to a congressional career spent encouraging deeper trade ties between the country and the U.S.\u00a0Daines has made \u201cholding China accountable\u201d a central theme of his reelection campaign since early April. In a Facebook ad capable of reaching hundreds of thousands of people, Daines has promised to \u201cEXPOSE China\u2019s deadly cover-up of the China virus.\u201d The language closely mirrors the recommendations of the campaign arm for Senate Republicans, which advised candidates in an April memo to \u201cattack China\u201d for its alleged role in allowing the novel coronavirus to spread, and to also run on re-shoring domestic manufacturing.But as The Daily Beast reported in May, Daines stands out on Capitol Hill as a cheerleader for U.S.-China relations prior to the COVID-19 outbreak. He has been such an outspoken advocate of opening Chinese markets to Montana cattle exports that he made his fifth official trip to China last August.He also has used those trips to reassure the Chinese government that the U.S. has no plans to stop recognizing Chinese sovereignty over Taiwan. China\u2019s ambassador to the U.S. has called Daines China\u2019s \u201cambassador to Congress.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s kind of hard to have this career in the private sector and then in Congress support this free trade with China and then come out as someone who is attacking China,\u201d said David Parker, a Montana State University political scientist whose book, \u201cBattle for the Big Sky,\u201d chronicled Daines\u2019 2014 election. \u201cIt just doesn\u2019t seem to me like it\u2019s terribly believable.\u201d\u00a0A spokesperson for Daines\u2019 campaign did not respond to multiple requests for comment on whether his history of support for U.S.-China trade and diplomatic relations is inconsistent with his more hawkish tone as a candidate.Two other Republican senators facing contentious re-election battles also have histories of support for U.S. trade with China that they are now rushing to offset with hawkish positions.In 2015, GOP Sens. Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Cory Gardner of Colorado voted against both a bipartisan amendment that would have made cracking down on currency manipulation a higher priority in U.S. trade policy and a bipartisan bill vesting the Customs and Border Protection agency with greater authority to enforce trade agreement compliance. (Many economists blame China\u2019s policy of boosting the value of the U.S. dollar and suppressing the value of its own currency for artificially increasing the attractiveness of Chinese exports, thus contributing to the loss of manufacturing jobs in the U.S.)That same year, both senators also voted against a Democratic-backed bill that would have enacted tax benefits for companies that create jobs in the U.S. and levied tax penalties on companies that move U.S.-based jobs overseas. (Daines likewise did not vote for these three measures.)Now Tillis is touting his co-sponsorship of a bill incentivizing domestic production of personal protective equipment.\u00a0\u00a0Gardner remains opposed to the Trump administration\u2019s use of tariffs in trade with China, but has taken a more aggressive line toward the country, calling for the Department of Defense to encourage domestic mining of rare Earth minerals to reduce dependence on imports from there.\u00a0And One Nation, a pro-Gardner group, is airing a TV spot claiming the incumbent has a \u201clong track record of getting tough on China.\u201d\u00a0Matt Corridoni, a spokesman for the Democratic Senate Majority PAC, said, \u201cRepublicans are so desperate to claw their way out of their leadership failures on COVID-19 that they\u2019re latching onto the GOP anti-China playbook as a life raft. Their hypocrisy knows no bounds, and if voters don\u2019t reject them for that, they\u2019ll certainly reject them for playing politics while Americans suffer.\u201d\u00a0A spokesperson for Gardner\u2019s campaign did not respond to a request for comment.Tillis campaign spokesperson Andrew Romeo referred HuffPost to a host of comments from Tillis that criticized China\u2019s human rights record, characterized the country as a military threat, and called for tougher enforcement of bilateral trade rules, including safeguards on U.S. intellectual property. (Out of 15 examples that the campaign provided, however, just two date to before Trump\u2019s election in 2016 on an anti-China platform.)Tillis \u201chas been fighting to hold China accountable for years on trade, military matters, human rights and intellectual property, and has a plan to ramp up those efforts in the wake of COVID-19,\u201d Romeo said in a statement.As of now, the Daines-Bullock faceoff in Montana remains the campaign where U.S.-China relations have played the biggest role. The race has become increasingly seen as crucial in the battle for Senate control, with Bullock \u2015 a popular two-term governor \u2015 given a fighting chance to unseat Daines in a GOP-leaning state.Bullock\u2019s campaign has declined to comment on Daines\u2019 shift on U.S.-China relations, leaving that to the Senate Majority PAC and the Montana Democratic Party.\u201cDaines\u2019 new talking points are nothing more than a desperate attempt to save his political career,\u201d Christina Wilkes, a spokesperson for the state party, said in a statement. \u201cThis dishonest pivot is just further evidence that Montanans can\u2019t trust him on the issues.\u201dBullock, a short-lived 2020 presidential candidate, delighted national Democrats when he announced his plans to challenge Daines in March. Bullock won reelection as governor by 4 percentage points\u00a0in 2016 as Trump was carrying Montana by 20 points in the presidential race.)\u00a0In his role as Montana\u2019s chief executive during the coronavirus pandemic, Bullock has been an omnipresent public figure for the past few months, even as normal campaigning has slowed to a trickle. The Washington-based Cook Political Report moved the race from \u201clean Republican\u201d to a \u201ctoss-up\u201d in June.But as with virtually any bid to dislodge an incumbent, Bullock must persuade voters not only of his basic suitability, but that Daines doesn\u2019t merit another term. Undercutting Daines\u2019 self-portrayal as a China hawk could neutralize the main tool that he and other Republicans are relying on to deflect attention from Trump\u2019s mismanagement of COVID-19 and the accompanying economic fallout.\u00a0\u201cThe fact that Steve Daines is bringing up the issue of China fundamentally shows that he has some weaknesses because it\u2019s a risky gamble,\u201d Parker said."}, {"cover": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/Sj_qQZ8ked6NFq_OBF0Jbw--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5f0f56c61f0000ca0b338199.jpg", "topic": "POLITICS", "title": "Donald Trump Is At War With - Science", "author": "By Chris D'Angelo, Paul Blumenthal", "date": "July 16, 2020", "url": "https://search.huffpost.com/click/_ylt=Awr9IkrJ9SxfNlcAkmVsBmVH;_ylu=X3oDMTByNWU4cGh1BGNvbG8DZ3ExBHBvcwMxBHZ0aWQDBHNlYwNzYw--/RV=2/RE=1596810826/RO=10/RU=https%3a%2f%2fwww.huffpost.com%2fentry%2ftrump-covid-19-science-war_n_5f0f550ec5b65426947a72d4/RK=2/RS=KnJFHTKJiAkXbYOucbkAW.LJ8JQ-", "keyword": "U.S.-China trade and COVID-19", "website": "Huffpost", "subtitle": "The ongoing pandemic shows just how dangerous, and deadly, his continued rejection of science and expertise can be.", "content": "At a roundtable at Louisiana State University on Tuesday, Vice President Mike Pence paused to make what he clearly felt was a vital point.\u201cTo be very clear,\u201d he said, \u201cwe don\u2019t want CDC guidance to be a reason why people don\u2019t reopen their schools.\u201dIn other words, schools and universities, which the Trump administration is pushing to rapidly reopen despite surging coronavirus infections in many states, need not heed the advice of scientists at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the nation\u2019s premier public health agency, as they reopen amid an ongoing pandemic that has killed more than 136,000 people in the U.S.Suggesting that schools ignore expert advice meant to keep kids, parents and school staff safe would, in a different administration, be shocking. But in recent weeks, President Donald Trump and his team have led a brazen attack on COVID-19 science and scientists in a desperate effort to deny away a deadly pandemic that the administration\u2019s incompetence has made far worse. That effort has included downplaying the ongoing threat, diverting crucial hospital data from the CDC, smearing infectious disease expert Dr. Anthony Fauci, and casting blame on China, the World Health Organization and Americans from Northern states.\u00a0The COVID response is part of the Trump administration\u2019s long war on all forms of science and expertise. The administration has cast out or discredited science that does not align with Trump\u2019s fossil fuel-centric \u201cenergy dominance\u201d agenda, his reelection campaign or, in some cases, that contradicts what the president said on Twitter.The president himself has repeatedly denied climate change, questioned the science of vaccinations and invented weather forecasts for a hurricane. When hundreds of researchers from more than a dozen federal agencies warned in a November 2018 report that the world is barreling toward catastrophic climate change, Trump simply said of the findings: \u201cI don\u2019t believe it.\u201d His anti-science beliefs have been made into policy by the ex-industry lobbyists appointed to run environmental and scientific agencies across his administration.\u00a0The president on Wednesday traveled to Atlanta \u2015 a current hotspot of the virus \u2015 to speak unmasked at a UPS facility, where he announced a major rollback of one of the nation\u2019s most important environmental laws, the National Environmental Policy Act. Among other things, the rollback fast-tracks oil pipelines, power plants and other major infrastructure projects by limiting the number that require in-depth environmental reviews, as well as allowing federal agencies to ignore how developments impact climate change.\u00a0At the event, Trump thanked UPS drivers for continuing to deliver packages during America\u2019s \u201cbattle against the China virus,\u201d one of several racist terms he continues to use to describe coronavirus.While much of Trump\u2019s opposition to climate and environmental science is common among Republican presidents and lawmakers, the ongoing coronavirus pandemic shows how deadly this rejection of science can be. And his strategy heading into the 2020 election appears to be to convince Americans that the death and suffering happening around them isn\u2019t really that bad, and certainly isn\u2019t his fault.Attacking The MessengerWhile denial and finger-pointing have dominated Trump\u2019s coronavirus response from the start, the assault on reality has escalated in recent weeks. Most alarming is the administration\u2019s new effort to undermine Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and the person a majority of Americans have come to trust during the pandemic.The White House\u2019s most direct effort began on Sunday, when it distributed what looked like campaign opposition research to reporters listing Fauci\u2019s perceived misjudgments about the pandemic before the virus spread was recognized. Stories appeared noting that the Trump administration was preparing an attack on Fauci, but these attacks were all attributed to unnamed administration officials.By then, it had been more than a month since Fauci had spoken with the president, The Washington Post reported. The administration had stopped sending Fauci out for major media interviews as they were displeased that he did not endorse reopening the economy nor did he take part in Trump\u2019s happy talk that the virus will \u201cjust disappear.\u201d\u00a0\u201cDr. Fauci is a nice man, but he\u2019s made a lot of mistakes,\u201d Trump told Fox News\u2019 Sean Hannity in a July 9 interview.Fauci has continued to appear on podcasts and do interviews with online publications.\u201c[A]s a country, when you compare us to other countries, I don\u2019t think you can say we\u2019re doing great,\u201d Fauci said on a FiveThiryEight.com podcast that aired on July 9. \u201cI mean, we\u2019re just not.\u201dThe White House clearly decided that the nation\u2019s leading infectious disease expert was out over his skis to speak plainly about the worst pandemic in a century. His concern about controlling a public health crisis had become a distraction from Trump\u2019s effort to restart the economy, a central task of his reelection campaign.Fauci \u201cdoesn\u2019t necessarily \u2026 have the whole national interest in mind,\u201d Adm. Brett P. Giroir, assistant secretary for the Department of Health and Human Services, said on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d on Sunday. \u201cHe looks at it from a very narrow public health point of view.\u201dThe attacks on Fauci escalated when USA Today published an op-ed from White House trade adviser Peter Navarro on Tuesday in which he aired his grievances about the public health official. \u201cDr. Anthony Fauci has a good bedside manner with the public, but he has been wrong about everything I have interacted with him on,\u201d Navarro wrote.The White House attempted to downplay Navarro\u2019s falsehood-ridden attacks by asserting that he published the op-ed on his own without official approval. In prior administrations, this act would be a fireable offense. In this one, there\u2019s little indication that Navarro will be punished at all.Fauci told The Atlantic in an interview published Wednesday that he has no plans to step down and called the White House\u2019s attack against him \u201cbizarre,\u201d \u201cnonsense\u201d and \u201ccompletely wrong.\u201d\u201cUltimately, it hurts the president to do that,\u201d he said.\u00a0Passing The BuckTrump has continually refused to take any blame for negligence or errors in his administration\u2019s response to the pandemic.\u201cI don\u2019t take responsibility at all,\u201d he said at a now-infamous Rose Garden press conference on March 13, the day the nation began to go into lockdown.\u00a0It was instead former President Barack Obama\u2019s fault, Trump claimed. Trump\u2019s attempt to pass the buck to the previous administration came despite his disbanding of a pandemic response team at the National Security Council and his refusal to follow the plan used by the Obama administration to successfully respond to both the H1N1 and Ebola viruses.\u00a0More recently, Trump has claimed that former vice president Joe \u201cBiden and Obama stopped their testing,\u201d despite the coronavirus not existing until three years after they left office.Trump has stuck to that narrative, claiming that his own excellent work prevented potentially millions of additional deaths. At an event Tuesday that was billed as a White House press conference but quickly devolved into a rambling campaign rally-style speech, Trump railed against China, for \u201cconcealing\u201d and \u201cunleashing\u201d the coronavirus \u201cupon the world,\u201d and the World Health Organization \u2015 a go-to move to distract from his own botched pandemic response.\u00a0He dismissed the WHO as \u201ca puppet of China\u201d and a \u201cterrible deal,\u201d and bragged about cutting ties with the world body and redirecting the approximately $450 million the U.S. contributes to it each year.\u201cWe\u2019ve been I guess as tough as you can get on World Health,\u201d Trump said Tuesday. \u201cWe withdrew our money, we told them we\u2019re getting out. Doesn\u2019t mean that someday we won\u2019t go back in, maybe we will when it\u2019s correctly run. But they made a lot of bad predictions and they said a lot of bad things about what to do and how to do it, and they turned out to be wrong.It\u2019s truly baffling stuff from the leader of a country that is among the most ravaged by the coronavirus, with 3.45 million infections to date.Trump\u2019s withdrawal from the WHO is not the only counterproductive policy change that he has pursued due to his need to control his image rather than abide by decisions informed by public health science.The Real DamageThe president\u2019s rejection of expertise, histrionic defensiveness and bizarre false statements are not simply utterances of an uninformed man. They inform the administration\u2019s policies that are undermining efforts to control the virus\u2019s spread, which means more Americans will die.His administration was slow to fund testing across the country, failed to properly promote mask-wearing when it became clear it would help slow the virus\u2019s spread, purchased tens of millions of reserves of Trump\u2019s favorite unproven coronavirus remedy hydroxychloroquine and is now rerouting hospital data away from the CDC, in a seeming effort to keep the public in the dark.\u201cI said to my people, \u2018Slow the testing down, please,\u2019\u201d Trump told the crowd at an indoor campaign rally he hosted on June 20 that was likely the source of a surge in virus cases in Tulsa, Oklahoma.On June 24, the administration announced it would close 13 federally funded COVID testing sites.Trump has repeatedly claimed, falsely, that the only reason the country is seeing an increase in cases is because more tests are being conducted. Public health officials have countered this falsehood, pointing to the data on COVID-19 hospitalizations reported to the CDC.But the administration announced on Tuesday that hospitals should cease reporting such data to the CDC and instead direct it to a private data collector that the Department of Health and Human Services has contracted. The move puts the data collection under the control of more partisan officials close to the Trump White House where it is not currently publicly reported. Already, COVID tracking sites report that the digital CDC data stream they relied on to provide public updates on the virus has stopped.In much the same way that denying and undermining climate science allows Trump to justify scrapping and weakening environmental rules to the benefit of polluting industries that helped bankroll his campaign, covering up and dismissing COVID-19 data is about protecting himself.\u00a0But like climate science, the science of this virus is not on Trump\u2019s side. It shows that his team\u2019s lethargic initial response and subsequent push to quickly reopen the economy has had devastating impacts. And that\u2019s exactly why the president will spend the next four months spinning a revisionist history."}, {"cover": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/FSiJD_.RQzeZ8oMRtbnB.Q--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5f060b351f00003d07337b66.jpg", "topic": "BUSINESS", "title": "Big Oil\u2019 Fallback Plan Is Falling Flat", "author": "By Alexander C.

Crude prices plunged into negative territory at the start of the coronavirus pandemic, and oil giants in recent months cut dividends to shareholders and wrote down the value of their assets by tens of billions of dollars. Utilities this week abandoned a major gas pipeline as wind and solar smashed records. As of last month, 17 countries had set targets to phase out internal combustion engine vehicles.\u00a0Yet petrochemicals \u2015 the sector producing everything from plastics to polyester fabrics to paint \u2015 looked like a safe bet. Exxon Mobil Corp. is spending $20 billion on chemical and refining plants across the Gulf Coast. Royal Dutch Shell PLC is constructing a massive complex in Pennsylvania to churn ethane, a component in fracked natural gas, into polyethylene plastic. China\u2019s state-owned Sinopec Corp. last month opened its third petrochemical facility in 18 months.\u00a0There is, however, a \u201chole in the hedge,\u201d as The Economist magazine declared in a print headline last month. The price of plastic resins dropped amid the pandemic, and cheap oil is undercutting the United States\u2019 natural gas-based petrochemical buildout. Regulations are mounting as new research shows plastic pollution is so severe and ubiquitous that tiny particles are appearing in remote locales.\u00a0\u201cPetrochemicals and plastic will not be how the oil and gas industry grows its way out of this crisis or climbs its way out of debt,\u201d a report published Thursday by the nonprofit Center for International Environmental Law concluded. \u201cThe plastic market is saturated, and a short-term uptick in demand for personal protective equipment will not change the long-term downward trajectory of plastic use.\u201d\u00a0Plastic isn\u2019t going anywhere anytime soon. Between 1971 and 2015, demand for plastic outpaced that for other bulk materials such as cement, aluminum and steel, according to\u00a0International Energy Agency data. And demand keeps growing. By 2050, nearly half of all growth in oil demand is estimated to come from plastics.\u00a0But as oil and gas giants scale back drilling and lose billions on existing investments, the profit margins on plastics and other petrochemicals are slimming down. Prices for plastic resins \u2015 the raw pellets made from ethylene or other feedstocks \u2015 plunged in March, and few if any have recovered, according to a report by Plastics Technology, an industry\u00a0trade group.Refiners in Asia and Europe invested in making resins from naphtha, a flammable liquid mix distilled from oil, peat or coal.\u00a0In the U.S., where the fracking boom made natural gas cheap and plentiful, the industry instead built a fleet of \u201ccracker\u201d plants, sprawling complexes of pipes and furnaces that heat ethane \u2014 a component in natural gas \u2014 into ethylene and polyethylene. The IEA estimated\u00a0that 40% of the world\u2019s ethane-based production capacity is in the U.S. But the historic drop in oil prices \u201cessentially eliminated the huge, years-long competitive cost advantage that North American [natural gas-based polyethylene] producers have enjoyed over their international naphtha-based counterparts,\u201d Plastics Today, a trade publication, reported on June 30.\u00a0Regulations, meanwhile, are proliferating quickly as global outrage grows over the extent of plastic pollution. The presence of granular microplastics in the oceans, Great Lakes and even Arctic snow is well known. But researchers found tiny bits of airborne plastic in 98% of dust samples collected in 11 national parks and wilderness areas, according to a study published last month in the journal Science.By last year, 127 countries started regulating plastic bags. Eight U.S. states banned plastic bags as of the start of this year. In 2019, the European Parliament voted to ban many single-use plastic items by 2021 and require member states to collect 90% of plastic bottles by 2029. In January, China, the largest producer of single-use plastics, started phasing out most nonbiodegradable bags, straws and cutlery over the next two years.\u00a0COVID-19 may reverse the trend. As officials struggled to contain the virus, the industry and its allies began pressing to halt or reverse bans across the world.

Crude prices plunged into negative territory at the start of the coronavirus pandemic, and oil giants in recent months cut dividends to shareholders and wrote down the value of their assets by tens of billions of dollars. Utilities this week abandoned a major gas pipeline as wind and solar smashed records. As of last month, 17 countries had set targets to phase out internal combustion engine vehicles.\u00a0Yet petrochemicals \u2015 the sector producing everything from plastics to polyester fabrics to paint \u2015 looked like a safe bet. Exxon Mobil Corp. is spending $20 billion on chemical and refining plants across the Gulf Coast. Royal Dutch Shell PLC is constructing a massive complex in Pennsylvania to churn ethane, a component in fracked natural gas, into polyethylene plastic. China\u2019s state-owned Sinopec Corp. last month opened its third petrochemical facility in 18 months.\u00a0There is, however, a \u201chole in the hedge,\u201d as The Economist magazine declared in a print headline last month. The price of plastic resins dropped amid the pandemic, and cheap oil is undercutting the United States\u2019 natural gas-based petrochemical buildout. Regulations are mounting as new research shows plastic pollution is so severe and ubiquitous that tiny particles are appearing in remote locales.\u00a0\u201cPetrochemicals and plastic will not be how the oil and gas industry grows its way out of this crisis or climbs its way out of debt,\u201d a report published Thursday by the nonprofit Center for International Environmental Law concluded. \u201cThe plastic market is saturated, and a short-term uptick in demand for personal protective equipment will not change the long-term downward trajectory of plastic use.\u201d\u00a0Plastic isn\u2019t going anywhere anytime soon. Between 1971 and 2015, demand for plastic outpaced that for other bulk materials such as cement, aluminum and steel, according to\u00a0International Energy Agency data. And demand keeps growing. By 2050, nearly half of all growth in oil demand is estimated to come from plastics.\u00a0But as oil and gas giants scale back drilling and lose billions on existing investments, the profit margins on plastics and other petrochemicals are slimming down. Prices for plastic resins \u2015 the raw pellets made from ethylene or other feedstocks \u2015 plunged in March, and few if any have recovered, according to a report by Plastics Technology, an industry\u00a0trade group.Refiners in Asia and Europe invested in making resins from naphtha, a flammable liquid mix distilled from oil, peat or coal.\u00a0In the U.S., where the fracking boom made natural gas cheap and plentiful, the industry instead built a fleet of \u201ccracker\u201d plants, sprawling complexes of pipes and furnaces that heat ethane \u2014 a component in natural gas \u2014 into ethylene and polyethylene. The IEA estimated\u00a0that 40% of the world\u2019s ethane-based production capacity is in the U.S. But the historic drop in oil prices \u201cessentially eliminated the huge, years-long competitive cost advantage that North American [natural gas-based polyethylene] producers have enjoyed over their international naphtha-based counterparts,\u201d Plastics Today, a trade publication, reported on June 30.\u00a0Regulations, meanwhile, are proliferating quickly as global outrage grows over the extent of plastic pollution. The presence of granular microplastics in the oceans, Great Lakes and even Arctic snow is well known. But researchers found tiny bits of airborne plastic in 98% of dust samples collected in 11 national parks and wilderness areas, according to a study published last month in the journal Science.By last year, 127 countries started regulating plastic bags. Eight U.S. states banned plastic bags as of the start of this year. In 2019, the European Parliament voted to ban many single-use plastic items by 2021 and require member states to collect 90% of plastic bottles by 2029. In January, China, the largest producer of single-use plastics, started phasing out most nonbiodegradable bags, straws and cutlery over the next two years.\u00a0COVID-19 may reverse the trend. As officials struggled to contain the virus, the industry and its allies began pressing to halt or reverse bans across the world. While the European Union denied the request, the United Kingdom postponed its ban on some plastics until later this year. In the U.S., states such as New Hampshire banned reusable bags,\u00a0fearing they could spread the virus, in favor of single-use paper or plastic bags.The lobbying successes extend beyond plastics. Between March and July, 64% of the oil and gas industry\u2019s global efforts to increase financial support for fossil fuel production or roll back climate regulations were either \u201ccompletely\u201d or \u201cmostly successful,\u201d according to a study published Thursday by InfluenceMap, a British think tank that tracks corporate influence on policy.

I\u2019m sitting on millions of doses of it,\u201d he said in a combative interview on CNN.

Public health experts, including infectious diseases expert Dr. Anthony Fauci, leading the U.S. response to the COVID-19 crisis, have warned against promoting it because of the lack of widespread scientific consensus on the drug\u2019s use as a COVID-19 treatment.\u00a0Yet Trump and his administration continue to claim otherwise, including by retweeting discredited videos. At his COVID-19 press conference Tuesday, he again promoted the drug by citing a conspiracy theorist who falsely claimed it could \u201ccure\u201d COVID-19.On Wednesday, Navarro continued to attempt to discredit Fauci, which he previously did in an op-ed by cherry-picking statements from Fauci from earlier in the pandemic.Navarro ended the interview by referencing \u201cthe China virus.\u201d Trump and his allies have repeatedly used the racist phrase and others to refer to COVID-19. Throughout this year, Asian Americans have experienced a cascade of racist attacks and harassment related to the pandemic.When Berman pointed out the surge in anti-Asian racism, Navarro replied: \u201cWe love the Chinese people. They are hardworking.\u201d"}]
