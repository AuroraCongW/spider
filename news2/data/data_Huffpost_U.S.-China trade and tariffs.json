Steve Daines, with long-standing business ties in China, has become a hardliner toward the country almost overnight.", "content": "A number of Republican senators seeking reelection in November are posing as China hawks after careers spent encouraging, and sometimes profiting from, investments by U.S. corporations in the country.\u00a0Despite their previous stances and links, these Republicans enthusiastically have adopted the poll-tested GOP talking point of blaming the Chinese government for the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic and casting themselves, alongside President Donald Trump, as the group uniquely capable of confronting the U.S. rival.But Democrats are eager to undermine the new GOP messaging by focusing on the more dovish records these Republicans have toward China.In Montana, for instance, where GOP Sen. Steve Daines faces a tough challenge from Democratic Gov. Steve Bullock, Democrats are already spending money to cast doubt on Daines\u2019 commitment to take a tougher line with China.Before entering Congress, Daines spent years as an executive at Procter & Gamble at a time when the industrial giant was shutting down production facilities across the U.S. and expanding production in China. Daines, who lived in China for much of the 1990s, oversaw the company\u2019s efforts to infiltrate the nascent Chinese consumer market with the active collaboration of the ruling Chinese Communist Party.Daines went on to become a champion of U.S.-China relations in Congress, supporting trade agreements that increased U.S. companies\u2019 presence in the country.\u00a0The Senate Majority PAC, a Democratic super political action committee, is spending more than $1 million to air a TV ad across Montana that highlights Daines\u2019 work for Procter & Gamble.\u00a0\u201cDaines got rich while we struggle to make ends meet,\u201d the spot\u2019s narrator says. \u201cSteve Daines profits from our pain.\u201dNo proof has surfaced that Daines directly profited from, or presided over, the offshoring of U.S. jobs by Procter & Gamble. The company\u00a0did downsize its workforce in 1993, laying off 13,000 workers \u2015 4,000 of them in the U.S.\u00a0The company simultaneously began scaling up its operations in China, which Daines was heavily involved in. He lived in Guangzhou, China, from 1992 to 1997, shepherding P&G\u2019s expansion in the country.\u00a0Both Daines and the company\u00a0say that his responsibilities were limited to helping P&G penetrate the nascent Chinese consumer market, overseeing manufacturing expansion to sell household products to Chinese consumers, rather than to export them back to the U.S. At the time, P&G was building relationships with the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s neighborhood watch committees to hawk their products, a practice that other multinational corporations would subsequently emulate.As a guest earlier this month on the conservative talk radio show \u201cOpen for Business with Tom and Shane\u201d in his home state, Daines began to get annoyed when a Montanan who called in accused him of moving American factories to China.\u201cWe were producing and selling products to compete directly with the Chinese companies,\u201d Daines responded. \u201cNothing we produced there was shipped back to the United States.\u201dIn any event, the federal government recognized two specific cases during that same period when P&G replaced U.S. production with plants overseas. The Department of Labor awarded workers laid off at P&G plants in Staten Island, New York, and Hatboro, Pennsylvania, with trade adjustment assistance benefits reserved for workers who lost their jobs due to offshoring.And even if Daines was not involved in offshoring jobs to China during his tenure at P&G, his current harsh line against the country runs counter to a congressional career spent encouraging deeper trade ties between the country and the U.S.\u00a0Daines has made \u201cholding China accountable\u201d a central theme of his reelection campaign since early April. In a Facebook ad capable of reaching hundreds of thousands of people, Daines has promised to \u201cEXPOSE China\u2019s deadly cover-up of the China virus.\u201d The language closely mirrors the recommendations of the campaign arm for Senate Republicans, which advised candidates in an April memo to \u201cattack China\u201d for its alleged role in allowing the novel coronavirus to spread, and to also run on re-shoring domestic manufacturing.But as The Daily Beast reported in May, Daines stands out on Capitol Hill as a cheerleader for U.S.-China relations prior to the COVID-19 outbreak. He has been such an outspoken advocate of opening Chinese markets to Montana cattle exports that he made his fifth official trip to China last August.He also has used those trips to reassure the Chinese government that the U.S. has no plans to stop recognizing Chinese sovereignty over Taiwan. China\u2019s ambassador to the U.S. has called Daines China\u2019s \u201cambassador to Congress.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s kind of hard to have this career in the private sector and then in Congress support this free trade with China and then come out as someone who is attacking China,\u201d said David Parker, a Montana State University political scientist whose book, \u201cBattle for the Big Sky,\u201d chronicled Daines\u2019 2014 election. \u201cIt just doesn\u2019t seem to me like it\u2019s terribly believable.\u201d\u00a0A spokesperson for Daines\u2019 campaign did not respond to multiple requests for comment on whether his history of support for U.S.-China trade and diplomatic relations is inconsistent with his more hawkish tone as a candidate.Two other Republican senators facing contentious re-election battles also have histories of support for U.S. trade with China that they are now rushing to offset with hawkish positions.In 2015, GOP Sens. Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Cory Gardner of Colorado voted against both a bipartisan amendment that would have made cracking down on currency manipulation a higher priority in U.S. trade policy and a bipartisan bill vesting the Customs and Border Protection agency with greater authority to enforce trade agreement compliance. (Many economists blame China\u2019s policy of boosting the value of the U.S. dollar and suppressing the value of its own currency for artificially increasing the attractiveness of Chinese exports, thus contributing to the loss of manufacturing jobs in the U.S.)That same year, both senators also voted against a Democratic-backed bill that would have enacted tax benefits for companies that create jobs in the U.S. and levied tax penalties on companies that move U.S.-based jobs overseas. (Daines likewise did not vote for these three measures.)Now Tillis is touting his co-sponsorship of a bill incentivizing domestic production of personal protective equipment.\u00a0\u00a0Gardner remains opposed to the Trump administration\u2019s use of tariffs in trade with China, but has taken a more aggressive line toward the country, calling for the Department of Defense to encourage domestic mining of rare Earth minerals to reduce dependence on imports from there.\u00a0And One Nation, a pro-Gardner group, is airing a TV spot claiming the incumbent has a \u201clong track record of getting tough on China.\u201d\u00a0Matt Corridoni, a spokesman for the Democratic Senate Majority PAC, said, \u201cRepublicans are so desperate to claw their way out of their leadership failures on COVID-19 that they\u2019re latching onto the GOP anti-China playbook as a life raft. Their hypocrisy knows no bounds, and if voters don\u2019t reject them for that, they\u2019ll certainly reject them for playing politics while Americans suffer.\u201d\u00a0A spokesperson for Gardner\u2019s campaign did not respond to a request for comment.Tillis campaign spokesperson Andrew Romeo referred HuffPost to a host of comments from Tillis that criticized China\u2019s human rights record, characterized the country as a military threat, and called for tougher enforcement of bilateral trade rules, including safeguards on U.S. intellectual property. (Out of 15 examples that the campaign provided, however, just two date to before Trump\u2019s election in 2016 on an anti-China platform.)Tillis \u201chas been fighting to hold China accountable for years on trade, military matters, human rights and intellectual property, and has a plan to ramp up those efforts in the wake of COVID-19,\u201d Romeo said in a statement.As of now, the Daines-Bullock faceoff in Montana remains the campaign where U.S.-China relations have played the biggest role. The race has become increasingly seen as crucial in the battle for Senate control, with Bullock \u2015 a popular two-term governor \u2015 given a fighting chance to unseat Daines in a GOP-leaning state.Bullock\u2019s campaign has declined to comment on Daines\u2019 shift on U.S.-China relations, leaving that to the Senate Majority PAC and the Montana Democratic Party.\u201cDaines\u2019 new talking points are nothing more than a desperate attempt to save his political career,\u201d Christina Wilkes, a spokesperson for the state party, said in a statement. \u201cThis dishonest pivot is just further evidence that Montanans can\u2019t trust him on the issues.\u201dBullock, a short-lived 2020 presidential candidate, delighted national Democrats when he announced his plans to challenge Daines in March. Bullock won reelection as governor by 4 percentage points\u00a0in 2016 as Trump was carrying Montana by 20 points in the presidential race.)\u00a0In his role as Montana\u2019s chief executive during the coronavirus pandemic, Bullock has been an omnipresent public figure for the past few months, even as normal campaigning has slowed to a trickle. The Washington-based Cook Political Report moved the race from \u201clean Republican\u201d to a \u201ctoss-up\u201d in June.But as with virtually any bid to dislodge an incumbent, Bullock must persuade voters not only of his basic suitability, but that Daines doesn\u2019t merit another term. Undercutting Daines\u2019 self-portrayal as a China hawk could neutralize the main tool that he and other Republicans are relying on to deflect attention from Trump\u2019s mismanagement of COVID-19 and the accompanying economic fallout.\u00a0\u201cThe fact that Steve Daines is bringing up the issue of China fundamentally shows that he has some weaknesses because it\u2019s a risky gamble,\u201d Parker said."}]
