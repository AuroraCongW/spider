He described \u201cso-called victims\u201d of human rights violations as being either separatists or \u201cactors trained by anti-China forces in the U.S. and other Western countries.\u201dAD\u201cThere are so many fallacies and lies that permeate Western media,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cIt can be called the lies of the century.\u201dThe rising tensions come as U.S. President Donald Trump and his administration push Washington and Beijing toward a new era of ever-growing confrontation.The U.S. government last week imposed trade sanctions on 11 companies it says are implicated in human rights abuses. The sanctions upped U.S. pressure on Beijing over Xinjiang, where the ruling Communist Party is accused of mass detentions, forced labor, forced birth control and other abuses against Muslim minorities.ADLiu added that disputes over human rights, the imposition of a new security law in Hong Kong and Britain\u2019s decision to ban Chinese tech giant Huawei from taking part in building a new high speed phone network had \u201cseriously poisoned the atmosphere\u201d of China\u2019s relations with Britain.\u2019\u2019AD\u201cChina and U.K. should have enough wisdom and capability to manage and deal with these differences, rather than allowing anti-China forces and Cold War warriors to kidnap (the) China-U.K. relationship,\u2019\u2019 he said.The United States has lobbied its allies to shun Huawei, because it says the Chinese government could use the company\u2019s technology to spy on Western nations. Huawei denies the allegations and argues that U.S. protectionism is behind the move.ADBritain in recent weeks also suspended an extradition treaty with Hong Kong and offered refuge for millions of eligible Hong Kongers who feel threatened by Beijing\u2019s tightening grip on the semi-autonomous city. Liu reiterated his previous comment that Britain should stop meddling in Hong Kong.\u201cChina respects U.K. sovereignty and has never interfered in the U.K.\u2019s internal affairs,\u2019\u2019 the ambassador said. \u201cIt is important the U.K. will do the same - namely, respect China\u2019s sovereignty and stop interfering in Hong Kong\u2019s affairs, which are China\u2019s internal affairs, so as to avoid further damage to the China-UK relationship.\u201dADLiu hammered the point that the U.K. and its people needed to think independently of the hawkish signals coming from the Trump administration. He said Britain was at a \u201ccritical historical juncture\u201d in how it wanted to treat China.AD\u201cIt\u2019s our hope that the U.K. would resist the pressure and coercion from a certain country and provide an open, fair, transparent and non-discriminatory environment for Chinese investment so as to bring back the confidence of Chinese businesses in the U.K,\u201d he said.Earlier this month, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo visited London and applauded British Prime Minister Boris Johnson for the decision to bar Huawei from 5G and other responses to the challenges raised by China. Pompeo said the U.S. supports \u201cthose sovereign choices, we think, \u2018Well done.\u2019\u201dIn another sign of fraying relations, U.K. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab condemned the Hong Kong government\u2019s decision to disqualify 12 pro-democracy nominees from a September legislative election. Authorities said they failed to uphold the city\u2019s mini-constitution and pledge allegiance to Hong Kong and Beijing.\u201cIt is clear they have been disqualified because of their political views, undermining the integrity of \u2018one country, two systems\u2019 and the rights and freedoms guaranteed in the joint declaration and Hong Kong\u2019s basic law,\u201d Raab said.Copyright 2020 The Associated Press.

That helps to explain why the media paid so little attention, over the past two weeks, when Joe Biden released his plans to fight climate change and revive the economy. The climate change plan is ambitious and forward-thinking, but more interesting is the economic plan, which promises \u201cto ensure the future is \u2018made in all of America.\u2019\u2009\u201d That sounds like an America First agenda, and sure enough, President Trump accused Biden of stealing his ideas. But in fact, while the plan is politically clever in moving directly onto Trump\u2019s turf of economic nationalism, it is much better than the president\u2019s approach.First and most important is what the plan does not do. It is not a mercantilist call for tariffs and trade wars, hallmarks of the Trump presidency. These Trump policies have failed by any measure. The evidence is so clear that when Biden released a fiery ad saying Trump \u201clost\u201d the trade war with China, Politifact\u2019s only quibble with that claim was it should have been present tense \u201closing.\u201d The group pointed to the following studies from 2019: a Federal Reserve report that determined the tariffs \u201chave not boosted manufacturing employment or output, even as they increased producer prices\u201d; a Moody\u2019s analysis finding that the trade war had cost 300,000 U.S. jobs; and a Federal Reserve study assessing the cost of these tariffs to the average American household at about $800 per year, erasing the benefits of the Trump tax cut. Oxford Economics estimated the trade war shaved 0.3 percent off U.S. gross domestic product growth last year.Support our journalism.

Biden proposes raising spending by $300 billion over four years, which represents a 60 percent increase over 2018 spending. If enacted, this would reverse the steady decline in federal investment in science and technology since its heyday in the 1950s and 1960s. (To get to those levels would still require hundreds of billions more.) Those investments led to the personal computer, the Internet, the Global Positioning System and a host of other technologies that have transformed the economy. More recently, it is worth remembering, an Energy Department loan of $465 million is what enabled Tesla to establish itself and experiment with electric cars. The Biden plan proposes investments in 5G technology, electric cars, lightweight materials and artificial intelligence. Some of this money will be wasted \u2014 as also happens to investments from venture capital firms \u2014 but all you need is for some, like Tesla, to succeed big.ADADThe plan also has a $400 billion \u201cBuy American\u201d component. The theory behind this is sensible. But the danger of this kind of approach is that it can too often become \u201cindustrial policy,\u201d with the government trying to revive bygone industries like steel (as Biden wants to do) and favoring firms with the best lobbyists. More generally, the track record of most rich countries in practicing industrial policy has been pretty bad. Experts used to point to Japan as the country that had mastered government-directed investment, except that it turned out that Japan\u2019s best companies all came out of its fiercely competitive private sector. The state-sponsored ones mostly did poorly. (China is different because its biggest advantage is not smart government investments but low wages.)The best model is not for government to set up or subsidize specific companies or industries, but to let the market know that it will buy certain kinds of innovative products, which then gives the private sector an incentive to produce them. As late as 1962, the U.S. government was responsible for purchasing 100 percent of all semiconductor chips produced in the country, which is what allowed that industry to become viable. Similarly, NASA orders powerfully helped the computer industry in the 1960s. Biden rightly wants to emulate this approach to support today\u2019s breakthrough technologies, though key agencies in the federal government in those days were more efficient and operated with far greater insulation from special interests.A final caution: \u201cBuy American\u201d has been around for a long time. In fact, it was initiated in 1933, on the last day of Herbert Hoover\u2019s term in office, responding to a \u201cBuy British\u201d plan announced in London. The result of these kinds of moves sent the world into a downward spiral of protectionism and nationalism, impoverishing ordinary people, and creating a dangerous international climate. Let\u2019s keep that history in mind as we implement the next version of Buy American.ADAD\n\nRead more from Fareed Zakaria\u2019s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his daily newsletter.Read more: Jennifer Rubin: Joe Biden gives a big, bold, normal speech on climate changeThe Post\u2019s View: Biden sets a relatively moderate economic coursePaul Waldman: Our economy is in crisis.
