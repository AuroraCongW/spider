The act imposes sanctions on entities that help violate Hong Kong's autonomy and financial institutions that do business with them, and comes as a response to the passage of a \"national security\" law that tightened Beijing's grip on Hong Kong \u2014 which has been semi-autonomous from the mainland since 1997.The Chinese law, implemented earlier this summer, says that those who destroy government facilities and utilities would be considered subversive. Damaging public transportation facilities and arson would constitute acts of terrorism. Any person taking part in secessionist activities, whether organizing or participating, would violate the law regardless of whether violence is used.It comes after a full year of pro-democracy protests in the former British territory that was handed over to China 23 years ago on the condition that it would keep\u00a0a high degree of autonomy from mainland China and a British-style rule of law \u2014\u00a0a \"one country, two systems\" framework. China has slowly encroached on Hong Kong's autonomy, leading U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo early this year to declare that it is \"no longer autonomous.\"The new law prohibits what Beijing views as secessionist, subversive or terrorist activities or as foreign intervention in Hong Kong affairs and is seen as a direct response to the protest\u2019s calls for democracy. Under the law, police now have sweeping powers to conduct searches without warrants and order internet service providers and platforms to remove messages deemed to be in violation of the legislation.With Trump\u2019s executive order, exports from Hong Kong will be subject to the same tariffs the White House has imposed on goods from mainland China \u2013 marking a blow for leaders in Beijing as they struggle to revamp their economy amid the coronavirus pandemic and cutting off a lucrative loophole. The announcement from Trump also comes a day after the White House rejected nearly all of\u00a0\u2019s claims in the contested South China Sea.The administration presented the decision as an attempt to curb China\u2019s increasing assertiveness in the region with a commitment to recognizing international law. But it will almost certainly have the more immediate effect of further infuriating the Chinese, who are already retaliating against numerous U.S. sanctions and other penalties on other matters.Ties between China and the U.S. have deteriorated steadily over the coronavirus pandemic, human rights, Beijing policy toward Hong Kong and trade. The Trump administration has also slapped visa bans on Chinese officials deemed responsible for barring foreigners\u2019 access to Tibet, along with those seen as enforcing a clampdown on civil rights in Hong Kong.Tensions ratcheted up in the last few days with the actions taken by both the U.S. and China.On Monday, China said\u00a0it will impose sanctions on three U.S. lawmakers and one ambassador in response to similar actions taken by the U.S. last week against Chinese officials over alleged human rights abuses against Muslims in the Xinjiang region.U.S. Senators Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz, Rep. Chris Smith and Ambassador for Religious Freedom Sam Brownback were targeted, as was the Congressional-Executive Commission on China. The four have been critical of the ruling Communist Party\u2019s policies toward minority groups and people of faith.Foreign ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying said the U.S. move had \u201cseriously damaged China-U.S. relations\u201d and that China was determined to uphold its national sovereignty against what it sees as interference in its internal affairs.\u201cChina will respond further according to the development of the situation,\u201d Hua said.", "comment": "(4,177)", "topic": "Donald Trump", "date": " July 14"}, {"cover": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/07/156/88/AP20182021708026.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "title": "Head of Chinese CDC says he's taking experimental coronavirus drug", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/world/head-of-chinese-cdc-says-hes-taking-experimental-coronavirus-drug", "subtitle": "The director of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention said that he has been injected with an experimental coronavirus vaccine, in order to encourage members of the public to follow suit once a vaccine has been approved.", "keyword": "China and the world order", "website": "Fox News", "author": "Caitlin McFall", "content": "The director of the  Center for Disease Control and Prevention said that he has been injected with an experimental  vaccine, in order to encourage members of the public to follow suit once a vaccine has been approved.\"I\u2019m going to reveal something undercover: I am injected with one of the vaccines,\u201d\u00a0Gao Fu reportedly said in a webinar Sunday.\u201cI hope it will work,\u201d he added.The private firm, SinoPharm, reportedly gave a\u00a0vaccine injection to all members of its staff earlier this month, though it had not been approved for testing by the government \u2013 a move that health experts questioned ethically.Gao did not say whether his vaccine injection is part of a government-approved human trial.The U.S. and the U.K. have been working on various vaccines in the effort beat China in\u00a0finding a cure for the coronavirus, a move that would be a win scientifically and politically as the two western countries have shown recent signs of solidarity against the Chinese government.China reportedly has eight of the roughly two dozen vaccines being developed globally, the most out of any country.Gao did not specify which vaccine he took, but said he did it in an effort to squash recent conspiracy theories that have arisen around the scientific community.\u201cEverybody has suspicions about the new coronavirus vaccine,\u201d Gao said. \u201cAs a scientist, you\u2019ve got to be brave. \u2026 If even we didn\u2019t do it, how can we persuade the whole world \u2014 all the people, the public \u2014 to be vaccinated?\u201dGao received staunch criticism nationally and internationally for his initial handling of the coronavirus outbreak, disappearing from the public eye until late April when he gave an  with CGTN, a state-run media outlet.U.S.-China relations have become increasingly strained over the last several months, stemming from how China initially handled the outbreak of the virus.

However, the timeline modification now clarifies that the first notification came from the WHO's Beijing office rather than from Beijing authorities.Both the WHO and the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) have vehemently insisted that there was no coverup or collusion, despite an investigation from the U.S. government which led to President Trump announcing in late May that the American taxpayer would no longer be funding the organization over its mishandling of the pandemic.For decades, the U.S. served as the WHO's largest donor \u2013 forking out around $400 million annually and some 10\u00a0times more than China. In response, Beijing had pledged to vastly increase the amount it gives the organization.A spokesperson for the WHO did not immediately respond to a request for comment to clarify the timeline change and why it was enhanced more than six months after the initial findings.In a statement released to media outlets over the weekend, the agency said \u2013 as per  \u2013 that the new timeline \"gives more details\" regarding the early days of the burgeoning crisis that has since taken the lives of more than half a million people globally.But the latest narrative change is one of just many in recent months pertaining to how much the WHO knew and its questionable relationship with Chinese officials.For one, doctors in Wuhan were aware the virus could spread between humans as early as the beginning of December, with patients falling ill despite having had no exposure to the wet market.The first confirmed case from inside Wuhan was said to have been logged on Dec.\u00a08, a woman who claimed to have not been connected to the market. It raises questions about what went on during the weeks in between, the WHO's own investigative abilities and why an initial tweet sent by the WHO on Jan.\u00a014 said there was \"no evidence of human to human transmission.\"Furthermore, on Feb.\u00a03, several weeks after scores of countries \u2013 including the United States \u2013 had confirmed cases of the new illness, WHO's Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus proclaimed that \"the spread to other countries is minimal and slow,\" and the virus could be \"contained easily\" as a result of China's \"strategy and efforts.\" His comments came a week after the health chief met with Chinese\u00a0President\u00a0Xi Jinping.Recent reports have also pointed to the notion that China halted the release of vital information to the public for several days and waited more than a week to release the genome publicly so that diagnostic tests could be developed by other countries.", "comment": "(3,146)", "topic": "World Health Organization", "date": " July 6"}, {"cover": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/07/156/88/Trump-Mt-Rushmore-Slideshow-07.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "title": "Native scholar says Communist China has 'met its match' with Trump admin following consulate closure", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/politics/scholar-communist-china-met-match-with-the-trump-admin-consulate-closure", "subtitle": "Native Chinese scholar and author Helen\u00a0Raleigh said the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has finally \"met its match\" with the Trump administration, following a raid by federal agents on the consulate in Houston, suspected of harboring spies.\u00a0", "keyword": "China and the world order", "website": "Fox News", "author": "Nick Givas", "content": "Native Chinese scholar and author Helen\u00a0Raleigh said the  Communist Party (CCP) has finally \"met its match\" with the  administration, following a raid by federal agents on the consulate in , Texas, suspected of harboring spies.Raleigh, an immigration policy fellow at the Centennial Institute in Colorado,\u00a0told Fox News the 's aggressive stance has been a wake-up call for China's government and is not something its officials are used to dealing with.\"The CCP believes\u00a0the law of the jungle.

Chinese officials refused to allow any first responders to enter to extinguish the fires, Fox 26 in Houston reported.\"There are a series of steps that the Trump administration has taken -- particularly last week almost on a daily basis -- related to new sanctions and new policy changes against the CCP,\" Raleigh said.\u00a0\"But the biggest news was the closure of China's consulate in Houston and then China retaliated, closing the U.S. Consulate in\u00a0.\"She then cited Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's speech about China this week and said he is leading a reversal in decades-old policy that championed the economic liberation of the Chinese people.\"He identified the problem in the U.S.-China relationship, which are the same problems that China has with the rest of the world,\" Raleigh continued. \"China has a very different political and ideological system, especially compared to free nations like the United States. For the past several decades, free nations mistakenly thought that as long as they keep engaging China, engaging the CCP, eventually with economic liberation -- the CCP would change. The Chinese system would become a more liberal and open society like ours. Secretary Pompeo in his speech recognized that this assumption was wrong and it's been wrong for several decades.\"She added:\u00a0\"This was not his first speech on the subject and it's probably one of the only things that people from both parties can agree upon. That the past approach has failed. Sec. Pompeo summarized the Trump administration's China policy in two words -- 'induce change.' They want to induce a change of behaviors of the CCP.\"The administration wants\u00a0to achieve this goal in two steps at the same time, Raleigh explained. The first step involved\u00a0becoming very confrontational with the CCP in terms of trade negotiations, charges of espionage, the altering of visa policy and the closure of the consulate -- all of which represented a \"very dramatic, serious step.\"\"They've basically matched the intensity of the Chinese aggressiveness,\" she added. The second step would see China return to the negotiating table on various major issues.Raleigh, who has publicly  out against the Chinese government's tactics and writes as a  for The Federalist,\u00a0also touched upon how past U.S. administrations were unwilling to bear the cost of a confrontation with China until the most recent push from\u00a0.\"In the past four decades, China has been very aggressively pressing the limits. It is single-minded. They want to become the sole world power and change the world order to fit China's ideology,\" she said. \"Past administrations from George W. Bush to Barack Obama worried about the cost of confrontation -- on the economic and military front. The cost of confronting them has become so much greater now that past administrations, as well as other countries, didn't want to deal with it. Until the Trump administration [got involved].\"China is so powerful today, no matter which strategy the United States chooses, it's going to come with a cost,\" Raleigh added. \"There's no way to avoid a cost. So it's really coming down to how much cost we are ready to bear. And keep in mind, when China and the U.S. confront each other, China bears cost too. Both countries need to calculate how much of a cost they are willing to bear.\"", "comment": "(13,106)", "topic": "China", "date": " July 25"}, {"cover":

in the South China Sea and accused them of conducting a \u201ccampaign of bullying to control\u201d\u00a0offshore resources and energy development.The secretary\u2019s comments were the first time the U.S. has challenged China\u2019s legal authority in the region, calling their actions \u201ccompletely unlawful.\u201d\u201cAmerica stands with our Southeast Asian allies and partners in protecting their sovereign rights to offshore resources, consistent with their rights and obligations under international law,\u201d Pompeo said.China further retaliated against U.S. involvement in the area by placing sanctions on Lockheed Martin Corp. after a proposal for missile sales to Taiwan was approved by the Department of Defense and the State Department. \u201cWe had an American company conducting business that was consistent with American foreign policy,\u201d Pompeo told reporters Wednesday.\u201cI regret that the Chinese Communist Party chose to make that threat against Lockheed Martin.\u201dPompeo also applauded the U.K.\u2019s decision this week to rescind their agreement on partially working with Huawei to develop their 5G capabilities, a move directly related to pressure from the U.S.U.S. security officials had previously warned their British allies that they would likely sever all intelligence sharing practices should the U.K. foster a relationship with the Chinese telecommunications company.\u201cThis is a Chinese Communist Party that is acting in a way that poses real threats to the world, and the United States is going to respond in each of those venues to make sure that we preserve American national security and impose costs on the Chinese Communist Party in order to achieve the change in behavior that will have a good outcome,\u201d Pompeo said

These officials and their immediate families will be barred from entering the U.S. and any of their international assets will be frozen.What makes this announcement even more significant is that the most senior official on this latest sanction list is Chen Quanguo, a member of CCP's elite 25-member Politburo, which is the most powerful political body in  and counts CCP's General Secretary Xi Jinping as its most senior member. No previous U.S. administrations had ever imposed sanctions on any CCP official at this senior level. This announcement came one week after the Associated Press reported that the CCP has imposed draconian birth control measures in order to limit Muslim population growth.Early\u00a0this year, President Trump\u00a0signed the\u00a0Uyghur  Policy Act of 2020, which gives him authority to impose sanctions against individuals in China involved in human rights violations against Uyghur and other ethnic groups in Xinjiang. Besides punishing CCP officials, the Trump administration also warned\u00a0recently that it would crack down on U.S. businesses, organizations and individuals who either contributed to human rights abuses or benefited from forced labor in Xinjiang or elsewhere in China.Secretary of State Mike Pompeo made it clear that \u201cthe United States will not stand idly by as the Chinese Communist party carries out human rights abuses targeting Uighurs, ethnic Kazakhs and members of other minority groups in Xinjiang, to include forced labor, arbitrary mass detention, and forced population control, and attempts to erase their culture and Muslim faith.\u201d\u00a0 The Trump administration certainly backed up its words with actions.The rest of the world has been aware of the CCP's human rights abuses in Xinjiang since 2016, yet other than paying lip service, no other government nor the United Nation's Human Rights Council has taken any meaningful steps to address such abuses like the Trump administration has done. The Trump administration's latest sanctions also came only one day after the administration issued visa bans against CCP officials who are responsible for barring foreigners' access to Tibet.Since President Trump signed the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act last year, Secretary Pompeo indicated that more sanctions are coming against Chinese officials who are responsible for enforcing Beijing's new national security law, which has already effectively curbed Hong Kong's autonomy and Hong Kongers' long-cherished political freedom since it came into effect at midnight of June 30.The Trump administration's one-two punch on China's human rights issues is unprecedented and it has done more to address China's human rights issues than all previous administrations, including those run by Republican presidents.For example, after Beijing brutally cracked down on peaceful pro-democracy protests in Tiananmen Square in 1989, President George H.W. Bush initially condemned Beijing's actions and temporarily suspended some arms sales to China.\u00a0 However, rather than taking a strong stand, he quickly announced \"now is the time to look beyond the moment to important and enduring aspects of this vital relationship for the United States.\"The Bush administration's willingness to continue to do business with Beijing while overlooking bloodstains on the streets only strengthened the CCP's cynicism that Western democracies are nothing but a greedy bunch who are always keen on trading professed values for money. The CCP often quotes Vladimir Lenin's words, \"The Capitalists will sell us the rope with which we will hang them\" to show their contempt for western democracies.Minxin Pei, a professor of government at Claremont McKenna College wrote recently that \"such cynicism now permeates China\u2019s strategy of asserting full control over Hong Kong. Chinese leaders expect the West\u2019s anger at their actions to fade quickly, calculating that Western firms are too heavily invested in the city to let the perils of China\u2019s police state be a deal-breaker.\"From President George H. W. Bush to President Barack Obama, every administration had proved that the CCP's cynicism was right. However, Pei continued, \"in Trump and his national-security hawks, China has finally met its match... no CCP leader ever imagined that the US government would be willing to write off the Chinese market in pursuit of broader geopolitical objectives,\" including taking a strong stand for human rights issues in China.One person in the Trump administration who stands out and who has been consistently and relentlessly advocating for human rights issues in China is Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo. When he speaks about China, he always makes the distinction between the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people.He consistently emphasizes that his criticism of the CCP is not to create confrontation but out of the hope that the CCP will \"respect basic human rights of its own people\" and \"the genius of its people to flourish.\" He mentions human rights in every speech on China and he has been quickly and openly condemned Beijing's human rights abuses either through issuing statements or social media posts, time and again.More importantly, Secretary Pompeo always backs up his words with actions. Last year, he met with Hong Kong pro-democracy leader Martin Lee and the publisher of Apple Daily, Jimmy Lai, both of whom were arrested by Hong Kong police early this year for their support and participation of what Hong Kong authorities deemed \u201cunlawful protests\u201d from August to September 2019.On May 27, 2020, less than a week after Beijing announced it intended to impose a new national security law on Hong Kong, Secretary Pompeo\u00a0provided his certification\u00a0to Congress, stating \u201cHong Kong is no longer autonomous from China.\u201dHis certification, which is required under the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, enables the Trump administration to identify proper response to Beijing's breach of an international treaty it signed with Great Britain in 1984, which was supposed to guarantee Hong Kong's semi-autonomy status for 50 years.Then on the eve of the 31st year anniversary of the 1989 Tiananmen Square Massacre, Secretary Pompeo met former student leaders and survivors.\u00a0 His words and actions advocating for human rights in China earned him vicious attacks from China's state-owned media which called him a \"common enemy of mankind.\u201d\u00a0 They should have known that no amount of name-calling will silence Secretary Pompeo.Many Americans are not aware of what the Trump administration has done to address human rights issues in China because mainstream liberal media would much rather spend their energy and time attacking the administration than actually reporting on the administration's accomplishments. No doubt the CCP is delighted to have Americans\u2019 liberal media outlets doing its bidding, free of charge.It's time American people give the Trump administration credit where credit is due, for its global leadership and all the remarkable actions it has taken to hold the CCP accountable for human rights abuses in China.", "comment": "(133)", "topic": "OPINION", "date": " July 13"}, {"cover": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/07/156/88/Tibetan-exile-shouts-AP.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "title": "Cultural genocide?

And just recently, Chinese authorities ordered\u00a0Tibetans to\u00a0remove their beautiful prayer flags\u00a0from villages and hilltops.

The retaliatory move came just days after Washington ordered the Chinese consulate in Houston\u00a0closed over\u00a0espionage concerns.However, foreign policy analysts underscore that closing the Chengdu location was a way to further remove the U.S. from monitoring  in Tibet.Nestled in the southwest crevice of China, Tibet also borders Bhutan, Burma, Nepal\u00a0and India.\u00a0Its legal status is also subject to debate \u2013 Tibetans claim their country is independent, while the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) of the People's Republic of China (PRC) claims it belongs to them.Human rights activists widely claim a multitude of international law violations in the historic, mountainous terrain. According to Amnesty International's most recent , \"the human rights situation continued to be marked by a systematic crackdown on dissent,\" and that Tibetan areas were especially subject to \"repression conducted under the guise of 'anti-separatism' or 'counter-terrorism.'\"In its 2019 Human Rights Situation report, the India-based Tibetan Centre for Human Rights and Democracy (TCHRD) claimed that Beijing was using an extensive amount of surveillance technology\u00a0 to \"suppress Tibetans and instill fear,\" and \"violate the right to freedom of expression and privacy of journalists, bloggers, and human rights defenders.\"Others call the CCP's iron-fist\u00a0\"cultural genocide,\" as the Dalai Lama framed it in 2008.And even though China's constitution prohibits the state, public organizations and individuals from forcing religion on citizens,\u00a0the U.S. claims there is anything but  \u2013 especially when it comes to Tibet. The vast majority of ethnic Tibetans practice Buddhism; however, some across the Tibetan Plateau engage in the pre-Buddhist religion of Bon. Small segments also practice Islam, Catholicism\u00a0or Protestantism.A State Department \u00a0last month stressed that government \"regulations control all aspects of Tibetan Buddhism, including religious venues, groups, personnel and schools,\" and that some in the Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR) and other Tibetan areas have been subject to \"forced disappearances, arrests, torture, physical abuse, including sexual abuse, and prolonged detentions without trial of individuals due to their religious practices.\"\"Former detainees reported being beaten until they lost consciousness and being shocked with electric batons. There were reports that monks and nuns were forced to wear military clothing and undergo political indoctrination in detention centers,\" the report stated. \"The government continued to restrict the size of Buddhist monasteries and other institutions and to implement a campaign begun in 2016 to evict monks and nuns from monasteries and prohibit them from practicing elsewhere.\"Chinese authorities have evicted between 6,000 and 17,000 Tibetan and Han Chinese monks and nuns from Larung Gar and Yachen Gar Tibetan Buddhist Institutes, the report said.\u00a0Children also were restricted from many traditional religious festivals and from receiving religious education.The veil of repression and the potential for punishment has, exiled Tibetans say, created such anxiety that many refuse to even utter the name of the Dalai Lama, the Tibetan Buddhist spiritual and political leader.\"From an economic perspective, the CCP wants to extract resources, including water and minerals, to sustain other parts of China,\" surmised Cleo Paskal, non-resident senior fellow for the Indo-Pacific at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies (FDD). \"From a strategic perspective, it is moving in major infrastructure, military hardware, and troops to advance its territorial claims on its neighbors, including India.\"Early in the 20th century, Tibet \u2013 under the 13th and previous Dalai Lama \u2013 had its own currency, national flag, military, passports and diplomats. It remained neutral throughout the Second World War, but in 1950, the newly established communist regime in China under Mao Zedong invaded the land parcel, rich in natural resources and critical in its geography bordering India. The CCP claims Tibet has historically been \u2013 and remains \u2013 China, while Tibetans cling to their seeds of independence.Marion Smith, executive director of the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation (VOC), said,\u00a0\"The CCP has become much more clever at silencing voices in the West who dare to raise awareness about\u00a0Tibet, especially in Hollywood\u2014just ask Richard Gere.\"The American Hollywood star joined the board of directors at the International Campaign for\u00a0Tibet\u00a0in 1992 and passionately called for a boycott of the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games. He\u00a0claimed in a 2017  with the Hollywood Reporter that he was dropped from a number of blockbuster movies because China doesn't like him, and that studio films struggle get financing with his name attached.Brad Pitt was also once banned from China for having starred in the 1997 hit \"Seven Years in Tibet\" \u2013 although he visited the PRC in more recent years.However,\u00a0Chinese officials routinely note that over the past four decades, billions have been poured into Tibet to successfully lift it out of poverty, improve human rights and education, and invest in repairs to preserve Tibetan culture.Despite its disappearance from international diplomacy, Tibet is re-emerging in the widening rift between Washington and Beijing. Weeks before the consulate shutdown,\u00a0 Mike Pompeo warned that international access to the \"tightly controlled\" TAR was a matter of regional and environmental security, and banned from the U.S. several Chinese authorities who have barred that admittance.In response, China's foreign ministry announced similar sanctions and urged\u00a0the U.S. to \"stop interfering in China's internal affairs.\"That demand remains to be seen.\"What Congress needs to do now is pass the\u00a0. This bill will dramatically upgrade U.S. support for\u00a0Tibetans, including by sanctioning any Chinese officials who try to interfere in the succession of the Dalai Lama,\" Tsering added. \"This represents not only a grave violation of the rights of\u00a0Tibetan Buddhists but also a threat to religious freedom around the globe.\"", "comment": "(2,552)", "topic": "China", "date": " 5 days ago"}, {"cover": "https://a57.foxnews.com/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/694940094001/08b970e1-a9de-4a5e-923a-807a947ea6e7/c0d201e4-6b12-4ce8-8322-be55d5cd9f6a/1280x720/match/156/88/image.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "title": "China retaliates, closes Chengdu consulate", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/world/china-retaliates-closes-chengdu-consulate", "subtitle": "The U.S. has four other consulates in China and an embassy in Beijing", "keyword": "China and the world order", "website": "Fox News", "author": "", "content": "CHENGDU, China -- The U.S. closed its consulate in the southwestern city of Chengdu on Monday, a victim of the rising China ordered the mission closed late last week in retaliation for a U.S. order to shut down the Chinese Consulate in Houston earlier the same week.The tit-for-tat closings marked a significant escalation in the multiple disputes between the two countries over a range of issues, including trade, technology, security and human rights.A statement from the State Department said that the Chengdu consulate suspended operations at 10 a.m.\"The consulate has stood at the center of our relations with the people in Western China, including Tibet, for 35 years,\" the statement said. \"We are disappointed by the Chinese Communist Party's decision and will strive to continue our outreach to the people in this important region through our other posts in China.\"The U.S. has four other consulates in China and an embassy in Beijing.The American flag was taken down at the Chengdu mission at 6:18 a.m., China's state broadcaster CCTV said on its social media account.Police closed off a two- to three-block area around the consulate, cutting off virtually any view of the property including the flag.

It wasn't clear who or what was on the bus.Three medium-size trucks arrived and left a few hours later, and cars with diplomatic plates departed in between.The U.S. alleged that the Houston consulate was a nest of Chinese spies who tried to steal data from facilities in Texas, including the Texas A&M medical system and the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston.

Throughout her tenure, critics accused Khan of redirecting the human rights watchdog into fighting poverty and away from its original mandate centered on advocacy for prisoners of conscience. In 2011, she went on to become director-general of the Rome-based International Development Law Organization, which focuses on the rule of law and sustainable development, of which China is one of the eight state financiers.\"[Khan]\u00a0has a record of being a supporter of economic and social rights over political and civil liberties,\" noted Sean Roberts, director and associate professor of International Development Studies at the George Washington University. \"As such, it is likely that China is banking on the idea that she will continue this legacy at the U.N. and avoid highlighting freedom of speech issues related to the internal politics of any given country, including China.\"As chair of the five-nation Human Rights Council, which the U.S. withdrew from in 2018 at the behest of then-Ambassador Nikki Haley, China vetted and picked Khan out of 48 applicants to serve as the United Nations Special Rapporteur for freedom of expression and opinion, becoming the first woman to hold such a title.\"The Chinese government has been working hard to be a participant in as many of the U.N.'s initiatives as possible, both in terms of funding and engagement. At the same time, the United States is increasingly stepping back from the U.N., allowing China to take on an even greater role,\" Roberts underscored. \"And China's soft power globally, especially in the developing world, is on the rise at the same time as that of the U.S. is on the wane. Thus, China is able to get support from a lot of other U.N. member states to achieve its goals of more authority in the U.N.\"Roberts cautioned that while the U.N. \"has never been effective enough to live up to its lofty mission,\" it remains a dominant force in global politics.\"If the U.S. continues to retreat from its role in the organization and allows China to expand its power there, China's position as a global leader will inevitably be enhanced regardless of its respect for human rights,\" he said. \"Most of all, this threatens to deteriorate any power that the Universal Declaration of Human Rights still holds in the world.\"But Chinese leadership and control of international organizations extend well beyond the scope of the United Nations.The U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission (USCC) in April published an  identifying \"Chinese citizens serving in leadership positions in key international organizations: from U.N. principal organs, and U.N. funds and programs, to U.N. specialized agencies and international trade and financial institutions.All the while, concerns are being raised by the United States and other allies with regard\u00a0to the national security law that came into play inside the once autonomous  this month.The new law paves\u00a0the way for a national security committee to be formed in Hong Kong under the jurisdiction of Beijing, and it also means that those accused of anti-government offenses now can be tried\u00a0on the mainland and subject to significantly more stringent punishments.At the U.N. Human Rights Council, which was led this month by Cuba, 53 countries voted in support of China's heavy-handed clampdown with the justification that the people of Hong Kong could now \"exercise their freedom in a safe environment.\"Those who opposed the controversial law were considerably outnumbered, led by the U.K., but garnering the support of just 26 other countries.\"China is ascending in the U.N. because the U.N. provides an environment of corruption in which the Chinese Communist Party thrives. Consider that the , a part of the United Nations, praised the 'transparency' of the Chinese during the  when the Chinese government, in fact, censored and suppressed information,\" conjectured Will Coggin, managing director of the American Security Institute. \"Much as the U.S.  the WHO, we should consider whether it's worth continuing to spend $10 billion a year to fund the U.N. What does that money get us?\"Furthermore, Beijing's treatment and forced disappearance of more than a million Chinese minority Muslims, known as Uighurs, is also coming under increasingly blistering limelight.The U.S. has long spoken out against reports of mass concentration camps, unjustified allegations of terrorism and subsequent imprisonment\u00a0and torture of the minority group, which is mostly present in the Xinjiang region. And this week U.K. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab took a bold step in denouncing China for \"gross and egregious\" human rights abuses against its Uighur population and said sanctions against those responsible cannot be ruled out.Two years ago, as evidence of such camps was first exposed, China vehemently denied their existence. The government later admitted to their existence, vowing that they were \"reeducation\" institutions and a pivotal tool against terrorism.Nonetheless, even the United Nations' own independent human rights experts have conveyed outrage over the repression of \"fundamental freedom\" by the Chinese leadership as it continues to cement its place on the Council.In a joint  last month, some 50 experts bemoaned that they had \"repeatedly communicated\" their \"grave concerns,\" ranging from \"impunity for excessive use of force by police and the alleged use of chemical agents against protesters; to the alleged sexual harassment and assault of women protesters in police stations; together with the alleged harassment of health care workers\" in Hong Kong, along with the collective repression of specific communities \u2013 \"especially religious and ethnic minorities, in Xinjiang and Tibet\" \u2013 to the disappearances of human rights advocates across the country.The U.S. took matters into their own hands this week, imposing  on 11 additional\u00a0Chinese  over human rights violations against the Uighurs. The fallout will have a direct impact on several suppliers to major international brands such as Google, Apple, HP, Ralph Lauren\u00a0and Hugo Boss, which\u00a0have financial liaisons with the newly sanctioned companies.Whether there will be any change of course on China's part remains to be seen.", "comment": "(94)", "topic": "UNITED NATIONS", "date": " July 22"}, {"cover": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/156/88/china-organ-harvest-ap.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "title": "Activists push for investigation over claims China is forcibly harvesting organs of Uighur population", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/world/china-harvesting-organs-uighur-investigation", "subtitle": "For decades, the Chinese Communist Party depended on executed prisoners to bolster its organ transplant trade.

But immediately, suspicions were raised that the data was being used to ascertain who had the healthiest organs for \"donation.\"\"This selection was purely racial: over half of the population of Xinjiang, the Han Chinese, were exempt from the medical tests,\" Gutmann said.In a testimony provided to Fox News via the London-based World Uyghur Congress, Uighur gulag survivor Omer Bakari said he underwent his first round of forced blood and urine sample, along with an eye and full-body exam, at a Pichan police station in late March 2017. He said the following month\u00a0he was made to undergo a second exam at a hospital before \"being thrown\" into a Karmay prison where he was beaten with a whip and surrounded by others in the community who were left \"hanging like meat\" in cells. He suspects he was being tested as a potential candidate to be organ-plucked.Similarly, Gulbahar Jelilova, 46, stated that she was seized by Chinese authorities in May 2017 after traveling to Urumqi, the capital of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, to pick up a shipment of goods for her exporting business.She alleged that she was then coerced into making a false confession that she had transferred money to a Turkish company she had never even heard of, and pledged that throughout her 15-month incarceration the women were all given tablets that stopped their menstrual cycle, and that she\u00a0at one point early on was stripped naked for a medical examination.Canadian human rights lawyer David Matas, who has extensively studied the illicit organ harvesting issue, highlighted that at Kashgar airport in Xinjiang, there are even signs in various languages signifying the route for transporting organs to the aircraft for exportation abroad. Photographs  in September 2018 show \"priority lanes\" for this very purpose.Adding to the obscurity surrounding the possible targeting of the Uighur Muslims is the emergence of reports indicating that many who go to China for life-saving organs come from the wealthy Gulf States; thus the demand for \"halal\" organs \u2013 from bodies untouched by dietary choices such as pork and from those who have followed a diet in keeping with the tenants of Islam \u2013 are in demand.Gutmann asserted that while there are no known advertisements for \"halal organs,\" the phrase has become a useful shorthand for several pieces of evidence,\" which includes documentation of \"gulf state organ\u00a0tourists in Tianjin Central Hospital, the worlds largest transplant center.\"\"Go back a few years, and the foreign entrance to the hospital website politely asked if you preferred to continue in English or Arabic,\" he continued. \"More recently, at least one Chinese hospital openly advertises to the world that it has a very nice\u00a0Muslim prayer room and a halal restaurant.\"While experts say the most significant market is domestic, organ shoppers hail from\u00a0far and wide.\"The biggest customers are wealthy or politically connected local Chinese,\" Matas said. \"The biggest foreign customers are now Japanese, South Koreans, and Saudis.\"Salih Hudayar, prime minister of the East Turkistan Government in Exile, pointed out that \"Uighur prisoners have also been transferred to Heilongjiang Province near the Korean border; it is known that Korea is a big market for organs.\"But getting to the bottom of the matter is profoundly challenging for outside investigators, given the widespread suppression in Xianjing.More than one million Uighurs are estimated to be \"disappeared\" into concentration camps \u2013 what Beijing refers to as \"re-education camps\" and a necessary national security tool against Islamic extremism. Moreover, victims'\u00a0bodies are quickly disposed of \u2013 family members are typically told that their otherwise healthy loved one died suddenly and are under close supervision by authorities when they view and bury the body.Nonetheless, China has repeatedly denied the use of unethical organ transplant practices, maintaining that it stopped using the organs from executed prisoners in 2015.Officials have accused the China Tribunal of perpetuating \"rumors.\"Yet a probe published in the  journal in November accused China of \"systematic falsification and manipulation of official organ transplant datasets\" to obscure just how few voluntary donors had registered, compared to how many transplant surgeries occurred.Sometimes referred to as \"medical genocide\" by activists, the fast and furious transplant trade is estimated to make some $1 billion a year for the Beijing back pocket.\"One or two of China's hospitals could have matched the average of about 6,000 liver transplants performed annually in the entire United States since 2000,\" stated the U.S.-based , which claims to have combed through hundreds of transplant hospitals in China and their revenue, bed counts, bed utilization rates, surgical expertise, training programs, state funding and more, for its findings. \"While Chinese officials claim that the country performs about 10,000 transplants a year, this annual figure is easily surpassed by just a few hospitals. Based on government-imposed minimum capacity requirements, the 164 approved transplant hospitals could have conducted more than 70,000 transplants per year.\"Chinese medical authorities boast that the country performs the most transplants in the world \u2013 surpassing the 40,000 that happen annually in the U.S. \u2013 but the circumstance of its \"voluntary\" nature remains murky.\"Most Chinese are reluctant to donate their organs given their traditions, so we believe that forced organ harvesting is still continuing. We highly suspect that it is happening in East Turkistan due to the fact that many of the bodies of victims who died in the concentration camps and prisons haven't been returned to their families,\" noted Hudayar. \"In the instances that the bodies were returned their families, there were visible stitches on parts of the bodies like the kidneys.\"He also emphasized that thousands of Uighurs \"were secretly transferred to prisons inside Chinese provinces like Henan,\u00a0where there are five known Chinese hospitals\u00a0that have been implicated by researchers for being involved in organ harvesting.\"\"Given its record on religious freedom, we have no reason to trust Communist China's denials,\" contended Gary Bauer, commissioner for the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF). \"The government's lack of transparency is in itself very revealing.\u00a0Unfortunately, most victims of this outrageous practice die as a result, so they are not able to speak about their suffering.\"But despite grave concerns being voiced by the international community as it pertains to possible organ harvesting and the Uighurs, no country nor international agency is yet to actually take on a formal investigation and prosecutorial process.The U.S. State Department and the Chinese Embassy in Washington did not respond to further requests from Fox News for comment.", "comment": "(239)", "topic": "China", "date": " July 28"}, {"cover": "https://a57.foxnews.com/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/694940094001/54d56f1c-1d75-4146-a6bd-ffc1e378d19c/5a9df840-b7b3-4b58-aeba-502480bbd85b/1280x720/match/156/88/image.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "title": "Pompeo, State Department sharpen criticism of China on virus and rights abuses", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/politics/pompeo-state-department-sharpen-criticism-of-china-on-virus-and-rights-abuses", "subtitle": "Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and his department are stepping up attacks against China over the country's human rights abuses and handling of the coronavirus, barbs that come as observers around the world are outraged at Beijing's treatment of pro-democracy protesters and of Uyghur\u00a0Muslims.\u00a0", "keyword": "China and the world order", "website": "Fox News", "author": "Tyler Olson", "content": " Mike Pompeo and his department are stepping up attacks against  over the country's human rights abuses and handling of the , barbs that come as observers around the world are outraged at Beijing's treatment of pro-democracy protesters and Uyghur\u00a0Muslims.They also come during an election year and as President Trump is struggling to defend his administration's response to the coronavirus pandemic.The attacks are not new, but they represent a sharpened message on China from an administration whose messaging on the nation has run the gamut from harsh condemnation to effusive praise.\u00a0They have ranged from knocks on China for  information about the coronavirus to\u00a0\u00a0directed at American companies about working with Chinese brands due to their use of forced\u00a0labor;\u00a0from\u00a0 about China's actions in Hong Kong to condemnation for  \"the stain of the century\" of human rights violations.There have also been more general attacks, like one ominous Sunday night tweet from the State Department's official account.\"@SecPompeo: We are watching the world unite to come to understand the threat from the Chinese Communist Party,\" it reads.Pompeo, in a recent pair of speeches, has also taken explicit shots at China.\"China, in particular, is aggressively promoting a very different concept in which national priorities of various sorts prevail over the basic rights of speech, assembly, religious freedom, and free elections,\" Pompeo said Thursday at a speech about the State Department's efforts on \"unalienable rights.\"Pompeo made similar comments at the Family Leadership Summit the next day in Iowa.\"And inside China, just to give a single example, a few weeks back I read a report about the Chinese Communist Party forcing mass abortions and sterilization on Chinese Muslims in Western China,\" he said.\u00a0\"These are some of the most gross human rights violations we have seen and I\u2019ve referred to it as the stain of the century.\"He added: \"We\u2019ve called out China\u2019s war on faith. Its mass detention of Uyghurs, its godless decisions to replace church displays of the Ten Commandments with words from General Secretary Xi have not gone without being called out.\"Despite the recent tough talk, the administration has seemed to take a hodgepodge of stances on criticizing China, oftentimes depending on the issue. Trump has railed against China for taking advantage of the United States on trade deals since the 2016 campaign. But\u00a0he's often praised Chinese President Xi Jinping himself.Meanwhile, the U.S. has maintained a consistent message against China's claims in the South China Sea during the Trump administration, regularly executing freedom of navigation operations with U.S. Navy vessels. But Trump himself roiled Republicans last fall when he congratulated Xi on his country's 70th anniversary, refraining from any criticism of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).The Trump administration has sought to stymie the Chinese-controlled tech company Huawei from global 5G networks \u2014\u00a0something it just secured a major victory\u00a0at with the United Kingdom recently deciding to freeze Huawei out of its 5G infrastructure. But Trump, according to a memoir by his former National Security Adviser John Bolton, had indicated he personally didn't care about China's repression of ethnic minorities, specifically the Uyghur Muslims.\"At the opening dinner of the Osaka G20 meeting, with only interpreters present, Xi explained to Trump why he was basically building concentration camps in Xinjiang. According to our interpreter, Trump had said that Xi should go ahead with building the camps, which he thought was exactly the right thing to do,\" Bolton said. \"[Deputy National Security Advisor Matt] Pottinger told me Trump said something very similar during the 2017 trip to China, which meant we could cross repression of Uighurs off our list of possible reasons to sanction China, at least as long as trade negotiations continued.\"Trump and those in his administration have repeatedly condemned Bolton and his book, denying many of the allegations it contains.Now, amid the continuing fallout from the president's handling of the coronavirus pandemic, with Trump angrily deflecting blame for the virus toward China -- where it originated -- Pompeo and the State Department are putting rhetorical pressure on China with\u00a0renewed vigor.\"Countries that want to be global powers, countries that want to participate on the global stage, have a corresponding obligation to comply to the promises they make. China made a promise to the World Health Organization. There's a set of rules about disclosure, and when you have\u00a0 an incident in your country that could potentially lead to a pandemic, you have an obligation to report that and allow others co tome in and helo,\" Pompeo said in a video tweeted last week that was originally on The Hill's \"Virtually Live.\"The United States has withdrawn from the World Health Organization over its alleged compliance with China in covering up the coronavirus in its initial stages.Pompeo added: \"The Chinese Communist Party chose differently, they co-opted the World Health Organization to achieve that coverup, and the result today is that we have hundreds of thousands of people who have died and trillions of dollars in global damage as a direct result.\"Trump got at a similar point in an interview with \"Fox News Sunday.\"\"It came from China. They should've never let it escape. They should've never let it out,\" he said.Trump later continued: \"The World Health got a tremendous amount wrong. They basically did whatever China wanted them to. And we'll save now almost $500 million a year, which is nice. But the World Health got a lot wrong.\"China, meanwhile, has shot back in the diplomatic war of words, accusing the United States of mishandling the coronavirus and even at one point falsely accusing the U.S. Army of introducing the virus into China.\"The #US politicizes #COVID19 response at home and uses 'attacking China'\u00a0as a panacea for domestic problems. A real-life #HouseofCards\u00a0is on in #Washington, with people's lives at stake,\" Hua Chunying, a  for the country's foreign ministry, said in a tweet last week.It's unclear where U.S.-China relations could go from this increasingly hostile juncture, with another grand trade deal, cooperation on North Korea or reconciliation on geopolitical claims in East Asia looking increasingly unlikely. But any kind of military conflict still appears far-fetched, and\u00a0neither nation appears poised to institute new tariffs on the other -- private businesses in both countries continue to work in the other, with American businesses like the NBA still reluctant to even  China's human rights abuses, let alone take any action or make any statements on the matter.For now, tit-for-tat sanctions appear to be as far as either country will go, with Trump this month signing the Hong Kong Autonomy Act, a bill to sanctions Chinese entities that have contributed to eroding the freedoms once enjoyed in Hong Kong and financial institutions that do business with them. The\u00a0executive branch also announced sanctions in relation to the oppression of the Uyghur Muslims.Meanwhile, China\u00a0sanctioned some U.S. individuals, including Republican Sens. Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio. Cruz, a close ally of the administration, echoed the rhetoric from Pompeo in his response.\"Unfortunately for CCP leaders, I don't have plans to travel to the authoritarian regime that covered up the coronavirus pandemic and endangered millions of lives worldwide,\" Cruz said in a statement that also condemned\u00a0the \"horrific forced abortions and sterilizations\" of the Uyghur Muslims.", "comment": "(666)", "topic": "State Department", "date": " July 20"}, {"cover": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/07/156/88/308a6149-image-48.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "title": "Pompeo says China 'was aware' of human coronavirus transmission before telling world, WHO was 'co-opted'", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/media/mike-pompeo-china-coronavirus-human-transmission-who", "subtitle": "Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told \"Bill Hemmer Reports\" Thursday that the Chinese government \"was\u00a0aware of human-to-human\u00a0transmission\" of the coronavirus \"before they shared this with the world.\"", "keyword": "China and the world order", "website": "Fox News", "author": "Charles Creitz", "content": " Mike Pompeo told \"\" Thursday that the Chinese government \"was\u00a0aware of human-to-human\u00a0transmission\" of the  \"before they shared this with the world.\"Hemmer had asked Pompeo to comment on claims by Hong Kong-based virologist Dr. Yan Li-Meng, who recently fled to the United States, that\u00a0Beijing knew that the virus could spread between humans three weeks before that knowledge was made public.Pompeo added Thursday that \"the World Health Organization\u00a0itself was co-opted into the\u00a0same effort to deny the world the knowledge it needed to respond\u00a0to this threat, to this threat from the virus\u00a0that emanated from Wuhan, China.\"The secretary of state joined Hemmer a day after telling\u00a0\u00a0during a virtual summit that he believes the rest of the world will make China \"pay a price\" for their mishandling of the initial outbreak.\"I can see nations who are\u00a0doing\u00a0business in China who are\u00a0rethinking about how to do that,\" he told Hemmer Thursday.\u00a0\"If you are buying products that\u00a0are a result of the slave labor\u00a0that's happening in the western part\u00a0of China, if you're a country that's\u00a0bent the knee to China because they tried to come\u00a0fish in your waters that are rightly yours ...\u00a0I can see nations\u00a0all around the world that are reasserting their\u00a0claims, their sovereignty.\"And of course President Trump's done that here too,\" Pompeo added.\u00a0\"For 40 years -- this isn't partisan, Bill --\u00a0for 40 years, we've had administrations\u00a0that have just looked the other way\u00a0and allowed\u00a0China to trample on us.

Furthermore, the vast array of transplantable organ types and their prices openly listed on hospital websites give the impression that any body part can be replaced as needed.\u201dLin also noted that even though the China Tribunal final judgment came out in March 2020, the WHO has not responded to it.The  journal last November also accused the CCP of falsifying data and covering up illegal extraction on vulnerable minorities and political prisoners.The  has been asked to launch an investigation into the allegations, but it has not, and the WHO\u00a0has not looked into\u00a0any potential criminal activity.Instead, it\u00a0lavished praise on China\u2019s organ donation program despite its soiled history and the ongoing skepticism surrounding its modus operandi.At the 27th\u00a0International Congress of the Transplantation Society in Spain, Dr. Jose Nunez, who oversees global organ transplantation data collection for the WHO,\u00a0 the accusations pertaining to organ harvesting in China as \u201crumors.\u201d In a September 2017 interview with the Washington Post, he\u00a0vowed that the number of foreigners going to China for transplants was \u201creally very low,\u201d compared with other countries and that\u00a0Beijing had reformed.Months after the China Tribunal released its preliminary findings revealing\u00a0organ harvesting,\u00a0Nunez reportedly\u00a0told  that the country\u2019s \u201corgan transplant reform has achieved remarkable results in a short period.\u00a0China's experience can serve as a model for the entire Asian region and the world.\"Similarly, last December, Dr. Francis L. Delmonico, the former president of The Transplantation Society (TTS), the chief medical officer of the New England Organ Bank (NEOB)\u00a0and chair of the WHO Task Force on donation and transplantation of human organs and tissues, reportedly\u00a0: \"The biggest feature of the Chinese experience in organ transplantation is the strong support from the Chinese government, which is an example that many countries should follow.\u201dDr. Edward Kelley, director of the Department of Service Provision and Security at the WHO headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland, echoed\u00a0the praise.\u00a0According to China\u2019s , he stated China and other countries participating in the meeting are \u201cglobal models in the field of organ transplantation.\u201dA year earlier, the WHO \u2013 along with TTS\u00a0in Canada and the Vatican\u2019s Pontifical Academy of Science \u2013 co-hosted the Summit Against Organ Trafficking, in which China\u2019s Dr. Huang Jiefu was controversially invited as a  to present\u00a0\u201cChina\u2019s model\u201d on organ transplantation practice.\u201cThen, at the 70th\u00a0World Health Assembly (WHA) on May 2017, China representatives proposed WHO to establish a specific task force on organ transplantation,\u201d Lin pointed out. \u201cThen in March 2018, driven by the Chinese government, WHO Task Force on Donation & Transplantation of Human Organs and Tissues was formally established.\u201d Delmonico became one of the two chairmen of this task force and two Chinese doctors,\u00a0Huang Jiefu and Wang Haibo,\u00a0serve as members.The task force has \u00a0transplantation as a \u201cform of treatment that is nowadays acknowledged as the best and frequently the only life-saving therapy for end-stage organ failure.\u201dThe WHO did not immediately respond to a request for comment on allegations about Chinese organ transplants or whether any further investigation will be undertaken, but its stance in recent years has perplexed many activists and experts.\u201cWe know that organ harvesting affects especially religious minorities like Uighurs, Tibetans, the Falun Gong, Christian pastors, and other political dissidents and persons who are members of politically sensitive groups, according to the Chinese people. The CCP will stop at nothing to silence its critics,\u201d added Olivia Enos, a senior policy analyst and Asian studies expert at The Heritage Foundation.\u201cAny promises that the CCP will stop organ harvesting ring hollow.

Its power operation went online in 2012, and it is one of China\u2019s most expensive and questionable developmental projects.Some 1.4 million people had to be resettled as a result of the .The dam also was  along the Yangtze and provide power for China's industrial boom. But some geologists contended that damming up too much water in the reservoir carried a heightened risk of earthquakes and prolonged damage to the river's ecology.In 2012, the Ministry of Land Resources  around the reservoir had\u00a0increased 70 percent after the water level in the $23 billion project rose to its maximum in 2010.Critics of the project, like Chinese geologist Fan Xiao, have said that Three Gorges and other major dam projects may make flooding worse by altering the flow of sedimentation down the river. He  that at Three Gorges, the storage capacity amounts to less than 9 percent of average floodwaters.\u201cIt can only partially and temporarily intercept the upstream floods, and is powerless to help with floods caused by heavy rainfall in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River,\u201d he said.Damage from this season's floods has been estimated in the hundreds of millions of dollars, further pressuring an economy deeply impacted by the coronavirus pandemic.Hubei province, through which the Yangtze flows, is known for its numerous lakes and rivers and is under particular threat. The province's capital Wuhan was the epicenter of China's coronavirus outbreak.On Friday, a resident in Wuhan south of the dam posted a video showing that the Yangtze River was well above average, even though it hadn't rained recently, .Residents in the Yangtze River basin in recent weeks have expressed concerns over the ability of the massive dam to handle more heavy rain, even though authorities have been releasing floodwater from the structure.State media said last week that since June 29, the outflow of the Three Gorges Dam has been controlled at an average daily rate of 35,000 cubic meters\u00a0per second, reducing up to 30 percent of the Yangtze's peak discharge. that it \"effectively relieved the pressure of flood control on the middle and lower reaches of the river.\"Chinese state media dismissed concerns as being \"hyped by some Western media,\" claiming the dam is able to meet a \u00a0\"once-in-a-millennium\" water level at 175 meters or flow up to 70,000 cubic meters per second.The company running the Three Gorges Project said on Saturday that downstream water discharges had been halved since July 6, \u201ceffectively reducing the speed and extent of water level rises on the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze.\u201dThe total amount of stored floodwater had now reached 88 percent of the reservoir\u2019s total capacity, it added.But critics of the controversial project are still skeptical.\"With hindsight, I think that all those experts who opposed the building\u00a0of the Three Gorges were right,\" Zhang Jianping, an activist in Jiangsu, said on Radio Free Asia. \"Since it was built, it has never played a role in preventing flooding or droughts, like we thought it would back then.\"", "comment": "(662)", "topic": "Floods", "date": " July 15"}, {"cover": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/07/156/88/AP20211466009708.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "title": "Vatican, Hong Kong diocese allegedly hacked by China ahead of landmark talks", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/world/vatican-hong-kong-diocese-allegedly-hacked-by-china-ahead-of-landmark-talks", "subtitle": "The Vatican and the Catholic Diocese of Hong Kong have been the targets of alleged Chinese state-backed hackers ahead of talks on renewal of a landmark 2018 deal that helped thaw diplomatic relations between the Vatican and China, according to a monitoring group.", "keyword": "China and the world order", "website": "Fox News", "author": "", "content": "The  and the Catholic Diocese of  have been the targets of alleged  state-backed hackers ahead of talks on renewal of a landmark 2018 deal that helped thaw diplomatic relations between the Vatican and China, according to a monitoring group.The alleged attacks by a group called RedDelta began in May with an eye on September talks to renew a provisional agreement on bishop appointments, according to a report Tuesday by the U.S.-based Recorded Future, which tracks state-backed cyber attacks.

Underground priests and parishioners are frequently detained and harassed.A landmark 2018 deal between the Holy See and China on bishop nominations was aimed at uniting the flock, regularizing the status of seven bishops who were not recognized by Rome and thawing decades of estrangement between China and the Vatican.But some of China\u2019s underground faithful have deep reservations about the deal, seeing it as a sell-out to the Communist government and a betrayal of their long loyalty to the pope.China routinely denies engaging in a state-sponsored program to steal commercial secrets or sensitive government information over the internet, and says it is among the biggest victims of hacking attacks. The U.S. disputes that and says it has traced cyber intrusions to the Chinese military.

This action is intended to send the world a message: Fear us.The free  response should be to man up.Beijing\u2019s action came after recent U.S. legislation calling for sanctions on Chinese officials over their systematic abuse of the Uighurs and other Muslim minorities. We\u2019re talking about systematic and horrific  violations, including the mass detention of over a million Chinese citizens, religious persecution, exploitation of slave labor and forced sterilization.Last week, these inhumane practices led the Trump administration to impose sanctions on four individuals, including Politburo member Chen Quanguo, the highest-ranking Chinese official ever called out by Washington. Chen is also Party secretary of Xinjiang Province, where the Uighur detention camps are located.\u00a0The other three officials sanctioned are also tied to Xinjiang.China announced its \u201c\u201d on Monday. Three of those targeted are Sens. Ted Cruz,\u00a0R-Texas,\u00a0and Marco Rubio,\u00a0R-Fla.,\u00a0and Rep. Chris Smith,\u00a0R-N.J., who led the legislative efforts to punish Beijing. Also named by Beijing were U.S. Ambassador for International Religious Freedom Sam Brownback and members of the Congressional-Executive Commission on China.This is not just Beijing playing tit-for-tat with Washington. The Chinese action comes on the heels of  that significantly restricts the economic and political freedoms long enjoyed by the people of Hong Kong. The Chinese regime has also engaged in an aggressive diplomatic and propaganda effort during the COVID-19 crisis, evading responsibilities for its own failures, while threatening other nations for not siding with China.The highly hostile approach now being pursued by Beijing is popularly called \u201cwolf warrior\u201d diplomacy. The moniker refers to a series of Chinese films in which a Rambo-like character runs around the world thwarting \u201cevil\u201d capitalist designs.The real question is whether wolf warrior diplomacy is an act of strength or weakness. After all, the Soviet Union unveiled their Rambo-esque character in a film which premiered less than four years before the evil empire collapsed.But no matter whether it driven by insecurity or overconfidence, China\u2019s increasingly intimidating stance is a problem the United States will have to deal with.America\u2019s response ought to focus on the target for Beijing\u2019s temper tantrum \u2014 and it is probably not America. In practice, China has had no luck bullying this administration. From increasing freedom of navigation operations in the South China Seas to upping support for Taiwan, action on trade and calling out Beijing\u2019s abuse of the World Health Organization, when Beijing has pushed, the U.S. has pushed back harder.America can get away with bumping heads with Beijing. We are a superpower.China\u2019s sanctions aren\u2019t so much designed to push against an immovable geo-political object as they are trying to flow around U.S. power and intimidate others. There is little likelihood, they\u2019ll ever try to extradite Cruz or Rubio.\u00a0No, they want to send a message to others.Kicking sand in the face of American officials is the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s not-so-subtle warning that they are willing to go after anyone who gets in their way \u2014 and the weaker and meeker their opponents are, the harder China will squeeze.When it comes to battling wolf warrior diplomacy, the free world has to stand together. Otherwise China will use its divide-and-overwhelm strategy to pick the free world apart.Standing together will require American leadership, and it deserves strong, bipartisan support here at home. This is an issue where contemporary Washington politics of \u201cif Trump is for it, we are against it\u201d must be put aside. If we can\u2019t pull together on this one, we can\u2019t lead.Next, we are going to have to tell our friends and allies the hard truth: a country that wants to be part of the free world must stand with the free world in pushing back China\u2019s destabilizing actions that undermine our security, prosperity and values. They are going to have to carry their fair share of the load.Finally, we have to make the free world stronger. The tougher we are to take out, the more likely China is to back down. We have to recommit to collective defense. We have to partner in jumpstarting our economies so we can recover faster and stronger after the COVID-19 crisis.

More than 2,000 passengers from the same administrative zones arrived in March and an additional 150 in April, according to The AP report.There is no sufficient evidence to show people from these flights transmitted the coronavirus, but the National Security Council, the State Department, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) would not publicly comment on why these\u00a0territories were exempt from the China travel ban.One administration official told The AP\u00a0that the travel ban was instated after more than 12,000 people arrived in the U.S. through the two territories in January, according to Commerce records. The Trump administration said it would also require any Americans who have traveled through China and back into the U.S. to undergo a 14-day quarantine period.But according to data collected by The Associated Press, the system that was meant to track and monitor the people undergoing quarantine lost track of at least\u00a01,600 Americans.Trump has touted his border closures, first from China, then European nations and\u00a0Brazil, as the U.S.\u2019s first line of defense against the coronavirus.In a tweet last week. the president said:\u00a0\u201cWe did a great job on Coronavirus, including the very early ban on China.\u201d\u201cWe saved millions of U.S. lives!

The law gives police greater power to crack down on any activity there that authorities deem subversive with secessionist aims.Trump added that the State Department's travel advisory for Hong Kong would be revised to reflect the increased danger of surveillance and punishment by the Chinese.

The court documents contained similar evidence against several other Chinese scientists.Chen Song, for example,\u00a0was an \"active duty People's Liberation Army\u00a0military scientist who lied to get into the United States, attempted to destroy evidence\u00a0and lied extensively to the FBI when interviewed,\" the government wrote in charging documents.\"Defendant\u2019s case is not an isolated one, but instead appears to be part of a program conducted by the PLA\u2014and specifically, FMMU or associated institutions\u2014to send military scientists to the United States on false pretenses with false covers or false statements about their true employment,\" the FBI said, referring to Chen Song. Another case involves a suspected spy working for UCSF.Meanwhile, the United States ordered China to close its consulate in Houston, escalating tensions between the world\u2019s largest economies as President Trump has ramped up punitive measures against China ahead of the November U.S. election. Beijing denounced the order Wednesday as \"outrageous\" and claimed it would draw a firm response if not reversed.The physical closure of the consulate, one of China's six missions in the United States, marked a dramatic step in increasingly contentious relations that have been strained not only by the coronavirus pandemic but also by disputes over trade, human rights, Hong Kong and Chinese assertiveness in the South China Sea.Previous Trump administration measures against Chinese officials, students and researchers have included travel bans, registration requirements and other steps intended to reduce the country's footprint in the United States. The administration also has announced its outright rejection of virtually all Chinese maritime claims in the South China Sea.These actions have come as Trump has sought to blame China for the coronavirus outbreak in the U.S., where cases have soared. Trump himself said more closures could be coming if China didn't change its behavior. \"It's always possible,\" he told reporters at the White House.The State Department announced it ordered the consulate closed within 72 hours after alleging that Chinese agents have tried to steal data from facilities in Texas, including the Texas A&M medical system statewide and The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston.There were indications consulate staff were preparing to leave: Papers were being burned on the consulate grounds late Tuesday night \u2014 a common practice when a diplomatic post is being shuttered on short notice.Cai Wei, the Chinese consul general, told KTRK-TV in Houston the order to shut down was \"quite wrong\" and \"very damaging\" to U.S.-China relations.Asked about accusations of espionage and stealing data, Cai said, \"You have to give some evidence, say something from the facts. ... Knowing Americans, you have the rule of law, you are not guilty until you are proved guilty.\"State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus said in a statement that the closure was \"to protect American intellectual property and Americans' private information.\"\"The United States will not tolerate (China's) violations of our sovereignty and intimidation of our people, just as we have not tolerated (China's) unfair trade practices, theft of American jobs, and other egregious behavior,\" she said.Testifying before Congress on Wednesday, Deputy Secretary of State Stephen Biegun lamented that relations today have been \"weighed down by a growing number of disputes,\" including commercial espionage, intellectual property theft and unequal treatment of diplomats, businesses and journalists.Those factors led to Trump's action, he told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.The Justice Department on Tuesday had announced the indictments of two Chinese hackers on charges of trying to steal pharmaceutical secrets from U.S. companies related to the COVID-19 pandemic that originated in China. Although there was no indication the indictments and the consulate action were related, the U.S. has long alleged China has been involved in nefarious activity around the country, including from its Houston consulate.Even before the U.S. announced the closure, which was conveyed privately to the Chinese ambassador on Tuesday, China strongly condemned it.\"The unilateral closure of China\u2019s consulate general in Houston within a short period of time is an unprecedented escalation of its recent actions against China,\" Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said. He warned of firm countermeasures if the U.S. did not reverse itself.Wang accused the U.S. of opening Chinese diplomatic pouches without permission multiple times, confiscating Chinese items for official use and imposing restrictions on Chinese diplomats beginning last October and again in June. He also said U.S. diplomats in China engaged in infiltration activities.In Houston, firefighters responded to reports of papers being burned on the consulate grounds Tuesday night but were barred entry. On Wednesday afternoon, consulate staff could be seen loading cleaning supplies and paper products into a van parked outside the building. A U-Haul truck was also parked outside the consulateFirst responders \"were told that people inside the consulate, that they were burning paperwork because they were in the process of being evacuated from the building,\" Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner said.Foreign diplomatic missions have operated under legal immunities accorded by international law and may not be entered without permission. However, the destruction of confidential documents at a facility that has been ordered or otherwise forced to close on short notice, including U.S. missions, was not unusual. Most recently in the United States, Russia's consulate in San Francisco made news for burning large amounts of material when it was ordered closed in 2017.Aside from the diplomatic ramifications, the closure of the Houston consulate could make it more difficult for China to provide assistance to its citizens in the southern United States and for U.S. nationals seeking visas and other services there.In addition to its embassy in Washington and its mission to the United Nations in New York, China has\u00a0consulates in New York, Chicago and Los Angeles. In an apparent bid to stave off the reciprocal closure of an American diplomatic mission in China, the State Department told the Chinese that it would not reopen its consulate in Wuhan, two U.S. officials who were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly told The Associated Press anonymously.The U.S. consulate in Wuhan was shuttered in late January at the height of the coronavirus outbreak that started there, but the State Department had informed Congress in early June that it planned to reopen it, possibly this summer.Besides Wuhan, the U.S. has four other consulates in China \u2014 in Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chengdu and Shenyang \u2014 along with its embassy in Beijing and a consulate general in Hong Kong.In a reflection of China\u2019s economic importance, a Houston business group expressed regret at the announcement, saying the consulate has been important in building trade, investment and cultural ties. It noted that the Houston consulate was China\u2019s first in the U.S. when it opened in 1979.", "comment": "", "topic": "China", "date": " July 22"}, {"cover": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/07/156/88/05_AP20197400984107.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "title": "China sees spike in COVID-19 cases 6 months after WHO declares coronavirus a health emergency", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/world/china-sees-spike-in-covid-19-cases-6-months-after-who-declares-coronavirus-a-health-emergency", "subtitle": "China on Thursday said it still has more than 18,000 people stuck in quarantine amid a spike\u00a0in COVID-19 cases across the country.\u00a0", "keyword": "China and the world order", "website": "Fox News", "author": "Barnini Chakraborty", "content": " on Thursday said it still has more than 18,000 people stuck in quarantine amid a spike\u00a0in  cases across the country.The admission comes six months\u00a0after the novel coronavirus was declared a global health emergency by the .

At least one shipment was sent to a medical supply company in Georgia from a factory in China\u2019s Hubei Province, where more than 100 Uighur workers were assigned, according to . The work transfer program involves shipping Uighur workers from their homes in the Xinjiang region to factories and other service jobs. They are required to learn Mandarin and pledge their allegiance to China at weekly flag-raising ceremonies.Before the pandemic struck, just four companies in Xinjiang made medical-grade protective equipment, according to China\u2019s National Medical Products Administration. By June 20, at least 51 companies in the region produced medical-grade PPE. Of those 51, at least 17 participated in the state-run labor program involving Uighur workers, the Times reported, citing state media reports and public records. Chinese state-run media has publicized the program as helping to lift Uighurs from poverty by giving them a form of employment and eliminating religious extremism. But penalties and quotas imposed by the Chines government suggest that participation in the program is involuntary.This comes as British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab on Sunday accused Beijing of \u201cgross and egregious\u201d human rights abuses against its Uighur population in China\u2019s western province of Xinjiang.\u00a0Raab said that while Britain wants good relations with China, it could not stand by amid reports of forced sterilization and mass education camps targeting the Uighur population in Xinjiang.\u201cIt is clear that there are gross, egregious human rights abuses going on.

Since then, it has sent astronauts to an experimental space station, begun work on a larger, more permanent facility and landed a probe on the less-explored far side of the moon.This summer\u2019s trio of missions in the most sweeping effort yet to seek signs of ancient microscopic life while scouting out Mars for future astronauts.The timelines for such missions are daunting and the countries involved are striving to take best advantage of a one-month window in which Mars and Earth are in ideal alignment on the same side of the sun, minimizing travel time and fuel use. Such a window opens only once every 26 months.Preparations have continued amid the coronavirus outbreak, which in part prompted Europe and Russia to drop their plans to send a life-seeking rover to Mars this summer.Each spacecraft will travel more than 480 million kilometers (300 million miles) before reaching Mars next February. In the process, they will loop out beyond Earth\u2019s orbit and sync up with Mars\u2019 more distant orbit around the sun.The U.S. is sending over a car-sized six-wheeled rover named Perseverance to collect rock samples to be returned to Earth for analysis in about a decade.

It will be the Arab world\u2019s first interplanetary mission.Scientists want to know what Mars was like billions of years ago, back when it had water sources that may have supported tiny life forms before turning into the frozen world it is today.So far, the U.S. has been the only country to successfully put a spacecraft on Mars, doing it eight times. Two NASA landers are operating there, InSight and Curiosity. Six other spacecraft are exploring the planet from orbit: three U.S., two European and one from India.China\u2019s last attempt at a Mars mission in collaboration with Russia ended in failure in 2011.

But in truth, it would demolish both justice and society,\u201d the president said. \u201cIt would transform justice into an instrument of division and vengeance and turn our free society into a place of repression, domination and exclusion. They want to silence us, but we will not be silenced.\u201dThis celebration at the memorial known as the Shrine to Democracy could not have come at a better time.Our democratic values are being challenged by increasingly intolerant radicals. These leftists misrepresent our history and seek to impose socialism and censorship on those who disagree. As we have seen over the last two months, the radical left is prepared to do this through mob rule and violence.Despite the insistence by the left and the mainstream media that our nation is hopelessly unjust, the United States is an ever-improving great experiment. The vast majority of Americans know this. So does the rest of the world, which is why the United States is by far the leading  for immigrants.Billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk, who was born in South Africa, expressed this in an interview this year about his phenomenal success: \u201cAmerica is the land of opportunity \u2013 there is no other country where I could have done this.\u201dBut the American experiment is fragile.On the final day of the Constitutional Convention in 1787, Benjamin Franklin, was asked: \u201cWhat do we have, a republic or a monarchy?\u201d He replied: \u201cA republic, if you can keep it.\u201dAlthough most Americans reject the radical leftist attacks on our country and history, the views of the extremists will take root unless we forcefully refute them.This means not just rejecting the recent lawlessness led by radical leftist groups like Black Lives Matters (BLM) and Antifa, but actively speaking out to defend our history of freedom. This must include keeping the left\u2019s America-hating, socialist narrative out of our schools.We live in a dangerous world with enemies who would like to end the American experiment and our status as the world\u2019s superpower.Russia tried to interfere in the 2016 presidential election. It will try to do so again this year, along with other nations, especially China.America\u2019s adversaries are encouraging BLM and Antifa to undermine our country. China is openly  BLM to bash the U.S. government and discredit liberal democracies to deflect criticism of Chinese human rights violations.America faces growing international security threats, including the coronavirus pandemic.Russia and China are expanding and improving their nuclear arsenals while America struggles to keep up.North Korea has not ended its nuclear and ballistic missile programs.Iran continues to develop its missile program and likely has robust clandestine nuclear weapons.The threat from radical Islamist terrorism continues and these terrorist groups likely are planning more potent attacks.China is and likely will remain the most serious security threat to the United States and the world. China\u2019s ruling Communist Party is not interested in peaceful co-existence or free and fair trade.Beijing is using diplomatic, military, economic, cyber, and espionage pressure and tools to supplant the United States as the global superpower and install a Chinese-led, anti-democratic world order.China has taken advantage of diverted American attention due to the coronavirus pandemic and violent protests to intensify its efforts to claim the South China Sea as part of its territory and crush what was left of Hong Kong\u2019s democracy.Fortunately, we have a president who recognizes foreign threats and is taking steps to defend our security and freedom. President Trump has built up and modernized our military, greatly improving readiness.The 2018 Nuclear Posture Review is a strategy this administration has acted on to modernize the U.S. nuclear arsenal after years of neglect.The Trump administration destroyed the ISIS state in Syria and Iraq and used military strikes to punish Syria for using chemical weapons against its people.President Trump ended President Barack Obama\u2019s appeasement of Iran by exiting the flawed 2015 nuclear deal.Trump also has called China out on its exploitative trade practices and intellectual property theft, using tariffs to press for free and fair trade. The U.S. and China agreed to a \u201cPhase One\u201d trade deal in January that addressed some of these concerns. Trump officials plan to open talks on a broader \u201cPhase Two\u201d deal if Trump wins reelection.The winner of the 2020 presidential election should continue and build upon these policies.As we celebrate the birth of our nation this weekend, we honor an exceptional nation that is a global beacon of freedom, liberty and opportunity.

Hope you're having a safe and healthy Fourth of July weekend. I'm Charles Payne, in for Maria Bartiromo. Coming up on \"Sunday Morning Futures\": (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: The courage of those patriots on July 4, 1776 -- the American republic stands today as the greatest, most exceptional and most virtuous nation in the history of the world. (END VIDEO CLIP) PAYNE: President Trump paying tribute to the founding fathers during last night's Salute to America celebration. And with less than four months to go until the election, why the president is calling mail-in voting his biggest concern heading into November. We will hear from U.S. Attorney General Bill Barr on why he says American companies with ties to China are putting short-term profits over long-term viability. Plus: Tennessee setting another single-day record for the new coronavirus cases. Senator Marsha Blackburn joins me to discuss the debate over mask mandates and whether states moved too quickly to reopen, as infection rates spike across the country. And analysis from Gordon Chang on the reasons behind China's newly passed national security law for Hong Kong. All that and more, as we look ahead on \"Sunday Morning Futures.\" The president coming out with a strong defense of U.S. history, while taking aim at the -- quote -- \"radical left\" during a Salute to America celebration, which included a trip to Mount Rushmore and a speech on the White House lawn on July 4. For reaction, let's bring in Republican Senator Marsha Blackburn from Tennessee, who serves on the Armed Services Committee, Commerce, and Judiciary committees. Senator, thanks for joining us. I just want to get your thoughts on those speeches, again, a serious focus on where America has come from, those who helped build America into the greatest country in the world, and a positive look to the future for all Americans. SEN. MARSHA BLACKBURN (R-TN): Oh, Charles, I thought the speech was absolutely one of the best that he has given. And how appropriate that he reminded the American people that we are unique, and that you can bet on hope, or you can bet on fear, but, in this country, you have the ability to do whatever you want to do, to dream those big dreams, and make them come true. And you and I have talked in times past about how we have each put a focus on encouraging young people from underserved areas. And wouldn't it be fabulous to have this national garden, where people could go and be inspired and say, I want to do something that is going to be significant for my country? PAYNE: Yes, it's interesting, because the White House just announcing that they do have plans for a national garden that could possibly open July 4, 2026. The media taking shots, saying it was an arbitrary and random list of Americans. I'm not sure what's so random about John Adams, Susan B. Anthony, Henry Clay, Daniel Boone, Davy Crockett, Franklin Doug -- Frederick Douglass, Amelia Earhart, Martin Luther King Jr., Abraham Lincoln, Douglas MacArthur, Betsy Ross, Harriet Beecher Stowe, Ronald Reagan, Jackie Robinson, Booker T. Washington, Harriet Tubman, George Washington, the Wright brothers, and the list goes on. That sounds like a pretty good list and a pretty good foundation of what shaped and formed who we are today. BLACKBURN: I think it's a great foundation, because you know what? Those of us that studied history and appreciate history can tick through you the list and tell you something of significance that each of those individuals did or said that inspired us in some way. So, as they are putting this list together, I think it is really wonderful. And how appropriate. You're talking about Frederick Douglass and Susan B. Anthony, and this is the year we're celebrating the 19th Amendment and women getting the right to vote. That is going to be August 18, 2020, the centennial celebration. PAYNE: And the speech itself, particularly the one at Mount Rushmore, when the president said that the founding fathers launched a revolution in pursuit of justice, equality, liberty, and prosperity, it kind of reminded me of \"Hamilton,\" right? The biggest media event over the weekend is how many people have watched \"Hamilton.\" And the same folks that said that this is an amazing play, with an inspiring message, found racism, division in these kind of words from President Trump. So, I just can't understand why, at some point, even the media should let their guards down, and let Americans celebrate where we have come and how we have gotten here so fast. BLACKBURN: That is so true. And we want to make certain -- and the president spoke to this. We do not need to erase our nation's history. It is all there, the good, the bad, the ugly, the inspirational, the achievement, the overcoming, the pride that people should take in the fact that they have been able to achieve and do and be. There are millions of people from all across the globe that seek to come to the United States every single year, because they are escaping oppression and because they want to be able to achieve their dreams. And they have read about our land as a land of hope and opportunity and freedom. So, they choose to come here. I think the garden is a great idea. The president's speech was the right tone, talking about this country and this country's achievements and the achievements of our people, which is what makes which makes -- which makes our country great. You know, people felt like President Trump believed in them in 2016. Indeed, he did. PAYNE: Right. BLACKBURN: And he has proven that, and so now to say, here is where we can go with our children and grandchildren and say, this is someone who made a difference in our lives. PAYNE: Senator, I want to switch gears here a little bit. BLACKBURN: Sure. PAYNE: COVID-19 cases have been on the rise throughout the nation. And I think the most recent numbers from Tennessee show a continuing spike in those cases. So, the idea is, what do we do? We do see where masks are now being mandatory in many states that they weren't before. BLACKBURN: Yes. PAYNE: Did we open too quickly? Or was it just sort of a situation where people just were so -- have been so pent up, so cooped up, that they overindulged there. And how long do you think it will get before we're sort of back on track with reopening the nation? BLACKBURN: I think getting back on track very quickly. And here is the reason why. You are seeing people who got out there, their kids got out there, they went to protest, they went into these groups. And now what do you have? You have spikes, whether it was protests or bars or whatever. So, I have talked to a lot of moms who are saying, I have told my kids and my young adults... (LAUGHTER) BLACKBURN: ... you have to wear a mask. You have to wash your hands. PAYNE: Yes. BLACKBURN: And they know they want to get out and about. And, Charles, here's the thing. We cannot afford another lockdown in this economy -- 4.8 million jobs, the jobs report, the numbers were good. People want to go to work. They need to do it safely. They need to wear their masks. They need to wear gloves, use a face shield if they need to. They need to wash their hands. And they need to make certain that their children are -- and even if they're adults, make certain that their children are doing these same things... PAYNE: Yes. BLACKBURN: ... their grandchildren are doing it, because kids have got to get back to school. And kids have got to get back to colleges. If you are not putting kids back in colleges, you don't have young teachers coming along to help teach children. You don't have young medical students getting through medical school and then getting out to do those of residencies and practice medicine. We have to get ourselves back on track. And here's another thing, Charles. We do not want to hand the keys of this economy that is roaring back to life, we don't want to hand those keys to the Marxists and the socialists. PAYNE: We have got less than a minute to go. And I know you're passionate about these two topics. I don't know if we can give answers on both. But, of course, you share President Trump's worries about mail-in voting and the fraud associated with that. BLACKBURN: Yes. PAYNE: But something else that you have been working on with the NCAA, the NIL, name, images and likeness, you have pushed hard for this. And it looks like these student athletes are going to start having some control over their own financial futures because of who they are. BLACKBURN: When it comes to NIL, yes, I think that we have given the NCAA a deadline. If they can't get their act together, we will get it together for them. But they're going to resolve this issue. And we're going to have a standard, so that these parents and these young athletes know what to expect. Likewise, I know you're talking to Gordon in a few minutes. I have been pretty hard on the NBA about their relationship with communist China. And when it comes to dealing with that, they need to be held to account for this. And let me flip to the mail-in voting. I have served on an election commission as a citizen in service in my county. PAYNE: Right. BLACKBURN: I think that we trust our local election commissions to run those elections fair and square. PAYNE: Right. BLACKBURN: That is where the accountability needs to be. I'm very leery of mail-in voting. PAYNE: You're not the only one. Senator Marsha Blackburn, thank you very much. Well, presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden held his first news conference in 89 days this past Tuesday. Up next: President Trump on how he plans to campaign against the former vice president and the concerns that he has over of voting by mail also, as we look ahead on \"Sunday Morning Futures.\" (COMMERCIAL BREAK) PAYNE: Welcome back. With the 2020 presidential election now just 120 days away, President Trump is calling mail-in voting the single biggest threat to his reelection. He recently sat down with Maria Bartiromo for an exclusive interview about why the Democrats want to change how America votes and why he believes it's a danger to our democracy. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) TRUMP: I'm running against the Democrats, and I'm running against the media. I'm running against the radical left. I'm running against some really stupid Republicans that don't understand how good they had it, because we have some Republicans -- I'm at 95 or 96 percent with the Republican Party, but we have some people that claim to be Republicans, and they've gone crazy. And the reason is, I have defeated them all. You know, they were all my opponents, and they've never gotten over it, guys, Weaver and Schmidt, all losers. And they go out and they try buying commercials. And you say, gee, we've rebuilt our military. We've taken care of our vets. Our vets are in the best shape. You've never seen anything like with the vets, with Choice, with everything else.\u00a0 We've done such a good job. And then you add the judges and you add protecting our Second Amendment.\u00a0 And what are these guys going to do? Support Joe Biden?\u00a0 MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: No.\u00a0 \u00a0TRUMP: And, you know, because Joe has been brought way left, way, way left. They've never gotten over losing to me. It wasn't supposed to happen. And then I had another race. It was against crooked Hillary Clinton. And she's never gotten over it either. BARTIROMO: Well, she's been tweeting already, saying that we have to vote by mail. Now, I know that there was interference in the 2016 election. They were out to get you, and they wanted to take you down. There's another kind of interference, and that could be fooling around with voting machines. I mean, in terms of voting by mail, vote proxies, what's your take? Do you want that? TRUMP: So... BARTIROMO: She's been tweeting about that, Hillary. TRUMP: Voting by mail is very dangerous, because people can grab them. People can take that proxy, sign a name. They can -- they can do all sorts of things, especially harvesting. They go out, and they say just -- let's put them all together. And that's happened. And, by the way, we were thinking it might happen in California. We were worried about the race. But, look, in California, they actually won. They voted by mail, the one we just won today. We just won it, vote by mail. And they were losing, because, when you vote by mail, you see the tally, how it's going, right? And we were losing. We were losing that issue. So, we lost that issue. We're voting by mail. We're winning. What happens? They immediately set a voting booth up -- wasn't supposed to -- in the middle of a Democrat area, so they could get votes. But they still didn't do it. We won the race. It's pretty amazing.\u00a0 BARTIROMO: So, why would Nancy Pelosi come up with this $3.9 trillion plan, if she knows... TRUMP: I think she wants -- yes. Yes. BARTIROMO: ... it's dead on arrival, she's knows nobody's going to go for a marijuana business in the middle of a pandemic. What -- I mean... TRUMP: More than anything else, she wants the voter -- the way of voting changed, because, if you did that -- look, they have had some very dishonest things. You look at California. Look at Los Angeles, where Judicial Watch settled a case, where they agreed that a million votes were fraudulent. A million votes in one area were fraudulent. And they could have done a lot more, but it was almost -- it was so ridiculous, there was no reason to go any further. They came to a settlement. They agreed on a million votes. The level of dishonesty with Democrat voting is unbelievable. If you told a Republican to vote twice, they'd get sick at even the thought of it. And you have people that vote numerous times. What's happening is crazy. So, now they want to send out vote by mail. Who's going to -- who knows who's signing this stuff? Not only should they come and vote. Now, if you're a senior citizen, and if you're this or that, like in Florida, there's a great system of voting. But it's a fair system, and it's a very closely watched system.\u00a0 So, in some cases, age, you're not feeling well, you should be able to do it. But you have to go out and vote. And if you don't do that, it can be -- we'll have the worst rigged election since Bernie Sanders, because Bernie Sanders, he has had a lot of bad things happen to him. You know, it's interesting with Bernie Sanders.\u00a0 BARTIROMO: That's a good point. I'm glad you're making that.\u00a0 TRUMP: If Bernie Sanders -- if Elizabeth Warren drops -- and nobody talks about this. I say it all the time, because it's so basic. Elizabeth Warren was a failed candidate, but she got a lot of the super liberal votes, you know, the radical left, I call it. And she didn't drop out of the race Super Tuesday. If she drops out of the race -- she doesn't even have to endorse Bernie Sanders.\u00a0 He wins every state, almost every state against Biden. But she didn't. And then two other people who did drop out, they gave the support to Biden. If -- and despite that, if she does it, because she got thousands of votes. Every one of those races were very close. She -- he would win almost every state, Bernie Sanders. And that was the establishment Democrats killing Bernie Sanders.\u00a0 BARTIROMO: Wow. You know, Mr. President, there are a lot of people today that are very happy that you're so tough, as tough as you are, because there's a statute -- there's a 1947 statute that says Nancy Pelosi would yield all of the powers of the presidency if the president and the vice president could not -- consistent with the law, she could issue whatever executive orders she wanted, fire disfavored political appointees, and, in general, direct the executive branch, as she pleased.\u00a0 She's third in line.\u00a0 TRUMP: It's never going to happen. We'll keep our vice president very healthy, and I will stay healthy. Never going to happen. She would be a disaster. But, look, Nancy Pelosi is a disaster, OK? Even doing a thing like that with her crazy vote, what she wants to do is get involved with the voting. She just got back to Washington.\u00a0 Everybody said, what -- what was so long? She just got back here. So, let's just see how it all works out ... BARTIROMO: So...\u00a0 TRUMP: But I think we're going to have a great election. I'm getting really good poll numbers. For the most part, they're not being shown. And I saw Joe Biden on television yesterday. And if you watch him, he knows nothing. He knows absolutely nothing. BARTIROMO: Do you think he will be the candidate?\u00a0 TRUMP: I don't know. I just don't know. I mean, I'm looking -- normally, it's -- of course he's going to be the candidate. Again, if Elizabeth Warren, Pocahontas, as I affectionately call her, because her whole life was a fraud -- if Elizabeth Warren just got out before Super Tuesday, it would be Bernie. I don't care who it is. It doesn't matter. I actually would prefer, Joe. I think I would prefer Joe. Who knows, right, about those things. But a lot of people wonder, is he going to be the candidate? BARTIROMO: But, you know, how will you be positioning yourself for the election? Because people voted for you because they trusted your economic smarts. They knew you could turn things around for the economy and business. You're a business... TRUMP: And I did.\u00a0 \u00a0BARTIROMO: The first business president. Exactly. TRUMP: Look... BARTIROMO: Unemployment potential. TRUMP: ... we had to turn off our country. We had the greatest -- as we say... BARTIROMO: So, will you position yourself differently going into this election? TRUMP: No, I don't think so. I'm going to do it again. I got to do it again. I did it once. I showed it can be done. (END VIDEOTAPE) PAYNE: Coming up: The Department of Justice continues its probe into the origins of the Russia investigation. Attorney General Bill Barr on where the investigation stands now, as we look ahead on \"Sunday Morning Futures.\" (COMMERCIAL BREAK) PAYNE: Welcome back. As U.S. Attorney General John Durham continues his investigation into the origins of the Russia probe, these newly declassified handwritten notes by former FBI agent Peter Strzok reveal President Obama and Vice President Joe Biden first raised the Logan Act during an Oval Office conversation about Michael Flynn on January 5, 2017, just weeks before President Trump's inauguration. Attorney General Bill Barr recently spoke exclusively with Maria Bartiromo about why the FBI was targeting the incoming administration and who the mastermind might be. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BARTIROMO: A source said to me a couple of years ago, speaking of the Russia collusion story, that this was the closest the United States ever game to a coup to take down a president since the assassination of Lincoln. Is that an appropriate statement? WILLIAM BARR, U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL: In this sense. I think it is the closest we have come to an organized effort to push a president out of office. BARTIROMO: And it continues. BARR: But what -- you know, I'm not reaching a judgment as to what the motivations there were. BARTIROMO: Can you tell us anything about how this all started? This is not just an American citizen. This was a man running for president, and this was a person who got elected to become the president. And the FBI thought it was a good idea to launch an investigation into Donald Trump and potential collusion. Why? BARR: You know, I guess I don't want to talk about that. Some of it may become evident as the -- as more facts are disclosed. But I think there were probably a range of motives for different people. BARTIROMO: But is there any evidence that, in fact, it was appropriate to launch an investigation, other than a conversation in a bar? I know that George Papadopoulos had a conversation in a bar. BARR: That is the official version of what happened, that that comment in a London wine bar was what the basis really was for going forward. And I have said that I thought that that was a very slender reed to get law enforcement intelligence agencies involved in investigating the campaign of one's political opponent. BARTIROMO: Lindsey Graham told us that four FBI case agents talked to the Russian subsource, in other words, the person who compiled some of the information in the dossier, and that subsource told those agents that it was just bar talk, that it wasn't true, that we didn't really buy it anyway. Did those case agents tell their superiors that? BARR: Again, I don't want to get into the details, because those are the kinds of things we're looking at. But that whole vignette is laid out to some extent in the I.G.'s report, that, in January 2017 and in March 2017, they talked to the primary subsource, who was the sole conduit for this information that made up the dossier. And, as I have said, the dossier pretty much collapsed at that point. And yet they continued to use it as a basis for pursuing this counterintelligence investigation. BARTIROMO: So, does it sound like Jim Comey and Andrew McCabe knew that the dossier had collapsed in January of 2017? BARR: I don't want to discuss that aspect of it. BARTIROMO: Is there any culpability from the media? Because, probably, you couldn't really have the story as broad-based and loud in your face as we had it without the media. BARR: Generally, as a practical matter, no, there's -- there's little risk of liability for the -- for a reporter to disclose information that they have obtained. Now, sometimes, news organizations may go too far in soliciting and obtaining that information, which could create problems for them. But, generally speaking, it's very hard to go after the reporters. BARTIROMO: Ric Grenell calls the transition period key. What can you tell us about the transition period that we need to understand better? BARR: Well, it depends on what the motivations were and why they were looking at it. But it is -- I would say it's unusual for an outgoing administration, high- level officials, to be unmasking very much in the days they're preparing to leave office. It makes you wonder what they were doing. BARTIROMO: And in that meeting on -- the Oval Office meeting that now is much talked about on January 5, 2017, when President Obama and Vice President Biden were there, along with their deputies, they talked about the Logan Act with regard to General Flynn. That was the first time I had heard that become an issue, given that they were pursuing collusion with Russia. So, was that an opportunity to just try to take down Flynn any way they could? BARR: Well, we have said what we have to say about Flynn in our filing to dismiss the charges. And we discuss the invocation, to the extent that it was invoked, of the Logan Act. But the Logan Act was, in my view, facially absurd to raise in this context, where you have an incoming national security adviser. This wasn't just a private citizen engaged in negotiations to the detriment of the United States. This was somebody coming into office in a transition, which is an officially recognized function of the United States, and discussing future relations. BARTIROMO: Adam Schiff is an elected official, the chairman of the Intel Committee. When these guys speak, you stop and listen. Adam Schiff said multiple times that there was collusion in plain sight. Is it no accountability for an elected official, someone that the public obviously trusts just by their resume, to say one thing in a closed-door situation, when you're under oath, like so many in the Obama administration said, we have no evidence of collusion, but then they went out on television and they said the complete opposite? They said, \"Collusion is in plain sight.\" That's a quote from Adam Schiff. \"The president committed treason.\" That's a quote from John Brennan. Is there no accountability? Can Adam Schiff, because he's an elected official, not be under oath and lead a witness anywhere he wants, even if he's lying, and just get away with it, no problem? And the rest of us are all under oath. BARR: Well, as far as public comments like these people have been making in press conferences and on television and so forth, you know, the accountability is really elections for Schiff. That's why we have elections. If the people of his district want him to continue to behave as he has, then they can send him back to office. It is infuriating, and it's the same phenomenon I discussed with the media, which is, the media misled the American people grossly over a long period of time with exaggerated claims and misinformation. And they haven't been held accountable, and the same for a lot of these talking heads who were out there saying that their information was that the president and his family were going to be indicted on Friday. Nothing happens. And then, later, when it turns out there's nothing there, whoops, I guess -- I guess I thought there was stuff there that I -- you know, apparently wasn't -- and then on to the next misinformation campaign. BARTIROMO: So, did the media -- was the media aiding and abetting this narrative? BARR: They were certainly driving it... BARTIROMO: Yes. BARR: ... and apparently working closely with people who -- other individuals who were driving it as well. (END VIDEOTAPE) PAYNE: We will have more of Maria's interview with Attorney General Bill Barr, as we look ahead on \"Sunday Morning Futures.\" (COMMERCIAL BREAK) \u00a0PAYNE: Welcome back. On Tuesday, the FCC officially declared Chinese telecom companies Huawei and ZTE as national security threats. The decision prevents U.S. companies from using government subsidies to buy equipment from Huawei and ZTE. Attorney General Bill Barr recently spoke with Maria Bartiromo about China's technological ambitions and why the future of America is at risk. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BARTIROMO: Can you tell me a bit about what the CCP is doing? I know there's been a real rethinking of the relationship between the United States and China. BARR: The way I look at is, this is fundamental challenge to the United States. Since the late 19th century, our opportunity and our growth, our prosperity as a country has come from our technological leadership. We have been the technological leader of the world. In the last decade or so, China has been putting on a great push to supplant us, explicitly. They want to be the leader in all the future technologies that are going to dominate the economy. And so what's at stake is the economic opportunity of our children and our grandchildren, whether we can continue to be the technological leader of the world. The Chinese have embarked on a very aggressive program during this time of stealing and cheating in order to overtake us. They have stolen our intellectual property. When they steal our secrets about future technology, they're stealing the future of the American people. If they start leading in some of these fundamental foundational technologies like 5G, which will be the platform of much of our future manufacturing in the United States, they will have tremendous leverage over the United States. If all our industrial practices and our manufacturing practices are built on a platform that they dominate, they will have ultimate leverage over the West. So, I think this is a competition for the future. They haven't been competing fairly. And the president has confronted this, when no one else has. And the American business community has been a big part of the problem, because they're willing, ultimately, many of them, to sacrifice the long-term viability of their companies for short-term profit, so they can get their stock options and move into the Gulf resort. That's what's driving some of this. They're not taking the long-term view and the national view of the American -- of maintaining the American strength. BARTIROMO: Well, I was talking with one money manager the other day. And he said: Look, Maria, I'm not going to call good guys and bad guys. It's not my role to call out good guys and bad guys. So, yes, the growth is in China, and that's where I want to invest. BARR: Well, you know what? We're not speaking German today because the American business in the past didn't think that way. They stood with the United States. And all the privileges and the benefits and the stability and the rule of law and the ability to profit as they do, both as companies and individuals, comes from the strength of this country. We are clearly cracking down on researchers and others that are sent over here to get involved in our key technological programs. And, by the way, this is not just weapons systems. This is agriculture. This is medicine. This is robotics. This is artificial intelligence and so forth. It's the whole gamut of important technologies going forward. BARTIROMO: So, are they seeking out people like the chairman of the chemistry department at Harvard to try to get those people to work with them? Are they seeking people out? BARR: The Chinese efforts run the gamut from more traditional espionage of recruiting people to work for them, explicitly, to cultivating relationships that they are then able to use. And the people frequently are not completely attuned to the fact that they are being used as essentially stooges for the Chinese. So, it runs the gamut of things. And, sometimes, some of these programs, high-sounding programs, are used to the advantage of the Chinese. So, the American business community, we need their understanding of the nature of the problem right now. BARTIROMO: So, what about the Huawei threat? We know that there are backdoors in some cases where data in the Huawei infrastructure goes back to the Chinese Communist Party. We have talked about that a lot. Is that true? BARR: Yes. BARTIROMO: Would the U.S. consider acquiring... BARR: I would say -- I would say, there is certainly the capacity to do that, and a very high risk of that. BARTIROMO: Would the U.S. consider acquiring Ericsson and Nokia to send a message to the world that, if you use Ericsson and Nokia, you have got the backing of the United States government, as an alternative to Huawei? BARR: So, I mean, I gave a speech a while back saying that it was -- that the two companies best positioned to compete with Huawei are Ericsson and Nokia. But unlike Huawei -- Huawei has the backing of the Chinese government and all the Chinese government money. So, just to give you an example, for 5G network facilities, the total global addressable market is probably around $90 billion, and the Chinese government has set up a fund of 100 -- over $100 billion to subsidize it. So, they can go to countries and say, hey, we will put this in cash-free, very cheap money. So, that's what we're competing against with Huawei. And companies like Ericsson and Nokia are the strongest Western competitors in this sector. BARTIROMO: So, you would be OK taking a stake, even if it's a minority stake, in these companies to offset the threat of Huawei, then? BARR: That's not a decision for the Justice Department. I do think that the West has to pick a horse or horses. BARTIROMO: Is China using this COVID-19 pandemic to gain leverage and gain territory? We know that the CCP is overreaching in Hong Kong and militarizing the South China Sea. BARR: I'm concerned that they might think that we are sufficiently distracted by COVID that we won't be able to respond. And I am concerned that they may think the current environment is one in which they can push the envelope somewhat and take advantage of it. BARTIROMO: What's most important in terms of protecting U.S. national security? BARR: First, I think protecting American technological leadership, as I have discussed, and I would also say thwarting their espionage and influence activities are the most important things we can do, and also, through international partners, press the Chinese to play by the rules, play by the rules of the road, which they haven't done. You know, it's too bad that one of the great tragedies, I think, has -- the Chinese people are a great people, with a great history, very industrious and able. And the hope was that, by bringing them into the world system and economic system, there would be a liberalization of their government. But I think the Communist Party still has an iron grip on that country. And I think that's unfortunate. (END VIDEOTAPE) PAYNE: Anger in Hong Kong after China passes a controversial new law that cracks down on political dissent and could severely restrict civil liberties in the former British colony. Asia analyst Gordon Chang says this could mean the end of one country/two systems. He joins us next, as we look ahead on \"Sunday Morning Futures.\" (COMMERCIAL BREAK) \u00a0(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BARTIROMO: What really concerns so many people is that this law seems to be sending a warning to the United States and other countries, because several parts of the security legislation take aim at the perceived role of foreigners. SEN. MARCO RUBIO (R-FL): I think anyone at this point that travels to Hong Kong, whether it's an American businessman or a Canadian businessman or anything, for that matter, is out of their minds. What this basically says now, that law now says that, whether you're a Chinese citizen or a resident of Hong Kong or not, if you have said things or done things critical of the Chinese government, and you step foot on Hong Kong, they now reserve the right to arrest you. (END VIDEO CLIP) PAYNE: That was Florida Senator Marco Rubio speaking on \"Mornings With Maria\" after Hong Kong police made dozens of arrests in the first day after the passage of a controversial new national security law, sweeping legislation that could potentially erode any remaining autonomy in the city. I want to bring in Asia analyst Gordon Chang. He is the author of \"The Coming Collapse of China,\" also a senior fellow at the Gatestone Institute. Gordon, thanks for joining us. Senator Rubio suggesting that even American businessmen at this point would be wise to avoid Hong Kong. Is it that dangerous right now? GORDON CHANG, AUTHOR, \"THE COMING COLLAPSE OF CHINA\": Well, it certainly is, because we don't know the scope of this national security law, but, on paper, it gives China the ability to imprison anybody that it wants. And, indeed, you don't even have to go to Hong Kong to be at risk, because Hong Kong and China have extradition treaties with other countries. And Article 38 of this law says that any comment, any statement on foreign soil by a foreigner is a violation of the national security law if it advocates succession, terrorism, collusion, sedition, all the rest of it. PAYNE: Gordon, there was a sort of game of cat and mouse, if you will, ahead of the official vote on this. We knew it was coming. America took action. Congress took action. President Trump took action as well. And still China steamrolled ahead with this anyway. What's the message that they're sending by -- when it's acknowledged that this has actually galvanized political foes, not just in America, but around the world, ahead of this passage? CHANG: Yes, China is saying that it not only demands the total obedience of people in China. It demands the total obedience of people in Hong Kong. And, Charles, let's not make any mistake about this. China demands total obedience from everybody else in the world. It can't enforce that right now, but that really is the message. PAYNE: The one country/two systems agreement, is that effectively out the window? CHANG: Yes, it is. China promised a high degree of autonomy under the one country/two systems formula for 50 years. Now, 23 years in, that's no longer the case, because the national security law allows China to do anything it wants in Hong Kong. And, indeed, as we talked about, its scope is international. So, comments or activities outside of China and Hong Kong are subject to this national security law. PAYNE: Gordon, you know the dissidents' movement in Hong Kong pretty well. Are they going to be able to overcome this, even, of course, in the back -- with the backdrop of coronavirus? Because it feels like China really is -- this is it. They're going to stamp out this potential revolutionary period. CHANG: I think the answer is yes, because really what we have is more than just a protest movement, Charles. We have an insurgency. And we know that insurgencies can disappear for times, but they can come back, and they usually do. Now, in Hong Kong, we have seen the pro-democracy forces be intimidated. So, for instance, people deleted their Twitter accounts. They also disbanded pro-democracy organizations. And some people, indeed, have already fled. But, nonetheless, we did see protests on July 1, which had marked the handover from Britain to China. PAYNE: All right. CHANG: So, this is going to continue. PAYNE: Folks, we will have more with Gordon Chang in just a moment, as we look ahead on \"Sunday Morning Futures.\" (COMMERCIAL BREAK) PAYNE: We're back with Gordon Chang. Gordon, just before your segment, Maria Bartiromo speaking with Attorney General Bill Barr, and she mentioned that a lot of Wall Street folks aren't interested in picking good guys vs. bad guys. And, of course, it really -- he bristled at the idea that they would think this way, noting that this is not about profits, this is about the future for our children and grandchildren, and maybe Wall Street and these big businesses are not taking that seriously enough. CHANG: Well, they're certainly not, Charles. But we have got to remember that business is generally amoral. And it's not up to them to determine national security policy. That's up to the president of the United States. And it's also up to the president to implement it. So, although I think Wall Street and American business are engaging in really terrible and disgusting tactics, nonetheless, it's up to Washington to stop them. PAYNE: You know, the same -- by the same token, I was on \"FOX & Friends\" this morning, and I said, we haven't been paying attention to China. When I said we, I meant as a nation, because of our media. You have been on this for years. Maria has been on this for at least three or four years. And I think we're overlooking the threat here. What do you make of that, that this is a building time bomb that we're going to have to deal with at some point, maybe sooner, rather than later? CHANG: You're absolutely right about that, Charles. In the last week, we have heard several Chinese officials and former officials talk about an all-out confrontation with the United States. They say they need to prepare for it. Obviously, we're not deterring China. There's a Chinese military that killed 20 Indian soldiers on June 15. And I think it has not satisfied its bloodlust. So, we have got to be extremely concerned what happens next, because Chinese leaders are engaging in provocative conduct across the world and across their region. PAYNE: I have got less than a minute to go, Gordon. But, on that point, I feel like Taiwan might be where we're heading, a confrontation there. If you read between the lines, it looks like that's building pretty rapidly. CHANG: You're right. Xi Jinping, the Chinese ruler, has on a number of occasions this year threatened an invasion of Taiwan. The Chinese officials have warned Secretary of State Pompeo that this is a red line. And, indeed, Chinese military has engaged in some very provocative behavior around Taiwan and over Taiwan. PAYNE: Gordon Chang, as always, thank you very, very much, a very important topic. And I'm so glad we covered it. Well, that does it for \"Sunday Morning Futures.\" I'm Charles Payne. And it has been my pleasure to fill in for Maria Bartiromo. I will be seeing you tomorrow on \"Making Money\" at 2:00 p.m. Eastern on the FOX Business Network. Please have a safe and very healthy Fourth of July weekend.

Typically, consulates carry out services such as issuing visas and engaging in cultural exchanges. But the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) outpost in  was far from a typical consulate.Instead, the consulate served as a front for the CCP and a central node in the massive spying operation that  uses to undermine the United States. This network carries out all sorts of espionage \u2014 political, defensive, industrial, academic, and commercial \u2014 to try to gain a strategic edge over the U.S. by cheating and stealing.America\u2019s adversaries, including China and Russia, use their consulates to conduct all sorts of nefarious activities. For the CCP, the Houston consulate served as a base of operations to exploit commercial joint ventures for state purposes and to gain access to advanced technology, proprietary information, and intellectual property in order to advance Beijing\u2019s efforts to undermine U.S. economic and national security.Critically, the Houston consulate covered China's activities in seven states, including my home state of Florida.The Chinese diplomats had been involved in stealing scientific research, as well as facilitating travel to China using falsified paperwork. The consulate also had used CCP-controlled community groups to cultivate Texas elites. And considering this occurred in Houston, the malign Chinese activity likely involved theft and espionage connected to the U.S. energy and health care sectors.The Trump administration\u2019s decision to shut the consulate down is exactly right and sends a strong message to China, Russia and other adversaries that this illegal espionage will no longer be tolerated.This isn\u2019t the first time the Trump administration has had to deal with this sort of behavior. Just last December, it was forced to expel two Chinese Embassy officials on suspicions of espionage, after they were caught attempting to access a sensitive military installation in Virginia.We cannot simply ignore the prolific increase of Chinese espionage and political influence operations, especially on American soil. Sometimes a hammer is required to send a message.As the consular staff members pack their bags, we must also remember that the Houston consulate was a cog in a much larger system of exploitation.The CCP is seemingly unable to conduct international relations without spying, especially on the people the party claims as its own, such as Chinese-Americans \u2014 wherever they are and in every facet of their lives.Chinese espionage and data collection are evident all throughout their diplomatic corps \u2014\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 from excessive visa application requirements on Chinese Americans, to exerting control over Chinese community organizations, to pushing co-opted Chinese students toward sensitive research areas.Chinese surveillance and influence operations can be pointed to different ends. Some influence agents are tasked with swaying members of Congress as well as state and local politicians under the auspices of diplomatic relations. Others steal commercial secrets from defense contractors or in important sectors like advanced manufacturing.The United States has tried to work productively with China to reduce these tactics and mend relations.For example, in 2015, both of our governments agreed to stop using their intelligence services to steal technology for commercial gain. That agreement lasted just weeks, and the Trump administration made clear to Beijing that Americans would not allow China\u2019s underhanded treachery by indicting three Chinese government-affiliated hackers for stealing economic secrets in 2017.The message went unheeded. China\u2019s exploitation of American companies continued relentlessly. Just this week, the Justice Department accused two Chinese hackers working for Beijing's spy service of trying to steal information pertaining to the creation of a COVID-19 vaccine.By closing the Houston consulate, the United States signaled the status quo between the United States and China is unacceptable.In the meantime, I will soon be introducing legislation to ban Chinese firms from American capital markets if those companies are found to have engaged in espionage or human rights abuses, or otherwise exist to bolster Beijing\u2019s military.It is in everyone\u2019s interest for the United States and China to enjoy a balanced relationship in the 21st century.

The New South Wales Police Force, \u201ctogether with Chinese authorities and universities,\u201d warned members of the community about an elaborate phone scam targeting Chinese students, known globally as a \u201cvirtual kidnapping.\u201d In 2020 alone, the agency identified eight incidents where scammers targeting Chinese international students successfully obtained a total of $3.2 million in ransom payments. In one of those cases, a father in China had paid more than $2 million to scammers before he was sent a photo of his daughter gagged and bound. At that point, he contacted the New South Wales Police Force, who found the woman an hour later alone and unharmed in a Sydney hotel room,  reported. Phone scammers \u2013 who usually speak Mandarin \u2013 have called Chinese students in Australia, posing as officials from the Chinese Embassy, Consulate or police, according to investigators. They first convince students they have been implicated in a crime in China or that their identity has been stolen, and that they must pay a fee to avoid legal action, arrest\u00a0or deportation.Using technology to mask their physical locations, scammers then encourage students to continue communications through various encrypted applications such as WeChat and WhatsApp. The victim is then threatened or coerced into transferring large amounts of money into unknown offshore bank accounts. In some instances, students have been convinced to fake their own kidnappings.Scammers instruct Chinese students to cease contact with their family and friends, rent a hotel room, and take photographs or video recordings that depict them bound and blindfolded. These files are then shared with the victim\u2019s relatives overseas.When the victim\u2019s parents are unable to establish contact with their child in Australia, they send large ransom payments in exchange for their \u201crelease,\u201d  The caller will continue to make threats and ransom demands until they are unable to obtain any further payments, often resulting in the victim\u2019s family making contact with police.NSW Police Force State Crime Command Director Detective Chief Superintendent Darren Bennett said police have been in contact with the Chinese Embassy and Consulate in Sydney about the scams. \u201cInternational students, who have chosen to study abroad in Australia, are in an unfamiliar environment and often living away from family and friends for the first time,\u201d NSW Police Force Corporate Sponsor for the Safety and Wellbeing of International Students, Assistant Commissioner Peter Thurtell added. \u201cThe victims of virtual kidnappings we have engaged are traumatized by what has occurred, believing they have placed themselves, and their loved ones, in real danger,\u201d he said.He said students who receive calls from someone claiming to be a Chinese official and wish to check on the validity of the caller should contact the Chinese Consulate in Sydney for advice.

I'm Martha MacCallum in New York. And this is a fast-moving \"Story\" tonight. A lot of breaking news for you this evening.And a rapidly changing landscape for the 2020 election. The President canceled the Jacksonville portion of the Republican National Convention when he came out to speak to the press today.Also, we've got some brand new polling numbers for you from Fox polling that show that the President trails Joe Biden in the battleground states of Michigan, Minnesota and Pennsylvania, as we are about 100 days out from the election.Mr. Trump was in a similar position, though, we should point out back in 2016, and after his very surprising victory that year there was a lot of talk in the country about who these voters in this silent majority in America could be? Watch this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Trump voters were long-suffering; analysts say often silenced.GREG MYTROSEVICH, OHIO TRUMP VOTER: A lot of people kept quiet about a lot of things.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: So you don't say it in the polls, you don't say it to anybody else, but you show up and in the voting booth you go Trump.JOHN BRABENDER, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST: They're not answering the phone and telling people publicly they're voting for Donald Trump.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: Could some new numbers tonight from the libertarian think tank, the Cato Institute suggests that Americans are still, in fact even more so now, keeping their politics to themselves. Look at these numbers. 62 percent say that today's climate prevents them from talking about what they believe with anybody. By a large margin, those who identify, though, as very liberal. This is the group who feels the most free to speak out among friends, family, whatever, about their politics.So what exactly does this tell us about the state of the 2020 race? And what is America's growing frustration with cancel culture as an adjunct to that tell us? Marc Thiessen and Marie Harf are here to debate tonight.Also, as Bret mentioned, my exclusive interview this evening with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who just delivered a blistering message to China's communist leadership, calling on the Chinese people to perhaps consider a different path than the communist government that leads them. We're going to break that down and talk to him about exactly what he said about that.That, as China says they are not going to leave the embassy in Houston. We will get for the first time the Secretary of State to respond to them, digging in their heels at that embassy in moments.Then after that, K.T. McFarland is here with her analysis of the Pompeo interview. What's - are we in a cold war with China now? Is China been a failed experiment since 1979? All that with Katie.But we start tonight with Marc Thiessen, American Enterprise Institute Scholar and Marie Harf, Executive Director of Serve America PAC. Both are Fox News Contributors. Great to have both of you here tonight, Marie and Marc.It strikes me every time we have anyone on from the Trump campaign, we show them the latest numbers. Tonight we just showed everybody the latest numbers from Michigan, Minnesota and Pennsylvania. And they always say, look, we don't care. The polls aren't right. There's a lot of secret Trump voters out there, which we saw in a Monmouth poll last week in Pennsylvania. But Marc, it makes it very difficult to gauge where the country is at right now.MARC THIESSEN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Yes. Well, they probably overstated, especially these new Fox News polls show a big gap. It's probably not as big a gap as the polls show. So I don't think Democrats should get too excited about it.But I think that - and questionably there are secret Trump voters. In fact, there was a poll - Monmouth poll in Pennsylvania, that 57 percent of the voters there were pretty sure that some of their neighbors were planning to vote for Trump, but weren't saying it.And there's a reason for that. There's the cancel culture as it has taken hold in a way it has in recent months. I mean, think about this. Is it more or less hospitable environment for a Trump supporter to express their support for the president now than it was four months ago? I think not. So, I think that - I think there are a lot of people who won't tell a pollster that they're supporting Trump and - but are really going to vote for him in the ballot box.MACCALLUM: I think it's fascinating. And when you look at that number, 62 percent say that they do not want to share their political feelings with anybody. And back in 2017, three years ago, that number was at 58 percent. So we've seen increase, Marie, in the people in the country who are just saying, I'm not going to talk about it. I'm keeping my decision to myself.MARIE HARF, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Yes, Martha. And every Democrat, I know is running like Joe Biden is 10 points behind for this exact reason. People were very confident in 2016 that Hillary Clinton would win. We know there was a hidden Trump voter then in many of these swing states that the Fox News poll spoke to today like Michigan or Pennsylvania, where Donald Trump won by very little in 2016.So Democrats are worried about this. They really want to act like they're running from behind. I think these numbers do concern the Trump team, though. And I also think it's a really polarized time in our country. I mean, there are people on the other side of the aisle who've told me that Democrats hate America, and they hate Christianity. And that kind of language, even four or five years ago wasn't really out there. So our country is really deeply divided. We see that every day and it's a real problem. I don't know how to fix it. There's no easy answer.MACCALLUM: Yes. I want you to take a look at some of these other numbers, because they are disturbing. I mean, let's pull up this one. 32 percent worry about their jobs, because if their political opinions become known, they're concerned that they could lose their job.Look at this next one. Do you think it's OK to fire someone who supports Trump or Biden? In other words, if at your job it became known that you had given money to Joe Biden or who had given money to Trump, they support firing you. 50 percent of those who consider themselves very liberal, Marc - I mean, just think about this. So they support - they think that person should be fired from their company, that's a very disturbing number.THIESSEN: Well, it's insane and the reality is--MACCALLUM: I don't know what country--THIESSEN: --that it just show how polarized our country has become. But let's keep in mind - that I agree with Marie that there are some Republicans who say things that are overwrought about Democrats like saying that they don't love America. I condemn that.But the reality is, if you look at that poll, Republicans are more worried - there are more Republicans who are worried about expressing their views than Democrats by 25-point margin. The only group that feels that it's - that has - a majority feel confident about it, saying what they what they believe are staunch liberals.And the reason for that is, because there really isn't a penalty for being a liberal or for expressing staunch liberal views. You're not going to get in trouble at work for saying Black Lives Matter. You will get in trouble for saying blue lives matter. There will be repercussions for that. So I think there is - this cancel culture is going after the Right in a way that it's not over the Left. And we should condemn it whether it goes after conservatives or liberals.MACCALLUM: Yes. I also thought that deeper in that number, the 62 percent, who say that they don't feel comfortable talking about who they support politically, 59 percent of independents said that. So - I mean, these are the people who elect presidents and we don't know, which side they're on when you look at that number. But 59 percent of independents, Marie, said that they did not want to discuss who they will vote for or who they support.HARF: Yes, these numbers are really interesting, and I agree, disturbing in many ways. And Donald Trump as an election strategy hasn't gone after independents. He's really tripled down on his base. We've seen that with his rhetoric and his policies. And so, I don't know where those independents will break.In the polling we've seen from Fox and others, they're breaking towards Democrats and they certainly broke towards Democrats in 2018.MACCALLUM: That's interesting.HARF: But cancel culture is on both sides. Right? Like I'm not on Twitter--MACCALLUM: Is it?HARF: --because I was bullied off of it by conservatives. So it's on both sides and it's not good wherever it is.MACCALLUM: Yes.THIESSEN: Get back on Twitter, Marie, no one should believe you. I won't stand for it.MACCALLUM: It's disgusting what happens these days there.HARF: Thank you.MACCALLUM: Thank you very much, guys. Marie, Marc, great to have you. Lots more to talk to you about, but we'll pick it up next time. Thank you for being here tonight.So China digs in its heels now. This is a reflection of the burning of documents at that consulate in Houston. Now they say they're not going to leave the United States. So we asked Secretary of State Pompeo what he plans to do about that? Next.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MIKE POMPEO, SECRETARY OF STATE: Securing our freedoms from the Chinese Communist Party is the mission of our time, and America is perfectly positioned to lead it because our founding principles give us that opportunity.(END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)MACCALLUM: Are China and United States at a crossroads that could lead us into another Cold War? Perhaps even a Cold War decade. In a speech today at the Nixon Library, Secretary Pompeo said this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)POMPEO: The CCP fears the Chinese people's honest opinions more than any foe, and save for losing their own grip on power, they have reason - no reason to.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: That as China's General Consul in Houston tells POLITICO today in an interview that they do not plan to leave their Houston consulate.Here now exclusively to respond to that and lots of other things today is Secretary of State. Mike Pompeo. Mr. Secretary, thank you very much for speaking with us today.POMPEO: Martha, it's great to be with you. Thanks for having me on.MACCALLUM: Thank you. So let's start there. The consul in Houston says that they do not have plans to leave that consulate right now. What's your response to that?POMPEO: While everyone knows the rules for diplomats. You're only permitted to be there in a diplomatic status with the consent of the host nation. And so, I'm confident, we've had private conversations as well.I'm very confident that we'll proceed in a way that makes clear that it's not OK to use your diplomats to engage in industrial espionage. It's not OK to steal intellectual property. It's not OK to engage in those kind of behaviors. That's the reason we did it. We did it to protect the American people. And we're going to make sure that that happens.MACCALLUM: I guess, the question - they say that you're - that United States is abandoning the Vienna Convention and also violating the China- U.S. consular treaty. You, obviously, think that they've already violated both of those. But literally, physically, what if they say, we will not leave, what will the United States do?POMPEO: Yes. Martha, I'm not going to speculate. We're going to make sure that we protect the American people. President Trump began to talk about this threat back in 2015 in this campaign, and you're seeing his administration begin to do the things that will lead to make sure that the American people are safe and secure.And that the jobs that depend on American intellectual property aren't lost to theft from Chinese diplomats that sit in a place in Houston, Texas with great access to American scientific knowhow and business value.MACCALLUM: There is discussion that China may retaliate by asking us to leave one of the six embassies that we have in China. We also have one in Hong Kong. And it looks like Chengdu and potentially Wuhan are at the top of that list. Will we be vacating any of our embassies in China, Mr. Secretary?POMPEO: Martha, let's go back to first principles. The first principles are this, for 40 plus years now - and this is why I'm at the Nixon Library today. For 40 plus years, America has turned the other cheek while we've watched the Chinese Communist Party engage in activity that's fundamentally not fair to the American people, it's not reciprocal for the American people and it doesn't have the transparency we need, so that we can engage with China in a way that's fair for our people and provide security for people. That's what we're aiming to do.And so this decision about the consulate that was made is consistent with all - whole bunch of other actions that we have already taken. A whole bunch more that we're going to continue to do until we get the change.I talked about President Nixon saying that the important thing was that we could induce change from China. That's the mission set the President Trump has set our course on. So whether it is the indictments that have been handed down by the Department of Justice, or the decisions we've made with respect to Hong Kong.All of those are aimed at inducing change inside the Chinese Communist Party for the simple purpose of protecting the American people. And so the Chinese government will get to make its decisions about our diplomats their inside of China. We will make sure that we do right by the American people.MACCALLUM: So, I mean, it sounds like you're saying that this is a very ruptured relationship. And, if I'm reading too much in to take from that, but it - we may, yes, we may pull out of embassies in China that might be part of this process.POMPEO: Yes, Martha I talked today about actions, not words. I was in Honolulu, just a few weeks back. I met with Yang Jiechi. We had a wonderful discussion. But in the end, what matters are actions, the things that make sure that we protect the American people. President Trump's trade deal was a good first effort. That the Phase 1 trade deal is important. If we get that right, that'd be the beginning of a basis for us to expand a fair and reciprocal set of trading relationships.But look at our diplomatic relationship today. They have many more diplomats here in the United States than we have inside of China. And their diplomats here in the United States have much more freedom of movement, and much more access that our diplomats do in China - inside of China.MACCALLUM: Yes.POMPEO: All we're asking, Martha, all we're asking is we want it to be fair and reciprocal. And that's the aim of President Trump. It's what we're going to accomplish.MACCALLUM: So you talked about the sanctions that we have, there's military exercises that have also become somewhat more prominent in the region. We have two hackers that just received indictments. Are we in a Cold War right now with China? And if we're not, it certainly looks like we are.POMPEO: General Secretary Xi has clearly taken actions that are aggressive and broken promises that are central to how great power nations behave. Remember he made a promise back in 2015 in the Rose Garden with President Obama. He said he wouldn't militarize the South China Sea. You can go look, there's now significant military activity there by China.He made a promise to the people of Britain, to the people of Hong Kong that they would have a 50-year deal of one country two systems. He busted it. He broke it. United States is simply demanding that if the Chinese Communist Party wants to be considered in the League of Nations that have great power and great roles and great importance, they've got to behave according to promises that they make and the rules that have been set out for sovereign nations to preserve freedom for their own people.That's what we're seeking to see happen. Label it what you must. But President Trump understands that the previous administrations, both Republican and Democrat alike, turned the other cheek for an awfully long time.MACCALLUM: Yes.POMPEO: And resulted in a real imbalance in the relationship between the United States and China. We aim to fix it.MACCALLUM: I spoke to trade advisor Peter Navarro on this program several weeks back. And I said is the trade deal basically over? And he said, yes, it is. He walked that back a bit. But, it appears that it is. Is that fair to say at this point?POMPEO: No, I'm hopeful that the Phase 1 trade deal we've complied with by both sides. The Chinese Communist Party tells us that they're going to fulfill their commitments. We have every expectation that they will, and our task will be to verify that they've done so. We hope that they do. And if they do, perhaps there'll be an opportunity to build on that.And what we're not going to let happen is what we've allowed to happen before, is that they make a set of promises, they make a commitment, like the Phase 1 trade deal and then they try and they do a little bit and America calls it good enough. President Trump is not going to permit that to happen. We're going to hold them accountable for the promises that they make, MarthaMACCALLUM: President Trump just said moments ago, that that trade deal is not as important to him anymore as it once was.POMPEO: I understand that. I completely understand it. When you see what the Chinese Communist Party has done to our country and to the world with their failure to live up to another set of promises they made to the world about their responsibility if a pandemic began to break out of their country, the cover up that took place. You can absolutely understand why a trade deal like the Phase 1 trade deal no longer ranks first among all the various issues we have with the Chinese Communist Party.MACCALLUM: Yes.POMPEO: We've seen across the world, hundreds of thousands of deaths. Trillions of dollars in economic destruction wrought on this world, because the Chinese Communist Party failed to live up to some basic commitments to the world.MACCALLUM: You made a very strong appeal to the Chinese people in this speech, basically calling on them to call for a new form of government in China. Are you encouraging them towards regime change? And you said that we would encourage and empower - engage and empower. How will we do that? What - how do we play that role? What will that look like?POMPEO: Martha, I talked about several things. One of which is there are 1.4 billion Chinese people. And what I wanted to make clear in my remarks today is we want good things for them. They've raised hundreds of millions of people out of destitute, poverty, we think that's a good thing. We're not trying to contain the prosperity for the people of China. We're simply trying to preserve freedom for the people of the United States of America. That is the American task.President Trump, when he was sworn in, and I - when I was sworn in as Secretary of State, that's the promise that we made. And so what we are concerned about is not holding China down, but making sure that we all get this right, so that we can have a prosperous economy here in the United States of America, and that we can hold them accountable in ways that preserve and secure freedom for the American people. That's the mission.So when I talk about the Chinese people, I'm talking about making sure that they have the opportunity to participate on a fair and reciprocal basis, in the same way that we expect the American people will.MACCALLUM: I guess - but if I'm the government of China listening to what you're saying, it sounds like you are encouraging the people of China to rise up, to create a different - to push for a different form of government. And we see what's happening in Taiwan where they have a genuine fear that they might be invaded or attacked by the Mainland.You look at what's happening in Hong Kong, where they are experiencing a diminishment all the time of their independence. So those are very provocative words to the Chinese government to say we want your people to push for a new form of government.MACCALLUM: Martha, that's not what I said. Go back and reread what I talked about. This was a speech about the American perspective and the need for a global alliance of freedom loving nations. This is what we're demanding.We know that the Chinese Communist Party has a different system. They still have obligations to live up to promises, promises even that they make to their own people. Our task is to preserve freedom and security for our people. And we know we need partners to do that. We know we need friends.I was in London and Copenhagen just the last two days, talking to them about this. The whole world is beginning to see that when you bend the knee to China, that bad things happen to your own country. So I have every expectation what the whole world, indeed freedom loving people all around the world must demand that the Chinese Communist Party live up to the commitments that it makes.MACCALLUM: You talked a moment ago about - your obvious concerns about this virus and the origins of this virus. Today in the United States we passed 4 million cases, which is obviously a milestone that is difficult for everybody to hear. Nancy Pelosi, the Speaker of the House said that the President calls it the China virus. She said that she is calling it the Trump virus as a result of the President's handling of this virus. What do you say to that, sir?POMPEO: One ought not to make a virus that has had such devastation in United States a political matter. What one ought to do is to call out the people and places that resulted in this virus getting out of Wuhan, China. There's no mistake. There's lots to dispute about the precise origin of this virus. We'd love to know the answers to that. But sadly, the Chinese Communist Party has prevented that.But we know it came from Wuhan. We know they closed down Hubei Province, but didn't close down traveled to the rest of the world. That has caused enormous harm to the United States of America. So this is indeed a china virus. It emanated from there. Make no mistake about it. It is not political. It is factual.MACCALLUM: Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, thank you very much. Good to have you with us this evening. Thank you for your time, sir.POMPEO: Martha. Thank you.MACCALLUM: Former Deputy National Security Advisor K.T. McFarland on where all of this is leading the United States and China. Next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)MACCALLUM: Strong word tonight from Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. He says essentially, Richard Nixon was right when he wrote in 1967 that the world cannot be safe until China changes. And now the United States faces that turning point once again, here he is moments ago.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)POMPEO: --talked about President Nixon saying that the important thing was that we could induce change from China. That's the mission set the President Trump has set our course on. So whether it is the indictments that have been handed down by the Department of Justice, or the decisions we've made with respect to Hong Kong.All of those are aimed at inducing change inside the Chinese Communist Party for the simple purpose of protecting the American people.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: Former deputy national security advisor for the Trump administration. K.T. McFarland joins me now. She's the author of Revolution: Trump, Washington, and We, the People.\" K.T., good to see you tonight. Your thoughts on with the secretary of state had to say there.K.T. MCFARLAND, AUTHOR, \"REVOLUTION\": You know, this is a really significant interview you just had with him and it's a really significant event. And here's why it's important.Forty-nine years ago this month, Richard Nixon, President Nixon directed his national security advisor to go to China and open up relations with China, to bring China into the world.I was a young staff aide to Richard Nixon and Henry Kissinger at that time. I remember this as if it was yesterday.And that set American foreign policy with China in a certain direction for 50 years. And President Nixon was right. He said we will induce them to change. Our thoughts, Republican and Democrat alike was that as China modernizes, as China comes into the world, as they develop a middle class, they will be an open society, an open economy, an open society, but that's not how it turned out.The Chinese in fact have exploited that. And that's why Pompeo was at the Nixon Library today, because he is indicating we now have a reverse. We are now -- we are now acknowledging the fact that the Chinese have stolen intellectual property rights, have militarized the South China Sea, have unleashed a bio weapon onto the world, have practiced wolf diplomacy and so, we, the Trump administration with the United States we're going to have a very different approach to China going forward and that's exactly what he was telling you.And, Martha, I also thought it was interesting when he mentioned to you that he was in Copenhagen, he was in London.MACCALLUM: Yes.MCFARLAND: And he was talking to America's allies about getting the coalition together so we together stand up to China.MACCALLUM: And what does China's coalition look like?MCFARLAND: China has never had very many allies. I mean, their vision of the world and the world that they really want to impose on the rest of us is China is the superpower, China is going to be, they think, the world's major economic political, military, diplomatic power. And then China will determine what everybody else does.And you step out of line for a minute, you try to -- you try to challenge China, you try to go against China and you get crushed. The Australians, for example, the Australians had the temerity to say let's just investigate what happens with the pandemic, with the coronavirus and China turned around and tried to crush their exports, their barley and wheat exports to China. China has, they play with really elbows out sharp. There is President Trump says they are ruthless in their negotiations.MACCALLUM: Yes. Well, I mean, they've essentially someone say they've been buying friends in Latin America, in Asia, in Africa, we know helping with aid and all of that. So, it will be interesting to see if there is a cold war period that we are entering how everything lines up.Secretary Pompeo said we must engage and empower the Chinese people. And he was very careful to say that he is not calling for regime change in China, and yet, you can see these seeds of rebellion in Hong Kong wanting to stay independent, and in Taiwan saying to the rest the world, you know wake up.MCFARLAND: Yes.MACCALLUM: You know, we could be invaded.MCFARLAND: Yes. And I thought that was also really significant what he told you, because he was sort of talking about regime change but he really wasn't talking about regime change.I think that the pandemic, Hong Kong, the South China Sea, these has been a slap in the face in the world and I think it's a wake-up call to the rest of the world. And so, we are not criticizing China, the Chinese people. We are criticizing the Chinese Communist Party which runs China right now which is accumulated more and more power and is a dictatorship, really of President Xi Jinping who is now going to be president for life of China.MACCALLUM: It's fascinating to watch. And it reminds me so much of the Cold War with Russia, we're even in the space race.MCFARLAND: Yes.MACCALLUM: This time it's to Mars, the Chinese against the United States.So, K.T., thank you very much.MCFARLAND: There you have it.MACCALLUM: Great to see you as always.MCFARLAND: Thank you, Martha. Thank you.MACCALLUM: So, the CDC has just released new guidance on how to reopen our schools saying that COVID-19 poses low risk to school age children echoing the sentiment of President Trump today. We are going to talk to a panel of educators with decades of teaching experience about what they think this should look like when we come back.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Fortunately, the data shows that children are at lower risk from the China virus very substantially. When children do contract the virus, they often have only very mild symptoms or none at all.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: Fox News alert tonight. The CDC has just released their guidance for reopening schools this fall. The headline according to the CDC, this virus poses, quote, \"low risks to students and teachers,\" therefore face masks and social distancing are the best defense.Quote, \"the best available evidence from countries that have opened schools indicates that COVID-19 poses low risk to school age children. Reopening schools creates opportunity to invest in the education, well-being and future of one of America's greatest assets, our children, while taking every precaution to protect students, teachers, staff, and all their families.\"Tonight, we are joined by three teachers, all with different opinions about whether students can safely return to the classroom. Leigha Phillips teaches high school English, Krista Herrin teaches kindergarten and first grade special education, and Phil Strunk teaches middle school social studies.Great to have all of you with us today.Krista, let me start with you, teaching kindergartners, how do you feel about the fact that, you know, they say some very young children don't even need to do the mask part necessarily?KRISTA HERRIN, KINDERGARTEN & FIRST GRADE TEACHER: I have a lot of concerns going into the school year. Kindergartners love to share, they love to share toys, they love to share hugs and they love to share germs. And I think it's going to be really difficult for us to keep masks on kids and social distance in a small classroom. I don't have any windows in my room, so I'm just pretty nervous about how things are going to go this school year.MACCALLUM: So, how do you feel though about the statistics that show that it's -- you know, the transmission is very low among children and that the risk according to what we see in other countries appears to be very low in terms of -- even studies that have been done that show that their transmission to other people appears to be very low, that doesn't reassure you?HERRIN: It's reassuring but at the same time, here in the United States, we shut down before we had any chance to spread germs in the school. So that's my big concern is, we don't know. I mean, there are other countries that are showing that, but I just worry when we get closer to the fall and the winter with more illness, that we are going to see a lot more illness.MACCALLUM: Phil, what do you think about those guidelines?PHIL STRUNK, MIDDLE SCHOOL TEACHER: Regarding the guidelines whenever I look at them, I am, you know, it's comforting to see that students under age 10 we're not really seeing a high transmission but it's the number for students over age 10.The New York Times came out with an article that said we're spreading it -- or sorry -- 10-year-olds are spreading it at about the same age as adults. We are working in schools now where like the state of Pennsylvania, that a nurse to student ratio is 1500 to one. That guideline was set back in the 40s. In my home state of Virginia, it's over 800 to one. And the CDC guidelines are 750 to one.MACCALLUM: Yes.STRUNK: We're not exactly set right now to be able to combat this whole currently uncurable virus.MACCALLUM: But Phil, let me ask you this. Because, you know, looking at a chart here that shows the flu deaths in the country. So right now, we're at 30 children under 15. Thirty children under 15 have died, most of them had complicating factors and obviously no one wants to see any child die from any disease in this country.STRUNK: Sure.MACCALLUM: If we can prevent it we of course want to do everything we can. However, the average over the past 10 years of children who died because of the flu every year is 511. And we do not shut schools down from, you know, November to January every year because of the flu.STRUNK: Right. You're absolutely right, we don't shut it down during the flu. One of my big concerns right now is students passing it on to educators like myself. I'm coming home to a wife and we are expecting our first child this November.The CDC has also pointed out that women that are in their third trimester of pregnancy are at huge risk and that's where she's going to be. I think of teachers that have taught with that are overcoming cancer and a lot of other illnesses. And for me, you know, I want the economy open just like everybody else, I want to eat meals with my friends. I want to be able to stand next to a student whenever they're struggling with something.I don't think you're going to find any teachers who are going to say I don't want to be back in school. But for me, my value on human life is much higher than the need to currently open up the education system in an in-person format. Schools didn't close last spring, you know, teachers continue to work tirelessly.MACCALLUM: Yes.STRUNK: And we'll continue to work tirelessly this fall.MACCALLUM: Leigha, what do you think?LEIGHA PHILLIPS, HIGH SCHOOL ENGLISH TEACHER: I mean, I agree with a lot of what they are saying especially if I were working with the young kids, I'd be concerned. I've got a nine, four, and 2-year-old, and I know that keeping their hands to themselves and keeping masks on can be hard so I really empathize especially with our elementary school teachers, middle schoolers aren't much different in all honesty.Just like Phil said, I am worried about my high school kids transmitting it whether it's between themselves, giving it to me and me taking at home, me giving it to my elderly grandma. So, I would love to be in school and I would love to see a hybrid work but that takes a lot of work and a lot of resources that not all districts have and are able to do in such a short time.MACCALLUM: I mean, we've had, you know, the whole summer, or really since March to be adapting to this, there's been hundreds of millions of dollars that went out in the CARE Act to help schools get ready for this and prepare.One of the things that President Trump said had to do with, you know, reallocating money if the schools choose not to open in the face of these guidelines, here's what he said about that.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: If schools are not reopened, the funding should go to parents to send their child to public-private, charter, religious, or homeschool of their choice.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: So, Krista, some schools will open, should parents have the option to use the tax dollars that are allocated to their child to send them someplace else that is open if they want them in school?HERRIN: I think that it's a parent's choice as to where they want their child to go and what they feel would be the best for their family. But I know that more public educators they want the best for what their student needs and they want them to be safe. And so, no matter what the outcome is, the community needs to come together and support the teachers that are trying to do their best.MACCALLUM: What about remote learning, Phil? We've heard a lot that over all, especially for children in urban environments, in inner-city environments, that remote learning has been a failure.STRUNK: Yes, remote learning is going to be challenging no matter what, and I think the other teachers on this panel would agree with me whenever I'd say none of us would suggest remote learning or anything like that because it's easier or better for students, we all know being in a classroom with kids is what's the best option.MACCALLUM: Yes.STRUNK: But again, we're facing an unprecedented time with this pandemic that's killing thousands of people. At this point, I think in the interest of safety, that kind of has to take the top priority, that way we can bring more students back into the classroom in the safe format.MACCALLUM: What about, Leigha, before I let you go, quickly if you can, you know, these studies that show that kids are actually they are in more danger in school than they are staying home. There's instances of abuse, there's difficulties at home, there are things that you don't pick up on necessarily if you don't get to see that child in school every day, does that danger outweigh the virus?PHILLIPS: It's a hard question --(CROSSTALK)STRUNK: I think, you know, they aren't --MACCALLUM: Leigha, if you can. Thanks.PHILLIPS: Yes.STRUNK: Sorry.PHILLIPS: I'm not sure you can weigh -- I'm not sure you can weigh what's more important, a life or a life filled with pain and abuse. I mean, it's a valid point, and it's a concerning point. I know my colleagues and I are all concerned with, but I think there gets to be a point when society and the community has placed too much of a burden on schools to be the police of what's happening, to be the counselors, to do all of these different things.I think that employers, I think the community, and I think all stakeholders need to have an impact on that and need to step up and kind of fill in the gaps where kids are going to struggleMACCALLUM: Yes.PHILLIPS: -- because their life isn't worth it.(CROSSTALK)MACCALLUM: A lot of -- a lot of people are very concerned, you know, if they stay home for another semester or God forbid to the whole school year, all of the loss of learning could be devastating, it could really set a lot of these kids back for a long time.So, I thank you all for your dedication and for sharing your thoughts with us on this today. Leigha, Krista, and Phil, all the best to you as you head forward towards the school year.PHILLIPS: Thank you.MACCALLUM: Thank you very much.STRUNK: Thank you, Martha.MACCALLUM: Thank you.So, coming up, there has been a lot of talk about a violent crime surging in Chicago and New York, but the city of Detroit is also seeing a 29 percent increase in homicides this year. Detroit based Pulitzer Prize winning journalist Charlie LeDuff on whether the feds need to protect his city, next.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: Well, I'm going to do something, that I can tell you. Because we're not going to let New York, and Chicago, and Philadelphia, and Detroit, and Baltimore and all of these -- all cleaned. It's a mess. We're not going to let this happen in our country.(END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: Chicago should be calling us and so should Philadelphia and Detroit and others, to go in and really help them. Because when you're losing many people a weekend, many, many people, you see the same numbers as I do. When you're losing these people, they should call us and they should say come on in.And it's incredible to me but they're not doing it. At some point, they will. At some point we may have no other choice but to go in.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: So, with violent crime on the rise now in Detroit as well, President Trump hinting that it could be among the cities that receive some help from federal officers under the new Operation Legend that was announced yesterday.Homicides there are up 29 percent, and you know, good estimates. I think our next guests will tell us it's higher than that. Nonfatal shootings are up 52 percent over the same period last year, and over the weekend, there were 33 shooting incidents leaving 26 people injured and seven dead.Charlie LeDuff has covered Detroit extensively, he's a Pulitzer Prize winning journalist and says that the increase in crime is historical. He is the author of \"S Show\" there you go. \"This Country is Collapsing but the Ratings Are Great.\"Charlie, always good to see you. Thank you very much for being here.CHARLIE LEDUFF, AUTHOR, \"SH*TSHOW\": The title is still true, Martha.MACCALLUM: So, is the -- what's the answer here? Who needs to come in to help the situation in Detroit, what's the mayor doing about it?LEDUFF: What are they doing about it? First of all, we've had five mass shootings in two weeks, two quadruples, two quintuples, and a nine tuple. So, I don't know what this package is that the president is sending. Are you sending 10 agents? A 100 agents? A thousand? Because our own chief of police says he needs another thousand cops at least.So, we've entered into agreements with them -- they haven't really work what we have task force. ATF, FBI, DEA, the relationship between the Detroit police and the DEA is rotten, it's done. The chief threw them out because of an informant in January who went on a rampage and killed six people. So, I'd like to see some specifics.

And I don't -- nobody seriously thinks you should defund the police because as we talked about before, we've already done it and look what's happening. And remember, in the next couple of days, those $600 super unemployment checks run out, then what happens?MACCALLUM: So, you heard the president, you know, he talks about sending help. Right?LEDUFF: Yes.MACCALLUM: You say that the police aren't doing their job because they are afraid of the ramifications, you talk about sending in state troopers. You know, what do you think having lived there and worked there and watched all of this, is there a solution that's going to make people safer on the streets?LEDUFF: I think we're in for a slog here, I think you know it and I think the country knows it, the police do do their jobs, there's not enough police to do it and some are afraid to do it. But just last week they pulled 106 guns off of 117 arrestees. Guns are everywhere, what could the governor do? She's not even talking about it, right? She's busy tweeting with the president.Madam, put the state police on the major thoroughfares in the city, seven- mile, six-mile, McNichols, Finco (Ph), five-mile, Telegraph, let them patrol the main boulevards so the police can be in the neighborhoods. That's one way to do it. We've got more state troopers than the president is sending federal agents.MACCALLUM: So, she's way ahead in job performance, she's at 64 percent. President Trump is at 45 percent in Michigan, what do you say about that before we go?LEDUFF: Well, we don't have a very rabid media in this state. You, I think we'll all notice she's got a lot of softball questions. She doesn't get good marks for the nursing homes, she hasn't addressed that. The Senate today voted to take COVID positive people out of nursing homes and have their own facilities.MACCALLUM: That's a good idea.LEDUFF: It's bipartisan. And she's threatening to veto it. And I got to go, Martha. That's all the time I have.MACCALLUM: All right, Charlie, thank you. Come back soon. Always good to talk to you. Best of luck.LEDUFF: Thank you.MACCALLUM: More of The Story coming up next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)MACCALLUM: You don't want to miss this in the latest episode of the Untold Story podcast.

And this was the way to do it,\u201d the report added, quoting a former U.S. government official.The new powers gave the CIA more latitude to \u201cdamage adversaries\u2019 critical infrastructure, such as petrochemical plants, and to engage in the kind of hack-and-dump operations that Russian hackers and WikiLeaks popularized,\u201d the report explained. The hack-and-dump tactic involves leaking stolen documents or data to journalists or posting it on the Internet.Initially, the Obama administration considered retaliating against Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election by using hack-and-dump but, in the end, the CIA was told to \u201cstand down,\u201d the report stated.John Bolton\u2019s appointment as the National Security Adviser in the Trump administration changed that, Yahoo News reported, citing a passage in Bolton\u2019s memoir, \u201cThe Room Where It Happened.\u201dIn September 2018, the White House announced a new national cybersecurity strategy to bolster the government\u2019s defenses against foreign adversaries.While cyber-defense was central to the strategy, Bolton also called for a better offense. \u201cWe\u2019re going to do a lot of things offensively and I think our adversaries need to know that,\u201d John Bolton told reporters at the time, according to .\u201cWe will identify, counter, disrupt, degrade, and deter behavior in cyberspace that is destabilizing and contrary to national interests, while preserving the United States\u2019 overmatch in and through cyberspace,\u201d Bolton added.Another change that came with the presidential finding was the\u00a0lowering of the bar for \u201cevidentiary requirements,\u201d thereby expanding the CIA\u2019s ability to conduct covert cyber operations against \u201cmedia organizations, charities, religious institutions or businesses believed to be working on behalf of adversaries\u2019 foreign intelligence services,\u201d the report added.", "comment": "(1,037)", "topic": "CIA", "date": " July 16"}, {"cover": "https://a57.foxnews.com/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/694940094001/2a2ed733-612e-4083-b213-4d0ab9884338/bb85d767-0a7d-4a15-adb8-18ff3478a7cb/1280x720/match/156/88/image.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "title": "Giuliani calls Biden a pathological liar and a big crook: I can't understand how he's running for president", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/transcript/giuliani-calls-biden-a-pathological-liar-and-a-big-crook-i-cant-understand-how-hes-running-for-president", "subtitle": "Guests: Steve Bannon, Rudy Giuliani, Corey Lewandowski, Daniel Halper, Pam Bondi", "keyword": "China and the world order", "website": "Fox News", "author": "", "content": "JESSE WATTERS, HOST: Welcome to \"Watters' World,\"\u00a0I'm Jesse Watters.Staying focused: that's the subject of tonight's Watters' Words. Don't fall for the Roger Stone hysteria, just a distraction, just like the Russia bounty story.The president's power to commute sentences almost absolute. George Washington granted clemency to traitors. Andrew Johnson pardoned every single Confederate soldier. Gerald Ford pardon Nixon. Bill Clinton pardoned his own brother. That's what brothers are for. Bill Clinton pardoned the former C.I.A. Director and his business partner, Susan McDougal, and he pardoned the biggest tax cheat in U.S. history, international fugitive, Mark Rich after Rich's wife donated a half a million to Clinton's presidential library.Barack Obama commuted the sentence of Chelsea Manning, who conspired with WikiLeaks and the media loved it.But Trump commuted the sentence of Roger Stone who did not conspire with WikiLeaks and the media hated it. See what's going on here? There was never any evidence of collusion because there was never any collusion. Nobody has ever been charged with collusion or conspiracy with the Russians.Stone was charged in order to cover up a corrupt investigation. Trump's campaign was framed by the Democrats, the C.I.A. and the crooked F.B.I. agents we all know and love.They planted in doctored evidence. They used spies and foreign agents. They illegally leaked hatch stings and got caught.What happened was this. Roger Stone refused to get framed, so they tried to put them in jail. Stone refused to make up dirt about Trump, so they charged him with crimes. How sick is that?If police plant a gun on you, and then you throw it in the river, you shouldn't be charged with obstruction. That's basically what Mueller's boys did here.Stone should have just acid washed his hard drive like Hillary, right? Apparently, that's totally fine.If you tell your buddy not to cooperate with crooked cops because you're being framed, you shouldn't be charged with witness tampering. That's what they did to Stone.And Stone's buddy testified he was never even intimidated by Stone. They charged him with making false statements. You know, easy it is for the Feds to make that charge? That's the same charge they slapped General Mike Flynn with. Now, and new notes we just saw that the F.B.I. released to show that the F.B.I. didn't even think Flynn was lying.Stone told a so-called lie to Congress, but James Clapper can lie and get away with it. McCabe can lie to investigators and that's okay. Congress can lie to you, but you'll get locked up for lying to Congress.Schiff lied for three years that he had evidence of collusion -- false. But Stone said, I didn't collude -- true -- and he gets charged. You can't cover up a crime that never happened. Crooked investigations only produced crooked charges.You can't frame innocent people, investigate them for crimes they didn't commit, and then lock them up when they refuse to go along with your show trial.The jury foreman in the Stone trial was a raging Trump hater also. She was a member of the resistance. She is all over social media disparaging Donald Trump, she hates him, but she lies her way onto the jury and gets caught covering up her bias, so the jury is tainted, right? No. The Obama appointed judge is okay with it. What a joke.Now, I'll be honest. Stone is no saint. He has been playing in the gutter for decades. It doesn't make him a criminal though. He's just a political operator, and somewhat of an opportunist.There's guys like Stone all over the political world, on the left and on the right. Hillary paid for an operative millions to interfere in the election and smear Trump with Russian disinformation. She bought a warrant so Obama could spy on the Trump campaign. It was all fake. But the media doesn't talk about that, because they were in on it. That's 10 times worse than what they say Stone did.Now, I also don't want to hear Democrats in the media crowing about the rule of law either. As I said before, pardon power is perfectly legal. But here's the point, the left spent the last two months looking the other way at looting and encouraging mobs to rip down the public property in the middle of the night, statues.'The left let radicals create their own country in the middle of Seattle and didn't make a move on it until after two black Americans were murdered. The rule of law -- really?Biden's son was bribed by the Chinese and the Ukrainians. The Saudis were sending Clinton's foundation millions, then they murdered someone in their Embassy. Did Hillary send the money back?Did Comey uphold the rule of law when the F.B.I. doctored evidence to illegally spy on the Trump campaign?A Mexican national can illegally cross the border, commit a crime in San Francisco, and the city won't let I.C.E. pick him up and deport him. That's respecting the rule of law?The Democrats believe in mob rule, not the rule of law. That's why they're waging a war on the First and the Second Amendments. That's why when they tried to impeach the President, they jumped over the judicial system and rushed their case to the Senate instead.The media wants an old man to catch COVID-19 in prison and die behind bars. Really? They want hardcore felons sprung from jail so they don't get sick. But want a Republican with no prior record to rot and drop dead.The left is just mad because Trump sniffed out there witch hunt and stopped it.These were processed crimes and a baseless and politically motivated investigation. This was a dirty tricks hit job on Trump, because he was a threat to their power. They tried to criminalize the movement because it put America first.The movement put the people over the politicians, the swamp is going after Trump because they're really going after you, the voters, because you put him there.Trump represents change, the change you voted for, getting out of Syria, rebuilding America instead of Afghanistan, putting a stop to the Germans ripping us off, challenging the Chinese government thieves, shredding the dumb climate and trade deals, securing the border for American workers and keeping judges out of our business and politicians' hands out of our pockets.Stone is small potatoes compared to the stakes of the election. Free Stone, free Flynn, let Durham indict some bad guys, but we have to stop looking in the rear view mirror.The election is less than four months away. There's only three issues: jobs, China and Biden, a dangerous buffoon who is going to destroy everything Americans have been working towards.Trump is the jobs President. Biden is the mob president. Trump was elected because he was a businessman who was looking out for the working man after the Obama-Biden regime let foreign nations and illegal immigrants steal jobs -- good paying jobs, especially manufacturing jobs that were roaring back until the Chinese communists let the virus escape out of Wuhan into the world.The Chinese government lied, covered it up, hoarded masks, gouged us and then blamed us.Trump needs to confront China and rally the country around Made in the U.S.A. and hold the communists accountable.Bringing factories out of China and back to the America puts the foreign policy and the economic policy together. Protecting America from COVID-19 and punishing the source keeps Americans safe and focused.And now it's time to define Biden. He's a fool who can't be trusted with power. He's been a Washington politician his whole life and put America last during the Cold War and the war on terror.He let China and the Europeans eat our lunch while the forgotten men and women suffered. He never protected us from criminal illegals or ISIS, and he doesn't have the spine to stand up to the Bernie bros, AOC, Pelosi, Antifa, or the mob.Biden is an economic illiterate who lets lobbyists and the globalists write the rules and rig the game. Even his family members take advantage of Joe, because he's an easy mark.But don't let folksy good old Joe fool you. It is just a slick sales job by the pros. Biden's an empty suit for socialism.So the Trump campaign should be hammering away at what really matters. Boom, boom, boom. It's right there for the taking. No more distractions.Let's finish writing the American comeback story. There's not a lot of time left.Reaction to that in a moment, but first breaking news in China's coronavirus cover up. Here with that, former Trump White House chief strategist, Steve Bannon, the host of the podcast \"War Room Pandemic.\"All right, Steve, what are your sources telling you about Chinese covering up the virus?STEVE BANNON, FORMER WHITE HOUSE CHIEF STRATEGIST: Well, we know we're starting to have, Jesse, doctors, actually people associated with the Hong Kong lab and people associated with Wuhan, people associated with their entire biomedical and bio weapons defense industry start to defect and start to get information. There's a massive whistleblower campaign in China right now.People have to understand that Chinese people are the victims of the Chinese Communist Party. They've been the victims of this CCP virus, and they're starting to tell the story.Fox News broke an incredible story, I think it was yesterday with Dr. Yan, who is the first of many that are going to start to come out. Some of them are already out in Europe, the United Kingdom and other places.And you're going to start to see now the Intelligence agencies, the F.B.I., others start to put this together of what the real source of this virus was, how culpable the Chinese Communist Party is about this virus, particularly what they visited on their people and what they visited on the people in the United States.The Chinese Communist Party lied, 130,000 Americans died. We have an economic inferno in our country, an economic inferno around the world. We've blown up the balance sheets of the Federal Reserve and everybody else to try to bridge this in a smart way.That is all the responsibility of the Chinese Communist Party. They have to be held accountable, I think you're going to see a lot more Dr. Yan's start to come forward, and I think she's got a lot more to say.WATTERS: Oh, yes. So the defections are going to blow the lid off this thing. And the President needs to be much more aggressive in the way he confronts the Communist Chinese because they need to pay a price.Americans need to see them paying a price and they need to feel it, because that's going to unite the country around a common goal.So, what did you think about my analysis about the stakes in the election in terms of the economic policy, merging that with the foreign policy, and then defining Joe Biden as the bumbling buffoon that he is?BANNON: That that's the playbook right there. Look, the tell was the other day when Joe Biden who is the senator from Wilmington, Delaware, remember, he represents all the global corporations. He's been the biggest globalist in the Senate for 40 years.He pushed W.T.O. for the Chinese. He pushed most favored nation. He pushed NAFTA. You know, Chuck Todd said yesterday on an interview, it is kind of stunning to see Joe Biden trying to recreate himself as an economic populist and an economic nationalist.The reason is, that's where the country is. Donald Trump is a populist. He's an economic nationalist. He is the first President to confront China. But there's so much more to do.Right now in Hong Kong, President Trump ought to drop the hammer. That is Czechoslovakia in 1938. President Trump ought to cut them off from the U.S. dollar. He ought to sanction Hong Kong Shanghai Bank, Bank of China, CITIC, Penang Group, then ought to sanction individuals, Wang Xin and I think he ought to sanction President Xi.WATTERS: Wow.BANNON: President Trump ought to throw down. President Trump ought to throw down. Look, the Chinese Communist Party, they did this because he had built a striver's economy, it wasn't going to be pushed around.The Chinese Communist Party, coming out of that weapons lab and hiding it. We now know and Dr. Yan gives you a detailed analysis of how the Beijing C.D.C. knew this back in late December, early January of 2020, late December 2019.What she told Fox the other day is explosive, every paper in the world has picked it up -- I think you're just at the top of the first thing with her and there are many more like her that are going to start coming forward.Remember, people in China are decent and hardworking folks. They understand the brutality of the Chinese Communist Party. They understand that they are bad guys in a totalitarian dictatorship, and you're going to see, Jesse, many more things coming out.But I think you laid out the playbook. What I would tell the President, it is action, action, action. You're the protagonist in this drama.WATTERS: Right.BANNON: Drive the action. All Joe Biden could do is try -- Joe Biden has got to recreate himself in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan or Wisconsin. Those are your voters, Mr. President. Just complete -- drop the hammer. More Executive Orders on buy American and hire American.Remember, Joe Biden wants to give amnesty to 20 million illegals that will flood the workforce that will suppress wages for African-Americans and Hispanics. He also wants to have full medical benefits for illegal aliens. This will crush the budget.President Trump is both buy American and hire American, and now is the time, I think to drop the hammer on jobs, on China, on sinking the American way of life.WATTERS: Yes, and Sleepy Joe just completely plagiarized that out of the Donald Trump playbook.You've zeroed in on something that I don't think a lot of people realize though. So the Senator from Delaware -- Delaware is the state where all of the multinational corporations incorporate for tax purposes. So, he's been doing their bidding for decades, and that's what this is all about.The guy is just a car and he is being driven by powers that don't have the best interest of the American worker at heart and Donald Trump needs to point that out day after day after day.Now, strategically, when you have Joe Biden hiding in the basement, for a while, I thought maybe you know what, he is surviving in the basement. You know, maybe Donald Trump needs to smoke him out.And now I'm thinking, you know what? Let him stay in the basement. Let him not travel to swing states. Let him get rusty. Let him not see the country and just have them just roll in the debates, not in fighting shape thinking he's going to win like a boxer that doesn't train because the Vegas bookmakers have him ahead a few points. What do you think?BANNON: Look, I think that's one strategy. I also think if you want to smoke him out, it is not going to be rhetoric. You're going to smoke him out with action. Action, action, action on jobs, on EOs about jobs.Biden's line he tried to use in the present is that, all you care about is the stock market and the investor class. That's the biggest chutzpah I've ever seen.It was Joe Biden and Barack Obama that in their administration, we had the greatest concentration of wealth in world history from the crash of 2008 until Donald Trump took the oath of office. Donald Trump's economy, although we had a robust stock market, Donald Trump's economy was a striver's economy.Remember, it's the first time that working class people's wages were increasing more than people with college degrees. That's what we had before he --WATTERS: Donald Trump actually decreased the income inequality that was exacerbated during the Obama-Biden years. You know, everything's backwards, but I think -- I think that the playbook is out there to win this thing. It just needs to be simple and strong and you know, relentless day after day after day. Look, no tie band and I'm pulling the band look. What do you think?BANNON: Jesse, he's a man of action. He's a man of action.WATTERS: Right.BANNON: Jesse, all we need is action, action, action. Let Joe Biden try to recreate you himself when you're the guy you are. Thanks, Jesse.WATTERS: All right, thanks, Steve.Joe Biden, plagiarizing President Trump's economic plan. Here we go again. Up next, Rudy Giuliani on that.And later, the Epstein tapes starring some very famous politicians. A new bombshell accusation from a jewel thief.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BIDEN: I went to law school on a full academic scholarship. The only one in my class to have a full academic scholarship. I went back to law school and in fact ended up in the top half of my class.I was the outstanding student in the Political Science Department at the end of my year. I graduated with three degrees from undergraduate school and 165 credits, only had 123 credits.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Biden now concedes he did not graduate in the top half of his law school class, that he does not have three degrees from college, and that he was not named outstanding political science student in college.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: \"Newsweek\" says Biden actually went to school on a half scholarship, ended up near the bottom of his class and earned only one degree, not three.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: That was Joe Biden years ago taking credit for things he didn't actually do. And he is at it again. He's just unveiled his plan for the economy and guess who it sounds just like?(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BIDEN: When the Federal government spends taxpayers' money, we should use it to buy American products and support American jobs.PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: In my administration, we live by two simple rules, buy American and hire American.Buy American and hire American.Buy American and hire American.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Even the name of this original economic idea, stolen. The slogan, Build Back Better was used by the United Nations back in April.Joining me now, former New York City mayor and President Trump's personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani. You know, we better be careful, he might start saying Make America Great Again.RUDY GIULIANI, PRESIDENT TRUMP'S PERSONAL ATTORNEY: I mean, Jesse, to listen to that is -- I can't understand how he is running for President.WATTERS: Me neither.GIULIANI: The first time I heard about Joe Biden was about 33 years ago. One of his law school classmates was my colleague in the U.S. Attorney's Office, eventually my Chief of Staff when I was Associate Attorney General, and he said to me, you should run for the Senate in Delaware. I said, why?He said, because anybody can get elected. Joe Biden was in my law school class. He was the dumbest guy in the class. He cheated his way through law school. He plagiarized at least once and cheated about four or five times.He's a nice guy, but he is so dumb it is going to take your breath away.And I've known him over the years and every time he'd make one of these mistakes, I would think about what I was told that he was dumb.And then of course, he plagiarized again. Remember when he plagiarized Neil Kinnock, he didn't just plagiarize him, he plagiarized his life.WATTERS: Yes.GIULIANI: He said that his family had never had anyone who graduated from college. They did. He said that they had worked in coal mines all their lives. Only one had worked for a coal mining company as an accountant. He completely plagiarized a man's life.The man is a pathological liar. He obviously has some kind of dementia or Alzheimer's. It's clear.And finally, I happen to know, he is a big crook. The family has been taking money for 30 years. They sell his office. They sold this office in Iraq. They sold his office in Ukraine, and they made a fortune in China.And you know, he always claims, well, I don't know. Meanwhile, his brother is becoming a millionaire. His son who is afflicted with unfortunately with drug addiction becomes a multimillionaire. And this money is for them. Of course, it's for Joe. It's to buy Joe's influence.And then he fixed the case in Ukraine, which the American media is covering up and attacking me over it, rather than going after the criminal, Joe Biden and his family.The guy is a total -- he is a total creation. I mean, it's like --WATTERS: Yes, but Joe Biden is a hot mess and everybody knows it, Mayor.GIULIANI: And now --WATTERS: And now you remember, he comes out and says, don't defund the police. Now, he has changed his tune. Now, he says, we need to redirect money away from the police, almost Clinton-esque. Listen to this soundbite.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BIDEN: Surplus military equipment for law enforcement. They don't need that. The last thing you need is an up armored Humvee coming into a neighborhood. It's like the military invading.They don't know anybody, they become the enemy. They're supposed to be protecting these people.So my generic point is that --UNIDENTIFIED MALE: But do we agree that we can redirect some of the funding?BIDEN: Yes, absolutely.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: So Joe has always been a patsy for the left. He was pulled away left on abortion, on energy, on reparations during the primary and now, he is getting pulled left again by the defund the police movement.I think the President just wants to pin him down on these things in the swing states.GIULIANI: Well, I mean, I worked with him on the Crime Bill of 1994 that provided 100,000 more police. So, this is a totally -- but I mean, I don't think Joe Biden actually at this point, even really understands completely what he is saying, which is really frightening.I mean, the Democratic Party is so cynical, they're running an incompetent -- mentally incompetent human being for President of the United States, which is similar to Mueller.I mean, they got a guy who doesn't have everything going, and they can use him like a patsy, and he is a patsy. He'll say anything AOC wants. He will -- this guy was pro-police.WATTERS: Yes.GIULIANI: Now, he wants to defund the police, which is part of the Marxist Black Lives Matter program, which, by the way is funded by a convicted terrorist, who I happen to convict, Susan Rosenberg who got 58 years in jail and was corruptly pardoned by Bill Clinton.The woman should be in jail right now. She was involved with the Black Panthers who floated police officers. So please don't be fooled by Black Lives Matter.Maybe a fool like Biden can be fooled by it. But intelligent people like the people listening to you should take a look at the three Marxist who founded it, and the terrorist who is funding it.WATTERS: And a lot of that money, you know, when you donate to Black Lives Matter does end up going to the Biden people because it goes through this little wholesale website.GIULIANI: It goes right through a terrorist. The money actually goes right through the terrorist.WATTERS: Exactly. So Joe has been taken advantage of by his family. He has been taken advantage of by the far left, he's been taken advantage of by China and other countries.Can you imagine the level of racketeering and corruption and swindling that's going to go on while Joe is in the White House, not knowing up from down? It's going to be a free for all on the American people. I'll give you the last word.GIULIANI: Well, you know, the only reason I can think that his family is letting him run is because they want to steal more money. They've already stolen millions and sold out the American people. If that were my father or brother, I'd take them off television.I would I would say, hey, Joe, it's time to throw in the towel.WATTERS: Yes, it's elder abuse. A lot of people say that.GIULIANI: You don't make sense anymore. You're making -- but unless, unless, unless I was a greedy crook, and I was looking to make even more money. I mean, they have made about $40 million or $50 million off of him.WATTERS: Yes.GIULIANI: Selling his office.WATTERS: No one wants to report --GIULIANI: They are selling out America.WATTERS: No one wants to report that.GIULIANI: Nobody wants to report it.WATTERS: Where's Hunter? That's all I'm -- where is Hunter, by the way, who knows?GIULIANI: It was never about Hunter. It was about bribing Joe.WATTERS: I know. I know. He is just a conduit. Exactly. He's the go between.All right, Rudy Giuliani, thank you very much.GIULIANI: Thank you.WATTERS: Liberals start the dumbest boycott ever, if you can believe it. Details ahead on that.And the government goes into the home of that St. Louis couple and seizes their rifle. Outrageous.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)JACKIE IBANEZ, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT: Live from \"America's News Headquarters,\" I'm Jackie Ibanez in New York. President Trump drawing harsh criticism for commuting the sentence of political confidante, Roger Stone.Democrats and even a few Republicans are calling for an investigation. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi saying legislation is needed to keep this from happening in the future, calling President Trump's actions quote, \"an act of staggering corruption.\"Meanwhile, presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, Joe Biden defining what his presidency would look like. Biden is pledging a sweeping economic agenda, saying it will go beyond anything Americans have seen since the Great Depression and the industrial mobilization for World War II.Biden is also promising to counter centuries of institutional racism.I'm Jackie Ibanez, now back to \"Watters' World.\"For all of your headlines, you can always log on to foxnews.com. You're watching the most powerful name in news, Fox News Channel. Have a great night.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)ROBERT UNANUE, CEO, GOYA FOODS: We're all truly blessed at the same time to have a leader like President Trump who is a builder. We pray for our leadership, our President, and we pray for our country.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Praise for President Trump from the CEO of Goya Foods sparking calls for a boycott from liberals. Imagine that. But that CEO refusing to apologize.Here with reaction Trump 2020 campaign senior adviser, Corey Lewandowski. Corey, like the top three inexpensive meals in this country for families, you have barbecue, you have pizza and you have tacos.There is no way the American people are not going into the grocery store, that little Goya Taka kit. They're not boycotting that. That would be like me boycotting hair gel.COREY LEWANDOWSKI, FORMER TRUMP CAMPAIGN MANAGER: You know, Jesse, look, I hope every person who supports this President and loves their country goes out and buys some of their products.You know, this guy, the only word that comes to mind for me is cojones. This guy stood up to the left. Right? I don't know Spanish, Jesse, but I think that means that that guy is tough. Okay.And what that means is when he went and saw President Clinton, I'm sorry, President Obama at the White House, he was praised. He was jeered. He was a CEO that everyone should admire and respect. He goes and sees President Trump in the Rose Garden, and all of a sudden, you know, the left want to boycott him.This is the hypocrisy of the media, and I think the Trump train is going to come through and Goya's profits are going to go through the roof because of it.WATTERS: Yes. I mean, if you look around out there, I don't think Americans are giving up any meals, if you know what I mean.This reminds me of what Kanye West said the other day, Corey. He was talking about how the Democratic Party uses threats to coerce minorities into staying in the Democratic camp, and this is what that is again.Instead of persuading minority business owners with results or words, they're trying to go after their bottom line with intimidation. That's because the liberals have failed the minority community. And so they have to keep them in line with threats like this.LEWANDOWSKI: Well, Jesse, there's two approaches always. There is the carrot approach and the stick approach and the Democrats always want to use the stick, which is we're going to go after you if you even step out of line or you have an independent thought.Here's what the President has said, I'm going to deregulate the government so you can grow your business regardless of how you own it. I'm going to have empowerment zone, so we're going to put more money into minority communities.This President uses the carrot. It's two very different ways of doing things. We know the President's way works, but if you're not on Team Liberal, if you're not on Team AOC, you're not on Team Hate Trump, then we're going to use the stick against you and you'll be penalized for not supporting the Democratic line.WATTERS: Yes, Corey. I think they're scared because the President is making strong inroads in the Hispanic community. He is up 10 points to where I guess he was against Crooked Hillary. Biden is losing support with Hispanics. So they have to use these types of threats and this boycott movement.Cancel culture, Corey. That's what this is about. You've been canceled before, haven't you? You're always getting canceled.LEWANDOWSKI: Jesse, it looks like we canceled your time tonight. Look, Rudy and I are the only guys who bring in a class to the show.Between you and Bannon, you couldn't find a tie tonight? You guys got canceled on the tie.WATTERS: Sloppy Watters. That's what they call me.LEWANDOWSKI: No, good, Jesse. No, good.WATTERS: All right. I'll try to clean it up next week. Corey Lewandowski, everybody. Thank you.LEWANDOWSKI: Thank you.WATTERS: A liberal prosecutor sends police into the home of this St. Louis couple to take away their weapon. This is what the founders warned us about. A full report ahead on that.But first, a jewel thief says the Epstein tapes are real and he's seen them, next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WATTERS: New claims coming out about Ghislaine Maxwell from a jewel thief. He says Maxwell bragged about having video of at least two high profile politicians and other powerful figures, and that he has seen the tapes himself.An attorney for Prince Andrew accuser, Virginia Roberts says the Prince is one of them, and Roberts says, he should be worried.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)VIRGINIA ROBERTS GIUFFRE, JEFFREY EPSTEIN ACCUSER: We weren't anything important to them at all. We weren't even a human being to them. We were just another toy to be passed around. And that's what they did.Prince Andrew should be panicking at the moment because Ghislaine doesn't really care about anyone else but Ghislaine.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: So who else should be worried? Joining me now, Daniel Halper, co- author of the book \"A Convenient Death: The Mysterious Demise of Jeffrey Epstein.\" I've read it. It's excellent reporting by him and his co-author.All right, so this guy is a jewel thief. You can kind of judge the veracity for yourself. He told a tabloid in Great Britain about this. So this is what he said.He said, you know, Ghislaine and Epstein kind of boasted to him about owning powerful people. He said he saw videos of powerful people, celebrities, world figures, in videos having sex, threesomes, even orgies with minors. He saw videos and photos of people having sex with various young girls, and there is footage of two very high profile society figures with an underage girl and the two American politicians in videos with minors.You've done some reporting on Epstein and Ghislaine, what do you make of this, Daniel?DANIEL HALPER, AUTHOR: Well, listen, I can't vouch for his precise claims, obviously, but it's very consistent with what we know. We know that Ghislaine Maxwell was a procurer for Jeffrey Epstein. That's been alleged by many victims.And we know, worse that she partook in the sexual crimes against these women in many cases.I think one thing to consider is that Ghislaine Maxwell herself was found in America, and I think it's a very striking point. Why was she here in America when she had two other passports, in addition to an American passport? She had $20 million. She could have gotten anywhere in the world.And I think the answer is pretty obvious. She didn't fear getting caught here. She hadn't gotten caught for so long. The Feds had showed no interest in her for so long, and she had gotten away with her crimes.She clearly has something over some powerful people's heads that was able - - that allowed her to run free for so long. And I think it's very good that she is being brought to justice and hopefully, she does cooperate with prosecutors and they try to get to the bottom of this.WATTERS: Yes, I mean, she's in a horrible cell in a correctional facility, and they're not going to let anything happen to her after the mistake they made with Epstein.So, you've reported and other people have reported that every single property he owned from Paris to the Virgin Islands, in Mexico, Palm Beach to Manhattan was wired. Like this was like the real world house. This was this -- this was like, you know, the \"Big Brother.\" You have cameras in every single corner.So if you're a high profile individual and you ever went to an Epstein property over the last couple decades, and you did anything inappropriate with any underage person, there will be surveillance footage backed up somewhere on a hard drive which we have to assume the F.B.I. seized during their raids when they went after Jeffrey and took him into custody.The amount of explosive evidence that we're looking at here, and if this really is true that you're talking about well-known politicians and society types, does she have leverage if the F.B.I. already has the tapes? I guess the only leverage would be that she could testify against people.HALPER: Yes, look that's obviously a legal question. And then of course, there may be other situations of which there's not footage. There were accusations that some of these things took place in Ohio, for instance, that we don't -- that there hasn't been alleged that it is very well wired.I think one of the interesting things about Jeffrey Epstein's wiring of his place and a lot of victims and friends of his have claimed that is that Jeffrey Epstein would allow people at some point to know that they were filmed and that they were wired.It's very interesting. It wasn't just that he had everything on camera. He wanted people to know and I think he did it.WATTERS: Well, let me ask you this because you did some reporting quickly about questions about his ties to foreign intelligence activities. Ghislaine's father was alleged to have had some sort of ties to Israeli Intelligence, I think you reported.There's always been questions about Epstein's role in compromising people for a foreign country. Do these tapes kind of lead you to believe that?HALPER: They've led many people to believe that. I think there are very serious questions. Why did he evade the law for so long and people like Alex Acosta, when he was coming into the Trump administration, he told people in the Trump administration allegedly that he couldn't touch Epstein because he was tied to Intelligence.WATTERS: Wow.HALPER: So I think Bill Barr should be transparent about what's going on, given what's happened to Jeffrey Epstein. I think we should know what's going on, and I think that would be very helpful in getting justice hopefully.WATTERS: Yes. Because that's what this is about. This is about justice for these underage victims.All right, great reporting. Dan. Thanks again.HALPER: Thank you, Jesse.WATTERS: St. Louis homeowners have their rifle removed from their home by force. A dark day for the Bill of Rights in America. That shocking story, next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MARK MCCLOSKEY, ST. LOUIS MAN WHO DEFENDED HIS HOME: Seemingly, everybody in the world came forward. Literally, I think the estimate is 300 to 500 people came right towards us.PATRICIA MCCLOSKEY, ST. LOUIS WOMAN WHO DEFENDED HIS HOME: They were going to kill us. They were going to come in there. They were going to burn down the house. They were going to be living in our house after I was dead and they were going to -- they pointed to two different rooms and set up, that's going to be my bedroom, and that's going to be the living room and I'm going to be taking a shower in that room.And then the dog barked. I mean, there were so many threats and then the dog barked and they said and I'm going to be killing her, too.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Patricia and Mark McCloskey, the St. Louis couple forced to protect their home from protesters now unarmed. Police went into their home and took their rifle, and the pistol reportedly already handed over to their former attorney.But the couple was not arrested or charged. So what the heck is going on here? Joining me now with that by phone, former Florida Attorney General, Pam Bondi.So Pam, this crackpot DA out in St. Louis. She is running in a primary for re-election. She's a total joke. And I guess she got a judge to sign off on a warrant to send police in there to take this guy's rifle away from him. It's very unclear for what reason. This is like the red flag law without the red flag. How is this legal in this country?PAM BONDI, FORMER FLORIDA ATTORNEY GENERAL (via phone): It is not legal, Jesse. I've been a prosecutor as you know, my whole career and then Attorney General. This is an extreme abuse of power by this prosecutor, and this is a glimpse of what a Biden administration would look like.They want to take away our gun. That couple that you're showing on TV, they were defending their lives and they were defending their property, within Missouri under the Castle Doctrine, they had every right to do.These people weren't peaceful protesters. They crashed through their gated community. Armed -- armed -- came up. They told this couple, they were going to kill them. Kill them. They were even pointing out what bedroom they were going to live in, in this couple's home. They were going to kill the couple's dog.Look at them on this footage. It is outrageous.WATTERS: Yes.BONDI: These are good American citizens, Jesse. Look what they did. I'm proud of them.WATTERS: Yes, I mean, you're right about the law. There's the Castle Doctrine where you can defend your home. They have open carry in that neighborhood.BONDI: That's right.WATTERS: They have stand your ground there.

They have the right of the Second Amendment to have these weapons to protect their property and to protect their life.What it looks like to me is this ridiculous District Attorney whose conviction rates just dropping like a rock. She is not getting anything done. She's actually just let looters and rioters off the hook, no charges at all.There she is right there. Her name is Kimberly Gardner. She's funded by George Soros. This just looks like a political play to me to win votes. But I wish I knew more about this. It's just clearly unconstitutional. I'm outraged by it.I mean, this is the United States of America, you have the right to bear arms.BONDI: Jesse, every American should be outraged by this, every single American. This is our most fundamental right and not only that, they are protecting themselves. These people are protecting themselves outside their own home on their own property.WATTERS: Right.BONDI: This isn't even close to being legal. He had no legal basis to go in and seize their firearm. What about the people who came in there armed? The couple said those people were armed. They are the ones who should be under investigation.Let me tell you, we dealt with a Soros funded attorney, a District Attorney or state attorney in Florida in Orlando, and he is now no longer running for office. He wasn't prosecuting cases the way he should have. But that's what happening. George Soros around this country is funding these political prosecutors.WATTERS: Yes. They are putting everyone in danger, and they're just shredding the Bill of Rights. I mean, this is the country was founded upon, some of these rights. And the government can't do that.

The current world population is around . The study runs counter to the U.N.'s  that the world's population will reach its peak at nearly\u00a011 billion around\u00a02100.The study published in the Lancet projects U.S. population growth until just after mid-century, reaching a peak of 364 million in 2062. The current U.S. population is just under 330 million, according to the .\u201cThe USA's total fertility rate--which represents the average number of children a woman delivers over her lifetime--is predicted to steadily decline from 1.8 in 2017 to 1.5 in 2100; well below the minimum birth rate (2.1) considered necessary to maintain existing population levels long-term without immigration,\u201d the Lancet explains, in a .Other countries will also experience falling rates, with Italy and Spain seeing total fertility rates of 1.2 and Poland seeing a rate of 1.17. \u201cMuch of the anticipated fertility decline is predicted in high-fertility countries, particularly those in sub-Saharan Africa where rates are expected to fall below the replacement level for the first time--from an average 4.6 births per woman in 2017 to just 1.7 by 2100,\u201d the Lancet explains, in the press release.The research harnesses data from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2017. Using methods for forecasting mortality, fertility, and migration, researchers estimate that, by 2100, 183 of 195 countries will have total fertility rates below 2.1 births per woman. \u201cThis means that in these countries populations will decline unless low fertility is compensated by immigration,\u201d the Lancet press release says.In more than 23 countries and territories, the population will more than halve by the end of the century, according to the study. Japan\u2019s population, for example, is expected to fall from around 128 million people in 2017 to 60 million in 2100.The world\u2019s most populous nation will also see a marked population decline. China\u2019s population is predicted to fall from 1.4 billion in 2017 to 732 million at the end of the century.Set against this backdrop, India is predicted to have the world\u2019s largest population in 2100, with 1.09 billion people, albeit it down from 1.38 billion people in 2017. Nigeria will be the second most populous nation, with 791 million, up from 206 million in 2017. China and the U.S. will have the third and fourth largest populations, respectively.The study also predicts a global shift towards an aging population. An estimated 2.37 billion\u00a0individuals will be over 65 years of age globally in 2100, compared to 1.7 billion people under 20 years of age. The Lancet press release says that this underscores \"the need for liberal immigration policies in countries with significantly declining working age populations.\"\"Continued global population growth through the century is no longer the most likely trajectory for the world's population\", said Dr. Christopher Murray, director of Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington's School of Medicine, who led the research, in the press release. \"This study provides governments of all countries an opportunity to start rethinking their policies on migration, workforces and economic development to address the challenges presented by demographic change.\"Follow James Rogers on Twitter\u00a0", "comment": "(73)", "topic": "SCIENCE", "date": " July 20"}, {"cover": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/07/156/88/AP20200466847492.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "title": "Fauci: Trump restrictions on travel from China, Europe, UK saved American lives early in pandemic", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/politics/fauci-trump-travel-restrictions-saved-lives-coronavirus", "subtitle": "Dr. Anthony Fauci\u00a0told House lawmakers\u00a0Friday that he believed\u00a0President Trump's actions during the early stages of the coronavirus\u00a0pandemic saved American lives.", "keyword": "China and the world order", "website": "Fox News", "author": "Sam Dorman", "content": "\u00a0told House lawmakers\u00a0Friday that he believed\u00a0's actions during the early stages of the \u00a0pandemic saved American lives.During Fauci's testimony before the House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis, House Minority Whip Steve Scalise, R-La., asked Fauci if he\u00a0was involved in the president's January order restricting travel from China.\"Yes, sir, I was,\" Fauci answered.\"Do you agree with that decision?\" asked Scalise.\"I do,\" Fauci responded.\"Do you think that decision saved lives, Dr. Fauci?\" Scalise asked.\"Yes, I do,\" the head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases answered.Fauci went on to say\u00a0that he was \"actively involved\" in the administration's decision to restrict air travel to the U.S. from Europe, and repeated, \"Yes, I do\" when Scalise asked if he agreed with the move and if he believed it saved American lives.

So, I'm confident, we've had private\u00a0conversations as well, we will proceed in a\u00a0way that makes clear, it's not\u00a0OK to use your diplomats to engage\u00a0in industrial espionage, it's\u00a0not OK to steal intellectual property [or] engage in\u00a0those\u00a0kinds of behaviors.\u00a0That's the reason we did it: We\u00a0did it to protect the American\u00a0people.\"The host added that China reportedly threatened retaliation in the form of potentially closing U.S. outposts in Chengdu and/or Wuhan, pressing Pompeo as to whether that might come to pass.\"Let's go back to first\u00a0principles: ... for\u00a040 plus years --\u00a0this is why I am\u00a0at the Nixon Library today --\u00a0America has turned\u00a0the other cheek while we watched\u00a0the Chinese Communist Party\u00a0engage in activity that's not\u00a0fair to the American people,\u00a0it's not reciprocal for the\u00a0American people, and it doesn't\u00a0have the transparency we need so\u00a0we can engage with China in a\u00a0way that's fair for our people\u00a0and provide security for our\u00a0people, that's what we are\u00a0aiming to do,\" Pompeo responded. \"This decision about the [Houston] consulate is consistent with a\u00a0whole bunch of other actions\u00a0that we've taken and a whole\u00a0bunch more that we are going to\u00a0continue to do until we get the\u00a0change.\"MacCallum later considered whether the actions involving the Houston consulate, combined with other actions on both sides of the Pacific have brought upon that same atmosphere that Washington once had in its relationship with the Kremlin.\"We talk about\u00a0sanctions that we have, there\u00a0are military exercises that have\u00a0become somewhat more prominent in the\u00a0region,  that\u00a0just received indictments, are\u00a0we in a Cold War right now with\u00a0China?\" she asked. \"If we are not, it certainly\u00a0looks like we are.\"Pompeo said that China continues to leave a trail of broken promises involving things \"central to how great power-nations behave.\"He said that Chinese President Xi Jinping promised the Obama administration he would not militarize the South China Sea, and also that the Chinese had made a pact with Great Britain in 1999 involving the 50-year relative autonomy of Hong Kong.\"He busted it -- he broke it.\u00a0The United States is simply demanding that if the Chinese Communist Party wants to be\u00a0considered in the league of\u00a0nations that have great\u00a0power and great roles and great\u00a0importance, they have to behave\u00a0according to promises that they\u00a0make -- and the rules that have been\u00a0set out for sovereign nations to\u00a0preserve freedom for their own\u00a0people, that's what we are\u00a0seeking to see happen,\" Pompeo said.\"Label it what you must but\u00a0President Trump understands that previous administrations -- both\u00a0Republican and Democrat alike -- to turn\u00a0the other cheek for an awfully\u00a0long time and it resulted in a\u00a0real imbalance in the\u00a0relationship between the\u00a0United States and China -- and we aim\u00a0to fix it.\".", "comment": "", "topic": "Fox News Flash", "date": " July 23"}, {"cover": "https://a57.foxnews.com/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/694940094001/a9ddeb62-d229-40f8-b21c-db5636ac0607/cbc6dfac-91d5-4034-81e3-20d09fc2b116/1280x720/match/156/88/image.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "title": "Gordon Chang: US-China relations \u2014\u00a04 reasons\u00a0to scale back diplomatic facilities in both countries", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/china-diplomatic-facilities-gordon-chang", "subtitle": "Unfortunately, it is not possible to co-exist with a regime that President Nixon worried would become a \u201cFrankenstein.\u201d", "keyword": "China and the world order", "website": "Fox News", "author": "", "content": "Critics of President Donald  foreign policy are appalled that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, in his landmark address Thursday, effectively announced the end of America\u2019s half-century \u201cengagement\u201d of China\u2019s Communist Party and instead promised Washington would \u201cengage and empower the Chinese people\u201d with \u201cin-person diplomacy.\u201d\u201cCombined with other recent speeches by Trump  and a number of actions by Trump himself, it amounts to a cry for war,\u201d writes Fred Kaplan in his War Stories column on the Slate site. \u201cBut it is a senseless cry\u2014implausible, infeasible, and heedless of the damage that further escalation will inflict on our own country and its allies.\u201dKaplan and others, however, are wrong. There is nothing to suggest  wants war, and he was absolutely right to abandon a spectacularly unsuccessful approach to China.Moreover, \u201cfurther escalation\u201d of tensions works in America\u2019s favor if it means Washington ultimately reduces the scope of ties with Beijing.For decades, the U.S. worked overtime to cooperate with and support the Communist Party, but Washington only emboldened its worst elements. Moreover, by failing to back up warnings and protect its interests, Washington legitimized those elements by showing everybody else in Beijing that provocation, belligerence\u00a0and aggression in fact worked.For instance, within months after the Obama administration failed to defend Scarborough Shoal from Chinese encroachment\u00a0\u2014\u00a0the White House hoped to avoid further confrontation \u2014 Beijing ramped up pressure on other South China Sea features belonging to the Philippines, began to build artificial islands in the Spratly archipelago, and turned up the heat in the East China Sea over the Japan-administered Senkaku islets.America\u2019s disastrous track record was not lost on Xi Jinping. The hardline Chinese ruler is now fast pushing China back to Mao-like politics and economics, is relentlessly attempting to dismember neighboring states, is stealing hundreds of billions of dollars a year of intellectual property, is trying to subvert other societies, and is implementing minority policies constituting crimes against humanity. In addition, beginning late last year he took steps that inevitably led to the  and is still impeding efforts to control the disease.Those who seek to work with China \u2014 the line we hear is that the world needs Beijing\u2019s cooperation to solve global problems \u2014 downplay the destructive nature of Xi\u2019s actions. Unfortunately, it is not possible to co-exist with a regime that President Nixon worried would become a \u201cFrankenstein.\u201dCommunist China is not, as analysts tell us, merely engaged in one of history\u2019s many boys-will-be-boys contests for dominance. It seeks to overthrow the current international order, established by the Treaty of Westphalia of 1648, and put in its place a system of worldwide Chinese rule.Moreover, there is not much hope that relations will improve with a China\u00a0dominated by Xi. The party-state he leads is not capable of reform.In these circumstances, Mr. Xi is leaving the rest of the world with little choice. By far, the best policy for protecting America \u2014 perhaps the only realistic course of action \u2014 seeks the reduction of ties to reduce vulnerability to Chinese predation.The Trump administration\u2019s closing of China\u2019s Houston consulate, a , was an important step.In retaliation, Beijing ordered the closure of the American consulate in the western city of Chengdu. Analysts say consulate closings generally work to Washington\u2019s disadvantage. The theory is that China is a relatively closed society so America has greater need for diplomatic outposts in China than China has need for them in the U.S. There is, of course, logic to that argument.Nonetheless, there are reasons for the U.S. to seek a dramatic scaling back of diplomatic facilities in both countries. First, China in recent years had become unusually bold in its use of its five \u2014now four \u2014 consulates in America and its embassy for grossly inappropriate activities.\u00a0 Beijing, for instance, has become aggressive in its use of consulates for spying, as was made clear in a briefing conducted Friday by unnamed State and Justice Department officials along with a \u201csenior U.S. intelligence official.\u201d Even China\u2019s ambassador to the U.S., Cui Tiankai, was caught, along with a diplomat from the New York consulate, in trying to surreptitiously recruit genetics researchers.Moreover, Beijing has used its consulates for Operation Fox Hunt, an effort to coerce the return to China of Chinese who have fled, and the strict monitoring and inappropriate mobilization of Chinese students. Both activities violate U.S. sovereignty.Second, Washington must do a better job protecting American diplomatic personnel in China and the best way to do that is get them off Chinese soil. Beginning spring 2018, mysterious sonic attacks caused brain injuries to American diplomats stationed in the Guangzhou consulate. Beijing denied responsibility, but in China\u2019s near-total surveillance state no one could launch such attacks without the authorities knowing about them.Beijing has been engaged in taking hostages of foreigners recently \u2014 most notably, Canada\u2019s \u201cTwo Michaels\u201d and a number of unsuspecting Americans caught by exit bans \u2014 and it is not inconceivable that arrogant Chinese leaders will go after American diplomats as well.Third, U.S. consulates support American companies, and they should not be in China in the first place. These businesses, for example, provide revenue to a regime that uses the cash for malign purposes, many of them directed against the U.S. Why should Americans finance China\u2019s malicious campaign against America?Fourth, the more American policymakers pursued China, the worse China\u2019s behavior became, so cutting links might actually encourage Beijing to act more responsibly. As in any relationship \u2014business, personal, diplomatic \u2014\u00a0the party with less interest in maintenance of it has the greater bargaining power.It is true, as is endless repeated, that the Sino-U.S. bilateral relationship is the most important one in the world, but America needs far less contact with China.

In March, she tweeted about Cuba\u2019s response:\"#Cuba is known globally for its willingness to send health professional teams to the most challenging emergencies. Full marks to it for sending personnel to #Covid_19 - stricken #Italy\u201dFor that, she attracted the ire of U.N.\u00a0Watch, a Geneva-based watchdog: \u201cHelen Clark has an attraction to Communist dictatorships. Here she is showering praise on Cuba's Communist regime for sending doctors abroad.\u201dIt\u2019s also accused her of being \u00a0as well as WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. But in remarks in May, Clark was critical of the\u00a0Chinese response and said it took seven days after Chinese officials determined the virus was a \u201chuge threat\u201d to warn their\u00a0people.\u201cIn that seven days, millions began traveling for the Lunar New Year and in Wuhan...there were thousands of people at mass events, so this is pretty disturbing,\" she said on .\u201cIf you want to be a great power that is respected, and fear doesn\u2019t bring respect, then you have to be upfront\u00a0as utterly transparent with the international community,\" she said.She also expressed concern about countries allowing Huawei access to their systems, saying it appeared to be approved on cost, rather than for security reasons. But she also stood by her decision as prime minister to make New Zealand the first country to sign a free trade deal with China.\u201cTo those who criticize efforts to bring China into the international\u00a0rules-based trading order, I would ask, well what\u2019s the alternative?\" she asked. \"To have them operating out there outside the multilateral rules framework? That\u2019s really unthinkable.\u201d that it would withdraw\u00a0from the World Health Organization over the WHO's\u00a0handling of the coronavirus pandemic. President Trump has\u00a0cited WHO officials' praise of Chinese \"transparency,\" its dismissal of warnings about the virus from Taiwan, and its repetition of Chinese claims that COVID-19 could not be spread from person-to-person. Trump has also pointed to opposition from WHO officials to his decision to place a travel ban on China in the initial days of the crisis.\"Chinese officials ignored their reporting obligations to the World Health Organization and pressured the World Health Organization to mislead the world when the virus was first discovered by Chinese authorities,\" he said, announcing the move. \"Countless lives have been taken and profound economic hardship has been inflicted across the globe.\"On Wednesday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo indicated that he was not hopeful for the upcoming investigation, particularly given the Chinese government's lack of transparency in the past.\u201cThis is a regime that failed to disclose information they had about a virus that\u2019s now killed over 100,000 Americans, hundreds of thousands across the world, cost the global economy trillions and trillions of dollars, and now is allowing the World Health Organization to go in to conduct what I am confident will be a completely, completely whitewashed investigation,\u201d he said.", "comment": "", "topic": "World Health Organization", "date": " July 16"}, {"cover": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/07/156/88/ChinaFlooding_1.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "title": "China flooding death toll rises as surging waters trigger new alerts, dam blasted", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/world/china-flooding-chube-river-dam-blasted-water-level-huai-river-disaster-weather", "subtitle": "Days of torrential rainfall and expectations for further flooding led China to raise its flood alert level on one river\u00a0to the second-highest level on Sunday as a dam was blasted to release surging waters.", "keyword": "China and the world order", "website": "Fox News", "author": "Travis Fedschun", "content": "Days of  and expectations for further  led  to raise its flood  on one river\u00a0to the second-highest level on Sunday as a dam was blasted to release .The  of China\u2019s Ministry of Water Resources said the Huai River's ten reservoirs have seen water levels exceeding flood levels by as much as 22 feet, prompting the rise in alert level.While the  is now under a Level 3 alert, areas along the Yangtze River have declared the highest flood alerts.\u201cFloods are occurring at the same time at the Yangtze River, Huai River\u00a0and Tai Lake ...The flood prevention situation is very severe,\u201d the water resources ministry .In central China, state broadcaster CCTV reported the dam on the Chuhe River in Anhui province was destroyed with explosives early Sunday morning in order to release the floodwaters behind it.After the blast, the water level was expected to drop by more than 2 feet.Blasting dams and embankments to discharge water was an extreme response employed during China\u2019s worst floods in recent years, including in 1998 when more than 2,000 people died and almost 3 million homes were destroyed.Water levels on many rivers, including the mighty Yangtze, have been unusually high this year because of torrential rains.Last week,  on the Yangtze opened three floodgates as the water level behind the massive dam rose more than 50 feet above flood level.Another flood crest is expected to arrive at the dam on Tuesday.Since last month, at least 141 people have died and\u00a0\u00a0in the Yangtze River region, affecting\u00a0virtually all of mainland\u00a0.The summer rainy season in China brings floods across the country every year, particularly in the central and southern\u00a0regions.

Earlier in the week, the State Department announced that China's consulate in Houston would be closed, with Pompeo saying the complex was \"a hub of spying and IP theft.\" China has .Against that fraught backdrop, Pompeo\u00a0promised action that he distinguished from Cold War-era \"containment,\" which aimed to stop the spread of communism and keep the Soviet Union isolated.\"It\u2019s true that unlike the Soviet Union, China is deeply integrated into the global economy,\" he said. \"But Beijing is more dependent on us than we are on them.\"Hours after the FBI alleged a coordinated scheme by China to \"send military scientists to the United States on false pretenses with false covers or false statements about their true employment,\" Pompeo emphasized that the immigration system was prone to abuse.\"We opened our arms to Chinese citizens, only to see the CCP exploit our free and open society,\" Pompeo continued, in perhaps his most pointed remarks directed at the Chinese government. \"General Secretary Xi Jinping is a true believer in a bankrupt totalitarian ideology.\"Throughout his address, which also warned of the encroaching national security threats of major Chinese technology companies, Pompeo took pains to distinguish the CCP from the Chinese people.\"Communists always lie, but the biggest lie is that the Chinese Communist Party speaks for 1.4 billion people who are surveilled, oppressed, and scared to speak out,\" Pompeo remarked.\u00a0\"Quite the contrary. The CCP fears the Chinese people\u2019s honest opinions more than any foreign foe.

President Reagan dealt with the Soviets on the basis of 'trust but verify.' When it comes to the CCP, I say, 'Distrust and verify.'\"Previous Trump administration measures against Chinese officials, students and researchers have included travel bans, registration requirements and other steps intended to reduce the country's footprint in the United States. The administration also has announced its outright rejection of virtually all Chinese maritime claims in the South China Sea.These actions have come as Trump has sought to blame China for the coronavirus outbreak in the U.S., where cases have soared. Trump himself said more closures could be coming if China didn't change its behavior. \"It's always possible,\" he told reporters at the White House.Pompeo similarly hit that theme. \"Just think how much better off the world would\u2019ve been if the doctors in Wuhan had been allowed to raise the alarm about the outbreak of a new coronavirus,\" he said.The State Department announced it ordered the consulate closed within 72 hours after alleging that Chinese agents have tried to steal data from facilities in Texas, including the Texas A&M medical system statewide and The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston.There were indications consulate staff were preparing to leave: Papers were being burned on the consulate grounds late Tuesday night \u2014 a common practice when a diplomatic post is being shuttered on short notice.Cai Wei, the Chinese consul general, told KTRK-TV in Houston the order to shut down was \"quite wrong\" and \"very damaging\" to U.S.-China relations.Asked about accusations of espionage and stealing data, Cai said, \"You have to give some evidence, say something from the facts. ...

Thank you and welcome back to \"FOX NEWS SUNDAY.\"DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:\u00a0 Thank you very much.WALLACE:\u00a0 Let's start with the surge of the coronavirus across the country in recent months. You still talk about it as, quote, \"burning embers.\" But I want to put up a chart that shows where we are with the illness over the last four months. As you can see, we hit a peak here in April, 36,000 cases...TRUMP:\u00a0 Cases.WALLACE:\u00a0 ... a day.TRUMP:\u00a0 Yes, cases.WALLACE:\u00a0 Then -- then it went down and now since June, it has gone up more than double. One day this week 75,000 new cases.\u00a0 More than double...TRUMP:\u00a0 Chris, that's because we have great testing, because we have the best testing in the world. If we didn't test, you wouldn't be able to show that chart. If we tested half as much, those numbers would be down.WALLACE:\u00a0 But -- but this isn't burning embers, sir? This is a forest fire.TRUMP:\u00a0 No, no. But I don't say -- I say flames, we'll put out the flames. And we'll put out in some cases just burning embers. We also have burning embers. We have embers and we do have flames. Florida became more flame like, but it's -- it's going to be under control.And, you know, it's not just this country, it\u2019s many countries. We don't talk about it in the news. They don't talk about Mexico and Brazil and still parts of Europe, which actually got hit sooner than us, so it's a little ahead of us in that sense.But you take a look, why don't they talk about Mexico?\u00a0 Which is not helping us. And all I can say is thank God I built most of the wall, because if I didn't have the wall up we would have a much bigger problem with Mexico.WALLACE:\u00a0 But, sir, we have the seventh highest mortality rate in the world. Our mortality rate is higher than Brazil, it's higher than Russia and the European Union has us on a travel ban.TRUMP:\u00a0 Yeah. I think what we'll do -- well, we have them under travel ban too, Chris. I closed them off. If you remember, I was the one that did the European Union very early. But when you talk about mortality rates, I think it's the opposite. I think we have one of the lowest mortality rates in the world.WALLACE:\u00a0 That\u2019s not true, sir. We, we, we have a -- we had 900 deaths on a single day...TRUMP:\u00a0 We will take a look...WALLACE:\u00a0 ... just this week...TRUMP:\u00a0 Ready?WALLACE:\u00a0 You, you can check it out.TRUMP:\u00a0 Can you please get me the mortality rate?TRUMP:\u00a0 Kayleigh's right here. I heard we have one of the lowest, maybe the lowest mortality rate anywhere in the world. TRUMP: Do you have the numbers, please? Because I heard we had the best mortality rate. TRUMP: Number, number one low mortality rate. TRUMP: I hope you show the scenario because it shows what fake news is all about. Ok, go ahead.WALLACE: OK, OK. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m fake news but I will -- we\u2019ll put --TRUMP: Yeah, you will --WALLACE: -- put our stats on --TRUMP: You said we had the worst mortality rate in the world --WALLACE: I said you had --TRUMP: -- and we have the best.WALLACE VOICE OVER: All right. It\u2019s a little complicated. But bear with us.\u00a0 We went with numbers from Johns Hopkins University which charted the mortality rate for 20 countries hit by the virus. The US ranked 7th better than the United Kingdom but worse than Brazil and Russia. WALLACE VOICE OVER: The White House went with this chart from the European CDC which shows Italy and Spain doing worse. But countries like Brazil and South Korea doing better. Other countries doing better like Russia aren\u2019t included in the White House chart.WALLACE: California locking down again. Florida, deadliest day of the entire pandemic. Hospitals at capacity at a number of places around the country. Shortages of testing, shortages of personal protective equipment for nurses and doctors.A lot of people say this is because we don't have a national plan. You talk about states. We don't have a national plan. Do you take responsibility for that?TRUMP:\u00a0 Look, I take responsibility always for everything because it's ultimately my job, too. I have to get everybody in line.Some governors have done well, some governors have done poorly. They're supposed to have supplies they didn't have. I supplied everybody.Now we have somewhat of a surge in certain areas. And other areas we're doing great. But we have a surge in certain areas. But you don't hear people complaining about ventilators. We've got all the ventilators we can use. We're supplying them to other countries. We go out into parking lots and everything, everybody gets a test. We find -- if we did half the testing -- with all of that being said, I'm glad we did it. This is the right way to do it. I'm glad we did what we're doing. But we have more tests by far than any country in the world.WALLACE:\u00a0 But, sir, testing is up 37 percent.TRUMP:\u00a0 Well, that's good.WALLACE:\u00a0 I understand. Cases are up 194 percent. It isn't just that testing has gone up, it's that the virus has spread. The positivity rate has increased. There \u2013 the virus is\u2026TRUMP:\u00a0 Many of those cases...WALLACE:\u00a0 ... worse than it was.TRUMP:\u00a0 Many of those cases are young people that would heal in a day. They have the sniffles and we put it down as a test. Many of them -- don't forget, I guess it's like 99.7 percent, people are going to get better and in many cases they're going to get better very quickly.We go out and we look and then on the news -- look if you go back to the news, all of your -- even your wonderful competitors, you'll see cases are up. Cases are up -- many of those cases shouldn't even be cases. Cases are up because we have the best testing in the world and we have the most testing.No country has ever done what we've done in terms of testing. We are the envy of the world. They call and they say the most incredible job anybody's done is our job on testing, because we're going to very shortly be up to 50 million tests.You look at other countries; they don't even do tests. They do tests if somebody walks into the hospital, they're sick, they're really sick, they test them then, or they'll test them in a doctor's office. But they don't go around have massive areas of testing and we do. And I'm glad we do, but it really skews the numbers.WALLACE:\u00a0I\u2019m, I'm going to do you a favor, because I'm sure a lot of people listening right now are going to say, \"Trump, he tries to play it down, he tries to make it not being as serious as it is.\"TRUMP:\u00a0 I don't play it -- I'm not playing -- no, this is very serious.WALLACE:\u00a0 75,000 cases a day.TRUMP:\u00a0 Show me the death chart.WALLACE:\u00a0 Well, I don't have the death chart.TRUMP:\u00a0 Well, the death chart is much more important.WALLACE:\u00a0 But I can tell you, the death chart is a thousand cases a day.TRUMP:\u00a0 Excuse me, it's all too much, it shouldn't be one case. It came from China. They should've never let it escape. They should've never let it out. But it is what it is. Take a look at Europe, take a look at the numbers in Europe. And by the way, they're having cases.WALLACE:\u00a0I can tell you cases are 6,000 in the whole European Union.TRUMP:\u00a0 They don't test. They don't test.WALLACE:\u00a0 Is it possible that they don't have the virus as badly as we do?TRUMP:\u00a0 It's possible that they don't test, that's what's possible. We find cases and many of those cases heal automatically. We're finding -- in a way, we're creating trouble. Certainly, we are creating trouble for the fake news to come along and say, \"Oh, we have more cases.\"Look, we do something that nobody's ever done. Not only the ventilators, where we're supplying them all over the world. We did a testing program the likes of which nobody's ever done before.WALLACE: The head of the CDC, Dr. Redfield, said this on Tuesday. WALLACE: Do you agree with Dr. Redfield?TRUMP:\u00a0 I don't know and I don't think he knows. I don't think anybody knows with this. This is a very tricky deal. Everybody thought this summer it would go away and it would come back in the fall. Well, when the summer came, they used to say the heat -- the heat was good for it and it really knocks it out, remember? And then it might come back in the fall. So they got that one wrong.They -- they got a lot wrong. They got a lot wrong. The World Health got a tremendous amount wrong. They basically did whatever China wanted them to. And we'll save now almost $500 million a year, which is nice. But the World Health got a lot wrong.WALLACE:\u00a0But, this is one of the sharpest criticisms of you.TRUMP: I agree.WALLACE: People say that you talk about the world as you\u2019d like to see it rather than follow the science.TRUMP: No, I\u2026 WALLACE:\u00a0Well \u2013 let me just, let me just ask the question, sir. Why on earth would your administration be involved in a campaign at this point to discredit Dr. Fauci, who is the nation's top infectious disease expert.TRUMP:\u00a0 Because we're not. If one man from my administration doesn't like him because he made a few mistakes -- look, Dr. Fauci said, \"Don't wear a mask.\" Dr. Fauci told me not to ban China, it would be a big mistake. I did it over and above his recommendation. Dr. Fauci then said, \"You saved tens of thousands of lives\" -- more than that. He said, \"You saved tens of thousands of lives.\"Dr. Fauci's made some mistakes. But I have a very good -- I spoke to him yesterday at length. I have a very good relationship with Dr. Fauci.WALLACE:\u00a0 But -- but, sir, this week -- this weekend, your White House put out a series of statements, so-called mistakes that Dr. Fauci had made. One of your closest aids -- one of your right-hand men, Daniel Scavino, put out this -- you've seen this? TRUMP: Well Dr., look, look\u2026WALLACE: Dr. \u2013 Dr. \u2013 \u2018Dr. Faucet,\u2019 which shows him as a leaker and an alarmist. TRUMP:\u00a0 Well, I don't know that he\u2019s a leaker \u2026. WALLACE: Why, why would you do that?TRUMP: He's a little bit of an alarmist. That's OK. A little bit of an alarmist.WALLACE:\u00a0 He's a bit of an alarmist?TRUMP:\u00a0 A little bit of an alarmist. Let\u2019s \u2013 let me just say. Dr. Fauci at the beginning \u2013 and again, I have a great relationship with him. I spoke with him at length yesterday. Dr. Fauci at the beginning said, \u201cThis will pass. Don\u2019t worry about it. This will pass.\u201d He was wrong. Dr. Fauci said, \u201cDon\u2019t ban China. Don\u2019t ban China.\u201d I did. He then admitted that I was right.WALLACE:\u00a0 But you made mistakes, too.TRUMP:\u00a0 I guess everybody makes mistakes.WALLACE:\u00a0I was going to say, you said at one point\u2026 TRUMP: I'll be right eventually. I will be right eventually. You know I said, \"It's going to disappear.\" I'll say it again.WALLACE: But does that \u2013 does that discredit you? TRUMP: It's going to disappear and I'll be right. I don\u2019t think so.WALLACE:\u00a0Right.TRUMP:\u00a0 I don't think so. I don't think so. You know why? Because I've been right probably more than anybody else.WALLACE: Then there are masks. From the first day that the CDC said that people should wear masks on April 3rd, you said you weren\u2019t going to. You wore a mask for the first time in public\u2026TRUMP: Yes.WALLACE: \u2026at Walter Reed this weekend. Question, the CDC says if everybody wore a mask for 4-6 weeks, we could get this under control. Do you regret not wearing a mask in public from the start, and would you consider \u2013 will you consider a national mandate that people need to wear masks?TRUMP: No I want people to have a certain freedom, and I don\u2019t believe in that. No, and I don\u2019t agree with the statement that if everybody wear a mask everything disappears. Hey, Dr. Fauci said don\u2019t wear a mask. Our Surgeon General \u2013 terrific guy \u2013 said don\u2019t wear a mask.Everybody who is saying don\u2019t wear a mask \u2013 all of sudden everybody\u2019s got to wear a mask, and as you know masks cause problems, too. With that being said, I\u2019m a believer in masks. I think masks are good.But I leave it up to the governors. Many of the governors are changing. They\u2019re more mask into \u2013 they like the concept of masks, but some of them don\u2019t agree. I do say this \u2013 schools have to open.Young people have to go to school, and there\u2019s problems when you don\u2019t go to school, too. And there\u2019s going to be a funding problem because we\u2019re not going to fund \u2013 when they don\u2019t open their schools. We\u2019re not going to fund them. We\u2019re not going to give them money if they\u2019re not going to school. If they don\u2019t open.WALLACE: Two points on that. First of all, what the Federal government gives is only \u2013 is 8 percent.TRUMP: Ten percent and you know what \u2013 that\u2019s a lot of money.WALLACE: And you\u2019re going to take \u2013 do you know where the money goes? It goes overwhelmingly to disadvantaged kids and children with disabilities.TRUMP: Let the schools \u2013WALLACE: Why wouldn\u2019t you put -- send more money so the schools would be safer?TRUMP: Chris, let the schools open. Do you ever see the statistics on young people below the age of 18? The state of New Jersey had thousands of deaths.Of all of these thousands, one person below the age of 18 \u2013 in the entire state \u2013 one person and that was a person that had, I believe he said diabetes.One person below the age of 18 died in the state of New Jersey during all of this \u2013 you know, they had a hard time. And they\u2019re doing very well now, so that\u2019s it.WALLACE: The stimulus bill is running out at the end of this month.TRUMP: Yes.WALLACE: The Republicans say they want liability limits, which the Democrats don\u2019t like. You say that you want a payroll tax cut, which even some Republicans are cool to.TRUMP: But a lot of Republicans like it, though.WALLACE: Will you only sign a bill that has those two provisions?TRUMP: Well, we\u2019re going to see. But we do need protections because businesses are going to get sued just because somebody walked in. You don\u2019t know where this virus comes from. They\u2019ll sit down at a restaurant. They\u2019ll sue the restaurant, the guy\u2019s out of business.WALLACE: Right.TRUMP: So we do need some kind of immunity.\u00a0 You do need it just like you need immunity for the police, OK, whether they like it or not. You need immunity for the police. But they do need a form of immunity. You don\u2019t know if they caught it. And nobody\u2019s ever going to be able to prove it one way or the other.You can\u2019t put these \u2013 you know, the people that \u2013 look, the Democrats don\u2019t want to do that because they\u2019re total \u2013 they\u2019re totally captured by the lobby of lawyers. The lawyers\u2019 lobby is probably the most powerful in the country.WALLACE: What about the payroll tax cut?TRUMP: I want to see it. I want to see it.WALLACE: And if it isn\u2019t in the bill?TRUMP: I\u2019ll have to see but, yeah, I would consider not signing it if we don\u2019t have a payroll tax cut, yes.WALLACE: Hot enough for you here, Mr. President?TRUMP: It\u2019s hot. It\u2019s about, well, sort of almost record breaking stuff.WALLACE: You know, we wanted to do it inside. This is your choice.TRUMP: But I wanted you to sweat a little bit.(LAUGHTER)WALLACE: Well, we both are. There has been a spike in violent crime in America in recent weeks. We\u2019ve seen deaths up in New York, deaths up in Chicago, shootings. How do you explain it and what are you going to do about it?TRUMP: I explain it very simply by saying that they\u2019re Democrat-run cities, they are liberally run. They are stupidly run. We have forced them in Seattle to end the CHOP because, you know, we were going in that following day. You probably have heard it. We were getting ready to go in. We were all set, and when they heard that we were going they set their police force.WALLACE: Liberal Democrats have been running cities in this country for decades.TRUMP: Poorly.WALLACE: Why is it so bad right now?TRUMP: They run them poorly, it was always bad but now it\u2019s gotten totally out of control and it\u2019s really because they want to defund the police. And Biden wants to defund the police.WALLACE: No he, sir, he does not.TRUMP: Look. He signed a charter with Bernie Sanders; I will get that one just like I was right on the mortality rate. Did you read the charter that he agreed to with\u2026WALLACE: It says nothing about defunding the police.TRUMP: Oh really? It says abolish, it says -- let\u2019s go. Get me the charter, please.WALLACE: All right.TRUMP: Chris, you\u2019ve got to start studying for these.WALLACE: He says defund the police?TRUMP: He says defund the police. They talk about abolishing the police. They talk about illegal aliens pouring \u2026WALLACE: I look, I look forward \u2013 I look forward to seeing that.WALLACE: Meanwhile, the George Floyd murder has reignited the issue of racism in policing in this country. I want to give you a couple of statistics. Nationwide blacks are twice as likely, fewer in absolute numbers, but in terms of per capita, blacks are twice as likely to be shot and killed by police as whites are. In Minneapolis, over the last five years, police used force against blacks at a rate seven times that against whites.Can you understand why blacks would be angry at that?TRUMP: Of course I do. Of course I do. Many whites are killed also. You have to say that.WALLACE: I understand that.TRUMP: I mean, many, many whites are killed. I hate the sad \u2013 but this is going on for decades. This is going on for a long time, long before I got here. You know, if you look at what\u2019s gone on in Portland, those are anarchists and we\u2019ve taken a very tough stand. If we didn\u2019t take a stand in Portland, you know we\u2019ve arrested many of these leaders. If we didn\u2019t take that stand, right now you would have a problem like you, you \u2013 they were going to lose Portland. So let\u2019s see\u2026WALLACE: Ok, let\u2019s see.TRUMP: \u2026what this says here: Prosecutions, sanctuary cities, incentivize illegal aliens, expand asylum, abolish immigration detention \u2013WALLACE: That\u2019s not \u2013TRUMP: No. I, I \u2013 we\u2019ll find it.WALLACE: Ok.TRUMP: This thing is many pages long.TRUMP: End prosecution of illegal border crossers. Support deathly -- and these are the worse things, sanctuary cities \u2013WALLACE: Sir, I\u2019m not, I\u2019m not, I\u2019m not disagreeing with you on any of those. I\u2019m disagreeing about defund police \u2013(WALLACE VOICE OVER: The White House never sent us evidence the Bernie-Biden platform calls for defunding or abolishing police\u2014because there is none.\u00a0 It calls for increased funding for police departments--that meet certain standards. Biden has called for redirecting some police funding for related programs\u2014like mental health counseling.)WALLACE: This week you said that Black Lives Matter and the Confederate flag are both matters, issues of freedom of speech.TRUMP: Yeah.WALLACE: But in the case of the Confederate flag, there are a lot of people who say these were traitors who split from this country, fought this country in large part to preserve slavery. Is the Confederate flag offensiveTRUMP: It depends on who you\u2019re talking about, when you\u2019re talking about.TRUMP: When people \u2013 when people proudly have their Confederate flags, they\u2019re not talking about racism. They love their flag, it represents the south, they like the south. People right now like the south. I\u2019d say it\u2019s freedom of, of, of many things, but it\u2019s freedom of speech.WALLACE: So you\u2019re not offended by it?TRUMP: Well, I\u2019m not offended either by Black Lives Matter. That\u2019s freedom of speech. And you know, the whole thing with cancel culture, we can\u2019t cancel our whole history. We can\u2019t forget that the north and the south fought. We have to remember that, otherwise we\u2019ll end up fighting again. You can\u2019t just cancel all...WALLACE: But let me ask you this when it gets to be more than just cancel \u2013 well, maybe this is cancel culture. The National Defense Authorization Act, the NDAA, you have threatened to veto it because in the bill, and this was supported by Republicans as well as Democrats, it would rename army bases named for Confederate generals. Now this is a bill that funds military operations, it gives soldiers a pay raise.TRUMP: Yeah.WALLACE: You\u2019re going to veto that?TRUMP: No, because they\u2019ll get their pay raise. Hey, look, don\u2019t tell me this. I got soldiers the biggest pay raises in the history of our military.WALLACE: Understood.TRUMP: I got soldiers brand new equipment, brand new jets, brand new rockets, brand new \u2013 $2.5 trillion. I did more for the military than any president that\u2019s ever had this office.WALLACE: But you\u2019re going to veto this bill?TRUMP: Because I think that Fort Bragg, Fort Robert E. Lee, all of these forts that have been named that way for a long time, decades and decades\u2026WALLACE: But the military says they\u2019re for this.TRUMP: \u2026excuse me, excuse me. I don\u2019t care what the military says. I do \u2013 I\u2019m supposed to make the decision. Fort Bragg is a big deal. We won two World Wars, nobody even knows General Bragg. We won two World Wars. Go to that community where Fort Bragg is, in a great state, I love that state, go to the community, say how do you like the idea of renaming Fort Bragg, and then what are we going to name itWe\u2019re going to name it after the Reverend Al Sharpton? What are you going to name it, Chris, tell me what you\u2019re going to name it? So there\u2019s a whole thing here. We won two World Wars, two World Wars, beautiful World Wars that were vicious and horrible, and we won them out of Fort Bragg, we won out of all of these forts that now they want to throw those names away.And, no, I\u2019m against that, and you know what, most other people are. And I even \u2013 I don\u2019t believe in polls because I see the fakest polls I\u2019ve ever seen, but that poll is a 64 percent thing, which actually surprised me. We won World Wars out of these military bases. No, I\u2019m not going to go changing them, I\u2019m not going to go changing them.WALLACE: So you\u2019ll veto them?TRUMP: I might. Yeah, I might.WALLACE: At Mt. Rushmore on July 3rd, you said that we face a far-left fascism in this country and then you said this.TAPE: July 3, 2020TRUMP: Our children are taught in school to hate their own country and to believe that the men and women who built it we\u2019re not heroes, but that were villains.WALLACE: You said our children are taught in school to hate our country. Where do you see that?TRUMP: I just look at \u2013 I look at school. I watch, I read, look at the stuff. Now they want to change -- 1492, Columbus discovered America. You know, we grew up, you grew up, we all did, that\u2019s what we learned. Now they want to make it the 1619 project. Where did that come from? What does it represent? I don\u2019t even know, so.WALLACE: It\u2019s slavery.TRUMP: That\u2019s what they\u2019re saying, but they don\u2019t even know. They just want to make a change. Cancel culture \u2013 I hate the term, actually, but I use itWALLACE: But are they teaching people to hate America?TRUMP: Oh, I think so yeah, I think so. Look at the professors. Look at what\u2019s going on in the colleges. If a conservative goes on a college \u2013 and look, we have as many as them. Excuse me, I think to the best of my knowledge, we\u2019re sitting at the White House and the Oval Office is right behind me. We have as many as them.WALLACE: Who\u2019s them?TRUMP: The liberal radical left, and I\u2019m not talking all \u2013 I think liberal, I could tell you I like a lot of liberal people. I like a lot of liberal governors and senators, but, but Chris, we have a radical left destructive ideology and it\u2019s being taught in our schools.And don\u2019t act like you\u2019re surprised to hear this \u2013 there are books written about it, and we can\u2019t let that go on. We can\u2019t let them change the true meaning of what we\u2019re all about and that\u2019s what they\u2019re trying to do and I don\u2019t want it to happen. Not on my watch. It\u2019s not going to happen on my watch.WALLACE:\u00a0 Mr. President, you'll be happy to know that Fox News has a new poll out today and you're going to be the very first person to hear about it. In the national horse race, Joe Biden leads you by 8 points, 49 percent to 41.\u00a0 That's 3, 4 points slimmer than it was a month ago. And on the issues, people trust Biden more to handle the coronavirus by 17 points, on race relations by 21 points, and even on the economy they trust Biden more by 1 point. I understand you still have more than a hundred days to this election, but at this point you're losing.TRUMP:\u00a0 First of all, I'm not losing, because those are fake polls. They were fake in 2016 and now they're even more fake. The polls were much worse in 2016. They interviewed 22 percent Republicans. Well, how do you do 22 percent Republican? You see what's going on. I have other polls that put me leading, and we have polls where I'm leading. I have a poll where we're leading in every swing state.\u00a0 And I don't believe that your -- first of all, the Fox polls, whoever does your Fox polls, they're among the worst. They got it all wrong in 2016. They've been wrong on every poll I've ever seen.WALLACE:\u00a0 I -- I must tell you...TRUMP:\u00a0 No, I'm just telling you. And let me ask you this, so on the economy -- so I've always led on the economy by a lot.WALLACE:\u00a0 I know, which is why I was surprised by this number.TRUMP:\u00a0 Biden can't put two sentences together. They wheel him out. He goes up -- he repeats -- they ask him questions. He reads a teleprompter and then he goes back into his basement. You tell me the American people want to have that in an age where we're in trouble with other nations that are looking to do numbers on us.WALLACE:\u00a0 So let me ask you a direct question.TRUMP:\u00a0 No, no...WALLACE:\u00a0 No, I'm going to ask you a direct question about Joe Biden. Is Joe Biden senile?TRUMP:\u00a0 I don't want to say that. I'd say he's not competent to be president. To be president, you have to be sharp and tough and so many other things. He doesn't even come out of his basement. They think, \"Oh this is a great campaign.\" So he goes in, I'll then make a speech, it'll be a great speech, and some young guy, starts writing, \"Vice President Biden said this, this, this, this.\" He didn't say it. Joe doesn't know he's alive, OK? He doesn't know he's alive. Do the American people want that, number one. Number two, I built the greatest economy ever built anywhere in the world; not only of this country, anywhere in the world.\u00a0 Until we got hit with the China virus. We got hit with the virus, shouldn't have happened, and we had to close up, we saved millions of lives. Now we've opened it up, got to go back to school. We're open. We've got to do things. We had the best job numbers we've ever had last month. We should have good ones coming up in two weeks. Look, I built the greatest economy in history, I'm now doing it again. You see the numbers; the numbers are through the roof. The Democrats are purposely keeping their schools closed, keeping their states closed. I called Michigan, I want to have a big rally in Michigan. Do you know we're not allowed to have a rally in Michigan? Do you know we're not allowed to have a rally in Minnesota? Do you know we're not allowed to have a rally in Nevada? We're not allowed to have rallies.WALLACE: Well, some people would say it\u2019s a health...TRUMP:\u00a0 In these Democrat-run states...WALLACE:\u00a0 But, wait a minute, some people would that it's a health risk, sir.TRUMP: Some people would say fineWALLACE:\u00a0 I mean we had some issues after Tulsa.TRUMP:\u00a0 But I would guarantee if everything was gone 100 percent, they still wouldn't allow it. They're not allowing me to do it. So they're not -- they're not allowing me to have rallies.WALLACE:\u00a0 But I've got to tell you, if I may, sir, respectfully, in the Fox poll, they asked people, who is more competent? Who's got -- whose mind is sounder? Biden beats you in that.TRUMP:\u00a0 Well, I'll tell you what, let's take a test.\u00a0 Let's take a test right now. Let's go down, Joe and I will take a test. Let him take the same test that I took.WALLACE:\u00a0 Incidentally, I took the test too when I heard that you passed it.TRUMP:\u00a0 Yeah, how did you do?WALLACE:\u00a0 It's not \u2013 well it's not that hardest test. They have a picture and it says \u201cwhat\u2019s that\u201d and it\u2019s an elephant.TRUMP:\u00a0 No no no...TRUMP:\u00a0 You see, that's all misrepresentation.WALLACE:\u00a0 Well, that's what it was on the web.TRUMP:\u00a0 It's all misrepresentation. Because, yes, the first few questions are easy, but I'll bet you couldn't even answer the last five questions. I'll bet you couldn't, they get very hard, the last five questions.WALLACE:\u00a0 Well, one of them was count back from 100 by seven.TRUMP:\u00a0 Let me tell you...WALLACE:\u00a0 Ninety-three.TRUMP:\u00a0... you couldn't answer -- you couldn't answer many of the questions.WALLACE:\u00a0 Ok, what's the question?TRUMP:\u00a0 I'll get you the test, I'd like to give it. I'll guarantee you that Joe Biden could not answer those questions.WALLACE:\u00a0 OK.TRUMP:\u00a0 OK. And I answered all 35 questions correctly.WALLACE:\u00a0 You -- you talk about how you're winning, campaigns going well. Why did you replace Brad Parscale?TRUMP:\u00a0 Because he's a great digital guy, we all like him a lot, but I have somebody that was involved \u2013 you know they were all on the 2016 campaign. We have Corey and we have all the people. And actually, Steve Bannon's been much better not being involved. He says the greatest president ever. I mean, he's saying things that I said, \"Let's keep Steve out there, he's doing a good job.\" But they're all being -- they're all involved. If Joe Biden got in, first of all, he won't call the shots. The people -- the radical left people that's around him will call. Religion will be gone, OK? Life, you could forget about that, the whole question of life. Supreme Court...WALLACE:\u00a0 When you say life, you mean abortion?TRUMP:\u00a0 Absolutely. 100 percent. That whole question, which is a very -- you know, it's always been a 50-50 thing.WALLACE:\u00a0 I understand.TRUMP:\u00a0 It's actually trending a little bit more towards one side now.WALLACE:\u00a0 When you say religion is going to be gone, what does that mean?TRUMP:\u00a0 Well, look at what they're doing to the churches. They won't let the churches even open if they want to stand in a field six feet apart. We've had churches that wanted to stand in fields six feet apart.\u00a0 There has never been an administration that's done so much as I have, from tax cuts to regulation cuts to rebuilding the military to getting choice for the vets. Nobody's done the things I've done. Nobody. In three and a half years no other president's been able to do what I've done.WALLACE: You're running in large part on the economy. You've built it once. Now we had the coronavirus. You're going to build it again. And in fact you had great jobs numbers in May, you had solid jobs numbers in June.\u00a0But I want you to look at some projections. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office says the unemployment rate at the end of the year will be 10.5 percent. JPMorgan says in the fourth quarter GDP will contract by 6.2 percent. With states now rolling back some of the reopening and...TRUMP:\u00a0 On purpose.WALLACE:\u00a0 Well, there are a lot of Republican...TRUMP:\u00a0 On purpose.WALLACE:\u00a0 Well, there are a lot of Republican states, like Texas...TRUMP:\u00a0 There is no reason...WALLACE:\u00a0 And here's...TRUMP:\u00a0 They'll be open very soon.WALLACE:\u00a0 Let me just ask my question.TRUMP:\u00a0 There's no reason for California to be doing what they're doing.WALLACE:\u00a0Alright.TRUMP:\u00a0 Except for November 3rd.WALLACE:\u00a0 With the states shutting back their reopening, in a lot of cases new lockdowns, won't the economy still be a problem for you on Election Day?TRUMP:\u00a0 I don't think so. I think the economy is expanding and growing beautifully.\u00a0 Now, the Democrats want to keep it closed as long as possible because they think that's good for elections. But I think the economy is doing very well. Now we're coming back and we're coming back at a level that nobody would have thought possible. And we are -- and by the way, take a look at another, I mean, a gauge, whether you like it or not, the stock market. The stock market, NASDAQ hit its all-time high two weeks ago and has beaten it 14 different times, ok?\u00a0 The stock market, Dow, et cetera, is a thousand points away from its all-time high, meaning very close. We're gonna have a stock market perhaps on November 3rd that\u2019s the highest in history.WALLACE: I want to talk to you about Obamacare. Since the pandemic hit, millions of people have lost their jobs and thereby lost their health insurance, and almost a half a million have signed up for Obamacare. Your administration just announced that you're signing onto a lawsuit to overturn Obamacare.TRUMP:\u00a0 And replace it.WALLACE:\u00a0Why does it make sense to overturn Obamacare which people now are relying on? Democrats are going to say, \"The man who wanted to kill Obamacare is going to take away your -- the protection for pre-existing conditions.\"TRUMP:\u00a0 First of all, we got rid of the individual mandate.WALLACE:\u00a0 I understand.TRUMP:\u00a0 Pre-existing conditions will always be taken care of by me and Republicans, 100 percent.WALLACE:\u00a0 But you've been in office three and a half years, you don't have a plan.TRUMP:\u00a0 Well, we haven't had. Excuse me. You heard me yesterday. We're signing a health care plan within two weeks, a full and complete health care plan that the Supreme Court decision on DACA gave me the right to do. So we're going to solve -- we're going to sign an immigration plan, a health care plan, and various other plans. And nobody will have done what I'm doing in the next four weeks. The Supreme Court gave the president of the United States powers that nobody thought the president had, by approving, by doing what they did -- their decision on DACA. And DACA's going to be taken care of also. But we're getting rid of it because we're going to replace it with something much better. What we got rid of already, which was most of Obamacare, the individual mandate. And that I've already won on. And we won also on the Supreme Court. But the decision by the Supreme Court on DACA allows me to do things on immigration, on health care, on other things that we've never done before. And you're going to find it to be a very exciting two weeks.WALLACE: Your niece, Mary Trump, has written a book about you and your family. And one of her main points is that she says your dad, Fred Trump, Sr., damaged the whole family and here\u2019s what she says about what you learned from your father--TAPE:ABC News/GMA July 16, 2020MARY TRUMP: He learned to become the killer you mentioned. Um the man who needs to succeed at all costs, who will do anything um to get attention, financial rewards, and to win.WALLACE: Do you see any truth in that?TRUMP: My father liked to win. My father was a very good man. He was a strong man. It\u2019s disgraceful that she said that. She was not exactly a family favorite. We didn\u2019t have a lot of respect or like for her. I would\u2019ve never said that except she writes a book that\u2019s so stupid and so vicious and it\u2019s a lie. My father was a great, wonderful man.WALLACE: Let me just ask you this question\u2014TRUMP: This is not a person that I spent very much time with, very little time, and now I\u2019m glad.WALLACE: You\u2019ve developed a pretty thick skin over the years from decades of attacks in New York tabloids, now from the press here \u2013TRUMP: Yes.WALLACE: \u2013 and your political opponents here in Washington. But even for Donald Trump, does it hurt you at all to be attacked in such personal terms?TRUMP: YeahWALLACE: By a member of your own family?TRUMP: It hurts me more about attacking my father, not being kind to my mother. I have a mother who was like a saint. She was incredible. She was an incredible woman. And she was nasty even to my mother. She\u2019s a very scarred person. She was not much of a family person.But look, let me just tell you, my father was \u2013 I think he was the most solid person I\u2019ve ever met. And he was a very good person. He was a very, very good person. He was strong but he was good. For her to say the kind of things, a psychopath, that he was a psychopath, anybody that knew Fred Trump would call him a psychopath?And you know what, if he was I would tell you. And I would say, you know Chris, I was with my father and it was imposs\u2013 my father was \u2013 he was tough, he was tough on me, he was tough on all of the kids. But tough in a--in a solid sense, in a really good sense. For her to say \u2013 I think the word she used was psychopath \u2013 what a disgrace. She ought to be ashamed of herself. That book is a lie.WALLACE: Some people were surprised when you agreed to this interview, to sit down with me.TRUMP: What are you going to ask?WALLACE: Especially because of some of the mean tweets that you\u2019ve said about me. Mike Wallace wannabe. Nasty and obnoxious. I will tell you after that one my son, Peter, who you\u2019ve met, called and he said nasty, no, obnoxious, maybe.(LAUGHTER)WALLACE: But here\u2019s the question, one of your beefs seems to be that I put Democrats on the show and I ask them questions. And I guess the question I have is, don\u2019t you understand it\u2019s my job to put Democrats on as well as Republicans? And to ask them probing questions just like I ask Republicans?TRUMP: I\u2019m not a big fan of \u201cFox,\u201d I\u2019ll be honest with you. They\u2019ve changed a lot since Roger Ailes. And I watch people like Swalwell, who I don\u2019t even know, he goes on the show, he got less than 1 percent, all of a sudden he\u2019s on \u2013 being interviewed for endless hours \u2013WALLACE: Yes, but I \u2013TRUMP: Not only him\u2014WALLACE: I interviewed Nancy--TRUMP: I watched the nastiest people \u2013WALLACE: I interviewed, you sent one tweet after I interviewed Nancy Pelosi. And in the interview I asked her specifically about the fact in February you were in Chinatown pitching tourism while the virus was spreading.TAPE: Fox News Sunday April 19, 2020WALLACE: If the President underplayed the threat in the early days, Speaker Pelosi, didn\u2019t you as well?WALLACE: Isn\u2019t that legitimate toTRUMP: I would just say that--WALLACE: --talk to the Speaker of the House?TRUMP: I would just say that \u2013 look, I know you very well, I respect you a lot, I respect your father a lot. I thought he was one of the most talented journalists there are. And you likewise are a very talented person. I do think this, I think you are a very \u2013 I think you are toward the Democrat side, which is OK. I mean \u2013WALLACE: It\u2019s not true\u2014It\u2013 watch the James Comey interview I did in December.TAPE: Fox News Sunday December 15, 2019WALLACE: Seventeen significant errors in the FISA process and you say it was handled in a thoughtful and appropriate way?COMEY: Yeah, he\u2019s right I was wrong.WALLACE: But you make it sound like you\u2019re a bystander- an eye witness- you were the director of the FBI while a lot of this was going on, sir.COMEY: Sure, I\u2019m responsible for that. That\u2019s why I\u2019m telling you I was wrong. I was over confident as director in our procedures.WALLACE: You couldn\u2019t do as tough an interview with Comey.TRUMP: OK.WALLACE: I\u2019d like to think I treat everybody the same.TRUMP: It just seems to me that you are very prone to be nice to the Democrats and maybe I\u2019m wrong about that, Chris, but it\u2019s an honor to be with you it\u2019s fine, I love it. I love that it\u2019s close to 100 degrees out today \u2013WALLACE: Your choice again.TRUMP: Yes, I know.WALLACE: I\u2019m not saying you\u2019re going to lose. I am not saying that. We saw how you turned it around last time.TRUMP: I don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to lose at all.WALLACE: But if you did, how crushing would it be?TRUMP: First of all, let me just tell you something, I know everyone wants to know that because they\u2019d love to see me lose, finally.WALLACE: I\u2019m not \u2013 I am not saying that \u2013TRUMP: You know how many times I have been written off? Do you know how many times I\u2019ve been written off?WALLACE: I\u2019ve done some of it myself, Sir.TRUMP: My whole life \u2013WALLACE: I\u2019m not doing it this time.TRUMP: Don\u2019t do it because \u2013WALLACE: But how crushing would it be?TRUMP: And you know why I won\u2019t lose, because the country in the end, they\u2019re not going to have a man who \u2013 who\u2019s shot. He\u2019s shot, he\u2019s mentally shot. Let him come out of his basement, go around, I\u2019ll make four or five speeches a day, I\u2019ll be interviewed by you, I\u2019ll be interviewed by the worst killers that hate my \u2013 my guts. They hate my guts. There\u2019s nothing they can ask me that I won\u2019t give them a proper answer to. Some people will like it, some people won\u2019t like it.WALLACE: I agree with that.TRUMP: But look \u2013WALLACE: You answer the questions.TRUMP: Let Biden sit through an interview like this, he\u2019ll be on the ground crying for mommy. He\u2019ll say mommy, mommy, please take me home.WALLACE: Well we\u2019ve asked him for an interview, sir.TRUMP: He can\u2019t do an interview. He\u2019s incompetent.There\u2019s a number you don\u2019t mention. It\u2019s called the enthusiasm number. The enthusiasm for Trump is through the roof even higher \u2013WALLACE: I have mentioned it.TRUMP: \u2013 even higher than last time. The enthusiasm for Biden is nonexistent. Everyone knows he\u2019s shot.WALLACE: But the enthusiasm against you is high.TRUMP: Well that\u2019s OK. That\u2019s his only shot.WALLACE: Right.TRUMP: And that\u2019s his only shot. I agree. And those people know I\u2019m doing a good job, but there\u2019s something in my personality that they don\u2019t like because look, nobody\u2019s done what I\u2019ve done.Biden wants to come in and ruin our country, triple your taxes. He wants to do things \u2013 he wants to add regulations that I've all cut. And we still have regulation \u2013 a lot of regulation, but I\u2019ve cut it down to a level that nobody\u2019s \u2013 nobody ever thought possible.He will destroy this country, but it won\u2019t be him. It will be the radical left. The same type ideology that took over Venezuela, one of the richest countries in the world. They now have no water, they have no food, and they have no medicine.WALLACE: Two--TRUMP: That\u2019s going to happen here--WALLACE: Two final questions\u2014TRUMP: If he wins--WALLACE: In general, not talking about November, are you a good loser?TRUMP: I\u2019m not a good loser. I don\u2019t like to lose. I don\u2019t lose too often. I don\u2019t like to lose.WALLACE: But are you gracious?TRUMP: You don\u2019t know until you see. It depends. I think mail-in voting is going to rig the election. I really do.WALLACE: Are you suggesting that you might not accept the results of the election?TRUMP: No. I have to see. Look, Hillary Clinton asked me the same thing.WALLACE: No, I asked you the same thing at the debate.TAPE: Presidential Debate, October 19, 2016WALLACE: There is a tradition in this country -- in fact, one of the prides of this country -- is the peaceful transition of power and that no matter how hard-fought a campaign is, that at the end of the campaign that the loser concedes to the winner. Not saying that you're necessarily going to be the loser or the winner, but that the loser concedes to the winner and that the country comes together in part for the good of the country. Are you saying you're not prepared now to commit to that principle?TRUMP: What I'm saying is that I will tell you at the time. I'll keep you in suspense. OK?TRUMP: And you know what? She\u2019s the one that never accepted it.WALLACE: I agree.TRUMP: She never accepted her loss and she looks like a fool.WALLACE: But can you give a, can you give a direct answer you will accept the election?TRUMP: I have to see. Look, you \u2013 I have to see. No, I\u2019m not going to just say yes. I\u2019m not going to say no, and I didn\u2019t last time either.WALLACE: Whether it\u2019s in 2021 or 2025, how will you regard your years as President of the United States?TRUMP: I think I was very unfairly treated. From before I even won I was under investigation by a bunch of thieves, crooks. It was an illegal investigation.WALLACE: But what about the good \u2013TRUMP: Russia, Russia, Russia.WALLACE: But what about the good parts, sir?TRUMP: No, no. I want to go this. I have done more than any president in history in the first three and a half years, and I\u2019ve done it suffering through investigations where people have been \u2013 General Flynn, where people have been so unfairly treated.The Russia hoax, it was all a hoax. The Mueller scam, it was all scam. It was all false. I made a bad decision on \u2013 one bad decision. Jeff Sessions, and now I feel good because he lost overwhelmingly in the great state of Alabama.Here\u2019s the bottom line. I\u2019ve been very unfairly treated, and I don\u2019t say that as paranoid. I've been very \u2013 everybody says it. It\u2019s going to be interesting to see what happens. But there was tremendous evidence right now as to how unfairly treated I was. President Obama and Biden spied on my campaign. It\u2019s never happened in history. If it were the other way around, the people would be in jail for 50 years right now.That would be Comey, that would be Brennan, that would be all of this \u2013 the two lovers, Strzok and Page, they would be in jail now for many, many years. They would be in jail, it would\u2019ve started two years ago and they\u2019d be there for 50 years. The fact is, they illegally spied on my campaign. Let\u2019s see what happens. Despite that, I did more than any president in history in the first three and a half years.WALLACE: Mr. President, thank you, thanks for talking with us.TRUMP: Thank you, thank you very much.", "comment": "", "topic": "TRANSCRIPT", "date": " July 19"}, {"cover": "https://a57.foxnews.com/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/694940094001/61697e98-835d-4548-bafe-f7699c1af8e4/fd8b1d73-90e5-45af-bae2-f1a7a1c1d85f/1280x720/match/156/88/image.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "title": "Harvard doctor 'very optimistic' that vaccine will come in early 2021, but may not be totally effective", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/politics/harvard-doctor-very-optimistic-that-vaccine-will-come-in-early-2021-but-may-not-be-totally-effective", "subtitle": "Dr. Ashish Jha of the Harvard Global Health Institute predicted that there is a likelihood that a coronavirus vaccine will be available in early 2021, but cautioned that it may not be 100 percent effective.", "keyword": "China and the world order", "website": "Fox News", "author": "Ronn Blitzer", "content": "Dr. Ashish Jha, director\u00a0of the Harvard Global Health Institute, predicted there is a likelihood that a  vaccine will be available in early 2021, but cautioned that it may not be 100 percent effective.Jha told \"Fox News Sunday\" that he was encouraged by developments in vaccine creation\u00a0in the U.S., Europe, and , and but said even if a vaccine is made available, it may not completely immunize people from COVID-19.\"Vaccines, I am very optimistic we\u2019re going to have one in early 2021. The challenge here,\u201d Jha\u00a0said, \u201cis that there are seven-plus billion people in the world. And there is going to be a race to vaccinate everybody, we\u2019re going to need billions of doses.\"He continued: \"And I\u2019m very worried about supply chains, about having enough vials and syringes, and all the stuff.\"Jha said that due to the high demand, it may take until next spring or summer before everyone in the U.S. will be able to get vaccinated.Jha was also encouraged by the number of possible vaccines in development, noting there are currently more than a dozen in clinical trials. He said he expects China to be the first to have one, possibly in the fall, but that there will likely end up being multiple vaccines that work.At the same time, Jha noted that a COVID-19 vaccine may not be the sort of shot that keeps people from ever getting the illness at all and that it may not last forever. He also said that this was not necessarily a problem.\u201cMy hope is that we\u2019ll have a vaccine that will at least stop you from getting very sick from the virus,\" he said. \"So you may still get a mild disease but you won\u2019t get very sick. Also, it might be the kind of vaccine where you need to get one every year. But that\u2019s fine, I get my flu shot every year, if I have to get a COVID shot every year, that\u2019s fine.\u201dAs far as treatment for those who already have COVID-19, Jha was less optimistic that there will be a drug that people can easily take to alleviate symptoms. While there are certain drugs that have had success in patients who are very sick, he does not anticipate there being a pill that people can take to get better.\"I would love to be wrong,\u201d he said, \u201cbut the history of antiviral therapy is not a glorious one. We just have not been able to come up with oral drugs that work super well.\"Jha also addressed the rising number of cases across the country. He blamed this in part on some states reopening too early and not following federal guidelines for a gradual reopening process, as well as \"mixed messaging on masks and social distancing.\"The doctor said he was concerned by the scene of people without masks attending President Trump's speech at Mt. Rushmore over the holiday weekend, where social distancing was not practiced.\"Those are just\u00a0risky things,\" Jha said about such gatherings, adding that President Trump should \"stick with the science\" in getting people to take precautions.\u00a0He did note\u00a0that \"outdoors is better than indoors, so I was happy to see that.\"Jha said the country is currently facing a \"perilous moment,\" and that some states must be \"very aggressive\" in combating spikes. He said that going back to \"shelter in place\" practices \"should absolutely be the last thing that you want to get to,\" but said that if the virus is not under control it will be \"very hard to keep schools open.\"While cases numbers have increased, death counts have not followed the same trends. Jha said that this could be due to several reasons.Death statistics often lag behind case numbers because it takes time for people to get sick and die from the disease. At the same time, he noted that doctors are getting better at treating people, so some patients may still be quite sick, but will ultimately survive.

Damaging public transportation facilities and arson would constitute acts of terrorism. Any person taking part in secessionist activities, whether organizing or participating, would violate the law regardless of whether violence is used.It comes after a full year of pro-democracy protests in the former British territory that was handed over to China 23 years ago on the condition that it would keep\u00a0a high degree of autonomy from mainland China and a British-style rule of law \u2014\u00a0a \"one country, two systems\" framework. China has slowly encroached on Hong Kong's autonomy, leading U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo early this year to declare that it is \"no longer autonomous.\"\"The United States Congress on bipartisan basis has long been united in our mission to hold Beijing accountable for its brutal crackdown against those peacefully demanding their rights and freedoms, including in Hong Kong,\" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said of the bill's passage Wednesday.She added: \"Today\u2019s action is an urgently needed response to the cowardly Chinese government\u2019s passage of its so-called \u2018national security\u2019 law, which threatens the end of the \u2018one country, two systems\u2019 promised exactly 23 years ago today.\u00a0All freedom-loving people must condemn this horrific law, which is purpose-built to dismantle democratic freedoms in Hong Kong.\"Texas Rep. Michael McCaul, the top Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said in a statement, \"As Americans we must do everything we can to support the freedom loving Hong Kongers fighting against the CCP\u2019s tyranny. The US is determined to impose consequences.\"And on the heels of the House legislation Wednesday, the State Department Thursday morning released a letter to American businesses warning of \"reputational, economic and legal\" problems they could see by continuing to do business with companies in the Xinjiang region of China. The Chinese government has run internment and forced labor camps there, which hold\u00a0an estimated 1 million Uighur Muslims, according to a report by .The Chinese government has also required forced sterilization of Uighurs in what the State Department's letter called \"some of the most serious acts involving mass human rights abuses since the Second World War...\u00a0The aim of the internment has been to force members of these minority groups to renounce their ethnic identity and religion, and to embrace the ideology of the Chinese Communist Party.\"Pompeo on Tuesday slammed the imposition of the repressive Hong Kong law.\"The Chinese Communist Party\u2019s decision to impose draconian national security legislation on Hong Kong destroys the territory\u2019s autonomy and one of China\u2019s greatest achievements,\" he said. \"The United States will not stand idly by while China swallows Hong Kong into its authoritarian maw. Last week, we imposed visa restrictions on [Chinese Communist Party]\u00a0officials responsible for undermining Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy. We are ending defense and dual-use technology exports to the territory. Per President Trump\u2019s instruction, we will eliminate policy exemptions that give Hong Kong different and special treatment, with few exceptions.\"The House legislation would take those actions by the State Department a step further. A Congressional Research Service summary of the legislation says it provides for sanctions against \"foreign individuals and entities that materially contributed to China's failure\" to respect Hong Kong's autonomy and \"foreign financial institutions that knowingly conducted a significant transaction with such identified individuals and entities.\"The sanctions against financial institutions would be mandatory and the sanctions against \"entities and individuals\" would be at the discretion of the president, unless they are named on State Department reports as helping violate Hong Kong's autonomy for two consecutive years.The Senate passed a similar bill earlier this month. The sponsors of that bill, Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., and Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., said they plan on getting the Senate to match its legislation with the House's to send it to the president's desk \"as soon as\" Thursday.\"Tens of thousands of Hongkongers are in the streets protesting and refusing to surrender their basic rights to the Chinese Communist Party,\" Toomey and Van Hollen said.\u00a0\"They are doing so even as CCP collaborators harshly crackdown on free speech and the right to assemble.

Virtually all photos and renderings of the J-31, since first unveiled, revealed a striking resemblance to the U.S. F-35. This does not come to the surprise of many in the U.S., given China\u2019s well-known and documented cyberespionage efforts. A 2014  Congressional report specifically cites a Defense Science Board finding that Chinese cyberattacks resulted in the theft of significant specs and technical details of a range of U.S. weapons systems\u2014including the F-35.At the same time, a 2018 Pentagon news story about DoD\u2019s annual China report mentions that apparent similarities between the F-35 and Chinese could very well be a result of espionage. A cursory look at the J-20 does appear to show some resemblance to the F-35, particularly the blended wing-body front end and internally built, conformal exhaust pipes. These similarities do appear, despite the apparent differences, as the J-20 has a wider and longer lower-body. However, available photos show an even larger measure of similarity between the F-35 and Chinese J-31 multi-role fighter.As recently as last year, another said the J-31 showed design improvements at the 2019 Paris Air Show. Photos from the story reveal profound visual similarities between the F-35 and J-31. This is not without precedent, as the Chinese media itself has noted similarities between the two aircraft. Portions of a story from the Chinese government\u2019s \u201c as far back as 2013 specifically cites design similarity between the emerging Chinese J-31 and the F-35, writing that the \u201cJ-31 and F-35 use the same DSI inlet (non-boundary layer-separated lane supersonic inlet).\u201d The only major difference, the paper notes, is that the U.S. has an F-35B Short Take Off and Landing variant and that the J-31 uses two engines compared to the F-35\u2019s single-engine propulsion configuration.The article\u2019s reference to a \u201cnon-boundary layer separated lane supersonic inlet\u201d appears both interesting and significant, as it pertains to designs engineered to manage heat and air movement signatures demonstrated by the aerodynamic phenomenon of airflow surrounding supersonic flight. \u201cBoundary layer\u201d aerodynamics, referring to the airflow surrounding a weapon or platform as it transits, can greatly impact the flight stability and stealth characteristics of an aircraft.A pertinent comparison can be found in the Air Force Research Laboratories\u2019 current work on \u201cboundary layer phenomenology\u201d related to next-generation hypersonic weapons. Senior Air Force science and technology leaders and weapons developers told me at the Air Force Association symposium in 2019 that \u201cboundary layer phenomenology\u201d was figuring prominently in ongoing research and development regarding future weapons and platforms. Managing heat flow and temperature is, of course, vital to maintaining flight stability for hypersonic weapons traveling at speeds up to five-times the speed of sound. Developers seek to engineer configurations that will generate a \u201claminar\u201d or smooth airflow as opposed to \u201cturbulent\u201d boundary layer to enable a weapon to sustain an accurate trajectory and manage excessive heat.Therefore, by extension, it seems apparent the same aerodynamic principles apply to stealth aircraft configurations that seek to manage the heat signatures and turbulence potentially generated in the airflow boundary layers of stealth jets flying at supersonic speeds. Accordingly, a \u201cnon-boundary layer separated lane\u201d for airflow, (as cited by the article) which does not break up or radically change airflow trajectory, could not only ensure smoother flight at high speeds but also help manage temperature. Of course, there would be significant differences between the thermal management technical engineering needed for hypersonics and stealth aircraft, yet smoother wing-body melded external designs, absent hard or protruding edges, clearly bring the added advantage of a smoother and cooler air flow boundary layer. Along these lines, the 2019 Global Times report details a few design changes to the 2019 J-31 which, according to the photographs, show a smoother, less-jagged exterior behind the cockpit compared to earlier models.The Chinese newspaper stops short of exploring a fully-detailed discussion of aerodynamic designs related to the aircraft, but does cite a Chinese Air Force test pilot expert as saying \u201cthe J-31\u2019s stealth aerodynamic design, stealth engine design and stealth coating design have all reached internationally advanced standards in stealth technology.\u201d (China\u2019s Air Force test pilot expert Xu Yongling.However, external configuration and some elements of visible heat-signature management represent merely a few of many characteristics when it comes to stealth technology; stealth designs also often incorporate internally-built engines, radar-absorbent coating materials and internal weapons bays, among other things. Along these lines, the People\u2019s Daily Online report makes the claim that the J-31 has a superior weapons payload capability compared with the F-35. However, available specs report that the J-31 travels with six external weapons hardpoints\u2026 the same number as the F-35.As for how the J-31 may be employed, Chinese and U.S. newspapers are filled with various kinds of speculation; some reports say the fighter is intended for export as a way to counter the reach and scope of the F-35, however other reports cite Chinese officials saying the J-31 is intended for domestic use and possibly could even fly off of Chinese aircraft carriers.Chinese progress with the J-31 calls to mind several timely strategic calculations. A more recent Congressional report, the , makes specific reference to concern regarding China\u2019s expansionist aims when it comes to projecting air, land and sea power.

Few people have deeper knowledge and a more impressive resume\u00a0in terms of\u00a0preparing for the future of space travel.It\u2019s\u00a0vital\u00a0for Americans to understand that, in the long\u00a0run, no issue is more important than\u00a0U.S. leadership in\u00a0space.As Miller told me, in the future whoever dominates space is going to be able to control Earth and dictate the planet\u2019s culture and values. The next decade or two will determine\u00a0whether the future of humanity\u00a0will be\u00a0governed by freedom and respect for the individual or by oppression and repression.China seems to understand what\u2019s at stake\u00a0and has more launches into orbit than the U.S. The Chinese government is giving its commercial space companies huge subsidies to grow a massive industry.The Chinese are also copying and stealing American and Russian\u00a0technology.\u00a0Beijing is growing its commercial space capabilities rapidly, investing in the effort\u00a0to influence the future.The Chinese threat in space is real, and America cannot become complacent.\u00a0The U.S. needs to\u00a0let\u00a0private companies like SpaceX\u00a0innovate and lead America into the future in space\u00a0travel and habitation. Commercial efforts will be far more efficient than NASA, which has a crucial role to play but shouldn\u2019t be the driving force.Space holds\u00a0effectively unlimited resources and can provide boundless opportunities for humanity. But if China\u2019s communist dictatorship outpaces the U.S. in space, hope will quickly turn into despair.I hope you will listen to this week\u2019s\u00a0.

Trump has championed religious minorities, including persecuted Christians in the Middle East and Uighurs in China, and gained the release of Pastor Andrew Brunson from a Turkish prison.And Trump\u2019s tough stance on Communist  signaled the most dramatic shift in Sino-American relations since Nixon\u2019s diplomatic opening to Beijing in\u00a01972.\u00a0For decades China has stolen the intellectual property of U.S. companies, engaged in illegal trade practices, and brutally denied the human rights of its people, most recently by crushing democracy in Hong Kong.\u00a0Its persecution of the underground church is notorious. As with Ronald Reagan\u2019s posture toward the Soviet Union, Trump\u2019s policy links China\u2019s rogue behavior with its brutal denial of human rights.Conservatives long ago learned that personnel is policy. Trump understands this principle, most boldly perhaps in his appointment of Mike Pompeo as Secretary of State.\u00a0Pompeo, a full-spectrum conservative with a distinguished career in the U.S. Army, Congress, and the CIA, has made it his mission to rescue America\u2019s long and cherished tradition of advocating human rights from UN bureaucrats and muddle-headed liberalism.Last year Pompeo created the Commission on Unalienable Rights, chaired by the distinguished Harvard professor Mary Ann Glendon. The commission\u2019s newly-released report issues a clarion call for placing human rights at the center of U.S. foreign policy, based on the Declaration of Independence and American tradition.The Declaration advanced the most radical idea in human history: that all human beings are endowed by God with certain inalienable rights. The sole duty of government is to safeguard those rights. These rights would later be enshrined in the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. Freedom of religion, speech, assembly, and the press are now widely recognized as foundational to civic health and prosperity, yet they remain denied in much of the world.Pompeo\u2019s commission faults the United Nations for making a mockery of human rights, allowing China, Cuba, and Libya to dominate the UN Human Rights Council.\u00a0The U.S. resigned from the UNHRC in 2018 because it did not want to\u00a0remain part of a hypocritical council. A prime example of the UNHRC's hypocrisy was displayed the following year when the council allowed Venezuela to win\u00a0a seat despite having one of the worst records on human rights in the world.Trump\u2019s critics charge that the U.S. is abdicating its leadership and retreating from the global stage.\u00a0But viewed through the prism of the Declaration and the UN\u2019s own Declaration of Universal Human Rights in 1948, the U.S. is actually providing moral clarity and leadership by example at a time when both are much needed.\u00a0 The Commission on Unalienable Rights offers a road map for foreign policy should Trump win a second term.\u00a0Too often given short shrift by the media, the Trump administration has sanctioned dictators from the mullahs in Iran to the corrupt Maduro regime in Venezuela, which holds power after a sham election, robs its citizens of basic rights, and starves them with failed economic collectivism.\u00a0The Trump Administration has promoted liberty and human rights while avoiding overweening military commitments.Could Trump, elected in no small measure because he promised to build a wall, be the instrument for bringing down the walls of oppression that rob so many of their God-given rights and potential?\u00a0 If the blueprint provided by his State Department\u2019s Commission on Unalienable Rights is any indication, his administration could do so, offering hope to those struggling to be free across the globe, while confounding its critics.

It needed nine votes to pass and no vetoes. It will renew the Syrian cross-border aid program, which expired Friday, but only via a single border crossing in the northwest.The program allows aid to be funneled into Syria by keeping open crossings on the borders in the north of the war-torn country. Russia in January vetoed a resolution that would see four crossings opened and forced the council to pass a resolution that reduced it to just two in the northwest on the border with Turkey: Bab al-Salam and Bab al-Hawa.Humanitarian groups and officials had warned of a humanitarian catastrophe if the program was allowed to expire, particularly with the COVID-19 outbreak -- and  there could be\u00a0\"mass graves\" if Russia didn't drop its opposition to it being extended.A majority at the council, including the U.S., wanted both those crossings extended, and a third crossing -- Al Yarubiyah -- opened on the northeast border with Iraq in order to get aid to an estimated 1.3 million stranded Syrians in need of medical supplies.Al Yarubiyah was removed from the resolution to overcome a Russian veto, but Russia and China still wielded their vetoes twice, on Tuesday and on Friday. Russian drafted amendments and resolutions, meanwhile, were repeatedly shot down overwhelmingly, with no need for vetoes.Saturday\u2019s resolution keeps Bab al-Hawa open for 12 months, but it means Bab al-Salam will close, and there will be no border crossing open in the northeast.Craft, who had visited the refugee camps in March, said it was a victory that Bab al-Hawa was kept open, but expressed disappointment at the loss of the other two crossings.\u201cTo be clear, today\u2019s outcome leaves us sickened and outraged at the loss of the Bab\u00a0 Al Salam and Al Yaroubia border crossings. Behind those locked gates are millions of women, children, and men who believed that the world had heard their pleas. Their health and welfare are now at great risk,\u201d she said.\u201cYet there is no question that the Council\u2019s authorization of cross-border humanitarian access through Bab al-Hawa for 12 months is a victory in light of the Russian Federation and the People\u2019s Republic of China\u2019s willingness to use their veto to compel a dramatic reduction in humanitarian assistance,\u201d she said.Secretary Antonio Guterres, meanwhile, said that the reauthorization would ensure assistance for 2.8 million people in the northwest.\u201cThe Secretary-General also reiterates his call on all parties to the conflict to ensure humanitarian access to all people in need in accordance with international humanitarian law,\u201d spokesman Stephane Dujarric said.Russia, meanwhile, claimed\u00a0that \u201cthe cross-border mechanism was used by some external players as a tool to freeze dividing lines in Syria thus jeopardizing integrity of Syria breaking apart its regions.\u201d\u201cIt contradicts the principle of respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Syrian Arab Republic, which has been repeatedly confirmed in the Security Council resolutions, including this resolution,\u201d Russian Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia said in an explanation of its vote.The Russian and Chinese blockage of broader resolutions\u00a0also saw\u00a0criticism from humanitarian groups.\u201cThe cynical and cruel maneuvering of Russia with China\u2019s support is one more tragic example of the broken U.N. humanitarian system, and a defamation of the Security Council's charter,\u201d Susannah Sirkin, director of policy at the U.S.-based Physicians for Human Rights, said in a statement. \u201c Exercising their veto over the will of the Council and succeeding in closing one critical border crossing risks cutting off life-saving aid to more than four million Syrians.\u201dThe negotiations make clear the difficulties the U.S and other countries face in overcoming opposition from Russia in particular -- Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad\u2019s closest ally -- to pass Syria-related resolutions at the Security Council given Russia's veto power.The Friday vetoes mark the 15th and 16th veto by Russia of a Syria resolution since the Syrian conflict began in 2011 and the ninth and 10th by China.", "comment": "(64)", "topic": "UNITED NATIONS", "date": " July 11"}, {"cover": "https://a57.foxnews.com/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/694940094001/3f7e2ff8-5619-4110-96dc-f4a2fc2a62f5/0423aeec-eed7-4f2c-a718-77fc1b810fd8/1280x720/match/156/88/image.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "title": "TikTok star leaves platform amid concerns over Chinese company misusing user data", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/media/tiktok-star-leaves-chinese-data-triller", "subtitle": "TikTok\u00a0star\u00a0Josh Richards is leaving the\u00a0social media app\u00a0over concerns\u00a0that\u00a0its\u00a0Chinese\u00a0parent\u00a0company misuses user data.\u00a0\u00a0", "keyword": "China and the world order", "website": "Fox News", "author": "Brian Flood", "content": "TikTok\u00a0star\u00a0Josh Richards is leaving the\u00a0social media app\u00a0 misuses user data.\u201cAfter seeing the U.S. and other countries\u2019 governments\u2019 concerns over\u00a0TikTok\u00a0\u2014 and given my responsibility to protect and lead my followers and other influencers \u2014 I followed my instincts as an entrepreneur and made it my mission to find a solution,\u201d\u00a0Richards told the .Richards, 18, who will leave behind over 20 million followers, has taken a position as\u00a0chief strategy officer at L.A.-based music video app\u00a0Triller, the Times reported.Fox News confirmed\u00a0Richards\u2019 new role.TikTok\u00a0influencers\u00a0Griffin Johnson, Noah Beck and Anthony Reeves will join Richards at\u00a0Triller\u00a0as\u00a0advisers.\u201cThe move is significant because it is one of the first organized U.S. efforts among prominent\u00a0TikTok\u00a0influencers to get people off the platform.

Josh Hawley, R-Mo., on Wednesday pushed for\u00a0 commissioner Adam Silver to testify before \u00a0after the league replied to a letter he'd sent earlier this month\u00a0regarding the protection of players who publicly criticize Communist .In the\u00a0 to\u00a0Silver, Hawley asked why the league was allowing players to wear certain political messages on their jerseys while disallowing anything critical of the CCP.\"Conspicuously missing from the list of approved phrases are any in support of the victims of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), including the people of Hong Kong, whose remaining freedoms are being extinguished by the CCP\u2019s newly-enacted national security law,\" he wrote.\u00a0\"Given the NBA\u2019s troubled history of excusing and apologizing for the brutal repression of the Chinese Communist regime, these omissions are striking.\u00a0Last October, you no doubt recall, you chose to apologize to the CCP after Daryl Morey, General Manager of the Houston Rockets, spoke up on behalf of the Hong Kong protestors.\"Following that shameful display, I encouraged you to reverse course,\" Hawley continued. \"Instead, you have spent the intervening months deepening the NBA\u2019s ties to the CCP.\"He added:\u00a0\"The league\u2019s new policy suggests a newfound commitment to enhanced employee expression. But that free expression appears to stop at the edge of your corporate sponsors\u2019 sensibilities. And for woke capital today, profits from the Chinese market are more popular than patriotism...\u00a0If I am right \u2013 if the NBA is more committed to promoting the CCP\u2019s interests than to celebrating its home nation \u2013 your fans deserve to know that is your view. If not, prove me wrong.\"Hawley urged the league to step forward in support of Hong Kong and law enforcement and also asked that phrases such as \u201cBack the Blue,\"\u00a0\u201cSupport our Troops\" and \u201cGod Bless America\" be included for players to choose from.He also said the NBA's refusal to address such matters \"speaks volumes\" about their actions and posed several questions for the league, which he expected to be answered\u00a0by July 29.Deputy Commissioner Mark Tatum complied with\u00a0Hawley's timetable,\u00a0but \"would not commit to protecting employees or players who publicly criticize the Chinese Communist Party,\"\u00a0according to the senator.\" finally replies to me. Won\u2019t criticize  and won\u2019t commit to protecting employees who criticize . Says it\u2019s all \u201chypothetical.\u201d Uh, remember Daryl Morey?\" the Missouri Republican tweeted.In their\u00a0response, the league said only certain \"social justice messages\" are acceptable for\u00a0players'\u00a0jerseys. They also claimed the idea that any player would speak out against China is a \"hypothetical\" scenario and therefore cannot be fully addressed.\"The whole letter is a joke,\" Hawley added.\u00a0\"Reads like lawyers in Beijing drafted it. Maybe it\u2019s time to hear directly from Adam Silver. On Capitol Hill. Under oath.\"Hawley ended the thread  to an  about the NBA's China academies -- a youth development program --\u00a0which labeled the operation as \"abusive\" and included quotes from sources who claimed\u00a0American coaches \"were frequently harassed and surveilled in Xinjiang.\"One American coach was reportedly\u00a0detained three times without proper cause, causing a former league employee to compare the atmosphere in Xinjiang to \"World War II Germany.\"Tatum assured ESPN the NBA is \"reevaluating\" and \"considering other opportunities\" for the academy program, which is operated out of sports facilities run by the Communist government. Last week, the league acknowledged for the first time that it had closed the Xinjiang academy, but Tatum refused to say if it was connected to human rights abuses, ESPN reported.\u00a0\"We were somewhat humbled,\" he said.Hawley suggested this be one of the main topics discussed if Silver testifies before Congress.", "comment": "(34)", "topic": "NBA", "date": " July 29"}]
