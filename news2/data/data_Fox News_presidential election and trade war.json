Thanks for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo. Straight ahead right here on \"Sunday Morning Futures\": brand-new polls out on the presidential election coming up. Crime is up across the country, public trust is down, with just 107 days until election 2020, this as Congress returns to work tomorrow to hammer out a new coronavirus relief package before the August recess. They have got two weeks House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy on what to expect, as millions of Americans fear rent protections and extra unemployment benefits are set to expire. White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows is here with an insider's look from the White House, as the screws keep turning on China. Attorney General Bill Barr calls out corporate America for kowtowing to Beijing. Senator John Kennedy will join me with what his move will be next. Also, global investor Ray Dalio is here responding to A.G. Barr's warning about China. Plus, what does all of this mean for the 2020 election? Former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon with his message on President Trump on what it will take to win in November. All that and a lot more, as we look ahead right here, right now on \"Sunday Morning Futures.\" All that coming up, but, first, flags across the Capitol are at half-staff this morning in remembrance of civil rights icon John Lewis. The longtime Georgia congressman passed away Friday night after a battle with pancreatic cancer. He was 80 years old. A great patriot, Lewis was the last living speaker at the 1963 March on Washington, where Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his \"I Have a Dream\" speech. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy was his friend and colleague. He joins me now. Congressman, it is good to see you this morning. My condolences. REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA): Good to see you, Maria. Thank you. And I do want to talk about John Lewis just for a moment, because he lived such an extraordinary life and was an unbelievable man. At such a young age, he tried to cross a bridge simply to give people the right to vote. He did it in a peaceful manner. And he was beaten almost to his death. I have walked across that bridge with him before. And when he would tell the story, he would stop at a moment and says, I cannot remember past beyond this point, because they would beat him. And he did it in a peaceful manner to help change this nation that no longer do people are -- choice about which bathroom they use or which counter they eat on, or even registering to vote. BARTIROMO: Yes. MCCARTHY: He made this nation better. And he lived his life in a manner that we can all respect and live up to. And he was kind to all. And he -- I just spoke to him a couple weeks ago, checking on his health, but talking to him about what's happening in the nation today, because he did it in a peaceful manner to help preserve and to actually create a more perfect union. I think can -- a lot to understand him and live by his example to make this nation better. BARTIROMO: Yes, thank you for that. When we go to break, after our interview, we're going to show a little clip of John Lewis, which is a beautiful clip and something that I know that our audience will love. So, stay with us for that. But let me get to the business at hand for our viewers. And you're going back to -- Congress will return to work tomorrow. And you are looking at a potential next stimulus package, a relief package. What should be in that package, Congressman? MCCARTHY: A number of things should be in that package. But we also have a large amount of money, more than about $1.5 trillion, still out there that we have already appropriated that we need to get into this economy. But the things I look for are the things we need to do. We need liability of protection, because these small businesses are questioning whether they can open again, our schools and others. So, let's protect those as we move forward. Let's also look at, any time you're using federal money, it shouldn't give you a -- de-incentivize the ability to work. We have made a mistake where we overpaid on unemployment insurance, where now it's hard for people to come back to work because they're making more on unemployment than they can working. So we have got to straighten that out as we move forward. I would look at places that we could -- should prioritize the safety when it comes to child care or for our children and our teachers inside schools. And then I would look at the supply chain. If we learn nothing from this, not the lies of China, but bringing those jobs back to America, but also our supply chain itself, not being beholden to China for so much of our critical minerals and others. Let's find a way that we improve it here and for our stockpiling. I would do that in a different manner, working with the private sector to stockpile it. BARTIROMO: Well, so the president would like schools to open in the fall, Congressman. Will there be money in this next bill for schools? And what about the states? Are these the priorities right now for that next bill? MCCARTHY: Well, the uniqueness of what we have right now, Maria, we have more than $100 billion that we have already appropriated that can go to the states. I think we can look at ways that we can make that greater flexibility. And lots of times, we're finding, when we sent these moneys to these governors, that they have held it up, instead of pushing it down to the counties and the cities. I would like to see more flexibility, where it goes to the counties and cities in the place of need. We would look at hospitals if they need more in the process of where we're going forward. BARTIROMO: Yes. MCCARTHY: We also have more than $100 billion sitting there for such a successful program of PPP for small businesses that saved millions of jobs. Now we're seeing that some states have to close certain portions. Is there a greater need for small businesses? We already have money sitting there. BARTIROMO: Well... MCCARTHY: So, could we use the money already appropriated to solve some of these problems? BARTIROMO: Sure. I understand. But, you know, the Democrats are pushing back on the president saying he wants to open schools. And I wonder how much of this is politics, although, you know, it is scary for parents to say, we're going to send our kids back to school, and we don't know what the situation is in terms of the coronavirus. We're seeing spikes across the country. Here is what President Trump told me just recently when I interviewed him at the beginning of this pandemic. Listen to this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BARTIROMO: Your critics want you to keep it closed going into the election? DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Yes, I do. I do. I think it's a political thing, in addition. I think some sense... BARTIROMO: Because they're saying you're putting money, business ahead of lives. TRUMP: No, no. I think the people that want to see the right thing happen, they agree with me. We have to get our country open. You know, if it was up to some people, let's keep it closed for a long time, OK, a long time. And watch the United States go down the tubes. Not going to happen. (END VIDEO CLIP) BARTIROMO: I mean, I guess we are going to be living with this, Congressman. But can we actually go back to our normal lives safely right now, given these spikes that we're seeing across the country? MCCARTHY: In certain parts of the country, you can. Nobody wants to send somebody to school that's unsafe. That's why Congress should actually look at this. How can we protect when it comes to child care, the children in school and the teachers? But what's more important, when you look at these recent studies, you're finding that children can -- should not -- have not kept their reading, their writing and their math, losing more than 30 percent of it. We cannot have a whole generation that's uneducated. BARTIROMO: Yes. MCCARTHY: So, what we need to do is actually put that plan together, because we have got to make sure schools can reopen. And that takes a responsibility of what we're doing. Now we're finding, even in California, where L.A. and San Diego say they're not going to open for the whole year? BARTIROMO: Wow. MCCARTHY: Remember what is happening here with Warp Speed. We have got five companies that are in BARDA that have a real promise of having a vaccine, could even be this year, or the therapies that are coming forward. Tomorrow is going to be better than today, based upon what this administration is doing. BARTIROMO: Yes, but look what is happening to our cities. MCCARTHY: Yes. BARTIROMO: Look what's happening to our cities. I know you have a bill right now to punish anybody who is taking down statues. But there's a massive movement across the country on the other side of the aisle. Your colleagues on the left, they want to defund the police. Listen to Joe Biden recently. Here it is. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) QUESTION: Can we agree that we can redirect some of the funding? JOSEPH BIDEN (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Yes, absolutely. One of the things that we also need to be doing is fundamentally changing the way -- and I have been pushing it for years -- changing the way we deal with our prison system. It should be a rehabilitation system, not a punishment system. (END VIDEO CLIP) BARTIROMO: Well, what does that mean, Congressman? Because we are seeing this bail reform in New York allow criminals back on the street. And that's one of the reasons crime is skyrocketing. What is your responsibility, as the leader of the GOP, to get law and order back in place in this country? MCCARTHY: Well, every American should be scared right now, because what you just showed country was Joe Biden said, yes, he is for defunding the police. You have got Congresswoman Omar, who wants to dismantle America. Then you have got Nancy Pelosi, who is allowing them to destroy America from statues and on. We have a responsibility for rule and law and for justice. And what we're watching the Democrats doing -- watch what Nancy Pelosi just said the other day. She thinks what's happening is -- in Portland is a graffiti problem. No, it's a mob problem that is overrunning. You have people across this nation scared to death. You have young children being murdered... BARTIROMO: Yes. MCCARTHY: ... because what they're doing to the police department. This is wrong. I introduced a bill... BARTIROMO: So, your bill -- your bill does what? MCCARTHY: When law... BARTIROMO: Yes. MCCARTHY: Our bill will withhold federal grants for cities that do not uphold and protect the statues... BARTIROMO: OK. MCCARTHY: ... because the cities have the responsibility for law and order, not to leave these precincts, not to allow these mobs to rule our communities. BARTIROMO: Wow. Yes. MCCARTHY: We have to stand up to this. BARTIROMO: It is scary out there. I agree with you. Congressman, it's good to see you this morning. We certainly will be watching the developments. Thanks so much, Congressman Kevin McCarthy, this morning. We will see you soon, sir. Thank you. Coming up: White House chief of staff Mark Meadows on the hot seat over the administration's response to the coronavirus. As we take a break, a look at the late, great John Lewis. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BARTIROMO: Welcome back. We have got new FOX News polls released this morning. And it shows coronavirus is the number one issue for voters headed into the 2020 election. More than half of them disapprove of how the president has handled this pandemic. I'm joined right now by the White House's chief of staff, Mark Meadows. He has been leading the administration through this crisis. And, Mark, it is good to have you this morning. Thanks very much for joining us. First off, what can you say to your critics who say the president has fallen short in his response to the pandemic? MARK MEADOWS, WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF: Well, obviously, any time that we get faced with something that is new and unusual, you actually have to engage. And so this came from China. In the last four or five months, we have been having to figure out how to provide personal protective equipment, ventilators, making sure that we have hospital beds. And I can tell you, as we look forward, there are a number of things that we're working on to make sure that we have the therapeutics, even as recent as, this morning, shipments going to Florida and Indiana and other places to make sure that some of the treatments that are needed in these critical areas are actually happening. And I also can tell you that it's a 24/7 around-the-clock kind of work. I was on the phone with the president this morning, as we were working on some of the responses. You will see some new initiatives coming out this week, as the president is not only leading, but will continue to lead and step in a number of fronts. One of those that you just mentioned earlier, Maria, is about our schools. How are we going to open our schools and make sure that moms and dads don't have to worry about the safety of our children that are going back to schools? And so there will be over $70 billion that this president has already authorized to work with Congress to try to make sure that we not only keep the classrooms safe, but the teachers safe and the students safe. BARTIROMO: Right. MEADOWS: And you will see a very broad five to six points in terms of what we will be doing in terms of making sure that our schools are safe. BARTIROMO: That's really important. Obviously, we are going to have to live with this for a little while, before we get the innovation from our pharma sector and a vaccine. Tell me what the president would like to see in another relief package, Mark. Where are we in terms of the relief and the impact on the economy and people's livelihoods? MEADOWS: Well, there's -- the discussions have just started over the last week or so. We have been having a number of internal discussions over the last couple of months. But, as we have started to engage with our Senate and House colleagues up on Capitol Hill, those will start in earnest starting tomorrow. Monday, I know that Leader McConnell and Leader McCarthy will be coming into meet with the president and Steven Mnuchin, who is leading it from our side, to actually start to fine-tune it. So I'd see there's three different areas that we're going to make sure of, that we have enough money to make sure that we expedite not only the Warp Speed as it relates to the treatments that we have, whether it be therapeutics or vaccines, but we also want to make sure that we keep people employed. When you look at the economy and where we need to go with it, we're not going to be shy about making sure that we have protections for the American worker and those that employ individuals. And so you're going to see an additional thrust there. It looks like that that new package will be in the trillion-dollar range, as we have started to look at it, whether it's a payroll tax deduction, whether it's making sure that unemployment benefits continue, without a disincentive to return to work. And then, bluntly, we're looking at a number of areas to look at manufacturing, bringing some of those critical manufacturing jobs back from overseas, so that we're never put in a situation where we have to depend on foreign countries to make sure that we can protect Americans. BARTIROMO: And the president has talked about the crime across the country as well. Is there something coming in terms of an executive order on returning law and order to this country? MEADOWS: Well, he's already done a couple of things. But he's working very closely with Attorney General Barr. I can tell you that, this week, what we're looking at is not only looking at what a lot of people have called the executive order on statues, which he did that. But that's really -- the statues are one thing, but it's really about keeping our communities safe. And the president's committed to do that. Some of the unrest that we saw even in the last month or so, but particularly last night and the week leading up to it, in Portland, it's just not acceptable, when you look at communities not being safe and not upholding the rule of law. BARTIROMO: Yes. That's right. MEADOWS: So, Attorney General Barr is weighing in on that, with Secretary Wolf. And you will see something rolled out this week as we start to go in and make sure that the communities, whether it's Chicago, or Portland, or Milwaukee, or someplace across the heartland of the country. We need to make sure that our communities are safe. BARTIROMO: Mark, let me turn to the Russia probe. You did such an excellent job when you were on the Oversight Committee in terms of zeroing in on the origins of the Russia probe. We now know, for sure -- Lindsey Graham told us this about a month ago, actually, so our audience was aware, that the FBI knew that the dossier was just made-up garbage, and the subsource told the FBI agents that. And yet Jim Comey and Andrew McCabe kept on pushing forward, renewing warrants to spy on Carter Page. Your reaction to what we know now. And when are we going to hear from John Durham? Will there be indictments, sir? MEADOWS: Well, I think the American people expect indictments. I know I expect indictments, based on the evidence I have seen. Lindsey Graham did a good job in getting that out. We know that they not only knew that there wasn't a case, but they continued to investigate and spy -- and, yes, I use the word spy -- on Trump campaign officials, and, actually, even doing things when this president was sworn in, and after that, and doing it in an inappropriate manner. You're going to see a couple of other documents come out in the coming days that will suggest that, not only was the campaign spied on, but the FBI did not act appropriately as they were investigating. It's all starting to come unravel -- to unravel. And I tell you, it's time that people go to jail and people are indicted. BARTIROMO: It's just unbelievable that, for three years, this president was investigated and investigated again over something that wasn't even true, and the entire country was up in arms about collusion. I mean, you know, I don't hear anything on the other side of the aisle about this wrongdoing, which is just stunning to me. MEADOWS: Well, it is stunning. And here is the interesting thing is, it's not only that it wasn't true. The problem is, they knew it wasn't true. BARTIROMO: Right. MEADOWS: And when you know something is not true, and you continue the investigation, that's collusion. That's the kind of thing that we must stop. And that's what we -- where we need to hold people accountable. BARTIROMO: Mark, it's great to have you this morning. Please come back soon. Thanks so much. MEADOWS: Thanks, Maria. BARTIROMO: Mark Meadows joining us there. Coming up next, Louisiana Senator John Kennedy with breaking news on what to expect from the Senate, as we look ahead on \"Sunday Morning Futures.\" Stay with us. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Lawmakers are returning to Washington tomorrow to negotiate the next coronavirus relief package, but can both sides reach an agreement before millions of Americans lose their extra unemployment benefits at the end of July? Joining me right now with his expectations for a bill is Louisiana Senator John Kennedy. He serves on the Banking, Budget and Appropriations Committee. Sir, it's great to see you this morning. Thanks so much for joining me. SEN. JOHN KENNEDY (R-LA): You bet. BARTIROMO: What are your priorities for a next stimulus bill? Do you want to get something out before the recess starts again on August 8? KENNEDY: Well, it depends on what's in the bill, Maria. I don't know what's going to be in the bill. I don't know if there will be a bill. And, frankly, neither does anyone else. It takes 60 votes to pass a bill in the Senate. The only thing I'm certain of right now is that the bill we pass, if we pass one, will not be Speaker Pelosi's bill. It is untethered to reality. And among most senators, including many Democrats, it's about as popular as a sinkhole. Among the topics that we will talk about will be, number one, maybe the most important, getting our schools open, money, extra money for K-12. Most fair-minded people believe that keeping our schools closed will do far more damage to our kids than the coronavirus ever can. Having said that, I know a lot of parents are scared. If you don't want to send your child back to school, you shouldn't, and you shouldn't be forced to. And if you're a teacher or an employee, and you don't want to go back, don't. That's between you and the school board. But I think we will have enough kids, enough teachers, and enough employees, with the right resources, to get our schools open. We probably shouldn't have closed them down to begin with. BARTIROMO: There is also some consensus on limiting ability for businesses, schools, and government in terms of their liability. Is there consensus there? Will that be in the next bill? KENNEDY: There's not a consensus on anything. But the other issues we will talk about will be, as you pointed out, limiting liability for our schools and our universities and our hospitals. We will work on trying to give relief to people laid off who lose their health insurance. We will talk about additional PPP. We will talk about additional unemployment compensation. Payroll tax cut will be on the table, as will direct stimulus payments to American people. BARTIROMO: OK. KENNEDY: But, again, there's not a -- there's not even close to a consensus yet. BARTIROMO: You are also working on a bill. I want to move on to China. You're working on a bill that will prohibit American companies from collaborating with the Chinese Communist Party. A really stunning speech this week by Attorney General Bill Barr. Let's hear that. And then I want to get your take on where we are with China. Here is Bill Barr. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WILLIAM BARR, U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL: The ultimate ambition of China's rulers isn't to trade with the United States. It is to raid the United States. If you are an American business leader, appeasing the PRC may bring short- term rewards, but, in the end, the PRC's goal is to replace you. (END VIDEO CLIP) BARTIROMO: Pretty stunning comments there, Senator. What can you tell us about this? The A.G. called out technology companies Cisco, Google, Microsoft, Yahoo, Apple, all by name. What is at stake if these companies continue working with China? KENNEDY: General Barr, in my estimation, is absolutely correct. The Chinese people are wonderful people, but their government, the Communist Party of China, is comprised of a bunch of outlaws. They're bullies. They understand only strength. If you're too nice to them, if you turn the other cheek, they just stab you in the neck. The poster child for what the general was talking about is the leadership at the National Basketball Association. The NBA leadership is so greedy, so anxious to do business in China that they do whatever the Chinese Communist Party tells them to do. If the party told the leadership of the NBA to join the Taliban, the NBA leadership would say, where's the line? I'm working on a bill that would prohibit American companies from giving in to this bullying by the Communist Party of China. It would say, basically, if you give in to them, you violate American law. Now, it's a delicate bill to draft, and we're working on it. BARTIROMO: Yes. KENNEDY: But Barr is right. BARTIROMO: We want to show you this video of the Uyghurs in China. Now, this video was shot in 2018, so it's not new. But what it clearly shows are the Muslims and the Tibetans that are locked up in camps in China. They are blindfolded. They are being lined up. And what can you tell us? What is the responsibility of the free world to take a stand against these people being locked up in China? The Chinese Communist Party has pushed back and said, it's none of your business what goes on in other countries, Senator. KENNEDY: \u00a0Well, in my estimation, what the Chinese Communist Party has done to the Tibetans and the Uyghurs is despicable. All the Tibetans and the Uyghurs want to do is practice their religion. And the Communist Party in China says, your religion is the Communist Party of China. And we have to stand up to them, not just other governments, other Western democracies, but those who value free enterprise as well. And for those of my colleagues on Capitol Hill who admire the authoritarian socialist approach of countries like China... BARTIROMO: Yes. KENNEDY: ... I will just tell you, look at the Uyghurs, look at the Tibetans. Look what China is doing now, causing mischief with India, in the South China Sea, in Hong Kong. All they understand is -- I don't want to start a cold war with China, but weakness invites the wolves. And we have to be firm with them. BARTIROMO: Yes. And, on Thursday, the president signed the Hong Kong sanctions bill, unanimously passed by the bipartisan Senate. This is an important message. I just will point out that China has already sanctioned Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz. (LAUGHTER) BARTIROMO: And they say that this is holding -- this is for them holding CCP officials accountable for what's going on in China, Senator, real quick. KENNEDY: I think Ted and Marco probably will wear the sanctions as a badge of honor. For 20 years, we have been told by the commentariat that we have to be patient with China, that free enterprise will change them. BARTIROMO: Yes. KENNEDY: They're trying to change free enterprise. BARTIROMO: Senator, thank you so much. We will be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Well, it is 107 days until America will vote for its next president, in what could be one of the most important policy-based elections in history. My next guest knows what it takes to win the White House. He helped lead Donald Trump to victory in 2016 as the chief executive of his campaign. Joining me right now is once again former White House chief strategist, host of \"War Room: Pandemic,\" Steve Bannon. Steve, it's great to see you this morning. Thanks for being here. We want to roll out these polls this morning from FOX News and get your take on all of this, because, once again, we see the president lagging. What do you think is going on? Here is President Trump on the economy, 47 percent approve, 47 percent disapprove, Steve. And then you have got other polls which show the president lagging Joe Biden. Your take? STEVE BANNON, FORMER WHITE HOUSE CHIEF STRATEGIST: Listen, when you go back and look in -- I think it was in March, 51 percent of the American people thought President Trump was doing a good job, a solid job in leadership on this pandemic. I think, in the poll, it's 37, 38 percent, something like this. This is about just bold action and bold leadership. What I think the president should do, my recommendation would be, every day, start to have the top people around you, Dr. Fauci, Dr. Birx, the vice president, Dr. Redfield at CDC, Chief of Staff Meadows, have them in the Oval, get briefed every day on an action plan, just drive action, action, action, and do it through action, urgency, and focus. And get a plan for masks. Get a plan for the schools. Bring the governors in, but with those five people around the desk. And then every couple of days, you bring in the media, and you tell them what the plan of the day is. You tell them where we're driving action. President Trump is a man of action. When he's taken action on whether shutting down China, shutting down Europe, declaring this a national emergency, when President Trump is taking action, the polls reflect this. I would -- I think the polls should be an indication to people in the White House that, hey, you're in the driver's seat here. Just go back to the plan you have got. And, also, you have made a decision about federalism, I think, is very smart, but include the governors now, particularly as this kind of weaponized virus is impervious to summer heat and humidity. It also is asymptomatic. It also targets and looks like it targets the most vulnerable. And so this is where they have to have, I think, targeted interventions. I think Dr. Birx has talked about this in the past. The White House has all the elements. I think it's just bringing it together around President Trump in a principals only, and every couple of days bring the media in there and let President Trump explain what actions he's taking, not one of these two- hour press conferences, where the media can throw out all these other questions. But focus on the pandemic. If you focus on the pandemic, you will start to make real progress. And I think the polls will all start to fall in place. Remember, the CCP lied. Americans died. I think the president can take leadership in this and drive this. And I think the polls will take care of themselves. BARTIROMO: What can you say about Joe Biden's plans right now, Steve? This week, the former vice president unveiled a climate plan to cost $2 trillion. Look, he is going to be raising taxes. He's already discussed that, that he's going to be raising taxes. If Elizabeth Warren is his running mate, she -- or not -- she could be Treasury secretary, but she will certainly be an important, key voice in the economy. She wants to institute a wealth tax. You know, look, we are facing a $22 trillion debt. And you would say, OK, you have to raise taxes in that regard. But he's using that higher revenue to come up with things like a $2 trillion green plan. What's your take on Biden's agenda? BANNON: Look, Biden doesn't know what his agenda is. He's trying to reinvent himself every other day. He goes up to Scranton, Pennsylvania, and makes this kind of populist economic nationalist speech. He's really the concierge of Wilmington, Delaware, which is the headquarters of all the global corporations. You know, Joe Biden, to me, has to come forward to the American people and tell what his plan on China is. The president's kind of war council has laid out the four horsemen of the Apocalypse against the Chinese Communist Party, the national security adviser, head of the FBI, the secretary of state, and then obviously Secretary -- Attorney General Barr in that magnificent speech. Those four individuals laid out an integrated and coherent war plan to confront the Chinese Communist Party on technological and information war and economic war, and then, with our allies, start to open up the South China Sea, and support our allies in India on the border of Chinese- occupied Tibet. You're seeing an integrated war plan put together to take down -- confront first and then take down the Chinese Communist Party, to call their bluff. And Joe Biden, in his entire speech the other day on economics, mentioned China, I think, one time, talking about electric vehicles. Joe Biden is the candidate of globalization. He's a total globalist. He has kowtowed to the Chinese Communist Party. The president has a coherent plan against the Chinese Communist Party. I would like the secretary of Treasury to join in there and Treasury to start to drop the hammer. But you have seen a coherent war plan. I think you have just got to get that same level of coherence on the Chinese virus that's here, the CCP virus that has come to the United States. And I think, if you do that, things will come together. And I don't think Joe Biden has an answer. So far, it's been virtually incoherent. BARTIROMO: Yes, I want to come back to the China story in a second. But who do you think Joe Biden will choose as his vice presidential candidate? BANNON: Well, I think the polling internal to Biden, the number one thing they're looking at is somebody that can't -- that can't throw him off the - - where he's going right now. So, I think whether it's Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris, I think they're looking at a number of candidates. I don't think it's going to matter, at the end of the day, who his V.P. is, because, really, I think Joe Biden is the one that is going to get smoked out. If President Trump continues to drive action, that -- and Biden is going to be smoked out and going to have to really confront President Trump on the hustings. And I just don't think he's going to stand up. BARTIROMO: Yes. BANNON: Right now, remember, he -- nothing he puts forward is really coherent. And he's trying to reform himself as a -- or rebrand himself as a populist and economic nationalist, against 45 years of his track record. It is going to be very, very difficult, as the Trump campaign, as a full -- force multiplier off of what's happening at the White House, I think, begins to really identify and kind of brand Joe Biden for what he is. BARTIROMO: Yes, that was an incredible speech that A.G. Barr made this week, basically calling out corporate America, Steve, to say, look, you can not collaborate with the Chinese Communist Party, that you are putting profits over the short term ahead of the real issues around national security over the long term. Do you think, increasingly, companies are getting it, or are they still seeing the opportunity to sell widgets to 1.4 billion people? BANNON: Well, they better get it, because he put a shot across their bow when he talked about FARA, and he said, hey, not only -- he used the word - - remember, this is a very smart guy. He used collaborator and appeasement, OK, collaboration and appeasement. Those words were specifically chosen by Attorney General Barr to put corporate America on notice. Then he talked about FARA. He talked about you guys being lobbyists and actually being unregistered foreign agents. So this is something that he really threw down on. And I have got to tell you, it was a magnificent speech. The other ones of the NSA director, of the FBI director, of Pompeo also have to be reviewed in an entire context of where President Trump is taking this, really, I think, as a war leader, on economic and information war. What we have to do today is then stop playing games with the CCP. Stop being a supplicant about this virus. We have to tell them, I believe, you turn over every piece of information, you open up the P4 lab, you let Americans and other scientists from around the world go in there and interview everybody, get every document, or we're going to cut you off. We're going to cut you off from the U.S. dollar. We're going to sanction your banks. BARTIROMO: Wow. BANNON: And we're going to sanction the highest members of the Chinese Communist Party, Wang Qishan and Xi. It's time for -- President Trump has got a great saying: no games. It's time to stop playing games with this murderous dictatorship. BARTIROMO: Yes. BANNON: They lied. The American people have died. Their own people have suffered immensely. BARTIROMO: Wow. BANNON: The Communist Party -- people -- the Chinese Communist people -- the people there are innocent victims of this dictatorship. Bill Barr called it out. Right now, Secretary of State Pompeo has to say, you open up every lab. BARTIROMO: Yes. BANNON: And the secretary of Treasury should come in, with the backing of the president of the United States... BARTIROMO: Yes. BANNON: ... and say, we're off the dollar. We're sanctioning every bank. We're going to sanction individuals, until you come clean. BARTIROMO: Oh, my goodness. BANNON: And we're going to get therapeutics and a vaccine and know exactly what this thing is. Listen, this thing being asymptomatic, this thing being... BARTIROMO: Yes. BANNON: \u00a0... impervious to humidity and heat, this thing targeting the most vulnerable population, the aged, comorbidities, minorities... BARTIROMO: OK. BANNON: ... this virus, we know very little about. It's time for them to stop hiding the information. BARTIROMO: All right, we got to jump. My next guest will have a thing or two to say about that. I will speak with Ray Dalio, global investor. Steve Bannon, thank you so much. We will be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Attorney General Bill Barr this week called on American companies to stop appeasing the Chinese Communist Party, saying -- quote -- \"The ultimate ambition of China's rulers is not to trade with the United States. It is to raid the United States. If you are an American business leader, appeasing the PRC may bring short-term rewards, but, in the end, the PRC's goal is to replace you\" -- from A.G. Bill Barr this week. Joining me right now is the co-chief investment officer, the co-chairman and the founder of Bridgewater Associates, Ray Dalio, who has studied China and dynasties for decades. Ray, it's great to have you this morning. Thanks so much for joining us. RAY DALIO, CO-CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER/CO-CHAIRMAN, BRIDGEWATER ASSOCIATES: \u00a0Good to be here. BARTIROMO: And I know that you have been to China many times. You have invested in China. What is your reaction to what you're hearing from Bill Barr, Ray? DALIO: Well, look, I'm a mechanic. I'm -- I just look at cause-effect relationships and what things are like, and so not ideological. I have been to China, as you say, for 35 years. And I watch them. And I -- we're operating in a world in which they are a, let's call it, worthy opponent, that each country seeks to do what's in its own interest. And there's a battle over wealth and power. And that's internal or external. And each company, when they go there, forms their own view about what it's like. And then there's law. And so the way I view that comment or that assessment is that, if the government is going to do something that will have an effect, they will have to create laws, and that those laws will determine what companies are going to do. They will behave according to those laws. BARTIROMO: Right. DALIO: Otherwise, you're going to have individual companies make their own assessments. And from my assessment of going to China and being there, it's not like the China that is being painted. It's not this communist -- it is highly capitalist. The enterprise system is operating, meaning, you go there, and the innovation and the things are powerful. And that's why you're seeing so many issues with competition. It's -- Huawei is about competition. And their technologies are quite amazing. So, it is a definitely worthy opponent. BARTIROMO: Yes. DALIO: And what's happening now, in the rise of a great power to challenge an existing great power, is the same sort of thing that's happened in the 1930-to-'45 period. So I hope we have a chance to talk about that, because there are other things that are related... BARTIROMO: Yes. DALIO: ... that all come together to determine -- to set the stage that we're now in. BARTIROMO: Well, I want to talk more about this, because you say Huawei is quite competitive, but isn't Huawei a collection of assets of Nortel Networks? Was many of those assets stolen? I mean, how do you look at China as a player that is just a competitor, when, in fact, they may very well be stealing intellectual property? I want to get into that when you -- when we come back. Let's take a short break. We're talking with Ray Dalio this morning. And he's not only looking at China, but the enormous amount of stimulus thrown at this economy. We will get into it when we come right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) \u00a0BARTIROMO: And we are back with Bridgewater's co-chairman and co- investments officer, Ray Dalio. And, Ray, we were talking about China. I do want to get into the broader economy and the impact there. You have been studying stimulus, in terms of all of this money being thrown at this economy. What do you think the implications are, Ray? DALIO: I'm going to pick up quickly with your China piece, and then I will come to the other. I'm just a practical man who has studied histories. And what's happening now has happened all through the history. In particular, I studied the rises and declines of empires and the reserve currency, starting with the Dutch -- they had the world empire -- the British, the United States, and now. BARTIROMO: Right. DALIO: And through that period of time, there is what you call stealing. There has always been the taking of ideas. The British took, hired architects, who took from the Dutch, who had the shipbuilding. And that was their main competitive advantage. It's a reality. And I think it's important to see that arc. Part of that arc, as you're referring to, has... BARTIROMO: It's an important point. DALIO: Sorry? Part of... BARTIROMO: I said it's an important point that you're making. DALIO: Yes. There's an arc in which it's like competition. They might -- internally, you might say somebody's stealing their ideas. Well, that's right. I mean, that's just the practicality. And in the world, you don't have the same kind of rules. It's more of a jungle. You don't have laws. And so it's just a practicality... (CROSSTALK) BARTIROMO: So, should we just say, well, China is going to beat us? I mean, should we just sit back and say, well, look, this is a threat and that's it? DALIO: No. No, I think you just have to see it for what it is, and deal with it well, right? In other words, don't deal with it emotionally. Approach it like a chess game. If I make this move, it will have this implication. And so I think, if it was clear -- questions like, do you want to go to war? There is -- there are four types of wars brewing. There is a trade war, there's a technology war, there's a geopolitical war, and there might be a capital war. BARTIROMO: Yes. DALIO: And so just do you want to approach it as that? How do you approach it intelligently to win that war? Our biggest issue is our own... BARTIROMO: Ray, we really need to talk about the economy. We need to talk about the economy. We hope you will come back next weekend, Ray. Thank you so much, Ray Dalio joining us. And that'll do it for \"Sunday Morning Futures.\" I'm Maria Bartiromo.

Only very specialized organisms can survive in the highly corrosive atmosphere that is toxic to most living things.Trump\u2019s immediate predecessors,  and , were alike in the gift for surviving amid the sulfuric acid by seeming impervious to it. Whether they actually shattered remote controls and cussed blue streaks in private we can\u2019t know, but their public personas were those of men rising above.Now, both knew how to exploit the atmosphere. Obama made hay out of the attacks on him (including Trump\u2019s efforts to prove him a secret Kenyan) and by wading into various controversies. Bush was even more cautious, but certainly profited by the culture wars, especially on same-sex marriage. But both preserved a presidential bearing and at least the appearance of some remove.Trump, on the other hand, is a human magma vent. His political success, as we have often discussed, has substantially relied on his gift for media manipulation. You can bet, for example, that any day when the news is bad for the president, he will attempt to discharge enough sulfur to change the story.It\u2019s not surprising then that facing at present a potential drubbing, Trump is trying to do what he does best. Right after his admirers are done defending him against accusations of race baiting, Trump tweets \u201cwhite power\u201d or defends the Confederate Flag.It may be that Trump lacks the discipline and patience to sustain a more subtle approach to taking advantage of the raging culture wars. But it may also be true that he believes his plan works. After all, it has before.What\u2019s worse for Trump, trading accusations of racism with Democrats and political journalists or another day focused on the surging coronavirus? Every politician would like to have the ability to switch the narrative, but not every politician can or will endure the sulfuric blowback that might be needed.You can see his logic here. If Trump could win once riding atop an eruption of upset and outrage, why couldn\u2019t he do it again? His symbiotic counterparts in the political press certainly do their part to puff up each new outrage. Trump uncorks some culture war discharge, his critics swallow it whole and the cycle is perpetuated with a back and forth over who was more wrong and blah, blah, blah\u2026Aside from keeping coverage pointed away from even more uncomfortable topics, it also keeps Trump\u2019s base occupied. The way to lose in a landslide is to have your own voters give up hope. That\u2019s how you get wiped out: Knowing defeat is inevitable, your people don\u2019t bother voting. That\u2019s exactly the scenario that has Senate Republicans sweating like a cold drink on a hot day. That helps explain why Trump is trolling so hard. It\u2019s fan service.However\u2026The more obvious answer is that what works for an outsider, first-time candidate won\u2019t work for an incumbent president. It\u2019s certainly harder to play the victim and it\u2019s impossible to avoid the judgment of voters as they reflect on a first term and imagine what a second term might be like.Trump is well suited to highly acidic atmospheres, but most voters are not. While Trump\u2019s diversions keep the press and Democrats away from his weaker spots, they also reinforce his weakest one at all: Fatigue.Americans grow weary of every president sooner or later, which is why re-elected ones tend to become lame ducks so quickly. Since the dawn of the television age, each president becomes part of the furnishings of our lives. Eventually, we tire of the d\u00e9cor. That happened sooner for Trump than any.Trump and some Republicans tried the same approach in 2018, including with the same fight over statues. But it didn\u2019t work then.The problem is that while you\u2019re keeping your foes off topic, you\u2019re also showing persuadable voters that you\u2019re out of touch with their concerns. Lots of people feel deeply about these wedge issues, but not many who don\u2019t already have their minds set.\n\u201cExperience is the oracle of truth; and where its responses are unequivocal, they ought to be conclusive and sacred.\u201d \u2013\u00a0: \u201cNASA's most powerful space telescope, Hubble, captured a uniquely picturesque galaxy in a photo the agency released on Thursday. The galaxy, called NGC 2775, is located 67 million light-years away and doesn't seem to be forming stars that much anymore. Astronomers can tell that's the case because of the relatively empty, clear bulge at the galaxy's center. When it was younger, the galaxy's middle region was likely bursting with activity as gas condensed into newborn stars. Now, however, all the gas seems to be used up. The arms spinning around the galaxy's center are \u2018flocculent\u2019 \u2014 fluffy and feathery-looking \u2014 due to dark lines of dust and puffs of gas clouds.

The resurgence of the virus across the south and west of the U.S.\u2026 has complicated the push to bring groups of children into schools.\u00a0Decisions about how and whether to reopen schools are largely up to state and local governments\u2026 But\u00a0Mr. Trump\u00a0has repeatedly made his stance clear. \u2018SCHOOLS MUST OPEN IN THE FALL!!!\u2019 he wrote in a tweet Monday. \u2018You forgot to add the word \u2018SAFELY,\u2019 tweeted back\u00a0, president of the National Education Association\u2026\u201d-\u00a0: \u201cThe Florida Department of Education issued an emergency order on Monday mandating that all of its schools must reopen for the fall semester, following months of closure due to the coronavirus. The order, signed by Commissioner of Education\u00a0, addresses all school boards and charter school governing boards. It says that all \u2018brick and mortar schools\u2019 must reopen beginning in August at least five days per week and that they must follow the guidelines as set by the Florida Department of Health\u2026The department\u2019s order further requires all schools that accept state scholarship money to submit a reopening plan that satisfies the state\u2019s requirements.\u201d\u00a0\u201cThe Republican Party will provide mandatory coronavirus testing at its August national convention in Jacksonville, according to a memo delivered on Monday. The plan to require thousands of attendees to get tested for the coronavirus before entering the convention site illustrates the efforts the party is undertaking to ensure President Donald Trump speaks to a packed house when he accepts the nomination. U.S. Senator\u00a0, an 86-year old Republican from Iowa, said on Monday that he will skip the Republican National Convention in August due to coronavirus concerns. The Jacksonville Host Committee has not provided details on the logistics or how the cost will be covered.\u201d -\u00a0: \u201cFirst came the announcement of a downsized convention in Milwaukee that delegates were urged not to attend in person. Now, Democrats are questioning whether even gathering in smaller events throughout the country as an alternative is a plausible option after a new surge of Covid-19 cases. With infection rates exploding in several states, some elected officials, state party leaders and rank-and-file members of the Democratic National Committee are skeptical about the proposed idea of \u201cmini-conventions\u201d across the nation \u2014 regional satellite sites for delegates and party leaders, particularly in battleground states.\u201d -\u00a0: \u201cNew coronavirus cases soared in California over the July Fourth weekend, stressing some hospital systems and leading to the temporary closure of the state capitol building in Sacramento for deep cleaning, officials said on Monday. The number of people hospitalized with COVID-19 has increased by 50% over the past two weeks to about 5,800, Governor\u00a0\u00a0said at a briefing. About a third of those hospitalized were in Los Angeles County, state and local records showed, with about 630 confirmed and suspected coronavirus patients requiring intensive care. And 25% of the hospitalizations in the county in July were among patients aged 18 to 40, health officials said, as new cases increasingly hit a younger population that may have been lax about safety precautions in recent weeks.\u201d\u00a0-\u00a0: \u201cThe personal protective gear that was in dangerously short supply during the early weeks of the coronavirus crisis in the U.S. is running low again as the virus resumes its rapid spread and the number of hospitalized patients climbs. A national nursing union is concerned that gear has to be reused. A doctors association warns that physicians\u2019 offices are closed because they cannot get masks and other supplies. And Democratic members of Congress are pushing the Trump administration to devise a national strategy to acquire and distribute gear in anticipation of the crisis worsening into the fall.\u201d -\u00a0: \u201cAtlanta mayor\u00a0\u00a0announced Monday that she had tested positive for COVID-19. The 50-year-old Democrat is among the women named as a potential vice-presidential running mate for presumptive presidential nominee . \u2018COVID-19 has literally hit home. I have had NO symptoms and have tested positive,\u2019 Bottoms tweeted. She told MSNBC that she decided her family members should get tested again because her husband \u2018literally has been sleeping since Thursday.\u2019 She said the only other symptoms she and her husband have been experienced are those similar to allergies they have.\u201d: \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s upbringing in a deeply dysfunctional family makes him a uniquely destructive and unstable leader for the country, his niece writes in a scathing new book obtained by The Times, perhaps the most personal in a series of deeply unflattering tell-all accounts about the president.\u00a0paints a disturbing portrait of her uncle, saying he paid a friend to take his SATs so he could get into college and grew up bending the truth to promote himself. The future president\u2019s father was a \u2018high-functioning sociopath\u2019 and his mother \u2018emotionally and physically absent.\u2019 \u2018Honest work was never demanded of him, and no matter how badly he failed, he was rewarded in ways that are almost unfathomable. He continues to be protected from his own disasters in the White House,\u2019 writes Mary Trump, the daughter of the president\u2019s eldest brother,\u00a0.\u201d -\u00a0: \u201cJoe Biden\u00a0has added two Philadelphians with extensive experience in Pennsylvania politics to lead his campaign operation in a state critical to the presidential election and his hopes of winning the White House. Biden on Tuesday named\u00a0\u00a0as his Pennsylvania state director and\u00a0\u00a0as senior adviser in the state, the campaign first confirmed to the Inquirer Tuesday. McPhillips, who lives in Point Breeze, most recently led\u00a0\u2019s campaign in Iowa, helping the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., pull off a surprising first-place finish. McPhillips previously managed Pennsylvania Lt. Gov.\u00a0\u2019s primary campaign for U.S. Senate in 2016 and\u00a0\u2019s successful 2015 City Council run. He also led\u00a0\u2019s 2018 bid for governor of Florida.\u201d: \u201cData released Monday by the Small Business Administration shows that businesses owned by members of Congress and the law practice that represented\u00a0President Trump\u00a0were among the hundreds of thousands of firms that received aid from the agency. As part of its $660 billion small-business relief program, the SBA also handed out loans to private schools catering to elite clientele, firms owned by foreign companies and large chains backed by well-heeled Wall Street firms. Nearly 90,000 companies in the program took the aid without promising on their applications they would rehire workers or create jobs. The data, which was released after weeks of pressure from media outlets and lawmakers, paints a picture of a haphazard first-come, first-served program that was not designed to evaluate the relative need of the recipients.\u201d -\u00a0: \u201cAs much as $273 million in federal coronavirus aid was awarded to more than 100 companies that are owned or operated by major donors to President Donald Trump\u2019s election efforts, according to an Associated Press analysis of federal data. Many were among the first to be approved for a loan in early April, when the administration was struggling to launch the lending program. And only eight businesses had to wait until early May before securing the aid, according to the AP\u2019s review of data released Monday\u2026All told, the Trump supporters who run these companies have contributed at least $11.1 million since May 2015 to Trump\u2019s campaign committees, the Republican National Committee and America First Action, a super PAC that has been endorsed by Trump, the AP review found. Each donor gave at least $20,000.\u201d-\u00a0: \u201cThe White House wants Congress to pass another stimulus package by the first week in August, before lawmakers head home for their annual summer recess, and to keep the cost at $1 trillion or less, according to Vice President\u00a0\u2019s top aide. \u2018I think we want to make sure that people that are still unemployed or hurting are protected but at the same time, we want to take into consideration the fact the economy is bouncing back and want to try to contain the amount of spending,\u2019\u00a0, Pence\u2019s chief of staff, said Tuesday in an interview with Bloomberg Radio...The White House and lawmakers are set to intensify talks on a new package of virus-related stimulus this month, as they return to Washington after the Independence Day holiday.\u201d: \u201cJoseph R. Biden Jr.\u2019s home state is holding a presidential primary, and New Jersey has a full slate of congressional primaries on tap in an election that will be held mostly by mail...For Democrats in New Jersey and across the country, Representative\u00a0\u2019s switch to the Republican Party in December, after the impeachment vote against President Trump, was nothing short of a betrayal. Potential opponents began quickly jockeying to take on Mr. Van Drew in what will be one of November\u2019s most watched congressional races. But the primary battle in South Jersey has turned toxic, fracturing the state\u2019s Democratic establishment along lines both familiar and foreign to those who closely follow the political machinations of Trenton. Backing\u00a0, a mental health advocate and former teacher who is part of the Kennedy political diaspora, is Gov.\u00a0, along with progressive activists and labor unions who often side with him.\u201d -\u00a0\u00a0\u201cUtah\u2019s GOP gubernatorial primary was called Monday for Lt. Gov.\u00a0\u00a0by the Associated Press after new results showed him continuing to hold onto a lead over former Gov.\u00a0Cox, who\u2019s scheduled to hold a news conference Tuesday afternoon, said in a statement that he and his running mate, state Sen. , R-Spanish Fork, \u2018are humbled by the vote of confidence from the people of Utah in selecting us as the Republican nominee for governor and lieutenant governor.\u2019 He said \u2018as farm kids from Sanpete County,\u2019 he and his wife, , \u2018never dreamed of having this opportunity. If elected in November, we will take our rural values of hard work, honesty and responsibility to the governor\u2019s office each day.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cWell, the vice president says he will transform America. He will. And the American people will pay a fearsome price. His foreign policy is hugs and hot cocoa for America\u2019s enemies. If he\u2019s elected, my advice to you is to build a fallout shelter.\u201d\u2013\n\u201cI am troubled by your report of the recent \u201cNASCAR\u201d tweet of the President. \u2026that excerpt omits the key fact that\u00a0Bubba Wallace\u00a0has nothing to apologise for because he had no role in reporting the alleged hate crime, nor in its investigation.\u00a0 The Fox News report you cite included \u2018I don\u2019t think  has anything to apologize for,\u2019 South Carolina Sen.\u00a0\u00a0said\u2019 and both the presenters on the Fox News video clip and your friend\u00a0\u00a0went out of their way to explain to viewers that the matter was not a hoax and that Wallace was not involved. Fair and balanced reporting which is what I expect from the Halftime Report, and that surely requires you not to selectively edit a balanced report of a misleading tweet in a way that \u2018removes the antidote but retains the bane\u2019. I don\u2019t imagine you will publish this but I hope you recognise your own responsibility to take care not to create nor to propagate, by selective editing, a fake narrative.\u201d --\u00a0\u201cI loved and, agreed, with your response to\u00a0\u00a0on 7/1. 'If I were advising [Trump], I\u2019d tell him to be as boring as possible for at least the next two weeks.' I was definitely interested in how POTUS's messaging and tone would or wouldn't change in the following days. Over the weekend and then with culture war remarks (ie asking\u00a0Bubba Wallace\u00a0to apologize) today, 7/6, I have a new hypothesis. Trump understands at this point the uphill struggle to get re-elected. The messaging and tone he'd have to use to winover independents or undecided voters would not affect his base voting for him, but could affect his 'hero' status to his most faithful supporters. Trump political media enterprise post-election anyone? I don't think any traditional GOP or mainstream conservative is excited about him rehashing culture war issues. It sure doesn't seem like a strategy to broaden his base for an electoral college victory. Cheers,\u201d --\u00a0\u201cI suppose I should know the answer to this question but, as hard as it is to believe, I have some doubt that I would be right. We do have two senior men currently running for President so the following situation, although highly unlikely, is possible.\u00a0 Suppose President Smith is running for re-election against Mr. Jones.\u00a0 And suppose Mr. Jones wins the election.\u00a0 Alas, a few weeks before Mr. Jones is sworn into office as President, he dies.\u00a0 Normally the Vice President would become President.\u00a0 But the only Vice President we have has also lost the election.\u00a0 In any event we do still have President Smith in office at this point. My question is on Inauguration Day who is sworn in as President?\u201d --\u00a0: \u201cBreaking the story of\u00a0\u2019 historic contract extension probably wasn\u2019t part of the job description when one Missouri liquor store employee applied for the position.\u00a0But when the time came,\u00a0\u00a0did just that. Camlin, who works at Plaza Liquors in Kansas City, tweeted that a Chiefs employee had come into her store to buy a load of champagne for an apparent celebration. \u2018A front office employee for the Chiefs came in and bought six bottles of Dom Perignon. Said there\u2019s a big signing today. He said it\u2019s not\u00a0, so my guess is a Mahomes deal,\u2019 Camlin tweeted before eventually deleting it, according to the Kansas City Star.

A \"Father's Day Special\" broadcast,\u00a0in which President Trump was interviewed by his eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., drew 5.2 million views, whil the Black Voices for Trump organization has held nine broadcasts that have drawn more than 18 million views\"When we see the\u00a0numbers of registered\u00a0Republicans outpacing that of\u00a0Democrats in key swing states\u00a0we're doing something right,\" Gidley told MacCallum. \"Money [is being] raised at\u00a0a\u00a0pace nobody\u00a0thought possible and that's\u00a0because we have a great\u00a0candidate.\"MacCallum then pressed Gidley on whether plans to\u00a0hold the Republican National Convention in Jacksonville, Fla., are still on despite the increase in coronavirus cases across the state.\"We're looking to move\u00a0forward with it in Jacksonville -- the president is very excited about it -- but he\u00a0wants the American people to be\u00a0safe,\" Gidley answered.\u00a0\"He cares about the health and\u00a0the safety and the security of\u00a0the people that come to the\u00a0convention ...

But in the end, all lost and none made it to the\u00a0Oval Office.Keep this\u00a0in mind when you read and watch\u00a0all the\u00a0news stories\u00a0now predicting that  is headed for defeat when he faces former Vice President  in the November presidential election.Polls are snapshots in time and far from infallible. They can vary wildly depending on who is polled, how questions are phrased and many other variables. All this is not a matter of opinion. It\u2019s an indisputable fact.As just one of many examples of how wrong polls often can be,\u00a032 years ago this week The New York Times\u00a0published\u00a0a story with the\u202fheadline\u202f\u201cDukakis Lead Widens, According to New Poll.\u201d The Times reported that\u00a0Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, then the Democratic presidential nominee, was ahead of then-Vice President George H.W. Bush by an eye-popping margin of 55 percent to 38 percent in the 1988 race for president.I could fill a book with polling results that turned out to be just as\u00a0inaccurate.In the wake of\u00a0all the\u00a0polling failures\u00a0cited above and more,\u00a0all\u00a0public\u00a0election\u00a0polls\u00a0should have an asterisk next to the results\u00a0and say\u00a0\u201ccould be wrong.\u201dIt\u2019s worth noting that a recent\u202fpoll\u202ffound that 62 percent of those surveyed are afraid to share their political views in the current environment.\u202fIn the age of President Trump, getting accurate data is becoming\u00a0almost\u00a0impossible.\u00a0After all, if you vote for Trump, tell a pollster you\u2019re voting for Trump or show support for the president on social media, you might be attacked as a racist or perhaps even fired from your job, as a\u00a0teacher in\u00a0Michigan\u00a0alleged recently.In the current toxic political situation caused by the left\u2019s unhinged reaction to the election of the ultimate political outsider Donald Trump, it\u2019s quite obvious that if someone was afraid to tell a pollster about their intention to vote for Trump for fear of retribution in 2016, that fear has grown exponentially over the past four years.Similar to the 2016 Brexit vote, polling in the 2016 Trump-Clinton race didn\u2019t capture the under-vote that showed up in force on Election Day.\u202fThis is an election year unlike any we\u2019ve ever witnessed.\u00a0America is in the midst of a pandemic that has caused massive economic hardships.\u00a0There is racial unrest and violence and destruction of property in our streets.These enormous variables make snapshot surveys unreliable, to put it\u00a0mildly.\u00a0Moreover, just like there\u00a0is an\u00a0anti-Trump bias in the vast majority of newsrooms\u00a0that are dominated by liberals and those even farther left, bias exists in polling as well.In these hyper-politicized times, too many polls are deeply flawed. In some cases, this may be deliberate by those on the left. In others, even\u00a0good-faith\u00a0attempts at accuracy fail.Too many polls settle for a sample of registered voters rather than likely voters.\u00a0Furthermore, with the push for all-mail voting on account of the unprecedented COVID-19 crisis, how can we truly ascertain who\u00a0is\u00a0a likely voter and who isn\u2019t?\u202fThese are uncertain times; standard polling practices may not be cutting the mustard this year.\u202fBe that as it may,\u00a0polls showing Trump trailing Biden are getting far more attention than they deserve, particularly in liberal media outlets that make little effort to hide their open and intense hostility to Trump and other Republican candidates.Just look at the Times, where supposedly objective reporters are so filled with anti-Republican bias that they succeeded in getting the publisher to remove the editorial page editor and demote his deputy because the editors dared publish an op-ed by Republican Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas.Biden\u2019s political allies in the media are trying to cement in people\u2019s minds that the outcome of the election is a foregone conclusion,\u00a0just like they\u00a0tried to do in 2016.I recall vividly when I received exit polling information early on election night 2016 that included data from Colorado. The problem was that Colorado has all-mail voting, so there could be no exit polling available.The moral of the story is:\u00a0when you study a poll, make sure you look under the hood for a political agenda\u00a0and flaws on how data is weighed.\u202fLiberal elites are working in concert to defeat President Trump. The media establishment, the political establishment and the academic establishment have gone all-in to take him down \u2014 and the American people see it.Any other leader would have crumbled in the polls long ago but this\u00a0president is an oak with a dedicated movement behind him.Juxtapose the intensity on the Trump side of the ledger with the big questions about Joe Biden\u2019s ability to secure votes in his own right.Can Biden excite enough people to turn out a big vote in 2020?\u202fNo one knows for sure and that\u2019s causing the left a lot of heartburn\u00a0for Democrats.Although he\u2019s currently\u00a0embracing democratic socialists Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, and others on the far-left fringe of the Democratic Party,\u00a0throughout his career Biden has\u00a0taken positions\u00a0on many issues that will demoralize\u00a0this Democratic faction.Biden\u2019s support of crime legislation in 1993 that increased imprisonment of African Americans, his vote in favor of the Iraq war, and his unflinching support for trade agreements that shipped American jobs to China will upset many Democratic voters, once these earlier positions\u00a0become more\u00a0widely known.Over the next three months, Biden will be defined by Trump, just like Bush defined Dukakis in 1988.The American people are going to find out that Biden is a weak puppet of the radical socialist left and is willing to sacrifice the America we know and love in order to get elected.Voters face a clear choice in November. Trump stands for security, prosperity and putting America first. Biden, by definition, stands for the exact opposite and his dangerous policies confirm just that.At the end of the day, the only polling\u00a0that matters\u00a0will be\u00a0the results on Election Day. Just ask all the losing presidential candidates who pollsters told us would become president.", "comment": "(1,832)", "topic": "OPINION", "date": " July 26"}, {"cover": "https://a57.foxnews.com/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/694940094001/54d56f1c-1d75-4146-a6bd-ffc1e378d19c/5a9df840-b7b3-4b58-aeba-502480bbd85b/1280x720/match/156/88/image.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "title": "Pompeo, State Department sharpen criticism of China on virus and rights abuses", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/politics/pompeo-state-department-sharpen-criticism-of-china-on-virus-and-rights-abuses", "subtitle": "Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and his department are stepping up attacks against China over the country's human rights abuses and handling of the coronavirus, barbs that come as observers around the world are outraged at Beijing's treatment of pro-democracy protesters and of Uyghur\u00a0Muslims.\u00a0", "keyword": "presidential election and trade war", "website": "Fox News", "author": "Tyler Olson", "content": " Mike Pompeo and his department are stepping up attacks against  over the country's human rights abuses and handling of the , barbs that come as observers around the world are outraged at Beijing's treatment of pro-democracy protesters and Uyghur\u00a0Muslims.They also come during an election year and as President Trump is struggling to defend his administration's response to the coronavirus pandemic.The attacks are not new, but they represent a sharpened message on China from an administration whose messaging on the nation has run the gamut from harsh condemnation to effusive praise.\u00a0They have ranged from knocks on China for  information about the coronavirus to\u00a0\u00a0directed at American companies about working with Chinese brands due to their use of forced\u00a0labor;\u00a0from\u00a0 about China's actions in Hong Kong to condemnation for  \"the stain of the century\" of human rights violations.There have also been more general attacks, like one ominous Sunday night tweet from the State Department's official account.\"@SecPompeo: We are watching the world unite to come to understand the threat from the Chinese Communist Party,\" it reads.Pompeo, in a recent pair of speeches, has also taken explicit shots at China.\"China, in particular, is aggressively promoting a very different concept in which national priorities of various sorts prevail over the basic rights of speech, assembly, religious freedom, and free elections,\" Pompeo said Thursday at a speech about the State Department's efforts on \"unalienable rights.\"Pompeo made similar comments at the Family Leadership Summit the next day in Iowa.\"And inside China, just to give a single example, a few weeks back I read a report about the Chinese Communist Party forcing mass abortions and sterilization on Chinese Muslims in Western China,\" he said.\u00a0\"These are some of the most gross human rights violations we have seen and I\u2019ve referred to it as the stain of the century.\"He added: \"We\u2019ve called out China\u2019s war on faith. Its mass detention of Uyghurs, its godless decisions to replace church displays of the Ten Commandments with words from General Secretary Xi have not gone without being called out.\"Despite the recent tough talk, the administration has seemed to take a hodgepodge of stances on criticizing China, oftentimes depending on the issue. Trump has railed against China for taking advantage of the United States on trade deals since the 2016 campaign. But\u00a0he's often praised Chinese President Xi Jinping himself.Meanwhile, the U.S. has maintained a consistent message against China's claims in the South China Sea during the Trump administration, regularly executing freedom of navigation operations with U.S. Navy vessels. But Trump himself roiled Republicans last fall when he congratulated Xi on his country's 70th anniversary, refraining from any criticism of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).The Trump administration has sought to stymie the Chinese-controlled tech company Huawei from global 5G networks \u2014\u00a0something it just secured a major victory\u00a0at with the United Kingdom recently deciding to freeze Huawei out of its 5G infrastructure. But Trump, according to a memoir by his former National Security Adviser John Bolton, had indicated he personally didn't care about China's repression of ethnic minorities, specifically the Uyghur Muslims.\"At the opening dinner of the Osaka G20 meeting, with only interpreters present, Xi explained to Trump why he was basically building concentration camps in Xinjiang. According to our interpreter, Trump had said that Xi should go ahead with building the camps, which he thought was exactly the right thing to do,\" Bolton said. \"[Deputy National Security Advisor Matt] Pottinger told me Trump said something very similar during the 2017 trip to China, which meant we could cross repression of Uighurs off our list of possible reasons to sanction China, at least as long as trade negotiations continued.\"Trump and those in his administration have repeatedly condemned Bolton and his book, denying many of the allegations it contains.Now, amid the continuing fallout from the president's handling of the coronavirus pandemic, with Trump angrily deflecting blame for the virus toward China -- where it originated -- Pompeo and the State Department are putting rhetorical pressure on China with\u00a0renewed vigor.\"Countries that want to be global powers, countries that want to participate on the global stage, have a corresponding obligation to comply to the promises they make. China made a promise to the World Health Organization. There's a set of rules about disclosure, and when you have\u00a0 an incident in your country that could potentially lead to a pandemic, you have an obligation to report that and allow others co tome in and helo,\" Pompeo said in a video tweeted last week that was originally on The Hill's \"Virtually Live.\"The United States has withdrawn from the World Health Organization over its alleged compliance with China in covering up the coronavirus in its initial stages.Pompeo added: \"The Chinese Communist Party chose differently, they co-opted the World Health Organization to achieve that coverup, and the result today is that we have hundreds of thousands of people who have died and trillions of dollars in global damage as a direct result.\"Trump got at a similar point in an interview with \"Fox News Sunday.\"\"It came from China. They should've never let it escape. They should've never let it out,\" he said.Trump later continued: \"The World Health got a tremendous amount wrong. They basically did whatever China wanted them to. And we'll save now almost $500 million a year, which is nice. But the World Health got a lot wrong.\"China, meanwhile, has shot back in the diplomatic war of words, accusing the United States of mishandling the coronavirus and even at one point falsely accusing the U.S. Army of introducing the virus into China.\"The #US politicizes #COVID19 response at home and uses 'attacking China'\u00a0as a panacea for domestic problems. A real-life #HouseofCards\u00a0is on in #Washington, with people's lives at stake,\" Hua Chunying, a  for the country's foreign ministry, said in a tweet last week.It's unclear where U.S.-China relations could go from this increasingly hostile juncture, with another grand trade deal, cooperation on North Korea or reconciliation on geopolitical claims in East Asia looking increasingly unlikely. But any kind of military conflict still appears far-fetched, and\u00a0neither nation appears poised to institute new tariffs on the other -- private businesses in both countries continue to work in the other, with American businesses like the NBA still reluctant to even  China's human rights abuses, let alone take any action or make any statements on the matter.For now, tit-for-tat sanctions appear to be as far as either country will go, with Trump this month signing the Hong Kong Autonomy Act, a bill to sanctions Chinese entities that have contributed to eroding the freedoms once enjoyed in Hong Kong and financial institutions that do business with them. The\u00a0executive branch also announced sanctions in relation to the oppression of the Uyghur Muslims.Meanwhile, China\u00a0sanctioned some U.S. individuals, including Republican Sens. Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio. Cruz, a close ally of the administration, echoed the rhetoric from Pompeo in his response.\"Unfortunately for CCP leaders, I don't have plans to travel to the authoritarian regime that covered up the coronavirus pandemic and endangered millions of lives worldwide,\" Cruz said in a statement that also condemned\u00a0the \"horrific forced abortions and sterilizations\" of the Uyghur Muslims.", "comment": "", "topic": "State Department", "date": " July 20"}, {"cover": "https://a57.foxnews.com/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/694940094001/8a06a4f6-f355-48b4-a574-e4edcd278a06/a2fef0c6-5a0d-45da-b366-bb831254d73b/1280x720/match/156/88/image.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "title": "Another incumbent falls", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/politics/another-incumbent-falls", "subtitle": "Trump endorsed, five-term Colorado U.S. Rep.\u00a0Scott Tipton\u00a0lost in Tuesday\u2019s Republican primary.", "keyword": "presidential election and trade war", "website": "Fox News", "author": "Chris Stirewalt", "content": ".:\u00a0\u201cFive-term Colorado U.S. Rep.\u00a0\u00a0was upset in Tuesday\u2019s Republican Party primary by\u00a0, a pistol-packing businesswoman, ardent defender of gun rights and border wall supporter who wants to abolish the U.S. Department of Education.

Thirteen other states, mostly in the South, have not yet expanded Medicaid.

Ford began its development of the Thunderbird in the years following World War II, during which American servicemen had the opportunity to observe sleek European sports cars. General Motors built the first American sports car: the Chevrolet Corvette, released in 1953. The undeniably sleek Corvette\u2019s initial engine performance was relatively underwhelming, but it was gaining lots of attention from the press and public, and Ford was motivated to respond, rushing the Thunderbird to the market in 1955. The 1955 Thunderbird was an immediate hit, selling more than 14,000 that year (compared to just 700 Corvettes). The success of the Thunderbird led Chevrolet to continue production of (and improve upon) the Corvette, which soon became a tough competitor in the sports car market.\u201d\u00a0Email us at\u00a0\u00a0with your tips, comments or questions.NATIONAL HEAD-TO-HEAD AVERAGE39.8 percent50 percentBiden by 10.2 pointsBiden: \u2193 0.8 point; Trump: No change[]BATTLEGROUND POWER RANKINGS(270 electoral votes needed to win)(109 electoral votes): Wisconsin (10), Ohio (18), Florida (29), Arizona (11), Pennsylvania (20), North Carolina (15), Iowa (6)(180 electoral votes)(249 electoral votes)[.]TRUMP JOB PERFORMANCE40 percent55.4 percent: -15.4 points\u2193 1.6 points[]You can join Chris and Brianna every day on Fox Nation.

Initial intelligence was shared with the White House and included in one of [\u2019s] daily briefings in early 2019. In spite of that, Trump has maintained a warm relationship with Russian leader\u00a0\u00a0throughout his presidency. Trump on Wednesday dismissed the allegations as \u2018Fake News.\u2019 The White House initially said Trump wasn\u2019t briefed on the intelligence. But on Tuesday, press secretary\u00a0\u00a0said Trump was indeed briefed, though there were reservations about the veracity of the allegations. \u2018Make no mistake. This president will always protect American troops,\u2019 she declared. Those words rang hollow to some who serve the military community, like Rep.\u00a0, R-Calif., a Marine veteran who represents several military installations and is retiring at year\u2019s end. \u2018I\u2019m not really sure he absorbs a lot of this stuff,\u2019 Cook told The Associated Press of reports that Trump was briefed on the bounties. \u2018He\u2019s probably thinking about the polls.\u2019\u201d\u00a0: \u201cTwo \u2018gang of eight\u2019 members on Tuesday seemed to offer different assessments when asked whether the group \u2014 consisting of the top four congressional leaders and the leaders of the House and Senate Intelligence committees \u2014 were briefed on intelligence that Russia offered bounties to the Taliban to kill U.S. troops. \u2018No,\u2019 House Minority Leader\u00a0, R-Calif., said flatly Tuesday when asked if the group had been briefed on the matter before the New York Times and other outlets reported it this weekend. House Intelligence Chairman\u00a0, however, indicated the group had received some bits of intelligence related to the matter while saying he couldn\u2019t comment on specifics. \u2018I can say that we have been kept informed over time of Russia\u2019s malign activities in Afghanistan,\u2019 the California Democrat said.\u201d: \u201cPresident Trump threatened to veto what is considered a must-pass $740 billion defense spending bill unless it drops a requirement introduced by Sen.\u00a0\u00a0to rename US military bases that honor Confederate leaders. \u2018I will Veto the Defense Authorization Bill if the Elizabeth \u2018Pocahontas\u2019 Warren (of all people!) Amendment, which will lead to the renaming (plus other bad things!) of Fort Bragg, Fort Robert E. Lee, and many other Military Bases from which we won Two World Wars, is in the Bill!\u2019 the president said in a tweet late Tuesday. Meanwhile, acting Department of Homeland Security Secretary\u00a0\u00a0on Wednesday announced the creation of a task force for \u2018protecting our nation\u2019s historic monuments, memorials, statues, and federal facilities.\u2019\u201d: \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s son-in-law,\u00a0, has made a change in the re-election campaign\u2019s top ranks, after the calamitous attempt at an overhyped rally in Tulsa, Okla., resulted in thousands of empty seats, officials said Tuesday night.\u00a0, among the original hires on the Trump campaign in 2015, will be moved from the role of chief operating officer of the 2020 re-election effort. In his place will be\u00a0, who held that role in 2016 and is an ally of Mr. Kushner\u2019s. \u2026\u00a0\u00a0, a campaign spokesman, insisted that the move was \u2018not a reaction to Tulsa,\u2019 saying: \u2018Michael Glassner is moving into the long-term role of navigating the many legal courses we face, including suits against major media outlets, some of which will likely extend beyond the end of the campaign. He is one of the founding members of Team Trump, and his dedication to the success of the president is unmatched.\u2019\u201d: \u201cPresident Trump has told people in recent days that he regrets following some of son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner's political advice \u2014 including supporting criminal justice reform \u2014 and will stick closer to his own instincts, three people with direct knowledge of the president's thinking tell Axios. One person who spoke with the president interpreted his thinking this way: \u2018No more of Jared's woke s***.\u2019 Another said Trump has indicated that following Kushner's advice has harmed him politically. This could be the final straw for federal police reform legislation this year, and it could usher in even more incendiary campaign tactics between now and November. The sources said the president has resolved to stick to his instincts and jettison any policies that go against them, including ambitious police reform.\u201d: \u201c made the short drive from his now-famous basement, jogged into the high school gym where he usually votes and excoriated President Donald Trump as failing miserably to protect the health and safety of Americans. Then, after laying out his own plan to slow the coronavirus, the presumptive Democratic nominee made what now amounts to news in this bizarre election: He opened the floor to questions from reporters, waving off aides when they tried to cut him off and marveling at how strange this has all become. \u2026 It had been nearly three months since he held his last news conference, and that one took place in a choppy virtual setting. In his absence, Biden has faced relentless badgering from the president and his allies, who accused him of hiding out at home and challenged his mental acuity. On Tuesday, Trump\u2019s campaign took credit for smoking out the former vice president. But whatever fire they were hoping would consume him didn\u2019t seem to catch.\u201d: \u201cPresident Donald Trump is falling further behind Democrat Joe Biden in the race for the White House, a new USA TODAY/Suffolk Poll finds \u2013 but the president's real opponent seems to be himself. Opposition to Trump is by far the biggest factor propelling support for Biden, including among those who are lukewarm to the presumptive Democratic nominee. Biden leads Trump by 12 percentage points, 53%-41%, the nationwide survey shows. In a three-way ballot test, including a third-party line, Biden leads the Republican incumbent 46%-37%. Trump continues to hold a significant edge when it comes to enthusiasm among his supporters, an important factor in turning out voters. Half of Trump backers say they are \u2018very excited\u2019 about their candidate, almost double the 27% of Biden backers who say that. \u2026 By a narrow 45%-41%, those surveyed predict Biden will defeat Trump in November.\u201d:\u00a0\u201cThe Senate passed a surprise extension for the Paycheck Protection Program to August 8 by unanimous consent Tuesday night, just hours before it was set to close down. The legislation would extend the deadline for when the PPP can accept applications for forgivable loans. The bill gives the Small Business Administration the authority to continue approving loans to businesses that apply. However, the House of Representatives will need to pass the legislation, and send it to President Donald Trump for his signature to keep the money flowing. Both chambers of Congress are set to adjourn for recess by the week\u2019s conclusion.\u201d\u00a0: \u201cA conservative nonprofit group allied with the leading outside super PAC backing President Trump\u2019s reelection is launching a $4 million ad blitz starting this holiday weekend to urge Congress to work with the president to pass policies that will help the nation\u2019s economy recover after being flattened by the coronavirus pandemic. \u2018America\u2019s beginning to open up, getting back on track and, working together, America always fights back. Now America needs Congress to work with President Trump, to cut payroll taxes for American workers, bring back jobs from overseas with tax incentives, and make better trade deals to bring the economy roaring back,\u2019 says the narrator in the spot by America First Policies.\u201d: \u201cSenate Republicans are beginning to put together their own fifth COVID-19 aid package, but with no apparent Democratic involvement it\u2019s unlikely to receive enough support to pass both chambers. \u2018What I can tell you without fear of contradiction is the focus will be kids, jobs and health care,\u2019 Senate Majority Leader\u00a0\u00a0said Tuesday after a closed-door lunch with GOP senators. \u2018What I can tell you without fear of contradiction is that any bill that passes the Senate will have liability protections in it.\u2019 One section of that package is already being drafted, according to Labor-HHS-Education Appropriations Subcommittee Chairman\u00a0. The Missouri Republican told reporters that he\u2019s directed the panel to begin working on legislation that would provide funding for more testing, additional work on therapeutics and vaccine research.\u201d\u00a0-\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m often reminded that I\u2019m a sinner too, and I fall short in so many ways. I think it\u2019s been helpful to just remember that most people come to the table with good intentions. We all come to the table with very different experiences. And if I\u2019m willing to hear their experience and understand their position, then instinctively I\u2019ll get to a better conclusion.\u201d \u2013\u00a0\u201cI was talking with my girlfriend, who votes but does not stay current with the daily circus, about the presidential race. I showed her your Battlegound Power Rankings, described how Biden is clearly ahead, and how the election will come down to the toss ups. She asked me, \u2018If Biden is that far ahead, Trump pretty much has no chance, right?\u2019 I paused for a minute and said, \u2018Think of a baseball game that is 6-2 in the 3rd or 4th inning. Sure, the team that\u2019s ahead will likely win. But the rest of the game is still worth playing, because anything could happen.\u2019 Since then I\u2019ve been thinking about how true that analogy is (or isn\u2019t). I\u2019m wondering, if you had to compare it to a baseball game, what inning would it be? What would the score be? Thanks so much for writing the Report everyday. Makes understanding the news much easier and relatable. Love the quotes from Mr. Krauthammer, too.\u201d \u2013\u00a0[]\u201cWhat changes does Trump need to make to his message to make inroads with swing voters?\u201d \u2013\u00a0[]\u201cAs you know, I am a faithful reader. In this epoch of destruction, chaos and potential expropriation, are we seeing the Beginning of the End of the \u2018Grand Experiment?\u2019 As humans, are we too small and mean to know that by serving our best interests, we are serving the best interests of us all.

On the morning of Monday, June 29, customers filed into Canadian Tire stores in Lindsay and Whitby as usual, filling baskets as they browsed through the aisles. However, upon getting to a point of sale, people quickly realized that there was something completely bizarre happening. Cash register attendants were left bewildered after every single item they scanned came up reading \u2018Mr. Potato Head.\u2019 No matter what staff tried, the glitch couldn't be corrected, and workers were eventually forced to temporarily close their stores. \u2018This was an anomaly that occurred only at our Lindsay and Whitby stores,\u2019 explained Canadian Tire rep\u00a0, speaking to Kawartha 411 News. The company attributed the unappeeling issue to a downloading error, which caused item names to instead appear the same as the popular children's toy.\u201d\u201cIn my view, two truths must guide any decision: (1) The parents must be sovereign, but (2) the parents are sometimes wrong.\u201d \u2013\u00a0.", "comment": "(58)", "topic": "Politics", "date": " July 1"}, {"cover": "https://a57.foxnews.com/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/694940094001/992ea599-6d2d-4029-a700-8116c1c74597/5d3730dc-a664-4106-9813-847a62a2c67b/1280x720/match/156/88/image.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "title": "Tale of the tape: State of Trump 2016 campaign promises", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/transcript/tale-of-the-tape-state-of-trump-2016-campaign-promises", "subtitle": "Jul 28, 2020 ...

I'm Shannon Bream in for Bret Baier. President Trump has just concluded a news conference from the White House. He says large portions of the country are corona-free. The president adds, cases in hot zones are heading down. But the briefing was not all about coronavirus. Chief White House correspondent John Roberts was at today's session and starts us off tonight. Good evening, John. JOHN ROBERTS, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Shannon, good evening to you. Some of the biggest news out of the White House today is the fact that the Department of Homeland Security is going to undertake a thorough review of the so-called DACA program, the dreamers' Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals to determine whether that program should continue and if it shouldn't continue, how to wind it down. In the meantime, the Department of Homeland Security will not be taking any new initial applications for new DACA recipients. The renewal for the DACA program will be done on a case by case basis. And the period of renewal would be reduced from two years to one year. And unless it's extraordinary circumstances, current DACA recipients will not be able to leave the country. Now, when the president first heard about the Supreme Court decision regarding DACA, he suggested that he was going to implement a fix that may include a path to citizenship for current DACA recipients. I asked him about that at the briefing a short time ago. Listen here. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We are going to make DACA happy in the DACA people and representatives happy and we're also going to end up with a fantastic merit-based immigration system. (END VIDEO CLIP) ROBERTS: One of the other big topics of course at the briefing this afternoon, hydroxychloroquine back in the news again after the president late last night retweeted a tweet that was critical of Dr. Anthony Fauci claiming that he had misled the nation about the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine. This tweet suggesting that it was more effective than what the National Institutes of Health, other research organizations and Dr. Fauci had been saying about it. Dr. Fauci responding this morning on \"Good Morning America\". Listen here. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH: I just will continue to do my job no matter what comes out because I think it's very important. We're in the middle of a crisis with regard to an epidemic a pandemic. This is what I do, this is what I've been trained for my entire professional life and I'll continue to do it. (END VIDEO CLIP) ROBERTS: That briefing this afternoon, President Trump again saying it is possible that hydroxychloroquine combined with zinc and azithromycin may be an early particularly -- or maybe an effective early stage treatment for coronavirus. The president also lamenting why a recent A.P. poll showed that Anthony Fauci had much higher personal ratings than the president did. Listen to his response here. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: He's got this high approval rating, so why don't I have a high approval rating with respect and the administration with respect to the virus? We should have a very high -- (END VIDEO CLIP) ROBERTS: And the new phase for Coronavirus Relief Bill, the HEALS Act, of course, a big topic of discussion here in Washington today as the Senate Republicans roll out their program. President Trump said there are things about it he likes, there are some things about it -- about it he does not like but it's certain that Democrats do not like the provision on unemployment insurance which reduces the plus up which is currently at $600 a week down to $200 a week. Listen to what the Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said about it earlier this afternoon. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY): People can't feed their kids. People are losing their homes, they get kicked out from their apartments, small business going under. And the Republican response let them eat cake. (END VIDEO CLIP) ROBERTS: Negotiations are under way on Capitol Hill. The White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, the Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin meeting with Nancy Pelosi during the day today. It's going to be a tough lift though, Shannon, because they seem to be so far apart in terms of money and how that money is divvied up. I think it would be a miracle if they can get something done before some of this runs out. They may have to do it piecemeal because of course, that unemployment insurance which runs out at the end of this month, that's something's got to be done about that or there's going to be a lot of people who don't have any money to buy anything, Shannon. BREAM: Yes, both sides seem to be suggesting there's not a ton of progress as you said today. John Roberts at the White House. Thank you, John. ROBERTS: You bet. BREAM: Attorney General William Barr says violent rioters and anarchists have hijacked legitimate protests to wreak senseless havoc and destruction on innocent victims. Barr mounted a vigorous defense of the administration's response and his relationship with the president before an often-hostile House Judiciary Committee today. Correspondent Gillian Turner shows us what happened. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Mr. Barr, if I may -- WILLIAM BARR, U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL: Yes, but this is a hearing, I thought I was the one that's supposed to be heard. GILLIAN TURNER, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT: The attorney general struggled at times to defend his record amid the Democrat majority's relentless interrogating. But his main message was loud and clear, when it comes to delivering justice, he insists he's never done President Trump's bidding. BARR: He has told me from the start that he expects me to exercise my independent judgment to make whatever call I think is right and that is precisely what I've done. TURNER: House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler delayed by a traffic accident enroute to the hearing set the tone for Democrats attacks in his opening line. REP. JERRY NADLER (D-NY): You have aided and abetted the worst failings of the president. This administration has twisted the Department of Justice into a shadow of its former self. TURNER: But Barr insisted he's only ever sought equal justice for the administration. BARR: I agree the president's friends don't deserve special breaks but they also don't deserve to be treated more harshly than other people. TURNER: Republican Jim Jordan slammed Democrats saying for them, it's always been about the Russia hoax and always will be. REP. JIM JORDAN (R-OH): Spying, that one word. That's why they're after you Mr. Attorney General. They've been attacking you ever since, every day, every week for simply stating the truth that the Obama-Biden administration spied on the Trump campaign. TURNER: Talking about protests for racial justice, Barr put a partisan spin on violence in American cities. BARR: The Democratic Party are not coming out and condemning mob violence and the attack on federal courts. Could we hear something like that? TURNER: He also singled out Antifa for fomenting violence. BARR: We are concerned about this problem metastasizing around the country. TURNER: As for the demonstrations in front of the White House last month when officers forcefully removed protesters from Lafayette Square, Barr defended his actions denying it was done to give Trump a photo op at a nearby church. BARR: To say that this had to do with a photo op but it's akin to saying that we invaded the Philippines in World War II, so Douglas MacArthur could walk through the surf on the beach. (END VIDEOTAPE) TURNER: Looking ahead to the November election, Barr says he assumed Russia is trying to interfere. He differs from President Trump who has said he believes 2020 will be rigged by increased mail in voting. Barr said today, he's got no reason to think that's the case, Shannon. BREAM: All right, we'll break it down with the panel coming up. Gillian Turner on Capitol Hill, thank you. A declassified report from the Senate Intelligence Committee is revealing internal conversations about the Steele dossier between the FBI and CIA during the writing of an Intelligence Community assessment on Russian election interference, a potential collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. The report reinforces the deep divide regarding how much stock the Intelligence Community put into this deal information well before the three renewals of the Carter Page FISA warrants. The head of the U.S. Park Police is denying that his officers turned violently on protesters and journalists during that Lafayette Square confrontation mentioned in our last report. Gregory Monahan told a House Committee today, there was zero correlation between the abrupt clearing of the area and President Trump's surprise appearance shortly after. Well tonight, we get the inside story on defending a federal building under attack. National correspondent William La Jeunesse shows us how federal officers are trying to protect government property and themselves in Portland. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) WILLIAM LA JEUNESSE, FOX NEWS CHANNEL NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Another night of protests outside the federal courthouse in Portland as officers inside gave a final warning. Federal agents opened the courthouse doors facing a barrage of bottles and fireworks. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: By no means is this a peaceful protest. It starts to knock the night off like that. But eventually it's taken over by what we're -- you know, their violent opportunists who are using this peaceful protest to take over. LA JEUNESSE: After weeks of media coverage focusing on the protesters, Fox was given a behind the scenes look at the federal agents who are defending the building. Protesters called the agents' actions unnecessary excessive and dangerous. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: if I exhale hard enough, you could see, like, a cloud of smoke come out of it. LA JEUNESSE: In recent days, federal agents have seized Molotov cocktails, bats, hockey sticks, slingshots, cans and garden sprayers filled with bleach and urine. BARR: We are on the defense. It's -- we're not out looking for trouble. And if the state and the city would provide the law enforcement services and other jurisdictions, still, we would have no need to have additional marshals in the courthouse. LA JEUNESSE: Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler for weeks criticized the feds as a paramilitary force attacking democracy. But Monday, he called for an immediate meeting with acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf to consider a ceasefire. U.S. Marshal Russell Berger who commands officers on the ground prefers cooperation to confrontation. RUSSELL BERGER, U.S. MARSHAL: I think that anytime leaders get together and try to find solutions, that's a good thing. (END VIDEOTAPE) LA JEUNESSE: While there are encouraging signs coming out of the local NAACP, the U.S. attorney's office and city hall, there's no reason to believe that what we saw last night won't happen again tonight, Shannon. BREAM: We will be watching. William, thank you. So, let's get reaction to all of this from House Judiciary Committee ranking member Jim Jordan of Ohio. Congressman, good to see you. JORDAN: Good to be with you, Shannon. BREAM: All right, you got a lot of attention in this hearing today for a mash up, a video that you ran showing some of the riots around the country, some of the protests that have turned violent. JORDAN: Yes. BREAM: Here's how NBC reports on it. It says, the video that you played omitted images of federal law enforcement officers and members of the military taking aggressive action against protesters. Democrats said you didn't clear the video in advance as you should have. How do you defend that tonight? JORDAN: Well, Democrats want to censor Republican members of the Judiciary Committee just like the hard left wants to censor conservatives around the country. I mean, the video speaks for itself. You have -- you had two reporters in that video saying these are -- these are peaceful protests while there's a building burning in the background for goodness sake. So, we just presented the truth. We wanted to make sure the American people saw what is really happening in these cities. Portland has been under siege. The federal building in Portland as Bill Barr testified today, under siege for almost nine weeks, 61 straight days. And Bill Barr did a great job today. He's doing a great job as attorney general but he asked a fundamental question, why won't the Democrats condemn the mob? Why won't they condemn the rioters? Why won't they condemn what's happening to the federal building in Portland? And when we ask him would that federal building be standing today but for federal officers defending it, he said, no it would not. Would St. John Church be standing today but for actions by the federal government? No, it would not. That's the fundamental issue that Americans see it. The ones who don't are Democrat leaders in Congress and Democrat mayors around the country. BREAM: Well, the House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler had a lot to say today to you and to the attorney general. And he said the president is leveraging these images to try to help himself get reelected and accused the attorney general of doing the dirty work for him. Here's a bit of their exchange. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) NADLER: You used pepper spray and truncheons on American citizens. You did it here in Washington. You did it Lafayette Square. You expanded to Portland and now you are projecting fear and violence nationwide in pursuit of obvious political objectives, shame on you Mr. Barr. (END VIDEO CLIP) BREAM: What did you make of the newest accusations that came from Democrats who said just not on this issue but on several? The attorney general has covered for and protected the president in a way that they find unlawful. JORDAN: The attorney general is enforcing the rule of law. And if Democrats want to try to blame the attorney general for what is happening in Democrat-run cities that have been Democrat-run for years and years, I think the last time there was an elected Republican in Portland was 1956. They want to try to blame the administration for that, they're just flat out wrong. How about the -- how about the police chief in Seattle who sent a letter to the residents and the business owners in Seattle and said, the City Council just passed something that doesn't allow our officers to protect you from violent crowds. I'm putting you on notice. We will have to do a quote, adjusted deployment, which was a nice way of telling those business owners and residents, we're not going to be there. We would love to be -- Carmen Best, the police chief, she was doing what you're supposed to as a leader. She was -- she was trying to serve the constituents, serve her -- the people in her city. But she had to tell them, look, they're tying our hands. I would like to help you but the Democrat controlled nine -- excuse me, eight Democrats and one socialist on the Seattle City Council are making it tough for us to do our job, we're warning you. That's what Bill Barr is criticizing. That's what's wrong. And all we -- all we did is point out what is happening in so many of our major -- in the United States of America. This kind of stuff is going on. That is -- this idea -- and Bill Barr talked about this, this idea of defunding the police, it is dangerous. And he said that, we showed that, that's what the focus of this hearing was about. That's what he said -- that's what needs to be cleaned up. BREAM: Well, and quickly, we showed the clip a little bit earlier when he said this is a hearing, I thought I was supposed to be here to be heard. But what any neutral observer could see when they watched today is that Democrats would ask questions and when he would began explaining beyond a yes or no answer, they immediately would say I reclaim my time. Meaning, the member is the only one who could speak, then the attorney general couldn't. Do you think this hearing was beneficial today and why do you think he decided to walk into that situation knowing it would probably go that way? JORDAN: No, I mean, look, he did a great job in spite of the fact they tried to -- try to not even let him speak. I mean, you think about this hearing, the Democrats cut off or they wouldn't show our whole video. The Democrats wouldn't let the attorney general answer questions and then they tried to stop him from taking a restroom break for goodness sake. That's the treatment the Democrats give the attorney general of the United States. It is -- it is wrong. American people saw it for what it was. They appreciate the work I think -- I think the vast majority of the people in this country appreciate the work that President Trump is doing, appreciate the work that the attorney general is doing. And we just tried to underscore that and show that to them today. BREAM: Congressman Jim Jordan ranking member on House Judiciary. We're going to dig in this -- into this with the panel. I'm sure they will have a lot to say about it. Thank you for your time sir. JORDAN: You bet, Shannon. Thank you. BREAM: OK, up next, the lengths some parents are going to make sure their kids get an in-person education. First, here's what some of our Fox affiliates around the country are covering tonight. FOX 28 in Columbus as Republican state representatives in Ohio meet for the first time since their leader was arrested in connection with a $60 million federal bribery probe. They're discussing whether to remove House Speaker Larry Householder and what the investigation's fallout might mean for their fall legislative campaigns. FOX 5 in New York as ridesharing scooters startup Revel says it's suspending operations in the city after a second fatal crash in less than two weeks. Revel says it is reviewing safety and rider accountability measures. And this is a live look at San Diego from FOX 5. The big story there tonight, test samples reveal toxic chemicals in the smoke from the fire aboard the USS Bonhomme Richard, despite the Navy's claim that the smoke was not toxic. The San Diego County Air Pollution Control District says, toxic chemicals were found but not at levels that would cause any health concerns. That is tonight's live look outside the Beltway from SPECIAL REPORT. We'll be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BREAM: The CDC is reporting nearly 55,000 new cases of coronavirus Monday. That brings the total in the U.S. to more than 4.3 million with almost 150,000 deaths. Major League Baseball has postponed games for the Miami Marlins until at least next week. The number of infections on the team now stands at, at least, 15. Dr. Anthony Fauci says the outbreak could threaten the season. And Airline Industry Trade Association says it's going to take until 2024 to return to pre-pandemic levels. That is a one-year extension of the previous prediction. The nation's second largest teacher's union says it will support members who go on strike because of unsafe working conditions due to the pandemic. And more districts are going virtual. Students in Philadelphia and Columbus, Ohio learned today they will start the new semester online. As more and more schools make plans for virtual education to start the coming school year, some parents are trying to make sure their kids get in- person instruction. Correspondent Laura Ingle shows us how tonight from Malvern, New York. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ELIZABETH BERGMAN, PARENT: In 2020, we are all looking to pivot. This was an idea that just came to us to continue the path of education and in person instruction for our children. LAURA INGLE, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT: The idea set up their own small group or pod of students to continue lessons outside the regular school setting. It's a trend around the country as parents face uncertainty about whether schools will open in the fall. They're hiring teachers to hold many classes outside or at one another's homes. Parents say it's been beneficial. BERGMAN: They picked right back up especially at the younger ages. They thrive on routine and on this classroom setting. INGLE: A recent Fox poll shows two-thirds of those surveyed want children to attend public schools in person this fall to some extent, while 25 percent would prefer to be fully remote. Another tool parents are using to ensure kids don't fall behind is supplemental online classes. ANDREA TOCH, PARENT: We want them engaged and with no arts and no music and no recess. This is a really good way to kind of still that time doing things they love. INGLE: The U.S. Department of Education is warning parents and schools to be prepared for whatever fall brings. FRANK BROGAN, ASSISTANT SECRETARY, EDUCATION DEPARTMENT: Don't develop one plan, develop multiple plans because you're going to be surprised to find out nothing is going to work for a one size fits all approach to this thing. (END VIDEOTAPE) INGLE: The money to fund private pot instruction learning space and child care are all major issues that some parents say will not come easy as they try to manage their own jobs to keep their families afloat, Shannon. BREAM: Laura, thank you. Well, stocks were down today. The Dow lost 205. The S&P 500 fell 21. NASDAQ gave back 134. The House Judiciary Committee will hold a hearing tomorrow on the domination of Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google. Many of the industry's top leaders are expected to testify including Jeff Bezos of Amazon and Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook. The hearing was postponed last week after the death of Congressman John Lewis. Well, up next, Joe Biden tells us when he will be announcing his vice presidential candidate. First, Beyond Our Borders tonight. North Korean leader Kim Jong-un says his country's hard-won nuclear weapons are a solid security guarantee. State media report, Kim told Korean War veterans, the weapons are a reliable and effective deterrence that could prevent a second Korean War. Two bases in the Middle East housing U.S. troops and aircraft went on high alert when Iranian missiles appeared to be headed for them. The U.S. Central Command says American service members at bases in the United Arab Emirates and in Qatar were told to quickly find shelter when several missiles were fired from Iran. Ultimately, the missiles landed well shorts and out to sea. The launches were part of an Iranian military exercise in the Persian Gulf. Preparations conclude for a very different observance of a major Muslim holiday at the Grand Mosque in Mecca. It would normally be packed with more than two million pilgrims, but only a thousand to 10,000 are being allowed to come this year because of the coronavirus. To some of the other stories Beyond Our Borders tonight. We'll be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BREAM: In tonight's Democracy 2020 segment, Joe Biden sets the timetable for announcing his pick for a running mate. He also unveiled the latest package of promises should he be elected in November. Correspondent Doug McKelway shows us what the Democrat is proposing and who's helping him get into a position to deliver. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I'm going to have a choice in the first week in August, and I promise I'll let you know when I do. DOUG MCKELWAY, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT: Back on the trail, but sticking close to home at an inner-city Community Center in Wilmington, Joe Biden said he will reveal his running mate next week. The announcement came as the former V.P. unveiled the fourth and final plan of his Build Back Better economic recovery plan today. BIDEN: It's about rising in this moment of crisis. Understanding people's struggles and building a future worthy of their courage and their ambition to overcome. MCKELWAY: It's a 26-page of wish lists covering anything from helping black and brown farmers purchase land, to providing $150 billion in new capital for small businesses who've been, quote, structurally excluded for generations. How to pay for it? It's doubtful any Republican Congress would agree, Biden's counting on Democrats taking control. BIDEN: If I'm elected and this passes, I'm going to be good to go down as one of the most progressive presidents in American history. MCKELWAY: He accused President Trump's remedies of favoring the rich. Right now we're in the midst of one of the greatest threats to small businesses our country has ever seen. What's Donald Trump doing about it? He's giving big banks the green light to loan millions of dollars. MCKELWAY: That comment omitted the lowest black unemployment rate in history before the virus hit. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I support him 100 percent. MCKELWAY: The Biden campaign also held separate events with Native Americans, another with African-American Virginia Congressman Bobby Scott, and a virtual meeting with President Obama and George Clooney. (END VIDEOTAPE) MCKELWAY: The virus is defining two very different agendas when it comes to rebuilding the economy. Biden is based upon an expansion of government aid and regulations. Trump's is based upon freeing up businesses from such regulations. Shannon? BREAM: Doug McKelway in Delaware. Thank you, Doug. Now for an examination of what then candidate Donald Trump promised in 2016 and how that's turned out. Correspondent Kristin Fisher takes a look from the White House today. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KRISTIN FISHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Before the pandemic put a stop to the president's rallies, he often delivered remarks in between banners that read \"Promises Made\" and \"Promises Kept.\" Without question, the most successful and perhaps consequential promise that he kept from the 2016 campaign has been to fill the judiciary with conservatives. DONALD TRUMP, (R) PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: The justices that I'm going to appoint will be pro-life. They will have a conservative bent. FISHER: In addition to Supreme Court justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, the Senate has confirmed 198 other judicial appointments, a record for a first term president. Another promise kept, renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement and replacing it with the USMCA. TRUMP: Today we're finally ending the NAFTA nightmare. FISHER: But the president struggled to secure a trade deal with China. He also didn't secure quite as many tax cuts as he promised, but he came close with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. And then there is his signature campaign issue from 2016. TRUMP: We will build that great wall, and Mexico will pay for that great wall. FISHER: Last month the president celebrated the completion of 200 miles of border wall, but Mexico did not pay for it. TRUMP: We're going to rebuild our infrastructure. FISHER: But three-and-a-half years in, the president has yet to put forward an infrastructure plan, though the White House says he may announce one soon. Another promise broken, repealing the Affordable Care Act. TRUMP: We will do it, and we will do it very, very quickly. (END VIDEOTAPE) FISHER: But President Trump is still trying to keep that promise. Just last month his administration asked the Supreme Court to overturn Obamacare, but the justices have decided that they will not hear those arguments until after the election. Shannon? BREAM: Kristin Fisher from the White House, thank you. The attorney for the Kentucky high school student who was involved in a confrontation with a Native American in Washington last year says CNN's chief media correspondent breached his company's settlement agreement with the teenager. Attorney Lin Wood says a retweet from Brian Stelter about how much money Nicholas Sandmann may have been awarded from \"The Washington Post\" in a settlement of that lawsuit may cost him his job. CNN is not commenting. Attorney General William Barr gets into it with Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee about a number of issues. Reaction from the panel when we come back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. HAKEEM JEFFRIES, (D-NY) HOUSE BUDGET COMMITTEE: The job of the White House Counsel is to be the president's lawyer. The job of the attorney general is to be the people's lawyer. And it's not clear that William Barr understands that distinction. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: In your office, you are then free to act independently of the president. Isn't that true? WILLIAM BARR, U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL: That is true. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And that's exactly what he has asked you to do, isn't that right? BARR: Yes. REP. JIM JORDAN, (R-OH) HOUSE OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE: The attorney general is enforcing the rule of law. And if the Democrats want to blame the attorney general for what is happening in Democrat-run cities that have been Democrat-run for years and years, I think the last time there was an elected Republican in Portland was 1956 -- if they want to blame the administration for that, they're just flat out wrong. (END VIDEO CLIP) BREAM: Let's bring in our panel, Byron York, chief political correspondent for the \"Washington Examiner,\" Mara Liasson, national political correspondent for National Public Radio, and \"Washington Post\" columnist Marc Thiessen. Great to see all of you. I trust that you had a chance to watch a good chunk of these hearings today, so I want to get an initial reaction from you. Let's start with you, Marc. MARC THIESSEN, AMERICAN ENTERPRISE INSTITUTE: It was a disgrace. First of all, the American people learned a new phrase, which is \"I'm reclaiming my time,\" which is government for please shut up. I'm going to try that with my kids one day because it's a nicer way to say it, I guess. It was a disgrace. What the American people saw was Democrats relentlessly attacking the character and the credibility of the attorney general while he sat there and tried to answer, and they would cut him off and stop him from answering. You quoted one of the congressmen saying he doesn't -- questioning his credibility. How would he know? He didn't let him answer a question. They didn't even give him a lunch break. It was just awful. But the truth is that we did learn some things, and it was useful for him to sit through that because the chairman of that committee said just the other day that what's happening in Portland is at mid spread in Washington, and at a bare minimum the American people saw a video of what was happening in Portland actually happening, and they saw the attorney general describing how they're using sling shots with ball bearings that have injured officers to the bone, using kerosene filled balloons to set fires to draw them outside so that they can attack them. This is an outrage, and the American people need to see and hear from their government what's happening. BREAM: And Mara, the chairman of the committee, we talked about earlier, Jerry Nadler, he said that this is all happening, this federal action and activity in places like Portland federal courthouse -- he says that it is all sort of a smoke screen so the images will be out there. Here is a bit of his exchange back and forth with the attorney general on the topic. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. JERROLD NADLER, (D-NY) HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN: The president wants footage for his campaign ads, and you appear to be serving it up to him as ordered. The protesters aren't mobs. They are mothers and veterans and mayors. WILLIAM BARR, U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL: Federal courts are under attack. Since when is it OK to try to burn down a federal court? Is that OK now? No. The U.S. Marshals have a duty to stop that and defend the courthouse, and that's what we are doing in Portland. We're not out looking for trouble. (END VIDEO CLIP) BREAM: Mara, there certainly are some mothers and some veterans and some mayors out there, but, Mara, there are people who, you could say, hijacking the underlying peaceful protests and turning them into something much different at the end of each night, especially now 60 plus nights in Portland. MARA LIASSON, NATIONAL POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, NATIONAL PUBLIC RADIO: \u00a0Right. And the Democrats' argument is that but for the extra federal presence, police presence in Portland, the peaceful demonstrations would not have escalated, and that the feds are kind of inciting some of this violence by being there. From the point of view of Barr, and I thought he laid out his case extremely forcefully, is that a federal building is under attack. So you've got this extremely polarized view. It's the same thing with the view of the Justice Department itself. From the Democrats' point of view Barr is doing favors for Trump and Trump's friends. From Barr's point of view the Justice Department became weaponized against Donald Trump. So I would say this was kind of Washington at its most polarized. BREAM: Yes, I think people on both sides ended up very frustrated. Towards the end the attorney general just chuckling and throwing up his hands, Byron. He at one point realized this whole \"I reclaim my time\" means you're not going to answer the question. But we heard something today, too, that we've heard a lot about in recent weeks, that if President Trump is not reelected he may not leave the White House, that all these federal agents on the street are a test run, a trial run for martial law so that he can swoop in and hang on to control of the White House. Here is a little bit more of the conversation today about the 2020 election and what role the attorney general would play if it got ugly. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. CEDRIC RICHMOND, (D-LA) HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE: As attorney general attorney general of the United States do you believe that this 2020 presidential election will be rigged? WILLIAM BARR, U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL: I have no reason to think it will be. RICHMOND Do you believe as the attorney general of the United States that mail-in voting will lead to massive voter fraud? BARR: I think there is a high risk that it will. (END VIDEO CLIP) BREAM: Byron, what do you make about this ongoing theme, this thread that we're hearing played out over the last couple of weeks and today as well about the 2020 election and the president being unable to let go or refuse to leave if he doesn't win? BRYON YORK, CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, \"WASHINGTON EXAMINER\": This has been a Democratic talking point in recent days. It was a Democratic talking point in 2016, by the way, when Donald Trump was a private citizen running for president, there was talk about him somehow not accepting the results had he lost. But he won. But we're hearing a lot about this. And the issue is that the parties seem to have just divided over this issue of voting by mail, and Attorney General Barr was really pretty skeptical about that and believed that it does have the potential for fraud. And also a bigger thing -- even if there were absolutely zero fraud, we've got a few congressional elections in New York that are still undecided because they have been having massive problems with counting and seeing which mail-in ballots are legitimate. This is an enormous problem, and these are in congressional districts in New York state. Put that in a national context, in a presidential election where there's far, far more voting by mail than there ever has been before, and there could be enormous problems. We might not find out who actually won for weeks afterwards. Meanwhile, there is just terrible partisan wrangling going on ala Bush v Gore. So there are some really bad scenarios for voting by mail, and the attorney general simply recognized some of those. BREAM: When you say weeks, Byron, I think we all might have to stock up on the antacids if it comes to that. But we'll all be in it together as we cover it and it falls out. Panel, thank you. Stick around. President Trump next up takes on Dr. Fauci and gets defensive over the coronavirus. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES: \u00a0I don't tweet. I don't even read them, so I don't really want to go there. I just will continue to do my job no matter what comes out because I think it's very important. I have not been misleading the American public under any circumstances. DONALD TRUMP, (R) PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: He's working with our administration, and for the most part we've done pretty much what he and others, Dr. Birx and others, who are terrific, recommended. He's got this high approval ratings. They're highly thought of, but nobody likes me. It can only be my personality. That's all. (END VIDEO CLIP) BREAM: Well, a little bit of levity from the president there today. We're back with our panel, and Mara, I want to start with you. There has been so much about trying to pit Dr. Fauci against President Trump, and yet when confronted face-to-face they each will say we get along fine. We discuss things. We meet. Everything is great. I think so much of him and it's wonderful. And yet there is this constant attempt at driving a wedge between the two. What do you make of it? LIASSON: Yes, I think that it's in neither of their interests to have a wedge driven between the two of them. Dr. Fauci is the good housekeeping seal of approval on this pandemic, and he has been all along. There have been times when the president was more interested in opening the economy, that he wasn't meeting with Fauci enough, as much as he had been, or he wasn't having him to the briefings. But what I don't understand, and it's mystifying to me, is why does President Trump continue to retweet disparaging comments about Dr. Fauci? That I just don't understand. I don't think it's in his interests to undermine the credibility of Dr. Fauci. BREAM: They seem to have a very complex relationship, those two. Meanwhile, they're talking about, on Capitol Hill, putting together more relief funding. There's a fight over these plus-up for unemployment benefits. Today the two sides don't seem much closer together. Byron, here is what former senator Phil Gramm, who is known for crunching the numbers, here is what he had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. PHIL GRAMM, (R-TX) FORMER SENATE BANKING COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN: We've spent a massive amount of money, and the bill has yet to really come due. I believe that we would be blessed if we didn't see another bill pass here and we simply went back and reprogrammed some of the $1.2 trillion. (END VIDEO CLIP) BREAM: OK, Byron, so no bill better than another big deal, what do you think? YORK: Well, that's Phil Gramm's view, and certainly people who need more unemployment aid would certainly disagree with that. On the other hand, when the two sides are trillions of dollars apart, that's a real problem. And Republicans are not united on this. I want to say one thing, though, about this news conference. The president did announce, began by announcing a $765 million loan to Kodak, the photography company, to start making pharmaceuticals, actually the building blocks of generic drugs, in part to address our scandalous reliance on China. I think in the last year or two, because of the trade negotiations people learned how dependent the United States is on China for pharmaceuticals -- 97 percent of our antibiotics come from China. And so any move to try to improve that, and the president started his news conference off by announcing that, would be a good thing. BREAM: The president was pressed today, too, on what his plans are for the RNC, what he'll do, where he is going to deliver his acceptance speech. He used one of these conferences last week to say that it wasn't going to play out the way we've seen conventions play out in the past with the big events in Florida. And now tonight we are just getting word that there are more than 100 police agencies who say they are not going to enter into or live up to these agreements with the DNC because they have now been told the local directives there are that they cannot use pepper spray or teargas or other crowd control things that they've used in the past. So now more than 100 of these police agencies saying they're not going to send agents in or officers in to assist with this. They don't think they can do so safely. Marc? THIESSEN: They might as well move it to Chicago and repeat 1968. Exactly, this is what happens when you defund the police. The police don't come. And so I'm not surprised that police agencies are upset and are saying they're not going to support the conventions. We don't know how these conventions are going to play out, still. We don't know what Trump is going to do because we don't how the pandemic is doing. And when he announced that he was going to move it to Jacksonville, Florida looked like it was doing great. Then all of a sudden Florida wasn't doing so great. So he was smart today to keep his powder dry and say we'll let you know soon what the plan is for my convention speech. BREAM: Mara, do you think the DNC can proceed if they've lost 100 plus law enforcement agencies who were planning to help them manage it? We have all been to conventions, you know, even though these are probably going to be scaled down, it is a logistical and security -- very tight puzzle that's got to work exactly right because of all the people that are there, and high profile, to protect. LIASSON: What I'm really unclear on is how many high-profile people will be there. The DNC has been scaling back, scaling back, a couple hundred people, we know that Joe Biden was planning to accept the nomination in Milwaukee. But I'm wondering what are the protesters going to be protesting if this thing is almost completely virtual? So that is unclear to me. But the fact that these conventions are supposed to start on August 17th for the Democrats and August 24th for the Republicans, that's not very far away. And they still don't know exactly what they're going to be like. THIESSEN: There's only a few hundred people at the courthouse in Portland. BREAM: All right, last 15 second to you, Byron. Yes, that's true. Byron? YORK: My favorite moment of the news -- yes. President Trump today is asked you're going to accept the nomination on Thursday night of the convention week. Where are you physically going to be? And he says we'll be announcing that soon. Anybody have any ideas? That's the way it's going. BREAM: That is what he said. We're standing by for all of that and more. Panel, stick around. When we come back, technical difficulties on Capitol Hill. You'll feel the pain. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BREAM: A gloomy night here in Washington, D.C., we want to take you live now to just outside the U.S. Capitol Hill where Congressman and Civil Rights icon John Lewis continues to lie in state where folks can come by and the lines have continued all day to pay their respects, and to remember him, the one who called for a good trouble to shake things up and to change our country, to force us to have tough conversations and make things better. That continues tonight here in Washington. His funeral will be on Thursday. Finally tonight, confusion on Capitol Hill. During a virtual Senate committee hearing on coronavirus relief, Republicans and Democrats finally found some common ground, but might not be what you'd expect. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: With that, Senator Romney. Is Senator Romney there? Why don't we go to Senator Hassan if she's available? Senator Carper? I'll just go down the list here. I don't see Senator Hassan. We'll go to Senator Carper? Here's Senator Romney. Senator Romney, are you ready to go? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I want to thank Senator Romney and Senator Hassan for yielding their time to me. I now have 21 minutes. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I come through here. Can you hear me all right? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Who have we got on? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Senator Romney, go ahead. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: OK, the hell with it. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No, no, Senator Romney. Romney? (END VIDEO CLIP) BREAM: OK. Everyone who has been doing virtual meetings, as you are trapped at home, we've all had that experience so - even Senators have it, too.

Union President\u00a0\u00a0delivered that battle cry during an address to union members, as Congress begins negotiations over a fresh tranche of federal aid expected to provide at least $70 billion to boost K-12 education. \u2018Let\u2019s be clear: Just as we have done with our health care workers, we will fight on all fronts for the safety of students and their educators,\u2019 Weingarten said on Tuesday. \u2018But if the authorities don\u2019t protect the safety and health of those we represent and those we serve, as our executive council voted last week, nothing is off the table \u2014 not advocacy or protests, negotiations, grievances or lawsuits, or, if necessary and authorized by a local union, as a last resort, safety strikes.\u2019\u201d\u00a0: \u201cA new Gallup poll shows a significant drop in Americans identifying as conservative and a rise in those identifying as liberal since February, as  and Republicans in Congress have struggled in the polls amid the coronavirus pandemic. The poll of 3,079 U.S. adults found that the number of Americans who identify as conservative dropped from 40% in February to just 34% in July. During the same period, the number who identify as moderate rose from 34% to 36%\u2013overtaking conservative identification\u2013while the number who identify as liberal rose from 22% to 26%.\u201d: \u201cEveryone attending the Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee next month will have to wear a face mask, consent to daily testing for COVID-19, fill out questionnaires and maintain a physical distance from others. Organizers of the convention released details of the coronavirus safety plan Monday, three weeks before the Aug. 17 start of the four-day event. The convention has been scaled down from original plans and now will be mostly online with only a few hundred people gathered at the Wisconsin Center in downtown Milwaukee. Attendees will have to self-isolated for a minimum of 72 hours before departing for Milwaukee or when first entering the convention\u2019s main venue if they\u2019re already in the city. Once at the convention, attendees must fill out a daily questionnaire indicating that they are not experiencing symptoms of COVID-19 and have not had contact with anyone who is infected.\u201d\u00a0: \u201cMs. []\u00a0, 55, is now among a handful of women under consideration to become \u2019s running mate. It is the latest stage in a path to power that has seen Ms. Rice chosen to be a Rhodes scholar at 21, an assistant secretary of state at 32 and ambassador to the United Nations little more than a decade later. \u2026 Ms. Rice\u2019s electoral inexperience is not the only possible mark against her in the vice-presidential process: In an election dominated by a public-health disaster and economic recession, it is unclear how much a candidate best known for her foreign policy credentials would improve Mr. Biden\u2019s chances. And there are people close to Mr. Biden who fear that choosing her would force the campaign to spend precious days relitigating her role in responding to the 2012 terrorist attack on the American mission in Benghazi, Libya, that left four Americans dead and prompted months of Republican-led congressional hearings.\u201d\u00a0: \u201cThe Biden campaign is forbidding staff from trading individual stocks without approval from the campaign\u2019s general counsel, according to an email sent by the Democratic nominee\u2019s top lawyer to staff on Monday afternoon. Joe Biden\u2019s general counsel, , wrote in an email to staff obtained by Bloomberg News that the campaign is updating its employee handbook to \u2018ensure that staff do not even inadvertently trade on nonpublic information.\u2019 The rule says staff cannot trade stocks \u2018without advance written approval of the General Counsel,\u2019 and it will remain in effect until Dec. 14, 2020, the date the Electoral College votes.\u201d: \u201cDonald Trump on Monday said he would accept the Republican nomination for president in North Carolina, marking a return to a state he spurned in June over its restriction of large gatherings due to the coronavirus. The announcement is the latest development in Trump\u2019s Republican National Convention walk-back and comes days after the president canceled his plans to host the convention's keynote events in Jacksonville, Fla. \u2018I'll be in North Carolina, and that's a very big deal because we have a lot of the delegates there and that'll be a nomination process,\u2019 Trump told WRAL, a Raleigh, N.C. television station. \u2018And that's essentially where the nomination, where it's formalized. And I'm really honored to do it in North Carolina.\u2019 Trump told WRAL he would announce the exact location of his acceptance speech in the coming week.\u201d\u00a0: \u201cPresident Donald Trump\u2019s reelection effort allegedly hid nearly $170 million in spending from mandatory public disclosure by routing payments through companies tied to his former campaign manager, a government oversight group said Tuesday. The use of firms linked to former campaign manager  masked the ultimate recipients of the money, which the nonpartisan Campaign Legal Center described as a \u2018laundering\u2019 effort that violates election law, according to a complaint the group filed with the Federal Elections Commission. Trump communications director disputed the allegations and said the \u2018campaign complies with all campaign finance laws and FEC regulations.\u2019 Most of the payments by Trump\u2019s campaign committees were made to American Made Media Consultants, which has received at least $177 million since 2018, according to FEC records. \u2026 The campaign said that American Made Media Consultants was formed to purchase advertising directly \u2014 and save money by not relying on middlemen.\u201d\u00a0: \u201cPresident Donald Trump is spending nearly all of his advertising money to keep states he won in 2016, playing a game of defense in areas a Republican incumbent should be able to count on. More than 92% of his state-based spending in the month of July is in states he won in 2016, according to a Bloomberg analysis of television advertising data compiled by Advertising Analytics. Joe Biden, leading in all national polls, is spending in seven key states that Trump won in 2016, too, banking on at least some of them swinging Democratic with widespread voter dissatisfaction over Trump\u2019s handling of the coronavirus and the accompanying economic crash. \u2026 The spending data paints a very different picture than Trump himself, who boasts that he\u2019s in strong shape for re-election and that a string of recent polls showing Biden leading comfortably are wrong. For an incumbent president to be defending so many once-friendly states is a sign of trouble.\u201d: \u201cIf he is losing badly among the two fastest-growing blocs of voters\u2014minorities and college-educated whites \u2013is there any hope for the president to win a second term? Yes, there is. And his reason for hope comes from a familiar place: the white working class. \u2026 There exists an assumption that because Trump cleaned up with noncollege-educated white voters in 2016 \u2013 winning them by a margin of 39 points\u2026\u00a0 \u2013 the president has maxed out his support among this much-mythologized group. But this is an assumption, not a fact. For one thing, there is evidence to suggest that while Trump won a bigger share of working-class whites than his predecessors, turnout among this group was higher in prior elections. Moreover, it\u2019s not clear that Democrats have bottomed out with this group; the same polarization that continues to depress Trump\u2019s upper-class white support could propel his working-class white support even higher.\u201d\u201cThe government of the Union, like that of each State, must be able to address itself immediately to the hopes and fears of individuals; and to attract to its support those passions which have the strongest influence upon the human heart.\u201d\u00a0\u2013\u00a0: \u201cFollowing its ratification by the necessary three-quarters of U.S. states, the 14th Amendment, granting citizenship to all persons born or naturalized in the United States \u2014 including formerly enslaved people \u2014 is officially adopted into the U.S. Constitution [on this day in 1868]. Secretary of State\u00a0\u00a0issues a proclamation certifying the amendment. Two years after the Civil War, the Reconstruction Acts of 1867 divided the South into five military districts, where new state governments, based on universal manhood suffrage, were to be established. Thus began the period known as Radical Reconstruction, which saw the 14th Amendment, which had been passed by Congress in 1866, ratified in July 1868. The amendment resolved pre-Civil War questions of African American citizenship by stating that \u2018all persons born or naturalized in the United States\u2026are citizens of the United States and of the state in which they reside.\u2019 The amendment then reaffirmed the privileges and rights of all citizens, and granted all these citizens the \u2018equal protection of the laws.\u2019\u201d\u00a0Email us at\u00a0\u00a0with your tips, comments or questions.NATIONAL HEAD-TO-HEAD AVERAGE40.6 percent\u00a051.8 percentBiden by 11.2 pointsBiden\u00a0\u2193\u00a00.4 points, Trump no change in points\n[.]\nBATTLEGROUND POWER RANKINGS\n(270 electoral votes needed to win)(109 electoral votes): Wisconsin (10), Ohio (18), Florida (29), Arizona (11), Pennsylvania (20), North Carolina (15), Iowa (6)(180 electoral votes)(249 electoral votes)\nTRUMP JOB PERFORMANCE\u00a040.8 percent\u00a056.4 percent\u00a0-15.6 points\u00a0\u2191\u00a00.2 points\n[.]\nWe\u2019ve brought \u201cFrom the Bleachers\u201d to video on demand thanks to Fox Nation.

The partnership stepped in after the University of Notre Dame withdrew from hosting the Sept. 29 debate because of \u2018the complexities COVID-19 created for its fall semester,\u2019 according to a press release. \u2026 Whether or not there might be an audience for the debate \u2018will depend on the status of the pandemic as the event moves closer.\u2019 The 477,000-square-foot pavilion is a collaborative learning space for students from CWRU\u2019s nursing, dental and medical schools. The joint project between the university and the Cleveland Clinic opened in the summer of 2019. The Cleveland Clinic has served as the health security adviser for the Commission on Presidential Debates on all of the fall\u2019s debates.\u201d: \u201cThe campaign of Republican Georgia Sen.\u00a0\u00a0removed a digital ad attacking Democratic opponent\u00a0\u00a0amid allegations of anti-Semitism after a report said it included an image that had been altered to make Ossoff\u2019s nose bigger. Ossoff, who is Jewish, claimed that the ad, which showed him and Senate Minority Leader\u00a0, D-N.Y., with the message, \u2018Democrats are trying to buy Georgia!\u2019 played on anti-Jewish stereotypes. Schumer is also Jewish. \u2018Sitting U.S. Senator David Perdue's digital attack ad distorted my face to enlarge and extend my nose,\u2019 Ossoff said in a statement. \u2018I'm Jewish. This is the oldest, most obvious, least original anti-Semitic trope in history. Senator, literally no one believes your excuses. You can start with an unqualified apology to Georgia\u2019s Jewish community.\u2019\u201d: \u201cThe Boston Globe endorsed Sen.\u00a0\u00a0(D-Mass.) in his primary battle against Rep.\u00a0\u00a0(D-Mass.), calling him a \u2018progressive champion with a solid track record.\u2019 The paper\u2019s editorial board\u2019s endorsement that came late on Monday pointed to Markey\u2019s calls for environmental advocacy stemming back to the 1980s and painted him as one of the original champions of the environment. \u2018Decades before CNN hosted its first town hall for presidential candidates devoted to climate change, and decades before Greta Thunberg, the Swedish teenage activist, was named Time magazine\u2019s 'Person of the Year,' Markey worked to make the air we breathe cleaner and to stave off the catastrophic heat waves, droughts, and rising seas poised to displace millions of people around the world,\u2019 the board wrote.\u201d: \u201cSenate Majority Leader\u00a0\u00a0isn\u2019t typically one to jettison half his conference. But with an election on the line, coronavirus aid is the exception. McConnell and senior senators on Monday unveiled their proposal for the next COVID-19 relief package, calling for liability protections and hundreds of billions of dollars in funding for health care providers, economic aid, and schools. In doing so, the Republican leader is prioritizing vulnerable incumbents up for reelection this year over the budget hawks who won\u2019t face voters for another cycle or two. \u2018Inaction is a nonstarter,\u2019 said\u00a0, a former McConnell adviser. \u2026 More than a half-dozen Republican senators on the ballot this year are clamoring for action, including McConnell. On the Senate floor Monday, he proposed the collective package as a starting point for negotiations with Democrats. \u2018The American people need more help,\u2019 McConnell said. \u2026 Republicans\u2019 introduction of legislation kicks off negotiations with Democrats, who have been eager to start with talks since the House passed a much larger relief package more than two months ago.\u201d: \u201cA fraught showdown over the next coronavirus relief bill got underway Monday as Senate Republicans unveiled a $1 trillion package and congressional Democratic leaders met with top White House officials. All parties faced a tight deadline for a breakthrough as expanded jobless aid benefits are set to expire later this week. The prospects for a bipartisan deal remained far from certain as House Speaker  (D-Calif.) and Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) met late Monday with Treasury Secretary  and White House Chief of Staff  to begin formal negotiations. The White House officials described the talks as productive and said they would resume on Tuesday, but Democrats left the nearly two hour meeting describing the initial GOP offer as inadequate.\u201d: \u201cThe Commerce Department petitioned the Federal Communications Commission on Monday to narrow the liability protections of online companies, as President directed in May in what he pitched as a crackdown on anti-conservative bias. Monday's petition includes a request that the FCC impose a regulatory requirement on social media companies, even though the agency doesn't regulate them. The FCC is an independent agency outside Trump's direct control, although he has nominated its five members. What the administration says: \u2018It has long been the policy of the United States to foster a robust marketplace of ideas on the Internet and the free flow of information around the world,\u2019 said Commerce Secretary\u00a0\u00a0in a statement. \u2018President Trump is committed to protecting the rights of all Americans to express their views and not face unjustified restrictions or selective censorship from a handful of powerful companies.\u2019\u201d: \u201cDr.\u00a0\u00a0on Tuesday dismissed dubious medical advice President Donald Trump shared on Twitter the previous evening, vowing to continue in his role as the country\u2019s top infectious disease expert despite a new salvo of attacks from the White House. In an interview Tuesday morning on ABC\u2019s \u2018Good Morning America,\u2019 Fauci promoted best practices for combating the coronavirus and repeatedly contradicted the president, who tweeted more than a dozen times Monday night in defense of hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for Covid-19. One of the messages Trump retweeted featured a video of a woman who claimed to be a Houston physician, surrounded by others in white lab coats outside what appeared to be the U.S. Supreme Court, advocating on behalf of the antimalarial medication and discouraging the use of face masks. That post has since been flagged by Twitter and removed from the president\u2019s feed. Twitter also restricted\u00a0\u2019s account Tuesday after he shared a version of the same video.\u201d-\u00a0\n\u201cNo.\u201d \u2013\u00a0\u201cYour column has now become the tabloid of election coverage.

Meanwhile, the organized labor spotlight has been taken over by public sector unions like SEIU and NEA, which have a political agenda far to the left of the average AFL-CIO or Teamsters member.Even so, union leaders have tended to stick with Democrats \u2014 that is, until they meet Donald Trump.He\u2019s spent his entire career working with unions in New York; he also speaks \u201cblue-collar\u201d better than any Republican since Abe Lincoln. He came to the presidency blasting the trade deals with China that doomed America\u2019s manufacturing base.\u00a0As president, he renegotiated NAFTA, another union sore point. His trade and manufacturing advisor Peter Navarro is a proven friend of labor, who has advocated restoring our defense industrial base and shipbuilding industry\u2014both strongholds of organized union labor.By comparison, Joe Biden\u2019s record is a political train wreck.\u00a0 Even though candidate Barack Obama enthusiastically courted Big Labor support,\u00a0and Biden likes to pretend he\u2019s got the unions\u2019 back,\u00a0when Obama and Biden ran the White House unions actually lost half a million members.\u00a0Overall, the Obama years saw some 300,000 manufacturing jobs get swept into oblivion \u2014 jobs that, as Obama famously said at a town hall in June 2016, \u201care just not going to come back.\u201d He even scoffed that Donald Trump would need a \u201cmagic wand\u201d to make that happen.Well, Trump found that wand.A 2018 Texas Public Policy Foundation study found that compared to the last 21 months of the Obama administration, the first 21 months of the Trump presidency boosted manufacturing employment by 3.1 percent\u00a0\u2014\u00a0meaning that ten times more manufacturing jobs were added under Trump, compared to the Obama-Biden years.Of course, labor unions still show declining membership, which is at its lowest ebb since 1983\u2014while the onset of COVID-19 and the Great Lockdown has put paid to much of that manufacturing surge.Still, a second Trump term bolstered by union support would mean an economic resurgence geared toward those industries where union members are crucial, from our defense industrial base to infrastructure projects.By contrast, a Biden presidency promises labor only more unemployment checks, especially in the energy industry which is a specific target of Rep. Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s Green New Deal. According to a study by the National Ocean Industries Association, Biden\u2019s offshore drilling ban alone could cost 200,000 or more jobs.\u00a0 Even worse, the radical turn among Democrats has fomented violence in the streets and sustained attacks on police departments and America\u2019s heritage, as well as imposing a state-by-state lockdown to cripple Trump\u2019s economic rebound.All in all, Democrats in 2020 offer a hard-left agenda that ought to worry workers of every color, creed\u00a0and industry, including those belonging to unions.It\u2019s not too late for Trump to seek out union support for major portions of his agenda, from reshoring manufacturing and decoupling from China to basic law and order issues.The question is, whether the unions realize that their future may also be at stake in November, not to mention the country\u2019s.", "comment": "(483)", "topic": "OPINION", "date": " July 21"}, {"cover": "https://a57.foxnews.com/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/694940094001/b04b7647-965a-4fe3-ad87-3b98a5e73531/fafcbe19-2f89-4907-a1e4-e43679e5a256/1280x720/match/156/88/image.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "title": "Biden is a Bubba, not Obama lite", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-is-a-bubba-not-obama-lite", "subtitle": "There\u2019s been a great deal of talk across the political pitch about a former Democratic president and his influence on the party now.", "keyword": "presidential election and trade war", "website": "Fox News", "author": "Chris Stirewalt", "content": ".\u00a0There\u2019s been a great deal of talk across the political pitch about a former Democratic president and his influence on the party now. It\u2019s just they\u2019re talking about the wrong one.\nAfter winning a second term with a rout of Sen.\u00a0\u00a0in 1996,\u00a0\u00a0declared that he would govern from the \u201cvital American center.\u201d\nClinton, as has often been his wont, was taking some liberties. In this case, it was the phrase \u201cvital center,\u201d coined by liberal historian and Kennedy brain trustee\u00a0. Schlesinger, in his 1949 book of the same name, was talking about the contest between totalitarianism and liberal democracy on the world stage. Clinton was repurposing the term to suit his vision of American domestic policy and politics.\u00a0As Democrats would come to realize in a second Clinton term, the Arkansan revival of Camelot was decidedly less charming than the one set in Cape Cod.\nClinton\u2019s dream was to create a lasting majority for Democrats by bringing back those white, working-class voters who had been drifting away from the party since 1968 \u2013 the kinds of traditional Democrats who voted for\u00a0\u00a0and\u00a0. Clinton\u2019s win in 1996, he believed, foreshadowed a powerful new coalition of Black voters, liberal women and \u201cBubbas\u201d like him.A guy who won combinations no Democrat had in decades \u2013 Arizona and Massachusetts, Oregon and Louisiana \u2013 had some powerful evidence that such a coalition might be possible. The liberal, urban party born out of the Civil Rights Act and the Vietnam War might really be replaced with a pragmatic, pro-business, culturally moderate blob that could retake and hold the House and Senate while simultaneously cracking the Republican electoral map.\u00a0\u00a0Clinton was all about \u201claw and order,\u201d famously once leaving the campaign trail in 1992 to make sure that a developmentally disabled man was executed in Arkansas and pushing federal agents onto the streets of big cities to end the crack wars as president.\nClinton was also against permissive welfare programs, swiping the issue right out from under Republicans\u2019 noses. As he had proclaimed in his State of the Union address that year, \u201cthe era of big government is over.\u201d \u00a0Clinton was all about business, too, exulting in the dotcom boom and record profits on Wall Street. As he was schmoozing with\u00a0\u00a0and getting $200 haircuts on Air Force One, Clinton was dispelling that old un-glamorous liberal baggage.\nAnd unlike one-termer\u00a0, Clinton wasn\u2019t afraid to flex America\u2019s muscle, lobbing airstrikes hither and yon and declaring as part of his election-year reboot in a 1996 speech that America was \u201cthe indispensable nation\u201d that would shape the post-Cold War world. So much for the party\u2019s Vietnam syndrome, right?Like\u00a0\u00a0and\u00a0, Bill Clinton was going to have it all \u2013 country and rock n\u2019 roll. And he promised, in one of the groaners of modern political rhetoric, to \u201cbuild a bridge to the 21st\u00a0century.\u201d\nBut, that\u2019s not what happened at all. Unlike the new coalitions that endured long after\u00a0\u2019s and Nixon\u2019s presidencies, the Clinton era had the shelf life of a cut avocado. The center, it turned out, wasn\u2019t so vital after all. It wasn\u2019t really even \u201cthe center,\u201d but rather a temporary coalition driven by, among other factors, a weak Republican Party with bad nominees who were captive to an increasingly radical base.\u00a0When Clinton left office after a furious legacy-building effort in the wake of his victory over\u00a0\u2019s ill-conceived, poorly executed impeachment effort, many signs suggested that the 42nd\u00a0president\u2019s hopes had been realized.\u00a0\nWhile then-Vice President\u00a0\u2019s somnambulant profusion of earth tones came up just short in 2000 after losing his home state of Tennessee, Clinton\u2019s Arkansas and longtime Democratic bastion West Virginia, the president left office with sky-high popularity, the Senate back in Democratic hands and an eroded Republican majority in the House.\u00a0But Republicans had learned a thing or two and Democrats were already forgetting Clinton\u2019s lessons. The GOP was consolidating its hold on states that had been competitive or Democratic-leaning locally despite Republican votes for president. The great GOP victory of 1994 turned out not to be the House, but the 10 governors\u2019 mansions that broke an era of Democratic hyper-dominance on the state level.\u00a0typified the new Republican model: A socially conservative, pro-government chief executive from a state that had kept a strong Democratic lean at home long after its 1972 switch to the GOP in national politics. The Red Team wasn\u2019t going to be out-Bubbaed by Bubba anymore.\nIn 2004, Democrats did\u00a0what Clinton and his vital centrists at the Democratic Leadership Council told them never to do: They nominated another dovish liberal from Massachusetts who was easily caricatured by the Bush campaign as weak effete. In 2008, the party went farther left and picked an African American liberal from Illinois \u2013 explicitly rejecting the demand of the House of Clinton to be returned to the throne.\u00a0had shown some chops with that vital center business. He mounted his 2004 Senate campaign with an explicitly bipartisan pitch of a country beyond divisions of red and blue. And as he rolled to victory in 2008 with the help of the twin Republican miseries of the Iraq War and financial panic, Obama continued to reach for the center.\nBut as president, he proved to be a consistent, hardline partisan. His defenders argued that Republicans were different and worse than they were before \u2013 that somehow the party was more acidly partisan than the one that impeached Clinton \u2013 and were unworthy of further wooing.\nWhatever his reasoning, Obama\u2019s goal became to break the GOP and not co-opt it. The Bubbas, he decided, would be consigned to the ash heap of history as the power of older, socially conservative white voters was overwhelmed in a demographic wave.Obama in his post presidency has rediscovered his role as the shamanistic healer once\u00a0\u00a0by\u00a0. But as we saw in his funeral pitch for ending the legislative filibuster in the Senate, Obama is a sharp-elbowed partisan through and through.Which brings us to\u00a0, who once embodied Obama\u2019s small nod to the lingering necessity of Bubbas. Biden is\u00a0a Clintonite lover of bipartisan deal making and the clinches (often literally) of blue-collar white voters in places like his native Pennsylvania.\u00a0Democrats, with lots of help from Biden, have managed to forget his long history as middle-of-the road, pro-business, law-and-order kind of Senator from Delaware. Biden was a considerable player in the long project to revive Democrats from their post-Vietnam, post-Carter malaise.\nWhile that certainly may help Biden this fall as he steams toward the presidency with the kinds of tactical advantages that not even Obama enjoyed in 2008, it may end up creating serious heartburn for Democrats.They think they\u2019ve got the heir to Obama, but what they have is a latent Bubba.\u201cWith [France and Britain] and with most other European nations we are rivals in navigation and the carrying trade; and we shall deceive ourselves if we suppose that any of them will rejoice to see it flourish; for, as our carrying trade cannot increase without in some degree diminishing theirs, it is more their interest, and will be more their policy, to restrain than to promote it.\u201d \u2013\u00a0: \u201cWith his distinctive hair, gentle voice, and signature expressions such as \u2018happy little trees,\u2019 [] an enduring icon.

And two more hours of high-level talks on Thursday night between Treasury Secretary  and White House chief of staff  on one side and Speaker  (D-Calif.) and Senate Minority Leader  (D-N.Y.) on the other yielded almost no progress. The talks will continue through the weekend, but a deal seems far off at this point. \u2026 The end of the $600-per-week federal benefit, when combined with the lapsing of an eviction moratorium, will likely lead to serious financial problems for those hit hardest by the pandemic and economic collapse. More than 1.4 million people filed initial unemployment claims last week, according to the Department of Labor, while the U.S. economy contracted by more than nine percent in the second quarter of 2020, the worst drop on record.\u201d: \u201cThe White House is willing to cut a deal with Democrats that leaves out Senate Republican legislation aimed at protecting employers, hospitals and schools from coronavirus-related lawsuits, according to two people with knowledge of internal White House planning. The White House wants and is pushing for the \u2018liability shield\u2019 as a top priority but would be willing to sign off on a deal that lacks the legal protections, those people said. Senate Majority Leader  (R-Ky.) controls the Senate floor and could shoot down any deal that leaves out what he has said is a necessary component of any stimulus package. One of the people familiar with the administration\u2019s thinking said the measure was \u2018considered important but not absolutely essential.\u2019 The dealmaking flexibility conflicts with the ultimatum McConnell has given Democrats that any congressional stimulus package must make it significantly harder for workers and customers to sue employers and businesses for damages related to the coronavirus.\u201d\u00a0: \u201cOnce a coronavirus vaccine is approved as safe and effective, Americans should have widespread access within a reasonable time, Dr.\u00a0\u00a0assured lawmakers Friday. Appearing before a House panel investigating the nation\u2019s response to the pandemic, Fauci expressed \u2018cautious\u2019 optimism that a vaccine would be available, particularly by next year. \u2018I believe, ultimately, over a period of time in 2021, that Americans will be able to get it,\u2019 Fauci said, referring to the vaccine. There will be a priority list for who gets early vaccinations. \u2018I don\u2019t think we will have everybody getting it immediately,\u2019 Fauci explained. But \u2018ultimately, within a reasonable time, the plans allow for any American who needs the vaccine to get it,\u2019 he added. Under direction from the White House, federal health authorities are carrying out a plan dubbed Operation Warp Speed to manufacture 300 million doses of a vaccine on a compressed timeline.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0: \u201cPresident 's campaign has virtually disappeared from the airwaves as it undertakes \u2018a review and fine-tuning of the campaign's strategy\u2019 as an official put it after the replacement of campaign manager\u00a0. With less than 100 days until Election Day, the Trump campaign spent virtually nothing on television or radio ads on Wednesday and Thursday, according to data from Advertising Analytics. And it has effectively nothing booked through August. Meanwhile, 's campaign has spent $3.9 million over those two days and has another almost $6 million booked through the end of August. When asked about the lack of spending, a Trump campaign official pointed to the decision earlier this month to demote Parscale and elevate deputy campaign manager\u00a0\u00a0to fill that role. \u2018With the leadership change in the campaign, there's understandably a review and fine-tuning of the campaign's strategy. We\u2019ll be back on the air shortly, even more forcefully exposing Joe Biden as a puppet of the radical left-wing,\u2019 the official told NBC News.\u201d\u00a0: \u201cA Mason-Dixon Poll of registered voters in Florida shows Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden with a slight lead over Republican President Donald Trump in the state. \u2026Biden has the support of 50% of likely general election voters, while 46% of respondents support President Trump. The remaining 4% were undecided. \u2026 Results of the poll show that Biden leads in the crucial swing area of Tampa Bay, where he has 52% support of likely voters versus President Trump\u2019s 42%. \u2026 The results also show an age divide. Among 18- to 34-year-old people, the poll shows Biden has 66% support versus President Trump\u2019s 29% support. Among people ages 35-49, Biden has the support of 53% versus the president\u2019s 44%. \u202651% of people ages 50-64 and up support the president while 46% support Biden. The poll shows of people ages 65 and up, 52% back the president while 43% support Biden.\u201d: \u201cWhen the Trump experience is over, the Republican Party will have to be rebuilt. It will have to begin with tens of millions of voters who previously supported Mr. Trump. It will have to decide where it stands, its reason for being. It won\u2019t be enough to repeat old mantras or formulations from 1970 to 2000. It\u2019s 2020. We\u2019re a different country. A lot is going to have to be rethought. Simple human\u00a0\u00a0will be key. Rebuilding doesn\u2019t start with fires, purges and lists of those you want ejected from the party. Many if not most of those calling for burning the whole thing down are labeled \u2018Never Trump,\u2019 and a lot of them are characterologically quick to point the finger of blame. \u2026 The party\u2019s national leaders and strategists don\u2019t have a lot to be proud of the past few decades. The future of the party will probably bubble up from the states.\u201d: \u201cThe Lincoln Project has not been suddenly exposed making common cause with Democrats \u2014 making common cause with Democrats in opposition to Trump and Trumpism is its\u00a0. Maybe some conservative critics do not think that is a good or worthy undertaking, but those who are engaging with the Lincoln Project have an intellectual obligation to address the actual argument being advanced; i.e., that Donald Trump and his administration represent a special kind of awful that requires bipartisan repudiation. Agree or disagree, that is the question raised by the Lincoln Project. The fact that the Lincoln Project sometimes airs ads on\u00a0\u00a0is entirely beside the point. What is most worrisome to me is not that Republicans do not by and large agree with the Lincoln Project\u2019s critique but that they are incapable of taking it seriously. They dismiss it as being of interest only to four self-aggrandizing politicos, but there is a great deal of evidence that this is simply not the case.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0: \u201cCalifornia\u2019s leaders were deadlocked and on the verge of financial catastrophe in 2008. Five negotiators, including Republican Gov.\u00a0, couldn\u2019t agree on a budget that would guide the nation\u2019s most populous state through the Great Recession. Enter\u00a0, who became Assembly speaker that May, the first Black woman to hold the role. She shifted the tone of the talks, helping the group find common ground. \u2026 A dozen years later, the bridge-building, unassuming style that colleagues say made Bass an effective leader in Sacramento is among the reasons the current California congresswoman has emerged as a leading contender to become\u00a0Joe Biden\u2019s running mate. The presumptive Democratic presidential nominee appeared with Bass for the first time at a fundraiser on Thursday. He plans to make a pick next week. A former physician\u2019s assistant and community organizer, Bass said she brings experience to tackle the nation\u2019s economic, racial and health care crises.\u201d\u00a0: \u201cThe biggest newspaper in California\u2019s capital city is urging Joe Biden to choose Rep. Karen Bass of California as his running mate instead of the other Golden State politician who\u2019s being seriously considered \u2013 Sen.\u00a0. \u2018If Biden chooses a California VP, he likely won\u2019t pick Karen Bass,\u2019 the Sacramento Bee editorial board wrote. \u2018Clearly, however, the community activist whose passion for service led others to draft her into electoral politics is the better choice.\u2019 And the newspaper warned that \u2018the Biden campaign should be concerned about things like the secret $400,000 settlement Harris\u2019 office paid to settle \u2018gender harassment\u2019 claims against a top aide named\u00a0.\u201d\u00a0: \u201cSen. , D-Ill., wants to give struggling coal communities a jolt of new federal investment and help transition out-of-work miners into new jobs and cleaner energy production. Duckworth, considered a potential running mate for Joe Biden, introduced sweeping new legislation this month that gives Medicare coverage to laid-off coal workers, provides tuition-free college for coal workers and their families, calls for a $15 dollar minimum wage and modifies U.S. bankruptcy rules to require coal companies to pay for worker health care and pensions benefits. \u2026 There's no cost estimate yet on her legislation, but Duckworth says it's time to think big about the untapped economic opportunities in coal communities. She calls her proposal a Marshall Plan for Coal Country, a nod to the post-World War II investment program to rebuild war-torn cities, industries and infrastructure in Western Europe.\u201d\u00a0: \u201cA Democratic Party meeting that leaders hoped would project unity weeks ahead of the national convention instead broke out into a behind-the-scenes feud over corporate money in politics. At a virtual gathering of a key committee for the Democratic National Convention,\u00a0-allied members said Joe Biden appointees called them \u2018children\u2019 and made other rude comments in a breakout room where they were talking privately. The argument served as a reminder of the tensions that are still simmering below the surface between moderate and progressives as the party seeks a united front against President Donald Trump. It also shows the limited power of Biden and Sanders, whose teams worked closely to hash out a deal on another plan under consideration by the committee with the goal of showing harmony. \u2018It was not only disturbing, but disrespectful,\u2019 said\u00a0, Sanders\u2019 former campaign co-chair who served on the committee.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0: \u201cAs the Kansas Senate primary barrels to a close, tensions are rising between Senate Republicans and the White House over the potential nomination of\u00a0, who party officials fear would jeopardize the seat and further imperil their Senate majority. Senator Mitch McConnell is worried that Mr. Kobach, the controversial former Kansas secretary of state who lost the 2018 governor\u2019s race, may win the nomination in Tuesday\u2019s primary, only to lose the seat in November \u2014 and he is frustrated that President Trump is not intervening in the race, according to multiple G.O.P. officials. Mr. McConnell and other Senate Republican leaders have made urgent pleas to the president to block Mr. Kobach by endorsing one of his opponents, Representative\u00a0. But Mr. Trump has so far declined to do so, and his aides said they had no plans to change course. Compounding the frustration of Capitol Hill Republicans, White House aides have refused to tell Mr. Kobach, a longtime booster of Mr. Trump, to stop using the president\u2019s imagery in his campaign materials.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0-\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cWe the people, including congressmen and presidents, can have differing views on how to perfect our union while sharing the conviction that our nation, however flawed, is a good and noble one.\u201d \u2013\u00a0\u00a0Tune in this weekend as Mr. Sunday sits down with Rep.\u00a0, D-Calif., Sen.\u00a0, D-Ill., and Trump campaign senior advisor\u00a0.

In an obituary published this weekend in the Buffalo News, Scarsella's family paid tribute to her by detailing the many things she enjoyed, such as her affinity for books, slot machines and video games. \u2018She loved to read. Her favorite author was\u00a0. She had a private library of hundreds of books,\u2019 Scarsella's obituary reads. \u2026 Scarsella \u2014 who died on July 19 \u2014 was also a sports fan, and aside from her Yankees fandom, she had a deep fondness for NBA star\u00a0, her family explained. But as most New Yorkers can relate to, Scarsella had it out for one former New England Patriots player. \u2018She was an avid sports fan,\u2019 Scarsella's obituary continued. \u2018She loved the New York Yankees and Lebron James. She HATED\u00a0.\u2019\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u201cThe pardon is for tyrants.

For generations, what shocked the people in charge of this country was political violence, hurting your neighbors for having different opinions. They were appalled by that and they were right to be.Political violence isn't simply an assault on individual Americans, it's an attack on America itself. In this country, we govern by consent, not by force. People with guns don't make our laws, voters do.You may have a Glock in your hand, but on Election Day, you have precisely as many votes as the little old lady who disagrees with you. That's our system. The weak are supposed to have as much power over the government as the strong, and that is the basis of our equality as Americans, something that we should cherish and protect.Political violence immediately short circuits this. It ends democracy. Violence instead returns us to the most primitive of all systems, one in which might makes right. People who hurt others get to do exactly what they want. Everyone else has to obey them. There is no greater threat to civilization than this and we used to understand that because it's obvious.But things have changed. The people who run this country are no longer shocked by political violence. They welcome it. They slyly encourage it. They are its beneficiaries.They tell us the only real crimes are thought crimes. It's okay to set fires or smash strangers in the face with two by fours, so long as you are chanting the correct slogans. If you're on the right team, everything is allowed.But if you dare to dissent from the orthodoxy, you will be swiftly punished. Go ahead and express the wrong opinion. Try it in a meeting, try it on Facebook, they will find you. You will lose your job, your reputation, possibly even your life.The message they're sending you is very clear. Americans are not equal anymore. There are two standards in this country, one standard for them and a very different standard for you.Over the weekend, we saw exactly what they will excuse from their own supporters. Armed mobs of Joe Biden voters torched, buildings, smashed cars, attacked police officers. They rioted. They hurt people, a lot of people -- and the media, watching closely lied about all of it. They pretended it didn't happen. They made excuses for it. They buried the truth in euphemism.The liars of \"The New York Times\" described the riots as quote, \"protests,\" as if the violence was justified or could be justified. Here's the truth about what happened. Here's what actually happened in Seattle over the weekend. Take a look.[VIDEO CLIP PLAYS]CARLSON: Protests? No, these were not protests. These were scenes from a war. The rioters threw rocks, bottles, wood, explosives at police. One explosion left an eight inch hole in a police precinct.Because no lie is too absurd for CNN to tell, the network described violence against police as quote, \"a demonstration against police violence.\" Got that? It's a perfect inversion of the truth worthy of 1984. Ignorance is strength. Freedom is slavery. War is peace.They repeat it because they expect you to believe it and no doubt some do.Meanwhile, Seattle Police Department gamely tried to push back by releasing actual body cam footage of the violence. It is not clear how many people saw it. So, we're going to show some of you -- we're going to show some of it to you right here.[VIDEO CLIP PLAYS]CARLSON: A total of 59 police officers were injured in this demonstration against police violence. CNN would like you to believe they attacked themselves, they did not, not in Seattle, not anywhere.In Oakland, the mobs with helmets and shields attacked a police station. They shot cops with fireworks. They set fire to a courthouse. Here are pictures of it.[VIDEO CLIP PLAYS]CARLSON: According to NBC News, the rioters you just saw were quote, \"protesters.\" They burned the courthouse quote, \"after a peaceful demonstration intensified.\" Oh intensified, just like the World Trade Center collapsed when a commercial airline flight intensified.It's remarkable. You've got to believe there are still normal people working at ABC News, maybe in the tape library or in the cafeteria. Are they watching their own coverage? How can they stand it? The apologies for violence, the relentless shameless lying?It's hard to believe they haven't resigned. They probably have mortgages and kids who feel for them. Just as you feel for the cameraman who would flee the mob in Sacramento over the weekend.They were surrounded and apparently assaulted by 150 Joe Biden voters dressed in black paramilitary gear, and had to run for their lives. You'd think other journalists would be sympathetic to this, they used to be? Not anymore.The stakes are too high. We've got an election coming up and so instead they lie to provide cover for the rioters, the ones who threatened the cameraman.The Sacramento Bee took pains to tell you that the protests are actually peaceful. The newspaper did its best to downplay the violence, including the fact that so-called protesters are trying to disarm police helicopters with laser pointers.One of the peaceful protesters ran through the streets with a chainsaw in order to block traffic, no problem. Nothing to see here.Meanwhile, at mostly peaceful protests in Austin and Aurora, Colorado people were shot. In downtown Louisville, heavily armed militia and military outfits walked through the city threatening violence if police officers weren't sent to jail. No problem, just a protest. In Milwaukee, a black Trump supporter named Bernell Trammell was executed in front of his office in broad daylight. He was killed.In Portland, Oregon, police seized a bag filled with rifle magazines and Molotov cocktails, not a big deal.City leaders in Portland ignored 60 straight days of rioting. It's fine, they say. Really? Here is how Portland looked over the weekend.[VIDEO CLIP PLAYS]CARLSON: This isn't fine. It's not normal. It's not a protest. These aren't children. These are adults, and they're destroying our country. They're completely out of control. They're violent.Are they punished? No. Where's the Justice Department in this? Don't we have an Attorney General? Isn't he supposed to be conservative? Why are we allowing this?Chad Wolf runs the Department of Homeland Security. Wolf, whatever you think of him has been one of the very few officials in Washington, who seems to notice that any of this is happening. He sent Federal law enforcement to Portland to keep the mob from burning down the Federal Courthouse there, which the mob does not own. It is Federal property. They have no right to torch it. It's not theirs. It's ours.For doing that, for being one of the very few to actually push back a little bit, he was punished. The mob came to Chad Wolf's home yesterday, and they threatened him and his family and they didn't do it suddenly. It wasn't subtext. They said it out loud on camera. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We must make social consequences for these men and women.GROUP: Yes, yes.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We must make it uncomfortable for them. We will not be good Germans. We are angry neighbors. You can't live here quietly and is able to live just like us.(END VIDEO CLIP)CARLSON: Oh, she is trying to figure out why the Department of Justice isn't actually doing anything? Why they haven't frog marched the leaders of Antifa in front of the camera? Why they haven't stopped this stuff? While they're acting like they're powerless?Maybe they don't want mobs like this in front of their houses. Maybe mob violence works. \"We must make it uncomfortable for them,\" she says in a megaphone. What does that mean? Well, we don't need to guess because we just spent all weekend watching what it means.Here's the contrast that we should never forget. Things change so quickly. You imagine things have always been this way, but they haven't.There's a presidential election a few months from now. If you disagree with what Chad Wolf has done, you get to vote against Chad Wolf's boss, and Chad Wolf will be out of a job. That's the way we used to do it, when this was a democracy. But not anymore. Now they just go and threaten Chad Wolf's children and the media applaud.Last month, a radio show host in Seattle called Paul Gallant mocked reports that his city was descending into chaos. These were peaceful protests, he suggested. On Twitter, Gallant reported that he saw, quote, \"no burning, pillaging or deaths.\" Of course those things were happening. They existed. We showed you tape of it at the time.But Gallant pretended otherwise. We don't know why we'd have to assume because he thought it would help his team. Then the rioters showed up in the building where he lives, in his apartment building and they destroyed the Starbucks downstairs and that scared him.Now, Gallant says he is buying a gun. Ah, it turns out it's not so easy to lie about violence when it's aimed at you.Jason Rantz is a Seattle based radio host. We're happy to have him on tonight. Jason, thanks so much for coming on. So you just had a lot of violence in the City of Seattle over the weekend. Tell us what you saw and tell us what the reaction from local government was, please.JASON RANTZ, SEATTLE RADIO SHOW HOST: Well, it's almost like we're dealing with a masterclass of gaslighting because I know what I saw and I know what a lot of people who saw the images that I posted online saw, which was violence, which was arson against five construction trailers, which was a Starbucks that was completely ransacked, and someone tried to set it on fire and they didn't know of course stop at Starbucks. They also impacted some other businesses.But we're being told that it's peaceful or maybe it's just a few people, it's a few bad apples in a larger crowd. As if they were redecorating the Starbucks with their rocks, as if they were celebrating police by throwing fireworks at them.What we're seeing is violence. What we saw was a riot and anyone who says otherwise is lying to you. I understand that there's some nuance to go into when you're talking about a very large crowd and there are like two or three bad actors, but the entire crowd is almost full of bad actors.It started off peaceful on Saturday, as they walked to the Juvenile Detention Center. There was about 4,000 to 5,000 people. Then they set it on fire. And then all of a sudden, that crowd was about 1,500.The people who stayed are the bad actors. The people who stayed are the rioters. The people who stayed were saying some horrible things and their goal was not to protest against police brutality. This has nothing to do with George Floyd. This has everything to do with a very specific ideology, and I think that there are politicians and media members who believe that this is going to create enough momentum and chaos to get Donald Trump out of office.I think it's a mistake. I think it's going to backfire on them, but I do think some of them are willing to sit by and see some of these cities complete get destroyed. And yes, some people lose their lives. It's an evil position to take, all because they are justifying, well, if we can get Donald Trump out of office, this guy who was supposed to lead us to the end of civilization, it didn't quite actually happen over the period of the last three and a half years. But this time, it'll happen if he gets reelected. They've convinced themselves this.CARLSON: I don't know what kind of person could justify harming individuals in the name of winning a presidential campaign. I don't think any decent person on either side would ever do that, and I mean it.'RANTZ: He will be --CARLSON: I think that's right. I think that's right. Great to see tonight. Thank you.RANTZ: Good to see.'CARLSON: Well, speaking of violence, one of the epicenters of it in this country, and this has been true for a while now, tragically is Chicago. Two thousand two hundred and forty three people have been shot in the city of Chicago so far this year. How many people is that? It's enough to feel 46 fully loaded school buses, and indeed many of them were children.The mayor of Chicago, Lori Lightfoot doesn't like the police and she is responding to this crisis by demanding more police units outside of her home. Wait a second. She doesn't like police, but she wants more cops outside her home. Why is that? Because her safety is the only thing she cares about.She knows she presides over a city where people are getting killed, and she doesn't want to be one of them.Now, sources tell this show that her district Police Commander refused to move more cops into her neighborhood. He said that his officers are already stretched too thin protecting the citizens of Chicago. For this he was punished, he was promptly reassigned to another unit.We asked the Mayor's Office about this and they angrily denied it. They said the mayor had no role in the reassignment of the Police Commander. Of course, they didn't pledge to jump in and fix it. We'll let you decide whether they're telling the truth or not.Anthony Napolitano is an alderman in the City of Chicago and he joins us tonight. Alderman, thanks so much for coming on.ANTHONY NAPOLITANO, ALDERMAN, CHICAGO: Hi, Tucker. How are you?CARLSON: I'm well, but the idea that the Mayor of Chicago asked for police protection for herself when thousands have been shot in the city so far this year makes me dizzy, the hypocrisy of that.NAPOLITANO: Yes, you know, honestly, I can't attest to that situation in general. But what I can tell you talking to many police officers and many high ranking officers, there are a lot of these commanders, these captains, these lieutenants that are getting to the boiling point right now. They're just -- they feel so understaffed. They don't have enough men and women, police officers on the street, and when they're forced to reallocate police to different portions of the city that can't handle the crime going on right now, they are leaving their districts and their neighborhoods more vulnerable.It's getting to the point right now, like I said before, we're not able to keep up with the rate of attrition because these bosses are retiring. They feel like they're leaving their men and women out there in harm's way and it's a scary point right now for them.CARLSON: So if you look at the crime stats in the city, and they are overwhelming and tragic because each one represents a life ended, or certainly halted, you've got to kind of know -- no honest person could conclude that the police are responsible for 2,400 shootings this year. They're not. The cops didn't do that.What's the purpose of pulling back the police in the middle of a crime wave, honestly?NAPOLITANO: You know, if you actually look at the stats, I think shooting wise in the City of Chicago, police account for maybe 0.06 percent of the shooting.CARLSON: Exactly.NAPOLITANO: Compiled, actually our numbers in eight years is almost 23,000 people were shot. Pulling them back right now, I don't know. It just doesn't -- it doesn't make any sense. We can't -- we can't get enough police officers actually to even take this job right now because of the defund movement and the anti-police movement.But on top of it right now, officers don't -- they're not afraid to be the police, they want to be given the go ahead to be the police and have someone actually back them, someone get behind them and know that they're doing job the best to their ability and mistakes will happen, but you're going to back them on behalf of saving the city.Pulling resources is just -- I live in the 16th District, 32 square miles, sometimes we'll have three to four police officers patrolling the 16th District. That's absolutely ludicrous. We should have anywhere between 32 and 38 on the street in our district, but it's based on the reallocation of officers to other areas. It's forcing officers off this job.CARLSON: It's terrifying. You're one of 50 aldermen. I hope the other 49 listen to you and the mayor. Mr. Napolitano, thanks so much for coming on tonight. I appreciate it.NAPOLITANO: Thanks for having me, Tucker.CARLSON: Well, Major League Baseball started its season last week. That's the good news. The bad news is the coronavirus is already threatening to end it. Dr. Marc Siegel joins us after the break.Plus, we've talked to a New Jersey gym owner several times on the show. He defied the governor's orders. He said he was willing to face the consequences for that. This morning, he was arrested and handcuffed. He joins us after the break.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)CARLSON: The University of Notre Dame in Indiana announced today that it will no longer host a presidential debate this September. The University's President blamed the coronavirus quote, \"Health precautions would have greatly diminished the educational value of hosting the debate on our campus,\" end quote.Now it's possible that's the literal truth in the entire story. On the other hand, given that every major institution in American life opposes Donald Trump's reelection, maybe there's more to it.On the face of it, it does seem like an odd move. Schools usually fight to host debates. It's free advertising for them, Hofstra, Washington University in St. Louis, the chances are you've heard of those places because they hosted presidential debates.But Notre Dame says it doesn't want a debate because not enough students could attend it. Will other schools reach the same conclusion? If they do, could we wind up with an abbreviated number of presidential debates staged by remote on say Facebook or Zoom? Who knows? We don't know.We do know that would certainly help Joe Biden.Well, 11 players and two coaches of the Miami Marlins have tested positive for the coronavirus now. The outbreak comes less than a week after the league launched its short 60-game season. So what does this mean for the rest of the season?Fox News medical contributor, Dr. Marc Siegel joins us tonight with an answer to that question. Doctor, good to see you.DR. MARC SIEGEL, FOX NEWS CHANNEL MEDICAL CONTRIBUTOR: Tucker, in 1969 three things happened. You were born, a man landed on the moon and my miracle Mets won the World Series. And you know what? The American psyche, the national psyche, our spirit is tied into our national pastime baseball.All sports, all eyes are on Major League Baseball, and the problem tonight as you just said is several players on the Miami Marlins in a hotspot -- from a hotspot have tested positive.The problem is not with baseball itself, Tucker. Baseball is a sport that is socially distanced by definition. You're standing in the outfield. You're all alone. You're in the infield. You don't encounter anyone.The problem is that the way baseball is right now, everyone is playing in their home park. They're on the team buses. They're traveling together. They're eating at restaurants. They're sharing equipment. Equipment bags are being brought onto buses.Whereas the NBA and the NFL are doing bubble type techniques where they're playing in one place. NBA in Orlando, NHL -- National Hockey League in Edmonton and Toronto. Major League Baseball needs to survive this season to send a message to all sports. We need our sports. We need Major League Baseball.I want them to consider my prescription for Major League Baseball tonight, consider going to hubs. Consider going to cities and areas where there's not a lot of COVID-19 and not traveling as much and sticking together and not going around to as many restaurants and as many buses and as many planes.Let's restrict some of that and keep baseball going at all costs. Very important, Tucker.CARLSON: I think it is. All parts of this 250-year-old culture are important and that's certainly one of them. Dr. Siegel, thank you so much thanks.SIEGEL: Thanks, Tucker.CARLSON: So we've introduced you to the owners of the Atilus Gym in Bellmawr, New Jersey a couple of times on this show. This morning they were arrested. Why? For defying the state's mandatory shutdown orders. Those arrests come after a three-month standoff between the co-owner of the gym, Ian Smith and the governor of New Jersey, Phil Murphy, both of whom have been on the show.At one point, Smith removed the doors from the gym so the state couldn't keep them shut. Before reopening last May, he announced that he was willing to deal with the consequences of violating state law.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CARLSON: You're openly defying him on television. What do you think's going to happen to you when you do this?IAN SMITH, ATILUS GYM OWNER, BELLMAWR, NEW JERSEY: We're prepared for any and all consequences. Our actions on Monday are going to be grounded in the ideals of civil disobedience.(END VIDEO CLIP)CARLSON: He should have just set a Federal building on fire, screamed the right slogans, Ian Smith would be fine, but he didn't, and so he was arrested. He joins us tonight. Ian, good to see you. Tell us what happened.SMITH: Good evening, Tucker. So from the last time that we spoke, we had lost our newest case of contempt of court and that was on Friday of last week.The governor said that -- and requested in court to take extraordinary measures to stop us from operating a business and Judge Robert Lougy agreed with him. My partner and I had had the doors removed since Thursday and we had not left the building since. We had two weeks' worth of clothing and we were prepared to stay inside at all costs.But we did agree that we would go peacefully if law enforcement came. That time came this morning at about 5:10 this morning, when the County Sheriff walked in the building and said that we were under arrest.Frank and I at that point went peacefully, and when we arrived back after being booked, we had boarded up doors.CARLSON: I hoped the Sheriff was embarrassed. I assume, he was. There are murderers walking free, a lot of them in New Jersey tonight. Maybe they should do something real.You went on this show, you knew that that was wagging a finger in the face of the tyrants who run your state. You did it anyway. Why?SMITH: Because I'm not afraid of tyrants and no American should be, because we outnumber them greatly. And the only thing that they run off of is fear, which is why you see what you see in the media, where they're pumping fear into the coronavirus, when what they should be pumping is solutions.They don't do that. They don't ever offer any solutions. It's wear a mask, shut up and wait for a vaccine. That's not public health, and I won't subscribe to it.CARLSON: That's just the most moving thing I have heard in a long time, and I just want you to restate for our viewers who didn't see your last appearance on this show. How many infections of COVID-19 have been documented in your gym so far? Just to give our audience some sense of the public health threat that you pose.SMITH: At this point, we have record from June that we reopened and allowed visitors to our facility. We have over 13,000 visitors who have come to Atilus Gym in Bellmawr, and not a single case so far.Governor Murphy cannot say that about the long term care facilities that are 100 percent in his control that have been shut down since March and account for over 50 percent of the deaths in the state.CARLSON: Yes, so you pose a documented -- this is not speculation. The health authorities say you pose no threat at all, not one infection and you were handcuffed and arrested because you defied Governor Murphy.You're a brave man, Ian, and I'm grateful that you've come on the show and I hope you will keep us posted as to what happens next.SMITH: Just one more thing to end the night, Tucker, if I could. Governor Murphy asked us for 14 days to shut down -- 14 days today in New Jersey. It is day 132 of the shutdown. And I would just like everybody to think about that long and hard before they support his policies.CARLSON: Yes, once they get power, they never relinquish it. So as you know. Great to see you tonight. Thank you.SMITH: Good night, Tucker.CARLSON: Good night. So, here is the least controversial fact in social science. Children who are raised by two married parents perform much better in school, earn more as adults, much more likely to graduate, much less likely to become addicted to drugs or alcohol, far less likely to go to jail and are healthier.There are many benefits to growing up, in fact, in an intact nuclear family, but two parent households in this country are in steep decline.An update on the state of the American family is next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)CARLSON: One of the most outspokenly conservative professors in the United States died last week, there are not many. Mike Adams taught at the University of North Carolina, Wilmington. He was direct about his views. Adams opposed censorship and thought abortion was wrong.He believed in facts. He believed in historical record. Here's a clip of Adams describing what he thought of campus speech codes.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MIKE ADAMS, PROFESSOR, UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA, WILMINGTON: They consider this to be a political weapon for them to shut down speech that they can't rebut.I've got a definition by the way for hate speech, I think it's speech that the hate -- that the left hates because they lack the intelligence to rebut it.(END VIDEO CLIP)CARLSON: It is one thing for a talk show host to say that, but you can imagine the response when a Professor says it. For articulating his beliefs, Adams faced never ending harassment.After he criticized the tyrannical behavior of the Governor of North Carolina during the coronavirus shutdowns, thousands petitioned for his removal. And in the end, the mob won. The University of North Carolina, Wilmington forced Adams into early retirement. His last day would have been next week.Well, last week, Adams apparently shot himself. But it wasn't enough. The media continued to attack him. NBC News ran a piece entitled, \"Professor behind vile racist and sexist tweets found dead in north carolina home.\" That's real. BuzzFeed ran a story with this headline, quote, \"A Professor who was known for his racist, misogynistic tweets was found dead in his home.\"Imagine doing something like that, writing something like that about a dead man. They didn't think twice. That's who they are. That's what they'd do to you.Well, there's been a lot of research, longitudinal serious research over the decades, and it's very clear, it couldn't be clearer. Children raised by married parents vastly outperform children who weren't on every scale, on average. They're happier, healthier, more successful. They're paid more. They're not in jail. They graduate.So we should be very concerned about a new Senate report. It shows the demise of two parent households has accelerated dramatically in this country. One notable collapse is the percentage of young women who are married, that's dropped from 71 percent in 1962 to 42 percent in 2019.The result of this, people aren't getting married, but they're still having children. That means a massive uptick and out of wedlock births. Out of wedlock births rose from five percent of all births in 1960 to 40 percent of all births today.Heather Mac Donald is the author of \"The Diversity Delusion.\" She's studied these trends carefully, and we're happy to have her on the show tonight. So Heather, the first thing I noticed, and I think it's -- the science of this is so clear, I don't think there's even a debate about it.But I noticed that in affluent neighborhoods like the one I've spent a lot of my life living in, not one person will judge out of wedlock births, but there are no out of wedlock births. Everyone is married and has kids within marriage. What does that tell you?HEATHER MAC DONALD, MANHATTAN INSTITUTE: It tells you that the elites have lost faith in the bourgeois values that they practice, but they're not willing to articulate because they believe that somehow they're associated with white supremacy.We've been hearing a lot, Tucker, about this white privilege meme. That's a poisonous fiction. Here's the real class divide in this country, and sadly, it's also a race divide, the likelihood of growing up with two married parents.I'm going to break a massive feminist taboo here and say that males matter. That fathers matter. That fathers bring a set of values and norms to child rearing, whether it's self-reliance or self-discipline, honor and courage. On average, that complement what mothers can bring.CARLSON: Of course.MAC DONALD: And when you lose that symmetry, and that emotional support for children, that goes so far beyond economic support, which is largely irrelevant, it's the fact that you have twice as much kinship support and people that two parents can spell each other when one is exhausted. That's what results in successful children.And the anarchy that we've lived through with the looting and the rioting of the last month, Tucker, has been preceded by a more slow motion anarchy and breakdown, which is the breakdown of the family because our prisons today are filled almost exclusively with fatherless men.CARLSON: I can't think of any national politician who would say that. I mean, Barack Obama talked about fathers. I don't think he ever once mentioned marriage because unmarried mothers are a core constituency in his party, other than maybe I'm serious, Kanye West. I can't think of anybody who has ever said anything like that. Why?MAC DONALD: The feminists rule our discourse. You're not allowed to say that men matter. I mean, belief survivors believe that they live in a rape culture. I will say though, that before he was elected President, Barack Obama in 2008, gave a Father's Day speech from Chicago that I urge all your listeners, but I urge in particular, the so-called progressives to read, where he gave the facts that you started with, Tucker, about the much greater chance that fatherless boys ended up in prison, end up out of school, end up in gangs.Sadly, Obama did not act on that speech, and the Republicans have not been much better. Part of the problem is, is that so many of them, if they were married initially, are now divorced. So it's a hard thing to turn this around. But we have to because the breakdown of the family is the biggest civilizational catastrophe that we're facing today that is the root of the spiraling crime, insane drive-by shootings that we see in the inner city and the destruction of human potential.CARLSON: I couldn't agree more. The science is completely clear. And by the way, just because you're divorced doesn't disqualify you from telling the truth. If you drink too much, it doesn't mean you want your kids to be alcoholics.I mean, this -- the whole personalist political identity is everything is one of the dumbest ideas we've ever internalized that we have internalized.MAC DONALD: Yes.CARLSON: Heather Mac Donald, really one of our smartest guests ever. Great to see you. Thank you.MAC DONALD: Thanks, Tucker.CARLSON: So Greg Gutfeld, in addition to being a TV star has thought deeply about so-called cancel culture and how to defeat it. It's possible he just wrote a whole book about it. He's here to tell us what he's concluded, next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)CARLSON: So if you're Antifa, you can burn down a Federal building or storm a police station; but if you're you, the rules are different. Say one wrong thing and you're done. That's called cancel culture. Can we stop it?Fox's Greg Gutfeld has thought a lot about this. He has written a new book, \"The Plus: Self-Help for People Who Hate Self-Help.\" It comes out tomorrow. We're happy to have the great Greg Gutfeld on our show tonight.Greg, congrats on the book. What can we do ...GREG GUTFELD, FOX NEWS HOST: Thank you.CARLSON: ... to end -- to cancel, cancel culture?GUTFELD: Well, first I have to say that amazing gym owner was amazing.CARLSON: Amazing.GUTFELD: That beard. I could live in that beard. I could live like a little elf inside a little Keebler hole in his beard.Okay, I had to get that out of the way. Here's the deal with cancel culture.CARLSON: I don't want to think about that.GUTFELD: Yes, you should. Here's the thing about cancel culture. This is the first work around for the First Amendment in history. Because whenever you complain about cancel culture, they will say, you have the First Amendment, freedom of speech. We're just going to ruin your career and take your livelihood and drive you to suicide. So it actually makes the First Amendment meaningless.There's no way First Amendment can help you.CARLSON: Exactly.GUTFELD: So identified the problems, right? Cancel culture defines you at your worst. The past is always present. Something you did a long time ago doesn't matter. If you apologize, that's merely an appetizer, and the media becomes the amplifier for these deeds simply for clicks.So the solution which I have in my book, you need to make cancel culture costly, because right now it's too cheap to pull it off.CARLSON: Yes.GUTFELD: The low barrier for entry to join a mob is nil. So, the solution is to make it expensive and the key is to share the risk. If we stick together, and it's really easy. The price becomes too high for the mob. The only reason why they exist is because we don't stick together.We get scared. We hide. Companies will virtue signal rather than protect their employees. We often need to build in mutually assured destruction.The assumption that cancel culture could rebound on them destroys it. Remember that reporter that canceled the kid who donated all that money to the Children's Hospital? They found like an old tweet. Then like a week later, they found tweets of the reporter. He lost his job. It has to be like that.CARLSON: So you have to use -- I'm not sure I'm for that. I mean, there's no way to not use their tactics and beat them. It's just a disgusting one.GUTFELD: You could be nice.CARLSON: Yes.GUTFELD: It really is. I think there's a good positive part about this in terms of being \"The Plus.\" You should define people by their best intentions. You should everyday ask yourself if you are contributing to mob culture, especially on social media.Sometimes I'm guilty of it, especially if I drink a little wine. So I try to stay off. We tend to look at Twitter as an ex. We're trying to impress them, rather than looking at it as a harmful, unknown quality.The reason why Tucker Carlson is the happiest talk show host on Earth, is because he never sets foot on social media. I'm not even sure he knows how to turn on a computer. That's why he doesn't care.And one of the solutions to cancel culture is not giving a damn. The problem is, the culture can still care about you. You can't just turn off the weather. They can follow you everywhere.But I think that you have to share the risk, and everyday ask yourself, is there a way to help people who are in trouble?CARLSON: I think that's really wise advice and on your way out, I just -- this is for you, Greg Gutfeld. We have a picture of the beard.GUTFELD: Yes.CARLSON: You'd like to live inside. The rotted oak tree you'd like to tote your acorns to.GUTFELD: Do you know how cozy that would be?CARLSON: I can't believe it.GUTFELD: I'm all for cozy.CARLSON: I think we indulged that.GUTFELD: I am all for cozy.CARLSON: Unbelievable. Congrats on the book.GUTFELD: You endorsed it.CARLSON: I sort of.GUTFELD: Thank you, buddy.CARLSON: Great to see you. Well, there's been a lot happening in this country, international pandemics, trade wars, domestic upheaval have rocked this country in a way it hasn't been in a long time.Who is benefiting? China is benefiting? We will talk to someone who has thought a lot about how they're benefiting, next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)CARLSON: There is evidence including from Chinese scientists, the coronavirus began in a Chinese lab. The Chinese government certainly lied about its spread, then engaged in sketchy trade practices that destroyed millions of American manufacturing jobs.Fentanyl floods in from China. Hundreds of thousands of Americans have died from that.So China has caused havoc, are they benefiting from it? That's the question for Bill Hagerty. He is running for Senate in Tennessee. He's in the middle of a tough primary. This segment has nothing to do with that.We've asked to talk to Mr. Hagerty because it was knowledge of Asia. He served as the U.S. Ambassador to Japan and we're happy to have him on tonight. Mr. Hagerty, thanks so much for coming on.So the concern would be that after all the problems we've dealt with, thanks to China, they are taking advantage of our weakness to increase their advantage. Do you think that's happening?BILL HAGERTY (R), FORMER U.S. AMBASSADOR TO JAPAN: Absolutely, Tucker. I know that that's the case. That's one of the key reasons that President Trump has endorsed me for the United States Senate. He knows that he needs an ally that understands the scene in China up close and personal. I've dealt with them. We've got to deal with China strictly and toughly.CARLSON: The fentanyl question is one that baffles me. So hundreds of thousands of Americans have died from ODs, far more than have died from COVID-19.HAGERTY: Indeed.CARLSON: That's chemicals coming from China primarily. Nobody ever says that. Why?HAGERTY: We should be saying it. President Trump negotiated in Buenos Aires to stop this with the Chinese Premier. They haven't. Again, we need to stand up strong to deal with this.They're killing Americans. They're sending the material over to Mexico. It's coming across a very porous border. We've got to stand with President Trump to seal the border to secure it to stop the lawlessness and in this drug trade.CARLSON: Does it seem like tensions between the U.S. and China are escalating to a new level? There are signs, consulates closing, et cetera, that they are.HAGERTY: Yes.CARLSON: Are they?HAGERTY: Indeed, indeed, Tucker and as U.S. Ambassador, to Japan, I've seen it up close. They've advanced on us militarily. The minute we step back in the South China Sea, they advanced their forces. That's why President Trump has sent two aircraft carrier groups out that direction.We've got to stand up to them militarily. Diplomatically, you've seen what they've done. They overtook the World Health Organization. I applaud President Trump for taking us out of that group.And economically, they've been a predator for years. We've seen Presidents both Democrat and Republican look the other way as they continued to mount their aggression.They've taken our jobs. They've destroyed our economy with this pandemic, and they've killed over 150,000 Americans. They need to be held to account and I look forward to serving to help do that.CARLSON: Bill Hagerty, I appreciate it. Thanks for coming on tonight. Former U.S. ambassador to Japan.HAGERTY: Thank you so much, Tucker. Great to be with you.CARLSON: Thank you very much. So many things going on right now that it's almost impossible to keep track of all of them.We spend an inordinate amount of time we think it is worth it, but covering the chaos in our streets, but that doesn't mean there isn't a lot happening behind it.And so we're going to make every effort this week and going forward not to let stories fall through the cracks that really matter.In the meantime, we'll be back tomorrow night at eight. The show that is the sworn enemy of lying, pomposity, smugness and groupthink. We mean it.Have a great night with the ones you love.Now, it is time for Sean Hannity from New York.", "comment": "", "topic": "TRANSCRIPT", "date": " July 27"}, {"cover": "https://a57.foxnews.com/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/694940094001/717e6dc8-1bab-42d1-abb7-01984cd08333/8476f472-a4dc-49b6-8e69-218c35b8f340/1280x720/match/156/88/image.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "title": "Christian Whiton: Trump's reelection prospects \u2014 7 reasons why he'll likely see a second term", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/christian-whiton-trumps-reelection-prospects-7-reasons-why-hell-likely-see-a-second-term", "subtitle": "Left-wing pundits are confidently predicting the Trump defeat for which they have lusted, but they are likely wrong.", "keyword": "presidential election and trade war", "website": "Fox News", "author": "", "content": "You\u2019ve seen the crowing by left-wing pundits. Relying on polls that show President  trailing former Vice President , they confidently predict the Trump defeat for which they have lusted these past four years.They are likely wrong. of all, most polls are wrong. Many were wrong in 2016,\u00a0and they will likely\u00a0be proven\u00a0wrong again. In any given poll, all it takes to skew results is a few respondents who don\u2019t want to tell a stranger on the phone that they  Trump. This dynamic is likely greater now than in 2016 given the McCarthyite atmosphere progressives have created in which supporting Trump can be hazardous to one\u2019s social standing, career\u00a0and even physical safety., the presidential campaign hasn\u2019t really started yet. This may come as news to people who follow politics and for whom it seems the 2016 campaign never really ended. But most Americans simply don\u2019t pay serious attention to the campaign until after Labor Day., the biggest issue in the campaign will be jobs and economy. Biden and most other Democrats are on the side of keeping the economy and schools closed. He has also endorsed massive tax hikes, which most voters understand will kills jobs and the economic recovery.Trump, in contrast, has urged reopening businesses and schools and arranged for the mass production of coronavirus vaccines so they are available right when they are approved, hopefully beginning in October. Plus Trump, unlike Biden, already has one economic boom under his belt., the new coalition Trump assembled in 2016 remains intact. His breakthrough was attracting lower-income voters who previously voted Democrat but felt betrayed by the elite. He also energized conservatives with promises to appoint constitutionalist judges.As a result, Trump flipped traditionally Democratic Pennsylvania, Michigan\u00a0and Wisconsin to the Republican column and held swing states like Ohio and Florida. No part of the this coalition has soured on Trump. Democrat-run cities in chaos may also help him win back the suburbs., Trump is tough on China and Biden is not. Americans are well aware that the virus that has cut short nearly 150,000 American lives came from China, abetted by the malfeasance of the ruling Chinese Communist Party. Trump has raised tariffs on more than half of goods from China and reoriented the U.S. military to deter China as its primary mission.Joe Biden was second in command of an administration that appeased China and mistreated key allies like Taiwan. He opposes Trump\u2019s tariffs on China. His son mysteriously raised large sums of money from China and Biden himself was the chief advocate of letting China in to the World Trade Organization \u2014\u00a0the key enabling step of robbing America of industry and crushing the middle class., the Trump campaign organization finally has its game on. A rule of thumb is that campaigns run by wannabe celebrity managers are likely to lose. By installing Bill Stepien as campaign manager last week, Trump has the opposite of this type of person running his reelection effort. The campaign is ahead of Biden in fundraising, and just this week raised an unprecedented $20 million in a single virtual event that drew 300,000 donors who gave an average of $67.Biden remains largely sequestered in his basement, avoiding most media. The Democrats have all but canceled their convention, opting for a mostly digital confab. In contrast, Trump will accept his party\u2019s nomination on Aug.\u00a027\u00a0before thousands of cheering Republican delegates in Jacksonville, Fla., marking the real beginning of the campaign and a likely string of high energy rallies.Biden, whose campaign and debate performances were pathetic before panicked Democrats coalesced behind him to deprive Bernie Sanders of the nomination, cannot match this performance., the Democrats have gone nuts. While the media loves to spotlight any disapproval of Trump by a fellow Republican, the real political crisis in America in on the Left. Centrist, economic liberals are being shouted down and defeated in primaries by far-left woke activists who support the Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez wing of the party and cancel culture.The British Labour Party underwent a similar transformation to the woke Left before being nearly annihilated at polls last December. Americans aren\u2019t any more likely than Brits to want to be governed by elitists who in our country falsely accuse them of racism, side with the Antifa-Black Lives Matter mob against cops, and nod at those attempting to censor or fire Americans who defend meritocracy against the racial obsession and cancel culture that now dominates the Left.Lacking moral courage, many congressional Republicans have been slow to defend against this threat to freedom. Trump doesn\u2019t have that problem, and since his July 3rd speech at Mount Rushmore, in which he defended American history, has made it clear he is the bodyguard Americans need to stop the woke mob.As in 2016, Donald Trump in 2020 and the political and economic factors afoot defy conventional analysis.

The U.S. adds a record number of jobs but also sees record numbers of new coronavirus cases. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: This is the largest monthly jobs gain in history. EMANUEL: The president takes a victory lap as the U.S. gains back millions of jobs. But his 2020 rival says it's too soon to declare victory. JOE BIDEN, PRESUMPTIVE DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: We're still down nearly 15 million jobs, and the pandemic is getting worse, not better. EMANUEL: Even as markets rebound and consumer confidence rises, states with hot spots are pulling back, and enhanced unemployment benefits could end within weeks. We'll talk with labor secretary and coronavirus task force member, Eugene Scalia, about whether more stimulus is needed. It's a \"FOX News Sunday\" exclusive. Then -- DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, WHITE HOUSE CORONAVIRUS TASK FORCE MEMBER: The numbers speak for themselves. EMANUEL: -- as officials warn Americans to avoid crowds this holiday weekend, four out of five states see coronavirus spikes. We'll talk with Dr. Ashish Jha, director of the Harvard Global Health Institute, about how leaders can slow the surge and what's ahead for work and school this fall. Plus confusion over when the president knew about reports Russia put bounties on American troops. TRUMP: Intelligence people didn't even -- many of them didn't believe it happened at all. EMANUEL: We'll talk live with Senator Jack Reed, top Democrat on the Armed Services Committee, about bipartisan pressure for an explanation. And the president's fiery rhetoric on statues and cancel culture. TRUMP: Our nation is witnessing a merciless campaign to wipe out our history. EMANUEL: We'll ask our Sunday panel about the politics of embracing the past. All, right now, on \"FOX News Sunday\". (END VIDEOTAPE) EMANUEL: And hello again on this Independence Day weekend from FOX News in Washington. Americans face yet more uncertainty as the number of coronavirus infections hits new highs. Some states are pumping the brakes on reopening and many July 4th celebrations were scaled back. This comes as the Labor Department reports the U.S. added 4.8 million jobs last month and as the president heats up his rhetoric over how to frame our nation's past leaders. In a moment, we'll talk with Labor Secretary Eugene Scalia. But, first, Mark Meredith joins us live from the White House with the latest -- Mark. MARK MEREDITH, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Mike, President Trump invited friends, family and first responders to the White House last night for the Fourth of July celebration while in other cities because COVID cases are surging, celebrations were canceled to help slow the spread. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MEREDITH: President Trump celebrated Independence Day by watching a dazzling flyover showcasing America's military might. But in his prepared remarks, a more somber tone. TRUMP: We are now in the process of defeating the radical left, the Marxists, the anarchists of the agitators, the looters, and people who in many instances have absolutely no clue what they are doing. MEREDITH: White House guests were encouraged but not required to wear masks or social distance. The speech echoed the president's fiery rhetoric a day earlier at Mount Rushmore. While Joe Biden says Americans should embrace the debate over racial injustice. BIDEN: It's past time to fully confront systemic racism and our growing economic inequity to deal with the denial of our nation's promise. MEREDITH: Protests continued throughout the weekend, and in Baltimore, demonstrators toppled a statue of Christopher Columbus. Meantime, there were plenty of fireworks on Capitol Hill last week as lawmakers demanded answers over reports Russia offered bounties to militants to target U.S. troops in Afghanistan. Democrats accused President Trump of ignoring the issue. REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA), SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE: He should spend more time reading the daily presidential brief than planning military parades. MEREDITH: The White House continues to celebrate the latest jobs report with the Labor Department reporting 4.8 million jobs added in June, a potential sign the economy is bouncing back from its pandemic lows. (END VIDEOTAPE) MEREDITH: The president says he's open to another round of direct payments and help for small businesses, but lawmakers remain split, Mike, about how to move forward with this potential next stimulus bill -- Mike. EMANUEL: Mark Meredith reporting from the White House -- Mark, thanks very much. MEREDITH: You bet. EMANUEL: Joining me now, secretary of labor and White House coronavirus task force member, Eugene Scalia. Mr. Secretary, welcome to \"FOX News Sunday.\" EUGENE SCALIA, SECRETARY OF LABOR: Mike, thanks for having me. EMANUEL: Forty percent of the job growth in June of what was a huge jobs report was in leisure and hospitality, which includes restaurants and bars, but now, in some of those COVID hot spots states, those businesses are being restricted once again. How is that going to impact our economic growth? SCALIA: Well, Mike, it was an extraordinary jobs report as you said. We added nearly 5 million jobs in June. Projections have been that we might add around 3 million, so we did extremely well. And across industrial sectors -- for example, we saw a really big gains in manufacturing, saw gains in construction, and we saw gains across really nearly all demographic groups. It was a terrific month. But yes, we have new cases. We have to keep an eye on that. I believe that we can continue to reopen our workplaces safely. Our workplaces can be very safe places today but there are precautions that the president, vice president have underscored and those do remain important. We've gotten a reminder of that over the last couple of weeks. EMANUEL: Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell warned Congress this week that unless the viruses brought under control, the nation's economic outlook is extremely uncertain. So, while the latest jobs report was very, very strong, how much does that concern you about the future? SCALIA: Well, yes, the Federal Reserve chair expressed some concerns, but I think it's really important to again remember how much better than projected we've done so far. Back in May, it was projected that we would lose 7.5 million jobs. Well, we've now over the last couple of months added 7.5 million jobs. In other words, we're about 15 million ahead of what the experts that we were going to do. We're doing very well. We do need to be careful about the virus, but I am just optimistic among other reasons because USMCA went into effect last week. We finally put NAFTA to rest. This was something that was so important to the president. USMCA will be another source of stimulus, job growth to the country. So, there will be talk as we get deeper into the month about possible additional measures but I am optimistic, as I know the president is, about how we're reopening, the success we're having right now rebuilding that really extraordinary economy that we have through February until the virus came. EMANUEL: Last week, spending dropped, according to JPMorgan Chase, according to credit card customer data. Isn't this summer vacation season when people are supposed to be outspending, isn't that the driving force of GDP? SCALIA: Well, overall, spending, retail spending, consumer spending generally, new home starts, all of these have been actually very encouraging economic indicators over the last about six weeks or so, so I think when you did pass the job numbers, look at other economic indicators, Mike, actually, it's encouraging on that front too. Now, you know, that doesn't mean that we should rest content -- we know that there remain many Americans still out of work. We want to help them get back to work. That's why the president is talking about potentially additional tax cuts. You know, it was the president's tax cuts, it was his elimination of unnecessary, burdensome regulations that delivered that amazing economy we had before the virus struck. And so, I think additional measures around those lines do warrant discussion as we continue to move forward this month. EMANUEL: Do you see a V-shaped recovery going into the fall, sir? SCALIA: Those that the indications that we see. We again have just been doing so much better over the last two months now than was being projected. And -- and again, when you look at some of the more micro data, very strong indications there as well, but that said, it is going to be important, as you're noting, that people take social distancing seriously, wear masks in circumstances often where they're not able to social distance and the like. We can reopen safely, we can reopen while the virus is still there, but it will get more challenging if people don't take that seriously. EMANUEL: Speaking of that, on COVID-19, since you are a member of the coronavirus task force, new cases in the U.S. hit the largest single day total on Friday, 57,497. And new coronavirus cases on the rise in nearly 40 states, plus Mississippi, Tennessee, Texas, Nevada, and Arizona all sitting records for hospitalizations on Thursday. Looking at the rising cases in these states, did they move too soon or too fast? SCALIA: We knew that as people came out of their homes, emerged from their basements and the like, we knew that cases would go up. We are far, far better prepared to deal with those cases now than we were just a few months ago. We've got a much better understanding of how to treat the virus. We have the equipment, the hospital beds now to deal with the situation. So, this is something that we can manage, but part of managing it, as I've been emphasizing, individual responsibility as well. So we are positioned to deal with these challenges, but we again will have to take them seriously and the task force is certainly focused on delivering aid to these locations as the cases increase. The CDC, the Department of Health and Human Services are dispatching personnel, expertise and equipment where they're needed. EMANUEL: In terms of economic growth, President Trump is talking about what he would like from Congress in the next COVID relief package. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) INTERVIEWER: Let me start with phase four and what might potentially come later this month. Another direct round of payments for individuals -- do support that at this time? DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I do. I support it, but it has to be done properly and I support actually larger numbers than the Democrats. (END VIDEO CLIP) EMANUEL: Mr. Secretary, do you expect a deal shortly after lawmakers return from Independence Day holiday? SCALIA: I think there are going be a lot of discussions toward the end of the month about what additional -- additional measures may be needed. The president moved so swiftly and so effectively to get bipartisan relief with Congress back in March. That was those direct payments. It was the Paycheck Protection Program, which I think has been really an essential part of the recovery we're experiencing right now. And it was also a very substantial on employment benefit that the president put in place in March. So we did a very good job I think back in March positioning ourselves for this reopening and I think the American people can be confident that the president is going to take a careful look again at what further measures may be needed now. EMANUEL: Speaking of that, the president has also been clear about wanting a payroll tax cut. There's been resistance to that on Capitol Hill with some Republican senators being pretty blunt in saying they are not in favor. Are you prepared to give Democrats an unemployment insurance extension to get the payroll tax cut? SCALIA: Well, I think the payroll tax cut is -- could be an important part of, among other things, bringing Americans back to work and fueling job growth in the country. It was the tax cuts, as I mentioned, the president put in place that had a much stronger economy back in February than people were projecting, and I think that we should listen to the president's views on this as we move forward. In terms of the unemployment benefit, it was a really important thing to do as we were shutting our economy down, Americans across the country were basically being told -- and we needed to take measures, but they were basically being told you can't go to work right now. And so, we needed that substantial unemployment benefit. But, you know, there are some states where you can get on an annual basis, $75,000 a year right now on unemployment. And I think as we reopen the economy, I don't know that we need a benefit like that. During the so-called Great Recession 10, 12 years ago when we had a downturn, the added federal unemployment benefit was $25 a week. And what we did in the CARES Act was $600 a week. So, I think this is something we'll get a look at, but I don't think we need that $600 benefit going forward. EMANUEL: Mr. Secretary, finally, I ask this with great sensitivity since I missed my own father every day. The president has spoken this weekend defending statues in this country, including announcing he'd like to include a statue of your late father, Justice Antonin Scalia, in the new National Garden. What would that mean to your family, sir? SCALIA: Well, it's -- it would mean a lot. I -- I didn't see that one coming, Mike, and it was really touching to hear. I hope it would mean a lot to the American people, too. We need heroes. We need to admire our forbearers and recognize what is great and good in our past. And that is what the president is emphasizing right now. As we were reminded yesterday, we are nation conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal. No other nation can claim such an inspiring founding, so many great forbearers, and I certainly was touched to hear my father included on the kind of a list. EMANUEL: Mr. Secretary, thank you. Thanks for your time on this holiday weekend. Please come back. SCALIA: OK. Thanks so much, Mike. EMANUEL: Up next, states face tough choices as coronavirus cases increase across the country. We'll bring in a global public health expert to discuss what leaders can do to slow the surge next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) EMANUEL: This week, the U.S. hit a record for a single day spike in new COVID-19 cases leading into the Fourth of July. Even as many Americans dialed back their holiday plans, health officials are eyeing trends as we head into the fall and as states continue to reopen. Joining me now, the Director of the Harvard Global Health Institute, Dr. Ashish Jha. Dr. Jha, welcome to \"FOX News Sunday\". DR. ASHISH JHA, DIRECTOR, HARVARD GLOBAL HEALTH INSTITUTE: Thanks for having me on. Good morning. EMANUEL: Doctor, at least 20 states set record highs for average of new cases over seven days with Florida, Texas, California, Arizona, Georgia, and North Carolina tallying the highest number of new infections. Where are we in this COVID-19 fight and how do you explain the surge in new patients? JHA: Yes, so we're -- we're in a pretty tough spot right now. We have large outbreaks happening in large parts of our country. About two-thirds of the country is seeing increases in cases and we got here, Mike, because of a couple of reasons. One is I think we opened up a little too early in some places. A lot of states didn't meet the White House's own guidelines for when to open up safely. We didn't have the kind of testing and tracing infrastructure that we needed. And then last but not least, there's been a lot of mixed messaging on masks and social distancing and so all that has contributed to what I think is a perilous moment for our country. EMANUEL: According to The New York Times, new cases over the past 14 days are up 89 percent, while people dying is down 19 percent. Doctor, is that what you're seeing and how do you explain it? JHA: Yes, so what we know and this all -- first of all, it's always good news to see fewer people dying, right, and there are a couple of things that explain this. First of all, death is always a lagging indicator. By the time -- between the time somebody gets infected and takes a couple weeks before they get hospitalized and get really sick and another week or 10 days before they die. So death comes later. And I think a few things explain this. One is we are seeing increases in hospitalizations, so I worry that we are going to see an increase in deaths. Second is we're getting better at treating the disease. So we may have somebody who spends two or three weeks in the ICU and walks out, they're still going to be pretty sick with a lot of suffering but they're less likely to die. So I think it's a bunch of factors. Of course, the third is a younger population, which we know is less likely to die from this disease. So a combination of age, better treatment and the lagging indicator. EMANUEL: Any signs of COVID-19 weakening perhaps? JHA: There's a lot -- there's always talk about mutations and is a strain getting more virulent, less virulent, so far not really. No evidence that the virus is getting any less lethal. Thankfully no evidence it's getting any more lethal. But I do think doctors and nurses are getting better at treating it and we're getting some new therapies and that's helping. EMANUEL: Dr. Anthony Fauci painted a pretty dire picture this week on Capitol Hill. (BEGIN CLIP) DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES: We are now having 40 plus thousand new cases a day. I would not be surprised if we go up to 100,000 a day if this does not turn around. And so I am very concerned. (END CLIP) EMANUEL: Doctor, do you think it's that bad? JHA: Mike, you know, when he said that last week we were at about 40,000 per day, we are in the 50s now and heading in the wrong direction. So are we going to get to 100,000? It depends on us, right? If we act smartly, and we know what to do to prevent that -- if we do those things, yes, I think we can avoid it, but if we don't and kind of let this go the way we're going, I think 100,000 is entirely possible and that's what we have to avoid. EMANUEL: Stunning. In places where there are spikes, do you think they have to close down again? JHA: Well, you know, look, shelter in place, shutting down the economy, should absolutely be the last thing that you want to get to. And so you want to be aggressive on this and ahead of it. I am very worried as I look at data from parts of Texas and parts of Florida and Arizona that unless they get very aggressive, I don't really see how you stop the increases in this virus. I think some places are heading there and I think we're sounding the alarm because none of us want to go back to a shutdown. That's what we want to avoid. EMANUEL: Looking at the images of the president out at Mount Rushmore, a spectacular venue for the Independence Day holiday, with masks optional and no social distancing. Was that a mistake? JHA: Those are just risky things. Like any large gathering where people are not socially distancing and not wearing a mask is risky. Outdoors is better than indoors, so I was happy to see that, but my take is, the president should stick with the science here, encourage people to wear masks, you can build in a bit of social distancing. It would have made that safer. So this is just about risk management and I'm perplexed why we're not doing the things we can do pretty easily to lower the risk. EMANUEL: Every parent in America wants to know about schools reopening in the fall. You've talked about restricting bars, gyms, maybe even restaurants. Is that really the trade-off communities across the country must make? JHA: Yes, look, I am deeply worried about this. I have (ph) three kids who go to school and the last four months of them being out of school was pretty tough. I'm sure parents around the country are feeling that. And my point on this is if you -- if we see large outbreaks happening across communities, it's going to be very hard to keep schools open. The good news is we think kids transmit less. They are certainly less likely to get sick but if I -- imagine Arizona right now. If schools were open right now, they would not be able to stay open. So the number one task I think of governors around the country is get the virus under control or we're going to have schools shut down for many, many months this fall. And, obviously, none of us want that that. EMANUEL: What does school in the fall look like for much of the country? Are children of all ages going to be wearing masks all day? Is it realistic for first and second graders to keep a mask on all day? And how are teachers and students going to understand each other with masks on their faces? JHA: Yes, so that's a great question. Obviously schools range from kindergarten all the way through seniors in high school who are essentially adults. I think high schools, middle schools it's going to be easier, hopefully, to get kids to put on masks and keep them on. It's obviously going to get harder in elementary school. I think we're just going to have to make some trade-offs. My take is if you're in a community without a large outbreak, with low number of cases, you can probably get away without the little ones wearing a mask. We have got to also think about the fact that it's not just kids, our teachers and staff there. You can't run a school without teachers and staff so you got to protect everybody. It's going to be a challenge, but the single biggest thing that will help us out is if we keep the virus in the community at a low level. EMANUEL: The question everyone I know is asking, how optimistic are you that there will be drug therapies for COVID-19 and a vaccine in the coming months? JHA: Yes, so we've got two drugs that seem to work. They're both really for people who are pretty sick, Remdesivir and Dexamethasone. So these are for hospitalized patients who have substantial lung issues and evolvement (ph) already. Am I optimistic we're going to get an oral therapy that you can just take when you get sick? I'm not super -- look, a lot of clinical trials going on, I would love to be wrong. But the history of antiviral therapy is not a glorious one. We just have not been able to come up with oral drugs that will work super well. Vaccines I am very optimistic we're going to have one in early 2021. The challenge here, Mike, is that there are seven plus billion people in the world and there is going to be a race to vaccinate everybody. We're going to need billions of doses and I'm very worried about supply chains, about having enough vials and syringes and all the stuff. So I suspect spring to summer of 2021 before everybody's going to be able to get vaccinated in the United States. EMANUEL: And how effective would a vaccine be? Do you expect a vaccine that would work with just about everybody or are we talking about a limited percentage of success? JHA: Yes, that's a great question. Look, the good news here is we've got a ton of vaccine candidates, over 100. We've got more than a dozen in clinical trials. I'm guessing here, but my best guess is we won't have one vaccine, we'll have multiple vaccines that work. My best guess is that we'll have -- probably China might get to it first with a vaccine later this fall, but we're also racing, the Europeans are and my hope is that we'll have a vaccine that will at least stop you from getting very sick from the virus. So you may still get a mild -- you still might get mild disease but you won't get very sick. Also maybe the kind of vaccine where we need to get one every year. But that's fine. I get my flu shot every year. If I have to get a COVID shot every year, that's fine. EMANUEL: Dr. Jha, thank you. Thanks for your time. Please come back. JHA: My pleasure. Thanks for having me on. EMANUEL: Up next, the White House faces new pressure to explain when the president was told Russians may have offered money to Afghan militants to kill U.S. troops. We will speak to the leading Democrat on the Armed Services Committee when we come back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) EMANUEL: Coming up, President Trump cast doubt on allegations that Russians put bounties on U.S. troops in Afghanistan. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: I think it's a host for the newspapers and the Democrats. If it did happen, the Russians would hear about it and anybody else would hear about it, that was involved. (END VIDEO CLIP) EMANUEL: We'll ask Senator Jack Reed about the intelligence and the U.S. response, next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) EMANUEL: There was bipartisan outcry this week over reports rush offered bounties to Afghan militants to target U.S. troops. The administration says the intelligence is debatable. My next guest is pressing for cabinet officials to testify. Joining us now from Rhode Island, Democratic Senator Jack Reed, a former Army Ranger and the ranking member of the Armed Services Committee. Senator, welcome back to FOX NEWS SUNDAY. SEN. JACK REED (D-RI): Thanks, Mike. EMANUEL: Classified briefings at the end of this week about the possibility of Russian bounties on U.S. troops in Afghanistan. Reports are the administration is not planning to take any action in response. How concerned are you and what would you do to advise them to, you know, take action? REED: Well, I'm very concerned. And this is based upon just the public reports. If there's credible evidence that Russia is trying to entice Afghanis to kill American servicemen, that is a serious issue. Involvement of Russia in Afghanistan with the purpose of trying to kill individuals, American soldiers, is something that can't be accepted. It should have gone to the president. He should have been aware of it. In fact, there's some indication that it was in his presidential decision brief in the early part of the year, but he did not read it or did not pay attention to it. But that's the type of information that has to be seized by the president, because he's at the intersection of all the different roads of intelligence that come together. And, also, he's the one that's talking to Putin. He's had five or six conversations with Putin. And if this is an issue at all, even if it's one you just want to warn him away from not even thinking about, that discussion might have been very useful. EMANUEL: Republicans like your college Senator Joni Ernst of Iowa say leading Democrats, quote, had access to that same sort of information months ago, so what's the big deal? Is this a failure across our government, sir? REED: I -- it's not a failure across the government. The way the information is structured in terms of the presentation is first the president, as you would expect, every day gets a daily briefing, which is the most sensitive information that the intelligence community can come together. One of the things we've heard about President Trump is that he seldom reads them every day, maybe once a day, maybe once every three or four days, so there's, I think, a gap that has to be filled. And then there's another level of information, highly classified information, that goes to the big eight. Those are the -- the ranking Democrats. But the rank and file Democrats and rank and file Republicans don't typically get access to these kinds of very, very highly sensitive reports. EMANUEL: President Trump is threatening to veto the bipartisan National Defense Authorization Act over renaming military installations that bear confederate names. As a former Army Ranger who served it Fort Benning and Fort Bragg, what about this name issue? REED: I think we've finally come to grips with our history and we've come to grips with it in the appropriate way. This was a bipartisan initiative. It came out of the Armed Services Committee on a bipartisan basis. It wasn't a Republican initiative or Democratic initiative. It was supported by the committee by and large with very few exceptions. And it's coming to the floor of the Senate as a bipartisan initiative. And I think what it recognizes is that these individuals defied their country, abandoned their uniform, and fought against the United States of America. And to later on, and in many cases it was 50 or 60 years later, to name a post after these individuals does not represent what I think should be consistent with our, you know, honoring of American military heroes. The -- the factor, I think, that is important today is when you look at a post in the United States military, it is composed of men and women, it's composed of Americans of all different races. It cannot be named, I think, for someone who basically pledged his service to a system that was based on slavery. That has to be changed. And it will. It's a three-year process. At the end of those three years, with local import, with military import, with historic input, we will have a name, I think, that is much more fitting for the institution and for the history of the country. EMANUEL: As the ranking Democrat on the Armed Services Committee, what's the big picture impact if the president vetoes the defense authorization? REED: It would be reckless. He would be abandoning the -- the welfare of the troops, their pay raises, their quality living, the -- the housing improvements we've made, the platforms that they need, the -- the -- literally the ammunition that they'll need. All of it for not an issue that I think is comparable and indeed an issue which is being advanced on a bipartisan basis. This is not an example of the -- the -- the president responding to the cries of the entire country and -- and helping save us from ourselves. I mean when you have situations where the -- the assembly in the state of Mississippi chooses to recommend the elimination of the confederate battle flag, that show something about where the country is headed. And the president does not want to go and lead the country. He wants to pull them back. And that's wrong. EMANUEL: The Supreme Court's about to wrap its term. As always, there is speculation about possible retirements. What would be the impact of one or possibly even two retirements in this political season? REED: Well, first of all, I think a -- a justice that would retire for such a transparently political reason would have to think twice, I would hope. Second, it would be the height of hypocrisy if Mitch McConnell tried to drive a nomination through within a few months when he refused to allow Merrick Garland's nomination to come up for over a year when President Obama made the appointment. So I think what's -- and I think the court, because it should represent -- regard its reputation as paramount, I think they would be not particularly wise if they chose to do that and nor would Senator McConnell be, I think, appropriate in trying to ram through a nomination at this point. EMANUEL: Does President Trump have the right to fill one or more Supreme Court seats, particularly if they are conservative justices in this election year? REED: Again, I think it looks on precedent where you have a situation where President Obama certainly had the same constitutional right as President Trump and yet the -- Leader McConnell said, no, I'm not going to let you get your nominee up. So in terms of rights and responsibilities, they're the same. But I think what we have to recognize is, you know, what's fair, what's most deserving of the American people? I don't think they want to see a slapdash nomination of a Supreme Court justice in a few weeks. And I -- again, I think the court themselves, these justices, are extraordinarily eminent personalities. They've dedicated themselves to the law. And their last act to be something of looking like a political expedience is something I don't think that would be favorably viewed by history or by -- by their colleagues. EMANUEL: What can your side do to stop the president if he wants to go forward other than perhaps taking it to the American people, and what does that do to the already heated 2020 race? REED: Again, there are the constitutional provisions that if a seat is vacant on the court, the president has the right to do that. The Senate considers it. That's all there. Those are the mechanics. The reality, the substance is, this is close to an election. The American people want to go ahead and make decisions about their future, including the -- the future of their courts. And I think they should be allowed to do that. This is about letting America speak, not letting people who are conveniently located in the process to exercise their will. Let -- this is about the Americans speaking. EMANUEL: Senator Reed, how are you feeling about the Senate races this fall? Do you see perhaps Democrats taking back the majority in the Senate and perhaps you becoming the chairman of the Armed Services Committee? REED: Well, I feel very good. I think we have extraordinary candidates and I think they are working very hard. And I think one of the problems that my colleagues in the Republican side, and particularly the president, is that we see a situation where the Covid virus is not being effectively dealt with. It's causing huge economic problems. So you have a combination of a pandemic and economic disarray that is affecting every American. And I think, again, people want to see common sense solutions. And what we have seen from the White House has not been the kind of consistent, thoughtful use of the powers the president has. The powers initially to use the Defense Production Act to buy protective equipment so that all of our health care workers would be protected without excessive cost and without excessive delay. We haven't yet seen an aggressive testing program so that we can test throughout the United States so people feel confident that they know they don't have it, nor does anyone else they're likely to see. We've got a whole issue that we have to do in terms of making sure we can go back to school in the fall. I know you're talking to the expert from Harvard Medical School. That's going to be a real, serious challenge. We have to, right now, provide more resources, I believe, for our local schools and local states so that we can get children back to school. And if you don't have kids back in school, you don't have workers back in the workplace because who is going to take care of their children? None of this is being dealt with on a comprehensive, coordinated way. And that has been the situation since the very beginning. EMANUEL: All right. REED: The president has tried to ignore the problem. The president dismissed it. The president went out for his Fourth of July speech, who I think there's one phrase about Covid, when, in fact, Covid is probably -- and the economy are probably the two greatest issues. EMANUEL: Senator Reed, thank you. Thanks for your time. REED: Thanks, Mike. EMANUEL: Always good to speak with you. See you soon back on The Hill. REED: Likewise. Thank you. EMANUEL: Up next we'll bring in our Sunday group on the president's tough rhetoric over historical statues and the state of play in the 2020 campaign. We'll discuss when we come back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: There is a new, far left fascism that demands absolute allegiance if you do not speak his language, perform its rituals, recite its mantras and follow its commandments, then you will be censored, banished, blacklisted, persecuted and punished. (END VIDEO CLIP) EMANUEL: President Trump delivers a passionate and fiery speech Friday night, marking Independence Day at Mount Rushmore. And it's time now for our Sunday group. Former Republican Congressman Jason Chaffetz, Susan Page of \"USA Today,\" and Charles Hurt of \"The Washington Times.\" Panel, welcome. JASON CHAFFETZ: Good morning. CHARLES HURT, \"THE WASHINGTON TIMES\" AND FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Thank you. EMANUEL: Charlie, that sounded targeted at the president's base for months ahead of Election Day. Is it effective? HURT: I think it is because, you know, everyone is talking about try -- you know, whether the president wants to drag people back to history. It's really not about that. It's -- it's about freedom of speech. It's about the fact that people are being shut down in this environment. It's about people marauding in the streets and tearing down statues and doing it without going through any sort of legal process. And -- and people -- lawful, peaceful people sitting at home are watching this happen and -- and they have no voice. And so -- so it -- it really -- it goes much farther than just celebrating or -- or acknowledging our past, acknowledging a history. It has to do with upholding the rule of law and the concept -- the very principles and concepts that were -- were enshrined in the Constitution by these people that we choose to venerate and -- and -- and now we're watching their statues getting torn down. I think it's a very powerful thing. EMANUEL: Susan, what about reaching the political center? Does in the president need to broaden, expand his support in the closing months? SUSAN PAGE, WASHINGTON BUREAU CHIEF, \"USA TODAY\": Yes, you know, the -- I think -- I think Charlie's right, that this helps him with his base, which is so solidly for President Trump. But that does not get him to a majority of the electorate. And when we talk to voters, we find them talking not about cancel culture or the culture wars, we find them talking about Covid- 19, about the state of the economy and, to some degree, about this movement for racial justice where the majority of Americans in polls anyway tell us they feel sympathy, they are moved by these largely peaceful protests around issues like police violence. They do not see this as a battle against Marxism and anarchy. EMANUEL: Jason, what's your take on the present going to Mount Rushmore in the middle of this statue removal controversy? JASON CHAFFETZ, FORMER CONGRESSMAN (R-UT) AND FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, I know that the president went there in part because of an invitation from Governor Kristi Noem that started back in 2017. I think it was the right move. And I've got to tell you, I think Americans are tired. I think they're fed up with having the far left tell them that everything is wrong in America, that the statues you've been looking at, the history of the America -- of America is wrong and that the flag is something you shouldn't stand and salute and -- and I -- I just think America is tired of that. And I -- I think the president standing tall for America and saluting the flag, going to Mount Rushmore, is a good and positive thing and I think it will pay dividends and I don't think that Democrats and Joe Biden have an answer to that because it is just negative, negative, negative and it's not about the future. EMANUEL: Now there's also the effort to lay out camping strategy and define the opponent. Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale saying in a \"Washington Post\" op-ed, Biden wrote the 1994 crime bill. He championed China's entry to the World Trade Organization and he voted for the war in Iraq. He goes on to write, every single one of those major decisions that make up Biden's legacy contributed to the electorate's pushed back against the status quo. Charlie, is Biden's nearly five decades of public service a liability? HURT: I think it's -- I think it is a liability. And you have this strange dynamic where you have a sitting president who gets to run for re-election a second time as an outsider. You've got a guy like Joe Biden, who's been here for 47 -- been in Washington, been, quote/unquote, part of the problem for 47 years. It's a pretty hard thing. And -- and to listen to Joe Biden, well, you know, one of the sort of more amusing parts of this debate about -- that troubles -- I do think troubles a lot of Americans is to listen to Joe Biden talk about how he finally wants to see America address systemic racism. Well, he had eight years in - - in -- in the administration as vice president. You mean you did nothing during eight years to address systemic racism? We're only now finally addressing it? And then, of course, before he was in the White House, he was in Congress for 40 years. And-- and -- and this -- and so, you know, if -- if you do make the argument that there are all of these problems and that there are these systemic racism pervades every aspect of our -- our country, well, I mean, I don't know who you look to, to blame for that, but somebody who's been in Washington, part of the legislature for 40 years who was in the White House for -- for eight years. EMANUEL: Susan, how do you assess enthusiasm? Are Democrats fired up about Joe Biden or are they just motivated to get rid of President Trump? PAGE: Well, you know, we had a \"USA Today\"/Suffolk poll out this week that showed Biden with a 12-point lead. That's pretty -- a pretty muscular lead, but President Trump continued to have an edge on enthusiasm. President Trump's supporters were more -- much more enthusiastic about voting for him than Biden's supporters were about voting for Biden. But Biden's supporters were extremely enthusiastic about this. They were enthusiastic about voting against President Trump. So this is an election like some elections that we see with incumbents running for re-election where President Trump is defining both sides of this contest. He is the motivator both for those who are voting for him and for those who are voting for the other guy. EMANUEL: Jason, as a former chairman in the United States Congress, where does this Russia bounty story go and if top intelligence Democrats were briefed on it in February, how big of a failure is it across our government? CHAFFETZ: Well, I do think the administration needs to continue to provide information for Congress. Think Congress is right for asking for it. The question I have personally is, why do we still have troops in Afghanistan? I mean that -- that still bothers me, the longest war. The president promised we were going to bring those troops home. They can't kill them if they're not there. If we have actionable intelligence, go out and take them and kill the enemy. I don't have a problem with that at all. But I -- I -- I do think that there is more information that needs to be gleaned. I think that Nancy Pelosi and others trying to blame Donald Trump, that he's too close to Putin, that is so yesterday. We had a Mueller report. There is nothing to any of those stories and it's shameful that Nancy Pelosi would try to pain then on Donald Trump. I think that was totally wrong. EMANUEL: Susan, briefly, does this Afghanistan story have legs? PAGE: Yes, there is no issues that unites Americans of all stripes more than protecting our troops in battle. And I think a lot of Americans, on both sides, are looking for President Trump to address this, to criticize it and to say, if it's true, how is the United States going to respond and retaliate? That is something he has not yet done. EMANUEL: Charlie, final thought on this? Does this story go anywhere in the fall? HURT: I have a hard time seeing that it's going to make much of a difference in terms of the election. Largely because, you know, we've sort of been through this -- this fever dream that Republic -- that Democrats have pushed for four years now about Trump and Russia. And --and -- and it's -- and it underscores the perils of -- of trying to politicize absolutely everything. There are a lot of things that we don't know about this case, but -- but one thing is for certain, there are some very damaging leaks that are coming out of the -- the -- the government based on all this stuff and -- and, you know, that's -- those are -- those are serious problems. EMANUEL: Insight four months to Election Day promises to be a very spirited race to the finish line. Panel, thanks very much. See you next Sunday. CHAFFETZ: Thank you. EMANUEL: Up next, our \"Power Players of the Week.\" It's one of the Army's proudest and loudest units that fires those 21 gun salute for presidents. We will take you behind the scenes. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) EMANUEL: They are rarely seen, but you can certainly hear their work from miles away, members of the Artillery Unit that honors presidents and other dignitaries with remarkable precision. As Chris Wallace first told you last summer, they are our \"Power Players of the Week. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SFC. JOSHUA WOOD, U.S. ARMY: The Old Guard bases itself on perfection. SGT. DANIEL STEWART, U.S. ARMY: If we mess up, people know. So I like the fact that we tend to not do that. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Ready, (INAUDIBLE). WALLACE: Sergeant Daniel Stewart and Sergeant First Class Joshua Wood are members of the Presidential Salute Battery. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Standby. Fire. WALLACE: That fires cannons at all the big events in Washington, presidential inaugurations and funerals, special concerts, and visits by distinguished guests, and burials at Arlington National Cemetery. WOOD: When you are shooting for a president, like, that's -- that's the biggest -- that's like the Super Bowl. There is no room for error. The whole world is watching you. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Ready battery. WALLACE (voice over): We got a rare look behind the scenes -- UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Settle down. WALLACE: At the extraordinary precision in everything the PSB does. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Fire. WALLACE: There's a five-man staff and two men on each canon. The watchmen orders each fire. But in the echo of the booms, they found yelling one, two, three got lost. STEWART: Tap (ph). Three. (INAUDIBLE). Step (ph). Ready (ph). Cut (ph). WALLACE (on camera): And you do that every three seconds? STEWART: Every three seconds. Yes, sir. WALLACE (voice over): What if the watchman loses his voice? The PSB has a plan for that. STEWART: Top (ph). WOOD: (INAUDIBLE). WALLACE (on camera): He messes up, and now who does it? WOOD: The chief next to him. WALLACE: Because there's no room for error? WOOD: There's not. WALLACE (voice over): They guns are M-5 anti-tank canons from World War II, that saw action from North Africa to the Battle of the Bulge. Three teams are usually assigned to a ceremony. But if there's a misfire, there's a backup unit just in case. WOOD: My left hand is on my side. As soon as I lift it up, the back-up gunner, like you said, is looking at this hand. As soon as it moves, he pulls his lanyard (ph), which basically sets the gun off. WALLACE: And if there's another misfire, the backup crew has to be ready to go again. WOOD: As a loader, I'll load the rounds in three seconds, putting it inside the breach (ph). Close the breach (ph). And then re-fire. And the same process is done until the ceremony is complete. DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: So help me God. WALLACE: If you think that's overkill, it happened at the Trump inauguration. WOOD: There was actually two or three misfires during the inaugural honors that were being rendered. And I was loading fast enough that it didn't even skip a beat. It didn't sound like anything happen. WALLACE: The PSB is part of the Old Guard, the longest-serving active infantry unit in the Army, that's also charged with standing watch at the Tomb of the Unknowns, which brings us to watch they see as their main mission. WALLACE (on camera): With the military at war and some of your colleagues in actual combat, why is the Presidential Salute Battery important? STEWART: Every family that is in that cemetery, they only get one funeral, so it needs to be the best ceremony you can give. WOOD: You want to give them protection because their loved one served their country. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Stand by. STEWART: I -- I just -- I love it. The firing canons. I love the honoring the fallen. And just paying my respects. (END VIDEOTAPE) EMANUEL: Their precision and professionalism are pretty awesome. This year the team marked the holiday from a distance, firing cannons at noon yesterday, at Joint Base Meyer, Henderson Hall, across the river in Virginia. And however you are celebrating, we want to wish you a very safe and happy and healthy Independence Day weekend. And that's it for today. Chris is back next Sunday. Have a great week and we will see you next FOX NEWS SUNDAY.

Democrats have said that the $1 trillion GOP proposal, which is controversial within even the Republican caucus \u2026 does not do nearly enough. But McConnell accused Democrats of not stepping up to the table to negotiate over what he called a \u2018serious\u2019 proposal in contrast with House Democrats $3 trillion bill that was passed in May \u2026 \u2018The only reason I can see that Speaker Pelosi and the Democratic leader would sabotage negotiations is if, as some concluded when they killed police reform in June, they actually think bipartisan progress for the country would hurt their own political chances.\u2019\u201d\u00a0: \u201c\u00a0on Tuesday called the Senate Republicans' coronavirus relief package \u2018semi-irrelevant\u2019 when asked whether he supported the legislation at a news conference, underscoring the deep divides between the White House, congressional Republicans and congressional Democrats as lawmakers scramble to pass something in the coming days. \u2026 \u2018And we'll be talking about it. There are also things that I very much support. But we'll be negotiating. It's sort of semi-irrelevant because the Democrats come with their needs and asks and the Republicans go with theirs. So we'll be discussing that with [Senate Majority Leader] Mitch [McConnell] and all of the other people involved.\u2019 The Senate package certainly doesn't include all that Trump wants. Republicans refused to support a payroll tax cut, which Trump made clear was a priority. And Trump is right that the Senate GOP plan is almost certain to undergo a major overhaul before it reaches his desk.\u201d\u00a0: \u201cCongress constitutes its own temporal distortion. Its own wrinkles in the space-time continuum. Congress sometimes serves as a literal black hole, consuming time. It\u2019s either nothing o\u2019clock \u2013 or the 11th hour. That\u2019s because little of consequence gets done on Capitol Hill until the 11th hour. And after months of a time vacuum amid coronavirus, the clock is ticking again on Capitol Hill. It\u2019s the 11th hour, as lawmakers struggle to finalize the next round of pandemic legislation. \u2018This won\u2019t get done until the 11th hour,\u2019 said one senior administration source to Fox about the bill recently. Sure about that? \u2026 The true deadline is the end of the week. Extra unemployment benefits Congress approved for workers to cope with the pandemic expire on Friday night. And the rent comes due for millions then, too. You can practically hear the chimes tolling.\u201d\u00a0: \u201cRep.\u00a0\u00a0\u2014 a Texas Republican who has been walking around the Capitol without a mask \u2014 has tested positive for the coronavirus, according to multiple sources. Gohmert was scheduled to fly to Texas on Wednesday morning with President Donald Trump and tested positive in a pre-screen at the White House. The eighth-term Republican told CNN last month that he was not wearing a mask because he was being tested regularly for the coronavirus. \u2018[I]f I get it,\u2019 he told CNN in June, \u2018you'll never see me without a mask.\u2019 Reps.\u00a0\u00a0(R-Fla.),\u00a0\u00a0(R-Fla.),\u00a0\u00a0(R-Va.),\u00a0(R-Pa.),\u00a0\u00a0(D-Utah) and\u00a0\u00a0(R-S.C.) have tested positive for the virus, along with Sen.\u00a0\u00a0(R-Ky.).\u201d\n\u201cWhen\u00a0\u00a0recommends a small extent for republics, the standards he had in view were of dimensions far short of the limits of almost every one of these States. Neither Virginia, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, New York, North Carolina, nor Georgia can by any means be compared with the models from which he reasoned and to which the terms of his description apply.\u201d \u2013\u00a0: \u201cThe same mathematical model that explains how crystals grow can also explain how tropical stingless bees build honeycombs in spiraling, multi-terraced shapes, according to a study published on Wednesday in the\u00a0. Bees from the genus\u00a0\u00a0specialize in sophisticated feats of architecture built from hexagonal beeswax cells. Each individual cell is both the landing spot for an egg and a building block for structures that can grow up to 20 levels high,\u00a0\u00a0reports for\u00a0. Stingless bees\u2019 hives can come in several shapes, including stacks of circles in a bulls-eye, a spiral, a double spiral, and a group of disorderly terraces. How and why bees build the complex shapes without any blueprints has perplexed scientists, but the researchers show that each individual bee might be following a few simple rules. \u2026 When each bee follows the same rules in a different part of the hive, a pattern emerges overall.\u201d\u00a0Email us at\u00a0\u00a0with your tips, comments or questions.\u00a0\u00a0NATIONAL HEAD-TO-HEAD AVERAGE\u00a0\u00a040.6 percent\u00a0\u00a051.8 percent\u00a0\u00a0Biden by 11.2 points\u00a0Biden no change in points, Trump no change in points\u00a0[]\u00a0BATTLEGROUND POWER RANKINGS\u00a0(270 electoral votes needed to win)\u00a0(109 electoral votes): Wisconsin (10), Ohio (18), Florida (29), Arizona (11), Pennsylvania (20), North Carolina (15), Iowa (6)\u00a0(180 electoral votes)\u00a0(249 electoral votes)\u00a0TRUMP JOB PERFORMANCE\u00a040.8 percent\u00a0\u00a056.4 percent\u00a0\u00a0-15.6 points\u00a0no change in points\u00a0[.]\u00a0\u00a0We\u2019ve brought \u201cFrom the Bleachers\u201d to video on demand thanks to Fox Nation.

Plus, Chris answers what Dana calls \u201cthe best trivia we've ever had.\u201d\u00a0: \u201c\u2019s campaign has quietly receded from the television airwaves in Michigan in recent weeks, shifting money elsewhere as one of the key Midwestern states that powered his surprise victory in 2016 threatens to move more firmly back into the Democratic column in 2020. Michigan began the year with expectations that it would be one of the most intense battlegrounds in the country, but its share of Trump television advertising dollars dwindled this summer as\u00a0built a steady advantage in the polls. Since the end of June, Mr. Trump has spent more money on ads in 10 other states \u2014 with Michigan falling behind even much smaller states like Iowa and Nevada \u2014 and in recent days, Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign stopped buying ads in Michigan entirely. The Biden campaign has more than tripled what Mr. Trump spent on television in Michigan in the last month, by far the most lopsided advantage of any swing state where both are advertising.\u201d\u00a0: \u201cPresident Donald Trump is headed to Odessa and Midland today for his 16th visit to Texas during his presidency. Trump is set to land in Midland at 11:30 a.m. before going to Odessa for a fundraising event at the Marriott. The president will later tour an oil rig at Double Eagle Energy in Midland and talk about his energy policies. The president's visit just a couple months before early voting begins highlights how Texas might see a closer presidential race than it has in decades. Three public polls show Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden in a dead heat, the Houston Chronicle reports. Before this, Texas was a reliable source of votes for Republicans.\u2026 Biden criticized Trump's visit as the state reels from the coronavirus and Hurricane Hanna, the Houston Chronicle reports. \u2018Mr. Trump, now isn\u2019t the time for politicking or photo-ops,\u2019 Biden said Wednesday morning.\u201d:\u00a0\u201cDonald Trump and Joe Biden are engaged in a tight race for Georgia\u2019s electoral votes according to the Monmouth University Poll. \u2026 Among all registered voters in Georgia, Trump is supported by 47% and Biden is supported by 47%, with 3% saying they will vote for Libertarian\u00a0\u00a0and 3% who are undecided. These results include 42% who are certain to vote for Trump and 39% who say the same for Biden. At the other end of the spectrum, 45% say they are not at all likely to vote for the incumbent and 44% say the same for challenger. \u2026\u00a0Overall, 46% of Georgia voters have a favorable opinion of Trump and 45% have an unfavorable one \u2013 including 38% very unfavorable. Biden gets a 41% favorable and 46% unfavorable rating, including 34% very unfavorable.\u201d: \u201cFormer Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee, was captured Tuesday holding a note with Sen.\u00a0' name printed across the top with talking points, including, \u2018Do not hold grudges.\u2019 The other talking points about Harris were: \u2018Campaigned with me & Jill.\u2019 \u2018Talented.\u2019 \u2018Great help to campaign.\u2019 \u2018Great respect for her.\u2019 Harris, D-Calif., was a Biden rival when she was running her own campaign for president but has since emerged as a top contender for the vice presidency. The does \u2018not hold grudges\u2019 talking point may be reference to the clash between the two at the first Democratic debate, when the former California attorney general went after Biden, who was considered the front-runner for most of 2019, on his civil rights record. \u2026 According to POLITICO, former Sen.\u00a0, who is a member of Biden\u2019s vice presidential search committee, was stunned by Harris' attack, reportedly saying, \u2018She laughed and said, \u2018that\u2019s politics.\u2019 She had no remorse.\u2019 Those comments have drawn criticism, especially from Democratic women, who say Harris is being held to a standard that wouldn\u2019t apply to a man.\u201d\u00a0: \u201cJoe Biden said Tuesday he would have his choice for a vice presidential running mate the first week of August. \u2018I\u2019m going to have a choice the first week in August and I promise I\u2019ll let you know when I do,\u2019 the Democratic presidential nominee told reporters after delivering a speech about the racial-equity part of his economic plan. Biden had previously pushed back his deadline for a decision from Aug. 1 to a bit later in the month. The Democratic National Convention starts on Aug. 17 and he is almost certain to announce his choice before that. The former vice president has pledged to choose a woman running mate. Last week he said that the group of candidates he was still considering included four Black women, among others.\u201d\u00a0: \u201c[A Monmouth University poll] showed close races in Georgia\u2019s two U.S. Senate contests. Republican U.S. Sen.\u00a0\u00a0held a 49-43 lead over Democrat\u00a0. \u2026 In Georgia\u2019s other U.S. Senate race, the free-for-all special election for U.S. Sen.\u00a0\u2019s seat, showed the Republican incumbent with a narrow advantage. Loeffler led the pack with 26% of support, followed by fellow Republican U.S. Rep.\u00a0\u00a0at 20%.\u00a0\u00a0was the top Democrat with 14% of the vote, trailed by\u00a0\u00a0at 9% and\u00a0\u00a0at 5%. \u2026 Another 18% of voters are undecided. That contest will feature 21 candidates all on the same ballot with no primary to filter out nominees. If no candidate gets a majority of the vote \u2013 a highly likely scenario \u2013 the two top finishers head to a January runoff.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0: \u201cA slew of dismal summer polls and a persistent fundraising gap have left some Republicans fretting about a nightmare scenario in November: That they will fall further into the House minority. Publicly, House GOP leaders are declaring they can still net the 17 seats needed to flip the chamber. But privately, some party strategists concede it\u2019s a much grimmer picture, with as many as 20 Republican seats at risk of falling into Democratic hands. Far from going on offense, the GOP could be forced to retrench in order to limit its losses. There's a growing fear that President Donald Trump\u2019s plummeting popularity in the suburbs could threaten GOP candidates in traditionally favorable districts, and that their party's eagerness to go on offense might leave some underfunded incumbents and open GOP-held seats unprotected. Internal Democratic surveys in recent weeks have shown tight races in once-solid GOP seats in Indiana, Texas, Michigan, Ohio and Montana that Trump carried handily 2016 \u2014 data that suggest the battleground is veering in a dangerous direction for the GOP.\u201d: \u201cTwo years ago, the notion of running a progressive\u00a0\u00a0supporter in a Trump district in Texas would have been seen as political suicide. Now,\u00a0, a school-board member who talks about her path from homelessness to the pinnacle of local politics, is considered one of the Democrats\u2019 top House recruits in the country. In the primary, she defeated a retired Air Force colonel, the type of candidate who would typically be seen as better-positioned to win over moderate swing voters. Meanwhile, the biggest-name Democratic congressional hopeful in Texas is former gubernatorial candidate\u00a0. Davis, whose abortion-rights activism backfired in the conservative-minded red state during her 2014 race, is suddenly looking like a viable candidate in the reliably Republican 21st District, which is even more Trump-friendly than the state at large.\u201d\u00a0:\u201cSo much for Southern hospitality. This fall, Tennessee will say goodbye to retiring Sen.\u00a0, one of the last of the genteel Republican moderates in the chamber. And the race to replace him has turned into perhaps the ugliest Republican primary in the country \u2014 with spurious super PAC attacks,\u00a0\u00a0being invoked as a slur and President Donald Trump lining up on opposite sides as Sen.\u00a0. The race was never supposed to be competitive: The Trump-backed candidate,\u00a0\u00a0\u2014 who served as the president\u2019s ambassador to Japan \u2014 was on a glide path. Trump endorsed Hagerty before he even left Tokyo or entered the race. But as the contest has tightened in the run-up to the Aug. 6 election, Hagerty's main opponent,\u00a0, has found traction by claiming to be the true, unapologetic Trumpian conservative in the race \u2014 while blasting Hagerty as a squishy, Mitt Romney-loving phony.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0: \u201cDemocrats on Tuesday notched two victories in lawsuits aimed at making it easier to vote by mail during the pandemic. The state of Rhode Island agreed to eliminate witness or notary requirements for people voting by mail throughout the 2020 elections due to the Covid-19 pandemic. A judge signed off on the agreement Tuesday. The case was brought on behalf of two voting rights advocacy groups -- the League of Women Voters of Rhode Island and Common Cause Rhode Island\u2026 Also on Tuesday, a judge in Minnesota blocked election officials from enforcing a state law that prohibited voters from helping more than three other people to cast absentee ballots, handing a significant win to two national Democratic organizations that sued to end the provisions.\u201d: \u201cThe Lincoln Project, a group founded by \"never Trump\" Republicans that has produced some of the cycle's most memorable ads, today begins spending $4 million to blitz Senate races in Alaska, Maine and Montana. This is the Lincoln Project's biggest buy to date, and the Senate ads will air for seven to 10 days in key markets. The ads \u2014 which include \u2018Real\u2019 in Alaska and \u2018Strong\u2019 in Montana \u2014 support challengers to incumbent Republicans. \u2018Trump Stooge,\u2019 airing in Maine, criticizes Sen. Susan Collins for not standing up to President Trump. \u2018Maine deserves a leader, not a Trump stooge,\u2019 the ad says. \u2018We\u2019re moving into the active phase of the fall campaign as voters, stuck at home because of COVID-19, tune in earlier than ever,\u2019 communications director\u00a0\u00a0told Axios.\u201d: \u201c[The] tactical case for conducting a Sherman\u2019s march through the GOP is weak. The problem is not just that very few voters cast their ballots for tactical reasons. It\u2019s that it\u2019s not at all clear that the Republican Party can be burned down or Trumpism extinguished. Let\u2019s say that the November elections lead to Republicans losing the White House, 20 House seats, 12 Senate seats and five governorships: a result considerably worse for the Republicans than most observers expect. That would leave them with roughly the same amount of power they had in 2009, after\u00a0\u2019s disastrous second term. Eight years later, they had a majority of everything. Or think back to the aftermath of Watergate. Four years after\u00a0left office, they had the White House again and their first Senate majority in decades. Parties can bounce back quickly, even after defeats that look epochal.\u201d\u00a0: \u201cFederal officers will start pulling out of Portland on Thursday in a phased withdrawal and state troopers will arrive instead to help safeguard the federal courthouse downtown that has become a national symbol of political conflict as well as a focal point for protests calling for consequential police reform. Gov.\u00a0\u00a0made the announcement in a statement Wednesday and described the federal officers \u2018an occupying force\u2019 that has \u2018refused accountability and brought strife to our community.\u2019 Acting Homeland Security Secretary\u00a0, in a separate announcement, said he had been in talks with the governor in the last day and agreed to a \u2018joint plan to end the violent activity in Portland directed at federal properties and law enforcement.\u2019 But he tempered the statement by saying the \u2018augmented\u2019 federal force would remain in Portland \u2018until the violent activity toward our facility ends. We are not removing any law enforcement while our facilities and law enforcement remain under attack.\u2019\u201d: \u201cTuesday marked the 62nd consecutive night demonstrations continued in downtown Portland in the wake of George Floyd\u2019s death in police custody in Minneapolis. Portland police officers clashed with demonstrators before federal agents arrived to protect the\u00a0\u00a0U.S. Courthouse, Multnomah County Justice Center, and other government buildings the July 4 weekend. Crowds -- ranging from hundreds to thousands of people -- have tried almost every night to tear down a fence erected to protect the courthouse. They\u2019ve set fires and hurled fireworks, Molotov cocktails, and bricks, rocks, and bottles at the agents inside. Authorities this week reinforced the fence by putting concrete highway barriers around it. Federal officers often respond by firing tear gas, pepper balls, and impact munitions.\u201d\u00a0: \u201cThe Pentagon is proceeding with President Donald Trump's plan to move 12,000 U.S. troops out of Germany \u2013 about 6,400 forces will be brought home and 5,400 shifted to other countries in Europe, U.S. defense officials said Wednesday. The move will cost billions of dollars and take years to complete. It has attracted bipartisan congressional opposition, raised concerns among NATO allies and appears to be fueled at least in part by Trump\u2019s displeasure at Germany's failure to spend more on defense. The Pentagon said the action was part of its plan to strategically \u2018reposition\u2019 U.S. forces in Europe to better counter threats from Russia and China. \u2026 \u2018They take advantage of us on trade, and they take advantage of us on the military,\u2019 Trump said of Germany on Wednesday, speaking to White House reporters. \u2018So we're reducing the force because they\u2019re not paying their bills. It's very simple. They\u2019re delinquent,\u2019 Trump added, before heading to Texas for a campaign event.\u201d\u00a0: \u201cPresident Trump has never confronted\u00a0\u00a0with intelligence indicating Russia paid the Taliban to kill U.S. troops, he told \u2018Axios on HBO\u2019 in an interview on Tuesday. Why it matters: Democrats have seized on the issue, and Trump's reluctance to discuss it, as evidence he\u2019s unwilling to challenge Putin even when American lives are at stake. Trump spoke with Putin on Thursday, and subsequently deflected a question about whether he\u2019d raised the alleged bounty scheme, saying on Monday: \u2018We don't talk about what we discussed, but we had plenty of discussion.\u2019 In Tuesday\u2019s interview, he was definitive: \u2018I have never discussed it with him.\u2019 Pressed on why he didn\u2019t raise the matter in Thursday\u2019s call, he said: \u2018That was a phone call to discuss other things, and frankly that\u2019s an issue that many people said was fake news.\u2019\u201d\u00a0\u00a0-\u00a0\u00a0-\u00a0\u00a0-\u00a0\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s like a giraffe and a flamingo. They\u2019re both at a zoo. A dumb person may think they could mate for offspring. A smart person knows that\u2019s impossible. That\u2019s our bills. They\u2019re unable to mate.\u201d \u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI am currently a graduate student studying math and engineering so, I admit, my grasp on the finer details of history is not as good as I would like it to be. I often hear it stated that Jefferson and Hamilton created the ideological divide in American politics with their differing philosophies. The implication being, that Jefferson is the father of the democrats and Hamilton the father of republicanism. \u2026 Any thoughts on the shifting sentiments in the established parties or could you recommend and books that can explain this in more detail? Final question, do find it conceivable that the Republican Party can ever adopt a form of Thatcher-ism or is it more likely that we will be plagued by populism for the foreseeable future?\u201d \u2013\u00a0\u00a0[]\u00a0\u201cWhat\u2019s your take on what would happen if Trump is defeated and a new Democrat majority is elected to the Senate, but between election day and January 20th there is a vacancy among the liberal side of the Supreme Court.

That is in just a moment.We will discuss the brand-new RNC news in terms of the convention in Florida has been canceled and the president's reasons why. What is the backup plan? We'll ask him that.We'll also talk about the violence, the -- literally, what he calls the war zone in America's cities. We'll talk about the upcoming election, COVID-19, left-wing conspiracy theories, Joe Biden, a lot to get to tonight.First, we do have major breaking news surrounding what we have identified on this show correctly as the biggest abuse of power, corruption scandal in American history, and that is Obama, Biden, Comey working together to destroy President Trump, first candidate Trump and transition team Trump.Now we have more definitive proof tonight because a bombshell document has now tonight been declassified by the DNI Director Radcliffe. It shows the most extreme measures that Jim Comey, Mr. Higher Honor himself, his FBI took in 2016 to spy on then-candidate Donald Trump.These newly unearthed materials include typewritten notes from an FBI agent named Joe Pientka detailing August 2016 briefing with Donald Trump, Lieutenant General Flynn and former Governor Chris Christie of New Jersey.The meeting was supposed to be just a routine defensive briefing that presidential candidates received from the FBI, but in truth, in reality, it was all a ruse. According to a source, the briefing was, quote, a cover to listen for any remarks from President Trump or anyone else about Russia.So, let's be clear, we now have indisputable evidence that the FBI literally early on planted a Crossfire Hurricane agent to spy on Team Trump. It also means that Jim Comey, Mr. Higher Honor, is caught in another massive lie.Jim, I reminded you a long time ago -- well, you have the rewrite to remain silent, I advised you to use. You should have listened. By the way, he testified that Trump was not under investigation, proving another lie. Take a look.All right, apparently, we didn't have that. We'll have it hopefully soon.Like he lied when he said the dirty dossier. Remember he went to Trump Tower, took notes as soon as he left, and he said that the dossier presented it alone to then -- well, President-elect Trump, said it's salacious but unverified.But we know that he used that dossier as the bulk of information to secure the FISA warrant to spy on candidate Trump just a month earlier.The official notes from the security briefing were filed under Crossfire Hurricane, which of course, was the official code name for Comey's Russia collusion witch hunt. It was a witch hunt.By the way, that bought and paid for dirty Russian dossier of Russian disinformation, Hillary paid for that. Guess who helped Hillary? It looks like Vladimir Putin's Russia.It was also filed under Crossfire Razor. Remember, that was the code name for the FBI's probe into and we now know the innocent Lieutenant General Michael Flynn. It is now time for investigative prosecutor Durham to now wrap this up, bring this to a grand jury, and we need indictments of every single solitary person involved in this corruption, this abuse of power, their premeditated lies to the FISA court, their denial of one American of civil liberties and constitutional rights, and them trying to influence the outcome of an election, and then undo a duly elected president.Mr. Durham, no more time for investigating. It's time for action. The evidence is overwhelming. It is incontrovertible. That and the public domain that we know could -- should result in indictments up all of these people we talk about.Now, get this. The agent that did conduct this, quote, briefing, Joe Pientka, was apparently running the Flynn probe. And his, quote, briefing notes were approved by none other than the infamous Peter Strzok and the FBI lawyer -- we talked a lot about him too -- Kevin Clinesmith.Remember, Clinesmith, he was the corrupt FBI bureaucrat, he literally texted colleagues that Trump supporters were crazies, and that Vice President Pence was stupid, and after Trump won, he texted, viva la resistance.And according to Inspector General Horowitz, it was Clinesmith literally forging FISA evidence against Carter Page all to spy on, backdoor spy on candidate Trump, transition team Trump and deep into the presidency of Donald Trump. And, of course, Clinesmith, Strzok, and Pientka, well, they were just a tip of the spear in this Russia collusion hoax.Now, this was an effort that started at the very top. This was the insurance policy in the unlikely event that he wins. That was Page and Peter Strzok texting each other. Now, that's what Obama's infamous, remember this date, January 5th, 2017, that was the Oval Office meeting.You know, that was the meeting that Obama directed, we need the right people on this doing the work. And maybe we shouldn't tell all of this to the incoming administration.This is the January 5th meeting in the Oval Office where Joe Biden who lied to George Stephanopoulos, I didn't know anything about this, where we know from Peter Strzok's handwritten notes that Biden suggested that the FBI used the 1799 Logan Act, which has never been used ever to prosecute anyone.Now, remember this was the meeting that Sally Yates was at, and she was shocked according to her testimony before the House Intelligence Committee that President Obama knew all of the intimate details about the unmasking and leaking of raw intelligence as it relates to General Flynn, and, of course, soon to be Russian counterpart Kislyak.That's why Susan Rice went back on the day that Donald Trump was inaugurated 15 days after this Oval Office meeting to write what is now known as the biggest CYA email to self on Obama's last day, Trump being sworn in day, claiming that Barack said, do everything by the book. Why would she write that four times, 15 days later?Now, this was clearly an effort to, first, monitor and take down the new president, to undo an election, and take down everyone around him. But as we all know, although the mob and the media, they've gotten all of this wrong. They pushed lies, smears, besmirchment, conspiracy theories, the entire hoax, they were dragging and pushing impeachment, ignoring quid pro quo Joe and zero experience Hunter.There was no Russia collusion. It was always a hoax. The dossier that was used for all of these FISA applications has been debunked. It was never verifiable. We know the sub source said it was just bar talk and we know that Steele had an agenda and that everybody was warned way ahead of time that Hillary paid for the Russian disinformation.Now, the real scandal, the real abuse of power is that President Obama, what did you know, Barack, when did you know it? Joe, the ever confused one, what did you know, Joe, and when did you know it?We know they turn tremendous tools of your government against their political adversary. It's a national disgrace, all must be held accountable, prosecutor Durham, we are waiting. What we know already should be indictments for many. It's time!If we don't get this right, we will not have a constitutional republic. We won't have equal justice and equal application of our laws.Here with mark, Ohio Congressman Jim Jordan, FOX News contributor Sara Carter, FOX News legal analyst Gregg Jarrett.Congressman Jordan, we start with you.There is enough that we know, all of us --REP. JIM JORDAN, R-OHIO: Yes.HANNITY: -- there was not many of us, between Congress and our ensemble cast, that we're digging deep into this. I count maybe 25 people total taking on the entire media mob. They were all wrong.My question to you is, what does this say to you and what does it say to Durham?The FBI went to then-candidate Trump, told him Russia might try to target you and your campaign. What they didn't tell him is, we're targeting you. They told him Russian might try to spy on you. What they didn't tell him is, we're spying on you, and they did it just 17 days into this investigation.It opens on July 31st. August 17th, they do this. Thirteen minutes for the defensive briefing as part of the briefing you're supposed to get and in an hour and 42 minutes, where they are trying to get information and set the president up.All of this comes after, as you said, Sean, the August 8th text message where Peter Strzok says, we'll stop Trump. And the August 15th text message where he says, we've got an insurance policy. And they start implementing that insurance policy two days later.HANNITY: Sara Carter, you were there with John Solomon. It was March 2017 when the whole unmasking thing began. I had a conversation with both you, soon thereafter, Gregg Jarrett joined in. Got to keep unpeeling the layers of onion. I think it's now an infamous discussion we've had.SARA CARTER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Absolutely, Sean. And look at these documents, they are explosive because if you think about it, there was August 2016, here is Joe Pientka, right, debriefing basically Trump and Governor Christie and Michael Flynn.And then in January, he goes back to the White House with Peter Strzok. He goes back to the White House -- remember, he is the one that's interviewing Michael Flynn and collecting the information, all the while, just as Congressman Jordan says, they're spying on the president of the United States.You know, this is something that is so explosive and so big. And if John Durham doesn't do his job, it doesn't mean that just these three were involved, Sean. What you have to think about is the scope of this. Both Pientka, Peter Strzok, as well as Kevin Clinesmith and all the others were directed by people above them. That is Andrew McCabe, that's James Comey, and that's those folks that were at the White House, including the president, then -- Barack Obama who knew everything that was going on in January 5th.HANNITY: And they need to be asked. Barack needs to answer --CARTER: Yes.HANNITY: -- what did he know and when did he know it? Same with Joe.My question to you, Gregg Jarrett. You wrote two number one best-selling books on this, amazing work that you did.On the legal side of this, what we now have in the public domain is enough to get indictments for all of these people as far as I'm concerned.GREGG JARRETT, FOX NEWS LEGAL ANALYST: Yes.HANNITY: You tell me as a lawyer if I'm wrong and why is it taking so long?At this point, I think the Prosecutor Durham has an obligation to get this over with and let the American people know, we need to know before November 3rd of this year.JARRETT: Well, I think Durham has been slow footed, I agree. COVID may have been slow down a bit.But if there was ever any doubt about how devious and corrupt James Comey and his cabal were, they should remove doubt. This meeting was not about debriefing Trump. It was about gathering incriminating evidence of a non- existing collusion conspiracy that the FBI well knew was a hoax. They knew it was a lie, paid for by the Hillary Clinton campaign. They didn't care.At the heart of it, you're right, Joe Pientka, I write about him in my book. But interestingly, the government has scrubbed him from all reports, including the FBI report, and the Department of Justice report, even the FISA court report, and the FBI has removed him from their website and sequestered him in San Francisco's field office refusing to make him available, notwithstanding repeated demands to Congress. That's the cover- up by the existing FBI Director Christopher Wray.And the other part of this equation is that the documents today, they're exculpatory. They tend to prove Trump innocence. And yet, the FBI and Christopher Wray have concealed these documents, along with the intel community, for the better part of four years.It's unconscionable. It's corrupt. And it's a cover-up (ph).(CROSSTALK)HANNITY: We had a little problem earlier. Let me hear it, because this is Comey now denying that which we now know is true. This guy said -- the holier-than-thou Mr. Higher honor is so full of beep, beep, beep, I can't even say it. I wish I could. I can say it, but I'm going to have to deal with, you know, the fallout after.Here's what he said.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. RICHARD BURR, R-NC: Was the FBI able to confirm any criminal allegations contained in the Steele document?JAMES COMEY, FORMER FBI DIRECTOR: Mr. Chairman, I don't think that's a question I can answer in an open setting, because it goes into the details of the investigation.SEN. SUSAN COLLINS, R-MAINE: I want first to ask you about your conversations with the president, the three conversations in which you told him that he was not under investigation. The first was during your January 6th meeting, according to your testimony, in which it appears that you actually volunteered that insurance. Is that correct?COMEY: That's correct.COLLINS: Did you limit that statement to counterintelligence investigations, or were you talking about any kind of FBI investigation?COMEY: I didn't -- I didn't use the term counterintelligence. I was speaking to him and briefing him about some salacious and unverified material.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: That proves, Jim Jordan, he lied.JORDAN: Yes.HANNITY: And when he signed the first FISA warrant in October of 2016, and then went to Trump Tower and I believe it was December of 2017 and said it's salacious and unverified, well, in the FISA application, bulk of information of the dirty dossier, he said it was verified. He's a liar.JORDAN: Yes, he told Gowdy during the deposition that President Trump wasn't under investigation when we know based on his document that but just 17 days into the investigation, they were investigating the president for no reason, no predicate whatsoever.He also told us during that deposition that after ten months, when he gets fired May 9th, 2017, they didn't have a thing. We knew they didn't have anything. He knew they didn't have anything.Clapper, Brennan, Comey, they've all said the same thing, there wasn't anything there, and yet they put the country through this.I also think it's important, Sean, look at the names on the front page Sara was talking about. Clinesmith, the guy who lied to the FISA court. Pientka, who handles the Flynn investigation who did this -- this interview as well, or this briefing, whatever you call it. And then, of course, Peter Strzok who ran the whole darn thing.Those are the three names on the front page, as well as Crossfire Hurricane, and imagine this come, Crossfire Razor. They were after Mike Flynn from the get-go as well. That's what the front page of this document that was declassified today. That's what it shows us.HANNITY: All right, thank you all. We're going to be watching.Mr. Durham, we're ready. It's time. You've got enough time now.Thank you all.Now, President Trump is coming up in mere moments, literally within the next 10 minutes I'm told. It was just announced -- he just announced today a bold, new expansion what is known as Operation LeGend. Why? To help combat the war zones, the crime, the anarchy that is literally wreaking havoc and killing innocent Americans and people are not safe and secure in their own towns, their own cities.But over there at fake news MSNBC, the conspiracy channel, Joy Reid, congratulations on your new time slot, saying rising crime numbers are fairy tale is not exactly accurate. Well, then, she invited Congresswoman Maxine Waters in to discuss insane conspiracy theories that Trump is invading cities with a parliamentary and secret police as the trial run for the coming election coup.Watch for yourself.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. MAXINE WATERS, D-CALIF.: As a matter of fact, it has been suggested that this is a trial run of the president of the United States, who may be organizing to not accept what happened when we have the election if he's not elected.JOY REID, MSNBC HOST: And he helpfully said the quiet part out loud by pointing out that the cities that will be in a sense invaded by Trump's secret police led by Democratic mayors.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: It's not just Maxine in Joy Reid show spouting these insane ideas. By the way, this is their next hoax. If they hear the words and have to choke on the words over there, we can now come project Donald J. Trump has been reelected the 45th president of the United States. You, the American people, you will decide that in 103 days. I hope you choose wisely.There is a lot at stake. Take a look.(BERGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: People are looking at potentially a trial run for a kind of genuine attempt to true intimidation and potentially through force to try to, to try to steal this election.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The problem here is, apparently, the president has this imaginary world in his head where he thinks the U.S. cities are under siege.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The idea that federal agents are in a city with Americans, that is not really the point here. This is like secret police snatching up Americans, taking them into cars.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: You know, I take a look at this psychotic story from the insane Washington compost. It says Trump's assault on election integrity forces question. What will happen if we refuse to accept the election loss?What will Joe do? How about that?The left is now willing to do, say anything to beat President Trump. They are in a full panic, I can tell you that tonight. And, buckle up, it is going to be an insane 103 days.Remember, Nancy Pelosi referring to federal agents in Portland, calling them stormtroopers. Jim Clyburn also in leadership in the Democratic House, comparing federal agents to Nazi Gestapo.Of the Democratic representatives claiming Trump is trying to start a race war. No, he's trying to save lives.In Seattle, that ever incompetent far left Mayor Jenny Durkan, remember the summer of love zone? Remember, it's an autonomous zone, the CHAZ, CHOP zone, the spaghetti pot luck dinner zone, telling fake news CNN that she was very unsettled. People died because of the stupidity of her not maintaining law and order.Take a look.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MAYOR JENNY DURKAN, D-SEATTLE: I have to tell you, it's so unsettling the president continues down this path. And I think it's unfortunate again the president is using federal law enforcement as a political tool. That is so dangerous for America.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: What's dangerous is, is that you allowed a mob, an anarchist to take over city blocks, including a police precinct four weeks. You called at the summer of love, spaghetti pot luck dinner zone.Well, I had to call come -- apparently, you didn't -- you take the time to call Horace Lorenzo Anderson Sr., who lost his 19-year-old son, killed in your summer of love zone. You wouldn't allow the police to restore order until -- well, let's see, that's right, what to young African-Americans were murdered in that zone. Many others injured.And according to a report, President Trump plans to send a tactical seem to Seattle as standby if the violent riots continue because she's allowing it.We got the same problem in Portland. We've got the dopey mayor there, the guy's name is Ted Wheeler. Loud riots now to fester there for 55 straight days. Apparently, Wheeler thinks this is mostly peaceful protesting.I saw a lot of rocks, bottles, graffiti, literally businesses shut down, total mess. Take a look.(VIDEO CLIP PLAYS)HANNITY: Ted Wheeler, does your city look safe and secure to you? Or I might just not believing what I'm saying?In fact, apparently, this dope once federal agents in Portland actually to go home, stop protecting the federal buildings that under law they're supposed to protect that were lit on fire last night. Ted Wheeler is totally detached like so many other liberals. You have all these liberal mayors. They have one thing in command. They have led their cities, no safety, no security and rotten educational systems for decades.He seems to think that there's absolutely nothing wrong with the anarchy playing out in his city. Last night, he was actually there in support of the anarchists, where ironically he ended up being harassed and stalked and assaulted.Democrats are now living in an upside down world. They vilify the police while the appeasing of violent rioters. They let violent criminals out of jail. There's no bail in New York, with those stupid policies. They trashed the president for trying to protect innocent life and send in help to stop the violence and restore law and order. And time and time again, they put politics and hatred of Donald Trump over the lives and safety of their own citizens.By the way, come November, well, you will let them take the reins of the entire country because only you have the power to stop it at the ballot box because Joe Biden is a guy that said, yes, the police have now become the enemy, and, of course, I support reallocating funds. Now, he's denying it, but he said it. We have the tape.Here with reaction, Fox\u00a0News contributor Dan Bongino, Fox\u00a0News correspondent at large, Geraldo Rivera, civil rights attorney, Leo Terrell.Geraldo, we begin with you.You know what, Geraldo, what I love about you, is you love your fellow human beings. You have been a street reporter as we say, all these years, trying to help people with better, safer lives.These cities aren't safe. Against all logic and reason, they won't allow any help to prevent violence and death. Why?GERALDO RIVERA, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT-AT-LARGE: Why? Because they are politicians and bad politicians. Ted Wheeler, the mayor there in Portland, booed off of the stage, ridiculed, they were yelling for his resignation by the time his attempt at street theater was over.Meantime, in Chicago, another 3-year-old child, another 3-year-old girl was shot yesterday. Ten people a shot total, three of them died. Three more murders in Chicago yesterday. And that is with all the heat on the gangsters.HANNITY: Yes.RIVERA: And the police superintendent there, David Brown, proud black man, got up there and announced to the world that there are ten times as many gangbangers as they were Chicago cops.HANNITY: Unbelievable.RIVERA: There are 12,000 Chicago cops, 117,000 gangsters. I mean, at what point do the people, the average citizens in that city just revolt? At what point do they say, screw you, mayor, we need all the help we can get? And even then it might not be enough.(CROSSTALK)HANNITY: Joe Biden is misleading them, Geraldo.All right. I'd just gotten the two-minute warning in my ear. That means the president will be taking over for you three, not that you are not great guests and good friends.Dan Bongino, you get the last 2 minutes.DAN BONGINO, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, just a quick piece of misinformation we have to correct here. These are not federal troops. They are federal agents. They are not unmarked. They do have markings.There are also federal agents -- to correct again, more liberal misinformation I've heard on cable news. There are federal agents, listening up, folks, in every major city in America right now. They don't need permission from anyone to enforce federal law. Whoever told you that is absolutely lying.So there you go. More liberal misinformation.HANNITY: Don't we want safety and security? Leo Terrell, one day, I'm going to pull out the old tapes, just for old times' sake of you being on the show and you and I disagreeing on pretty much everything.LEO TERRELL, CIVIL RIGHTS ATTORNEY: No.HANNITY: I'm going to pull out the tape of you ripping out your earpiece, throw it on your microphone.TERRELL: No, no, no, listen, let me get my minute. Let me get my minute end. Let me get my minute in.President Trump, this is Leo Trump 2.0. I'm telling you keep providing safety of these cities.CNN, MSNBC, you are lying to your Democrats. Look at the film footage that Sean just showed about these cities. You're lying. And if you -- stop having these commentators lie about the lack of violence. There's total violence.President Trump, continue to do your job. Law and order in these Democratic cities. It's ridiculous. Totally ridiculous.HANNITY: But apparently, we have an extra minute and a half.All right. Geraldo --TERRELL: Good.HANNITY: I -- well, I hate -- you know, you are all favorite people. So, I mean, you're my -- we're all best friends.But I really -- I want the president to act. He can't act, Geraldo, unless there's 15 mayors in all these liberal cities are saying, we don't want your help! What is -- what is wrong with these people?RIVERA: Chicago though, Sean -- if Chicago is the model, and the mayor is squawking about federal troops and the front door and accepting federal help in the back door. I'm OK with that. I'm OK with politics as long as they get the job done.How do you get the job done? You have to go after these organized criminal gangs and put them out of business, Sean.HANNITY: All right. The president is on the line, just for kicks and giggles.I want Leo Terrell, lifelong Democrat, I want you to tell the president in 30 seconds why you're voting for him and for the first time ever, right, for a Republican ever.TERRELL: Yes, President Trump, I want you to listen to me. Give me call me later on. The first time ever in my entire life as a Republican, I'm voting for you. Now, maintain what you're doing in these Democratic cities, and I will go to those networks and battle those guys for you. You're going to win in November, I guarantee it. I'm out there with you 24/7.PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP\u00a0(via telephone): -- very much. And you have come a long way, Leo. I have to tell you.(LAUGHTER)TRUMP: I've been watching you, and I've always respected even on the other side.(CROSSTALK)TERRELL: I'm here, I'm here. I'm here, I'm here now. I'm here right now! I'm here.TRUMP: I appreciate it, I do. I will do that.TERRELL: Thank you. Thank you.TRUMP: Thanks, Leo. Really great.HANNITY: All right. Leo, Geraldo, thank you, Dan Bongino.All right. I think that might have been the funniest we've had.Mr. President, sir, thank you so much for joining us. I know it's been a busy number of days here for you.A lot of news to get to. I want to spend a lot of time on the violence, the safety, security of our cities.TRUMP: Yes.HANNITY: I want to talk about COVID a lot.Let's start with some breaking news, and that is that you earlier today decided to pull back on the convention in Jacksonville. You gave a reason. Can you give us the reasons again in more detail?TRUMP: Well, it's really the China virus. Call it COVID. Call it any one of a lot of different names.But we're setting an example. We don't want to have people so close together. We have had such enthusiasm. Everybody wanted to go there. We went to North Carolina. We wanted to do it there. It was all set. We were going to build a beautiful facility. And it got hit hard. And the governor then, really, he could have treated us better, Democrat governor.But we are actually opening up there. And then we will make -- we will make our ways. It won't be your typical convention. I can say that, but it's going to be very safe.And I thought I had an obligation not to have large numbers, massive numbers of people crowded into a room.HANNITY: I have been told, Mr. President, from sources of mine -- you can confirm if you like -- I guess maybe I'm not surprised, that you're entertaining ideas that I have heard tonight that would be pretty spectacular.Would you give us any insight into what they are?TRUMP: Well, we have some ideas, but it'll have to be different than your typical convention.We have just great enthusiasm in the party. I don't think we have ever had it, even more so than 2016. And you see what's going on with the polls.Since -- it's funny. Since I did a -- I made a speech at Mount Rushmore. And since that time, it's been really something. There's been -- I mean, before that, really. You have all of these fake, these suppression polls, and just like 2016, when they put out these phony polls, the media.But I will tell you what. It's -- that the enthusiasm this party has and that they have for their president, because we're keeping our cities safe. We want to go in. We can't understand.I heard you talking with the group. Really, that's a group of -- a great group of three people. But I heard you talking about the cities and the safeties of the cities.I have offered them all, every one of them -- and there's 10 of them. We're offering all of them, let us go in. We will clean it up. We will clean it up.Now, in Portland, we had to do it because that was -- that's -- they're anarchists. That's even -- that's a level that people haven't seen, but they're anarchists.And they were going wild for 51 days. And we went in. And they have done a great job. They were going to rip down the courthouse, a big federal courthouse, gorgeous federal courthouse.So, we went in. And we have been very, very strong. And we have this Mayor Whalen (sic), who I think is also -- he's also the police commissioner, as I understand it, in Portland.HANNITY: Wheeler, yes.TRUMP: Mayor Wheeler.And he's -- he made a fool out of himself last -- he wanted to be among the people. So, he went into the crowd. And they knocked the hell out of him. That was the end of him. So, it was pretty, pretty pathetic.But we want to go in and help the cities. We want to help Chicago. We want to help all of them. Detroit's having problems. A very good police chief in Detroit, but they have problems.We will go into all of the cities, any of the cities. We're ready. We will put in 50,000, 60,000 people that really know what they're doing. And they're strong. They're tough. And we could solve these problems so fast.But, as you know, we have to be invited in.HANNITY: Mr. President, I want to ask you about that.TRUMP: At some point, we're going to have to do something that's much stronger than being invited in. But we have to be invited in.Go ahead, Sean.HANNITY: The acting DHS chief, Chad Wolf, there are statutory reasons and justification to protect federal buildings. That is what has been happening, when you talk about 100 agents.We now have 15 mayors. We see this rise in homicides and shootings. One day right here on this program a couple of nights ago, 15 people shot in Chicago, last weekend, 70 people shot, 12 dead, a 10-year-old, 11-year-old shot.You spoke to Horace Lorenzo Anderson Sr. I know you invited him to the White House. He lost his 19-year-old son. We lost an 8-year-old little girl in the CHAZ Autonomous Zone in Atlanta, a 1-year-old in Brooklyn, a 7-year- old little beautiful young girl in Chicago.And they -- the one thing that all of these cities have in common, they have been run by liberal Democratic mayors, liberal Democratic governors for decades.TRUMP: Right.HANNITY: What do you say to the people? Most people would argue, you don't have a chance of winning New York, or Illinois, or California, or Washington state.TRUMP: Well, you're right.They're run by very liberal people, you could say radical left in some cases, in some cases, just liberal Democrats. And they're not taking care of their police. They're not respecting the police. The police do an incredible job. It's a very tough job. It's a very dangerous job.And these mayors and, by the way, governors and senators and congressmen, Democrat congressmen, they want to pass stuff to make the police -- they want to take all of their power away. And you will have a bad situation, where you will have a bad cop, a very bad cop. And they have no idea the problem they cause.But you have 99 percent great people that work hard and get paid not nearly enough. And the job they do is incredible. And these people are just taking all of their respect. They're taking their guts out. And it's a shame. It's a shame.And the police, they could do the job. In Seattle, they could. They knew that we were coming in. And they went in just before we got there. So, we were all set to move. But if we weren't going to go in, if they thought that we weren't coming in, it would still be bad.But those police can do the job. But the mayor and everybody tells them not to do it. The governor, they say not to do it. And it's a philosophy.And let me tell you, if Joe Biden ever got in, the whole country would be like that. We have a lot of great cities. We have a lot of very safe cities, great places, great states that don't have any problems. And they look at the things that they see in Chicago, and they look at what they're witnessing in Portland and all of these different places, and they can't believe what's going on.But we have -- we have great places. But we have some instances that nobody's ever seen.I spoke with the mayor of Chicago, Mayor Lightfoot, and had a great talk. But within minutes after that talk -- you just reported it tonight -- a couple of more people were shot. Young, very young children were shot.HANNITY: Sad. So sad.TRUMP: And it's a shame. It's a shame.And we could solve it. If they invited us in, we'd go in with 50,000, 75,000 people. We would be able to solve it, like you wouldn't believe, and quick. But they just don't want to ask, maybe for political reasons. But they don't want to ask. It's a disgrace.HANNITY: Let me ask you, Mr. President.I know a lot has been made over Joe Biden and his comments that he made. I know he's now backed off it. And he says, well, I said it before the other way. I don't know if he's just not remembering what maybe somebody else wrote in \"USA Today,\" for example, but he did say police have now become the enemy, when they're supposed to help people.And then a follow-up was, would you support re-appropriating the money? And he said yes, now, not using the term. Democrats seem to be walking back the term defund. But reallocation is the word he used. Well, that would be the same thing.Let me play it, so to remind our audience what he said.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOE BIDEN, D-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Surplus military equipment for law enforcement, they don't need that.The last thing you need is an up-armored Humvee coming into a neighborhood. It's like the military invading. They don't know anybody. They become the enemy. They're supposed to be protecting these people.So, my generic point is that...UNIDENTIFIED MALE: But can we agree that we can redirect some of the funding?BIDEN: Yes, absolutely.One of the things that we also need to be doing is fundamentally changing the way -- and I have been pushing it for years -- changing the way we deal with our prison system.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: Mr. President, I can remind people, you're the one that did criminal justice reform. Biden, as vice president, Barack, they did not. You did police reform. They did not.You also set record after record low unemployment. They added 13 million more Americans to food stamps, eight million more in poverty, and the lowest labor participation rates since the '70s. You set record low after record low for every demographic group.And we got Opportunity Zones, your biggest commitment in terms of money and length of time to historically black colleges. They didn't do any of those things.Your answer to what Joe Biden -- now he's now -- he's adopting the position of the, yes, police are the enemies, he's never said a good word, Bolshevik Bernie's economic agenda, AOC's New Green Deal agenda. He's pledging trillions of taxpayer dollars.And add to that, let's see, Beto O'Rourke and Pelosi, Schumer and Biden, 125 years in the swamp. Your reaction to his team?TRUMP: Well, it's all true.But one of the things you mentioned and he mentioned was the surplus military equipment. And when I came in, as soon as I came in, I distributed to all of the police departments all over the nation. We had hundreds of millions of dollars of -- sometimes new, but it was never going to be used.It was sitting in warehouses all over the U.S. And I delivered it all to police, free of charge, all to police. It was just growing dust. It was just -- just sitting there, just, I guess, paying rent or whatever they were doing in all these massive warehouses.And I got it all out to the police. And they were so thankful. And, you know, a lot of it was protective equipment. And they didn't want to do it, because they thought the police looked too strong, that it was sending a wrong signal to the police.But it was really protecting the police. And there was offensive capability, but there was a lot of protective capability. And it was really amazing to me, what -- that they wouldn't deliver it, they wouldn't -- they wouldn't do it.And I -- and I have gotten notes. I have gotten so many notes from the heads of the police departments, and even from the cops, just the guys on the beat, thanking me for all of the equipment that we send out. And we were never going to use it. It was growing old and growing dusty.So, that's a whole different way of thinking, but -- and when he -- when you talk about the Bernie Sanders thing, I think what Joe Biden -- and I don't think it was him. I think it was radical left people that are totally controlling him, like a puppet. I don't think it's him. I don't think he knows even what we're talking about.But when we talk about Biden, he's got a manifesto that he agreed to -- I call it a manifesto -- with Bernie Sanders for open borders and things that you wouldn't even believe. I mean, these are left-wing at a level that I don't think Bernie ever talked about to the same extent.You would think there's a negotiation, that Bernie would be brought to the right a little bit. I think Bernie went further left, and Biden agreed to all of this stuff.HANNITY: Let me ask you.Sir, I have been in talk radio for 33 years, believe it or not, since I began that journey. I have been blessed to work here at Fox. I'm now in my 25th year here. Politics is a passion of mine.Usually, you have candidates -- you're probably an exception -- what you say -- what you said in 2016 is what you did. You...TRUMP: Yes.HANNITY: In many ways, people haven't figured out you're very predictable, in the sense that, if you say it, you mean it, in my view.But, usually, people run to the base for the primary, and then they run to the center. Joe Biden has adopted Bolshevik Bernie's radical socialism, AOC's New Green Deal. We're talking about trillions of dollars he's now committing to both those things, redistribution, higher taxes.Then I mentioned Beto O'Rourke, and then Schumer, Pelosi and Biden have had 20 -- 125 years.Why, in this case, do you believe he's going harder left than any candidate I have ever seen in my lifetime, for sure?TRUMP: Because I think he's afraid of the people on his left.I think that, when -- these are very radicalized people. I mean, he's gone so far. He's given Bernie everything. Bernie can't even believe it. I heard Bernie's going around saying, I can't believe what we got.And this was a negotiation that was done very quickly.And, today, I saw President Obama with him. And remember this. I wouldn't be there if it weren't for those two. If they did a good job, I wouldn't -- you know, I ran. I ran against what they did. And I won.And nobody campaigned harder than President Obama. Somebody said, oh, Obama's coming, and I said, that's OK, we beat him the last time. I think he campaigned harder than Hillary Clinton did, if you want to know the truth. Remember I would always talk about here comes Air Force One? Obama was all over the place.But the fact is, Biden and Obama, I'm here, I'm in the White House because of them. If they did a good job -- people forget, but if they did a good job, and except for the China virus that came in, we were setting every record you could set for unemployment, for the stock market, every single record you could imagine.And then what we did, we rebuilt the military. We got rid of regulations at a level that no administration even in eight years or in one case, more than that, no administration has come close. And we've appointed -- you know, we will have almost, it could even be more, but almost 300 federal judges appointed by the end of my first term. That's a record. Nobody's ever done anything like that. And two Supreme Court judges, great ones.HANNITY: All right. Let me go to Joe Biden. I argue, and I've watched this and witnessed this my whole professional life, I think that the job you have, I believe, regardless of who is president, is the hardest job in the world. You have a lot of burdens on your shoulder, anybody that is president. And I think when they asked Reagan in 1984 in that question whether or not he had the mental alertness, the strength, the stamina to do the job, it was a fair question.He answered it in one line in the second debate against Mondale. Let me play some of the greatest hits of Biden and then Biden from yesterday. And I want your take on what is going on with Joe Biden. Let's play it first.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)(PHONE RINGING)BIDEN: The scale, the scale of the loss is staggering. I don't know whose phone that is. But the scale of the loss is staggering.It has been two months since Congress gave them that money.Introduce me?(INAUDIBLE)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: OK. Yes, sir.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Am I on?BIDEN: Good evening.Thanks so much for tuning in.Look, tomorrow is Super Thursday -- Tuesday, and I want to thank you all.I'll tell you all, I'm rushing ahead, aren't I?We hold these truths to be self-evident, all men and women created by -- you know the thing.My name is Joe Biden and I'm a Democratic candidate for the United States Senate. Look me over, you like what you see, help out.Do you agree with me? Go to Joe 30330.We choose truth over facts.Play the radio, make sure the television -- excuse me, make sure you have the record player on at night, the phone -- make sure that kids hear words.Poor kids are just as bright and just as talented as white kids.Donald Trump does pose an extra threat (ph) to this -- it's not hypothetical.Why in God's name should someone who is clipping coupons in the stock market make -- in fact, pay a lower tax rate than someone who, in fact, is, like I said, a schoolteacher and a firefighter?I'm sorry, I'm confused who I am talking to here. But anyway, whoever it is...And I had a nurse that -- nurses at Walter Reed Hospital who would bend down and whisper in my ear, go home and get me pillows. They would make sure they would actually -- probably nothing ever taught in -- you can't do it in the COVID time, but they would actually breathe in my nostrils to make me move.Wearing a mask is now a political statement? This is more patriotic. Why do you wear the mask? So you don't make somebody else sick. Sick. What is with this guy?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Steve (ph), that's our time.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: OK.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: Mr. President, I'm not a doctor, I won't play one. I don't see -- I think Joe Biden has aged dramatically since he has left office. He doesn't seem very alert. They seem to be protecting him and hiding him. We now have interviews that are being shut off by handlers. What is your reaction, sir?TRUMP: Well, in all fairness, I know people that are 90, 91, 92 that are sharp as a tack. Bernie Marcus, as an example, Home Depot, and others I know, numerous. But you know, I just -- it's hard to comment on somebody. He is an opponent. You have to be very sharp. I'm dealing with the heads of these countries. And every one of them is a world-class chess player. And if you are not 100 percent on your game, if you are not 100 percent sharp- plus, you've got a problem.I looked -- I looked at what we have in this country. I came in and I guessed it from before, but after I saw what was going on with horrible trade deals, horrible military deals, money being spent, it was being sent out like water. You see what I have done with NATO, $140 billion, but really much more than that. It increases every year where countries are now paying for what we are doing. It was so unfair.So many different things, I could go -- and you don't have enough time. I could go all night with it. But you have to be on your game. You have to be sharp. And you have to be tough. And if you are not, these guys are going to take you to the cleaner.And they will take you to the cleaners like you have never seen before. It is so easy. And he wasn't -- he wasn't the best in his heyday.Let's not kid ourselves. Everybody knows that. Everybody knows that. Senators will tell you that in his best he wasn't. But I see the statements he is making now. And I don't think he has much of a clue.HANNITY: Mr. President, when you spoke about canceling the convention in Jacksonville, you were very passionate about it today. And you said the timing is not right. And we knew there would be flare-ups. This virus is the worst since 1918. And you said today, I have to protect the American people. That is what I have always done. That is what I always will be -- will do, that's what I'm about. We can make this work easily.And you also reminded people the importance of masks. People say you haven't been as outspoken as maybe you should have been on masks. But there were people telling us, well-known experts, not to wear masks in March for crying out loud, and socially distancing.And the CDC just released last week that if people wear the masks, this thing could be gone in four to six weeks. And what can you add about therapeutics and what can you add about a potential vaccine? You mentioned Pfizer today.TRUMP: Well, you know, at the beginning, many people, many very respected people, I won't mention names, but many respected people were saying don't wear a mask, that they're bad. You touch your face too much, and you get your hands near your eyes and your nose and they are bad.And then all of a sudden, it was a big thing to get masks because I'm all for it. Look, whatever is going to help, if it was a five percent chance, a two percent chance, wear it. And I will wear it. I wore it at Walter Reed Hospital the other day.I went to the hospital. I visited soldiers that have been so badly injured in Iraq. And it is terrible, in Afghanistan -- I saw one that was so badly injured in Afghanistan.And, you know, we are largely -- we're down to a very small force in both places. We were serving as policemen over there. And we can police our own country, especially when you look at Chicago and you look at what is happening around our country. And, you know, we have done a lot. We have done a lot.But you have to -- we have to do -- we have to get our country back. We have to get rid of this horrible plague that hit us and it hit us hard. But it didn't just hit us. It hit the whole world, Sean.The whole world was hit. China allowed it to escape to Europe and to the whole world, including us. And they are suffering. There's tremendous -- you know, you don't see that too much in the news, but you have countries that are going through relatively what we are doing plus-plus-plus. It is horrible.And we make ventilators because we have become -- we have become the best in the world for the ventilators. We're making thousands a month. We are sending supplies all over. And we are in -- we are in great shape from the standpoint. But we have this thing that is very, very contagious. Nobody has ever seen anything like it. Very, very highly contagious.But if you take a look at a map, we have large sections of the country that are in great shape. And we are going to win. And we are going to win sooner rather than later. I will say this on the vaccines, we are doing well. We have the greatest companies in the world, including we are dealing with other nations. We are working very closely.And therapeutically, therapeutics are, I think, going to be fantastic. Frankly, I would like to have that first because you could go into the hospitals, give somebody a shot or do whatever you have to do, and they would get better right away. But we are doing very well therapeutically. And we are doing very, very well with vaccines.HANNITY: Well, we know new studies have come out, and I had Dr. Oz on my radio show this week, that hydroxychloroquine, used early with azithromycin and zinc, and you took a lot of heat over it, mortality rate cut in half according to the Ford study. He mentioned a local hospital, retrospective study in New York.Let me add, you tweeted out tonight: baseball is back. By the way, poor Dr. Fauci -- and I really do believe and people I think try to divide both of you, that he has tried his best. Dr. Birx has tried her best. All of the models and experts in many, many ways were so wrong. The one thing that remained consistent is the most vulnerable, the elderly, those with compromised conditions or immune systems and pre-existing conditions.So I ask you, you know, where are we with the vaccine, the therapeutics? How soon? And do you want every American, if they can't socially distance, to wear the mask? I selfishly want baseball and football to open so we can go. And I also want to protect grandmas and grandpas.TRUMP: I would like to see everybody, if they can't spread, if they can't have -- be socially distant, then I think they should probably put it on. And even if it's -- let's say it's a 50 percent chance or 25, because, again, people -- these same experts were saying, don't wear it, at one point. Now they're saying wear it. So let's go with them. What difference does it make?So let's say they're right and let's say there's a 50 percent chance or 25 percent chance, you're not going to lose with it. You're not going to lose with it. So do it.But, again, as I said, I really think you're going to have some answers very, very soon on therapeutics and also on vaccines. These companies, I'm dealing with them directly, I'm getting reports directly. They are very far advanced. They've already started testing. And what I have done is through the FDA, Dr. Hahn, and some great people, we have ramped it up to a level that nobody has ever seen speed like this.We could be two or three years out before we are doing what we are doing. We are already testing. We are actually doing the testing for vaccines and for therapeutics. That would have happened in a normal administration, I will say that that would have happened in two and three years from now.So we are way, way advanced. And I think you are going to have some very good answers very soon. They're going to come up with the answer.HANNITY: Mr. President, you are asking the American people in 103 days -- well, some will be voting early. By the way, I have information on my website hannity.com, early voting, how do you do absentee voting, who your congressperson is that's up for election. In 103 days, I say the American people, the ultimate jury. You are asking the American people for four more years. If you are given the four more years, what will this country look like, in your view, four years from now?TRUMP: So it's all going to be about America first. We always put other countries before us, which is so foolish and so horrible. And it has been so destructive for us. It's about America first. We will help other countries, but we want to take care of ourselves. We are going to be building factories. We are going to be bringing in shops like you've never seen. We were all set to do it until we got hit with the virus.Our troops will be home. The endless wars are already ending. Down to very few soldiers in -- as you know, in Afghanistan. Very few in Iraq. Syria is largely out except we kept the oil. We have oil there that we kept. I didn't want to leave the oil, we kept it. We took it over.We are going to be about jobs like you haven't seen. We are going to be respected. And we are now by other countries. They're respecting us more than they have in many, many decades. I will tell you that. We are going to have a wall that is complete. We're up to 257 miles on the new wall. And by the way, if we didn't have that wall in right now, you would have numbers in Texas and in California, in New Mexico like you wouldn't believe.But we built 257 miles of -- it's 450 but we are going to do about 537 miles altogether. And it will give a complete, beautiful wall on our southern border that has really helped.And the other thing is, we are going to start making our product. And I have been pushing this from before this happened. We are going to make things here. We will make them here. Right now China and many other countries are doing what we are supposed to be doing. They went, they became globalists, these great geniuses became globalists. And they really hurt our country.We are going to start making it here. As with Elon Musk, I said, Elon, build a factory in Texas. He just announced today they're building one of the biggest plants in the world, auto plant for Tesla, and it's going to be in Texas. And, you know, it's great. He called me up just a little while ago to say, I got it done. So that meeting, he got it done. But I was pushing that job very hard from Elon, because we work with him and we do a lot for him. And I said, it's time. And he was great. He's doing a good job.But the other thing we have done is Space Force. You know, we put it in, it's the first time in 76 years we have a new force. We have -- so important, the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, Coast Guard, and now we have the Air Force. It's so great. And it's so important. It's going to end up being one of -- at first, I didn't even talk about that on the campaign. This was after I got in office.I realized we need it. Because China and Russia were going to dominate space. And we can't let that -- and now we're going to be dominating space. They're not too happy about what we did with Air Force. But we have it. And -- with Space Force.So we have now Space Force, so important, and so many other things, Sean, regulation cuts, tax cuts, the biggest tax cuts in history, biggest regulation cuts in history. And we are going to continue that foreword. There are still many things we can do. But the bottom line is we are putting America first and we are making America better than it has ever been.You will see that. We are going to have a great year next year. We're going to have a great third quarter. And the nice thing about the third quarter is the results are going to come out before the election.HANNITY: You know, I've been saying to my audience on radio and TV that the biggest choice election in our lifetime. It's literally, you know, taxes higher or lower, deregulation, more regulation, law and order, lawlessness, amnesty or border security, judges, energy, trade, foreign policy, it seems like you are running against the team. And the team is Joe, Bernie, \"Bolshevik Bernie\" I call him, Bernie Sanders the socialist, AOC, Green New Deal, Beto, Schumer, Pelosi, so I think it is.I want to go back to baseball. You announced today you are going to throw out the first pitch at Yankee Stadium on August 15th. Dr. Fauci did not do too well tonight with the Nationals. Have you ever thrown out a first pitch before? Are you nervous about throwing out the first pitch? Derek Jeter once famously said I guess to George Bush after 9/11, if you bounce it, you are going to get booed.TRUMP: Yes, no, I have thrown out first pitches. I have agreed to do it for the Yankees on I think they are playing the Boston Red Sox. That is a great rivalry. And I will do it. It's great that baseball is back, and other sports are back. I hope everyone is standing. I hope they are not going to be kneeling when the flag is raised. I don't like to see that. That would hurt a lot of people in our country. They don't want to see that with the NFL or baseball or basketball or anything else. We want to -- there are plenty of places you can protest. You don't have to protest on the raising of our flag.So a lot of great things happening for our country. One other thing I want to say is, we have made incredible trade deals. And we are going to continue that along. Because we got taken to the cleaners by every country. Ally or non-ally, we were taken to the cleaners. And we will keep that going.HANNITY: Mr. President, Mark Meadows, your chief of staff, recently indicated that indictments could be imminent in the Durham probe. We have big breaking news tonight. I don't know if you saw the opening of the show, a document declassified by your director of national intelligence, John Ratcliffe, revealing the FBI agent who gave you that defensive briefing in August of 2016 used it as a cover to monitor you and Michael Flynn as it relates to Russia.Do you remember it? It also, I believe, puts Jim Comey in a position of being proven to have lied just like when he said to you at Trump Tower the dossier is salacious but unverified. But he swore that it was accurate and true when he signed the FISA application to spy on you and your campaign and take away Carter Page's rights. What is your reaction to this news? And your thoughts on where this probe with John Durham is going?TRUMP: Well, it's just more and more things that you see. And that's only what you see. It is really bad. It is a terrible thing that happened. It should never happen to another president. The fact is that President Obama and Vice President Biden, and the whole group of them with Brennan and Comey and McCabe and Lisa Page and Strzok, her lover, and beyond them, long beyond them, they spied on the campaign, using the intelligence agencies of our country, they illegally -- this is illegal as can be, this is treason, this is many things you can call it, they spied on the campaign of another party or presidential campaign.HANNITY: And the attorney general.TRUMP: Both before and after victory. Both before and after. Never been done before. It is so bad. If it were the other side, they would have been in jail for two years, and it would have been a 50-year term. But Obama and Biden knew everything, and they spied on the campaign of the opposing party, using intelligence.HANNITY: Do you -- well, this raises a question. Now we know what happened in the Oval Office on January 5th. Do you think that Barack Obama, the former president, Joe Biden, should have to answer for what we now know happened 15 days before your inauguration in the Oval Office? We have one minute, sir.TRUMP: That was just one meeting. There were many meetings. There was no way -- I understand the system very well, I understand being president very well, there was no way this could have gone out without -- gone down without President Obama knowing every single thing.And even Biden brought up the Logan Act with respect to General Flynn, a great gentleman who has been treated so horribly and still is. A lot of -- a lot of things have been learned. And what happened is a disgrace. Again, should never, ever happen to another president.HANNITY: Would you consider pardons for the people involved? In the last 15 seconds.TRUMP: I've looked at a lot of different people, they have been treated extremely unfairly, and I think I probably would, yes.HANNITY: Mr. President, thank you for your time. In 103 days, the American people will make the ultimate decision. Sir, we appreciate you always taking time for this audience. Thank you.TRUMP: Thank you very much, Sean. Thank you.HANNITY: All right. That's all the time we have left. My book coming out in 12 days.Let not your heart be troubled.Laura, I hit the post.", "comment": "", "topic": "TRANSCRIPT", "date": " July 23"}, {"cover": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/07/156/88/07_H2_1313_fw05_06302020.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "title": "Independence or nah?", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/politics/independence-or-nah", "subtitle": "American independence was such a catalytic event in world history that we really can\u2019t imagine what things would be like.", "keyword": "presidential election and trade war", "website": "Fox News", "author": "Chris Stirewalt", "content": ".If you could, like , turn back time, would you still want the 13 colonies to have declared their independence from Britain 244 years ago this week?For a lot of Americans on the eve of this year\u2019s Independence Day festivities, the answer seems to be very much in doubt. Only 17 percent of respondents in a recent  said they felt pride when they thought of the state of the country today. Seventy-one percent said they were angry, and 66 percent said they were afraid.\nWhat a horrible bramble of outraged anxiety. What a mess.Despairing about the future of the country is very much the thing these days. From the progressive left and the nationalist right, we hear more and more that the American system is too corrupt, too broken and too unresponsive to address the concerns of today. Even among normal people there is the strong expression that something has gone terribly wrong.Even if they would have wanted the colonies to break free, we get an increasing sense from our fellow Americans that given all of the failings of our nation and weaknesses of our system that it just hasn\u2019t been worth it.Like an Ikea bookcase with one permanently droopy shelf taunting you from the wall, America just hasn\u2019t been worth all the trouble we\u2019ve put in it. You can see the particleboard where you cracked the fa\u00e7ade with that stupid little Allen wrench. Maybe we should chuck the thing.\nMaybe we\u2019d be like Canada or Australia, our contented-seeming cousins who keep Queen  on their cash and still hum a bit of \u201cRule Britannia\u201d under their collective breaths. They don\u2019t have mass protests in the streets, people threatening each other with murder over wearing corona masks or a political climate as noxious as sulfuric acid. They have their troubles, but not like us.But we know that wouldn\u2019t have been possible for us. Had Britain, not the U.S., been the dominant power in North America for the past two centuries \u2013 presuming it could have done so \u2013 things would look very different here and there. How the continent would have been carved up, colonized and governed would have been so different, and world history right along with it.\nWe wouldn\u2019t be like Canada. Canada wouldn\u2019t even be Canada. The French \u2013 whatever they would be (if they even were) in a world without American independence \u2013 might even be holding out in some of their claims in the interior of the continent.\nAnd, of course, without the United States, it\u2019s not likely that we would have seen the amazing technological improvements that followed in the 19th and 20th centuries. Britain is good at governance but has a pretty lousy track record on innovation in the past 150 years. There might still have been a , but good luck getting a patent.\nAmerican independence was such a catalytic event in world history that we really can\u2019t imagine what things would be like. America is the  of the modern world. If you take it out, everything else changes.\n\u201cOkay,\u201d you might say, \u201cso what?\u201d America is, depending on your preferred set of antipathies, racist/sexist/socialist/lazy/unfair/weak/militaristic/cruel/coddled\u2026 and so on. The world would be different without America, yes, but is the status quo something worth perpetuating?\nHere you should ask yourself a couple of other questions. In what other large, developed nation would you prefer to live? You can skip the part where you imagine life on a Caribbean Island or slicing steaks on the Pampas.\nThere are six other countries in the world that had gross domestic product of $2 trillion or more in 2019: China, Japan, Germany, India, Britain and France. How are they doing on the perceived defects of America today? How\u2019s racism and sectarianism in Europe? How\u2019s inequality in India? How\u2019s sexism in Japan? How\u2019s life in China\u2019s police state?\nYou might prefer one of those nations other than China for cultural or lifestyle reasons, but not on any reasonable grounds are they not afflicted by the same woes of which America stands accused.In fact, without America, those countries, if they existed in any familiar forms in the year 2020 without America\u2019s help and protection, would probably be far less fair and far less egalitarian.\nAfter all, they got to be the way they were in substantial part by copying us. Our nation was for so long the envy of the world and our accomplishments so fulgent that the system derived by the men who declared independence \u2013 Mr. Madison\u2019s republic \u2013 became the preferred operating system for the world. A democratic republic with explicit protections of individual rights has been the open-source software that changed everything.Would it have inevitably just evolved? Would the world have eventually bumped into liberal democracy someplace else? Would the idea of natural, inalienable rights have worked itself out somehow without America?We wouldn\u2019t bet on it \u2013 certainly not enough to flirt with the possibility of a world without our nation. From the start and still today, America is indispensable.[]\u201cThis convention composed of men who possessed the confidence of the people, and many of whom had become highly distinguished by their patriotism, virtue and wisdom, in times which tried the minds and hearts of men, undertook the arduous task. In the mild season of peace, with minds unoccupied by other subjects, they passed many months in cool, uninterrupted, and daily consultation; and finally, without having been awed by power, or influenced by any passions except love for their country, they presented and recommended to the people the plan produced by their joint and very unanimous councils.\u201d \u2013 In honor of President \u2019s Fourth of July birthday, here is an excerpt from his  on the 150th Anniversary of the Declaration of Independence, July 5, 1926: \u201cIt was not because it was proposed to establish a new nation, but because it was proposed to establish a nation on new principles, that July 4, 1776, has come to be regarded as one of the greatest days in history. Great ideas do not burst upon the world unannounced. They are reached by a gradual development over a length of time usually proportionate to their importance. This is especially true of the principles laid down in the Declaration of Independence. Three very definite propositions were set out in its preamble regarding the nature of mankind and therefore of government. These were the doctrine that all men are created equal, that they are endowed with certain inalienable rights, and that therefore the source of the just powers of government must be derived from the consent of the governed.\u201d Email us at  with your tips, comments or questions.NATIONAL HEAD-TO-HEAD AVERAGE40.8 percent50.6 percentBiden by 9.8 pointsBiden \u2191 0.4 points; Trump \u2191 2 points[.]BATTLEGROUND POWER RANKINGS(270 electoral votes needed to win)(109 electoral votes): Wisconsin (10), Ohio (18), Florida (29), Arizona (11), Pennsylvania (20), North Carolina (15), Iowa (6)(180 electoral votes)(249 electoral votes)[.]TRUMP JOB PERFORMANCE 40 percent 55.4 percent -15.4 points\u2193 1.6 points[.]This week,  and  look ahead to Independence Day and touch base on their latest culinary feats after a long food-talk hiatus.

It was the second month of gains after a loss of more than 20 million in April, when the pandemic put a large swath of economic activity on ice. The unemployment rate fell to 11.1 percent, down from a peak of 14.7 percent in April but still higher than in any previous period since World War II. The rate would have been about one percentage point higher had it not been for persistent data-collection problems, the Labor Department said. There were still nearly 15 million fewer jobs in June than in February, before the pandemic forced businesses to close. And the survey was compiled in mid-June, before coronavirus cases began to spike in Arizona, Florida and several other states. More timely data, also released by the Labor Department on Thursday morning, showed that 1.4 million Americans filed new claims for state unemployment benefits last week, and more than 800,000 filed for benefits under the federal Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program.\u201d: \u201cPresident touted the record job gains in June Thursday, saying the U.S. was \u2018roaring back\u2019 as the economy attempts to crawl out of a crater left by the coronavirus pandemic. \u2026 \u2018Today\u2019s announcement proves that our economy is roaring back,\u2019 Trump said, adding that the government\u2019s response to the pandemic was \u2018working out very well.\u2019 The monthly job gains in May and June are historic, but the labor market is still facing a net loss of 14.7 million job losses from the coronavirus recession. About 2.7 million jobs were added in May and 4.8 million positions were added in June -- both a record. However, they came after an unprecedented 22 million job losses in March and April. Economists and analysts anticipate that the job figures will be volatile until a vaccine for the virus is developed.\u201d: \u201cPresident Trump and Democratic challenger  both set eye-popping fundraising records last month \u2014 but Biden\u2019s records were larger. The former vice president\u2019s campaign announced on Wednesday night that they, the Democratic National Committee and their joint fundraising committees hauled in a combined $141 million in June, which was by far the campaign\u2019s best monthly figure to date. Biden\u2019s campaign called it a \u2018jaw-dropping sum of money.\u2019 The presumptive Democratic presidential nominee\u2019s campaign also reported bringing in a combined $282 million with the DNC during the April-June second quarter of fundraising, which was another record. And officials touted that the DNC outraised their rivals for a second straight month. The announcement from Biden\u2019s team came just a couple of hours after the president\u2019s reelection campaign reported that they, the Republican National Committee and their joint fundraising ventures brought in a combined $131 million in June \u2014 and more than $266 million the past three months.\u201d: \u201cDonald Trump wasn\u2019t halfway through his speech in Tulsa, Okla., and Democratic ad makers in Washington and New York were already cutting footage for an air raid on the slumping president. \u2026[The] ads zeroed in on Trump\u2019s admission that he urged officials to \u2018slow the [coronavirus] testing down.\u2019 It\u2019s a reflection of a growing consensus among Democrats about what kind of hits on Trump are most likely to persuade swing voters \u2014 and which ones won\u2019t. As in 2016, ad makers are focusing on Trump\u2019s character. But unlike four years ago, they are no longer focusing on his character in isolation \u2014 rather they are pouring tens of millions of dollars into ads yoking his behavior to substantive policy issues surrounding the coronavirus, the economy and the civil unrest since the death of .\u201d: \u201cFormer Vice President Joe Biden continues to lead President Donald Trump by a wide margin nationally, a poll released Thursday shows, as the race for the White House stabilizes, at least for the time being, with Biden well in front. The Monmouth University poll shows Biden with a 12-point nationwide lead over the president, 53 percent to 41 percent among registered voters. \u2026 Thursday\u2019s survey highlighted one of Trump\u2019s major obstacles to reelection \u2014 the amount of the electorate which has made up its mind against him. Half of registered voters say they are not at all likely to support Trump, while 39 percent say the same for Biden. Whereas Trump benefited from a relatively unpopular opponent in 2016 when running against , Biden\u2019s favorability ratings this cycle present a different challenge. Forty-four percent of voters view the former vice president favorably, the same percentage that view him unfavorably. Trump\u2019s favorability rating, by comparison, is 17 points underwater.\u201d: \u201cJoe Biden is leading President Donald Trump by a 46 to 41 percent margin among registered and likely voters, according to a new poll by Susquehanna Polling and Research in partnership with FOX43. The poll, released Sunday, is similar to an April poll which showed the former Vice President with a 48-42 lead over Mr. Trump. The survey polled 715 voters statewide, 49 percent of which were registered Democrats, and 42 percent were Republican. However, of those polled, nearly a quarter identified their voting habits were more closely aligned with being an Independent.\u201d: \u201cThe country's top intelligence officials on Thursday held a classified briefing with congressional leaders amid demands for more information on the reports that Russian agents offered Taliban-linked militants in Afghanistan thousands of dollars in bounties for killing American troops. Top intelligence officials, including CIA chief Director  and Director of National Intelligence , held the briefing Thursday afternoon with members of the so-called \u2018Gang of Eight\u2019: Senate Majority Leader , R-Ky., House Speaker , D-Calif., and the top Republicans and Democrats on the two intelligence committees. \u2018Force protection is a primary purpose of intelligence. It should have the same importance to the Commander-in-Chief.\u00a0 Any reports of threats on our troops must be pursued relentlessly,\u2019 Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader , D-N.Y., said in a statement following the meeting. \u2026 Trump also has not directly addressed the substance of the reports nor whether the U.S. has or will respond to Russia.\u201dThis week Fox News Senior Judicial Analyst Judge explains how the Declaration\u2019s essence is that all persons have equal natural rights: \u201cThe Declaration\u2019s essence is that all persons have equal natural rights that no government can take away by legislation or command. Those rights can be used freely to pursue and defend life, liberty and happiness. Those rights can also be used to consent or not to consent to a government. \u2026 The government would not come about, of course, until the bloody war was completed. In reality, the real revolution was completed by July 4, 1776 because it was a revolution of minds more than of government. \u2026 Ah, but the revolution of men\u2019s minds -- the idea that the government was not legitimate unless consented to and limited, that individual personal freedom, not government power, is the default position; all of this was stirred up by the radicals, articulated by Jefferson, embraced by Congress, achieved by blood and acquiesced by the king -- was as much a change for our forbearers as was the violence against the British.\u201d More . - -  -  - \u201cThe optimist in me would say the odds of us getting a break in the future are greater because we\u2019ve had such a run of bad luck.\u201d \u2013  Email us at  and please make sure to include your name and hometown.: \u201cA highway in Virginia was backed up for nearly an hour Wednesday after motorists found themselves sharing the road with loose pigs wandering into traffic, video shows. The hogs were spotted on the southbound Interstate 95 lanes in Spotsylvania and Carolina counties around 1 p.m., the Richmond Times-Dispatch reported. , who was driving home when she came upon the scene, told the paper she saw four hogs in total. Some motorists and Animal Control officials were giving them aid. She estimated they weighed around 400 pounds each. It wasn\u2019t immediately clear how the pigs wound up on the interstate, nor were there any signs of damaged vehicles. At least two of the animals, however, appeared to have injuries. \u2026 State police and deputies with the Spotsylvania Sheriff\u2019s Department took control of the situation, closing the lane shoulder two spots south of where the pigs were roaming around, the Richmond Times-Dispatch reported.\u201d\u201cAmerica demonstrated its capacity for swift, decisive action.

Don't fall for the Roger Stone hysteria, just a distraction, just like the Russia bounty story.The president's power to commute sentences almost absolute. George Washington granted clemency to traitors. Andrew Johnson pardoned every single Confederate soldier. Gerald Ford pardon Nixon. Bill Clinton pardoned his own brother. That's what brothers are for. Bill Clinton pardoned the former C.I.A. Director and his business partner, Susan McDougal, and he pardoned the biggest tax cheat in U.S. history, international fugitive, Mark Rich after Rich's wife donated a half a million to Clinton's presidential library.Barack Obama commuted the sentence of Chelsea Manning, who conspired with WikiLeaks and the media loved it.But Trump commuted the sentence of Roger Stone who did not conspire with WikiLeaks and the media hated it. See what's going on here? There was never any evidence of collusion because there was never any collusion. Nobody has ever been charged with collusion or conspiracy with the Russians.Stone was charged in order to cover up a corrupt investigation. Trump's campaign was framed by the Democrats, the C.I.A. and the crooked F.B.I. agents we all know and love.They planted in doctored evidence. They used spies and foreign agents. They illegally leaked hatch stings and got caught.What happened was this. Roger Stone refused to get framed, so they tried to put them in jail. Stone refused to make up dirt about Trump, so they charged him with crimes. How sick is that?If police plant a gun on you, and then you throw it in the river, you shouldn't be charged with obstruction. That's basically what Mueller's boys did here.Stone should have just acid washed his hard drive like Hillary, right? Apparently, that's totally fine.If you tell your buddy not to cooperate with crooked cops because you're being framed, you shouldn't be charged with witness tampering. That's what they did to Stone.And Stone's buddy testified he was never even intimidated by Stone. They charged him with making false statements. You know, easy it is for the Feds to make that charge? That's the same charge they slapped General Mike Flynn with. Now, and new notes we just saw that the F.B.I. released to show that the F.B.I. didn't even think Flynn was lying.Stone told a so-called lie to Congress, but James Clapper can lie and get away with it. McCabe can lie to investigators and that's okay. Congress can lie to you, but you'll get locked up for lying to Congress.Schiff lied for three years that he had evidence of collusion -- false. But Stone said, I didn't collude -- true -- and he gets charged. You can't cover up a crime that never happened. Crooked investigations only produced crooked charges.You can't frame innocent people, investigate them for crimes they didn't commit, and then lock them up when they refuse to go along with your show trial.The jury foreman in the Stone trial was a raging Trump hater also. She was a member of the resistance. She is all over social media disparaging Donald Trump, she hates him, but she lies her way onto the jury and gets caught covering up her bias, so the jury is tainted, right? No. The Obama appointed judge is okay with it. What a joke.Now, I'll be honest. Stone is no saint. He has been playing in the gutter for decades. It doesn't make him a criminal though. He's just a political operator, and somewhat of an opportunist.There's guys like Stone all over the political world, on the left and on the right. Hillary paid for an operative millions to interfere in the election and smear Trump with Russian disinformation. She bought a warrant so Obama could spy on the Trump campaign. It was all fake. But the media doesn't talk about that, because they were in on it. That's 10 times worse than what they say Stone did.Now, I also don't want to hear Democrats in the media crowing about the rule of law either. As I said before, pardon power is perfectly legal. But here's the point, the left spent the last two months looking the other way at looting and encouraging mobs to rip down the public property in the middle of the night, statues.'The left let radicals create their own country in the middle of Seattle and didn't make a move on it until after two black Americans were murdered. The rule of law -- really?Biden's son was bribed by the Chinese and the Ukrainians. The Saudis were sending Clinton's foundation millions, then they murdered someone in their Embassy. Did Hillary send the money back?Did Comey uphold the rule of law when the F.B.I. doctored evidence to illegally spy on the Trump campaign?A Mexican national can illegally cross the border, commit a crime in San Francisco, and the city won't let I.C.E. pick him up and deport him. That's respecting the rule of law?The Democrats believe in mob rule, not the rule of law. That's why they're waging a war on the First and the Second Amendments. That's why when they tried to impeach the President, they jumped over the judicial system and rushed their case to the Senate instead.The media wants an old man to catch COVID-19 in prison and die behind bars. Really? They want hardcore felons sprung from jail so they don't get sick. But want a Republican with no prior record to rot and drop dead.The left is just mad because Trump sniffed out there witch hunt and stopped it.These were processed crimes and a baseless and politically motivated investigation. This was a dirty tricks hit job on Trump, because he was a threat to their power. They tried to criminalize the movement because it put America first.The movement put the people over the politicians, the swamp is going after Trump because they're really going after you, the voters, because you put him there.Trump represents change, the change you voted for, getting out of Syria, rebuilding America instead of Afghanistan, putting a stop to the Germans ripping us off, challenging the Chinese government thieves, shredding the dumb climate and trade deals, securing the border for American workers and keeping judges out of our business and politicians' hands out of our pockets.Stone is small potatoes compared to the stakes of the election. Free Stone, free Flynn, let Durham indict some bad guys, but we have to stop looking in the rear view mirror.The election is less than four months away. There's only three issues: jobs, China and Biden, a dangerous buffoon who is going to destroy everything Americans have been working towards.Trump is the jobs President. Biden is the mob president. Trump was elected because he was a businessman who was looking out for the working man after the Obama-Biden regime let foreign nations and illegal immigrants steal jobs -- good paying jobs, especially manufacturing jobs that were roaring back until the Chinese communists let the virus escape out of Wuhan into the world.The Chinese government lied, covered it up, hoarded masks, gouged us and then blamed us.Trump needs to confront China and rally the country around Made in the U.S.A. and hold the communists accountable.Bringing factories out of China and back to the America puts the foreign policy and the economic policy together. Protecting America from COVID-19 and punishing the source keeps Americans safe and focused.And now it's time to define Biden. He's a fool who can't be trusted with power. He's been a Washington politician his whole life and put America last during the Cold War and the war on terror.He let China and the Europeans eat our lunch while the forgotten men and women suffered. He never protected us from criminal illegals or ISIS, and he doesn't have the spine to stand up to the Bernie bros, AOC, Pelosi, Antifa, or the mob.Biden is an economic illiterate who lets lobbyists and the globalists write the rules and rig the game. Even his family members take advantage of Joe, because he's an easy mark.But don't let folksy good old Joe fool you. It is just a slick sales job by the pros. Biden's an empty suit for socialism.So the Trump campaign should be hammering away at what really matters. Boom, boom, boom. It's right there for the taking. No more distractions.Let's finish writing the American comeback story. There's not a lot of time left.Reaction to that in a moment, but first breaking news in China's coronavirus cover up. Here with that, former Trump White House chief strategist, Steve Bannon, the host of the podcast \"War Room Pandemic.\"All right, Steve, what are your sources telling you about Chinese covering up the virus?STEVE BANNON, FORMER WHITE HOUSE CHIEF STRATEGIST: Well, we know we're starting to have, Jesse, doctors, actually people associated with the Hong Kong lab and people associated with Wuhan, people associated with their entire biomedical and bio weapons defense industry start to defect and start to get information. There's a massive whistleblower campaign in China right now.People have to understand that Chinese people are the victims of the Chinese Communist Party. They've been the victims of this CCP virus, and they're starting to tell the story.Fox News broke an incredible story, I think it was yesterday with Dr. Yan, who is the first of many that are going to start to come out. Some of them are already out in Europe, the United Kingdom and other places.And you're going to start to see now the Intelligence agencies, the F.B.I., others start to put this together of what the real source of this virus was, how culpable the Chinese Communist Party is about this virus, particularly what they visited on their people and what they visited on the people in the United States.The Chinese Communist Party lied, 130,000 Americans died. We have an economic inferno in our country, an economic inferno around the world. We've blown up the balance sheets of the Federal Reserve and everybody else to try to bridge this in a smart way.That is all the responsibility of the Chinese Communist Party. They have to be held accountable, I think you're going to see a lot more Dr. Yan's start to come forward, and I think she's got a lot more to say.WATTERS: Oh, yes. So the defections are going to blow the lid off this thing. And the President needs to be much more aggressive in the way he confronts the Communist Chinese because they need to pay a price.Americans need to see them paying a price and they need to feel it, because that's going to unite the country around a common goal.So, what did you think about my analysis about the stakes in the election in terms of the economic policy, merging that with the foreign policy, and then defining Joe Biden as the bumbling buffoon that he is?BANNON: That that's the playbook right there. Look, the tell was the other day when Joe Biden who is the senator from Wilmington, Delaware, remember, he represents all the global corporations. He's been the biggest globalist in the Senate for 40 years.He pushed W.T.O. for the Chinese. He pushed most favored nation. He pushed NAFTA. You know, Chuck Todd said yesterday on an interview, it is kind of stunning to see Joe Biden trying to recreate himself as an economic populist and an economic nationalist.The reason is, that's where the country is. Donald Trump is a populist. He's an economic nationalist. He is the first President to confront China. But there's so much more to do.Right now in Hong Kong, President Trump ought to drop the hammer. That is Czechoslovakia in 1938. President Trump ought to cut them off from the U.S. dollar. He ought to sanction Hong Kong Shanghai Bank, Bank of China, CITIC, Penang Group, then ought to sanction individuals, Wang Xin and I think he ought to sanction President Xi.WATTERS: Wow.BANNON: President Trump ought to throw down. President Trump ought to throw down. Look, the Chinese Communist Party, they did this because he had built a striver's economy, it wasn't going to be pushed around.The Chinese Communist Party, coming out of that weapons lab and hiding it. We now know and Dr. Yan gives you a detailed analysis of how the Beijing C.D.C. knew this back in late December, early January of 2020, late December 2019.What she told Fox the other day is explosive, every paper in the world has picked it up -- I think you're just at the top of the first thing with her and there are many more like her that are going to start coming forward.Remember, people in China are decent and hardworking folks. They understand the brutality of the Chinese Communist Party. They understand that they are bad guys in a totalitarian dictatorship, and you're going to see, Jesse, many more things coming out.But I think you laid out the playbook. What I would tell the President, it is action, action, action. You're the protagonist in this drama.WATTERS: Right.BANNON: Drive the action. All Joe Biden could do is try -- Joe Biden has got to recreate himself in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan or Wisconsin. Those are your voters, Mr. President. Just complete -- drop the hammer. More Executive Orders on buy American and hire American.Remember, Joe Biden wants to give amnesty to 20 million illegals that will flood the workforce that will suppress wages for African-Americans and Hispanics. He also wants to have full medical benefits for illegal aliens. This will crush the budget.President Trump is both buy American and hire American, and now is the time, I think to drop the hammer on jobs, on China, on sinking the American way of life.WATTERS: Yes, and Sleepy Joe just completely plagiarized that out of the Donald Trump playbook.You've zeroed in on something that I don't think a lot of people realize though. So the Senator from Delaware -- Delaware is the state where all of the multinational corporations incorporate for tax purposes. So, he's been doing their bidding for decades, and that's what this is all about.The guy is just a car and he is being driven by powers that don't have the best interest of the American worker at heart and Donald Trump needs to point that out day after day after day.Now, strategically, when you have Joe Biden hiding in the basement, for a while, I thought maybe you know what, he is surviving in the basement. You know, maybe Donald Trump needs to smoke him out.And now I'm thinking, you know what? Let him stay in the basement. Let him not travel to swing states. Let him get rusty. Let him not see the country and just have them just roll in the debates, not in fighting shape thinking he's going to win like a boxer that doesn't train because the Vegas bookmakers have him ahead a few points. What do you think?BANNON: Look, I think that's one strategy. I also think if you want to smoke him out, it is not going to be rhetoric. You're going to smoke him out with action. Action, action, action on jobs, on EOs about jobs.Biden's line he tried to use in the present is that, all you care about is the stock market and the investor class. That's the biggest chutzpah I've ever seen.It was Joe Biden and Barack Obama that in their administration, we had the greatest concentration of wealth in world history from the crash of 2008 until Donald Trump took the oath of office. Donald Trump's economy, although we had a robust stock market, Donald Trump's economy was a striver's economy.Remember, it's the first time that working class people's wages were increasing more than people with college degrees. That's what we had before he --WATTERS: Donald Trump actually decreased the income inequality that was exacerbated during the Obama-Biden years. You know, everything's backwards, but I think -- I think that the playbook is out there to win this thing. It just needs to be simple and strong and you know, relentless day after day after day. Look, no tie band and I'm pulling the band look. What do you think?BANNON: Jesse, he's a man of action. He's a man of action.WATTERS: Right.BANNON: Jesse, all we need is action, action, action. Let Joe Biden try to recreate you himself when you're the guy you are. Thanks, Jesse.WATTERS: All right, thanks, Steve.Joe Biden, plagiarizing President Trump's economic plan. Here we go again. Up next, Rudy Giuliani on that.And later, the Epstein tapes starring some very famous politicians.

I graduated with three degrees from undergraduate school and 165 credits, only had 123 credits.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Biden now concedes he did not graduate in the top half of his law school class, that he does not have three degrees from college, and that he was not named outstanding political science student in college.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: \"Newsweek\" says Biden actually went to school on a half scholarship, ended up near the bottom of his class and earned only one degree, not three.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: That was Joe Biden years ago taking credit for things he didn't actually do. And he is at it again. He's just unveiled his plan for the economy and guess who it sounds just like?(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BIDEN: When the Federal government spends taxpayers' money, we should use it to buy American products and support American jobs.PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: In my administration, we live by two simple rules, buy American and hire American.Buy American and hire American.Buy American and hire American.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Even the name of this original economic idea, stolen. The slogan, Build Back Better was used by the United Nations back in April.Joining me now, former New York City mayor and President Trump's personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani. You know, we better be careful, he might start saying Make America Great Again.RUDY GIULIANI, PRESIDENT TRUMP'S PERSONAL ATTORNEY: I mean, Jesse, to listen to that is -- I can't understand how he is running for President.WATTERS: Me neither.GIULIANI: The first time I heard about Joe Biden was about 33 years ago. One of his law school classmates was my colleague in the U.S. Attorney's Office, eventually my Chief of Staff when I was Associate Attorney General, and he said to me, you should run for the Senate in Delaware. I said, why?He said, because anybody can get elected. Joe Biden was in my law school class. He was the dumbest guy in the class. He cheated his way through law school. He plagiarized at least once and cheated about four or five times.He's a nice guy, but he is so dumb it is going to take your breath away.And I've known him over the years and every time he'd make one of these mistakes, I would think about what I was told that he was dumb.And then of course, he plagiarized again. Remember when he plagiarized Neil Kinnock, he didn't just plagiarize him, he plagiarized his life.WATTERS: Yes.GIULIANI: He said that his family had never had anyone who graduated from college. They did. He said that they had worked in coal mines all their lives. Only one had worked for a coal mining company as an accountant. He completely plagiarized a man's life.The man is a pathological liar. He obviously has some kind of dementia or Alzheimer's. It's clear.And finally, I happen to know, he is a big crook. The family has been taking money for 30 years. They sell his office. They sold this office in Iraq. They sold his office in Ukraine, and they made a fortune in China.And you know, he always claims, well, I don't know. Meanwhile, his brother is becoming a millionaire. His son who is afflicted with unfortunately with drug addiction becomes a multimillionaire. And this money is for them. Of course, it's for Joe. It's to buy Joe's influence.And then he fixed the case in Ukraine, which the American media is covering up and attacking me over it, rather than going after the criminal, Joe Biden and his family.The guy is a total -- he is a total creation. I mean, it's like --WATTERS: Yes, but Joe Biden is a hot mess and everybody knows it, Mayor.GIULIANI: And now --WATTERS: And now you remember, he comes out and says, don't defund the police. Now, he has changed his tune. Now, he says, we need to redirect money away from the police, almost Clinton-esque. Listen to this soundbite.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BIDEN: Surplus military equipment for law enforcement. They don't need that. The last thing you need is an up armored Humvee coming into a neighborhood. It's like the military invading.They don't know anybody, they become the enemy. They're supposed to be protecting these people.So my generic point is that --UNIDENTIFIED MALE: But do we agree that we can redirect some of the funding?BIDEN: Yes, absolutely.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: So Joe has always been a patsy for the left. He was pulled away left on abortion, on energy, on reparations during the primary and now, he is getting pulled left again by the defund the police movement.I think the President just wants to pin him down on these things in the swing states.GIULIANI: Well, I mean, I worked with him on the Crime Bill of 1994 that provided 100,000 more police. So, this is a totally -- but I mean, I don't think Joe Biden actually at this point, even really understands completely what he is saying, which is really frightening.I mean, the Democratic Party is so cynical, they're running an incompetent -- mentally incompetent human being for President of the United States, which is similar to Mueller.I mean, they got a guy who doesn't have everything going, and they can use him like a patsy, and he is a patsy. He'll say anything AOC wants. He will -- this guy was pro-police.WATTERS: Yes.GIULIANI: Now, he wants to defund the police, which is part of the Marxist Black Lives Matter program, which, by the way is funded by a convicted terrorist, who I happen to convict, Susan Rosenberg who got 58 years in jail and was corruptly pardoned by Bill Clinton.The woman should be in jail right now. She was involved with the Black Panthers who floated police officers. So please don't be fooled by Black Lives Matter.Maybe a fool like Biden can be fooled by it. But intelligent people like the people listening to you should take a look at the three Marxist who founded it, and the terrorist who is funding it.WATTERS: And a lot of that money, you know, when you donate to Black Lives Matter does end up going to the Biden people because it goes through this little wholesale website.GIULIANI: It goes right through a terrorist. The money actually goes right through the terrorist.WATTERS: Exactly. So Joe has been taken advantage of by his family. He has been taken advantage of by the far left, he's been taken advantage of by China and other countries.Can you imagine the level of racketeering and corruption and swindling that's going to go on while Joe is in the White House, not knowing up from down? It's going to be a free for all on the American people. I'll give you the last word.GIULIANI: Well, you know, the only reason I can think that his family is letting him run is because they want to steal more money. They've already stolen millions and sold out the American people. If that were my father or brother, I'd take them off television.I would I would say, hey, Joe, it's time to throw in the towel.WATTERS: Yes, it's elder abuse. A lot of people say that.GIULIANI: You don't make sense anymore. You're making -- but unless, unless, unless I was a greedy crook, and I was looking to make even more money. I mean, they have made about $40 million or $50 million off of him.WATTERS: Yes.GIULIANI: Selling his office.WATTERS: No one wants to report --GIULIANI: They are selling out America.WATTERS: No one wants to report that.GIULIANI: Nobody wants to report it.WATTERS: Where's Hunter? That's all I'm -- where is Hunter, by the way, who knows?GIULIANI: It was never about Hunter. It was about bribing Joe.WATTERS: I know. I know. He is just a conduit. Exactly. He's the go between.All right, Rudy Giuliani, thank you very much.GIULIANI: Thank you.WATTERS: Liberals start the dumbest boycott ever, if you can believe it. Details ahead on that.And the government goes into the home of that St. Louis couple and seizes their rifle. Outrageous.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)JACKIE IBANEZ, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT: Live from \"America's News Headquarters,\" I'm Jackie Ibanez in New York. President Trump drawing harsh criticism for commuting the sentence of political confidante, Roger Stone.Democrats and even a few Republicans are calling for an investigation. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi saying legislation is needed to keep this from happening in the future, calling President Trump's actions quote, \"an act of staggering corruption.\"Meanwhile, presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, Joe Biden defining what his presidency would look like. Biden is pledging a sweeping economic agenda, saying it will go beyond anything Americans have seen since the Great Depression and the industrial mobilization for World War II.Biden is also promising to counter centuries of institutional racism.I'm Jackie Ibanez, now back to \"Watters' World.\"For all of your headlines, you can always log on to foxnews.com. You're watching the most powerful name in news, Fox News Channel. Have a great night.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)ROBERT UNANUE, CEO, GOYA FOODS: We're all truly blessed at the same time to have a leader like President Trump who is a builder. We pray for our leadership, our President, and we pray for our country.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Praise for President Trump from the CEO of Goya Foods sparking calls for a boycott from liberals. Imagine that. But that CEO refusing to apologize.Here with reaction Trump 2020 campaign senior adviser, Corey Lewandowski. Corey, like the top three inexpensive meals in this country for families, you have barbecue, you have pizza and you have tacos.There is no way the American people are not going into the grocery store, that little Goya Taka kit. They're not boycotting that. That would be like me boycotting hair gel.COREY LEWANDOWSKI, FORMER TRUMP CAMPAIGN MANAGER: You know, Jesse, look, I hope every person who supports this President and loves their country goes out and buys some of their products.You know, this guy, the only word that comes to mind for me is cojones. This guy stood up to the left. Right? I don't know Spanish, Jesse, but I think that means that that guy is tough. Okay.And what that means is when he went and saw President Clinton, I'm sorry, President Obama at the White House, he was praised. He was jeered. He was a CEO that everyone should admire and respect. He goes and sees President Trump in the Rose Garden, and all of a sudden, you know, the left want to boycott him.This is the hypocrisy of the media, and I think the Trump train is going to come through and Goya's profits are going to go through the roof because of it.WATTERS: Yes. I mean, if you look around out there, I don't think Americans are giving up any meals, if you know what I mean.This reminds me of what Kanye West said the other day, Corey. He was talking about how the Democratic Party uses threats to coerce minorities into staying in the Democratic camp, and this is what that is again.Instead of persuading minority business owners with results or words, they're trying to go after their bottom line with intimidation. That's because the liberals have failed the minority community. And so they have to keep them in line with threats like this.LEWANDOWSKI: Well, Jesse, there's two approaches always. There is the carrot approach and the stick approach and the Democrats always want to use the stick, which is we're going to go after you if you even step out of line or you have an independent thought.Here's what the President has said, I'm going to deregulate the government so you can grow your business regardless of how you own it. I'm going to have empowerment zone, so we're going to put more money into minority communities.This President uses the carrot. It's two very different ways of doing things. We know the President's way works, but if you're not on Team Liberal, if you're not on Team AOC, you're not on Team Hate Trump, then we're going to use the stick against you and you'll be penalized for not supporting the Democratic line.WATTERS: Yes, Corey. I think they're scared because the President is making strong inroads in the Hispanic community. He is up 10 points to where I guess he was against Crooked Hillary. Biden is losing support with Hispanics. So they have to use these types of threats and this boycott movement.Cancel culture, Corey. That's what this is about. You've been canceled before, haven't you? You're always getting canceled.LEWANDOWSKI: Jesse, it looks like we canceled your time tonight. Look, Rudy and I are the only guys who bring in a class to the show.Between you and Bannon, you couldn't find a tie tonight? You guys got canceled on the tie.WATTERS: Sloppy Watters. That's what they call me.LEWANDOWSKI: No, good, Jesse. No, good.WATTERS: All right. I'll try to clean it up next week. Corey Lewandowski, everybody. Thank you.LEWANDOWSKI: Thank you.WATTERS: A liberal prosecutor sends police into the home of this St. Louis couple to take away their weapon. This is what the founders warned us about. A full report ahead on that.But first, a jewel thief says the Epstein tapes are real and he's seen them, next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WATTERS: New claims coming out about Ghislaine Maxwell from a jewel thief. He says Maxwell bragged about having video of at least two high profile politicians and other powerful figures, and that he has seen the tapes himself.An attorney for Prince Andrew accuser, Virginia Roberts says the Prince is one of them, and Roberts says, he should be worried.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)VIRGINIA ROBERTS GIUFFRE, JEFFREY EPSTEIN ACCUSER: We weren't anything important to them at all. We weren't even a human being to them. We were just another toy to be passed around. And that's what they did.Prince Andrew should be panicking at the moment because Ghislaine doesn't really care about anyone else but Ghislaine.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: So who else should be worried? Joining me now, Daniel Halper, co- author of the book \"A Convenient Death: The Mysterious Demise of Jeffrey Epstein.\" I've read it. It's excellent reporting by him and his co-author.All right, so this guy is a jewel thief. You can kind of judge the veracity for yourself. He told a tabloid in Great Britain about this. So this is what he said.He said, you know, Ghislaine and Epstein kind of boasted to him about owning powerful people. He said he saw videos of powerful people, celebrities, world figures, in videos having sex, threesomes, even orgies with minors. He saw videos and photos of people having sex with various young girls, and there is footage of two very high profile society figures with an underage girl and the two American politicians in videos with minors.You've done some reporting on Epstein and Ghislaine, what do you make of this, Daniel?DANIEL HALPER, AUTHOR: Well, listen, I can't vouch for his precise claims, obviously, but it's very consistent with what we know. We know that Ghislaine Maxwell was a procurer for Jeffrey Epstein. That's been alleged by many victims.And we know, worse that she partook in the sexual crimes against these women in many cases.I think one thing to consider is that Ghislaine Maxwell herself was found in America, and I think it's a very striking point. Why was she here in America when she had two other passports, in addition to an American passport? She had $20 million. She could have gotten anywhere in the world.And I think the answer is pretty obvious. She didn't fear getting caught here. She hadn't gotten caught for so long. The Feds had showed no interest in her for so long, and she had gotten away with her crimes.She clearly has something over some powerful people's heads that was able - - that allowed her to run free for so long. And I think it's very good that she is being brought to justice and hopefully, she does cooperate with prosecutors and they try to get to the bottom of this.WATTERS: Yes, I mean, she's in a horrible cell in a correctional facility, and they're not going to let anything happen to her after the mistake they made with Epstein.So, you've reported and other people have reported that every single property he owned from Paris to the Virgin Islands, in Mexico, Palm Beach to Manhattan was wired. Like this was like the real world house. This was this -- this was like, you know, the \"Big Brother.\" You have cameras in every single corner.So if you're a high profile individual and you ever went to an Epstein property over the last couple decades, and you did anything inappropriate with any underage person, there will be surveillance footage backed up somewhere on a hard drive which we have to assume the F.B.I. seized during their raids when they went after Jeffrey and took him into custody.The amount of explosive evidence that we're looking at here, and if this really is true that you're talking about well-known politicians and society types, does she have leverage if the F.B.I. already has the tapes? I guess the only leverage would be that she could testify against people.HALPER: Yes, look that's obviously a legal question. And then of course, there may be other situations of which there's not footage. There were accusations that some of these things took place in Ohio, for instance, that we don't -- that there hasn't been alleged that it is very well wired.I think one of the interesting things about Jeffrey Epstein's wiring of his place and a lot of victims and friends of his have claimed that is that Jeffrey Epstein would allow people at some point to know that they were filmed and that they were wired.It's very interesting. It wasn't just that he had everything on camera. He wanted people to know and I think he did it.WATTERS: Well, let me ask you this because you did some reporting quickly about questions about his ties to foreign intelligence activities. Ghislaine's father was alleged to have had some sort of ties to Israeli Intelligence, I think you reported.There's always been questions about Epstein's role in compromising people for a foreign country. Do these tapes kind of lead you to believe that?HALPER: They've led many people to believe that. I think there are very serious questions. Why did he evade the law for so long and people like Alex Acosta, when he was coming into the Trump administration, he told people in the Trump administration allegedly that he couldn't touch Epstein because he was tied to Intelligence.WATTERS: Wow.HALPER: So I think Bill Barr should be transparent about what's going on, given what's happened to Jeffrey Epstein. I think we should know what's going on, and I think that would be very helpful in getting justice hopefully.WATTERS: Yes. Because that's what this is about. This is about justice for these underage victims.All right, great reporting. Dan. Thanks again.HALPER: Thank you, Jesse.WATTERS: St. Louis homeowners have their rifle removed from their home by force. A dark day for the Bill of Rights in America. That shocking story, next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MARK MCCLOSKEY, ST. LOUIS MAN WHO DEFENDED HIS HOME: Seemingly, everybody in the world came forward. Literally, I think the estimate is 300 to 500 people came right towards us.PATRICIA MCCLOSKEY, ST. LOUIS WOMAN WHO DEFENDED HIS HOME: They were going to kill us. They were going to come in there. They were going to burn down the house. They were going to be living in our house after I was dead and they were going to -- they pointed to two different rooms and set up, that's going to be my bedroom, and that's going to be the living room and I'm going to be taking a shower in that room.And then the dog barked. I mean, there were so many threats and then the dog barked and they said and I'm going to be killing her, too.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: Patricia and Mark McCloskey, the St. Louis couple forced to protect their home from protesters now unarmed. Police went into their home and took their rifle, and the pistol reportedly already handed over to their former attorney.But the couple was not arrested or charged. So what the heck is going on here? Joining me now with that by phone, former Florida Attorney General, Pam Bondi.So Pam, this crackpot DA out in St. Louis. She is running in a primary for re-election. She's a total joke. And I guess she got a judge to sign off on a warrant to send police in there to take this guy's rifle away from him. It's very unclear for what reason. This is like the red flag law without the red flag. How is this legal in this country?PAM BONDI, FORMER FLORIDA ATTORNEY GENERAL (via phone): It is not legal, Jesse. I've been a prosecutor as you know, my whole career and then Attorney General. This is an extreme abuse of power by this prosecutor, and this is a glimpse of what a Biden administration would look like.They want to take away our gun. That couple that you're showing on TV, they were defending their lives and they were defending their property, within Missouri under the Castle Doctrine, they had every right to do.These people weren't peaceful protesters. They crashed through their gated community. Armed -- armed -- came up. They told this couple, they were going to kill them. Kill them. They were even pointing out what bedroom they were going to live in, in this couple's home. They were going to kill the couple's dog.Look at them on this footage. It is outrageous.WATTERS: Yes.BONDI: These are good American citizens, Jesse. Look what they did. I'm proud of them.WATTERS: Yes, I mean, you're right about the law. There's the Castle Doctrine where you can defend your home. They have open carry in that neighborhood.BONDI: That's right.WATTERS: They have stand your ground there. These were legally purchased weapons. They have the right of the Second Amendment to have these weapons to protect their property and to protect their life.What it looks like to me is this ridiculous District Attorney whose conviction rates just dropping like a rock. She is not getting anything done. She's actually just let looters and rioters off the hook, no charges at all.There she is right there. Her name is Kimberly Gardner. She's funded by George Soros. This just looks like a political play to me to win votes. But I wish I knew more about this. It's just clearly unconstitutional. I'm outraged by it.I mean, this is the United States of America, you have the right to bear arms.BONDI: Jesse, every American should be outraged by this, every single American. This is our most fundamental right and not only that, they are protecting themselves. These people are protecting themselves outside their own home on their own property.WATTERS: Right.BONDI: This isn't even close to being legal. He had no legal basis to go in and seize their firearm. What about the people who came in there armed? The couple said those people were armed. They are the ones who should be under investigation.Let me tell you, we dealt with a Soros funded attorney, a District Attorney or state attorney in Florida in Orlando, and he is now no longer running for office. He wasn't prosecuting cases the way he should have. But that's what happening. George Soros around this country is funding these political prosecutors.WATTERS: Yes. They are putting everyone in danger, and they're just shredding the Bill of Rights. I mean, this is the country was founded upon, some of these rights. And the government can't do that. It's just not right.All right, Pam, thank you.Up next, Last Call.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WATTERS: It's a big week for birthdays. On Thursday, I turned 21. That's right, I can drink now. I celebrated with Emma who made it a very special day. Oh, aren't we cute?And tonight marks nine years of \"The Five.\" I've been lucky to be a part of that incredible team for more than three years rating stronger than ever.

Thank you for joining us. Welcome to \"Sunday Morning Futures.\" I'm Maria Bartiromo. Crime, coronavirus and China dominating the headlines this morning, as Congress scrambles to hammer out the next federal stimulus package before millions of Americans lose their extra unemployment benefits at the end of the month, all this against the backdrop of the 2020 election now just 99 days away. President Trump canceling all GOP events in Jacksonville, while asserting himself as the law and order candidate, dispatching officers to Portland, as well as more force in Seattle and Chicago. Just ahead, acting Secretary of Homeland Security Chad Wolf is here to tell us what the federal government is doing to restore safety to our nation's cities, as protesters target his own home. This as newly declassified documents reveal the FBI used counterintelligence briefings as a cover-up to investigate the Trump campaign. Senator Lindsey Graham is here with the very latest on his Russia deep dive, as he prepares to grill former Attorney General -- assistant General Sally Yates before the committee on Wednesday. We're joined this morning by Congressman Devin Nunes with more breaking news on the Steele dossier. He will reveal it right here for the very first time coming up. And in the middle of all of this, Beijing busted this week for spying on U.S. soil, after three Chinese nationals were arrested trying to steal medical research, a concern you heard here from Senator Tom Cotton, flagging this on this program in April. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. TOM COTTON (R-AR): I have little doubt that the Chinese intelligence services are actively trying to steal America's intellectual property as it relates to the virus that they unleashed on the world, because, of course, they want to be the country that claims credit for finding those drugs or finding a vaccine, and then use it as leverage against the rest of the world. (END VIDEO CLIP) BARTIROMO: Global investor Ray Dalio is back with us today with his assessment of the China threat and why it hasn't stopped him and others from investing there. All that and a lot more, as we look ahead today on \"Sunday Morning Futures.\" But, first, new revelations this week about Christopher Steele and his bogus dossier paid for by Hillary Clinton's campaign and the Democratic National Committee. Newly declassified documents providing even more evidence that the FBI knew that there was no collusion as early as January of 2017, but they kept investigating Trump and his campaign anyway and renewing warrants to do so. This just the latest domino to fall, with more bombshell documents expected any day now. White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows breaking that news right here with us right here last week. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MARK MEADOWS, WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF: We know that they not only knew that there wasn't a case, but they continued to investigate and spy -- and, yes, I use the word spy -- on Trump campaign officials, and, actually, even doing things when this president was sworn in, and after that, and doing it in an inappropriate manner. You're going to see a couple of other documents come out in the coming days that will suggest that, not only was the campaign spied on, but the FBI did not act appropriately as they were investigating. It's all starting to come unravel -- to unravel. And I tell you, it's time that people go to jail and people are indicted. (END VIDEO CLIP) BARTIROMO: Joining me right now to talk more about that is Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham. Mr. Chairman, it's great to have you once again. Thank you so much for being here. SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-SC): Thank you. BARTIROMO: A big applaud goes to you for declassifying documents over the last week and really getting to the news and the truth. Thank you, Senator, for doing that. I know that our audience is grateful. GRAHAM: Thank you. BARTIROMO: I want to talk about what you declassified. And, certainly, you have articles in this from The New York Times, where we see Peter Strzok, FBI agent... GRAHAM: Right. BARTIROMO: ... marking off the articles, saying there is absolutely no evidence of this. Tell us about the report that you declassified from the FBI which is based on an interview with the subsource of Christopher Steele. GRAHAM: So, there's two things that we declassified so the public could understand how corrupt Crossfire Hurricane actually was. Number one was a memo written by an intel analyst who spent three days interviewing the Russian subsource. I don't know about you, but I always thought the Russian subsource was somebody based in Russia in the bowels of the Russian government risking their lives, trying to get information out to the Democratic Party. The Russian subsource, we now know, was on the payroll of Christopher Steele. And he also had a working relationship with the Brookings Institute. And we have learned from the memo that we declassified that the Russian subsource, who was American-based, not Russian-based, told Christopher Steele: Here's what I have got. It is bar talk. It's rumor. It is innuendo. It is not really reliable. And what did Christopher Steele do with that? He turned it into a Tom Clancy novel. He sold it to the FBI. They sold it to the FISA court to get a warrant against Carter Page. And what does this memo show? Then, in January 2017, when they found the Russian subsource, who was in the United States, he disavowed the dossier as being reliable. The FBI knew it, did a 40-page memo. But the FBI continued to lie to the court, getting new warrants based on the dossier in April and June of 2017. After they knew it was a bunch of garbage, they continued to use it anyway. Somebody needs to go to jail. BARTIROMO: So, tell me about the criminality, because... GRAHAM: Yes. BARTIROMO: ... if that subsource told the FBI agent, this is all bar talk... GRAHAM: Right. BARTIROMO: ... this is all hearsay... GRAHAM: Yes. BARTIROMO: ... why didn't the FBI stop renewing warrants to spy on Carter Page? GRAHAM: That is the central accusation that I'm trying to find out. I'm doing oversight. Durham is doing a criminal investigation. Here is what I can tell you, that Peter Strzok new that the subsource was not reliable. In the notes that we declassified where Strzok is commenting on the February 14 New York Times article, he indicates in there that Steele does not have insight into the reliability of the subsource. So, that tells me that Strzok knew about the interview with the subsource in January, where the subsource says it is all bar talk and hearsay. So, Strzok has a duty to report to the court exculpatory information. He has a duty to notify his superiors that the key document to get a warrant against Carter Page, the Russian dossier, is no longer reliable. I find it impossible to believe that McCabe and Comey were not made aware of this 40-page memo. Think about it for the moment. What's the odds that somebody would go to the trouble of writing a 40-page memo, shredding the reliability of the Russian dossier, and not tell other people in the FBI about it? I think there's zero chance that happened. And anybody that knew that the Russian dossier was unreliable and continued to get a warrant against Carter Page based on that document should go to jail for defrauding the court. BARTIROMO: So, you are calling witnesses down to get interviewed in front of your committee. GRAHAM: Yes. BARTIROMO: You have got Sally Yates coming soon. GRAHAM: Yes. Right. BARTIROMO: Are you going to call Jim Comey and Andrew McCabe? GRAHAM: Yes, absolutely, at the end. But I want to call Sally Yates. But let me tell you who I want to call for sure, is, I want to call the person who prepared the memo. I want to call the case agent who interviewed the subsource for three days in January and ask him, oh, by the way, did you tell anybody above you that the dossier is a piece of Russian disinformation? They're laughing their ass off in Russia. This New York Times article that somehow the subsource has been compromised, nobody in Russia is mad at this subsource who is U.S.-based, because the subsource took a bunch of Russian disinformation, sold it to Christopher Steele, who sold it to the FBI. What happened here is that Russian disinformation was used by American law enforcement in weapons form to go after a sitting president. They're laughing their ass off in Russia about this. They would give this guy a medal. BARTIROMO: Mm-hmm. So, tell me about the Sally Yates interview. That is happening on August 5. GRAHAM: OK. Right. Right. BARTIROMO: That is coming up. What do you want to find out from Sally Yates? GRAHAM: Three things. Three things. Ms. Yates has previously testified that she met with President Obama and Vice President Biden, I think it was Comey and Brennan and a few others, to talk about the ongoing surveillance of General Flynn, who was the incoming national security adviser. At that meeting, she learned for the first time -- and she is number two at the Justice Department on January the 5th, 2017 -- that the FBI was surveilling General Flynn. What shocked her the most is that Obama knew about it, and she didn't. Now, what do I want to ask her? I want her explain to us, how is it possible the president of the United States knows about a surveillance of the incoming national security adviser, General Flynn, and you didn't? And did she hear Vice President Biden mention whether or not Flynn may have violated the Logan Act? And I want to under -- I want her to explain to us what kind of system is in place? On January the 4th, the FBI agents in the field recommended dropping General Flynn from Crossfire Hurricane because there was no there there. So, really, what I want to hear from Flynn is, how could Obama know and she didn't? And did Biden mention that we should be looking at Flynn in terms after a Logan Act violation? If he said that, that is contrary to what he has been saying publicly. BARTIROMO: Well, what did they also say -- what did the FBI say to Congress? Because I remember John Brennan being interviewed... GRAHAM: Stay tuned. (LAUGHTER) BARTIROMO: ... in testimony to -- in front of Trey Gowdy. GRAHAM: Yes. Yes. BARTIROMO: And he said to Trey Gowdy, we did not use the dossier. It was a small part of the overall mosaic. GRAHAM: Right. BARTIROMO: What about the FBI and what it told Congress? Is lying to Congress a 10-year felony, as Trey Gowdy has said on this program? GRAHAM: So, stay tuned. Next week, you are going to learn more. Not only do we now know that the FBI lied to the FISA court about the reliability of the dossier. They told the court that the subsource was truthful and cooperative and Russian- based. The truth of the matter is that the subsource was American-based. He was an employee of Christopher Steele, who was on the payroll of the Democratic Party. And he told Christopher Steele, this is all a bunch of hearsay. And when the FBI understood that the dossier was no longer reliable, they continued to use it. But we also now have found -- and this will come out next week -- that Congress got suspicious about the Russian subsource and the reliability of the Steele dossier and that members of Congress asked to be briefed about it. I will tell you next week what I found. And here is what I think I'm going to be able to show to the public. Not only did the FBI lie to the court about the reliability of the Steele dossier. They also relied -- lied to the Congress. And that is a separate crime. BARTIROMO: So, that is a second criminal -- that is a second criminal act, then? GRAHAM: And this is in 2018. So, again, I want to emphasize this, that the Congress got suspicious, the Intelligence Committee did, about Steele and the reliability of the dossier. The intelligence community did not want to include the dossier in the intelligence assessment provided to President Trump about the 2016 campaign because they didn't trust it. So, they started asking questions at the FBI in 2018 about the subsource and how reliable this information was. And I found the notes that the FBI used to prepare that briefing. Mr. Horowitz told us about them. I found them. Stay tuned next week. You're going to find, not only did the FBI lie to the FISA court. They lied their ass off to the Congress. BARTIROMO: Unbelievable. This is more breaking news. We will follow your reporting next week, Senator. (LAUGHTER) BARTIROMO: Real quick, before you go, you have been knee-deep on working on another package for the shutdown and the coronavirus response. GRAHAM: Yes. Right. BARTIROMO: Are we going to see you pass something before the Senate leaves on August 8? What is the conversation now about those unemployment benefits, which will go away on July 31? GRAHAM: Well, here's the problem we have. Seventy percent of the people, almost, on unemployment are making more unemployed than they did when they worked. We need to change that. State benefits are trying to replace 50 percent of lost wages. What Mnuchin wants to do is have a federal benefit to take it up to 70 percent. Our goal is to give you 70 percent of the money you lost by being employed, not to give you a pay raise in unemployment. We have got to fix that. We have got to take care of kids. We have got $100 billion in this package to safely get kids back to school. And hospitals are beginning to be overrun again by new admissions. So we have got money to help our health care system. Half the Republicans are going to vote no to any phase four package. That's just a fact. And a lot of Democrats are going to insist on $3 trillion, which would be way too much. It would be wasted money. I'm confident that President Trump will lead us to a solution where we have money for kids, jobs, and health care. We need to stimulate the economy. We need a phase four. And I think we will come together before August the 5th to get this done. BARTIROMO: All right, we will leave it there. We will be watching. Lindsey Graham, thanks for your leadership in all of this. We appreciate your time this morning, sir. Thank you. GRAHAM: Thank you. BARTIROMO: Senator Lindsey Graham joining us there. A quick break, and then coming up, acting Secretary of Homeland Security Chad Wolf is here live on what the federal government is doing to do to restore law and order across our country, with some mayors saying they're just not welcome. Back in a minute. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Crime and vandalism besieging downtown Portland overnight, as the city enters a 60th straight day of often violent protests over the death of George Floyd. President Trump deployed federal officers there to restore law and order, facing opposition from local lawmakers who are demanding they leave. Acting Secretary of Homeland Security Chad Wolf has been leading the federal response in Portland. He joins me right now. And, Secretary, it is great to have you this morning. Thank you so much for joining us. And, certainly, your leadership on all of this is critical. Please explain to us the difference in terms of what is happening in Portland vs. the response to other cities across our country where there is also crime and vandalism and in need of law and order? CHAD WOLF, ACTING U.S. SECRETARY OF HOMELAND SECURITY: Well, thanks for having me on this morning, Maria. What's going on in Portland is very different than any other city across our country today. What we have in Portland is, every night, again, between midnight and 5:00 a.m., you have anywhere from 2,000, 3,000, upwards to 4,000 violent individuals targeting federal property, the federal courthouse there in Portland and federal law enforcement officers. They are arriving every night, using city streets and city parks. They're coming armed with rocks, bottles, basketball bats, power tools, commercial- grade fireworks, eliciting that violence, and targeting their violence on federal courthouse and federal law enforcement officers. That is very different than what is going on in Chicago -- places like Chicago, Albuquerque, Kansas City. That is where you see normal criminal activity, street crime, what we say, regarding gangs and drug dealers. And, again, President Trump and the administration, led by the Department of Justice, is targeting that type of crime. But, again, Portland is very different. What we see in Portland is a city, at least at certain hours of the night, completely out of control. We see city leadership there has fostered an environment that allows these criminals to do this throughout the night, untouched, absolutely untouched. It is time for Portland to join other responsible cities around this country, working with federal law enforcement, to address this violence. Just last night, Maria, we had protests across the country. We had some violent protests taking place in Seattle, in Oakland, in other cities. But what we saw there is, we saw local and state, federal law enforcement -- working with federal law enforcement, addressing those issues, without major incidents. We need Portland to step up to the plate, do their responsibility, and work with us to address violent criminal activity occurring every night. BARTIROMO: Well, what if they don't, Secretary? Something has got to give, right? This is going on every night that Portland looks like Baghdad. And they are pushing back on officers. These people can go all the way up to the fence and the perimeter and throw bricks at officers. What are you going to do about it? WOLF: Absolutely. Well, I will say that we're working very, very closely with the Department of Justice, the FBI, as well as others. And I will say that we are going to have additional actions probably as early as this week. We cannot continue to let law enforcement officers targeted and injured night after night after night. And I just want to say, we often hear from, again, city leaders and even other leaders, Oregon senators, who say there is not a lot of violence going on, it is mainly peaceful protesting. I would say to you, that we have over 70 arrests. We have over 188 individual injuries. We have got over a dozen times it has been declared a riot that says otherwise. This is violent, violent activity. We have got dozens of pictures, photos, videos, some of which we released, that say the complete opposite. So, I think it is very important that Americans and your viewers understand what is going on in Portland. It is violent crime every single night. And, again, I'm asking the city, the state to step up, do their job, work with federal law enforcement, and let's bring this to a peaceful conclusion. BARTIROMO: Yes. WOLF: And let me just end by saying the department strongly supports individuals who want to peacefully protest. You want to exercise your First Amendment right, there is no concern. In fact, that happens in Portland every day. There's no incidents. There's no arrests. And we're fine. It is this violent criminal activity that has to stop. BARTIROMO: Yes. And you may actually have two of your agents permanently blind, God forbid, because they were -- they had lasers shined in their eyes. I want to take short break and come back and talk about that, as well as a protest planned right outside of your house. Stay with us. More with Secretary Chad Wolf when we come right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BARTIROMO: Welcome back. We are back live with acting Secretary of Homeland Security Chad Wolf. Secretary, we were just going through the situation in Portland. I want to get to the other major cities in our country and the violence happening there. But why can't -- before we finish on Portland, why can't you just arrest the leadership in Portland because of their ignoring what is really happening on the ground? WOLF: Well, we absolutely are doing that. So, we're working with the FBI there in Portland, with the U.S. attorney's office there in Portland, to address the leaders that are organizing this and then going after them. We're also making arrests every night. We made more than seven or eight arrests last night. And we will continue to do that. We're continuing to hold these criminals accountable. If the city won't, the federal government will hold these folks accountable. And I think it is interesting. I have often been asked by a number of city officials, as well as, again, senators, who say, just have DHS officers stay on federal property. If you stay on federal property, all will be fine. We did that Friday night, Maria, and over seven officers were injured on federal property. So, this has nothing to do with, you stay on federal property, and then we will peacefully protest. That is not the case. We know what their aim is. Their aim is to destroy that courthouse and injure law enforcement officers. We have them on video as saying that. We know what their goal is. And we're going to continue to protect and do our job. BARTIROMO: Right. How are your officers doing, your agents doing who are -- have lost eyesight because of the lasers shone at their eyes? WOLF: Yes, well, I appreciate you mentioning that. We have two to three different officers. We are waiting on final results to see how much their eyesight will permanently be lost because of the activity of these criminals. As you indicated, they are shining lasers, high, powerful lasers into officers' eyes as they emerge from the courthouse. So, we're taking steps, we have taken steps to address that. And we will continue to protect our officers at all costs. And, again, all I need is the city of Portland to step up and do their job. These individuals are on city streets. They're in city parks, arming themselves every night. And the city simply does nothing about it, absolutely nothing. BARTIROMO: Unbelievable. WOLF: It is irresponsible, and it is very dangerous. BARTIROMO: And right now, there are plans for a protest right outside of your home. What are you doing? What can you tell us about this other protest which is really trying to single-handedly attack you? WOLF: Well, what I can tell you, Maria, is, our officers in Portland every night are targeted. Their personal information is on the Internet, put out there by these criminals, by these anarchists. They're identified. Their families are harassed. They go where they're staying. The doxing is prolific. And we're trying to address that. And, of course, we see them trying to do that to myself. We will continue to do our job. We are not going to be deterred by this. This is tactic they have used for over three years, three-and-a-half years. We know what it is. We're prepared for it. At the end of the day, we're going to do our job, we're going to do our mission. The American people deserve that. And, again, I go back to the -- most reasonable Americans understand what is at play in Portland, understand what the department is doing, what the president is doing and what the administration is doing. And that is, we are standing up for law and order. And anyone who says otherwise is not being accurate. And I will say that the other -- the other side that wants to criticize law enforcement, what they don't do, they do not condemn these acts of violence in Portland. I have talked with a number of Democratic members of Congress. And all but one... BARTIROMO: Right. WOLF: Only one have asked me about the health of my officers. All they want to do is condemn law enforcement for doing their job, and, again, very irresponsible. BARTIROMO: Bernie Sanders would also like to defund the Pentagon. The Democrats want to cut defense spending as well. And, real quick, give us your sense of what is happening in other cities across the country. Shootings are up 50 percent in New York. Crime, murder, and shootings are up in Chicago. What is happening in other cities, and how are you dealing with that? Tell us about Operation LeGend. WOLF: Absolutely. So, Operation LeGend is a Department of Justice-led operation into a number of cities. It has been on going in Kansas City. It is also taking place in Chicago, Albuquerque and a few others. And, again, what we're doing is, we're surging law enforcement assets into those cities to work on federal crimes that are being committed, whether it is gang violence or drug-related violence. And these are task forces that are occurring every day. And, again, federal officers are doing that in conjunction with state and local law enforcement officers. So, what we're doing is, we're surging resources, the Department of Homeland Security, using our Homeland Security investigation agents, are supporting that effort, again, trying to address some of the violent criminal activity that is occurring out in these cities that has gotten completely out of control. But I want to emphasize, we're doing that with state and local partnership, as we have done for the past several decades. Nothing is going to change there. We are going to continue to have that partnership with them. But what we are trying to do is, we're trying to put additional assets into those cities, so that we can investigate more, we can wrap up those investigations quicker, and we can make more arrests. BARTIROMO: And is there a coincidence that many of these cities are being run by Democrat officials? I just want to talk quickly about policy and whether or not the Democrat policies are encouraging this. Nancy Pelosi the other day called your agents Storm Troopers. You have got -- just like you said a moment ago, you have got officials saying these are peaceful things, and they're not peaceful. What do you say about all of these cities, which we are going to show on camera now, being run by Democrats? WOLF: Well, I'd say the comment from Speaker Pelosi that our federal law enforcement officers, civil law enforcement officers are Storm Troopers, are the Gestapo, or are thugs is absolutely irresponsible. It's dangerous. And she should immediately apologize for that. What we again see across these cities is violent crime occurring. We will continue to surge resources, not only in Portland, but in other cities across the country. But I do want to make a different -- a distinction, which we talked about at the top of this segment. What is going on in Portland is very different than any other -- any other city across the country. And that relationship with the federal law enforcement officers and those state and local law enforcement officers is very different in Portland as it is anywhere else. So, I want to make sure that everyone is clear about that, and there's no confusion. BARTIROMO: Understood. Thank you so much, Secretary. Great to have you this morning. We so appreciate it, acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf. We will be right back with Devin Nunes live. He's got breaking news on the Russian collusion hoax, the coup that failed. You will never believe which prestigious Washington think tank he says has links to developing the dossier -- next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) \u00a0BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Congressman Devin Nunes was among the first lawmakers to question the Russian collusion hoax, as then chairman of the House Intel Committee, telling us right here on this program three years ago that the FBI engaged in a coup to take down a sitting president. This week, he joined me on \"Mornings With Maria\" over on FOX Business with some breaking news on the Steele dossier. Watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. DEVIN NUNES (R-CA): Where we now see direct links between the Brookings Institute leadership and the creation of -- possibly of the Steele dossier and the dissemination of the Steele dossier. I think they have real answer -- questions that need to be answered here about, what on earth was the president of Brookings doing texting back and forth to Steele? Why was he accepting the dossier? (END VIDEO CLIP) BARTIROMO: Joining me right now with an update is Congressman Devin Nunes. He's the ranking member the House Intel Committee. Congressman, it is always a pleasure to see you. Thank you for being here. NUNES: Thank you. BARTIROMO: We have this breaking news this morning, as the subsource of the dossier, Igor Danchenko, has been unmasked. Tell me about this subsource and its tie -- his ties to Brookings. NUNES: Well, thank you, Maria. Thanks for having me on. You may remember, a couple months ago, I was on your show, and I talked about that we were really looking at three Russians. And as Senator Graham said at the beginning of the show, it ends up that we actually weren't looking for -- the third one was actually not a Russian at all. He actually -- it sounds like he lives here in America. And the FBI led Congress to believe that -- and the media led Congress to believe and they led the American public to believe that somehow Steele had this really super secret source that nobody could know about. Well, it ends up that he used to work for the Brookings Institute. It looks like there was a lot of connections to the Brookings Institute, which, for those of your viewers who don't know what this is, this is like the prominent left-wing think tank here in our nation's capital. So, we're investigating now, and have been. And we had these links earlier on. People may remember. The president of Brookings, back in 2016, we know that he had given the dossier to a few people. We had that through testimony. You also may remember that the State Department was involved and there were additional dossiers that weren't the Steele dossiers, except that they mirrored the Steele dossiers. And we think there is a connection between the president of Brookings and those dossiers that were given to the State Department that mirrored the Steele dossiers, which, look, all of this, what does this mean? These -- this was the Clinton campaign's dossiers. It was the dirt. It was a phony story that they sold, not only to the American people, but they sold it and corrupted our FBI, where it appears like these dirty cops were more than willing to take this information and present it to the FISA court. So, here is the final point on Brookings. BARTIROMO: Are you -- yes. NUNES: So, here's the final point. So, we have now expanded our investigation, full-blown investigation, into the Brookings Institute. And it really centers on two issues. One is the IRS. This is a tax-exempt organization. They're supposed to stay out of politics. They clearly have not done that. They have obstructed our investigation with propaganda for the last four years. It's well-known that they have attacked our investigation for four years through this kind of phony legal group of fact-checkers that they set up. BARTIROMO: Right. NUNES: So, we need to look at their -- see if they have been involved in politics. BARTIROMO: OK. NUNES: Secondly, they take... BARTIROMO: So, the -- yes. NUNES: Yes. Secondly, they take -- they also take foreign money from foreign countries and foreign governments. And we need to know what foreign governments were involved in this, because were they acting on behalf of a foreign power? Everybody questioned for all this time, you know, the Trump campaign and Republicans were involved with Russians. Well, who was the Brookings Institute -- who were their foreign donors? And are they doing all of this not just to help the Democratic Party, but also any foreign government? BARTIROMO: Well, what tells me -- what this all tells me, including the subsource revealed, is that there was indeed collusion in this country, but it was collusion with Hillary Clinton and the Democrats. Is that a fair statement? (LAUGHTER) NUNES: Well, yes. And it also just goes to show you that this was some sick fantasy that was made up by the Clinton campaign and their operatives. And think of this. You had people in the media -- remember this whole thing about prostitutes and Pee tapes in Moscow? These fools were running around all over Europe and Moscow, the leading institutions, these supposedly leading reporters, but nobody calls them out on that. And the whole thing was like some sick fantasy made up by the Clinton campaign. BARTIROMO: Well, many of them actually got Pulitzer Prizes for their reporting. NUNES: That's right. BARTIROMO: I want to ask you about Robert Mueller, because these items that were declassified clearly indicate that the FBI knew that the dossier was fake, that the dossier was hearsay and bar talk. How come Mueller didn't unearth these things? I mean, let's watch Robert Mueller when he testified in front of Congress to listen to what he said about things like Fusion GPS. Roll the clip. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: When you talk about the firm that produced the Steele reporting, the name of the firm that produced that was Fusion GPS. Is that correct? ROBERT MUELLER, RUSSIA PROBE SPECIAL COUNSEL: I'm not familiar with that. (CROSSTALK) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Well, let me just help you. It was. It's not a trick question or anything. It was Fusion GPS. (END VIDEO CLIP) BARTIROMO: \"I'm not familiar with it.\" NUNES: Yes. BARTIROMO: You have unearthed all of these things, Lindsey Graham declassifying the evidence that the FBI knew the dossier was garbage, and he had no recollection? I don't understand. Where was Mueller in all of this, Congressman? NUNES: Well, look, I think the question is, is, does Mueller know where Mueller is, OK? This was somebody who has put up as an avatar to give credibility to this investigation that was phony from the beginning, OK? So I'm not talking about just in 2016. I'm talking about the day that Mueller walks in the door. I'm not sure he knows what the hell's going on. And, clearly, a couple years later, when he testifies before Congress, to not know who Fusion GPS is was astounding. And, look, the Democratic Party -- it's very odd. For a party that seems to be against white people and always talking about racism, they sure like to, like, prop up these avatar old white dudes, where -- they have one running for president right now who's hiding in his basement, who won't answer questions. What was his involvement? Their presidential candidate supposedly went after him, was the one who concocted this idea to use the Logan Act to investigate the Trump campaign, and the incoming president, by the way. BARTIROMO: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Well, you have made 14 criminal referrals, with a 15th pending. We are waiting on John Durham to investigate that. We're going to hear more from John Durham, I assume. Let me move on, real quick, about the technology CEOs testifying, not in front of your committee, but they're going to be testifying this week in the House in front of the Judiciary Committee. You have said conservative censorship is the most important issue ahead of the 2020 election. What do you want to hear from people like the head of Twitter, the head of Google, et cetera, when they testify this week? NUNES: Well, look, Congress gave these guys special powers, so that they could create companies, so that people could go and use the Internet. It was supposed to be an open public square. Think of it as a public square, where everyone, as long as they're not -- as long as they're following the law, they can go out there and state their case, and participate in that public square. What's happened here is, is that Facebook and Google and Twitter are partisan hacks for the Democratic Party and the left. And so what's happening is, think of that -- go back to that public square example. They're deciding who gets to go into the public square. So, the good thing will be is that we're actually going to have the Parler CEO who's going to testify. And you can follow me at Parler @DevinNunes at Parler. BARTIROMO: Yes. NUNES: And he's been on your show, Maria. They have actually -- they're actually... BARTIROMO: Yes. NUNES: They have that town square. And they're letting all Americans go there and express their views. BARTIROMO: OK. We got to jump. Congressman, it's good to see you. Thank you so much, Devin Nunes. NUNES: My pleasure. BARTIROMO: We will be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) \u00a0BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo this week taking a hard line once again on Beijing, accusing the Chinese Communist Party of tyrannizing its people, while speaking at a Richard Nixon Library event in California on Thursday, Pompeo's rebuke coming just hours after two Chinese diplomats were caught trying to steal coronavirus vaccine research in Houston. Joining me right now is Ray Dalio. He's the co-chief investment officer and the co-investment officer of Bridgewater Associates and founder. It is great to see you once again, Ray. Thanks very much for joining me once again this week. RAY DALIO, CO-CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER/CO-CHAIRMAN, BRIDGEWATER ASSOCIATES: \u00a0Great to be here.\u00a0 \u00a0BARTIROMO: So, I want to talk about the economy and your thoughts on the dollar and all of the stimulus that we have seen in the Federal Reserve, Ray. But, first, I have got to get your reaction to all that we're seeing coming out of China. I know that you are a global investor. And you look for growth across the world. Would you still want to invest in China, given what we have learned about the Communist Party? DALIO: I think there are three things, three big things going on, and they operate together. And those are the important ones. The first is where we are in the debt cycle, the printing of money, and that. The second is how we are with each other, that we're having an ideological civil war that, when you combine that with an economic downturn, in which there is the printing of money and the creation of money out of thin air, is an issue. And then you have the rising power of China challenging the existing power. Those three things, the last time they happened was in the 1930-to-'45 period. I think you have to see them together. So, that is the position we're now in. In terms of China, we will -- we are in a conflict with China. You can call it a war, like the 1930s, so that there is a -- there is a trade war, there is a technology war, there is a geopolitical war, and there could be a capital war. And so that's the reality. Now regarding policy, that's for governments to set. But the challenge is to set it well, because, if you say, by law, don't invest in China, or even possibly withholding the payment of bonds that the United States owes payment on in China, these things are possibilities, and they have big implications, such as for the value of the dollar, because investors, free market investors, are not used to having those things dictated by the government. So, these are difficult questions that have to be well-addressed at this time. BARTIROMO: But would the -- would the news of one million Uyghurs being locked up in reeducation camps, the ignoring of the rule of law by stealing intellectual property, the overreach in Hong Kong, breaking promises there, militarizing the South China Sea, do any of these things come into focus when deciding to invest in China? DALIO: I think that we, as Americans, have got to decide on what's most important to us. And it becomes a challenge. For example, from the Chinese perspective, they believe that is an area of sovereignty and that those internal issues are be to dealt with by them, and we have to have -- just like they wouldn't deal in our internal issues. These are questions that individuals don't decide. Individuals have to decide... BARTIROMO: OK. DALIO: ... if they're ethical, if they're operating in ways that are consistent with their beliefs. That is a personal decision that you want to do. BARTIROMO: That is exactly right. DALIO: But the only -- but, at the end of the day... BARTIROMO: That's what I'm saying, yes. DALIO: At the end of the day, it will... BARTIROMO: Hold on, Ray. We're going to take -- we're going to -- yes. DALIO: At the end of the day... (CROSSTALK) BARTIROMO: We're going to take a break and then come back to that when we come right back. Stay with us, Ray Dalio. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BARTIROMO: We are back with Bridgewater chief investment officer Ray Dalio. And, Ray, a moment ago, you mentioned the potential for a capital war. I want to ask you about the economy and what your thoughts are about all of the stimulus being thrown at the economy, given this shutdown. Do you worry about the impact to the reserve currency, the dollar, Ray? DALIO: Yes, I -- we are only going to be successful if we do things in a solid way, right? So, the things I worry about the most are the soundness of our money. You can't continue to run deficits, sell debt, or print money, rather than be productive and sustain that over a period of time. And that relates to the money and what's now happening. And the second is the working together. I study history. And, as I say, the '30-to-'45 period is educational, because, within each country, there have been conflicts about -- like our conflicts. Four democracies chose to be dictatorships because of the disorder of how people are fighting with each other, rather than working together. If we don't work together to do the sound things, to be productive, to earn more than we spend, to build our currency, the stability of our currency, and build a good balance sheet, we are going to decline. We are declining because of those things. And so it's basically in those fundamentals that are the most important things that we deal with. We are our own worst enemy. BARTIROMO: Yes. DALIO: So, how we deal with each other soundly and productively, in a way... BARTIROMO: Yes. DALIO: ... that most people in the country believe is fair, is going to determine our future. BARTIROMO: Ray -- Ray, thank you.

They're made for each other. Thanks, Greg. The United States Supreme Court hands the Trump administration two major victories. President Trump claims a huge drop in mortality from the coronavirus, but Dr. Anthony Fauci says wait just a minute. And why some on the left are concerned about how Joe Biden might do in the presidential debates. This is SPECIAL REPORT. Good evening and welcome to Washington. I'm John Roberts in for Bret Baier tonight. Tonight, the president is celebrating two major victories in the United States Supreme Court. The first allows more employers to opt out of providing no cost birth control over religious and moral objections. The other, sides with two catholic schools that certain employees cannot sue for employment discrimination. Fox news chief legal correspondent and anchor of \"FOX NEWS @ NIGHT\" Shannon Bream is here now with the details. Good evening, Shannon. SHANNON BREAM, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST: Hello, John. Well, you're right. A pair of decisions today that were big wins for the Trump administration. They're tied to religious liberty, those issues as we now tonight await a pair of additional decisions that could impact enormously this year's presidential election. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BREAM: It's taken seven years and two trips to the Supreme Court, but today the Little Sisters of the Poor finally got what they've been fighting for. An exception to the Affordable Care Act regulation that would have forced them to provide cost free contraceptives to their employees in direct conflict with the tenets of their faith. Their specific mission, caring for the elderly poor in their final days. SISTER CONSTANCE VEIT, LITTLE SISTERS OF THE POOR: It's unthinkable for us on the one hand to be holding the hand of the dying elderly and on the other hand to possibly be facilitating the taking of innocent unborn life. BREAM: In 2017, the Trump administration issued new rules providing the nuns with an exception, the state of Pennsylvania and later New Jersey sued. Today the court found the administration got it right. Justice Thomas writing for the majority, quote, the federal government has arrived at a solution that exempts the Little Sisters from the source of their complicity-based concerns. The administratively imposed contraceptive mandate. Justice Ginsburg dissented, writing, for the first time, the court cast totally aside countervailing rights and interests in its zeal to secure religious rights to the nth degree. In another seven, two opinion today, the justices ruled in favor of two catholic schools facing employee discrimination suits, finding that the two teachers fell within the ministerial exemptions to such lawsuits. Meaning they perform the vital religious duties such as educating their students in the catholic faith. In recent weeks, Chief Justice John Roberts has been in the spotlight as a key swing vote in a number of critical cases. But just last night, a revelation. That he was injured in a fall June 21st and taken to the hospital where he was stitched up and kept overnight. Robert suffered a seizure in 2007 and reportedly a similar incident in 1993 but this time around, doctors ruled out that possibility and say the fall was likely related to dehydration. Each justice decides for him or herself whether or not medical information is publicly released. (END VIDEOTAPE) BREAM: So, it's official, tomorrow will be the final round of opinions for this term that include two cases aimed at getting access to the president's financial records and tax returns. Three House committees all controlled by Democrats and the New York state prosecutor have sued to get their hands on them. 10:00 a.m. Eastern tomorrow, John, we will have our answer from the justices. ROBERTS: Those are going to be some big cases and we're glad that the chief justice is feeling OK after the fall. Shannon Bream for us tonight. We'll see you later on this evening. Shannon, thanks. President Trump says mortality from coronavirus is down tenfold. One of his top medical advisors though calls the death rate a false narrative. This comes as infections in the United States surpassed the three million mark. Still, the president is pushing hard for schools to reopen in just a few weeks. Correspondent Kristin Fisher is at the White House tonight where the president welcomed his counterpart from south of the border. And we are expecting to hear live from both of the leaders from the White House later on in this hour. Good evening, Kristin. KRISTIN FISHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Good evening, John. Well, this was President Lopez Obrador's first foreign trip as president. His first time meeting President Trump in person and he flew here commercially, which is very unusual for a head of state and he was invited here by President Trump to celebrate the new North American trade agreement, the USMCA, which took effect exactly one week ago today. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: It's the largest, fairest and most advanced trade deal ever reached by any country. FISHER: President Trump standing with the president of Mexico and celebrating the fulfillment of a campaign promise from 2016 while also looking ahead to the fall of 2020. TRUMP: We want the schools to be open then going in the fall and most of them I think are looking at it that way, it's very important. FISHER: For the second day in a row, an administration wide push to get schools reopen this fall. And if they don't, President Trump is threatening to cut off funding. MIKE PENCE, VICE PRESIDENTS OF THE UNITED STATES: We're going to be looking for ways to give states a strong incentive and encouragement to get kids back to school. FISHER: New York Governor Andrew Cuomo says, if safe, he too wants schools open in the fall but that the decision is up to him, not the president. GOV. ANDREW CUOMO (D-NY): He wants the schools reopened. It's not up to him. It's not up to him. It's not his legal authority, just like it was in his legal authority to say he's going to decide when the economy reopens. FISHER: President Trump is also pushing the CDC to change its guidelines for safely reopening schools, guidelines the president calls expensive and impractical. At today's Task Force briefing which was held at the Department of Education, the Vice President announced that the CDC will now be putting out new guidelines next week. And the head of the CDC said that the agencies guidance should not be used to justify keeping schools closed. ROBERT REDFIELD, DIRECTOR, CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION: That was not the intent of CDC's guidelines. It's to be used as a rationale to keep schools closed. FISHER: As schools struggle with reopening in an era of social distancing and at a time when health experts are warning of a second wave this fall, President Trump is continuing to tell that the viruses mortality rate is among the lowest of any country, something task force member Dr. Anthony Fauci calls a quote, false narrative. DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH: There's so many other things that are very dangerous and bad about this virus. Don't get yourself into false complacency. (END VIDEOTAPE) FISHER: Now, noticeably absent from today's meetings at the White House was the Prime Minister of Canada, Justin Trudeau, the third signatory on the trade agreement. Trudeau says that he was not able to make it due to some scheduling conflicts and concerns about the coronavirus. But President Trump said in the Rose Garden that he will be hosting Trudeau here at the White House on another day at a more appropriate time, John. ROBERTS: Kristin Fisher for us tonight at the White House. And again, we expect to hear from President Trump and the Mexican president in about 6:35 Eastern Time that has been scheduled for -- things tend to run though as Kristin knows, just a little late at the White House from time to time. Thanks, Kristin. FISHER: You got it. ROBERTS: Health officials in Texas report more than 10,000 new confirmed coronavirus cases in the Lone Star State on Tuesday, that is a record. Moments ago, the state announced a daily death count of 2,813. That increase of 98 is a new single day record. Also today, Houston's Democratic mayor canceled the state Republican convention. That announcement coming as the president's point man in the virus fight says the recent increases in some places are beginning to level off. Correspondent Casey Stegall has the latest for us tonight from Dallas. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) CASEY STEGALL, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT: After weeks of increasing case numbers across parts of the Sun Belt, today a glimmer of hope from the White House Coronavirus Task Force. PENCE: We are actually seeing early indications of a percent of positive testing flattening in Arizona and Florida and Texas. STEGALL: Hospitalization rates however are a different story. DR. JOSEPH VARON, UNITED MEMORIAL MEDICAL CENTER: We have seen an exponential increase in the number of cases that we've had of COVID. STEGALL: A 515 percent jump to be exact across all Texas hospitals since Memorial Day. Health data shows more than 2,600 patients are currently in the ICU, a 305 percent hike since the end of May. Forcing some providers to get creative, though they warn space is running out. VARON: We are playing musical chairs in the middle of the night, moving one patient from one side to another. STEGALL: In Florida, more than 55 hospitals around the state reported their ICU beds are already full. Another 33 telling Fox they've got less than 10 percent capacity remaining. Today the vice president said additional help is on the way. More than a thousand doctors and nurses and medical personnel are being deployed to assist in the hardest hit areas. The federal government has also opened new surge testing facilities in Edinburg, Texas; Baton Rouge, Louisiana and Jacksonville, Florida. They're free and open to the public. HHS says, with the primary goal of identifying asymptomatic patients to help lower further community spread. ADM BRETT GIROIR, ASSISTANT SECRETARY, DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES: We already have almost 6,500 appointments already made this morning, so that going very, very well. (END VIDEOTAPE) STEGALL: And more college sports cancellations are coming in tonight among division one schools. The Ivy League, whose eight members include Yale, Princeton and Harvard now announcing that they will cancel the athletic events for not just the fall but also winter over these virus concerns, John. ROBERTS: Casey Stegall for us tonight. Casey, thanks so much. Los Angeles County supervisors are considering a plan to close the Men's Central Jail within a year. Last year, supervisors rejected a proposal to replace the facility. Today, Supervisor Hilda Solis said the coronavirus pandemic presents a magnified and reaffirmed need to close the jail altogether. An army officer who was a key witness in President Trump's impeachment trial is retiring. The lawyer for Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Vindman says his client has determined his career, quote, will forever be limited because of retaliation by the president and his allies. President Trump fired Vindman as the National Security Council's top expert on Ukraine back in February. A senior defense official confirms to Fox the Defense Secretary Esper signed off on Vindman's promotion to full bird colonel on Monday. Vindman though will retire at the lower rank. Stocks are up today, the Dow gained 177. The S&P 500 finished ahead 25. The NASDAQ jumped 149 points. Two major universities are suing the Trump administration over the enforcement of a rule that could adversely affect foreign students who are studying in this country. National Correspondent William La Jeunesse takes a look tonight from Los Angeles. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NEHA JAIN, NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY: I just feel there's a complete lack of empathy. WILLIAM LA JEUNESSE, FOX NEWS CHANNEL NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Just weeks before classes begin, President Trump has foreign students and U.S. universities scrambling to save their school year. CHRISTINA LUTHER, DIRECTOR OF INTERNATIONAL STUDENT SCHOLAR SERVICES, PORTLAND STATE UNIVERSITY: My heart is really going out to the international students in the country. I think that this is sending a very strong message that we don't want to have them here. LA JEUNESSE: A million foreign students attend U.S. universities. After granting exemptions for spring and summer, ICE will now enforce a mandate that requires them to attend in person classes even if their colleges go entirely online. TERRY HARTLE, SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT, AMERICAN COUNCIL ON EDUCATION: If you make a decision to open online because it's the best way to keep your campus community safe, keep in mind that you're also making a decision to send all of your international students' home. LA JEUNESSE: The ICE rule's been on the books because of fraud. Many foreign nationals who couldn't enter the U.S. legally got student visas from online colleges, then worked under the table. VITAL D'CARPIO, IMMIGRATION ATTORNEY: In this case, they are talking about people who are right here legally, who had to wait to get a visa. LA JEUNESSE: This morning, Harvard and MIT sued the administration calling the rules impossible, expensive, and dangerous to send students home or force them into class during a pandemic. GOV. JAY INSLEE (D-WA): This is a typically xenophobic and reckless act by the administration. LA JEUNESSE: Some Berkeley students hope to skirt the rule by holding a one hour in person class taught by students. ICE said that won't cut it. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We're not sure if we should go back to home country or stay here. (END VIDEOTAPE) LA JEUNESSE: For universities, this is a big deal, $40 billion infusion of foreign cash. It's now up to a federal judge in Boston to approve this restraining order or not, John. ROBERTS: William La Jeunesse reporting for us tonight from Los Angeles. William, thank you. One of the now former Minneapolis police officers accused in the death of George Floyd is asking to have charges against him dropped. An attorney for Thomas Lane says the case against his client should be dismissed for lack of probable cause. Attorney Earl Gray says Lane asked twice if the officers should turn Floyd on his side. The officer who used his knee to pin Floyd's neck to the ground said no. Lane is charged with aiding and abetting second-degree murder and manslaughter. There are new calls tonight for New York Mayor Bill de Blasio to resign over the epidemic of violence in his city and his support of drastically defunding police. Law enforcement reform is a major issue in several big cities. Correspondent Aishah Hasnie shows us tonight. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) AISHAH HASNIE, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT: As calls to defund and dismantle the police spread across the country, Philadelphia's chapter for Black Lives Matter announces it has a five-year plan to do just that. YAHNE NDGO, ORGANIZER, BLACK LIVES MATTER PHILADELPHIA: We don't want to see any police in our community. Five years gives time for the community to begin to build what is needed instead of police. HASNIE: The chapter president also thinking federal changes to the president's authority to send the National Guard in to any state with or without an invitation. NDGO: That creates a lot of danger or harm. HASNIE: This as crime skyrockets in the nation's largest cities. In New York, a father gunned down in broad daylight holding his 6-year-old daughter's hand. Gun violence was up 130 percent in June compared to last June. Numbers police say they haven't seen in a quarter of a century. BILL DE BLASIO, MAYOR OF NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK: We're dealing with unprecedented reality. HASNIE: Mayor Bill de Blasio, blames coronavirus. Former New York City police commissioner Ray Kelly feels differently. RAY KELLY, FORMER COMMISSIONER, NEW YORK POLICE DEPARTMENT: I lay the problems in New York City solely at the feet of Bill de Blasio. He has eviscerated the police department. One of the most important and significant things he did was to eliminate the anti-crime units. Retirements are at record levels, and the future is quite frankly very bleak. HASNIE: New York Congressman Lee Zeldin, now calling on the mayor to step down. REP. LEE ZELDIN (R-NY): I really believe he has to be removed and the city won't survive him staying in for the remainder of his term. (END VIDEOTAPE) HASNIE: Mayor de Blasio's term ends at the end of 2021. If he were to resign, then, the city's public advocate, Jumaane Williams will be next in line to take over. Although he wants to see even more cuts made to police. A New York City mayor hasn't resigned since 1932. And we have yet to hear a comment about this from Mayor de Blasio himself. John? ROBERTS: Aishah Hasnie in New York City tonight. Aishah, thanks. Up next, President Trump's continued efforts to get rid of Obamacare. Will they help him or hurt him in November? First, here is what some of our Fox affiliates around the country are covering tonight. Fox 57 in Columbia, a South Carolina Republican Senator Tim Scott, hosts Attorney General William Barr for discussions with law enforcement and religious leaders. Barr, says all parties need to avoid extremes, make improvements, and strike a balance. Fox 32 in Chicago, as United Airline, says it will send layoff warnings to 36,000 employees, nearly half its U.S. staff because of losses from coronavirus. United officials say they still hope to limit the number of layoffs by offering early retirement. And this is a live look at Milwaukee from Fox 6, one of the big stories there tonight. The postponement of this year's Ryder Cup golf event scheduled to be played at Whistling Straits in Wisconsin. The international competition will take place next fall at the same venue. Officials say they based the decision on guidance from the CDC and other institutions. That's tonight's live look \"OUTSIDE THE BELTWAY\" from SPECIAL REPORT. We will be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) ROBERTS: Harry Potter creator, J.K. Rowling is among 150 prominent writers, academics, and activists who were sounding off about the growing cancel culture. Rowling and fellow authors, Margaret Atwood, Noam Chomsky, and Salman Rushdie are among the signatories of a letter that will be published in Harper's Magazine, cautioning against what they term is a new set of moral attitudes and political commitments that are weakening open debate and tolerance. The letter says, \"The way to defeat bad ideas is by exposure, argument, and persuasion, not by trying to silence or wish them away. We refuse any false choice between justice and freedom, which cannot exist without each other.\" One of the big issues in November as we deal with the coronavirus pandemic will be health care. The Trump administration continues its efforts to get rid of Obamacare, and that will be a rallying point for Democrats who want to stop him. Tonight, correspondent Mark Meredith looks at where the battle lines are being drawn. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: It's a law that saves lives. MARK MEREDITH, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Democrats campaign on health care almost every election. And this year, the issue may matter more than ever. LESLIE DACH, CHAIR, PROTECT OUR CARE: Health care is still the number one kitchen table issue in America. But people now see it through the eyes of the pandemic. MEREDITH: Leslie Dach with Protect Our Care has fought for years to prevent Obamacare from being dismantled. Now, he's on guard as the Supreme Court could declare the program invalid after Congress repealed the individual mandate, the law imposing a tax for not having coverage. DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: That was a big deal. That was one of the most unpopular things anywhere or on any subject. MEREDITH: President Trump, says he hopes the court strikes down Obamacare once and for all, leaving Democrats outraged. REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA): It was wrong any time, now it's beyond stupid. Beyond stupid. MEREDITH: The Trump administration says it will unveil a new health care plan if and when Obamacare is killed off by the court. Critics say they're bluffing. DACH: Well, it's hard to keep a straight face on that. MEREDITH: Meantime, Medicaid is growing. Voters in traditionally conservative Oklahoma recently approved a ballot initiative to expand health care coverage for low-income residents. Jonathan Schleifer led the effort for The Fairness Project. JONATHAN SCHLEIFER, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, THE FAIRNESS PROJECT: The Americans want to provide more health care and not less. We understand what's at stake. I mean, frankly, the debate around the ACA has actually heightened everyone's awareness as to how important providing health care is. MEREDITH: Schleifer thinks the pandemic as people rethinking their views on government health care options, as many Americans may fear their jobs and health benefits could vanish at any time. (END VIDEOTAPE) MEREDITH: Next month, voters in Missouri will decide whether or not to expand Medicaid, even though Missouri is one of 18 states suing to have Obamacare abolished. In Washington, Mark Meredith, Fox News. ROBERTS: All right, coming up next, why some on the left are increasingly worried about how Joe Biden might perform against President Trump in the debates. First, \"BEYOND OUR BORDERS\" tonight, Serbian police, say 23 people had been detained, and scores of police officers and demonstrators injured in clashes that erupted over the return of lockdown measures against the coronavirus. Yesterday, Serbia reported its highest single-day death toll of 13 amid 299 new COVID-19 cases. Actor Johnny Depp denies hitting ex-wife Amber Heard during cross- examination by a lawyer for the British tabloid, The Sun. The newspaper is defending a libel claim after calling Depp, a wife beater. Depp says Heard's claims are untrue. North Koreans marked the 26th anniversary of the death of the country's founder, Kim Il-sung. Video on state T.V. shows North Korean people placing flowers and paying tribute at statues of Kim Il-sung and his son, Kim Jong- il in Pyongyang. Kim Il-sung led his country from its founding in 1948 until he died in 1994. Just some of the other stories \"BEYOND OUR BORDERS\" tonight. We will be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) ROBERTS: Former Trump advisor, Roger Stone, tells Fox News, his Facebook accounts have been restricted and taken down. Facebook's top security policy officer confirms that Stones accounts were among 54 Facebook accounts, 50 Facebook pages, and four Instagram accounts that were closed today for policy violation. In tonight's \"DEMOCRACY 2020\" report, growing concerns from the left about how Joe Biden might do against President Trump in debates. These concerns mount as a new player in the political field enters the presidential picture. Correspondent Peter Doocy has tonight's wrap up. PETER DOOCY, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT: Today, Joe Biden took aim at Trump from afar. BIDEN: Look what's going on internationally, look what's going on at home. It's always about him. DOOCY: He'll have three chances to say that to Trump's face this fall, with socially distanced debates ahead. The Biden campaign has committed to three, but one liberal opinion writer urges Joe not to go unless the president agrees to release recent tax returns and real-time fact-checking. New York Times columnist Tom Friedman, writes, \"Trump might very well lie and mislead for the entire debate, forcing Biden to have to spend a majority of his time correcting Trump before making his own points. That is not a good way for Biden to reintroduce himself to the American people. And let's not kid ourselves, these debates will be his reintroduction to most Americans, who have neither seen nor heard from him for months if not years.\" Voters are just now being introduced to Kanye West the candidate. The rapper tells \"Forbes\" the idea to run came to him in the shower, and he hired Elon Musk as an advisor, but hasn't filed any paperwork or hired any staffers. West tells \"Forbes\" he's done supporting Trump and finds Biden flawed, too. Quote, \"A lot of times, just like political parties, they feel all blacks have to be Democrat. This man, Joe Biden, said if you don't vote for me, then you are not black.\" It's unclear how West would fare, so for now Biden is continuing voter outreach as best he can. JOE BIDEN, (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: The phrase, everybody's been woked. Guess what. The rest of the working-class people in America have been awakened. (END VIDEOTAPE) DOOCY: It's another sign of how unique this cycle is. The 77-year-old Biden is using terms like \"woke\" while the 43-year-old Kanye West is pledging to make his campaign theme \"Happy Birthday,\" which would make him the only candidate with a song everybody already knows. John? JOHN ROBERTS, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: And many people do their best thinking in the showers. Peter Doocy for us tonight. Peter, thank you. Some Democrat moderates in Congress are looking over their shoulders tonight, anxious about the prospects of hanging onto their jobs after the November election. Our Senior political correspondent Mike Emanuel tells us that is because the party as a whole is moving to the left. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MIKE EMANUEL, FOX NEWS CHIEF CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: The road to a Republican majority in the House runs through some moderate districts in New Jersey held by freshman Democrats. Josh Gottheimer, Tom Malinowski, Mikie Sherrill, and Andy Kim are all expected to face very competitive races in November. REP. ANDY KIM, (D-NJ): What I keep hearing from people is they just want to be able to move past this hyper-partisanship, find areas of common ground, and build on that? EMANUEL: Tom Kean Jr., son of the former New Jersey governor with the same name, is taking on Malinowski. TOM KEAN, (R-NJ) U.S. CONGRESSIONAL CANDIDATE: Since going down to Washington D.C. he has voted with Nancy Pelosi 97 percent of the time. And when you vote with Nancy Pelosi 97 percent of the time, it means you're voting against your own constituents. EMANUEL: One challenge for the moderates is having to defend controversial comments from members of the so-called squad. REP. ILHAN OMAR, (D-MN): We are fighting to tear down systems of oppression that exist in housing, in education, in health care, in employment, in the air we breathe. EMANUEL: Jeff Van Drew was a freshman Democrat who changed parties and fully embraced President Trump. Van Drew is foreshadowing how Republicans will link moderates to the left. Quote, \"While the Democrats were tripping over each other to appease the radical left in a bitter and divisive primary, our Republican Party came together and is united as we head into the general election.\" Van Drew faces Amy Kennedy in November, an educator and daughter-in-law of the late Senator Ted Kennedy. (END VIDEOTAPE) EMANUEL: Expect Republicans to go after the New Jersey freshman Democrats, noting they ran as moderates but have been in line with Pelosi and the progressives on major agenda issues. John? ROBERTS: Mike Emanuel for tonight. Mike, thanks. The push from many directions to get your kids back in school classrooms this fall. We will get reaction from the panel when we come back. And a live shot of the Cross Hall in the White House as we await President Trump and AMLO, the president of Mexico, who will be making statements coming up in the next few minutes. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) ROBERTS: Live pictures from the Cross Hall at the White House where we are expecting President Trump and the Mexican president any moment now. You can see that Vice President Pence has taken his seat, which means that we are probably just a couple minutes away from this. But first -- (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, (R) PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We want the schools to be open and going in the fall, and most of them I think are looking at it that way. MIKE PENCE, U.S. VICE PRESIDENT: For children that have mental health issues, for special needs children, for nutrition, for children in communities facing persistent poverty, the school is the place where they receive all those services. LILY ESKELSEN GARCIA, NATIONAL EDUCATION ASSOCIATION: I double dog dare Donald Trump do sit in a class of 39 sixth-graders and breathe that air without any preparation for how we are going to bring our kids back safely. (END VIDEO CLIP) ROBERTS: A real political tug-of-war in the nation between a president and parents who want children to go back to school, and other lawmakers and parents who say it's too soon. Let's bring in our panel tonight, Jonathan Swan, national political reporter for \"Axios\" is with us, as is Kimberley Strassel, a member of the editorial board at \"The Wall Street Journal.\" And we are waiting for Steve Hayes, editor of \"The Dispatch,\" to join us. We will let you know when he does. Kimberley, let's start with you. The president saying this morning in a tweet that he disagrees with the CDC \"on their very tough and expensive guidelines for opening schools. While they want them, they are asking schools to do very impractical things. I will be meeting with them.\" Among the impractical things the president talks about, reconfiguring classrooms for six foot separate, closing communal use shared spaces, creating one-way routes in hallways, and upgrading ventilation systems. It's interesting that the president is at odds, Kimberley, with his own Centers for Disease Control which say they are going to come out with new guidelines next week. KIMBERLEY STRASSEL, WALL STREET JOURNAL: One of the problems with the CDC all throughout this pandemic is it hasn't been clear about where or why it comes up with the recommendations it makes, and then it changes them. And one of the problems with these is you can look at real-world examples already of where schools are open, and they are not necessarily taking this guidance or following that. Look at the Netherlands. They've had their schools open since May and without social distancing, and it's been working. ROBERTS: And we need to go quickly to the White House. Just hang in there. We'll be right back with you. DONALD TRUMP, (R) PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: -- working for a little while longer, but it's an honor to have you in the White House. Tonight's gathering follows a productive day of meetings and concludes an exceptional visit in which we made tremendous strides on behalf of our countries. To your great president, I would just like to say that it's been a profound privilege to have you with us today, and it's a profound privilege to have you as my friend. We've had a great relationship right from the beginning. And I think that maybe it was against all odds. (LAUGHTER) TRUMP: A lot of people were betting against it. But they've learned not to bet against us, I suspect. I know they've learned that in Mexico. The people of Mexico and the United States are joined together by shared values, shared faith, and shared future on this beautiful continent. We are both proud, sovereign nations built over generations by the sweat, sacrifice, and devotion of hardworking people who love their country and who give everything they have to create a better life for their beautiful children. In the United States, the extraordinary contributions of Mexican-Americans are felt in every industry, every community, and every facet of our nation. From art to commerce to science to medicine, the Mexican people are incredible. They upheld our highest values -- God, family, and country. They launched small businesses, propel industries, and serve heroically in police departments and in our great military. As we gather tonight, we reflect on all that are two people have accomplished together over the span of many generations, and we embrace the incredible opportunities that lay ahead. We're each blessed with a vast land that touches both the world's great oceans, extraordinary natural resources, and above all, we are blessed with some of the most spirited, adventurous, determined, and talented people on the face of the earth. It's all about the people. Mr. President, I'm certain that together we can unlock a future of even greater potential for our children, prosperity for our people, safety for our citizens, and pride for our countries. With today's visit, I've never been more confident that the future of this precious relationship and the destiny of this majestic continent will never be in better hands and never had a better future. Once again, I want to thank you and all of your representatives for being here today. It's a great honor. It's a great honor to be with you. Thank you very much. I'd now like to invite President Lopez Obrador to say a few words on behalf of the incredible people of Mexico. Thank you. (APPLAUSE) ROBERTS: President Trump there in the Cross Hall of the White House with Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, the president of Mexico. They are not expected to take questions, but we will monitor it in the event that they do. Jonathan Swan, you saw the two presidents earlier today in the Rose Garden and again there in the Cross Hall. This is the second world leader to come visit the White House since the coronavirus crisis hit, and AMLO's first venture outside the country. clearly the relationship between Mexico and the United States is an important one. They signed the new USMCA agreement this afternoon. Your thoughts as we watch the president there today with President Obrador. Politically, it's helpful to President Trump. It gives him a chance to talk about one of the signature accomplishments of this three-and-a-half years in office, that is rewriting NAFTA, coming up with the U.S.-Mexico-Canada agreement. And there's also fond memories from the 2016 campaign trail where the president traveled to Mexico, had that surprise appearance there, and when I talk to people who were on that campaign, it was one of those moments that they saw as a turning point in the campaign and gave him a real gust of momentum as he came back to America. So I think there are echoes of that now where he's in a tough spot in 2020 and looking for something to reignite his election campaign. ROBERTS: So the two leaders will continue to talk there in the Cross Hall again. If they take questions, we will come back to them. We do want to come back to the panel, though, because we have got a lot of news on whether or not children should go back to school in the fall and a couple big Supreme Court rulings. So stay with us on SPECIAL REPORT. We'll be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) ROBERTS: And we continue to monitor what's going on at the White House right as President Trump and the president of Mexico both making statements. They are not expected to take any questions, so we are going back to our panel just now. And there you can see the two presidents finishing, and I believe that they are probably pretty much done. Sorry, I'm just waiting to see what President Trump said. Yes, and they are finished. So let's get back to what we were talking about before, which is whether or not kids are going to go back to school this fall. The president, as we pointed out a few minutes ago, very critical of the Centers for Disease Control over guidelines he says are onerous and expensive. But both the director of the Centers for Disease Control and the Vice President Mike Pence today, wait a minute, CDC guidelines are not meant to keep students out of school this fall. Let's listen to this exchange. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DR. ROBERT REDFIELD, DIRECTOR, CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION: \u00a0The purpose of CDC's guidance is, remember, it's guidance. It's not requirements. And its purpose is to facilitate the reopening and the keeping open the schools in this country. MIKE PENCE, U.S. VICE PRESIDENT: We want to make it very clear that the guidance we are issuing is not to supplant the laws, the rules, the regulations, or the decisions at the state level. It's meant to create essentially a range of options. (END VIDEO CLIP) ROBERTS: Now, one of the things that has happened since we last left you with the panel is we have found Steve Hayes. And Steve, why don't you weigh in on this. What the vice president and the Centers for Disease Control director said was after the president tweeted. Is there some sense here that the president looks like he is strong-arming the CDC on this point? STEVE HAYES, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Sure. I think that seems plain on its face. And I think the CDC guidance was issued for a reason. And whether or not the effects are to lead to the closing of schools or the continued closing of schools should be irrelevant. What should matter here are the public health implications. I think what we are watching happen in real time is what should be a public health matter be pulled further and further into the political and culture wars taking place in this country. And there are all sorts of reasons for that, but this has not been the kind of process that you want to see where you had public health officials providing their very best guidance, elected leaders taking that guidance and then forming decisions and determining the next steps from there. I think this is yet another example of the kind of whipsawing of the state and localities as they try to figure out -- they have been working off the CDC guidelines as they've been trying to figure out what comes next. And now there is sort of a new wrinkle thrown in, not because necessarily of any new public health findings. But I think, and it appears inescapably because of politics. ROBERTS: And as we mentioned before we managed to hook up with Stephen, the vice president said that the CDC will come out with new guidelines next week. President Trump tweeting this morning that other people are doing it, why not us. He tweeted, quote, \"In Germany, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, and many other countries, schools are open with no problems. The Dems think it would be bad for them politically if U.S. schools open before the November election, but is important for the children and families. May cut off funding if not open!\" Kimberley, the president suggesting he has got a lever there to try to force schools into reopening, but does he really? STRASSEL: I don't think he really does have a lever, because we've had a lot of different disagreements at that level about when the president has the ability to unilaterally cut off money to the states if they don't comply. We had that with sanctuary cities. But he does make an excellent point. I agree with Steve. We don't want this pulled into the political realm. But at the same time there's a lot of reason to ask a question the CDC guidance that was there, and reason not to believe that it's the public health -- the right way to go. As the president pointed out, look at the Netherlands. The Netherlands has had schools open since May. And not only that, they have their own recommendations is that you don't even need social distancing for children under the age of 17. And their schools have been proceeding great and they haven't had any spikes or problems with the virus there. So we have real- world evidence that you can do and do this safely. ROBERTS: One of the other big stories of the day was the Supreme Court decision, the seven to two decision today, that religious organizations like the Little Sisters of the Poor do not have to provide free contraceptive services under the ACA for people who are working for them. Jonathan Swan, this has been called a big win for the Little Sisters, but it's also a big win, I would think, for the Trump administration who set the policy for this to happen. SWAN: Yes, it is, for sure. The writing was on the wall on this one for a while. And it also forms a pattern. When it comes to -- there's been a lot of criticism, conservative criticism of Chief Justice John Roberts for some of his rulings, but when it comes to matters of religious expression and religious freedom, that does tend to carry the day in the Roberts court. You've seen that in a number of decisions. There was the ruling about the Muslim inmates and growing a beard. You've seen it with this ruling today. Last week they said states that subsidize private schools cannot exclude religious schools. So if you're somebody who is supportive of religious freedom and you support the president, this was a really good week. ROBERTS: Stephen, the big opinion that we are expecting to come down tomorrow will be over whether or not President Trump has to release his tax returns. Should the court rule against the president? What's the follow? HAYES: Just when we need things to be amped up even further, right, we have that decision, the potential of some Supreme Court retirements. I think we are short of getting started here. Let me amplify what Jonathan said. This is a really under-covered story, I think. There's been a tremendous winning streak for religious liberty at the Supreme Court. It hasn't been covered. There have been some cases where it's been two steps forward, one step back. But this has been one heck of a streak, and I think it's one of the things that will likely determine the legacy of the Roberts' court. ROBERTS: Thanks all for joining us today, and sorry for the interruption earlier, but sometimes breaking news gets in the way. And when we come back, some good news to share with you. ROBERTS: And finally tonight on SPECIAL REPORT, making new friends. At least once a week during lockdown, eight-year-old Tallulah would see her neighborhood delivery driver, Tim Joseph, who is deaf. The young girl from Manchester, England, drew Tim a rainbow picture saying thank you, but she wanted to communicate further and decided to learn some sign language. In the touching video that you can see here, Tallulah greets Tim with a smile and signs to him \"have a good day.\" And thank you for watching SPECIAL REPORT. I'm John Roberts in Washington.

And tonight, we lead with this story. The perfect storm started as the virus broke out in pockets of America this winter. Then we had the unprecedented lockdown that was put in place. There were concerns that the massive resulting unemployment could lead to unrest and instability and uprisings. That was hard to believe or imagine at that point.But now we've seen it as racial tensions poured gasoline on the instability. Now we see what was feared. It is happening in cities across America that are erupting in clashes of all kinds. Big and small, like this one between blue lives matter supporters and Black Lives Matter supporters.(VIDEO PLAYING)MACCALLUM: And then we have seen a huge jump in violent shooting deaths in Milwaukee and Kansas City and Philadelphia, in Chicago, New York, Los Angeles all have numbers that are up surprisingly.Hundreds are dead, including all of these children that you see on your screen in just the past couple of months. But you also remember when shots rang out in the halls of high school in Parkland, Florida, and then in a grammar school before that in Sandy Hook, Connecticut, there was understandable outrage at the deaths of those children rightfully so. And nationwide, calls from Congress to Hollywood to end gun violence.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)ELLEN DEGENERES, HOST, THE ELLEN DEGENERES SHOW: Enough.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Enough.JULIANNE MOORE, ACTOR: Enough.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Demand to plan.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Right now.SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER, D-N.Y.:\u00a0Let us resolve to do something, something about the epidemic of gun violence in this country.REP. NANCY PELOSI, D-CALIF.: The epidemic of gun violence in America. That's a national emergency. Why don't you declare that emergency, Mr. President?(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: So now, with some exceptions, we hear pretty much next to nothing about gun violence from some of these same people. 36 children were killed in primary and secondary school shootings in all of 2018 and 2019. Far too many. We have already covered the shootings and the deaths of dozens of children just since Memorial Day in this country. So, where is the outrage for these kids? Why do they seem to matter less to some people as the country reels in stress and conflict and murder?So, as New York Congressman Peter King watched this scene of Mayor de Blasio painting Black Lives Matter on Fifth Avenue in front of the cameras, he called that a publicity stunt, saying this under de Blasio is leadership, blacks are being murdered at a higher rate than at any time in almost 25 years. And here's President Trump at the White House earlier today.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: 358 percent increase in shootings in New York. Last month, over 300 people were shot. NYPD retirements have quadrupled and they're going up even further and New York City is out of control.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: New York City is out of control, he says. So, in a moment, Congressman King will join us. Also, on THE STORY tonight, John Ayala, the grandfather of this beautiful little boy, Davon McNeal. He was shot over 4th of July weekend in Washington, D.C. So, we're going to get an update on the four suspects there.Also, tonight, Trump Campaign National Press Secretary Hogan Gidley will join me on whether or not the Republican convention is going to happen, whether it will go forward in Florida next month, just few weeks away. And former attorney general now Alabama Senate candidate Jeff Sessions on the state of his primary race, which is tomorrow. And it's a hotly contested one in President Trump plays a big role in that situation. So, we'll talk to Jeff Sessions coming up tonight as well. But we begin, as I mentioned, with Congressman Peter King.Congressman, good to see you. Thank you very much for being here tonight.REP. PETER KING, R-N.Y.: Thank you, Martha.MACCALLUM: You know, I mean, it strikes me when we've covered a lot of these terrible stories of these young people like Davon McNeal, who was shot in D.C. and another young one-year-old who was killed this weekend in New York City. And you don't see the same kind of outrage for these children that we saw for the other children who were also mercilessly killed in those school shootings. Why do you think that is?KING: I think there's so much hypocrisy here, Martha. Whether it's a Black Lives Matter movement, whether it's progressive politicians like Mayor de Blasio and Governor Cuomo and Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez.The fact is that they are more interested I think in pushing a political agenda. I mean listen, everyone agreed, totally agreed that the murder of George Floyd was horrendous. So, since then, we've had riots and demonstrations. We had demonstrations in New York, against the NYPD. We should not have one questionable shooting last year at all, 36,000 cops, 35 shots were fired, the whole year. Only 35 cops even fired the weapons last year. There were five African Americans killed and four of those five had guns or knives. So, far more white shot than blacks in New York.So, all these demonstrations out in the streets denouncing the cops, cursing at the cops, throwing bricks at them, Molotov cocktails. That again was allowed to happen and encouraged. And that encourages the violence. As a result, the cops that's slowly pulling back, there's restrictions put on them as what they can do. They can't even get somebody in a headlock. And as result of that, the thousands of lives that have been saved in the minority communities are now being lost.I mean, I guess maybe 350 shootings since Memorial Day in New York and over 75 murders. 98 percent of the shootings were committed against minorities. And 100 percent of the murder victims are African American. And they would turn their own communities. And that's what the cops have been able to prevent over the last 25 years. But because of these progressive policies and paging Black Lives Matter, which is a radical, as far as I'm concerned, semi-terrorist organization, they're focusing on that and ignoring the fact that innocent black kids - last night, a one-year-old kid was shot down in the streets of Brooklyn at a family outing.MACCALLUM: As you say, there's a very wide spectrum when people say Black Lives Matter. You know, you've got, kids wearing T-shirts that say Black Lives Matter, suburban homes with signs on their front lawn. And then you've got the radical element that is at the heart and the core of it, which is an admittedly Marxist organization. So, it's a very wide spectrum when people use that phrase. I just want to point out.Here's Mayor de Blasio because he did comment on the death of Davell Gardner this morning. And here's how he talked about it. Watch this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BILL DE BLASIO, MAYOR OF NEW YORK: It's heartbreaking for so many reasons. And it begins with the fact that there are just so many guns out there and that is a New York tragedy and a national tragedy.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: Is that the problem?KING: The guns are on the street now because the cops have been pulled back. The cops took more guns off the street over the last several years that can be imagined. But now that unit which was going after guns has been disbanded because it was considered too offensive.So, yes, there are guns on the street, and they're being used by the bad guys. And I wish Mayor de Blasio realize that when he went after the cops, every person in New York should thank the NYPD for the job they've done, especially the African Americans, the minorities living in those communities, which they are the ones whose lives have been saved.We went from 2000 murders a year, the overwhelming majority were black and Hispanic. Now, that was done under 300 last year. Now it's gone back up again. So again, these people who - they have blood on their hands, these politicians, and media people - in New York today and the media stories in the local news, the shooting of that boy, he was like fourth or fifth down. The main story was that somebody threw red paint on the Black Lives Matter side in the middle of the street. That shows how our priorities out of whack. And we got to turn this around or the country is going to be lost.MACCALLUM: Peter King. Congressman, thank you very much. Good to have you here tonight.KING: Thank you, Martha.MACCALLUM: Joining me now, Juan Williams, Fox News Political Analyst, and co-host of The Five. Juan, great to have you with us as well. What's your reaction to that?JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS HOST: Thank you.MACCALLUM: Because we talked so much and we heard so much from, you know, as I said, from members on Capitol Hill to Hollywood folks about these horrific school shootings. And yet we don't hear from them about these children being killed in the middle of this, because the narrative that goes along with it doesn't necessarily fit the things that they seem to be wanting right now.WILLIAMS: I see it a little differently.MACCALLUM: OK.WILLIAMS: I mean, I think obviously, after what we saw in Newtown, after what we saw down in Florida at that high school, and I could go on. Nothing gets done. Even President Trump was saying, you know, we can do something here. He's going to get a deal with the NRA, and nothing gets done.And now you're focusing on, you know, the easy availability of guns in cities that often have strict gun control laws, but they can't control neighboring states and guns flow in the market of illegal, the black market of illegal guns.MACCALLUM: But here's one of the problems with that--WILLIAMS: Aggressive and active.MACCALLUM: That Peter King just mentioned. And, you know, I had a conversation with a former New York City detective who was part of that plainclothes force when he was on the force. And this discussion I had with him was back in, I think it was probably April and when that decision was made that that group was going to be disbanded. He said, you watch what's going to happen this summer in the city. It's going to be horrific because those plainclothes police officers are the ones who get those guns. And in many cases, drugs attached to them off the street.So now, what you've got is basically gang warfare, being able to play out because they know that there's nobody on the street who is a police officer who's not dressed as a police officer. So, they have nothing to fear. These guys in the video that I saw of them coming out and shooting this young boy was so unbelievable.So, they are operating, these gangs are operating in an environment that is much more open and easy for them at this point, Juan.WILLIAMS: Well, I don't know why that unit was disbanded, Martha. But I will say that you have a situation right now in the aftermath of the George Floyd video, where everybody, including Peter King, I will say it was horrific what happened, that you have a police officer kneeling on a man's neck and killing the man like that. So, I think there's more scrutiny and more questions about what we - the authority, the power that we give to police and how they act and behave. So, I don't know that it's necessarily related to the disbanding of this unit that you are talking about that was pulling after guns.MACCALLUM: Well, that was part of the reason that that unit was disbanded because the thinking was that they were walking around--WILLIAMS: They were just disbanded since then?MACCALLUM: Oh, yes. They were disbanded in early May, I believe. And this force of 600 police officers who used to walk around New York City getting guns off the street as undercover police officers, it was determined that they were not fair, that they weren't playing the game fairly and that they needed to be redistributed.WILLIAMS: Well, I don't know.MACCALLUM: Well, that's what happened. Mayor de Blasio wanted that whole group disbanded.WILLIAMS: Well, here's what I think. Well, here's what I think. I think that's a pretty short-term consequence. But my sense is that you have here - my sense of it is, first of all, that this is not as was described by Peter King. First of all, Black Lives Matter. I don't think most Americans would identify them as any terrorist organization. I think that what you have is overwhelming protest against abuse of power by police and bad apples in the police department that need to be reined in that the police--MACCALLUM: But the result, Juan.WILLIAMS: People who protect bad cops.MACCALLUM: But the result is that you are seeing these children get killed and people get murdered in our cities in America because the police have been told to pull back.WILLIAMS: That's not what I think. I think you have, first of all, in black and brown neighborhoods, low income black and brown neighborhoods with the summer, with the fact that people were pent up with the Coronavirus. Now that you have this explosion and it is horrific. And guess what? There are lots of people who are not involved, like these children who get killed, Martha. And it's just tragic and it's wrong.And I hope Black Lives Matter would stand up and say that's wrong and that this kind of murder, as you see it, mostly black on black is not good. It's terrible. And the people inside the black community, my community should be outraged about it, just as we're outraged over abuse of police power.But to somehow tie it and say, oh, police aren't doing their job. First of all, I think police take an oath and I respect the police and I think they do their job. So, it's not their responsibility. You had some thug or gangster or a drug dealer pulling a trigger.MACCALLUM: There's clearly less interaction because police officers hesitate. And that I mean - I think that's pretty well known in many of these departments. They'll tell you that they think twice about entering certain situations because they don't want to end up being that guy. And, you know, everybody understands that what we saw with George Floyd was horrific. I think there's universal opinion on that and on any similar situation.But what's happening is that people are dying as a result of the policies that we're seeing play out here. And I think that, you know, this this is a situation where all these little children's lives matter immensely and we need to think twice about it. So, I thank you very much for being here tonight, talking to me. Thanks, Juan.WILLIAMS: You're welcome. That's a good conversation.MACCALLUM: Good to see you, Juan. So, coming up, President Trump today insisting that his nominating convention will happen, but there are reports that some in the campaign are wondering, is it really worth it? Do people decide who to vote for based on these big conventions? 2020 Press Secretary Hogan Gidley here on that and more. And then Karl Rove and Chris Hahn will weigh in on these polls that we're seeing in Texas and in Florida where COVID-19 has dug in. Coming up next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Are you going to be able to hold the convention in Jacksonville with all this virus spreading?TRUMP: Well, we're going to see it built up a little bit, but we're going to do something that will be great.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: President Trump pressing ahead with plans for the Republican convention in Jacksonville, Florida, as his state deals with a surge in COVID-19 cases. There are some growing questions about what this convention may actually look like in the end. Here now, Hogan Gidley, Trump's 2020 National Press Secretary with a new title at the campaign. Hogan, good to see you tonight. Thank you very much for being here. So, 100 percent definite convention in Florida?HOGAN GIDLEY, TRUMP 2020 NATIONAL PRESS SECRETARY: We're looking to move forward with it in Jacksonville. The President's very excited about it. But, of course, he wants the American people to be safe. He cares about the health and safety and security of the people that would come to that convention. And there'll be a lot of them, I can promise you that. But we're working with people on the ground, too, with Governor DeSantis in his office, the mayor as well, the RNC, all the local officials. And quite frankly, the health experts, because we want to make sure if we proceed forward, how it looks and the measures that need to be in place to make sure that when this thing goes off, it goes off safe.MACCALLUM: So, if we proceed, I heard in there, so it sounds like there is an opening that this might not happen. Are there people within the campaign who are arguing for? Look, it doesn't matter. We can do this a different way this time around.GIDLEY: No, people are excited because they want to see this this convention happen. It's been you know; this country has seen an unprecedented, unforeseen crisis in the pandemic coming from China. And as we work our way through this and we put the health measures in place to make sure the American people are safe, it's time to get back out and enjoy life. And one of the ways we can do that is with this convention.But at the same time, as I said, the president cares about the health and safety of the American people. So, we're going to proceed in the best way possible.MACCALLUM: All right. So, what's the likelihood that you're going to do something outside and that there will be social distancing at this event? I know there were a couple of places that have been looked at outside. It was something that a lot of people thought maybe should have been considered right up - out of the gate. And why wasn't it?GIDLEY: Sure. Well, look, we're looking at all the options out there. The President wants to go into the great state of Florida. One of the states, a pundit said he could never win. That helped catapult him into the White House and thank them for all of their hard work. They want to hear the man speak, you know as well as I do, whether it's a rally or a convention speech. People will do anything and everything to get in and hear this man and cheer him on and thank him for improving their lives.And when you look at the vision the President is putting forward of a great America, making this country get through this pandemic and better on the backside of it, the uplifting, patriotic message he has. And compare and contrast that with Joe Biden, who wants to defund the police and thinks America is now in the cause of all the problems--MACCALLUM: You say a lot of people want to turn out and they always historically have. You know, obviously the crowds at these rallies have historically been enormous. But Tulsa wasn't a great experience, then New Hampshire got canceled. So that has to be forcing a little bit of a different conversation at the campaign right now.GIDLEY: Look, again, I would argue Tulsa was successful. 11 million people saw that thing. That's incredible. Broke all kinds of record.MACCALLUM: On TV.GIDLEY: I think New Hampshire just because of the weather. Listen, we want to proceed, but we want to do it in a proper way. The President cares about the safety and security of the American people, as I said. And so, we'll look at all options. But the fact is, we're moving forward with this convention in Jacksonville. We want people to be safe. And we're looking forward to getting the President's message out there.MACCALLUM: So, one of the other messages that has been out there is, you know, sort of where to place the blame for some of the numbers that are a little soft right now and we're early out. I think a lot of people don't make up their mind about these things till well after Labor Day and certainly after these conventions, if they happen and the debates are going to be a huge data point here as well.But the things that have floated out from even members of the task force is and from the President as well, a little bit of finger pointing at Dr. Fauci, like, well, you know, maybe he should have told us earlier to wear masks. Then also finger pointing at the head of the campaign, Brad Parscale. There was a piece in The Washington Post today sort of suggesting that there's some blame going in that direction. Is that fair?GIDLEY: No, it's not. I'm going to break some news on your program tonight. I'll give you some numbers that no one knows. And that's this, to all of our media platforms right now, we just eclipse a milestone. No one knows about this. So, again, just for you, Martha, 1.1 billion views of our show we put forth on the Trump networks. 107 shows, the President has only participated in a few of them. The excitement is out there. People are engaged. They want to get out and vote for this President.And when you see the numbers of registered Republicans outpacing that of Democrats in key swing states, we're doing something right. Money raised at a pace no one thought possible. And it's because we have a great candidate. Make no mistake, when you're talking about Joe Biden, you don't have to guess what his economy would look like.You saw it for eight years, depressed wages, jobs leaving shores, 3 million of them go into China alone. You don't have to guess what the culture would look like. He pops out of his basement every once in a while, to say defund the police. The fact is, our jobs aren't safe, our families aren't safe, and our American way of life is not safe with Joe Biden, because he is waging war on all three policies.MACCALLUM: A very different reality right now. And everybody's forced to kind of think creatively and do their business in a creative way. And I think that works in the campaign environment as well. And we'll see how it all plays out. Hogan, thank you very much. Good to have you here tonight.GIDLEY: It does. Thank you.MACCALLUM: Next up, Karl Rove, former Deputy Chief of Staff to President George W. Bush and a Fox News Contributor. Chris Hahn is a former aide to Senator Chuck Schumer and a syndicated radio host. Good to have both of you with us tonight.CHRIS HAHN, FORMER AIDE TO CHUCK SCHUMER: Great to be here.MACCALLUM: Karl, what do you think? Does the convention have to happen, and does it have to happen in Jacksonville? Does it have to happen the way it usually does? What do you think?KARL ROVE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, it won't happen the way it usually does, because typically these are gigantic festivals for the Democrats and Republicans. Lots of donors, lots of activists, lots of interest groups. They swarmed the convention site. They go on for a week or two before the convention begins. There are enormous crowds during the convention. Many of them never get into the hall, but they go to the parties. They go to events. They go to the satellite. You've seen them. You've been at a couple of these.MACCALLUM: Yes, I've been at a lot of them.ROVE: That's not going to happen.MACCALLUM: Yes.ROVE: And it's going to be a slimmed down version. The key is going to be, can the Democrats and the Republicans both figure out how to showcase their candidate's acceptance speech, because typically, historically, going back to the beginning of the TV age, the moment of the acceptance speech is the most watched point of the campaign, except the presidential debates. And so, as they're going to be looking for ways to do that, it's going to be interesting to see how they deal with it in a time play.MACCALLUM: It's going to be fascinating. I mean, they've only got a few weeks to hammer this out. And I think, you know, everybody's got to put it their creative hats on and come up with something that is going to, you know, really wow people, and get them to tune in.Let's take a look at some of these polls and get Chris's reaction. And then Karl's reaction. So, the first poll that we have is - what do we have there? Texas. Arizona. There is Arizona, Arizona is flat. 46-46. Florida has Biden up by 6 points right now. And Texas has Trump up by only 1 point. Chris, have at it? What you see there?HAHN: Well, you know, I told Karl on this program a few weeks ago that Texas is going to be in play. Texas is going to be in play. The average of polls in Texas right now is 0.1 percent for Trump on the average of polls. I think Biden is going to win Texas especially, hopefully somebody senior in the Bush family will come out and endorse Biden in Texas. That will put him over the top. I don't know if George itself, but it's going to happen.MACCALLUM: So, Karl is that going to happen? Is George Bush going to come out and endorse Joe Biden.ROVE: You know, it's an unusual for a major media figure like Chris Hahn to visibly demonstrate that he's smoking dope on television. It's amazing. I mean, it's really--HAHN: Hey now.MACCALLUM: Chris, you're not smoking dope, are you?ROVE: The American people can believe that Texas is in play. The American - no, obviously, I'm kidding. But he is, like, weird. So, we can believe that Texas is absolutely in play when Joe Biden comes down here and buys a lot of TV and appoints even a state chairman.HAHN: He's going to.ROVE: Let me finish, Chris, please, for once, for God's sake, please.MACCALLUM: Go ahead.ROVE: So, but until that happens, we can - look, the state's going to be close. No ifs, ands or buts about it. But the idea that this is a state that is in play and is a top target of the Democrats, I have yet to see, you know, they're not even a Biden state chairman. There's no staff on the ground. There's no TV buys. There's no--HAHN: Here's why?ROVE: It's not there.MACCALLUM: Final thought, Chris.HAHN: Here's why it's in play. Abbott and Warso (ph) Dan Patrick, two Trump clones have ruined the recovery to COVID-19, in Texas. It has made more people's lives in danger and it has endangered the economy of Texas and the nation as a whole. So that just--ROVE: I just saw a poll looking at that and Governor Abbott's approval rating at 66 percent approval rating. He didn't like your Governor Cuomo. He did not send people with COVID to nursing homes--(CROSSTALK)MACCALLUM: You go ahead.HAHN: Please, please Karl. Karl, you're going to need multiple whiteboards to figure out a map for Donald Trump to win this presidency. He's such a failure. He's failed on so many levels in so many states. I am so dizzy--(CROSSTALK)ROVE: You've got to get a new rap. We keep hearing this every time we're together.MACCALLUM: We're going to keep this--(CROSSTALK)ROVE: Say something substantive--MACCALLUM: I think it's similar conversation. I'm not exactly sure if it was with you, Chris Hahn. But I know Karl Rove said that Beto O'Rourke would never win Texas and that he could see that that was never going to happen. And, you know, so here we are or--ROVE: Martha, one thing here.HAHN: As bad a candidate--ROVE: One thing before we go. Chris said that Biden is going to win Texas. I want to bet a $1000 Chris's favorite charity, not a political group, but a charity. If he'll bet a $1000 to my favorite charity, that I say Biden doesn't win Texas. He says Biden does. Let's see if he's going to man up right now.HAHN: I need odds, Karl. I need odds.(CROSSTALK)MACCALLUM: All right, bye guys. Talk to you next time. All right. Coming up, Dr. Scott Atlas says that science proves he's very emphatic about this. He says schools absolutely must reopen and he says the science demands that they do. He's back with his argument right after this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: Schools should be opened. Schools should be opened. Kids want to go to school.(END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)MACCALLUM: The latest political divide appears to be going back to school with Democrats mostly urging caution and Republicans mostly, starting with the president, saying that kids need to get back into the classroom or risk a learning loss that maybe irreparable.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. NANCY PELOSI, D-CALIF.,\u00a0SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE: Going back to school presents the biggest risk for the spread of the coronavirus. They ignore science and they ignore governance in order to make this happen. If there are CDC guidelines, they should be requirements.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: Dr. Scott Atlas, senior fellow at Stanford University Hoover Institution and former chief of neuroradiology at Stanford University Medical Center. Doctor, welcome back to the program. Good to have you.SCOTT ATLAS, PROFESSOR AND CHIEF OF NEURORADIOLOGY, STANFORD UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER: Thanks, Martha.MACCALLUM: She says, Nancy Pelosi says that this is the biggest risk to the spread of the virus if the kids go back in September.ATLAS: I think we have a different scale because that's just completely wrong and contrary to all the science. And when I say, when I say all the science, I'm talking about signs all over the world not just in the United States but Switzerland, Sweden, Canada, France, the Netherlands, Australia, Asia.I mean, it's totally contrary to the science and here's the science, I'm not sure how many times it has to be said but the risk to children from this disease for fatality is nearly zero. The risk to children for a significant illness is, quote, \"far less from seasonal flu\" according to JAMA Pediatrics.I mean, this is totally antithetical to the data. And the other thing that we have to, obviously we know this by now it's been confirmed all over the world. Children rarely transmit the disease to adults. This is --(CROSSTALK)MACCALLUM: Well that's the biggest concern, if -- pardon me for hopping in, but that's the quickest rebuttal to that. That, you know, yes, but these kids aren't going to realize their carriers, they're going to go home and infect their parents or their grandparents.ATLAS: Well, but those are people that obviously either don't know the data or are refractory to learning themselves because the facts say otherwise. And this has been proven by contract tracing all over the world by studies on these kids. This is like really ludicrous.But I think the most important thing of all, well, the other -- there's two points that I want to make. One is that teaching is a young profession. In the United States half the teachers are 40 or less and a quarter of them are under 30. Ninety percent are under 60 in public schools.They have almost zero risk from this and for those high risk teachers, which there are some, if they believe in masks and social distancing, don't think they know how to do that by now, and if they're still afraid to do their job, why can't they teach from a distance? If they think social distancing works, teach in a class, if they think a distance learning works, teach from home.But the problem here and this the biggest point of all, I never hear anyone talk about the harms of closing schools. The harms are against the children. Anyone who prioritizes children would open the schools. That's just counterfactual to say that, you know, the children are not the risk or, you know, were at risk here.When we see the harms to children, most children learn most of what's in schools from social engagement, from learning how to resolve conflicts from dealing with others.MACCALLUM: Yes. So true.ATLAS: This is obvious. When children learned that they need a hearing aid or glasses, that's done in school. There are over almost a quarter of a million apparently reported child abuse cases --MACCALLUM: Yes.ATLAS: -- missed because children's child abuse is most noticed in the schools. And so, I mean, I'm not sure. We are the only country in the world, this is a level of hysteria like this is something I feel like I'm living in a Kafka novel here. I mean, I get thousands of e-mails a week from all over the world, from professors, teachers, mothers in the United States and elsewhere, they are stunned that we are willing to just simply destroy our children out of some bizarre notion that is completely contrary to the science.MACCALLUM: Yes. I mean, we watched some countries in Scandinavia that went right back. The kids all went right back and they did very well. So, this is really important, you know, that the kids they -- the learning deficit is so dramatic and we're going to talk to Betsy DeVos about this later in the week.But Dr. Atlas, I got to go but thank you so much. Always good to have you with us.ATLAS: All right.MACCALLUM: Coming up, former Attorney General Jeff Sessions served in the United States Senate for than 20 years and now he faces the fight of his life to get back there after an ugly divorce from his time in the Trump administration. Remember this?(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP:\u00a0They put this country through, Jeff Sessions was a disaster. He was a total disaster because he basically let it happen, unknowingly, because he is not very smart.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: Well, he see that criticism quite a bit from the president. He is here tonight to talk about that and about his Senate race hours ahead of a crucial run-off in Alabama, coming up next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)MACCALLUM: Ever since Jeff Sessions left his attorney general post President Trump has been trashing his earliest Capitol Hill supporter. Now the president is backing Sessions' opposition Republican Tommy Tuberville in tomorrow's primary runoff tweeting this. Big Senate race in Alabama on Tuesday, but T. Tuberville he is a winner who will never let you down. Jeff Sessions is a disaster who let us all down. We don't want him back in Washington.To which Jeff Sessions clap back, I've taken the road less traveled, not sought fame or fortune, my honor and integrity are far more important than these juvenile insults. Your scandal ridden candidate is too cowardly to debate, as you know Alabama does not take orders from Washington.Joining me now, less than five more hours until runoff date, Jeff Sessions, former attorney general and 2020 Alabama Senate candidate. Good to see you, sir. Thank you very much for being here tonight.JEFF SESSIONS, FORMER U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL: Thank you, Martha.MACCALLUM: We have a poll from May, I want to point out that this is a very old poll but there are several polls that show you double digits behind Mr. Tuberville. How are you feeling as you head into tomorrow given that?SESSIONS: Thanks. I'm moving our way there's no doubt about it, our campaign is catching fire people are finally beginning to ask who is our opponent? Where did he come from? He just passed through Alabama 18 months ago. He claimed for tax purposes his home in Florida. He is wrong on trade, wrong on immigration, wrong on China.He's not been advocating for the Trump agenda that I have been advocating for. His name is going to be on the ballot tomorrow, not President Trump's.MACCALLUM: OK.SESSIONS: We'll be voting for him in November but the choice is clear. My opponent is hiding out, he rejected coming on your program. He rejected Bret Baier's program, he's gone radio silence in the state --MACCALLUM: All right.SESSIONS: -- since the scandals have broken there.MACCALLUM: Let me ask you this. You know, it's interesting that you say that you -- one of the things that you would do if you get to go to the Senate would be to defend President Trump's policies. Even though every chance that he gets he tries to undermine you in this campaign. How do you do that?SESSIONS: The president has strong feelings about this and he gets to express those opinions, but let me tell you. I was for those policies before he announced. I was the number one voice in the Senate for them. I believe in them. Not because of any personal gain but because I think they're right for America and Alabama.He needs stronger voices in the Senate. The Senate is not speaking out sufficiently on trade, on immigration, on China. Those are particularly difficult issues. Judges. Religious freedom. Those things, I know about, I fought for, I understand them. I'll help him, I want him to succeed.MACCALLUM: OK.SESSIONS: That's the fundamental thing because it's good for America.MACCALLUM: So, interestingly, I want to ask you a question about what happened with Roger Stone and the commutation which is obviously been a controversial decision. And it's interesting that last week the person who came out after you, Attorney General Bill Barr said that he -- he was asked about the Stone sentence and he said that he thought the sentence for him was fair given the crime. And he also said that he thought that it was a righteous prosecution. Do you agree?SESSIONS: Well, I don't know the details of that case. I would just say the president clearly has the power to pardon. President Obama did 200. One of them was a terrorist who was teaching people how to make bombs to blow up the United States.So, the president has this power. I respect Attorney General Barr. I like the fact that he's digging into all these matters, these allegations of unfairness and federal abuses in FBI and prosecutors. I think this matter, this Russia matter, can never be completed until the American people have a belief that the investigators themselves have been evaluated properly and wrongdoing punished wherever it occurring.MACCALLUM: All right. Former Attorney General and Senate candidate in Alabama, once again, Jeff Sessions. Thank you very much. Good to see you, sir.SESSIONS: Thank you.MACCALLUM: So, this little boy is 11-year-old Davon McNeal. He was shot and killed by a stray bullet during a Fourth of July peace cookout that was organized by his family to bring people together in his community. He's quite the young athlete, had a bright future ahead of him.One of the suspects connected to his murder was recently released from prison because of COVID-19 and they wanted to let people out. Davon's grandfather, John Ayala who you met here last week wants to update us on what's going on in this case. He says that a violent offender never should have been let out of prison. He is here next. Don't miss it when we come back.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: He shot my baby in his head. He got shot in his head. It looks so bad.(END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOHN AYALA, DAVON MCNEAL'S GRANDFATHER: He gets out of the car, shots ring. He hits the ground, Crystal looks and saying get up. You don't get up, so she goes to see what's going on and realize that he was hit with one of the bullets that was being shot.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: That's the grandfather of a 11-year-old Davon McNeal describing the senseless shooting that took the life of his grandson over the Fourth of July weekend. When asked about Davon's football coach said, quote, \"we just had a real genuine kid who wanted to get out of the neighborhood. That's all he said, is I'm going to make it.\"There are four suspects at least connected to Davon's killing, two have been arrested including 22-year-old Christian Wingfield who was in custody for possession of a firearm but released because of the COVID-19 outbreak when they left numbers of people out of prisons to control the outbreak.So, two of the other suspects are still out there, still on the run. And police are working on a warrant for a fifth alleged shooter we have learned in this case.Davon McNeal's grandfather, John Ayala is here once again on THE STORY with me tonight. He is the founder of the D.C. chapter of the Guardian Angels, an organization that works with police to prevent a crime.Mr. Ayala, thank you so much for joining me tonight. And again, I just -- my heart breaks for you and your family and your grandson was a beautiful kid. I'm sorry for your loss. What do you think about this news that one of these men was released from prison because of COVID-19?AYALA: I am absolutely outraged. Just about a month ago, I was watching the news up in New York City. About the same thing happening and someone was released during the COVID-19 within 24 hours committed a murder. Then here in D.C. we had a young man that was 16 years old also released from COVID. Sixteen. And within 30 days after that being released, he shot nine people. And of those nine, four are deceased.This is a young man at 16 years old running around with the guns. Now in his home, you know, another young man that was brought up on gun charges released because of COVID.MACCALLUM: Yes.AYALA: And him and his friends decided to tote their weapons and get involved in the turf war. He shot my grandson. I don't know -- I mean, I don't even know they were out there, they shot my grandson and this probably could have been avoided if he was still locked out. We don't know who was the leader, was he the leader of this?MACCALLUM: Yes.AYALA: Were the other guys? We don't know. But what I do know is that he should have been in prison not on the streets.MACCALLUM: What is your message to the other individuals that were involved in the shooting which is being a premeditated first-degree murder?AYALA: I definitely -- I definitely see that because these gentlemen knew what they were doing. The sad thing is, two of these guys actually attended Crystal stop the violence cookout. Actually, he was over there. They posted pictures on their Instagram page. And then they go out right after and they kill her son. You know, you guys, the guy would be watching, you got to turn yourself in.(CROSSTALK)MACCALLUM: Why? I mean, what do you say to the people -- they have to turn themselves in if they're watching. I want to make sure that message gets out there. So, give everybody, why --(CROSSTALK)AYALA: Yes, definitely.MACCALLUM: -- what happened? What was that turf war about, why are they out there, you know, ending these young lives?AYALA: You know, I don't know what the turf war is about but these young guys in the community, what happens if there some kind of beef among them, usually it's one person that gets deceased in another community because of a shooting.They don't believe in telling the police. It's revenge. So, they come back and forth they shoot up each other's community and when they do that, they don't care who's around. They don't care if it's children, grandmothers, parents. They just want somebody from that community to lose their life.MACCALLUM: To pay the price.AYALA: So that community can be in mourning and that is the worst attitude that anybody can have.MACCALLUM: John, thank you so much, John Ayala. We'll keep on THE STORY. We'll be right back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)MACCALLUM: That's the story of Monday, July 13, 2020. But as always, the story continues so we'll see you back here tomorrow night.

Hey there Bret. Good to see you. Have a good weekend. All right, here we go. Good evening everybody. I'm Martha MacCallum and this is The Story. For the last several days, this first story tonight has been one of the most talked about controversies on Capitol Hill. It's not about the virus or about the stimulus package. It's about what one member of Congress calls an abrupt conversation and another calls a verbal assault. As Americans start to show reservations about rampant cancel culture, this harsh moment between colleagues seems to be ballooning into something bigger. Tonight, in an exclusive interview Congressman Ted Yoho is here to talk about his side of the story. Here is what Representative Ocasio-Cortez says he did to her. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ (D-NY): I was minding my own business, walking up the steps And Rep. Yoho put his finger in my face. He called me disgusting. He called me crazy. He called me out of my mind. And he called me dangerous. In front of reporters Rep. Yoho called me and I quote, (EXPLETIVE DELETED) (END VIDEO CLIP) And here is it Rep. Yoho, Republican from Florida who is not running for re-election, giving his statement on the event. Watch this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. TED YOHO (R-FL): I rise to apologize for the abrupt manner of the conversation I had with my colleague from New York. It is true that we disagree on policies and visions for America but that does not mean we should be disrespectful. Having been married for 45 years with two daughters, I'm very cognizant of my language. The offensive name-calling words attributed to me by the press were never spoken to my colleague and if they were construed that way, I apologize for their misunderstanding. I cannot apologize for my passion or for loving my God. My family and my country. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: Rep. Ocasio-Cortez has made this not about her and Mr. Yoho but she says it is much bigger than that. She says it's about our culture that is accepting of violence and violent language against women. Rep. Yoho joins us exclusively in just a moment. Also coming up tonight on The Story, we'll talk to Professor Joshua Catz who said no more to calls at Princeton to offer compensation perks based on race and much more. We'll talk about that with him in this exclusive interview that we had with him tonight. Then Victor Davis Hanson will join us on the other end of that as well. Also, tonight Congressman Eric Swalwell and Andy McCarthy on yet more breaking news on how the FBI did surveillance on the Trump team. Also, tonight, former NFL player Jack Brewer as baseball kicks off but not before the players kneeled for Black Lives Matter but we begin as promised evening with Congressman Ted Yoho. Congressman, thank you very much for joining us tonight. I know it's been a heck of a week for you and we're glad you came here tonight to sort of tell your side of the story. So it seems that what prompted this on your end at least according to what we're hearing, is that you were appalled by the comments that she made about the fact that poverty and unemployment was leading people to commit crimes. Is that what sparked you? YOHO: That was part of it. Yes. I mean but it's been a series of things. I could go into that but that was something and I just, I asked her if we could have minute of her time and ask her a question. MACCALLUM: You did? Because she said you just accosted her and she didn't know what was coming at her and then she said you called her disgusting. Did you call her disgusting? YOHO: No ma'am. I was coming down from voting from the Capitol as I walk across as I always do and I was coming up just she was coming up the stairs and I asked her, I said, Hey do you have a minute? She goes yes. And we've never had a conversation before, and I wanted to ask her about this policy that she was telling people it's OK to shoplift if you're hungry and it went backwards from there. MACCALLUM: So, did - all right, did you call her disgusting, and did you suggest that she was losing her mind? YOHO: No. MACCALLUM: Did you use those words? You never said she was disgusting? You never said she was losing her mind? YOHO: No, everything was directed at policy. When she told me that yes, she thought it was right for people to go ahead and shoplift if you're hungry, I said seriously where there's many social programs and faith-based programs and all these other food kitchens around, the best that you can do is to offer people in your district to go ahead and shoplift while you're calling at the same time to defund the police. I said those are just absolutely the most fricking, crazy policy ideas I've ever heard, and I said your policy ideas are disgusting and I turned around walked away. MACCALLUM: Now when you turned around and walked away - YOHO: And that is as long as that interaction lasted. MACCALLUM: OK, these stories are so totally different that the two of you are telling so it's kind of hard to know you know which version is the truth but when you turned around and walked down the stairs, did you refer to her as a f-word b-word. YOHO: No, I walked down the steps. I said this is just such a fricking BS and that's all I said and then a reporter came up to me and said what was that about. I said no comment. Did you say this. I said no comment and I left. You know there's another part of the story that's not being told, that she doesn't tell and I don't want to get into that because the policies that they're telling, to tell people you don't have to fund the police department, we need to defund it. I mean, it got defunded in New York, $1.5 billion and then to go out and tell people it's OK to shoplift. Well, I don't believe it's OK for the shop owner who owns that stores, trying to make a living for his family to have somebody come and say well Ms. Ocasio-Cortez says it's OK or what about the student or the child that's watching this with her mom and dad and well, I guess, I can go and shoplift mom. She said it was OK. These are the things that are tearing this country apart and it needs to stop and I can go on and on but I don't want to because I know that's not the purpose of this. These are the policies. MACCALLUM: I'm just curious. You said that she's not telling the truth about. What is that? Because you know this story, I was actually surprised at how much traction it's got but it's getting a ton of attention. People are clicking on it all the time so is there something else that we need to know about what happened between you two? YOHO: Well, I thought it was interesting like I said, I've never had a dialogue with her and I've been meaning to but with the pandemic and the way Washington's working, we're running out of time and I wanted to address this and I do this with a lot of members and I've done this with many members, questioning policies and just to try to get to where they understand. You know so we have an understanding but as I was coming back from my second vote series, I was walking back to my office and all of a sudden, I hear somebody go Ted Yoho. She yells it out. I turn around and she's pointing her finger at me, she goes Ted Yoho, I am not done with you. I'm like OK. And I mean like I said, and so I guess you see what's going on now is she's making hay out of this. She's fund raising off of this. She's out in front of the capitol wearing her COVID-19 mask playing that song boss, I'm not going to say it. Playing boss so and so. Making fun of this but yet she's on the floor, crying saying how bad this is but yet she's out there saying the same thing and you know it's disingenuous. In the meantime, I haven't said a word about this. MACCALLUM: All right so you think she's leveraging this. YOHO: I've been going. MACCALLUM: Yes. YOHO: Well, I mean - MACCALLUM: Well, you got up on the floor and you said, and you apologized. She said she didn't consider that an apologize. I'm sorry that we keep stepping on each other. We do have a little bit of a delay, but she then came back to your latest statement and she said that she didn't see what you said as an apology at all. She said if he wants to continue to lie about what happened, that's his business. They think their little man card will be taken away if they apologize for their absurd behavior. That's her most recent comment. YOHO: No. MACCALLUM: What's your reaction to that? YOHO: Well again, what is that attacking? I mean that's attacking a person's character, his manliness I guess is what she's doing and then she spun those into saying that I'm attacking all women and it was women of color. This was strictly policy and those policies are bad for this nation. I mean do you think it's right. I'm going to ask the American people. Do you think it's right to advocate shoplifting instead of going to your representative and getting help and assistance? Whether it's food stamps and I've been on this thing. MACCALLUM: It sounded to me. YOHO: I talked about that. MACCALLUM: Yes, you have. I did hear you say that. You know it sounded to me that that video that she made, got a lot of attention and it did sound like she was excusing some of that behavior. At least she was saying that she understood where she thought it was coming from and she said she wasn't talking about people getting shot in Chicago and Seattle and elsewhere. She said she was talking about small crime that came from people who were out of work but you know what I want to get to is the point that you just touched on because you said I have had similar conversations with other people about policy. Now did you get heated in those conversations. Might any of those people have thought that you were out of line in your language with them and were those people men and were those people women and did they cross the gender line? YOHO: Sure. I've had conversations with Ro Khanna, Terry Sewell, Luis Gutierrez on several things and we don't always walk away agreeing but we always wind up, it seems like afterwards laughing about things and you know we're going to disagree on that but we're always amicable. And you know I'm there to solve problems and there are many problems in this country. MACCALLUM: So she's really laying down the gender card here. Here's part of her speech which got a lot of attention. Let's play that because I want to get you to react to this. YOHO: Sure. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) OCASIO-CORTEZ: This harm that Mr. Yoho levied, tried to levy against me was not just an incident directed at me. But when you do that to any woman what Mr. Yoho did was give permission to other men to do that to his daughters. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: What do you think about that? YOHO: You know she's entitled to her opinion. That is nothing to do with our conversation. It was strictly about her policies and I went to the southwest border the week after she left. I went into the same cell she was in where she said children are being snatched away from their parents and the detainees were made to drink out of the toilet and she was cussing in front of the workers there and what I found out. They said this is a drinking fountain. This is this and so this has been a history of what she's doing and it's identity politics and I don't play that and I've got a pretty good reputation, whether it's up there or down here in my district. I practiced for almost 30 years. I'm not going to try to defend myself. I feel bad for Ms. Ocasio-Cortez who thinks this was - I called these names. I did not call her these names. This was strictly on policy and then again, I've been quiet about this. I'm not, I'm not worried about this. I can - I'm not asking anybody to defend me. I'm not going on YouTube. I'm not out in front of the Capitol playing whatever that boss something, what's that music. We've got serious problems in this nation. We've got $30 trillion in debt. I've got China breathing down our throats and I'm not going to - This is what's wrong with Washington. They'll capitalize on stuff like this and have identity politics and it's not moving this nation forward and it needs to stop. MACCALLUM: Well, you say you've had similar conversation that got heated with men and women and she clearly is trying to make this into an attack on women. She called you out and said that you weren't decent just because you have a wife and daughters so we you know, there's no doubt that she explained this to the hell and she's got a lot of support behind her from Nancy Pelosi and Ayanna Pressley and other folks who are really making this into a much broader topic. You've also got the bread for the world organization suggesting that maybe they should take you off their board. What do you say about that before I let you go? YOHO: Well, I think it's interesting and I saw the clip before this on Fox news that said I was loser of the week. You're supposed to be fair and balanced. Nobody's even talk to me and if the breadth of the almighty wants to do that, that's fine but I think it's funny how the definition of a democracy is mob rule and you're hanging somebody before you even talk to him. That's wrong and that's another thing that's wrong in this country. We need to come together. MACCALLUM: I agree with you there. YOHO: And if we can have - if we have a disagreement, let's talk about it and let's move on and we may not always agree on and I know that. I mean, I've been married for 45 years and anyways, you take care and I thank you for the opportunity to come on here. MACCALLUM: You're very welcome and we always like to hear both sides of the story. We did not call you or anyone else the loser the week. We don't do that segment here, but we also invited her to come on and talk about it as well so. YOHO: I think it was that show before you. MACCALLUM: OK, all right. Ted Yoho Representative, thank you very much and as I said, we - open invitation to Rep. Ocasio-Cortez because clearly these are very divergent stories and we would love to bring you both sides. Thank you, sir. Coming up, new documents reveal that the FBI was using candidate Trump's intelligence briefings as a place to kind of dig around for dirt in his campaign. We're going to tell you more about this when we come back. Stay with us tonight on The Story. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) MACCALLUM: Also, tonight, evidence that the FBI used an intelligence briefing to then candidate Donald Trump to kill two birds with one stone essentially. While they briefed him, they were poking around for any Russia connections that may be revealed by Mr. Trump or General Flynn. A source telling Fox news that the briefing was a \"cover.\" Agent Joe Pianka wrote in a summary, \"During ODNI briefs, writer actively listened for topics or questions regarding the Russian federation.\" Among other categories document was filed under Crossfire Hurricane and Crossfire Razor, the code names for the probes into the Trump campaign and into Michael Flynn and the document was approved by FBI officials Kevin Clinesmith who's name you may recognize from the Carter Page line of this story and Peter Strzok, of course you know of quite well. So President Trump was asked about this newest revelation last night. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: It's a terrible thing that happened. It should never happen to another president. The fact is that President Obama and Vice President Biden and the whole group of them with Brennan and Comey and McCabe and Lisa Page and Strzok, her lover and beyond them, long beyond them ,they spied on the campaign, using the intelligence agencies of our country, they illegally - this is illegal as can be, this is treason. This is many things you can call it. They spied on the campaign of another party. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: So Democratic Congressman Eric Swalwell joins me now. He is a member of the House Intelligence Committee. Congressman, good to have you with us today. REP. ERIC SWALWELL (D-CA): You too. Thanks for having me. MACCALLUM: When I listened to this and I read the documents from - from this story Peter Strzok says at one point that they should use the CI guy in the briefing, a counterintelligence person in this briefing which is supposed to be an intelligence briefing for the candidate to assess the demeanor of the individuals during that briefing. So they had a counterintelligence investigation into this back in August of 2016 based on what we learned from the Mueller investigation was no evidence that there was any connection between the campaign. So this goes back to what Bill Barr said. It's - it's not legal or ethical to spy on a presidential campaign without proper predication. What's your reaction to this new information? SWALWELL: They were right to do it and I hope they do it if a Democratic candidate ever does that with any country so Martha remember, right before this meeting occurred, candidate Trump said Russia, if you're listening, I hope you hack Hillary's emails. And what did they do? They actually did it. MACCALLUM: In front of an enormous crowd on national television. SWALWELL: That doesn't make it better, that makes it worse. That makes it worse. MACCALLUM: You think that's something sneaky and spying? Oh my gosh. SWALWELL: Yes, he wanted them to - MACCALLUM: So, the fact of the matter is that they had - there was no - SWALWELL: Let me finish Martha, let me finish. You asked my thought. MACCALLUM: There was no evidence Eric - SWALWELL: So, I'm going to tell you what I thought so Martha. MACCALLUM: - that there was any connection. No, but I was just blown away by that's your answer. OK, go ahead. SWALWELL: Like if they don't confront him, that's when we would have a problem. So one, he had just recently said that. Two, by the way, he says in the meeting, Joe, are the Russians bad? It's like yes, the Russians are bad and don't eat glue like should we even have to tell you that. Three by the way Martha, he told the country for years that he was never given this briefing and now we learned that he did which is in line with him saying he never had a Trump tower deals and Moscow extending him to do so. MACCALLUM: Yes but no, no, no. SWALWELL: He constantly lies about the Russia, that's what he does. MACCALLUM: So two things, two things. So one is just based on the facts of the story that we have - I've covered for a long time and you have also been involved in for a long time too. So President Trump was under investigation. Jim Comey said he was not. He said that to Congress under oath. So the President was indeed under investigation. SWALWELL: What would you want a counterintelligence official to do when the President is asking the Russians to hack and they're actually hacking. I hope they look into him. I hope if Joe Biden was doing this with any other foreign country that is seeking to influence our elections, that the FBI would look into it. MACCALLUM: That's fine. I'm just saying - SWALWELL: Thankfully it's not. MACCALLUM: - they have to do it properly. SWALWELL: But that's kind of their job. MACCALLUM: You have to base it on evidence and then if you - SWALWELL: And by the way two months before his son met with Russians at Trump tower. MACCALLUM: - we have the President under investigation. SWALWELL: And two months before his son met with Russians at Trump tower. MACCALLUM: So what? You're allowed to meet with Russian people. I mean this - SWALWELL: Are they our friends Martha? MACCALLUM: People meet with Russians all the time. SWALWELL: They were told that they had dirt on Hillary Clinton. MACCALLUM: I mean that meeting was thoroughly investigated and you know as well as I do that they came up with nothing from that meeting and then it's in terms of the briefing, you say that you know he said, he never received a briefing. Everybody in that room was in on the briefing except for the candidate. He's the only one who was not - no one explained to him, look Sir, you are running for president of United States, we have reason to believe that this campaign, that the Russians might be trying to find some soft spots in your team. That is what needed to be said if the concern was as great as you say but that wasn't what was going on. SWALWELL: Because he's the kind of guy that listens to intelligence briefings like he's given pictures and graphs now because he doesn't have the attention span to listen, Martha so they had a challenging job in the beginning. They have a challenging job now. MACCALLUM: So it's about the fact that he's not smart enough. I'm so confused at what you're getting at. OK. SWALWELL: Yes. Picture woman, man, camera, TV. MACCALLUM: OK fine, Congressman, thank you for being here. OK, fine, it doesn't add up to in terms of the counterintelligence investigation. All right, so let's bring in Andy McCarthy, former federal prosecutor and Fox news contributor. Andy, your thoughts on this latest revelation that came out in these documents in terms of putting in a CI person, a counterintelligence person in the middle of this briefing that is now been called a cover. ANDY MCCARTHY, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Martha, it's the same thing that happened when Director Comey used the opportunity to brief Trump after he won the election and they treated that as an investigative event, not an actual briefing. This is the same thing. It's a common tactic. You try to say provocative things in the hope that you're going to get the suspect to say things that are either incriminating or events consciousness of guilt. I just want to say two things. Number one, Trump didn't invite Russia to hack the Mrs. Clinton. In fact at that point in time, the FBI had Mrs. Clinton's servers in their possession. There was nothing to hack at that point and secondly, Trump didn't deny having this briefing. What he's denied which is true is that his campaign was never given a defensive briefing to be given some information that they may have been infiltrated by Russia. It doesn't make sense for them to have done that because Trump, I think was the main suspect but this briefing was not a defensive briefing. This briefing was an intelligence and security briefing that's commonly given to candidates for President. MACCALLUM: So given these documents, which as you say line up with a lot of what we've seen before, everyone wants to know if there's ever going to be any prosecution in any of this and everyone would like to see what the fruits of John Durham's investigation are. Are we going to see that anytime soon and what do you think based on what we're learning now? MCCARTHY: Well, they're saying the end of the summer Martha. I think you're going to get probably two things. You'll probably get some indictments in terms of like the lower level people, if this is the investigation that implicates the very highest level so being low here is relative but you know, you're talking about people who manipulated evidence, made direct misrepresentations to courts. I think they have a lot to worry about. If you're talking about an overarching scheme, where they would get the top players, I don't think you're ever going to see an indictment along those lines but I do think you'll get a narrative report about it. MACCALLUM: Yes. Andy McCarthy, always good to talk you. Thank you very much. MCCARTHY: Thanks Martha. MACCALLUM: Coming up, moving vans seen clearing out sthe China Houston consulate today after an active retaliation from the Chinese government. That's next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MACCALLUM: There is discussion that China may retaliate by asking us to leave one of the six embassies that we have in China, we also have one in Hong Kong. And it looks like Chengdu and potentially Wuhan are at the top of that list. Will we be vacating any of our embassies in China, Mr. Secretary? MIKE POMPEO, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: Martha, let's go back to first principles. And so, the Chinese government will get to make its decisions about our diplomats there inside of China. We'll make sure that we do right by the American people. (END VIDEOTAPE) MACCALLUM: One day after that from Secretary of State Mike Pompeo China is making its decision ordering the closure of the United States consulate in the southwestern city of Chengdu, a move seen as payback for Houston which was shut down this afternoon at the demand of the Trump administration. Reuters reporting tonight that men who appeared to be American officials were seen forcing open the back door with power tools and crowbars after padlocking another door. Joining me now, Dr. Michael Pillsbury, the director of Chinese strategy at Hudson Institute and the author of \"The Hundred-Year Marathon.\" Dr. Pillsbury, always good to see you. I want to start by putting up a piece of a quote, I should say from Wang Wenbin China's foreign ministry spokesperson who said, \"We urge the U.S. government to abandon the Cold War mentality and ideological basis, look at the bilateral relations correctly and stop its negative behaviors and create favorable conditions for bringing relations back on track.\" So, where are we now and what do you see in all of this, sir? MICHAEL PILLSBURY, DIRECTOR, CENTER ON CHINESE STRATEGY, HUDSON INSTITUTE: Well, the Chinese continued to deny anything wrong on their side and they deny the technology and deny mistreatment of Uyghurs. I saw a clip with the Chinese ambassador in London a few days ago saying the Uyghurs are very happy in Xinjiang in the reeducation camps. So, this is a phase we're in right now -- (CROSSTALK) MACCALLUM: (Inaudible) there. PILLSBURY: -- where President Trump and Secretary Pompeo are raising the pressure on China, but they are still not making significant concessions at all, Martha. So, things are going to get grimmer would be my forecast. MACCALLUM: So, I asked Secretary Pompeo if we're in a Cold War with China last night and he didn't choose to answer that directly. Do you believe that we are in a Cold War with China now? Closing embassies is typically one of the first stages of that. PILLSBURY: We're surely headed toward a Cold War. The Cold War term for those of us who lived through it had a nuclear dimension and a lot of nightmares like the Cuban missile crisis, military crises after military crises. It had period of detente. So, you had the Eisenhower spirit in Geneva, you had Jimmy Carter trying things differently. So, a Cold War doesn't mean really wide. It's just friction and tension. We're certainly in that situation now where Xi Jinping just doesn't seem to get the idea of the seriousness of the pressure. I might say, Martha, it's bipartisan. Joe Biden has some experience in China, has got some very hawkish advisors around him. Nancy Pelosi used to be the strongest person on human rights and civil rights in China and especially the Dalai Lama. So, there may be a temporary competition going on over the next few months of who can be tougher on China, the Biden camp or President Trump. I just point I put my money on President Trump -- (CROSSTALK) MACCALLUM: You say -- PILLSBURY: -- after the speech last night. MACCALLUM: You say that this is a new area for the president in terms of the political pressure versus the trade pressure. PILLSBURY: Yes. Yes. It's one thing to get concessions on trade. And I really admire the phase one trade deal, 95 pages, enforcement mechanism all kinds of details. That was got the hard way with terrorists. Chinese understood it and the tariffs are still on and that's a good deal the president got even though he says he's not too interested anymore. This other area, politics, democracy, human rights, there are violations at the Indian border like that, much harder to put pressure on. MACCALLUM: Dr. Michael Pillsbury, always good to see you, sir. The Story is not going anywhere. We'll talk more -- we'll talk more soon. Thank you, sir. Coming up, a Princeton University professor taking various heat for rejecting a letter that was signed by 350 of his colleagues that would base compensation at Princeton University and benefits in part based on skin color. He felt that was wrong. We're going to speak to Dr. Joshua Katz exclusively, next. And Victor Davis Hanson with his thoughts after that. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) MACCALLUM: A Princeton professor facing the wrath of his colleagues and students and the university president for refusing to sign on to a faculty letter signed by 350 members that called for radical changes to counter anti-black racism. The letter called for differing compensation levels according to race. It also called for course relief, summer salary, and one additional semester of sabbatical. It said that they should reward the invisible work done by faculty of color with course relief and summer salary, also called for additional human resources for faculty of color. So, in objection, Princeton professor Joshua Katz wrote a public Deliration of Independence right around the Fourth of July in part, writing this in part. It boggles my mind that anybody would advocate giving people extraordinarily privileged people already, let me point out, Princeton professors extra perks for no reason other than their pigmentation. Dr. Joshua Katz joins me now, professor of classics at Princeton University. Good to have you with us, Dr. Katz. Thank you for being here. So, you know, you read this document that that goes through these additional things that they wanted to give people almost as a form of -- almost as a form of reparation of, you know, sort of, way to compensate people. So, what disturbs you, what irk you so much that you decided that you were going to speak out? JOSHUA KATZ, PROFESSOR OF CLASSICS, PRINCETON UNIVERSITY: Well, I think every reasonable person of goodwill wants the world to be as just as equitable as possible. And I wrote my piece out of the conviction that my colleagues, the many colleagues who had drafted and signed this faculty letter dated July 4th seek equity and justice in misguided in ways, indeed in some ways that are illegal. So, the points that you just mentioned, for example, I said I thought were really very bad but I should have made the point much more strongly. They're in violation of title six of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. So, if you want to implement them, at least at the moment, Princeton would receive no federal funding at all. That would be very bad news. MACCALLUM: I mean, you make very -- very solid points. So why do you think there is so much support for this among all of your colleagues? Why do you think so many people decided to sign this when as you point out it clearly goes against some of the foundations of our country? And the Constitution. KATZ: Well, in my -- sure. So in my -- in my simple Declaration of Independence, I think just a bit, there were four possible reasons people might have signed, and I concentrated principally on the one that I still now some weeks later believe also on the basis of things colleagues have told me is the main one. Mainly that colleagues believe that some of the ideas in the letter are good and so therefore decided to sign on as one might call allies and not worry about the other ones. There are plenty of things in the letter that I agree with or at least believe more reasonable myself, but there are enough. MACCALLUM: Yes. KATZ: In fact, more than enough that I thought it was a mistake to sign. MACCALLUM: Yes. They talk about forming a committee that would basically decide, you know, who was racist and who isn't and what racist language, what is -- what connotes racist language. But one of the things that really got people fired up in your letter is this mention of the black justice league which you write was active on campus from 2014 to 2016 and you call it a small local terrorist organization that made life miserable for the many including many black students who did not agree with their demands. And boy, do they come at you for this from your own classics department. They said that you had heedlessly put our black colleagues, students, and alums at serious risks. Tell me about that. KATZ: Yes. Right. Well, let me start from the end. So, it's true that I'm receiving an enormous amount of heat from my own department and we're going to have to see how that plays out. The fact is however, that I have not been canceled the university has admitted that thanks to the so-called University of Chicago principles of free speech that the faculty adopted formally in 2015 I am allowed to say pretty much what I want. And so, by the way, as the president and so at least on non-departmental pages or my colleagues. So, I haven't been canceled, I have survived and that's a good reason for places that don't have the University of Chicago principles to adopt them. As for the phrase terrorist organization, I have tried to justify it. I believe I was justified in using the phrase. I understand that some people feel that I was unjustified in using the phrase. This to me is not a remarkable disagreement. People have disagreements like this all the time. The important point here is that people are focusing on this one phrase or that one paragraph and ignoring all of the demands in the letter and the things that I said about the other things. It's not that I'm not willing to defend this point, but they're seizing on -- MACCALLUM: Right. KATZ: -- a piece of rhetoric and ignoring all of the very, very large issues which I don't believe should be ignored. I don't think they think should be ignored either. MACCALLUM: Well, we're glad that you haven't been canceled for the basic fact that you should have the right to express your opinion and not be afraid or feel that it's not an environment where you can express your opinion and lay out your own arguments because that's what should be happening at universities across this country in a fair and honest exchange. So, we thank you, Dr. Katz for being here tonight. KATZ: Thank you very much for having me, Martha. MACCALLUM: So, let's bring in Victor Davis Hanson, senior fellow at Stanford University's Hoover Institution and the author of \"The Case for Trump.\" Victor, you've heard this discussion, and I know you've read about Dr. Katz's situation. What do you think first of all of the demands that this Princeton faculty made in the first place to treat people differently based on the color of their skin? VICTOR DAVIS HANSON, SENIOR FELLOW, HOOVER INSTITUTE: Well, as Professor Kat said, they're illegal, you can't let a university on Orwellian principles like that. But it's a good -- it's a good example. If one -- one person and Professor Katz is a world-renowned linguist and comparative philologist. But if one person speaks out, look who he was speaking out against, Martha. The president of Princeton University is a constitutional scholar. Classics department is supposed to be devotees of Socratic proof and constitutional history and (Inaudible) and Aristotle. And they were on the wrong side morally and on the wrong side of history, much less Princeton University itself. But he spoke out and what happened? It dissolved. And that's what we are seeing now we're are reaching peak Jacobinism. And by that, I mean, that Professor Pinker of Harvard spoke out. The Wall Street Journal just recently said we are not going to involve ourselves in this ridiculous cancel culture. Then we had Bari Weiss at the New York Times, the Harper's letter, Goya failed boycott. We had A&E losing half of its audience because one show was canceled. I think what we're seeing is that we are reaching the peak of this and it sort of a bluster and it's like a big helium balloon that it takes one fair-minded brave scholar like Professor Pinker or Professor Katz to put a hole in it and remind everybody that this is sort of like the Salem witch trials or the 1793 reign of terror in France. That it's some period of mass insanity and mass hysteria and if you stand up to it, it will pass and restore, you know, restore calm and sanity of the country. But you have to stand up to it. If you don't, and you grabble and you apologize you just feed this monster. MACCALLUM: Great point as always. And you know, you have to feel bad for the people who get caught up in that peak moment -- HANSON: Yes. MACCALLUM: -- because usually cooler heads eventually prevail. And I think all the examples that you gave -- HANSON: They do. MACCALLUM: -- are a point to the fact that that's starting to happen. Victor Davis Hanson, sir, always good to see you. Thank you so much. So, days after the NBA unveiled black lives matter on their basketball courts, professional baseball players last night got back to the game and they kneeled in support of the movement as well, praise -- raising the debate about whether political statement are appropriate and are fair game in sports. Jack Brewer when The Story continues. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) MACCALLUM: As professional sports begin again and hurray for that on this Friday evening, many leagues and teams are out with the bolden brace of the Black Lives Matter movement as they get back on the field in the court. The NBA this week made a statement on its games court -- on its game court and then at the home opener Thursday night of the Yankees and the Nationals players took a knee in tribute to the Black Lives Matter movement. Similar gestures took place at the Giants and Dodgers game except for one player which got a lot of attention. San Francisco Giants pitcher, Sam Coonrod refused to kneel and he said this was why. He says I'm a Christian. I can't kneel before anything besides God. I can't get on board with a couple of things that I've read about Black Lives Matter. How they leaned towards Marxism and they've said some negative things about the nuclear family. I just can get on board with that. That from the Giants pitcher. Joining me now is Jack Brewer, a former professional football player and CEO of the Brewer Group. Jack, always good to have you with us. Thanks for joining us tonight. JACK BREWER, CEO, THE BREWER GROUP INC.: Good to be back. MACCALLUM: So, what goes through your mind as you see these symbols on the NBA court and then also the long line, I mean, I remember when this kneeling action started it was Colin Kaepernick alone. But now it will be probably close to everyone I would imagine. BREWER: It really is, you know, for me, I get saddened when I see it. I see, you know, a culture that's kneeling down for black lives matter when their doctrine is antifamily. Their doctrine is antichrist. This is an antichrist movement. If you look, you know, they are promoting our sexual morality issues that go completely against the bible. It's like and these folks are kneeling to this movement and not kneeling for God. You know, you remove God from every portion of our society. And it's time for athletes to start stepping up for religion and for our religious freedoms and the things that are really affecting our communities. You know, we have a spiritual war going on in our country and for Black Lives Matter to hijack that word. Black Lives Matter, yes, they should matter to everybody. But the actual organization is representing the things that are across our society, antifamily, when fatherlessness is running rapid in our country and the people that we see in our streets, the folks that are locked up. You are six times more likely to live in poverty if you don't have a father. You're 20 times more likely to go to prison if you don't have a father. The same people that are having the run-ins with the law enforcement officers are fatherless. And this, this organization, Black Lives Matter in their doctrine in their mission statement says they are against the patriarch system. The bible calls for patriarchy. The bible calls for us to have sexual morality not sexual immorality. This has to end and it's time for athletes across America to stand up for what's right, what's right in the word of God and stop letting this shame, the shaming and this cancel culture completely destroy our nation. Enough is enough. Our kids are dying in the streets every weekend. MACCALLUM: I can't imagine anyone could say it better than you just did and it would be so great to see a lot more activism aimed at what you're talking about in terms of keeping families together and the importance of fathers and what a difference they make in the success ability for the kids educationally and in life. This is Lou Holtz. I spoke with him for my podcast. Just listen to what he said when I asked him about this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LOU HOLTZ, FORMER COLLEGE FOOTBALL COACH: When I look at the sporting event I looked to be entertained and I look at competitiveness and not to get a political message or something else. Don't tell me what I should believe, how I should say, et cetera. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: I mean, it is. It's divisive if you look at that picture standing there, so it, you know, forces this conversation between players in the place where it would be kind of nice to leave all of that aside, I think everybody needs a little bit of an escape from everything that's going on right now. BREWER: Yes, you're so right. I mean, think about sports should be reuniting us. And now you're seeing it divide our nation. And it's just not right. MACCALLUM: Yes. BREWER: Major League Baseball is America's game and we got to get back to that unity one blood, one nation in Jesus Christ's name. MACCALLUM: All right. Jack, I got to jump in, we're going to get off. Thank you very much, Jack Brewer. We're going to be right -- (COMMERCIAL BREAK) MACCALLUM: That is The Story of Friday, July 24th, 2020.

He shouldn\u2019t make a major concession like this on illegal immigration without getting something important from Democrats in return.The president told Telemundo anchor Jose Diaz-Balart that in the next few weeks \u201cI\u2019m going to do a big executive order, I have the power to do it as president and I\u2019m going to make  a big part of it.\u201dDACA stands for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals. The program was created by President Barack Obama under an executive order in 2012. According to the Department of Homeland Security there are now about 643,000 DACA recipients in the U.S.Many DACA recipients are now young adults and have spent most of their lives in the U.S. Under DACA, they remain here legally. But an end to the program could make them eligible for deportation to their native countries, or simply keep them in the shadows if they remain in the U.S.When he campaigned for president in 2015, Trump correctly labeled Obama\u2019s decree as being illegal. He tried to end DACA, but the Supreme Court earlier this month gave the Obama order a reprieve in a 5-4 ruling that speciously claimed that the Trump\u2019s legal papers lacked a sufficient explanation for a reversal of the Obama executive order. That means Trump could try again to end DACA.For Trump to do an about-face now and give DACA recipients what he called \u201ca road to citizenship\u201d would be a huge blow to his base and a major policy mistake if he does so without getting significant concessions in return from the open-borders crowd.In 2016, many voters were turned off by candidate Trump\u2019s acerbic style, but they voted for him anyway because of his policy positions \u2014 including getting tough on illegal immigration \u2014\u00a0 and because he was perceived to be a practical businessman and a tough negotiator.Indeed, the president negotiated some commendable deals, including the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement to replace the North American Free Trade Agreement, along with a promising trade deal with China prior to the coronavirus pandemic.So why would Trump simply cave to the Democrats on DACA without requiring them to give something on their end?While it\u2019s true that even Republicans have a soft spot for people who were brought here illegally as children by their parents through no fault of their own, millions of Americans still want to see a more comprehensive package that would include some of the following:that have popped up throughout Democratic strongholds across the nation. which would impose a mandatory five-year prison sentence for deported criminal illegal immigrants who try to reenter the U.S.to reduce the flow of illegal immigrants \u2014 including criminals \u2014 and drugs into the U.S. from Mexico. by businesses to ensure that they are not employing illegal immigrants who forge paperwork. that allow hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants to gain entry into the U.S. by falsely claiming they face persecution in their home countries. that has incentivized Central American parents to pay dangerous coyotes who are members of criminal cartels to transport their children over the U.S. southern border. which allows one person gaining authorized access into America to bring in his or her entire extended family.The president's comment about a pathway to citizenship for DACA recipients smells of election-year desperation. It looks as though he is sweating the fact that his approval rating has dipped below 40 percent in polls and he is behind in most of the swing states he won four years agoBut Trump shouldn\u2019t think for a second that granting this amnesty is going to get him additional votes.It\u2019s one thing to grant protection from deportation, but it\u2019s quite another to take the next step and provide citizenship. Such action would almost guarantee Republicans being shut out of the White House for a generation.This is another example of Republicans seeking short-term gain at the expense of long-term security. It's what we saw when corporate America sold out the long-term interest of America's middle class for short-term profits in moving jobs to China. It\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing today as corporate America sells out to the radical and intolerant left in the support of boycotting other businesses.These short-term ploys wind up being a form of political suicide. That's exactly what granting citizenship to illegal immigrants would be for Republicans who ignore the views of their base.One of President Ronald Reagan\u2018s biggest mistakes was signing the 1986 Amnesty Act for illegal immigrants. It was supposed to be the last amnesty we ever had. All it did was send a message that it paid to come here illegally, rather than waiting in line.As a result, another 20 million individuals did just that over the next 35 years. In the meantime, the millions of people around the world patiently waiting their turn to get into America the right way have become the biggest suckers on the planet.There surely are a number of Republican strategists figuring that an election victory by former Vice President Joe Biden is going to give citizenship to illegal immigrants anyway. So why not just do it now, with the hope of siphoning some votes from Democrat Biden?But that\u2019s not why Americans \u2013 Republicans, independents and even some conservative Democrats \u2013 elected Trump. They wanted a fighter, not someone who was going to cave in for political expediency when things got rough.The only chance America has of stemming the tide of illegal immigration is a Trump win in November and the leverage that it would provide to get the concessions from open-border Democratic politicians.What\u2019s the point of voting for Trump if he\u2019s going to make a major concession to Democrats on illegal immigration and get absolutely nothing in return?It\u2019s ironic that this last-minute Hail Mary attempt by the Trump campaign appears to be a sudden effort to court independents. Many of us have been asking Trump to seek support from independents for the last four years.But in truth, a major reason the president has lost independents \u2014 and particularly college-educated suburban women \u2014 is because of his insulting tweets, harsh rhetoric and overly combative style.A much better way to please independents is to stop tweeting about the Confederate flag, and about monuments and military bases named for Confederate generals who waged war against the United States to preserve slavery.Trump can also gain support by exhibiting some empathy and sounding less obsessed about minor controversies, such as the recent flare-up over NASCAR driver Bubba Wallace.But the president should not cave on illegal immigration \u2013 one of the core policy issues that first attracted disaffected voters to the Trump campaign.", "comment": "(1,724)", "topic": "OPINION", "date": " July 12"}, {"cover": "https://a57.foxnews.com/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/694940094001/225a9503-861d-4167-abbe-ddfe0c0b427d/bf1ba007-810c-454e-9bf2-6cc9e051a25c/1280x720/match/156/88/image.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "title": "Tucker Carlson: Political violence is an attack on America itself", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/political-violence-is-an-attack-on-america-itself-tucker-carlson", "subtitle": "Violence returns us to the most primitive of all systems, one in which might makes right.

For generations, what shocked the people in charge of this country was political , hurting your neighbors for having different opinions. They were appalled by that and they were right to be.Political violence isn't simply an assault on individual Americans, it's an attack on America itself. In this country, we govern by consent, not by force. People with guns don't make our , voters do.You may have a Glock in your hand, but on , you have precisely as many votes as the little old lady who disagrees with you. That's our system. The weak are supposed to have as much power over the government as the strong, and that is the basis of our equality as Americans, something that we should cherish and protect.Political violence immediately short circuits this. It ends democracy. Violence instead returns us to the most primitive of all systems, one in which might makes right. People who hurt others get to do exactly what they want. Everyone else has to obey them. There is no greater threat to civilization than this and we used to understand that because it's obvious.But things have changed. The people who run this country are no longer shocked by political violence. They welcome it. They slyly encourage it. They are its beneficiaries.They tell us the only real crimes are thought crimes. It's okay to set fires or smash strangers in the face with two by fours, so long as you are chanting the correct slogans. If you're on the right team, everything is allowed.But if you dare to dissent from the orthodoxy, you will be swiftly punished. Go ahead and express the wrong opinion. Try it in a meeting, try it on Facebook, they will find you. You will lose your job, your reputation, possibly even your life.The message they're sending you is very clear. Americans are not equal anymore. There are two standards in this country, one standard for them and a very different standard for you.Over the weekend, we saw exactly what they will excuse from their own supporters. Armed mobs of Joe Biden voters torched, buildings, smashed cars, attacked police officers. They rioted. They hurt people, a lot of people -- and the media, watching closely lied about all of it. They pretended it didn't happen. They made excuses for it. They buried the truth in euphemism.The liars of \"The New York Times\" described the riots as quote, \"protests,\" as if the violence was justified or could be justified. Here's the truth about what happened. Here's what actually happened in Seattle over the weekend. Take a look.[VIDEO CLIP PLAYS SHOWING VIOLENCE]CARLSON: Protests? No, these were not protests. These were scenes from a war. The rioters threw rocks, bottles, wood, explosives at police. One explosion left an eight inch hole in a police precinct.Because no lie is too absurd for CNN to tell, the network described violence against police as quote, \"a demonstration against police violence.\" Got that? It's a perfect inversion of the truth worthy of 1984. Ignorance is strength. Freedom is slavery. War is peace.They repeat it because they expect you to believe it and no doubt some do.Meanwhile, Seattle Police Department gamely tried to push back by releasing actual body cam footage of the violence. It is not clear how many people saw it. So, we're going to show some of you -- we're going to show some of it to you right here.[VIDEO CLIP PLAYS OF BODY CAM FOOTAGE]CARLSON: A total of 59 police officers were injured in this demonstration against police violence. CNN would like you to believe they attacked themselves, they did not, not in Seattle, not anywhere.In Oakland, the mobs with helmets and shields attacked a police station. They shot cops with fireworks. They set fire to a courthouse. Here are pictures of it.[VIDEO CLIP PLAYS SHOWING RIOTERS SETTING FIRE TO COURTHOUSE]CARLSON: According to NBC News, the rioters you just saw were quote, \"protesters.\" They burned the courthouse quote, \"after a peaceful demonstration intensified.\" Oh intensified, just like the World Trade Center collapsed when a commercial airline flight intensified.It's remarkable. You've got to believe there are still normal people working at ABC News, maybe in the tape library or in the cafeteria. Are they watching their own coverage? How can they stand it? The apologies for violence, the relentless shameless lying?It's hard to believe they haven't resigned. They probably have mortgages and kids who feel for them. Just as you feel for the cameraman who would flee the mob in Sacramento over the weekend.They were surrounded and apparently assaulted by 150 Joe Biden voters dressed in black paramilitary gear, and had to run for their lives. You'd think other journalists would be sympathetic to this, they used to be? Not anymore.The stakes are too high. We've got an election coming up and so instead they lie to provide cover for the rioters, the ones who threatened the cameraman.The \"Sacramento Bee\" took pains to tell you that the protests are actually peaceful. The newspaper did its best to downplay the violence, including the fact that so-called protesters are trying to disarm police helicopters with laser pointers.One of the peaceful protesters ran through the streets with a chainsaw in order to block traffic, no problem. Nothing to see here.Meanwhile, at mostly peaceful protests in Austin and Aurora, Colo., people were shot. In downtown Louisville, heavily armed militia and military outfits walked through the city threatening violence if police officers weren't sent to jail. No problem, just a protest. In Milwaukee, a Black Trump supporter named Bernell Trammell was executed in front of his office in broad daylight. He was killed.In Portland, Ore., police seized a bag filled with rifle magazines and Molotov cocktails, not a big deal.City leaders in Portland have ignored 60 straight days of rioting. It's fine, they say. Really? Here is how Portland looked over the weekend.[VIDEO CLIP PLAYS SHOWING VIOLENCE IN PORTLAND]CARLSON: This isn't fine. It's not normal. It's not a protest. These aren't children. These are adults, and they're destroying our country. They're completely out of control. They're violent.Are they punished? No. Where's the Justice Department in this? Don't we have an Attorney General? Isn't he supposed to be conservative? Why are we allowing this?Chad Wolf runs the Department of Homeland Security. Wolf, whatever you think of him has been one of the very few officials in Washington, who seems to notice that any of this is happening. He sent Federal law enforcement to Portland to keep the mob from burning down the Federal Courthouse there, which the mob does not own. It is Federal property. They have no right to torch it. It's not theirs. It's ours.For doing that, for being one of the very few to actually push back a little bit, he was punished. The mob came to Chad Wolf's home yesterday, and they threatened him and his family and they didn't do it suddenly. It wasn't subtext. They said it out loud on camera. Watch.CARLSON: Oh, she is trying to figure out why the Department of Justice isn't actually doing anything? Why they haven't frog marched the leaders of Antifa in front of the camera? Why they haven't stopped this stuff? While they're acting like they're powerless?Maybe they don't want mobs like this in front of their houses. Maybe mob violence works. \"We must make it uncomfortable for them,\" she says in a megaphone. What does that mean? Well, we don't need to guess because we just spent all weekend watching what it means.Here's the contrast that we should never forget. Things change so quickly. You imagine things have always been this way, but they haven't.There's a presidential election a few months from now. If you disagree with what Chad Wolf has done, you get to vote against Chad Wolf's boss, and Chad Wolf will be out of a job. That's the way we used to do it, when this was a democracy. But not anymore. Now they just go and threaten Chad Wolf's children and the media applaud.Last month, a radio show host in Seattle called Paul Gallant mocked reports that his city was descending into chaos. These were peaceful protests, he suggested. On Twitter, Gallant reported that he saw, quote, \"no burning, pillaging or deaths.\" Of course those things were happening. They existed. We showed you tape of it at the time.But Gallant pretended otherwise. We don't know why we'd have to assume because he thought it would help his team. Then the rioters showed up in the building where he lives, in his apartment building and they destroyed the Starbucks downstairs and that scared him.Now, Gallant says he is buying a gun.

I'm Laura Ingraham. This is the \"The Ingraham Angle\" from Washington tonight. Teachers unions are choosing liberal wish lists over educating your kids. Can't be. Well, we'll explain.Also, Donald Trump's niece just published a totally slanderous work impugning the President's psyche, defamatory since it's in writing. A psychologist is here tonight to detail how Mary Trump is guilty of some pretty obvious projection. And a potential scandal is brewing with the counting of positive tests in Florida for COVID, a full report. Plus, we're going to hear from a respected doctor down there with the actual facts.But first, the war against kids. That's the focus of tonight's Angle.Is there anything in the world happening beyond COVID? Well, you'd think not, watching the non-stop fear and panic sold by the media and their Democrat partners 24/7.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: America is the worldwide epicenter for new cases in large part due to Trump's failure.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: --no end in sight. The point is, there is no plan. There is no federal--ANDERSON COOPER, CNN ANCHOR: yes.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: --led effort to bring this back.UNIDENTIFIED MALE (voice-over): What, if anything, can be done to pull the country out of this public health disaster?(END VIDEO CLIP) \u00a0INGRAHAM: Well, they rarely report, of course, that new infections haven't translated into a rising COVID death rate. In fact, the seven-day average COVID deaths has fallen from a peak of 2,232 in mid-April to 724 as of yesterday. That's right. It's a 68 percent decline.Now, there has been a slight uptick in COVID deaths this month, but the death rate is nowhere near where it was back in April. So that's good news in a difficult situation. But they don't just want you living in fear. What they want you to be is demoralized, dumb down, and dependent on the government. Meaning, more PPP, mailbox money instead of actual jobs, and they hope that you're going to be so exhausted from riding this lockdown and reopening roller coaster that you'll trade freedom for a false sense of security. And then it will be on to socialism.Now, in case you've forgotten, freedom includes the right to travel, to gather, to work, to worship, and to attend school. And it is this issue of school reopening where we see exactly what Joe Biden's puppeteers are capable of.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SUSAN RICE, FORMER NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR: We cannot do as the President Trump is doing and play politics with and be willing to sacrifice the lives of our children and their teachers.(END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Let me say this very clearly. They're lying to you when they say it's too dangerous to reopen schools. A new German study, the largest of its kind, confirms what we had learned from Iceland, France, and Scandinavian countries. Now, \"The results show that 'the dynamics of virus spreading have been overestimated,' the universities said\" - that did the study - \"adding that the study suggested that schools did not become the coronavirus hotspot after reopening, as had been feared.\"Now, in case you think this is some small, ridiculous study, a total of 2,045 blood samples from schoolchildren and teachers were taken from 13 secondary schools in Germany. Unlike the U.S., European countries smartly sent their students back to school, and there haven't been any major outbreaks.So, should kids wear masks and social distance in schools? Well, different countries have tried different approaches. It's been different all across the globe. But school districts across America are right now planning very expensive classroom modifications. You've seen a lot of the Plexiglas dividers. Maybe they work, maybe they don't. And parents, in turn, are buying into this freak-out. And in Orange County, where they're bucking the trend in California, some parents are actually upset about the reopening.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: There are so many people who can get sick. And I think it's very dangerous and unacceptable to go back to school right now.CHORUS: Kids' lives matter. Kids' lives matter. Kids' lives matter. Where's your mask? Where's our mask?(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM: OK. They don't know about the science. And the media isn't reporting the science. Very interesting. Don't you think?And oddly, Dr. Fauci isn't talking about that science published by German researchers that we just talked about. Professor Reinhard Berner discovered, quote, \"The majority of schoolchildren did not go through an infection themselves despite an infection in the household. This finding must also be taken into account when it comes to deciding on measures to limit contact.\"Now, if you listen closely to physicians, even far-left outlets like MSNBC occasionally stumble upon the truth. But boy, are they embarrassed by it! \u00a0(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) \u00a0UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Would you let your kids go back to school?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I will. My kids are looking forward to it.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes. Period. Absolutely.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Absolutely. As much as I can.(LAUGHTER) \u00a0UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Without a hesitation?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Without a hesitation, yes.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I have no concerns about sending my child to school in the fall.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I would let my kids go back to school.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Dr. John Torres, NBC News.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: They all said yes.(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM: OK. That's my favorite moment of the day. They ran out of teachers, OK? Or parents or reporters or experts or doctors. But of course, Biden's big allies, the teachers unions, they pay no attention to the doctors or that extensive German study I just talked about. They want their members to stay home and totally ignore what we know about kids' exceedingly low infectivity rates. They ignore the horrific mental and physical health consequences from keeping kids away from school as well.We said this last night. I'm going to repeat it. It's really important. These teachers, just like police and firefighters, they are essential employees. Their salaries are paid by you, the taxpayers. Yet, many are basically refusing to return to work. Now, this is not to say that there are no risks of returning to schools. There are. There may be.The CDC issued its final flu report for the 2019-2020 season. Tragically, 166 children died of the flu nationwide. But schools didn't close, did they? Teachers did not refuse to work. By contrast, the number of children who've died nationwide of COVID is 30 according to provisional CDC data. Now, every life lost is a horrific tragedy. That goes without saying.Now, in California, where teachers unions are pushing to keep your kids at home, guess how many of the state's nearly 9 million schoolchildren have succumbed to COVID. Do you see it in the screen? Zero. That's right. No one under the age of 18 has died from COVID in California according to the stats that we have, the most up-to-date ones.So, thankfully, overwhelmingly, children have been spared. Still, Biden's most ardent supporters, the teachers unions are ratcheting up the fear. And they're even trying to extort concessions that have zero to do with education. The United Teachers Los Angeles Union is demanding the abolishment of charter schools and demanding the defunding of police. Yes, that will keep those kids safe and educated. We'll have more on that in a bit.But here's the bottom line. Schools are where children learn, grow, interact, have fun. It's where they run around, they play sports, and yes, sometimes they get hurt. For some, it's a respite from a turbulent home life. They desperately need this rhythm of school back, this normalcy to return.And economically, our country cannot survive school closures without cataclysmic ripple effects. Parents will suddenly be out of work, and job losses in the education arena will be severe. Children can't be pawns this campaign season. We have to safeguard their physical health but also their long-term development. Keeping them locked in the house attached to screens is going to lead to untold suffering, a toll for them far worse than this virus.And that's The Angle.Joining me now is Georgianna Kelman, L.A. parent and special education attorney; also, Harmeet Dhillon, civil rights attorney and Founder of the Center for American Liberty that is challenging so many of these edicts across the country.Georgianna, let's start with you. You're in the middle of this.GEORGIANNA KELMAN, L.A. SPECIAL EDUCATION ATTORNEY & LOS ANGELES PARENT: I am.INGRAHAM: What's your reaction to the L.A. Unified School District's decision not to reopen this fall for in-class learning?KELMAN: It's a huge, massive mistake that we're going to be paying for, for a long time. And thank you for everything you said because you've articulated everything I wanted to say perfectly. The UTLA (inaudible). I can't tell you how many times called me consistently - teachers called me consistently to tell me they want schools opened.(inaudible) there is the survey that was done for parents and the majority of LAUSD parents want to go back to school. Teachers want to go back to school, but unfortunately, this union is a bully. Teachers are being highly encouraged to vote along with the safe line of thinking that the union - based on their objectives of the union.And I'm here to tell you that it's not true, that the majority of Los Angeles parents want to go back to school. Unfortunately, they don't have a seat at the table. Kids don't have lobbyists. Kids don't have unions speaking on their behalves and speaking the truth. And we're not having a conversation about truly the impact of COVID versus closure.I think the long-term, kids are going to be much more detrimentally impacted, most especially special education children and children in low- income communities due to this closure. I do believe there's an answer. I do believe there's a middle ground that is a hybrid system that can--INGRAHAM: Yes. Yes.KELMAN: --can be implemented, but it's the union that's preventing it.INGRAHAM: Well, I would argue that I'm going to go even further, Harmeet. I think the hybrid system is - it's probably a little bit better, but it's incredibly confusing and upends family life, obviously for working parents, especially.Harmeet, Eric Garcetti, the Mayor of Los Angeles - and it dovetails into this conversation - is already threatening another lockdown. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Do you want to initiate (ph) the mandate on stay-at-home order to return?MAYOR ERIC GARCETTI, D-LOS ANGELES: So - we had a safer-at-home order. As I said even then, not everything was always closed, but yes, if we go to red, that's what we will come. I don't - today - I only know today. Ask me tomorrow. Ask me later this week. But I want everybody to take seriously that we're on the verge of that for sure.(END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Harmeet, is this the MO now every time China releases a virus accidentally? Or people are worried about, I don't know what next, climate change, we're going to do shutdown for a while to save the - I don't know. Is this just what we're going to do forever if the Democrats are in charge?HARMEET DHILLON, CIVIL RIGHTS ATTORNEY: Well, absolutely, Laura. I think that's their MO. By the way, one of the examples would be, is there an election this year. That would be a good reason to terrorize people and shut them down.So Eric Garcetti is speaking the message of his owners and the owners of the Democratic Party in California, which is the California Teachers Union. By far, the most powerful lobbyist, their demands to open the schools in any fashion, even the bastardized hybrid fashion that you just mentioned, Laura, includes Medicare for all, defunding the police, and on and on and on. All kinds of goodies that have nothing to do with educating our children.And Laura, even before this crisis, California was already in a dismal state with regard to literacy. Fewer than 25 percent of our fourth-graders can read properly. And they just settled a suit with the state between literacy activists and the state this year because of the equal protection violations, the fact that students in poor school districts or people of disadvantaged backgrounds--INGRAHAM: Right.DHILLON: --or people from certain English as a second language, what have you, are not getting educated. That's before COVID. Imagine what it's going to be like when they don't have individualized attention, when their individual education plans are not being honored by the state. This is going to cause massive physical harm to students. Schools are the only resort for many families with--INGRAHAM: All right.DHILLON: --with students who may be suffering from different things that are only perceived when they come to school, Laura.INGRAHAM: Well, I'm going to stay on this issue. I think it's the issue affecting all families with children for the foreseeable future. This is the most important issue.Ladies, thank you so much.And as I mentioned earlier, the L.A. teachers union - and Harmeet said - they're making these crisis demands. It's like an ongoing - we're watching it in real-time - attempt at extortion. We won't educate your kids in person unless you give us certain liberal projects like defunding the police. Now, a moratorium on new charter schools can have competition and taxpayer handouts to illegals because we have to welcome more people into the country even though we can't educate the kids that we have.Now, these are runaway unions that are exploiting this tragedy, and they want to see how much power they can grab. Like everybody else knocking down statues, they want to knock down education to try to get more concessions.Joining me now is Rebecca Friedrichs, former California schoolteacher and a union rep. She was also the lead plaintiff in that landmark 2016 Supreme Court case against CNA, NEA and California Teachers Association.Rebecca, I didn't think much of the teachers unions before COVID. And now, I'm frankly disgusted because it's obvious they're putting students last and teachers' union political demands first. Your take?REBECCA FRIEDRICHS, FORMER CA TEACHER FOR 25+ YEARS: I am so thrilled that you feel that way and that you are highlighting this for your viewers. I have been shouting about this for decades. So it is very important that we open our schools. That is true.The unions are using the closure of our schools as a smokescreen. Laura, here's why. Sadly, these unions are actually using our schools to sexualize our children and to train them in anti-American ideology. They do this with the collision of over 180 organizations, including, sadly, the CDC, Planned Parenthood, and Black Lives Matter incorporated.It is shocking what they're teaching our children online through virtual learning. They are teaching our children to sext to view pornography. They are hooking them up with online sex experts. So what they are doing is grooming our children for sexual predators to use them. This is child abuse.I have an editorial about this tomorrow online in \"The Washington Times\". People can read and learn all the details. This is one of the big reasons the unions want to keep our schools closed because they can't sneak these evil lessons past loving teachers who have no idea of keeping them virtual.INGRAHAM: All right. Yes. Rebecca, I remember, a friend of mine living up north of L.A., in the Santa Barbara area, was telling me about the kindergarten living, whatever it's called, human life curriculum. And I know it's repeated throughout other school districts in California. It's way advanced for a kindergartner. And most parents don't even - I don't think - know about it to opt out. And there's a big controversy about whether the kids could opt out or - or they have to opt out or it's automatically happen. So that's the kind of stuff that goes on.And your point is an important one. The unions would rather have teachers at home using these online tools because it's a lot more complicated when you're in class trying to teach this stuff. So you think there's actually the political motive to be at home, not just that they're misstating the science or don't know the science?FRIEDRICHS: Oh, absolutely. And what you also have to know is that the teachers unions, the National Education Association rewrote the scientific method so that this is why we are getting fake science, fake history, fake everything through our schools because it is their goal to destroy our public schools.Look, I think that we could - we have this perfect opportunity right now where we can actually save America's schools and we can save America if we do four things. Number one--(CROSSTALK) \u00a0INGRAHAM: We have to go, Rebecca. Got to--FRIEDRICHS: Oh, thanks.INGRAHAM: Well, we've got - no, we have to say thanks. But four things, are those in your op-ed tomorrow?FRIEDRICHS: No, they're not. We'll have to do another one.(LAUGHTER) INGRAHAM: All right. We'll have you - we'll have you back. Sorry, this is the tyranny of the clock and cable news. Rebecca, we got a lot of--FRIEDRICHS: No problem.INGRAHAM: --information out. Thank you so much.There is a potential scandal brewing in Florida over how hospitals are tracking COVID cases. We're going to tell you about it in moments. Plus, later we speak to a psychiatrist who says Mary Trump's new personal attempt at a takedown of President Trump reveals more about her than the President. She'll explain.(COMMERCIAL BREAK) INGRAHAM: The number of COVID cases in Florida is undoubtedly on the rise, but there's a potentially massive scandal-brewing regarding the way hospitals, labs and others are reporting the percentage of positive test results.Fox affiliate WOFL's Robert Guaderrama has been looking into the story, and he joins us now live from Orlando with the latest breaking details.Robert?ROBERT GUADERRAMA, WOFL-FOX ORLANDO REPORTER: Laura, it takes a lot to surprise a journalist, but I was shocked when I heard this news today. So there's lots of confusion on many levels in reference to Florida's coronavirus numbers. We've got tipped off today - or yesterday that is, that the numbers didn't quite look right on the state's daily case report.So, looking into the breakdown of test labs, I quickly noticed astronomical positivity rates. Now, mind you, Florida's COVID-19 positivity rate is just under 11 percent, but dozens of labs reported as having 100 percent positivity. Some only reporting positive cases. The negative column, completely blank.So I asked myself, how could 100 percent of people testing at those sites test positive? I reached out to several major hospitals in our area. Orlando Health and the Orlando VA confirming errors in their numbers on the report.So, after several requests for comment, today the Florida Department of Health releasing this statement to me, reading in part, \"In recent days, the department noticed that some smaller, private labs weren't reporting negative test result data. The department immediately began working with those labs to ensure that all results were being reported in order to provide comprehensive and transparent data.\"Now, these labs are required by the state to report all test results. But here's something else that adds to the confusion. A spokesperson for Lee Memorial Hospital, that's in the Fort Myers area, tells me that they believe there's a problem in the state's data-gathering system because it is their understanding the negative results from their hospital were in fact submitted.So, Laura, more questions to be answered, but this news coming as so many Floridians are already questioning the numbers being reported by the state.INGRAHAM: Robert, fascinating. Thanks for the great job. We appreciate it.And joining us now is Dr. Charles Lockwood, Dean of the University of South Florida's College of Medicine.Dr. Lockwood, now, before we get into the details of Florida's numbers, your reaction to what was just reported? Labs with 100 percent positivity rates and others who aren't reporting any negatives. How damaging is that to the larger picture?DR. CHARLES LOCKWOOD, USF COLLEGE OF MEDICINE DEAN & USF HEALTH SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT: I am - I'm not totally surprised. On Saturday, the state did 143,000 tests when Governor DeSantis said that we were going to triple testing back in March to 30,000 tests a day, which is what the number was that was recommended by the Harvard Global Health Institute for containment. I mean, people literally laughed.And on Saturday, we did 143,000 tests in one day. So that's a lot of tests that you're going to have some screw-ups when you have that volume of testing going on, but that's pretty disturbing.INGRAHAM: Yes. Well, it doesn't inspire a lot of confidence. Dr. Lockwood, I also want to play some of the media coverage of the Sunshine State's COVID outbreak.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) STEVE KORNACKI, MSNBC NATIONAL POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT: Looking at Florida, we have these surging case counts in Florida, the death tolls rising.UNIDENTIFIED MALE (voice-over): The dire situation in the State of Florida- -UNIDENTIFIED MALE (voice-over): In Miami-Dade County, things are especially dire.STATE REP. SHEVRIN JONES, D-FLA.: What we have right now is a total circus of chaos that's taking place in the State of Florida.(END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Of course, there are rising case numbers. They're concerning. But a lot of folks seem to think Florida is the next New York. Now, tell us why that's absurd, frankly.LOCKWOOD: Well, we're not. I mean, it's pretty clear. Just for one thing, our case fatality rate, that's the number of deaths over the number of cases, is 1.5 percent. New York City, right now, it's 10 percent. So that's a huge difference there.We've had a huge increase in cases. We've had a six-fold increase in cases since June 10th. We've had about three-fold increase in hospitalizations. We've had a little less than that increase in deaths where (inaudible) death is tragic. But day-after-day, week-after-week, we've had a continued drop in our case fatality rate.And there are probably three things that directly impact that. One, we're doing lot more testing. We've blown through all the goals that we had. And we're now, on average, doing about 73 tests a day on a rolling average. So that's pretty accurate.INGRAHAM: Now, Vin Gupta, doctor--(CROSSTALK)LOCKWOOD: Secondly--INGRAHAM: Let me just get to - Dr. Lockwood, I want to just play Vin Gupta from NBC News, just to your first point, said that the death rate itself is not really relevant. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DR. VIN GUPTA, MSNBC MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: The death rate, which we make such a big deal out of, the President has a declining death rate is essentially meaningless. Deaths now are probably the result of infections about a month ago. So we can only - the metrics that matter in real-time are what are the hospitalization rates that we're seeing in places like Florida.(END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Well, does he have any merit to what he said?LOCKWOOD: Yes. Well, a little. Deaths are definitely a lagging indicator. But we should now be seeing a much higher case fatality rate. It's been predicted that our case fatality rate would kind of do a \"U\" and be heading back up. It's not. In fact, today, in Tampa, in Hillsborough County, our case fatality rate was 0.9 percent. That's less than 1 percent. So that's the lowest, I think, in the United States.And every day I wake up, I check the numbers, and it's been dropping. Now, I think it's real. And it reflects doing a lot more cases. We're picking up asymptomatic cases, we're picking up milder cases than we did before. When you test that number of people, thousands and thousands, really - I mean, if you think about it, we're testing - we're approaching 1 percent of the population in Florida being tested every day when you get 142,000 tests.INGRAHAM: All right.LOCKWOOD: (inaudible) population--INGRAHAM: Yes. And so the younger the younger population not dying, thankfully, at the rate their elder counterparts were dying earlier. Dr. Lockwood, there's a lot to unpack here. We want to have you back because clearly this Florida narrative is not going away anytime soon. Thank you so much for going through it with us.And the two questions on many Americans minds right now are this. Where is Congress? And what are they going to do about reopening schools? Congressmen Steve Scalise, Jim Jordan - haven't seen them in a while - they are here with some answers. Stay tuned.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)INGRAHAM: Teachers unions are holding our kids' education hostage, and leading Democrats are there coconspirators.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. NANCY PELOSI, D-CALIF., HOUSE SPEAKER: What we heard from the secretary was malfeasance and dereliction of duty. This is appalling. The president and his administration are messing with the health of our children. Going back to school presents the biggest risk for the spread of the coronavirus.(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM: Biggest risk of spread of bull-you-know-what comes from the woman in yellow. How does the House GOP respond to this? Here now is House Minority Whip Steve Scalise and Congressman Jim Jordan, House Oversight Committee ranking member. Great to see both of you. Congressman Scalise, you were at an event about schools in Baton Rouge today with the vice president and many others. What can Congress do about this? This is a local decision-making process, is it not?REP. STEVE SCALISE, R-LA., HOUSE MINORITY WHIP: Yes, Laura, it's good to be back with you. But Vice President Pence came today, we actually did the event in Tiger Stadium. And we had the president of the LSU system, we had the president of the Southern University system. We had our governor, John Bel Edwards, as well as a number of other educators and members of Vice President Pence's team talking about reopening schools. And we're planning on reopening schools in just a few weeks. And both of the system presidents talked about what they are doing to have kids safely come back to college. I was at a high school earlier today talking about their plans to safely reopen.Look, this is America, Laura. We put a man on the moon. We stormed the beaches of Normandy. We know how to get things done. And these people that are sitting in a room going, oh, gee whiz, we can't do it, that's not the attitude we need right now. The real question should be not whether or not to do it, but how to do it safely, and we can do it safely. And I'm glad that states like mine are moving forward. We need to get every state to do it for the health and benefits of these children that don't need another six months of homeschooling.INGRAHAM: Congressman Jordan, earlier tonight we went through some of the science from Germany, which has done serological testing on children and teachers, thousands and thousands of tests. None of this is been cited by any of the decision-makers showing kids have exceedingly low infectivity rates. So those concerns about infecting the teachers -- they haven't seen it in Europe. They just haven't seen it.REP. JIM JORDAN, R-OHIO, HOUSE OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE: No, the facts and the truth are on our side, Laura. Laura, what's more important, going to school or protesting? What's more important, going to church or protesting? Going to a loved one's funeral or protesting? Or how about this one, what's more important, going to work or protesting? It seems to me that the only thing the Democrats think you can do during COVID is protest, riot, and attack the police and defund the police.But all the -- we have to go back to school. We have to get back to normal. And the facts and the truth are on our side. So let's let local school boards, let's let moms and dads -- I think moms and dads probably know what's best for their kids, local school boards probably know better what's better for kids than Joe Biden in the basement of his house pronouncing these things. So let's let local communities decide this. And as Steve just said, we can do it in a safe way. But Democrats want to make everything critical political. Let's just follow the truth and the facts and let's let kids get back to school and start learning.INGRAHAM: There's a lot of -- there's a lot of -- I would take issue with that a little bit. There are a lot of local school boards that have been completely dominated by the left because --JORDAN: The big city ones, the ones controlled by the Democrats, like L.A., like Mayor Garcetti has done, you're right.INGRAHAM: Arlington County, Virginia. It's Democrat, Arlington County, Virginia, they basically just went to a hybrid system, a couple days a week in school, the rest of it they are going to be at home, or maybe even all online learning. Montgomery County, all online learning. Congressman Scalise, I'm telling conservatives, you want to have an effect, start running in these local elections. That's what you have to do, because these superintendents are just taking their orders from the teachers union. These people but the word \"doctor\" in front of their names. Go ahead.SCALISE: And you've got to think about the health and welfare of the kids. The whole purpose of a public school system is to serve the children. And look, it's a cop out to say we can't figure out how to get it done. Of course we can. This is America. And there are good school systems that are figuring out how to do it and are doing it safely.The kids, by the way, they are going to be out playing with their friends. They are going to be doing things. It's much better to have them in a controlled environment in a school where, number one, where they are learning, so we're not holding our kids back. But where they are also being around people where they all have to have masks. The schools have their own protocols, and they're going to keep these kids safe. But we've got to get kids back in school. It's important for the health and welfare of those kids. It's also important for our economy so that the parents are able to get their kids back in school again, too.INGRAHAM: It's almost like there is a concerted effort to tank the economy before the election, the cynics out there would say. Congressman Jordan, it isn't just teachers, though, teachers unions taking advantage of this epidemic. Here is AOC.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. ALEXANDRA OCASIO-CORTEZ, D-N.Y.: Americans have actually gotten even more progressive in the middle of this pandemic. When people say and ask me how are you going to pass this or how are you going to pass that, I tell them we have got to win the Senate and the White House. That is our legislative strategy for getting this stuff passed.(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM: Congressman Scalise, your response?SCALISE: I mean, this is disgusting. All they care about is politics, like Jim said.INGRAHAM: I'm sorry, I'm sorry, Scalise. Let's go to Jordan.SCALISE: Go get them, Jordan.INGRAHAM: Sorry. Sorry.JORDAN: I don't think they're going to win. I think Donald Trump is going to win reelection because he deserves it. He's done a great job leading our country. The great American comeback is happening. Americans understand common sense. They understand what needs to happen. And they're sick and tired of this liberal double standard where Mayor Garcetti can go out and kneel to the mob without a mask, thousands of protestors around him, but he's going to shut down schools and not let kids go learn this fall. It's crazy, and I think Americans are going to remember that on Election Day.INGRAHAM: Congressmen, it's great to see both of you. It's been a long time. Thanks so much for coming on.JORDAN: Good to be with you.INGRAHAM: All right, and the president's niece released her new tell-all book today, and the media of course laughing up her diagnosis. But is it medically deficient? Renowned psychiatrist Carole Lieberman is here. She's going to tell us the truth about Mary's sniping, next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)INGRAHAM: President Trump's niece Mary Trump released her supposed tell- all today, and in it the clinical psychologist diagnoses her uncle with severe personality disorders, writing, quote, \"I have no problem calling Donald a narcissist. A case could be made that he also meets the criteria for antisocial personality disorder, which is in its most severe forms generally considered sociopathy.\"But my next guest says Mary Trump's book reveals more about her and her own issues than it does about the president. Joining me now, I can't wait to hear, is Carole Lieberman, clinical forensic psychiatrist. Dr. Lieberman, what does she get wrong as far as you're concerned?DR. CAROLE LIEBERMAN, CLINICAL FORENSIC PSYCHIATRIST: Well, Mary Trump wants the public to believe everything she writes hook, line, and sinker. And she is basing this on the fact that she's the niece and therefore would have been privy to family dynamics, family events, and so on. But she, in regard to that, first of all, she is 20 years younger than president. And so her view of the family would've been very different from his. And so she's conjecturing when she is trying to say what things caused him to be - - to have what personality disorders.And plus, if the family is as maliciously -- malignantly dysfunctional as she says, then she obviously would have been and is affected by that as well. So that is affecting her truth telling.However, even more importantly, she says that we should believe her because she is a psychologist, a PhD psychologist. And yes, presumably that's correct. However, New York state has no record of her being licensed as a psychologist.INGRAHAM: OK, so New York, according to your looking into this, your research, she is not licensed in New York as a clinical psychologist? Really?LIEBERMAN: Yes. Unless she is going under some assumed name, which really they don't permit generally. It has to be a legal name.INGRAHAM: OK, we got that. Hold on the second, Doctor. Here is a snippet from Mary Trump's interview with ABC's George Stephanopoulos that will air tomorrow.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS, ABC NEWS: April, 2017, you see the president in the Oval Office. And you tell him don't let them get you down. Did you mean that?MARY TRUMP, DONALD TRUMP'S NIECE: I did. He said, they won't get me. So far it looks like he's right.STEPHANOPOULOS: And if you are in the Oval Office today, what would you say to him?MARY TRUMP: Resign.(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM: Dr. Lieberman, I don't know her. Is that a lot of anger right there? What is that?LIEBERMAN: Well, she's a very confused woman. And largely it has to do with her relationship with her grandfather, who does, according to her book, I read the whole book, he does seem like he was rather cold and had some problems. But really, she is angry at her father, her deceased father. And she's blaming all the problems that her father had on Donald Trump, on her grandfather as well. But he was an alcoholic. He didn't really work to join the grandfather. He wanted to fly planes and he wanted to go fishing while Donald was at Wharton studying business, and then going along with his father trying to learn the family business.And the reasons why she -- the motivations behind this are clearly greed, because she's still angry that she didn't get her share of her family fortune. Jealousy, jealousy of the success that Donald Trump has. Politics, she is totally opposite him in politics. And she says at the beginning of the book, I could've written this book any time, and I'm not trying to cash in now and I'm not trying to do this for political reasons and so on. I could've written about my uncle any time. And then at the end of the book she apparently forgets that she wrote that, and she says if anything I would've said about my uncle before it 2016, nobody would listen to.INGRAHAM: Dr. Lieberman, you read it very carefully. And we appreciate you joining us tonight. I will not read the book. No interest.And after building up a big early lead in the polls, has Joe Biden gone too far in the left? A Trump pollster shares some interesting insights you won't see anywhere else. Don't go away.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)INGRAHAM: So Joe Biden built up an early lead in the polls if you can believe them. But instead of pivoting towards the center, he is just embracing radicalism. No more moderate Joe. \"The Washington Post\" is reporting that Biden's vision comes into view, and it's much more liberal than it was. So does team Trump see an opening?Here now is John McLaughlin, Trump 2020 campaign pollster. John, the president still faces a pretty big deficit in that RCP average. Again, it was wrong before in 2016, but this is not 2016 for a variety of reasons, nearly 10 points. So what are the pollsters missing?JOHN MCLAUGHLIN, TRUMP 2020 CAMPAIGN POLLSTER: That average is based on polls of adults and registered voters, not likely voters. And I'll tell you, it's skewed. The same polls that they did four years ago because they didn't think we could win are now coming out because they're afraid we are going to win.And the president has had a great couple weeks. He lit up at 4.8 million new jobs, the Mount Rushmore speech, July 4th speech. Joe Biden admitted he wants to defund the police, sees the police as an enemy. And then he signs a socialist manifesto with Bernie Sanders where they are talking about just open borders, subsidizing -- giving welfare, taxpayer funded benefits to illegal immigrants, cutting the military, the defense, abolishing the police, criminal justice. It goes on and on.The president gave a great press conference today where he took it to Joe Biden and the campaign is on offence, and the polls are showing it. Those bad polls, the Rasmussen, Scott Rasmussen's poll had us gaining five. Zogby's poll had us gain six. The Hill-Harris poll had us within four, gaining six again. So the president --INGRAHAM: Hold on, hold on. Take a breath. Take a breath. Your point -- we have one minute here. Your point is that Biden is actually losing momentum on the national stage?MCLAUGHLIN: Yes. Yes, he's losing momentum on the national stage. And our 911 ad is doing great in terms of realizing people that we're changing the issues and we're moving things in the direction of the president, and that Biden is controlled by the radical left.INGRAHAM: John, quick point here. The issue of schools, being an advocate for their reopening, in 15 seconds, how important is that for women voters who want their kids back in school, 15 seconds?MCLAUGHLIN: Very important, because the argument is, what does more harm to their children? We can reopen the school safely with guidance principles, or their kids don't go to school. So they lose ground. So what is more harmful to their children? Keeping --INGRAHAM: All right, John, thank you. That was 15 seconds.Some breaking news regarding Kanye's candidacy? Oh, boy, stay there. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)INGRAHAM: Kanye West's audacious presidential campaign has come to an abrupt end. Here is the saga. New York Magazine's Ben Jacobs reached out to Kanye's publicist about the lack of ballot access. Quote, \"The initial response was to loop in another spokesperson on the email. West's team then went dark. As I waited for a response, I followed up with Kanye's get out the vote specialist Steve Kramer who told me he's out.\"Oh, I guess we'll have to wait for Kanye 2024.

For now, perhaps more places later followed by the words of two Americans who lost innocent loved ones to this violence.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: No mother should ever have to cradle her dead child in her arms because politicians refused to do what is necessary.

Every time I go out into the driveway that memory comes back and it haunts me.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: Those stories were hunting today at the White House. The President pushing this effort hearkens back to what some talked about in his inaugural address has a dark side of America.

This American carnage stops right here and stops right now!(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: So now on the cusp of a new election and a new wave of carnage that followed an economic search, flattened by the virus, economic distress, and now civil unrest. Individuals like this man and woman are making their demands on their government quite clear after they witnessed last night 15 people shot and wounded in their Chicago neighborhood. Listen to their words.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: That was a war out here.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The violence is day in and day out. And it's just unnatural with all of this fighting. It is a war zone. To send in federal troops, because really--(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: He says this is natural this violence, we need more cops and federal troops in Chicago. It's like we are in Iraq or something. Some suggest their problems are not real. But it is all exaggerated for election-year politics.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Sometimes when you analyze his moods and the words he uses and the decisions he makes that we don't look at it as a play for vote. Per se it might be. But it also might be a play to just not leave. It is something that a lot of people who know more about the rise of authoritarianism and things like it or looking at when it comes to this Presidency.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: And the New York Mayor writes to the Attorney General who laid out his battle plan for Urban America Today against the crimes. He said we do not consent do not sent the proposed agent. They have proved to bring way more harm than good.In less than four months from Americans across this country will weigh in and they all of you, will decide on the next President. So tonight we talked to Raymond Lopez a Democrat Chicago Alderman and Gary McCarthy the Former Superintendent of Chicago Police who will react to this new plan.We began tonight with Mr. Lopez. Thank you very much, sir, it is good to have you with us this evening. And I want to start by playing this sound bite today from Mayor Lightfoot who you have had a number of run-ins with. Here was her reaction to the plan.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MAYOR LORILIGHTFOOT, D-CHICAGO: That's not democracy that we saw unfolding on the streets of Portland as a result of this federal action. That is what we call Tierney, a dictatorship. And we are not having it in Chicago.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: What did you think when you heard that?RAYMOND LOPEZ, D-CHICAGO 15TH WARD ALDERMAN: No, it is unfortunate because the Mayor has been going back-and-forth with the President who in order to be perfectly honest, I don't agree on many of his policies.But protecting our citizen should not be a part of partisanship. As a Democrat, seeing my residence, seeing my family is gunned down is not a partisan issue. And for her to go weeks on end tweeting back and forth and making all kinds of comments and then finally admitting yesterday that she is - having the FBI, DEA and ATF come in, those comments that she made, how many lives were lost because of the politics of grandstanding in the City of Chicago?MACCALLUM: You know it is interesting. I think a lot of people you first got on the radar when that audio leaked of one of the meetings that you had with the alderman and the Mayor. But what I noticed when I went back and looked at it today, was that you were pretty much right on target about what was about to happen? Let's play that.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)LOPEZ: My fear is once they are done looting and riding and whatever is going to happen tonight, God help us, what happens when they start going after residents? I want an answer. It is not something you ignore. This is a question that I have.LIGHTFOOT: I think you are honestly full of - is what I think.LOPEZ: No offense but--(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: Wow, you know, I don't know what is going on between you two, but why is she so upset when it is suggested that something should be done to make the cities, streets safer in Chicago?LOPEZ: Well, I think part of the problem that the Mayor has with me is that I run contradictory to the narrative that she keeps trying to portray that she is in charge and she is in command of the COVID situation, the violence, when it is clearly obvious not only to the residents of Chicago and not only myself and I'm sure the Former Superintendent and the entire nation that our city is in chaos and in turmoil.When I can tell the Mayor that, I have addressed these issues in my ward. My ward is like the micro - of the City of Chicago we have poverty, we have working class people, we have gangs, we have violence.We were able to make significant gains in reducing those crimes that's year after year prior to this administration. You know, that message hurts her image. It hurts her personally because it is her micromanaging style. Unfortunately that level of pettiness is causing disaster in the City of Chicago right now.MACCALLUM: So, we have pictures of - you had your home was broken into, attacked, your office was also had shattered windows and glass. So you have been on the front line in this. But you are a Democrat. She is a Democrat. Who characterizes better where the people of Chicago are on this if that is an assessment that can be made?LOPEZ: Well, I think you know obviously we're City of Democrats but we're a city of different kinds of Democrats. I'm more of a middle-of-the-road kind of Democrat who believes that we can't have social justice. We can't have good relations with police and we can't have good safety all in the same city.It is possible and we've done it in my ward. Unfortunately, too many politicians in my city and across this nation find it easier to pander to the lowest common denominator in our society as opposed to challenging people to believe and inspire for something greater.And I, for one, know that can happen in our city again. We just have to start enforcing laws targeting individuals who will not change helping those people who want to change and knowing we can do better moving forward.MACCALLUM: That is pretty reasonable message. Alderman Lopez, we thank you very much for coming on tonight. Good to speak to you, sir.LOPEZ: Thank you Martha.MACCALLUM: So joining me now Gary McCarthy he Former Superintendent of the Chicago Police Department. Gary, good to have you with us again, what did you make of this announcement from the Attorney General Bill Barr and the Acting Homeland Security Director and the President today on what their plan is for your city?GARY MCCARTHY, FORMER CHICAGO POLICE DEPARTMENT SUPERINTENDENT: Listen having been through this a number of times, in New York, we had a search with ATF and we had enormous success. In Newark, we had a search with both DEA and the FBI and not only do we make a lot more good drug arrest that made a difference on the street, but the FBI worked with us on a corruption investigations.And then in Chicago, again, the ATF and the U.S. Marshals Service had a search with us. Again, it contributed to us getting to 50 year lows in the murder rate and in 2013-2014. I think it is a very myopic view. There is a lot of political saber raveling that's going on.If you snipe at the President in Chicago, you get political points for that. I'm sure the President gets points across the country for sniping. And this is happening in Chicago. So the law enforcement gets caught in the middle and so does the--MACCALLUM: You know, with regard to what has been said about this, one of the things that doesn't get talked about a lot is gang violence nature of this. And I wonder if you think as someone who has overseen and worked in several cities as you just pointed out, is the protest and everything that is going on tonight that we have seen over the past few months, does that pull police's attention away and allow the gangs to operate with a little bit more freedom?MCCARTHY: Yes, probably the case, Martha, but there is a much bigger dynamic that's going on for years now when I talk about this frequently. Ever since Ferguson, the police have been on the hills, they have been hamstrung and criminals have been involved in.And here in Chicago, we're seeing exponentially getting worse on a daily basis. Police officers are devastated. They are afraid to do their jobs because they're getting attacked physically emotionally and politically on a daily basis. Excuse me. So yes, there is a lot of that going on but it is a much bigger issue. This is happening across country.MACCALLUM: Chad Wolf was on this program last night and here is part of what he said.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CHAD WOLF, ACTING HOMELAND SECURITY SECRETARY: And so the department because we don't have that local support, that local law enforcement support, we're having to go out and proactively arrest individuals. We need to do that because we need to hold them accountable.This idea that they can attack that old property and law officers and go to the other side of the street and say you can't touch me is ridiculous. We don't do that in any other type of law enforcement.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: You have been now critical about some of what has happened in Portland with these officers in camera, right?MCCARTHY: Absolutely. And again, back to Ferguson, I think I coined the phrase that the police can turn a demonstration into a riot. That is what we did in Ferguson, you know it puts a lot of officers on the front line, confrontation gets met with confrontation.And going back to the 2012 NATO Summit here in Chicago where my executive staff was a guest. When I said that we're going to come out with - and the regular Chicago Police Uniform, they expected to go right into riot gear. And I said well, if you want to have a riot, let's make sure we do that. And the tactics that we used in Portland, very critical of, as far as the search goes--MACCALLUM: But look, I just want to put the video up Gary of what happened on Friday night while you finish your thought here because this is what's in people's minds when they think about the attacks on these police officers.MCCARTHY: Oh, yes, Martha - let's not - let's not confuse ourselves with the issues of not being ready to respond to violence. You know, as I have been saying, you can start out with a soft look but by the same token, you have to be ready to go to battle gear immediately.We need to have those mobile forces ready in riot gear. I'm talking about what we call a - with chest protectors not just uniforms. And I'm tired of listening to people talk about the police being in riot gear when they are wearing a helmet.Every police officer in the United States has a helmet and you use it when you need it. That is different than having a mobile task force that has been trained and worked to extract individuals from crowds who are the agitators, which is going to prevent the next incident from happening.MACCALLUM: Tough times, Gary McCarthy, thank you very much. We will see how this works out and always a pleasure to talk to you too. Thank you very much. So coming up a new report that is just in on what was really going on inside that Chinese Consulate in Houston, brand-new details moments ago, Senator Josh Hawley will respond coming out.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)MACCALLUM: Brand-new reports tonight on what's really going on inside that Chinese Consulate in Houston. Just hours after the U.S. Department ordered it shut down. We saw documents being burned in the courtyard there. Look at that fire there as it lights up in the Houston last night.NBC News is now reporting that this was a base that was used for spying operations on major U.S. industries, including medical research, oil, natural gas. The FBI was aware of this. They had briefed the President on this. And one thing is clear now, we are, it looks like in terms of our two countries and the relationship, quite a long ways from this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Does this change how you feel about President Xi? Is it a change in relationship with him?TRUMP: Look, I finished a trade deal that everybody said it would be impossible to get and not only was a trade deal it a great deal for this country. That was done months before the virus came. I am not going to say anything. I had a very good relationship. He is a strong man. He is a tough man, but I have very good relationship with him.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: It appears at this point to be strange, post-virus and that once promising trade deal now appear to be very much on the back burner. Here is the Secretary of State Mike Pompeo earlier today, watch this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MIKE POMPEO, SECRETARY OF STATE: President Trump has had enough. We are not going to allow this to continue to happen. We are setting up clear expectations how the Chinese Communist Party is going to behave? And when they don't, we're going to take actions to protect the American people, protect our security, our national security and also protect our economy and jobs.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: Republican Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri joins me now, Senator good to have you with us tonight. I guess my question is big picture, right? Are we going to look back on this data point of the closing of this Embassy and the burning of those documents has sort of a flash point of an escalation that leads to ultimately either a cold war or God forbid, a hard war with China over of course the next several years?SEN. JOSH HAWLEY, R-MO.: Well part of standing up to China now, Martha, is to prevent a hot war with them that certainly not what we want but we also can't be pushed around. And look we should be clear about the fact that China is an imperial power that they want to extend their power all around the world.And there is one nation in particular that stands between them and world domination and that is us. We're not going to be pushed around anymore. Today's action with the Consulate I think sends a clear signal to Beijing we're not going to tolerate their spying, we're not going to tolerate their espionage. We're not going to tolerate their breaking of the United States law. We're going to get tough it's about time.MACCALLUM: All right, they're working on a trade deal with EU. They have one relationship in Latin America and Africa. They're clearly sort of lining themselves up to be the next world dominant power which has been their desire for quite some time. How do we stop that?HAWLEY: Well, we stop it by doing what we did today, which is to stand up to them when they cheat, when they lie, it's also to expose their lies globally. For instance what they have lied about all the lies they told with COVID-19, trying to blame the origins of the virus on United States soldiers were having sick, total lie.That's why I've called for an international commission led by the United States to actually get the evidence to make China pay for what they have done to get reparations. But the truth is, Martha that they are on the back put the Chinese government is. You now have our allies waking up to the fact that UK is kicking out.Huawei the Chinese Telecom companies kicking out of United Kingdom. We've already taken those actions. China is in trouble here and they know that. That is why they are trying to double down. This is a moment where we have got to stand firm and say that we will not be pushed around. We will stand up for our people.MACCALLUM: Yes, here is the Former Vice President Joe Biden running for President, of course, on this topic, watch this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOE BIDEN, D-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Look what he's doing now? He's blaming everything on China. He's blaming everything on the Chinese and people don't make mistakes. As you well know from South Korean and someone from Beijing, they make no distinction, it is Asia. That is the way, he is just using it as a wedge, and he's trying to shift the blame.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: Your thoughts.HAWLEY: You know Vice President Biden has long been at China appeaser. He's long been an appeaser of authoritarian to Beijing. Just earlier this year, he was talking about how China didn't pose a real threat to the United States, I mean, oops, that is not exactly the story of 2020.We have seen this year what a threat China is to the world. So the Vice President, I think, is radically out of touch with reality on this as so many issues. But it is dangerous him being this out of touch on China. We need somebody, we need leadership that's going to stand up and be strong on China, be strong for American workers, be strong for American security.MACCALLUM: I just want to play this video. This is 2019 drone video that appears to show blindfolded Uighurs being transported according to one report, from one concentration camp to another. And this is an interview that Bill Hemmer did earlier today with the daughter of someone who is being held in one of these camps. This is really scary video. Listen to her.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JEWHER ILHAM, DAUGHTER OF IMPRISONED UIGHUR: My father is not the only person who is in prison. There are thousands of hundreds of Uighurs just like my father are locked up in a prison or concentration camp.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: Her father is a very well-known Economist in China. What do you think when you see that video, and does it change our relationship even more?HAWLEY: Should change our relationship. It should also inspire us to stand up and hold accountable those American, multinational corporations that have shipped our jobs over to China that are now using these Uighur concentration camps. That is what they are; they are concentration camps using them for cheap labor.That is one of the reasons Martha, I've launched this campaign called \"Slave Free\", #SLAVEFREE and I'm challenging all of these American multinationals beginning with the NBA, NIKE and others that make their products in China that use slave labor to pledge that they will be slave free. And I've introduced legislation to make sure it happens.MACCALLUM: I did read that the NBA is not practicing at one of their training camps in Xingjian anymore, small move but a step in the right direction?HAWLEY: Well, here is what it would be a real step and would show real progress. Are they willing to actually say that they will not make any NBA apparel in China with forced labor? Are they willing to take the pledge that the league does not rely on slave labor for any of its products? Is Lebron James willing to take the pledge that his NIKE products don't rely on slave labor? That come I think, which showed true progress.MACCALLUM: It would show that human rights are an issue, a universal issue that hold true. For these individuals who are obviously you know feel very strongly about human rights in this country. Senator Hawley, thank you good to see you tonight.HAWLEY: Thank you.MACCALLUM: So we're going to dig further into this issue with China because there is a lot of discussion about where our two countries are headed that will probably characterize the next decade of geopolitics.I will speak with the Secretary of State tomorrow night. Please tune in for that. Also up next, as Mayor De Blasio and the Teachers' Unions say there is not enough money to get ready to open the public school in the United States. They are refusing to let charter school students back into the classroom, despite their pleas to get back to work and hit the books early in August. That is next.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Regarding the children and your family, your son and grandchildren come are you comfortable and do you plan to have them back in person in school?TRUMP: Yes, I am comfortable with that.(END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: The radicals want to abolish charter schools and eliminate school choice. I want to expand school choice and every family in America should have that option.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: So as many public schools look forward - look toward learning from home, leaving some parents looking for alternatives. Charter schools are private or catholic schools for this fall, New York City's largest charter school network known as \"Success Academy\" was set to begin their 47 schools in just a few weeks.They always begin on the third week of August in order to get a jump on the school year. But now the mayor says that they can't enter the building that they share space with, with public schools.In an op-ed, Jason Riley writes, in many cases, inner city charter schools' students are outperforming their peers in the wealthiest and whitest suburban school districts in the country. In New York City, for example, the Success Academy charter school have effectively closed the academic achievement gap between black and white students.Success Academy CEO Eva Moskowitz joins me now. Eva, good to have you back on the program tonight. So, you had planned to put 20,000 mostly -- mostly black Latino students. I think the majority are in New York City back into the classroom on August 20th. Why can't that happen?EVA MOSKOWITZ, CEO, SUCCESS ACADEMY: Well, actually the high schoolers were supposed to start on the 4th of August. The mayor of New York would not give up access. And while we're largely free from government, but not in terms of the buildings. We are co-located, and we need the mayor to allow us to enter.And so, we are going to -- we're not whiners. We're going to make lemonade out of lemons. We've done remote learning in the spring. And we are going to offer our kids and families a world-class education remotely until we can open.We have a one-to-one program so all of our kids have devices, tablets with their touch screen. And for the older ones, a laptop. And we're going to make it work.MACCALLUM: Yes. And these are publicly funded schools. And you are making it work. You've got, everybody has got a device, as you say. What's your biggest fear, your biggest concern about these kids not being able to get into the classroom as planned?MOSKOWITZ: Well, in person learning is better. Schools, our communities, for the little ones imagine starting kindergarten and you've never been in your classroom. And you get an e-mail address, and you've to do everything in the rectangular box. It's not totally normal if you can say that.MACCALLUM: Yes, not at all.MOSKOWITZ: But we are going to make it work. We taught every child to read in the spring remotely. We did world history. We did calculus. All of the kids took their A.P.'s online.MACCALLUM: Yes, it's remarkable.MOSKOWITZ: And again, in the building we will make it work.MACCALLUM: I'm sure you will. You don't have a date for when you're going to be back in the classroom, right? You are waiting for New York?MOSKOWITZ: We're waiting for government.MACCALLUM: How many -- do you have -- how many kids are on a wait-list to get into your schools? And have you seen an increase in interest in switching over to your schools?MOSKOWITZ: We have over 15,000 parents on the wait list. It's one of the saddest things ever. We only have room for about 2,700 children. And actually, the poor performance of the district, you know you sent out links and worksheets, not relate teaching has meant that our demand has actually gone up.MACCALLUM: Worse, yes. Is the union playing a role in not getting back to school?MOSKOWITZ: Well, I just think it's a paralysis of government, you know, as a charter, a charter network. We're very agile --MACCALLUM: Absolutely.MOSKOWITZ: -- and nimble because we have some basic freedom.MACCALLUM: Yes. Eva Moskowitz, thank you. Great to see you tonight.MOSKOWITZ: Thank you, Martha.MACCALLUM: Good luck to you. Keep us posted.MOSKOWITZ: Thank you so much.MACCALLUM: Coming up, The New York Times out with a scathing piece on one of its former employees, Alex Berenson, accusing him of downplaying the severity of COVID-19 and cherry picking his facts. Tonight, he will respond here live to those allegations for the very first time on THE STORY, next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)MACCALLUM: New York times railing against one of its former reporters, Alex Berenson, over his critical response to government lockdowns and the media's COVID-19 hike. Writing, Mr. Berenson believes that the impact of the coronavirus is regrettable. Mostly inevitable and overstated that lockdowns are useless, masks don't help, and politicians are too worried about the deaths of old people who are going to die soon anyway.Mr. Berenson plays down counterevidence, even when it is first-hand or expert, writes the New York Times.Here now to respond, Alex Berenson, former New York Times reporter and author of \"Unreported Truths About COVID-19 And the Lockdowns.\" Alex, good to see you tonight.ALEX BERENSON, FORMER REPORTER, THE NEW YORK TIMES: Hi, Martha.MACCALLUM: Your response to this piece that was written by Ben Smith of the New York Times.BERENSON: Martha, honestly, I'm not really that interested in that piece. I have a lot of work to do writing about what's going -- what's happening now with the lockdowns, what we're doing with masks, you know, what's we're doing with vaccine going forward.There are huge public policy issues here on the table, and I think that that's what we should be focused on it. A number of people have written, you know, pieces about me in the last couple of months because they don't like what I write. I tried to write factual, you know, I tried to link everything to government documents or publish stories or (Inaudible) papers --(CROSSTALK)MACCALLUM: But that's what he's questioning. I mean, he did, he attacked you personally as well. He said you were harried and angry and reveling in the fight. But he also went after you in terms of your sources, saying that you, you know, your writing and your reporting flies in the face of the other wisdom that's out there.BERENSON: I mean -- I mean, so look, that source, that piece is actually better than a couple of the other pieces that has been written. You know, he said I was aggressive. Yes, I'm aggressive. I'm an investigative reporter.Like investigative reporters are aggressive. He said I was tall. Guess what, I'm also tall. I'm tall and I'm aggressive and I'm an investigative reporter.I think what's more interesting here is the way that the Times has sort of turned its guns not just on me but on, you know, on you, on Fox. And there used to be, I think a little bit of a sense in the media. You know, your report the news your way. We'll report the news our way. People can, you know, people can watch both and make decisions.MACCALLUM: Right.BERENSON: If the Times is going to start throwing stones about coronavirus courage, there's a lot -- they've made a lot of mistakes in the last couple of months.MACCALLUM: Yes.BERENSON: And one reason that reporters don't like me and it's not just the Times, is that I call people out on the stakes. And let me just give you one example. The last time or barely a week ago, a couple of reporters for ProPublica, a reporter from ProPublica, an NBC News, which of course your competition, wrote a story that was headlined all the hospitals in Houston are full.MACCALLUM: Right.BERENSON: All the hospitals in Houston are nowhere near full. There are 2,500 empty beds in Houston hospitals right now. That story was what I call panic porn.MACCALLUM: Yes.BERENSON: It was deliberately or not. It was an effort it fermented panic and that is wrong.MACCALLUM: Yes.BERENSON: And I'm going to call that out on Twitter. I'm going to call that out on your airwaves, I don't care if my friends in the media don't like me anymore because of it.MACCALLUM: You know, I mean, good for you. And as far as we're -- you know, we're used to it. We get it all the time. So, and we don't care either. So that makes two of us.But, you know, in terms of like the Houston story, for example. And when I say to people, you know, there was never a ventilator shortage in the United States. There's a lot of people who are shocked to hear that. Because people think that people were --BERENSON: That's right.MACCALLUM: -- you know, turned away because they, you know, they died because they couldn't get a ventilator. And you know, a lot of these things that become just sort of common understandings that simply are not true, which is obviously very dangerous here.But I do want to ask you about what Scott Gottlieb said today. Just in terms of the numbers. Because I want to match what you're seeing with what he is seeing. Let's play that.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SCOTT GOTTLIEB, FORMER COMMISSIONER, FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION: In the United States, probably, you know, by the end of the year we could have upwards of 300,000 if we continue on the current trajectory. Right now, we are close to 1,000 casualties a day.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: So, that's a big number, a 1,000 a day. And he says that if we stay on the current trajectory, we could get to 300,000. Does your reporting suggest that that is where we're headed here?BERENSON: Well, I mean, I think it's too early to tell. OK? You know, in the first and someone with unreported truths which Ben Smith actually mentioned in the Times piece, I said that a worst-case scenario here you could have up to 600,000 deaths.Most of those deaths if you look at who is dying occur in people who probably would have died by the year-end anyway. And 600,000 might be over two-year period. But could we get to 300,000? I'm not saying that's not impossible.Here's what I think people need to think about. When scenarios for like influenza pandemics were discussed in the last 15 years, the CDC, the WHO, they talked about in some cases more than two million Americans dying. And even then, they didn't think that mass lockdowns were a good idea.I'm not saying that 300,000 deaths is anything to take lightly.MACCALLUM: Yes.BERENSON: I'm not saying it doesn't mean we shouldn't stand up to hospitals and the nursing homes, but even if we get there, we have to think about the harm that lockdowns do economically, societally, socially, educationally.MACCALLUM: Yes.BERENSON: And I don't think it makes me a bad person or lacking empathy as Ben Smith also said, to think that maybe we should think about children and how and what we're doing is affecting them too.MACCALLUM: Alex, thank you. Alex Berenson always good to talk to you.BERENSON: Thanks.MACCALLUM: We'll see you soon.BERENSON: Thanks, Martha.MACCALLUM: All right. So, the Trump campaign respond to Joe Biden calling the president a racist today, earlier today. We'll talk about that when we come back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: My vision for American cities could not be more different from the lawlessness being pushed by the extreme radical left.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: As President Trump positions himself as the law and order candidate, his campaign has spent millions of dollars on this message.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The radical left-wing march agenda take over our cities, defund the police, pressure more towns to follow, and Joe Biden stands with them.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: That ad comes as the former vice president walks a delicate line, pushing for calm and violence ridden cities, appealing to black voters, and assuring that he can reform policing while also being tough on crime.Trump 2020 communications director Tim Murtaugh joins us in moments. But first, Jennifer Palmieri, former communications director for Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign and author of \"She Proclaims: Our Declaration of Independence from a Man's World.\"Jennifer, good to have you here tonight. Thank you for being here.JENNIFER PALMIERI, FORMER COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR, OBAMA AND CLINTON CAMPAIGN: Thanks, Martha.MACCALLUM: What is your reaction to that? Do you see this as, you know, an agenda that is framed at scaring people?PALMIERI: I do. I do fear of that. You know, it's regrettable, but I do fear that that's what the president is doing. It's interesting. I think that he is trying to, he's trying to strike fear in the hearts of some Americans and then at the same time, I see him trying to reach out to some black Americans.I notice today at the end of his press conference, he talked about how, in his opinion, I don't agree, he's done more for African-Americans than any other president. You know, alongside the times when the Trump campaign has run into ads that you talked about, they're also, I know they're also running ads targeted at trying to reach black voters too.MACCALLUM: Yes.PALMIERI: So, I think there it's a -- it's a -- it's a divide and conquer kind of strategy.MACCALLUM: So, I want to play what Joe Biden said about the president that prompted the response that you just mentioned.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BIDEN: He's spreading of racism, the way he deals with people --UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes.BIDEN: -- based on the color of their skin, their national origin, where they are from, is absolutely sickening. No sitting president has ever done this. Never, never, never. No Republican president has done this. No Democratic president. We've had racists and they've existed. They've tried to get elected as president. He's the first one that has.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: He said the president is racist. The first president in the country's history who is racist. To which the president answered with his response on the economy, prison reform, a number of things that he says a lot of other presidents have tried to do but never accomplished. Is that OK for this candidate, Biden, to call the sitting President of the United States a racist?PALMIERI: I think so in this case. I'm not sure that you and I will agree on this, but I do believe, Vice President Biden is right. The president very regrettable uses racism and fear to divide the country. And I think he does it to scare people.(CROSSTALK)MACCALLUM: Can you give me an example of that of how he's --(CROSSTALK)PALMIERI: The caravan that never -- the caravan that never materialized that he said would, I think to try to motivate people to turn out to vote - -(CROSSTALK)MACCALLUM: There were lots of people that were coming across the border, and they camped out south of the border for months.PALMIERI: Using the bible to, you know, the -- when he went to the church after tear gassing protesters at the Lafayette Square.MACCALLUM: How is that racist?PALMIERI: To suggest that people who protest don't believe in God, I think. I think it's using --(CROSSTALK)MACCALLUM: I think it was because they had burned the part of the church the night before.PALMIERI: It's using the issue to try to divide people. I think, you know, that's the problem. That's what I've never seen a Republican president in my lifetime who is doing this --(CROSSTALK)MACCALLUM: All I'm saying is -- all I'm saying is that if you are going to call someone a racist you better have some very concrete examples of how they are. It's one of the most serious things that you could call someone in the United States of America.PALMIERI: I think --(CROSSTALK)MACCALLUM: And obviously, this is a president who uses very strong language about people on his own, it's usually based on the individual rather than, you know, I see it based on the individual. And he is free with his criticism, there is no doubt about that.PALMIERI: He started his -- he started his campaign saying a lot of rapist -- Mexicans are racist and criminals. You know, he started his campaign with that. Throughout his campaign he has used race to divide and to scare people.MACCALLUM: All right. Let me just ask you one other thing with regard to your book. \"She Proclaims: Our Declaration of Independence from a Man's World.\" You wrote about the incident between AOC and Ted Yoho who called her very nasty names, including the f word and the b word. What is that incident reveal to you?PALMIERI: I actually think, you know, it does not, I mean, obviously, she should not have been subjected to that.MACCALLUM: Yes.PALMIERI: But my point of the piece was she was very able to deal with it. Right? I think that women, you know, what I want the women watching to know is I think all of us have experienced -- I never thought of myself as somebody as a woman working in the men's world. I just thought it was the world and I was doing great in it.And at some point, you realize that we're not making progress. We're not breaking through. I worked as hard as the men and yet the men I worked with even though they were really good colleagues to me and really supportive of me, grow as faster than I did.And I had the epiphany that I'm not doing great in a men's world. I'm doing great making it run and making it run well for them, sort of perpetuating these systems.And the point of the book is to say, like what's in your own mind that you can change to get yourself out of that rut? And I think Ocasio-Cortez with how she handled the situation with Yoho is a pretty good example of that.MACCALLUM: Very interesting. OK. Jennifer, thank you very much. Good to have you here. I hope you'll come back and we'll talk more about the election as it moves forward. It's going to be a feisty one. I know you always bring a lot to the table, so I'm glad you're here. Thank you.PALMIERI: Thanks, Martha.MACCALLUM: So, also here tonight, Trump 2020 communications director Tim Murtaugh. Tim, thank you for being here as well. Your thoughts on Joe Biden saying that President Trump is the first racist president in this country, which as I said, is an extremely serious thing to level at any one.TIM MURTAUGH, TRUMP 2020 COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR: It is. And it's ridiculous. There is a reason why Joe Biden is doing this. And it's because he knows that he's got a really serious problem with black voters in this election.All you have to do is take a look at what Joe Biden is doing. When was the last time, Martha, you can remember that a Democrat presidential campaign in a general election was actually running ads aimed at attracting the support of black voters? It's really unheard of. And the reason he's doing that is because he knows his support among black voters in America is soft. And to get --(CROSSTALK)MACCALLUM: I think we have the numbers here. We can put them up. Tim, sorry to interrupt but he does have a smaller lead with black voters than Hillary Clinton did. She was plus 79, he is plus 75. Obviously. a huge margin but a smaller lead. Go ahead.MURTAUGH: The president -- the president has made great inroads among black voters and among a lot of different voters, Latinos included. And it's because the president has a clear record of support, a clear record of achievement in the black community.Before the coronavirus crisis interrupted the great economy, it was an all- time low unemployment rate for black voters.MACCALLUM: That's true.MURTAUGH: Historic funding for HBCUs, criminal justice reform. Joe Biden, on the other hand is no one to be giving racial justice lectures to. This is a man who has bragged in the past about his great relationships with notorious, racist senators from the past. He bragged about receiving an award for George Wallace.He eulogized the former exalted cyclops of the KKK, Senator Byrd. No one should be listening to a lecture on racial justice from Joe Biden.And it's the president, President Trump who has a great record of achievement on behalf of black voters, and that is something that we are very proud of. Joe Biden, he knows he's got a problem with black voters. That's why he's needing to spend money to advertise to black voters, which Democrat presidential candidates never have to do.MACCALLUM: I think we're all looking forward to these debates. And we hope that they're going to be substantive. But, you know, I think that Joe Biden will have to answer for that charge. And you have to be very specific as I said, it's a very serious charge.Tim Murtaugh, thank you, sir. Good to see you.MURTAUGH: Sure. Thank you, Martha.MACCALLUM: Quick break here. More of \u201cThe Story\u201d when we come back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)MACCALLUM: So that is the story of Wednesday, July the 22nd, 2020. Thanks for being here tonight. As always, the story goes on.

I'm Mike Emanuel in for Bret Baier. President Trump is taking a quick trip to Mount Rushmore to watch some July third fireworks along with thousands of people. The event comes despite the U.S. reporting another record high in new coronavirus cases today. In his speech tonight, President Trump is expected to speak about the history of America and warned against those he sees trying to divide the country. We will have life coverage of the big event tonight at 10:00 p.m. Eastern. The president will return to Washington well past midnight to prepare for tomorrow's festivities back home at the White House. That's where we begin tonight with Correspondent Mark Meredith on the North Lawn. Good evening, Mark. MARK MEREDITH, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Good evening to you, Mike. At this hour, the president and first lady, they are in the air making their way to Mount Rushmore for that fireworks as you also mentioned, they'll be having a remarks tonight. While they are there in South Dakota, we expect the president is going to call out cancel culture and also criticize those that want to tear down monuments in the name of rewriting American history. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We're going to Mount Rushmore. MEREDITH: President Trump is kicking off his holiday weekend with a trip to South Dakota's Mount Rushmore where at least 75,000 people are expected to watch a fireworks extravaganza. TRUMP: I'll be seeing a lot of people, a lot of different people. And I think it will be a fantastic evening. MEREDITH: Organizers say masks will be provided but people won't be required to wear them. Meantime, some Native American tribes who calls South Dakota home are protesting the visit, they want Mount Rushmore torn down. The leader of the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe writing, we are the ones who live under the stare of those who have wronged us. On Saturday, the president will host a salute to America event. The White House inviting front-line workers including doctors and nurses to the celebration while tens of thousands are expected to gather on the National Mall for a military flyover and fireworks. Mall goers are encouraged to practice social distancing. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: CDC says larger gatherings are a higher risk. You have to take that into account again with whether or not you're at risk, whether you live with someone who is vulnerable and then you have to take measures to say safe. MEREDITH: As several states experience a surging COVID cases, Dr. Anthony Fauci says the virus itself may be mutating, essentially allowing it to spread more easily. But he says more research is needed to know for sure. DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES: It just seems that the virus replicates better and may be more transmissible, but this is still at the stage of trying to confirm that. MEREDITH: President Trump tweeted Thursday, the increase in cases is easy to explain, writing, quote, there's a rising coronavirus cases because our testing is so massive and so good. Far bigger and better than any other country. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Joe Biden can't fix our economy. MEREDITH: The president's campaign is focused elsewhere. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Trade deals that let China and Mexico steal our jobs. MEREDITH: The Trump campaign released this new T.V. ad today only hours after the June jobs report showed 4.8 million jobs were added last month. The ad maybe the most clear sign yet the Trump campaign hopes to win voters over by appealing directly to people's pocketbooks. (END VIDEOTAPE) MEREDITH: In his remarks tonight, the president expected to call America a great and virtuous country but he's also going to say some of the chaos that we've seen these last couple of weeks is a responsibility of a left- wing mob, Mike. EMANUEL: Mark Meredith leading us off on the North Lawn. Mark, many thanks. The way that spikes started in the South moved West, but now at least 40 states are seeing climbing new coronavirus cases. Governors have ordered the wearing of masks in public and families are being urged to celebrate Independence Day at home. Correspondent Jonathan Serrie is in Atlanta looking at the concerning coronavirus trends across the country. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) TERRENCE REIDY, UNDERSECRETARY, MASSACHUSETTS PUBLIC SAFETY: The virus isn't taking a holiday. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Feel pain anywhere? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No. JONATHAN SERRIE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: As the U.S. grapples with a new spike in COVID-19 cases, this July 4th promises to be like no other. With many cities canceling or scaring back fireworks displays, authorities are trying to discourage amateurs from filling the vacuum. REIDY: I word to anyone who's thinking about a backyard firework show, don't. Fireworks are illegal in Massachusetts and dangerous in untrained hands. SERRIE: To discourage crowds in Florida, the Blue Angels announced they will not fly at the Pensacola Beach Air Show and Airbnb announced its banning parties in regions with public health mandates against large gatherings including the Sunshine State which set a new state record for new COVID cases on Thursday. BREN BREIT, SPOKESMAN, AIRBNB: What we and the Florida surgeon general really want -- you know, potential travelers to know is that we need to be prioritizing safe and responsible travel and that really means no parties. SERRIE: Public health officials are trying to discourage a repeat of large Memorial Day gatherings which they say contributed to a dramatic surge in COVID-19 cases that appeared in the following weeks. Even in the great outdoors, officials urged caution as larger than usual numbers are expected a popular natural attractions such as the American River in California. SGT. RANDY BICKEL, PARK RANGER, SACRAMENTO COUNTY: We're going to do our best to keep educating people. Please ask them to wear masks, ask them to social distance and try to respect to other people's space. SERRIE: In North Carolina which today reported its highest number of hospitalizations in new cases. Officials are framing mask wearing as more than just an issue of public health. DR. MANDY COHEN, SECRETARY, NORTH CAROLINA HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES: Wear a face covering because you want to reignite the economy and support businesses. Wear a face covering so our children can be back at school. (END VIDEOTAPE) SERRIE: And today Kansas and Texas began requiring people to wear face masks in public joining 20 states with similar mandates. But other states such as Georgia are hoping that voluntary appeals will be enough to encourage people to do the right thing, Mike. EMANUEL: Jonathan Serrie live in Atlanta. Jonathan, thanks a lot. For more on the coronavirus pandemic, joining me now is Fox News Contributor Dr. Janette Nesheiwat. Doctor, it's great to have you. DR. JANETTE NESHEIWAT, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Thank you. EMANUEL: We've seen some of the COVID-19 hot spots closed down, beaches and parks this Independence Day weekend, is that wise? NESHEIWAT: Well, yes, there's an area of an outbreak for example in Miami, certain parts of Arizona, certain parts of Texas because the concern is close people in high density crowd clusters, they can transmit the virus from one person to another. Now, the ocean or pools, they're safe, it's just that the condensed crowd is what -- is the concern for transmission of this virus. And you know, this Fourth of July holiday weekend has the potential for a perfect storm and with over 50,000 new cases daily and some hospitals maxing out their ICU capacity really need to take aggressive action and try to celebrate this holiday weekend at home so that we minimize person to person interaction with new people outside of your family. Really important of course in addition to that physical distancing. And if you are going to go out and celebrate, try to keep six to 10 feet and try to socialize outdoors and of course wear your masks. That's really important because the mask can help the transmission reduction from about 17 down to about three percent which can really save thousands of lives over the next few months. EMANUEL: As much of the country has reopened, there's been a real emphasis on those masks for Americans who have quarantined fatigue. How much of a difference does wearing a mask make when you're out and about? NESHEIWAT: Well, so, wearing a mask does not mean you should not practice physical distancing. The latest data that we have actually shows you're not only protecting others but you can actually be protecting yourself. And it also showed that by October, 33,000 lives would be saved. So it certainly helps, it's not 100 percent, that's why in addition to wearing your mask, physical distancing, hand hygiene, trying to avoid clusters crowds, areas with high density like bars and restaurants are really really important, especially because this virus potentially could be mutating to the point where it's three to nine times more transmissible, three to nine times more contagious. So that's really a big issue. So we have the tools and the knowledge and the power to fight and combat this virus, it's just a matter of compliance, being attentive and adhering to these CDC guidelines. EMANUEL: Doctor, in our final moments here, as you know young people think they're invincible. A final message to them heading into this Independence Day holiday weekend. NESHEIWAT: Be safe, be smart, we want to open up sooner than later. Remember, this virus can affect anyone from newborns, from children to senior citizens. And together we can all -- you know, protect one another and open up sooner than later. So really important to galvanize one another to do the right thing so that we could get back on our feet again. And remember, sometimes it's just safer to act as if we are all asymptomatic carriers and get back on our feet again. EMANUEL: And finally, is it smart to watch the fireworks from home? Perhaps look up in the sky or perhaps even on T.V.? NESHEIWAT: Yes, definitely a safer alternative because of your outdoors in close contact with one another, talking, shouting, screaming, you can transmit the virus, it can aerosolize and get into the nose, the mouth and the eyes of other people and definitely you can acquire the virus that way. So any opportunity we have to protect ourselves, to protect one another, we should certainly take that opportunity. EMANUEL: Dr. Janette Nesheiwat, wishing you a safe and healthy Independence Day weekend. Thanks for your time. NESHEIWAT: Thank you. Thank you, Mike, you too. EMANUEL: The Washington Redskins announced a thorough review of their name amid public pressure from major sponsors like Nike and FedEx. Correspondent David Spunt is following that story. Good evening, David. DAVID SPUNT, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Hi Mike, good evening to you. Even talk of a name change has been a long time coming when it comes to this team as you mentioned, the top draft with the Washington Redskins just conducting a review. No final decisions have been made at this point but the wheel started really moving yesterday when fed out -- FedEx, excuse me, put out an incredibly direct statement to all of the fans across the country and to the team management. I want to read it to you, it says, we have communicated to the team in Washington our request that they change the team name. Mike, that single sentence got Redskins owner Daniel Snyder's attention. FedEx owns the naming rights for the team's stadium. Now this request comes just a day after Adweek reported that 87 investment firms and shareholders sent a letter urging Nike, Pepsi, and FedEx to stop doing business with the team until that team name changes. Now, go to the Nike site if you want to try to buy something Redskins related, you can't. The company took all Redskins merchandise off the site until there is a name change. The name change isn't just important to people who are fans of the team last October when the Redskins played the Vikings' demonstrators in Minneapolis marched against the team name. Owner Dan Snyder released a statement this week quote, this process allows the team to take into account not only the proud tradition and history of the franchise but also input from our alumni, the organization, sponsors, the National Football League and the local community. It is proud to represent on and off the field. Quite a far cry Mike, from Snyder's comments to USA Today seven years ago where he said, quote, we'll never change the name. It's that simple. Never. You can use caps. The new head coach, Ron Rivera who was previously in Charlotte said, quote, this issue is of personal importance to me and I look forward to working closely with Dan Snyder to make sure we continue the mission of honoring and supporting our -- supporting Native Americans and our military. Now, online like a lot of people are talking about different names, suggesting different names to the team. One of those names you can expect not to see, the Braves, that's the original name for the team but NFL leader Roger Goodell said he is supportive if the team wants to change its name, Mike. EMANUEL: David Spunt reporting live. David, thanks a lot. In our Democracy 2020 report, former Vice President Joe Biden is expected to announce his own V.P. choice in early August. Biden has narrowed the list by saying it will be a woman. Correspondent Jacqui Heinrich looks at some of the candidates. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JACQUI HEINRICH, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Conventional wisdom among people who study gender and politics says former Vice President Joe Biden will likely pick a woman of color as his running mate, most likely a black woman. The country's demanding diversity at the table but also that move may motivate a key voting black, black woman who voted at the highest rates of any racial and gender group in the 2008 and 2012 elections. LORI COX HAN, PROFESSOR OF POLITICAL SCIENCE, CHAPMAN UNIVERSITY: Normally running mates, we don't help that much. I mean, there's no real political science data that says that they do, but then 2020 is a whole different ball game. HEINRICH: Experts consider Senator Kamala Harris the top pick vetted on a national stage. In her own presidential campaign, she brings legislative and law enforcement experience despite progressive criticism of her record as attorney general. (INAUDIBLE) Florida Congresswoman Val Demings, a former police chief from a swing state also drew national attention during the Black Lives Matter protest and in her roles in impeachment manager. Other picks like Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms and Stacey Abrams, lack federal experience but California Congresswoman Karen Bass has it, past praise of Fidel Castro could hurt her with Florida voters. And Susan Rice, Obama's former national security advisor would add to Biden's foreign policy know-how. Biden has not committed to choosing a black woman but experts say the choice will reflect the future of the party. There's a chance Progressives get left behind. Senator Elizabeth Warren's in the running, but she's white and older. KELLY DITTMAR, RUTGERS UNIVERSITY: I don't think she would lose a lot of voters but I think there would be also a level of disappointment and concern about, OK, where Joe Biden are you going to make sure our voices are at this table? HEINRICH: With other woman of color offering perspective and experience like Senator Tammy Duckworth an Asian-American combat veteran, experts think it's unlikely white woman on the short list will make the cut. (END VIDEOTAPE) HEINRICH: Experts believe the main driver in Biden's choice is unifying the Democratic Party, Mike. EMANUEL: Jacqui Heinrich in New York. Jackie, thanks a lot. Ghislaine Maxwell is behind bars in charge with helping Jeffrey Epstein sexually exploit and abuse multiple minor girls. One woman says when she was 14 years old, Maxwell recruited and raped her. The victim who has asked remain anonymous spoke with Fox News. Correspondent Bryan Llenas has this report that you may find disturbing. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: She is just as evil as Jeffrey Epstein. BRYAN LLENAS, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: For the first time, a woman who wishes to conceal her identity is speaking publicly alleging Ghislaine Maxwell begins sexually abusing her in 1991 when she was just 14 years old. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: She did rape me. I would say it's more than 20 or 30 times. She is a rapist. Destroyed my what was supposed to be the best years of my life being a teenager, being a cheerleader. LLENAS: She claims Maxwell would abuse her with Epstein and sometimes alone coaching her, have her to have sex with men. The abuse stopped when she was 16, after became pregnant with Epstein's baby, and had to have an abortion. Her attacker grew fearful she would tell her grandparents or the authorities, but for good measure, she says she was gang-raped one last time as punishment. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Ghislaine was a part of it and Jeffrey Epstein's a part of it, and I was drugged. Gang-raped and left on the lawn and they put a gun to me. And the man that drove me home said I would never be (INAUDIBLE), I never come back alive if I spoke about it. LLENAS: Jane Doe's legal team is researching whether she can pursue criminal charges, but she is willing to serve as a witness against Maxwell in her upcoming trial. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Absolutely, I would definitely take a stand and testify. JORDAN MERSON, ATTORNEY FOR MAXWELL'S ALLEGED VICTIM: People felt, you know, cheated when Mr. Epstein committed suicide in prison and they didn't get a chance to sit in the courtroom and see the judicial system play out. And they're hoping that there's a different result here. (END VIDEOTAPE) LLENAS: According to her attorney, Jane Doe's grandparents have corroborated her claims. When asked about these specific allegations, an attorney for Ghislaine Maxwell, said, \"no comment.\" Mike? EMANUEL: Bryan Llenas, thanks very much. Up next, to look back at lessons learned from racial tensions in the 1960s, and why they were rejected by the Democratic president. First, here is what some of our Fox affiliates around the country are covering tonight. FOX 10 in Phoenix, where police say a man robbing a gas station convenience store fatally shot a bystander. The robber turned shooter, then was killed in a Wild West shootout with another bystander who was injured in the exchange of gunfire. None of those involved was immediately identified. FOX 29 in Philadelphia, reporting on Major League Baseball announcing they've had 38 positive COVID-19 tests as training resumes. 31 players and seven staff are infected, spread across 19 teams. Opening day has been rescheduled for July 23rd. And this is a live look at Denver from Fox 31. One of the big stories there tonight, Colorado joins New Jersey and New Hampshire in allowing legal betting on Nathan's Famous Hot Dog Eating Contest for the first time in the event's history. The July 4th tradition will take place at an undisclosed private location with social distancing measures in place rather than Coney Island, New York. That's tonight's live look \"OUTSIDE THE BELTWAY\" from SPECIAL REPORT. We'll be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) EMANUEL: In the mid to late 1960s, riders rampaged through many American cities. At that time, the Kerner Commission comprised of blacks and whites, Liberals and Conservatives was established to look into the unrest. The group's conclusions were roundly rejected by the country's Democratic president. Since then, history has repeated itself time and again. Correspondent Douglas Kennedy, reports on the Commission's predictions and talks to its last surviving member. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DOUGLAS KENNEDY, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: This is all really familiar. JOHN KOSKINEN, FORMER COMMISSIONER, INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE: Yes, this is a scene that, unfortunately, has been repeated many times in the past. KENNEDY: Detroit 1967, Los Angeles 1992, Ferguson 2014, everywhere 2020. For some, it's the same thing all over again. John Koskinen doesn't want to say I told you so. But back in 1968, he worked for a commission that predicted it all. So, the Kerner Commission was actually the first time the U.S. government identified racial inequality and institutionalized racism as the root cause of urban social unrest. KOSKINEN: That's right and that's why it was so controversial at the time. KENNEDY: It's most famous passage warned, \"Our nation is moving toward two societies, one black, one white, separate and unequal.\" They were conclusions that irritated then-President Lyndon Johnson, who wanted the commission to conclude that outside groups were the problem, organizing protests for nefarious political purpose. FRED HARRIS, FORMER SENATOR OF OKLAHOMA: President Johnson himself, unfortunately, believed that there was some conspiracy behind these riots or disorders. He thought that they were organized. And we found that, that was simply not true. KENNEDY: Former Oklahoma senator, Fred Harris is the last surviving member of the actual commission. HARRIS: Now, that police have become more and more militarized, more and more separated from the community where they're supposed to protect and serve. KENNEDY: The Kerner Commission concluded that racism was everyone's problem and that racial inequality would never be solved unless everyone came together to solve it. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: No justice! UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No peace! UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: No peace! KENNEDY: It's a sentiment, Koskinen, says is apparent as much today as it was back then. But today's protests are actually giving you a little bit of hope. KOSKINEN: Well, yes. Because I think what people have been able to see is visible representations of the difficulties African Americans have in a day to day basis in their relationship with the white superstructure but certainly with the police. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: What I want? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: (INAUDIBLE) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (INAUDIBLE) KENNEDY: Both he and Harris say we have a chance now to finally address these generation's old problems. And they say we better take advantage of it. Just outside Lafayette Square in Washington, D.C., Douglas Kennedy, Fox News. (END VIDEOTAPE) EMANUEL: Up next, we hear from some World War II veterans ahead of the Independence Day weekend. First, \"BEYOND OUR BORDERS\" tonight. At least four people are dead and nearly 100 injured after an explosion at a fireworks factory in northwestern Turkey. At least three people are unaccounted for, efforts to control the fire were hampered by continuing explosions. The cause is unknown at this point. Botswana is launching an investigation after 275 elephant carcasses have been found in recent weeks. Poaching which is a problem and the country has been ruled out as the cause. Wildlife officials are using aircraft to better understand the mysterious loss of life. COVID-19 is considered an unlikely candidate, but for now, nothing including poison has been ruled out. The USS Dwight D. Eisenhower has now spent 169 straight days at sea, a record for an American warship. The nuclear-powered aircraft carrier is currently in the Arabian Sea. Just some of the other stories \"BEYOND OUR BORDERS\" tonight. We'll be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) EMANUEL: The Fourth of July marks one moment of independence for America, but the fight for freedom did not end in the 1700s. Through many wars, political debates, and centuries, the fight is continued. With assistance from National Geographic, my colleague Brett Baier, looks back at the greatest generation who helped win World War II, 75 years ago. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BRET BAIER, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: They are among the last surviving voices of the Second World War. HARRY STEWART, VETERAN, WORLD WAR II: I never thought that I'd have the chance to actually train and become a pilot. But World War II came along. VICTOR GREGG, VETERAN, WORLD WAR II: Every word I'm going to tell you, there's no make-believe or anything. And whether you acknowledge it or not, it's going to be the truth. BAIER: The stories of these two veterans and others are chronicled in National Geographic's coverage of the 75th anniversary of the end of World War II, in their June 2020 issue. That quarter-century milestone is being celebrated across the globe. From a military parade in Moscow's Red Square to celebrate the victory over Nazi Germany to multiple commemorations this year at D.C.'s memorial to the war on the National Mall. The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs estimates that about 300,000 American World War II veterans are still alive, yet with that number declining every year, capturing their stories is more critical than ever. Harry Stewart served with the Tuskegee Airman. Just 10 of the famed Tuskegee Airman remain today. STEWART: I just felt as though I was meant to be in an airplane. I got so if felt as though the aircraft was an extension of my body. I felt as though my arms were the wings. BAIER: He says he wants the Tuskegee Airmen to be remembered as good citizens who helped protect their country during a time of need, even in the face of discrimination. STEWART: It was quite a thing because people wondered, well, these guys had been segregated all the time. And how do they fly? Are they good pilots? The answer is, yes. BAIER: After postwar budget cuts forced Stewart out of the Air Force, he was denied a position as a commercial pilot with Pan American and Transworld Airlines because of his race. STEWART: When I got out of the service, I applied with a couple of airlines as a pilot, and I was denied being accepted because of my color. So I went back to school, and I got my degree in mechanical engineering. As the years passed, I would go to the airport there, and I'd look in the cockpit, and lo and behold there's an African-Americans sitting behind the controls there ready to fly the aircraft. And the one that truly brought tears to my face was when not one, but there were two African-Americans sitting in the cockpit theare. They were both women. So, that was quite a thing. BAIER: For Victor Gregg, an offer of a hot of tea lured him to a recruiting office in London where he signed up for the British Army on his 18th birthday. Serving as a rifleman, his name was pulled out of a hat to join a parachute brigade. He says they received their training for that task while on the job. VICTOR GREGG, WORLD WAR II VETERAN: Consequently, when we jumped, we lost more people on the descent in the first hour that we lost through the six days of the fight. Out of the 460 who jumped, there's only about 180, I think. All the rest were dead. And they was jumping on the dead bodies of the blokes who had jumped the day before. BAIER: Both men say they served out of a sense of duty to their countries. GREGG: My attitude of the war was that's what we're supposed to do. If the Colonel told us to do anything, we done it. If he says we're here to stay, that's it. We made the best of it. STEWART: I'm a strong patriot. I feel this is nothing like the Constitution that we have of the United States, which is the most beautiful document anybody could ever read. The practice of it is not perfect, it's not perfect today, it may not be perfect tomorrow, but it keeps getting closer and closer and closer right on out to infinity. BAIER: In Washington, Bret Baier, FOX News. (END VIDEOTAPE) MIKE EMANUEL, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: President Trump pushes ahead with July 4th festivities despite spiking virus numbers and a warning from health officials. The panel is next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, (R) PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We're going to Mount Rushmore, Mount Rushmore is in great shape, and it's going to be in great shape for centuries to come. We are looking forward to it. I'll be making a speech there. I'll be seeing a lot of people, a lot of different people. If you look at what's going on, if you look at the numbers all over, I think we're going to have a very strong V-shape. DR. JEROME ADAMS, U.S. SURGEON GENERAL: Every single person has to make up their own mind. There are going to be people going to beaches, going to barbecues, going to different environments, and they have to look at their individual risk. As you mentioned, CDC says larger gatherings are a higher risk. The most important thing I would say to people as if you do go out to a gathering or in public, please weare a face covering. (END VIDEO CLIP) EMANUEL: President Trump making his way to Mount Rushmore. We can give you a live look there courtesy of the White House of the scene, folks waiting for the arrival of Air Force One, and President Trump and senior administration officials are telling us the president is going to talk about on the anniversary of America's founding, he will tell the truth about America's histories and tell the truth about those trying to tear it down and divide our country. Key points the president is expected to make, America is a great and virtuous country. If we tear down our history we will not be able to understand ourselves or America's destiny. And they add he will say the leftwing mob and those practicing cancel culture are engaging in totalitarian behavior that is completely alien to American life, and we must not accept it. With that, let's bring in our panel, Byron York, chief political correspondent for the \"Washington Examiner,\" Julie Pace is the Washington Bureau Chief for the Associated Press, and \"Washington Post\" columnist Marc Thiessen. Panel, welcome. Byron, your thoughts and the themes the president is going to strike tonight. BRYON YORK, CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, \"WASHINGTON EXAMINER\": Well, one of the themes he's apparently going to talk about essentially is law and order in this time of unrest. And he's been inconsistent in the way he has dealt with that disorder across the country and really needs to develop a consistent position. How many people have watched as crowds tried to tear down or tore down a statue in a number of cities across the country, and their first thought was, where at the police? And the president himself almost allowed a mob to take down the statue of Andrew Jackson in Lafayette Park right in front of the White House. The president actually needs to get a stronger, more consistent position on that, and make clear where he stands on all of this. EMANUEL: Julie, we are four months to the day from Election Day. Obviously, President Trump misses the opportunity to get out and speak to his crowds. He's going to Mount Rushmore tonight. Your thoughts? JULIE PACE, WASHINGTON BUREAU CHIEF, ASSOCIATED PRESS: In talking to a lot of Republicans this week, there was a hope that the president four months from Election Day would be trying to reach out to some of those disaffected Republicans, some of those independents who don't necessarily see the president reflecting their views, their concerns about the public health crisis, about the economy. And instead, I think what we're going to see tonight is a president who is really meaning into the message that his base wants to hear. He sees this election as one where he can win if his base turns out in really large numbers, and I think he is signaling to those, again, Republicans who I've talked to this week who would like to see him just ever so slightly reach out to those independents that this is, again, going to be a campaign that is really targeted toward that base. EMANUEL: We have the luxury of having a former White House speech writer on the panel tonight, so Marc, your thoughts on the themes going into tonight's big event? MARC THIESSEN, AMERICAN ENTERPRISE INSTITUTE: If I was advising the president, what I would tell him to do is quote Dr. Martin Luther King. Dr. Martin Luther King actually rejected the principles of the 1619 project and the idea that America's founding was inherently racist. And I would encourage him and, quite frankly, anyone today over the a Fourth of July weekend to go back and read the \"I have a Dream\" speech, because Martin Luther King embraced the principles of the American founding. He said that we need to live up to those principles. I want to give you a section of it. He said, \"In a sense, we have come to our nation's capital to cash a check. When the architects of our republic wrote the magnificent words of the Constitution and the Declaration, they were signing a promissory note to which every American was to fall heir. That note was a promise to all men, yes, black men as well as white men would be guaranteed unalienable rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. And we've come to cash that check.\" This is the opposite message of the Black Lives Matter movement. What Martin Luther King was saying was not that just racism was unfair, racism is un-American. The Black Lives Matter movement is saying that the opposite of it, that basically racism is as American as apple pie, that it's baked into our system, and that is a message that Martin Luther King absolutely rejected. EMANUEL: A big difference form last Fourth of July to this year when we had massive crowds on the National Mall in the rain to hear the president speak, as of course, COVID-19. Here is Dr. Anthony Fauci sounding the alarm. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES: \u00a0I think the data is showing that there is a single mutation that actually makes the virus be able to replicate better and maybe have high viral loads. It just seems that the virus replicates better and may be more transmissible. But this is still at the stage of trying to confirm that. But some very good viral geneticists are working on that right now. (END VIDEO CLIP) EMANUEL: Four months out from Election Day, Byron, what are the COVID-19 concerns? YORK: They're real, and they're growing, although there's a different characteristic to this wave of the disease in the sense that there are better treatments for it, no doubt about that. Politically, part of the big problem of the president's rally in Tulsa was that he held a large gathering indoors. And that is really the highest risk of transmission. The think about the Mount Rushmore event is that perhaps there won't be a lot of social distancing, perhaps not everybody will wear a mask, but it will be outdoors, which is a much better idea. And the president took a lot of criticism for that, holding the rally indoors in Tulsa. Now, it would be perhaps comparable to a lot of the protests that we've seen across the country, most of which were also outdoors. EMANUEL: Julie, from the White House video, it looks like a great crowd there at Mount Rushmore. Your thoughts heading into the event tonight with the COVID-19 concerns? PACE: I think one of the challenges for the president right now is he so clearly wants to move past the pandemic. He really wants to focus on the economy. He wants this to be behind us, but it's not. And so he has this challenge as he addresses that crowd, as he talks to the nation over the next several months is to not look as though he is ignoring what is happening in a lot states. A lot of the states that we are talking about right now where we do see cases on the rise are battleground states, states where the president has to win if he wants a second term. And I do think that he has a lot of advisors around him who want him to address what's happening there. EMANUEL: Next up, the Friday Lightning Round, the debate over renaming the Washington Redskins, vice presidential Candidate Casino, and this week's Winners and Losers. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: In the same way Redskins has evolved, and despite its history, it is now considered a slut. It's nothing to do with the sensitivities of a mass of people. It has to do with a decent, simple, elementary respect. You don't use that word if you can avoid it. (END VIDEO CLIP) EMANUEL: That was the late great Charles Krauthammer opining on the Redskins name change. Nearly seven years later the debate continues, and we're back with our panel, Byron, Julie, and Marc. Byron, so Daniel Snyder has gone from heck no, never, ever, to some major sponsors saying we are pulling our money, so now it's a maybe? YORK: Listen, it's going to happen. The idea of holding and making a study of this change is just a prelude to actually doing it. And the difference between now and what happened in the past is a change in corporate America. Not only is the NFL a giant business that is opposed to the name, by FedEx, the company which purchased the naming rights to the Redskins stadium now has made it very clear it wants the name changed. It would lose other sponsorships as well, so this is going to happen. EMANUEL: Julie, your thoughts? PACE: This isn't just public sentiment changing. There's been a lot of pressure on the Redskins for a lot of years to take this step. I think a lot of this is about money. When you start to lose sponsors, including the naming sponsor of your stadium, when they start to say we are not comfortable with this name, the ownership really, I don't think, has any choice moving forward. EMANUEL: And Marc, it sounds like a new name could be new merchandise and old gear could be retro, and so probably a lot of money to be made if you change, right? THIESSEN: Yes, well, this is being done for the woke mob, not for the Native-Americans. The \"Washington Post\" had a poll in 2016, 90 percent of Native-Americans are not offended by the Redskins name, 80 percent wouldn't be offended if you came up and called them a redskin to their face even if you were not a Native-American. So this is not being done for the Native- American. It's being done for the mob that is tearing down the statues and terrorizing the entire country. And you know what, they're coming after the Chicago Blackhawks and they're coming after the Atlanta Braves and they're coming after the Kansas City Chiefs next. So this is only the beginning. EMANUEL: Sorry, I got a little excited about Candidate Casino. Let's go there. All right, the Joe Biden Veep-stakes. Byron where is your money going? YORK: Look, I think the big question is whether the Democratic base will be happy with all-white ticket. My guess is they will not, so I'm still high on Kamala Harris with $40. If they're OK with that, Elizabeth Warren next with $20. Val Demings and Keisha Lance Bottoms with $15, and Tammy Duckworth, a possibility at $10. EMANUEL: Julie, where's your money going? PACE: I'm with Byron that I think there's a lot of focus on some of the African-American women who are in contention. I've got $40 on Kamala Harris who seems to be leading the pack right now, $20 on Val Demings, and $20 on Keisha Lance Bottoms, the mayor of Atlanta, $20 on Elizabeth Warren, though, still really hanging on and a favorite of a lot of liberals in the Democratic Party. EMANUEL: And Marc? THIESSEN: So I'm also agreeing with everybody it's probably going to be an African-American woman. I put 50 on the person who I think it should be, which is Val Demings because Joe Biden needs to reach both the base and the swing voters and get them both excited. Val Demings was an impeachment manager, she's an African-American, she's popular with the police, but she's also a former police chief, and that would strengthen Joe Biden's message that he's a moderate who is not for dismantling the police. I also put down $20 on Kamala Harris, $20 on Susan Rice, and $10 on Keisha Lance Bottoms. EMANUEL: All right, if it's Friday, that means it's time for Winners and Losers. Byron, you go. YORK: Winner is Janis Shinwari who for eight years was a translator for American troops in Afghanistan, credited with saving at least five American lives, all while being targeted by the Taliban, became a U.S. citizen this week, a very happy even for everyone involved. The loser is Ghislaine Maxwell, Jeffrey Epstein's girlfriend, procurer, close associate for years. Now she's been arrested, and we might finally learn more about what Epstein did with some of his very rich and very powerful friends. EMANUEL: Let's go to Julie, winners and losers? PACE: So my winner this week is the Biden campaign. All the polls are moving in the direction, big fundraising week. Of course, you don't want to be the winner in July. You want to be the winner in November, so a lot of time to go in that race. My loser, fireworks. I love fireworks. Cancelled across so much of the country this holiday weekend. EMANUEL: Marc, take it away. THIESSEN: My winner is the U.S. economy, creating 4.8 million jobs in the last month. That's 20 times -- that's not only a record. That's 20 times the normal rate in an expansion. We're going to have 20 to 30 percent economic growth. Donald Trump is going to be riding a big economic wave into the reelection campaign. And my loser Joe Biden because he was downplaying the good economic news. America has been through so much. We've been through race riots, we've been through a pandemic, we've been through the worst economy since the Great Depression, and we get some good news, and Joe Biden says don't celebrate. Give me a break. EMANUEL: All right, panel, thanks very much, an action-packed week. When we come back, this week's \"Notable Quotables.\" (COMMERCIAL BREAK) EMANUEL: Finally tonight, it is Friday, so that means this week's \"Notable Quotables.\" (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, (R) PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: If you don't have confidence, you're not going to do very well. MAYOR BILL DE BLASIO, (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: The vast majority of New Yorkers want safety, and they want respect from NYPD officers. They don't want to see any bias, and we're going to strike that balance, and I think this budget helps us do it. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Let's mark the date on the calendar and how long it's going to be before we'll have that conversation about New Yorkers crying out for more police. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Today we announced the arrest of one of the villains in this investigation. She had slithered away to a gorgeous property in New Hampshire. DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES: \u00a0The numbers speak for themselves. I'n very concerned and I'm not satisfied which what's going because we are going on the wrong direction. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: People need to treat this like a hurricane, a hurricane is coming to my community. TRUMP: I had asked a mask on, I sort of liked the way I looked. I looked like the Lone Ranger. JOE BIDEN, (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I can hardly wait to compare my cognitive capability to the cognitive capability of the man I'm running against. KAYLEIGH MCENANY, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: This president, I'll tell you, is the most informed person on planet earth when it comes to the threats that we face. MIKE POMPEO, SECRETARY OF STATE: There are many folks using the Taliban or who have used the Taliban over years and years and years as proxy forces. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Right? It don't smell right. TRUMP: Nobody is going to shatter the American dream. God bless America. (END VIDEO CLIP) EMANUEL: Amen. Another wild week in the world of news, and it's not over yet. President Trump will speak tonight from Mount Rushmore and 10:00 p.m. eastern time. We will of course have complete live coverage. Following that I will be back for \"FOX News at Night.\" Tomorrow, starting at 6:00 p.m. eastern right here on FOX News we will bring you President Trump's \"Salute to American\" celebration. And be sure to join me this Sunday when I sit in for Chris Wallace on \"FOX News Sunday.\" Among our guests, Labor Secretary Eugene Scalia. I'll also speak about the spike in coronavirus cases across the country with the director of the Harvard Global Health Institute, Dr. Ashish Jha. Thanks for inviting us into your home tonight.

Others considering it. We're similarly following developments in North Carolina, where we're told that schools will reopen in the fall, but with some caveats, also following developments in a host of other states that are playing kind of loosey- goosey with this, a mix of in-person classes, virtual classes. Bottom line, the president has said that he wants to see all schools reopen in the fall. It is now a given, at the very least, that some of the more populated school districts across the country will not heed his wishes. Welcome, everybody. I'm Neil Cavuto. And this is YOUR WORLD. Let's go to Jonathan Serrie with the latest on this, as well as the latest case count that has really spurred all this -- Jonathan. JONATHAN SERRIE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: It has, indeed, Neil. North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper's announcement came just within the past hour. He says that all students, regardless of whether they're kindergarten or as old as 12th grade, they're going to have to wear masks and social distance if they return to physical school buildings in the hall -- in the fall. As far as his plans for reopening, he really envisions a hybrid plan. Here's what he said: (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. ROY COOPER (D-NC): Today, we announced that North Carolina schools will be open for both in-person and remote learning, with key safety precautions to protect the health of our students, teachers, staff, and families. (END VIDEO CLIP) SERRIE: Later in the show, we will be hearing from the superintendent of the nation's second largest school district. The Los Angeles Unified School District has decided to stick with online instruction, as that city's positive test rate for coronavirus approaches 10 percent. That's twice the World Health Organization's maximum safe threshold for communities to reopen. But in neighboring Orange County, the school board voted to recommend schools reopen in the fall without mandates for face coverings or social distancing. And, in Detroit, protesters blocked school buses, as that city begins summer classes this week. New York City plans to offer a hybrid of both in- person and online learning in the fall. Four former CDC directors are criticizing the Trump administration for undermining federal health officials' recommendations on reopening schools and the economy. In a Washington Post op-ed today, they write: \"These repeated efforts to subvert sound public health guidelines introduce chaos and uncertainty, while unnecessarily putting lives at risk.\" Neil, you may recall, last week, President Trump tweeted that the CDC's guidance for school openings was -- quote -- \"very tough and expensive\" -- back to you. CAVUTO: Thank you, my friend, very much, Jonathan Serrie. We're going to be getting the read from the White House momentarily how the president is responding to this. In the meantime, I want to go to Austin Beutner, the L.A. Unified District superintendent. Superintendent, thank you for taking the time. What are you going to do? How does the fall look to you right now? AUSTIN BEUTNER, SUPERINTENDENT, LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT: \u00a0Thanks for having me. We're going to start online, because that's where health and safety take us. As your colleague mentioned, the rate of infection in our community is twice the World Health Organization guidelines for opening a community. So we have got to start there. And we know it's a struggle. We know we're balancing three sometimes conflicting objectives, the learning needs of students, the impact the virus is having on working families and the communities we serve, and the health and safety of all in the school community. We have to put health and safety first. CAVUTO: So, when the president says that districts that are not doing this, or states or locales that are not opening up are doing it politically and it's all politically motivated, what do you want to tell him? BEUTNER: We have got to get out of the politics and get into the realm of solving the solution, solving the problem, which is, we all want to be back in schools as soon as possible. We know where that's the best learning occurs. Whether that's the White House or here in Los Angeles, I think we could all agree on that. Let's focus on where the federal government can help get us back to school quicker. And if we look at examples around the world, they have done three things well. They have changed health practice in schools. They will spread the desks apart, wear the masks, put down the painter's tape, so people don't bump into each other in the hall, clean surfaces. That's been talked about a lot. The other two pieces, the other two legs of the stool are testing and contact tracing. And we think, until that's done in schools, it's going to keep us from getting back. But, if we do it, we can get back safer and quicker. CAVUTO: Superintendent, if the governor had not reimposed some restrictions on businesses and bars, indoor dining, on that sort of thing, would you have moved to delay the in-person school year? BEUTNER: Yes, we arrived at our decision, actually, before he made that announcement. We have been tracking the health factors for the last month or so. Back in May, it looked better. There was less incidence in the community. We were below the World Health Organization threshold. Since June, it's really skyrocketed, now being twice that threshold. So we have known for a period of weeks we're headed towards this point. Now that we see clear data, we made the decision. But we actually made that before the governor imposed the further restrictions on businesses. CAVUTO: Superintendent, we're learning today that New Hampshire, New Jersey and North Carolina all plan to open for in-person classes. I believe the North Carolina governor did leave open the possibility that districts, municipalities that feel otherwise, are uncomfortable with that, or dealing -- I'm paraphrasing here, sir -- a spike in cases and the like, that they can go the virtual route. But they are trying the in-person route first. You are not. Is it -- is it just a sense that the kids, it's a danger for them, it's a danger their exposure to teachers and administrators, the risk of them bringing it back home? What cinched it for you? BEUTNER: Well, just a couple things to mention. First is, this is a local disease that happens locally. So, the conditions in New Hampshire and North Carolina may be different than here in Los Angeles. If we were having this conversation in May or early June, I'd say, all systems go, we're going to be back in school facilities. It's now July, mid-July, and that has changed. The facts and circumstances have changed here in Los Angeles. The other thing that we're learning is more and more science and data becomes available to us. There was a study done on a village, a town in Italy; 15,000 people were all tested because they quarantined the whole village. Of those who tested positive, half of them showed no symptoms. That's a wakeup call for all of us that we have got to get that testing in place, because, even if we were to reopen facilities in a congregant setting and bring back multiple generations, a 10-year-old student with a 30-year-old teacher and a 50-year-old bus driver, going home to a 7-year-old grandmother, before we do that, we got to make sure that we're keeping all who may have the virus out of the school community. That includes those who show no symptoms, and testing is the only way to do that. CAVUTO: Mr. Beutner, thank you very much for taking the time, Austin Beutner, the L.A. Unified School superintendent. I want to go to the White House now in reaction to all of this. The president, as you know, has not been a fan of any school system that toys with the possibility of delaying the start of the in-person school year. Now you have three very big ones in Atlanta and, of course, Los Angeles right now that are saying -- San Diego as well -- we're not so sure about that. We're going to push things back. Kristin Fisher at the White House now with all the goings on there -- Kristin. KRISTIN FISHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Yes, well, despite those developments in California, the state's two largest school districts saying they are going to go online only in August, the White House is really continuing to push that all schools reopen for in-person classes this fall. And, right now, the vice president, Mike Pence, is in Louisiana making that case. He did wear a mask today, as his did almost everybody else that he was with, except for when he was speaking, which is important, because cases of coronavirus are on the rise there. And the point that the vice president was making is that, remember, New Orleans saw that really early surge in cases. It was one of the original hot spots. They were able to flatten or at least bend the curve. And the vice president said today that he believes that they will be able to bend it back down for a second time. As for schools, the vice president said that the governor of Louisiana informed us today that the plan in that state is to reopen schools on time. The vice president was joined by several members of the Coronavirus Task Force, the education secretary, Betsy DeVos. Dr. Birx was also there. But one key member of the Coronavirus Task Force was not there, Dr. Anthony Fauci. He is going to be speaking to students at Georgetown University in just a few minutes. And, yesterday, he was making the case that he believes an entire shutdown is not necessary, but he believes that, in order to reopen safely, there does need to be a little bit of a pullback. Listen here. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, NIAID DIRECTOR: I am really confident we can, if we step back. You don't necessarily need to shut down again, but pull back a bit, and then proceed in a very prudent way of observing the guidelines of going from step to step. (END VIDEO CLIP) FISHER: Meanwhile, you have the former Vice President and the president's 2020 opponent Joe Biden giving a big speech today on the economy. But he also really pushed back on the president's plan for not just reopening the country, but reopening schools this fall. Watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOSEPH BIDEN (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Mr. President, open everything now isn't a strategy for success. It's barely a slogan. Quit pushing the false choice between protecting our health and protecting our economy. All it does is endanger our recovery on both fronts. (END VIDEO CLIP) FISHER: So, Neil, it's going to be very interesting to see if President Trump decides to respond to some of those attacks from the former Vice President Joe Biden when President Trump speaks in the Rose Garden. That is set for 5:00 p.m., Neil. CAVUTO: All right, Kristin, thank you very much, Kristin Fisher at the White House. We will be monitoring those developments as well. Just a quick peek give, before we take a break, corner of Wall and Broad. It wasn't this confusion over school reopenings that had folks buying today. It was the promise of vaccines and treatments, no fewer than at least 15 of them either paired with other companies or governments, one showing such promise that it could be available by the fall. We're on that, also on top of the other big story gripping the nation, the continued violence in America's cities, two big ones on the West Coast that have a lot of folks wondering, will it ever end? After this. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) CAVUTO: If you're a foreign student and here in the United States, and you're studying at colleges online, and you're worried about the president's directive issued a little more than a week ago that he might be inclined to kick you out, you can relax. He relented a little bit. The president outlining his plan right now that he will not be doing that for international college students to leave the U.S. if they're still in the middle of their classes, whether they're online or not. He might detail that a little bit more when he addresses reporters in about 45 minutes. Separately, we were telling you right now about the spike in cases, particularly in Florida, which, in a lot of people's eyes, has made Miami suddenly the new Wuhan. That might be a bit of a stretch. But at Miami Beach, they're not taking any chances and, officially, as of today, prohibiting short-term rentals. Now, separately, we will have the mayor of the town of Miami, different from Miami Beach, what he makes of this and these other developments, where they're limiting beach access and social distancing amid these new waves of cases that are going on there. So, it -- these are pretty powerful developments. Then there's the issue of violence in this country, more an issue out West with what's been happening in Seattle and now in Portland. Jonathan Hunt on some very big ones that have police concerned this is getting out of control -- Jonathan. JONATHAN HUNT, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Neil, clashes between police and protesters in Portland last night came during what is the seventh consecutive week of demonstrations in the city. Police said rocks, bottles and ball bearings were thrown at them. They threatened to use tear gas to disperse the crowd, but did not ultimately need to do so. In a separate incident northeast of Seattle, two police officers were involved in a traffic stop. When backup officers arrived, they found that two colleagues had both been shot. One of those to die. The other was treated at a hospital and has now been released. Neither has been identified at this point. The suspect was arrested several hours later. Now, according to the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund, 70 officers have died in the line of duty in 2020, up to July 13. That's down 14 percent from the same period in 2019. Thirty of those killed this year died in firearms incidents, one more than the 29 killed over the same period in 2019. Twenty-seven died in traffic-related accidents, 13 due to other causes. Now, it's worth noting, Neil, that the Officers Memorial Fund keeps a separate tally of those officers who've died as a result of exposure to COVID-19 in the line of duty. That number currently stands at 63, making coronavirus, according to the Memorial Fund, by far the leading cause of law enforcement deaths in 2020 -- Neil. CAVUTO: Thank you, my friend, very, very much. In the meantime, I want to go right now to Mike Solan. He's the Seattle Police Officers Guild president, joining us now via Skype. Mike, it doesn't seem to ease up in your town. And I'm wondering now, efforts to cut the police budget, and maybe substantially, in Seattle, if that's really helping matters any. MIKE SOLAN, PRESIDENT, SEATTLE POLICE OFFICERS GUILD: Hey, Neil. Thanks for having me on again. No, it's absolutely making things worse. And the socialist-leaning city council has our entire reasonable community, which I now referred to as the ignored majority of the citizens of Seattle, hostage by their unreasonable activism. Now they're talking about removing funding 50 percent of us, which would remove two-thirds of the police jobs, which would make the CHOP or CHAZ, if you want to refer to that situation, basically child's play to what kind of crime would besiege our entire city. And you could just imagine what we're all feeling at this point, due to our job security at this point. So it's a very troubling time. And I hope people across this nation realize that Seattle is leading the way as far as how public safety will be conducted coming to you. It's very troubling. CAVUTO: And it is playing out across the country, whether people are fond of the police or not. It's no coincidence there's been an uptick in more violence right now, as there's an all-out assault on police budgets. I'm just wondering, in New York, where they have pared a billion from the police budget, now they're looking to pare more -- obviously, you're familiar with what's going on in Seattle. This is playing out in no fewer than 23 U.S. cities. What's going on? SOLAN: And this has been -- yes, it's a national trend, and it's basically socialism on steroids. It's not at our doorstep anymore. They have breached the door and they're coming through. And please understand that this must be stopped. America needs to wake up as to what is occurring. And if we lose 50 percent of our department, we're talking 1,100 officers gone. Who's left to answer the 911 call to investigate that child rape? You can just imagine. So, please, I understand that if people -- people need to get involved. This ignored majority across our city, and, more importantly, across our nation need to rise up. And if you want to get involved, please assist at = . Please stand up to this unreasonable socialist activism. CAVUTO: I don't know what's going on in Seattle. Mike. I'm familiar with what's happening in New York City, where better than 400 officers have already requested retirement. Some of them are eligible for it, but had held off on it. Now they're flooding the system with such requests. But we're similarly seeing new rookie classes being pared down, frustration over whether it's a good thing to even be a police officer these days. What do you make of all this? SOLAN: Well, I make of it it's dividing us more than uniting us. I mean, we're definitely having people that are retiring early here, looking for jobs elsewhere. But, more importantly, Neil, is that the defund movement is based upon how they view as law enforcement, which they do not respect anymore. And, more importantly, there's a certain city council member that heads the public safety chair on our council that is looking at the possibility of, when officers are terminated or furloughed, based upon this 50 percent cut, they want to dictate those cuts based upon the person's race, which is astronomically, horrifically bad, which violates all laws and just common sense. But that's where we are. That's the level of insanity that we're plagued with by this unreasonable, activist city council that has our ignored majority hostage. And it's very troubling. And you can just imagine the mental health that's impacting our officers is at an all-time high. And you know that suicides by police officers are all -- at the highest level they have ever been. And you can just imagine, with all the protests we have had to deal with, the assaults, the amount of vitriol that was plagued against our membership, now we're dealt with this defund movement, which is national now, which is all socialist-backed propaganda and well-funded, is now we have to deal with this as far as losing our jobs. So, the hits just keep on coming. But I need America rise up here. The ignored majority needs to wake up as to what's occurring. CAVUTO: Mike, thank you very, very much. I always hate talking under these circumstances, but I learn a lot, Mike Solan, the Seattle Police Officers Guild president. Just to keep you up, there are a lot of unintended consequences to the type of violence Mike was outlining, including innocent people caught in the crossfire, and the latest example in New York, a 1-year-old little boy -- after this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0 UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I can't hear him calling me daddy no more. I can't kiss him no more. I can't play with him no more. I can't do nothing with him no more. Like, I have got to put my -- I got to put my son in the ground now. (END VIDEO CLIP) (COMMERCIAL BREAK) CAVUTO: All right, you might want to add Dr. Anthony Fauci to the list of those concerned about putting off kids being in person for school, saying in Georgetown that to keep children in school, because of the impact of keeping children out, that's what's important -- after this. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DAVELL GARDNER SR., FATHER OF SHOOTING VICTIM: I got to put my son in the ground now. And he's only 1, his birthday, two months -- in two months. He didn't live to see 2. Like, he didn't live life. And it's like I wanted to get him out this violence before something like this happened. SAMANTHA GARDNER, GRANDMOTHER OF SHOOTING VICTIM: For the cowards that did this, you should be ashamed of yourself because everybody talk about black lives matter. What about baby lives? (END VIDEO CLIP) CAVUTO: Lawrence Jones has been talking about this for weeks now. When it comes to black lives matter, which matter? Shouldn't they all matter? He joins us right now. Lawrence, this case is particularly shocking, because it's a 1-year-old boy caught up in the crossfire, both literally and figuratively, and now dead. For what, right? For what? LAWRENCE JONES, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Neil, I reported last week about Chicago, what is happening in there. And right now, we're seeing it hit right home here in New York City. Crime, when it comes to shooting, are up 130 percent. I just got some new numbers from the sources, and they say now it's up to 161 percent. This kid was in a stroller when he was gunned down in the middle of a fight. And they still haven't been able to catch the suspects, because no one in the community is talking. Neil, as I continue to say on the network -- and I have been very vocal when it comes to the state abusing its power -- when police get it wrong, I'm on the network reporting on it, getting all the facts. But when an innocent young black life is taken from us, I have to report on that too. And the fact that you're not seeing outrage across the country is concerning to me. Just because this happened in the projects, just because these people were in a poor neighborhood does not mean they're not entitled to life and the same liberties that our audience and people that are in rich neighborhoods are entitled to. CAVUTO: Now that dad to bury a little boy. And I'm wondering. Given everything that's going on, does he blame anyone? Is he just overwhelmed? Does he just think, how did this get so bad so quickly? What? JONES: Well, the dad and the grandmother blame the political leadership. And it's not about a partisan issue. It's the fact that the elected leaders aren't doing anything to prevent this from happening. The AOCs of the world say that this crime is happening because of the coronavirus. Well, that's just simply not true. The crime has been happening in these neighborhoods for a while. And people aren't doing anything about it. The elected leaders don't care about the death, poverty and destruction that have been happening in these communities for a long time. Neil, I don't just talk about these cities, Philly, Detroit, Chicago, New York City. I go to these cities and I talk with the people. And they're begging -- they don't care what ideology you believe in -- for someone to stop the bleeding. And you know what? Neither political party has been able to do it. You got the Democrats that run these neighborhoods. They have failed on it. And then you have the Republicans that don't show up to help solve the problem. So, again, they don't want a political solution. They want a human solution. And I think everybody should care about all of these black lives. CAVUTO: And, as you pointed out, Lawrence, the other day, I mean, this is not an isolated incident. Violent crimes, homicides are up better than 118 percent just over the last six weeks in the New York metropolitan area, up about 70-plus percent in Chicago. It's playing out again and again. And it seems to be spreading. I just talked to a Seattle police chief, who is very concerned about budget cuts there, and how it's going to lead, and has already led to more violence there. This does seem to be permeating the nation. JONES: Well, I will tell you this, Neil. You know me. I'm a libertarian. I'm not ashamed of my ideology. And I believe in cutting. But it doesn't make any sense to cut from the police department when crime is a problem. There's a bunch of other line items that they can cut from right now. If they could point to results by cutting from the police department, then I would be for it. But, right now, it hasn't bared much fruit. You got a billion dollars that has been cut from the New York Police Department. And right now, crime is skyrocketing, especially when it comes to violent crime. So, again, I asked the mayor, is there anything -- maybe look at your wife's proposals that she's gotten. And they're getting millions and millions of dollar. Cut from those areas. But don't come from a police department that is already underwhelmed -- overwhelmed by crime. There are so many unsolved cases currently. Yesterday, just by the numbers, 18 people were shot, one person was killed in New York. Those crimes have not been solved. So, again, does it make sense to continue to cut from a police department that is already begging for more help? CAVUTO: Lawrence Jones, thank you, my friend. I appreciate it, and the insight. JONES: Thanks, brother. CAVUTO: We will keep track of this, because it is spreading everywhere, and the numbers are numbing. All right, when we also come back, Senator Rand Paul will be joining us, talking about what's going on right now, the latest push for stimulus in Washington. He's not a fan of some of the numbers he's been hearing -- after this. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) CAVUTO: All right, there is more stimulus coming. We can tell you that. We don't know how much, but we do know that more is on the way. And maybe by the end of the summer, it will all be put together. Here's the thing, though. We don't have any money to pay for it. In the most recent month of June, we were spending $864 billion more than we were taking in. In other words, the deficit for just one month was $864 billion. It's a familiar theme in what is now increasingly looking like at least a $3 trillion annual deficit. And that might be conservative. Blake Burman on what this could mean going forward. Hey, Blake. BLAKE BURMAN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Hi there, Neil. On that one month of June, just to put that in perspective, more than some fiscal years in total, fiscal years in recent memory. In any event, that eye-popping numbers is not going to slow down the White House as it relates to putting out a phase four relief proposal here, if not in the upcoming days, certainly in the upcoming weeks. The White House spokesperson, Judd Deere, sending me this statement this afternoon, saying -- quote -- \"The White House is sensitive to the rising deficit, which certainly furthers the president's priority that any phase four package be targeted, and one that advances pro-growth policies and incentivizes reemployment.\" The top Republican on the House Ways and Means Committee is Kevin Brady, spoke with you earlier today on \"Cavuto Coast to Coast.\" He continued to tout this idea of a reemployment bonus, which is popular among many Republicans here in Washington. Watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. KEVIN BRADY (R-TX): We know then when unemployment benefits end, the people tend to look for work pretty aggressively. And, right now, we know mainstream businesses are having trouble getting their workers to come back. I do you think a return-to-work bonus or some economic incentive to reconnect those workers is important for both them and that business in a key way. (END VIDEO CLIP) BURMAN: So that's what Republicans are talking about. But Democrats here in Washington are pushing for an extension of that $600 unemployment insurance benefit, that federal plus-up that expires at the end of the month, certainly possible that both sides could meet in the middle. The House speaker, Neil, by the way, Nancy Pelosi, said today that if there is not a deal before Congress takes its summer break in August, that traditional August recess, then she would be in favor of keeping the House here in Washington, before letting them skip town for the entirety of the month. Bottom line here. Neil, both sides hoping to get a deal in the upcoming weeks -- Neil. CAVUTO: All right. Thank you, my friend, Blake Burman, outside the White House reporting on all of that. Let's go to Senator Rand Paul on this. Of course, he's quite a fiscal hawk when it comes to such matters. And that generally gets the ire of even some in his party. So, it's a good time to ask him about this latest stimulus push. What do you think, Senator? Are you for more stimulus? SEN. RAND PAUL (R-KY): Well, we have no money, Neil. There's no rainy day fund. There's no savings account. It's not like we go over to the Federal Reserve, open the safe, and we find out, oh, we have all this money we can give to people. The $3 trillion we have already sent to people because of this government mandated depression has been borrowed. Where are they going to get another trillion dollars? They're going to borrow it. And so I think it's a really, really rotten thing to do. What you have to do is look at the source. The source of the economic depression is the government and the government shutdown of the economy. The government, and particularly the governors, need to get out of the way, let the economy open up, and let individuals assess their risk and act accordingly. CAVUTO: So, when there's talk about extending unemployment benefits, which are very generous on the federal level, or what some of your Republican colleagues have come up with, an incentive to get people to go back to work, you're against both? PAUL: Well, if you pay people not to work, they won't work. If you pay people more not to work than they get for working normally, they won't work. It's called institutional unemployment. So, right now, the institutional unemployment, if you make less than about $50,000 a year, you have got no business working. Why work if the government will give you a free $50,000? If the Democrats get their way, and unemployment goes on for months and months and months, if not years, what will happen is, nobody will work for less than $50,000 in this country, because you can get that for not working. The Republicans' idea, only slightly less stupid. The Republicans are going to give you a bonus to go back to work. Well, where are they getting the money? They're going to borrow it from you. They're going to borrow it from your kids. They're going to borrow it from China. It's a ridiculous notion that we just keep passing out money. Let's get rid of the root cause of this depression. Sometimes, we don't know exactly the cause of the depression. In this one, we do know the cause, the government. The government shut the economy down. The government needs to get the hell out of the way and let us all go back to work, and let each and every one of us assess the risk and make decisions accordingly. CAVUTO: Senator, you're also a doctor. And many school districts and municipalities, including some big ones, Los Angeles and San Diego and Atlanta, are among those saying, we're going to delay the school year because we don't like the spike in cases we're seeing. We think it's risky. So, we're going to put it off. How do you feel about that? PAUL: Well, the teachers union in California also said they won't go back to work until we defund the police and have Medicare for all. So, we have to put this into a bit of perspective. But what I would say is, the media have been scaring people to death. The mortality for children 0 to 18 is one in a million or less. The mortality between 18 years of age and 45 is about 10 in 100,000. So, we need to assess those risks and make decisions. The countries that have opened schools -- 22 countries have opened schools in Europe, and they're doing just fine. They haven't had a surge. The other interesting thing is, when you do contact -- contact tracing, in China, the Netherlands, Britain and in Iceland, what you find is, kids not only rarely get this, rarely die from it, but they rarely transmit it. They're just not good transmitters. And, in general, people who are asymptomatic are not good transmitters. So, the day cares stayed open in New York throughout this for doctors' kids, nurses' kids, hospital janitors' kids, anybody that was associated, firemen, police. The day care stayed open. CAVUTO: Right. PAUL: And guess what? Had very little coronavirus and very few staff members -- about 1 percent of staff members were infected. And most of these staff members, if they're in a reasonable age group, are at very, very low risk of succumbing to this disease. CAVUTO: Well, actually, that puts you kind of on the same page as Dr. Fauci. I know two had your disagreements. He is for opening schools in person. But he did say this about , I guess, an answer to a question about whether he's being slighted by the White House. He said: \"You can trust respected medical authorities. I believe I'm one of them. So, you can trust me. But you need to stick to the data, the science, medical authorities who have a track record of telling the truth. The public can get mixed messages and get confused.\" What do you think of that? PAUL: Well, look, I think Dr. Fauci is well-intentioned. I don't think he's a bad person. I think he wants what's best for the country. But his perspective is that of someone who's always worked for the government and never worked outside of government. So, there's a Dr. Scott Atlas, who is a professor at Stanford, as part of the Hoover Institute, who has a much different and I think much more reasoned perspective. So, what we do is, we listen to a lot of these people. But, ultimately, if we're going to live in a free country, none of these people should get to make a decision for us, for us individually. Each individual should assess the risks and make their choices. Frankly, if you're 18 years old, the rules should be or the advice should be much different than if you're 80 years old, and if you're in a nursing home and you're 85 years old. And so it isn't one-size-fits-all. We can't say, oh, everybody needs to stay at home because someone at the nursing home might get sick. No, let's try to be careful and protect those in the nursing home, but let's open the economy, open the schools. There's a possibility -- and we don't know this yet -- but there's a possibility that this great spike in infections that we're seeing throughout the South, that it may well be enhancing immunity. And it may well be that they reach what I think New York has already reached, a point at which the disease will begin to burn itself out. Interestingly, no one's saying this, but it may not be herd immunity of 60 percent. It may be a break point for the disease that's much less than that. And there are mathematicians who look at this, and they say that the models of herd immunity are based on random behavior and random vaccination. When you get herd immunity from the disease, it's not randomly distributed. And you have some who are very social and some who are less social. But the bottom line is, historically, diseases and viruses have burnout at 25 percent immunity, when you look back at our past. No one knows what the future holds, but I tend to be optimistic that we might get to 20, 25 percent immunity, and the disease may be -- we may be well over -- may be able to overcome the disease at that point. CAVUTO: Very quickly, we will be talking to the mayor of Miami. Now, it's Miami Beach that has already put out a proviso no short-term rentals here, fearing that the thing is -- it's worsening. It's different from Miami, I grant you, but do you think that is an overreaction? PAUL: I think we don't know until we see the death rate. I think that infection rate and testing are complicated, whether things are going up or down. CAVUTO: Right. PAUL: I do believe they are going up and people are infected. Even in my town here, Bowling Green in Kentucky, we meet people every day who are infected. And, to a person, they're all getting better. They're getting mild disease and getting better. So, if they're -- if this is a mild disease in Miami, don't shut it down. If you have an increase in your death rate, and it's significant, maybe you should. CAVUTO: All right. PAUL: But, so far, Florida's doing way better than New York. You wouldn't know that if you watch CNN, but Florida is doing way better than New York. New York had a disaster, a public policy disaster, public health disaster in their nursing homes, due to Democrat Governor Cuomo's decisions. Florida is doing a lot better. But you won't get that from the media that has become so biased and cannot report any of this objectively. CAVUTO: All right. PAUL: It's a disaster. CAVUTO: Senator Rand Paul, thank you very much. I believe the senator was referring to total cases, total hospitalizations, total deaths. Now, when we come back again, the move in Miami Beach right now, not only shut down those beaches, but also prevent people from coming down there for short-term vacation rentals. The mayor of Miami, separate from the beach, on what he makes of that -- after this. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) CAVUTO: All right, first the beaches, and now Miami Beach is telling short-term renters, better luck next time. We really don't want any short- term rentals. So, if you're looking at it, cancel it now. Francis Suarez is the mayor of Miami, again, separate from Miami Beach here. He joins us right now. Mayor, always good to have you. What do you think of this move? Is it justified? FRANCIS SUAREZ (R), MAYOR OF MIAMI, FLORIDA: I think the reason why they're doing it is because South Beach attracts a lot of tourists. And it's very, very difficult to control the crowds. There's large crowds of people... CAVUTO: Right. SUAREZ: ... that are gathered together. So, the whole idea of social distancing kind of goes out the window in South Beach. And I think that's what they're trying to get ahold of. CAVUTO: Do you support a move like that? It's a little different in your neck of the woods. Are you, as well, looking at those who might be coming to your city for a vacation, short- term rentals and the like, that you would consider the same? SUAREZ: Yes, I think, for us, we're always looking at -- and one of the things we have in our city is sort of underground parties, where, basically, bars have been closed by order of the governor. And we see people that basically try to create, recreate a bar in a warehouse. And so we shut down two of those this weekend. We shut down about 10 businesses over the weekend. So, we have been trying to dramatically enforce or increase our enforcement to make sure that, you know, things don't get worse in the city, which is obviously seeing -- and in Dade County, which is obviously seeing record number of cases over the last few days. CAVUTO: You know, Mayor, the greater Miami area has been compared to sort of like the new Wuhan, the new hotbed area of the virus. Do you think that's fair? SUAREZ: You know, that was one of the epidemiologists down here that said that. I think that was -- I don't know if she said that as an epidemiological opinion, expert opinion. But I think -- I think there was 50,000 cases a day in Wuhan. We're nowhere near that, obviously. We're at 3,500. CAVUTO: Right. SUAREZ: I think, in New York, you had a death rate that was at 8 percent. Our death rate is somewhere in the 2 percent range, and our death rate has been stable. We do have an issue with our hospitals very, very close to or very nearing capacity. And we are trying to create more capacity. And we do -- we may have to take some dramatic measures, if things don't improve over the next few weeks. And that's something that we're hoping that we can all together -- we had the governor today. We just came from a meeting with the governor and with all the mayors -- or all the major mayors of major cities -- of many of the major cities in Dade County, so that we can at least communicate whatever we're going to do with one message, because I think it is very important for us to communicate clearly and coherently one message, so that people will follow it. CAVUTO: Are you for kids going back to school in Miami this fall in person? SUAREZ: You know, we had a big discussion about that just a few minutes ago. Right now, obviously, we have a tremendously high amount of cases. I can tell you, personally, my daughter is still not school-ready. So she's not going to be going to school. And, actually, she could have been going into preschool. And my wife is thinking of holding her back. My son, who's 6, will probably do virtual learning, if things don't get better. But there are many families in our community that are in lower income, and they may not have another choice to be able to not send their kids to school, if they want to work. So, right now, what I have understood so far is that parents will be given an option as to whether their kids can go to school or not. That may change, given the circumstances. Obviously, schools are six weeks away from opening. And that's -- hopefully, we will see a significant improvement before that day comes. CAVUTO: Because the governor, I believe, DeSantis, is still on board with schools reopening for in-person classes, as things stand now. Do you support that? SUAREZ: Yes, he definitely -- he definitely does feel that way. He reiterated that. For me, it's more about the circumstances. I -- today, as of right now, with the cases the way they are, and the fact that we're still in phase one, under the CDC guidelines promulgated by the federal government, schools would not be open. CAVUTO: Right. SUAREZ: So, I think we have to see how things are going to evolve over the next six weeks. I can tell you that, if things don't get better over the next week to four weeks, we're going to have a hospital problem, and we're going to have to potentially consider taking some very extreme measures. So, we're trying to communicate to our residents that this is the time for them to take this seriously, to wear their mask in public, and to distance socially, and wash your hands. And we also are seeing that a large percentage of the transmission is at home, people going back home, from a family member. So, we're also messaging that out, so that people are more careful when they get home, and don't just pretend like they didn't potentially get exposed from the outside. CAVUTO: All right, Mayor, best of luck, and to your two little ones there, as you balance that. You're a parent, too, after all, so you have a lot to juggle. Mayor Suarez, thank you very, very much. SUAREZ: Thank you, Neil. CAVUTO: Just focusing on the White House right now. We're minutes away from a presidential press conference. China will be the big issue right now. We have been getting very in your face with the Chinese right now on a whole host of issues, from Hong Kong, to setting up military installations in islands all across the South China Sea. Our Charlie Gasparino has been following all of this, because trade, I guess, Charlie, hangs in the balance, right? CHARLIE GASPARINO, FOX NEWS SENIOR CORRESPONDENT: Yes, I mean, we're a long way from the phase one victory lap that the Trump administration had before the coronavirus. It's -- we are now at a point where there is all-out trade war with China, and it's war on a number of levels. It's an economic war. It's preventing Chinese companies maybe from operating here, like the music app TikTok, as the Trump administration believes that that music app is taking information from its users, mainly kids, but also social influencers, and giving it to the surveillance part of the Chinese government. The Trump administration really blames the Chinese for the coronavirus outbreak. They're on pretty good ground on that one. So, this is not a good time for Chinese-American relations. I will say this. I find it fascinating that the Democrats are chiming in as well. Joe Biden, if you saw some of his economic plans, it's all about stopping trade with China or limiting trade with China. There is a populist consensus in this country that China has done us wrong with the virus, with other -- with other measures. And I think you're going to see that play out through the election. Both sides see it as fertile ground for voters. And to be honest with you, the Trump administration was the first real -- first time anybody -- any administration called out China so blatantly. No one else did in the past. They deserve credit for that. I'm not saying we should have gone the full tariff route. But we -- but the Trump administration went out there and clearly labeled China as a bad player, as a menace to the world economy. Listen, if there's -- there's no better proof than the coronavirus outbreak, which emanated there. So I think you're going to hear Donald Trump ramp up the rhetoric in this. I mean, clearly, from his economic aides, you could -- I have been speaking with them off the record, but Larry Kudlow has been saying it on the record. This is not a good time for the Chinese -- for Chinese-American relations. I can't imagine they're going to is going to be phase two of a trade deal with them, given just how much animosity is out there. So... (CROSSTALK) CAVUTO: And, by the way, Charlie, you're right on that. Catherine Herridge from CBS was interviewing the president on that subject, and he ruled out a phase two trade deal right now, to your quick point here, because phase one just is going nowhere right now. We're waiting for them to deliver the goods, and they're not, right? Real quick. GASPARINO: Yes. I mean, phase one wasn't that big of a deal anyway. It was supposed to be the setup for phase two. But it's the relationship between the two countries now, which has been totally soured by corona, by further talk of espionage. I mean, all's you have to do is look at a music app TikTok, right? CAVUTO: All right. GASPARINO: It's young -- used by young kids. That may be banned because of this. That shows you how far they're going to go in this war -- Neil, back to you. CAVUTO: Oh, it's out of control. All right, thank you, buddy, Charlie Gasparino. We are waiting to hear from the president on this. He will outline all of these plans. Might be an opportunity for him to respond to questions about all these school systems that are delaying their in-person opening. Now, he said that would be a mistake. He no doubt could use this as an opportunity to emphasize that point.

We begin with a story the media have pounced on for the last 36 hours, President Trump commuting the sentence of his long-time pal and informal advisor, Roger Stone, who was to begin serving a prison term of 40 months next week for lying in the Russia probe. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, UNITED STATES PRESIDENT: Roger Stone was treated horribly. Roger Stone was treated very unfairly. Roger Stone was brought into this witch hunt, this whole political witch hunt in the Mueller scam. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: This is the most corrupt and cronyistic act in, you know, in perhaps all of recent history. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This president continues to use the levers of power and the Justice Department to protect himself and his cronies, punish the people who speak out or try to rein him in. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I think the really president felt as though this was not a fair trial in the District of Columbia. You know, frankly, good luck if you're a friend of Donald Trump trying to get a fair trial there. (END VIDEO CLIP) KURTZ: Joining us now to analyze the coverage, Ben Domenech, founder and publisher of The Federalist, Gillian Turner, a Fox News correspondent here in Washington, and Clarence Page, columnist for the Chicago Tribune. Ben, the White House statement is filled with phrases like Russia hoax. But the media are up in arms over a president keeping out of prison a long-time advisor and self-described dirty trickster whose prosecution Trump's attorney general called righteous. BEN DOMENECH, THE FEDERALIST: Whatever you think of Roger Stone, you don't have to like him. You can think that he's a wacky (Inaudible) or someone who, you know, is a true dirty trickster. I think that you can say that in this case there's a strong argument to be made for over-prosecution. He also, I think in this context, is an elderly individual who was about to go into prison at the time of the Coronavirus and everything intended with that. These are the kinds of cases where we've seen leniency. But honestly, I think that the president would be better off focused on the kind of pardons and the kind of commutations that can actually have an impact on society at large as supposed to looking into his friends. He's used that power far less than prior presidents. In this case, you know, I wish I could have seen this kind of uproar over the President Obama's pardoning, for instance, of unrepentant murderer, Oscar Lopez Rivera and other people who he saw fit to get out of the kind of punishment that its viewed them (ph). In this case, I think though the president was always going to stand by someone who stood by him through thick and thin. KURTZ: Yeah, loyalty a key factor here. And Clarence, the media's broader argument is the president says he's a law and order president of the United States. But when it comes to his people, Mike Flynn, and in this case, Roger Stone, it's often dirty cops, unfair prosecution here. The Justice Department intervene. But I have to say this. I doubt most of the public is as concerned as the pundits about a fringe figure like Stone. CLARENCE PAGE, CHICAGO TRIBUNE SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: I don't think most of the public is as concerned about Stone as the president is. The -- Stone is a long-time friend. The difference between this case and Obama's pardon of Rivera is that Stone is connected for a long time with this president. And this president often personalizes the politics of his office. This is another case of it. That's why I'm sure he'll get on to more significant pardons for the rest of us. But later on, but right now that's where a big part of the attention coming here, as well as even Robert Mueller and Mitt Romney, other Republicans have expressed some disdain over this particular move. KURTZ: Certain Republicans have. Gillian, New York Times headline says Trump goes where Nixon did not during Watergate. And look, the president does argue, as Ben alluded to, that Stone who is 67 who did have a Nixon tattoo on his back at one point, you know, could face a medical risk in jail. And in fairness, the president wiped out the sentence but he didn't pardon him, which leaves the legal finding of guilt. GILLIAN TURNER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Yeah, well, that op-ed you referenced about this being, quote, \"worse than Watergate\" referred to the fact that Republican lawmakers in particular were standing behind the president's decision, even though they allegedly reportedly know that it's corrupt, according to the wording in the piece. And during Watergate, Republicans broke from Nixon. So that's the difference here. On Roger Stone though, particularly, I think as much as journalists profess to loathe him and despise him, he's really their ultimate fantasy. And the fact that he's going to stay out of prison for four years is like their wildest dream come true, because he's going to continue talking to them. Maybe people on the outside don't realize this, but he's in constant contact with journalists. I've probably am not far out when I say that he's on text chains with probably a journalist from every single media outlet in America. If he was in prison, it would be a lot harder to keep that line of communications open. So for a lot of journalists, this is actually a boone to them, the fact that he's going to stay out of prison. KURTZ: Well, Roger Stone hasn't been texting with me. And it was a New York Times news story, by the way, that I was quoting. Ben, Michael Cohen, who unlike the loyal Stone turned on Trump, was just sent back to prison after a COVID-related home release after refusing to sign an agreement that he wouldn't talk to journalists or publish a book that he's working on. And the journalists are saying, well, that's an infringement of his rights, because even if he was in jail he would be allowed to publish a book or talk to journalists. DOMENECH: Well, I think in this case, you know, Cohen was someone who wanted to have the kind of relationship with the media that Gillian attributes to Roger Stone. To Gillian's point, I have to say he actually just showed the other day up on Ryan Long's comedy podcast doing an extensive hour-long interview. So he really is someone who's kind of everywhere. I think in this case Cohen is someone who mishandled that situation. I think he should have gone into that with an attitude toward negotiation as opposed to refusing the deal the way that it was laid out. But certainly, there's no lack of people who want to strike while the iron is hot. Try to get books out. Try to have some relevance as it relates to the election. I think that's what Michael Cohen was attempting to do. KURTZ: All right, Clarence, just briefly, because I want to move to some other subjects. The extraordinarily harsh and personal nature of the media criticism of the president in recent months in the COVID era, shall we say. I wonder whether you think in light of the polling and everything that this is because a lot of pundits have concluded that Donald Trump may lose this election, and so it's OK to pile on. PAGE: Well, the media have a lot of interesting and extraordinary stuff to cover with this president every day. And he's makes a point of making news. Much of it is news he doesn't want to make. But the fact is his polling is down. It's down across the board. He has made some really self-destructive moves, I would say, in regards to COVID. The whole mask issue, whether or not to invite your supporters out to rallies in hot zones like Tulsa. You know, this kind of situation is -- the president doesn't need to have bad press because just regular press covering his moves is enough. KURTZ: Right. Sounds like you might miss him if he's not around. All right, Gillian, The Washington Post is quoting unnamed aids and advisors as saying that Trump is doing a woe is me lament in private that he's been unfairly victimized by the virus, the shutdown, the protests, and rallying against journalists by name. Is this news or is it just private venting by the president? TURNER: Well, it is news in the sense that there's new sources apparently coming forward to report this stuff. But it's not surprising to anybody. The president vents about reporters by name on Twitter every single day, in press conferences. I will also say at this point it's surprising to me that he continues to do it because it's widely acknowledged, you know, in the media. I can only speak for my colleagues and I. But every time the president does that, he elevates journalists. He gives them more exposure. He gives them, in a sense, more power. Because the second he gets somebody in particular in his crosshairs, everybody pays attention to them. Everybody wants to know who they are, what they think. They want to know who their sources are. So it's surprising to me that aides haven't really sort of prevailed upon him to stop doing this and singling people out who he doesn't like by name. Because it really only helps them. KURTZ: Right. I was just making the point that these were private conversations that were leaked. All right, we're short on time. I want to get a quick answer from Ben and Clarence. New tweet by the president, too many universities and school systems are about radical left indoctrination, not education, telling the Treasury Department to re-examine their tax exempt status. Ben, you might agree about the indictment of the schools. But a lot of journalists see this as a kind of a culture war move to aid his re- election. DOMENECH: I do think it's a culture war move. I think that the president recognizes that he's in a culture war. He said that this week, in fact, to Phil Wegmann at RealClearPolitics. This is the reality that he's in. And he is right to identify these universities as being the places that have produced the kind of people who are willing to go out as screaming in the faces of cops and pulling down statues. I do think this is something that is not necessarily the best way to go about attacking those institutions or correcting their ways in lots of different respects. Tax exemptions versus accreditation or something like that. KURTZ: Right. I mean, Clarence, what if a Biden administration decided to go after the tax status of Liberty University or conservative educational institutions? PAGE: Howard, this is a manufactured story. The president hasn't said he's going after tax status. He's threatening to go after the tax exempt status. Remember, he signed an executive order last year in regard to free speech on campus. His position is very clear. So why is he rattling his sword again this time? It's politics. He's playing the culture war. KURTZ: All right. I did want to get to the president telling Sean Hannity that he took a cognitive test at Walter Reed. And he said that the doctors were very surprised. They said that's an unbelievable thing, really. Does anybody do what you just did? But it kind of got drowned out in the news, and we are out of time. So when we come back, the press versus the president in a culture war that includes NASCAR and Confederate flags. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) KURTZ: President Trump and the media are fighting an increasingly nasty culture war which flared up when he tweeted about how NASCAR's only full time black driver, Bubba Wallace, should apologize and that the news incident quote, \" and flag decision has caused the lowest ratings ever.\" The flag decision is the league's new ban on Confederate flags at its events, and the topic totally dominated Kayleigh McEnany's press conference. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: My question is why does the president so supportive of flying the Confederate flag? Does he think it was a mistake for NASCAR to ban the flag? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The president said he wasn't making a judgment on one way or the other. You're focusing on one word at the very bottom of a tweet. That's completely taken out of context and neglecting the complete rush to judgment. (CROSSTALK) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Why would the president not praise NASCAR for removing the Confederate flag? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: What exactly does the president see as positive for uniting about the Confederate flag? (END VIDEO CLIP) KURTZ: Gillian Turner, I've rarely seen a press secretary get hammered on one subject the way that Kayleigh McEnany did. And I think it's because she kept insisting the president has no position on the Confederate flag when the tweet would certainly indicate that he was critical of NASCAR. TURNER: He clearly does have a position on the Confederate flag. And this is not a situation where the press bombarded the press secretary at the briefing because they wanted to. They got dragged into this because President Trump keeps talking about it and keeps tweeting about it. Once he does that, it is their responsibility to bring it up with the press secretary. So let's get the facts straight about the order of these things. This is an unforced error for President Trump. It's a perfect, perfect opportunity for him to stay out of the fray, not make unforced errors here. He didn't have to wade into these waters, getting embroiled in not only the argument about the Confederate flag. But the ongoing argument about race, no -- race in sports, which brings us back to Colin Kaepernick, it would've been a lot cleaner for him messaging- wise if he had just stayed out of it. And then Kayleigh wouldn't have been put in that position at the briefing. KURTZ: Right. And Ben, even some on-air conservatives agreed with the media verdict here, which it made no sense especially after those July 4th speeches that generated so much coverage for the president who suddenly weigh in on NASCAR and Confederate flags. DOMENECH: Well, first off, I have to say. I think we should all feel good about the Bubba Wallace story since it turned out that this was not something that was clearly intentionally done. Like so many other stories that end up looking -- that like, you know racial incidents at first. There was an explanation for this along the same lines as we've seen in other instances such as those ropes hung from a tree out in California. And so I think that's actually a good thing that we should take away from it. In this instance, I think the president always tries to fire away at what he views as political correctness and the problems related to it. But I want to circle back to something that Gillian just said there, which I think is incorrect. The president gave a speech at Mount Rushmore. And the next day, the Washington Post ran a front page article from Bob Costas (ph) and from Phil Rucker that lied that said right off the bat that he had given a speech defending Confederates. And that's something that they didn't correct. They didn't roll back. I think the president is actually engaged in the media on this, because the media continues to try to make this about Confederate statues and Confederate symbols when that's not what's actually being attacked. They're trying to gaslight the country and to turning this into something that is it isn't, which is -- looking at the Confederacy as opposed to attacking the people that are on Mount Rushmore, attacking Christopher Columbus, attacking the whole of America's heritage. And I think the president's very well aware of that. KURTZ: Yeah. Well, I will say there was a lot of red meat, as we've discussed last week, for conservatives into those weekend holiday speeches. But Clarence, I want to come back to this. First of all, even many people on the right say Bubba Wallace has nothing to apologize for, although it turned out the noose incident was not a hate crime. But in her response to reporters, Kayleigh McEnany said why have I not gotten a single question on the weekend surge in murders in New York and Chicago including children. You work for a Chicago newspaper. Isn't that a fair point? PAGE: I think it is not a fair point, because that's not the real story that the president would be involved with. The president had a burr under his saddle for Chicago crime for a long time. But as I have wrote in my weekend column here, what happened to that expert on Chicago crime who was going to solve the whole problem in a week? That was what President Trump promised me and other members of the Tribune editorial board, repeated that on the campaign trail, and has yet to come up with this expert of his on Chicago crime. He loves to grandstand about Chicago crime. This is what we're seeing here again as with the Confederate, as with the Bubba Wallace incident. Ben is right. Bubba Wallace's story is a good news story. President Trump has just lost the narrative here. And going back to how he began his campaign back in Mobile, Alabama, four years ago. And this is his base, and he -- and NASCAR, the mostly white male and southern oriented constituency of NASCAR, if you will, that's Trump's base. He feels like he owns it. How dare somebody tell my friends they can't have the rebel flag flying? KURTZ: Well, I was just making the point that this surge in violence had a lot of big cities doesn't get a whole lot of coverage, maybe because it's considered something that's been ongoing for years. Gillian, final question, quick point -- (CROSSTALK) KURTZ: All right. I was talking about nationwide media coverage. Gillian, when the president tweets about not just NASCAR, but -- OK. Gillian, when the president tweets not just about NASCAR, but he's against the Washington Redskins or the Cleveland Indians changing their name, a lot of people say that's a distraction from COVID and the economy and all of that. But I think many in the media don't really understand how these issues resonate with a good chunk of the country out there, quick thought. TURNER: And they do resonate with a good chunk of the country. But that doesn't mean these are waters for the president, not just President Trump but any president to wade into. It's private sector business. I don't think that there is really a place for any American president to weigh in on what he thinks about the name change of a sports team, same like NASCAR, perfect opportunity for President Trump to stay out of the fray, to stay above the chaos, missed opportunity. KURTZ: Right. Well, this president weighs in on just about everything. Gillian, we'll see you a little later. Ben Domenech, Clarence Page, thanks very much for joining us. Coming up, why liberals are celebrating the high court rulings on Donald Trump's tax returns without really getting much at all. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) KURTZ: Many liberal commentators are rejoicing over a pair of Supreme Court rulings on President Trump's tax returns. And the president vented his anger on Twitter, even though the 7-2 decisions don't require him to turn anything over right now. The court said Manhattan DA's Cyrus Vance has a right to go after Trump's financial records in a grand jury probe. And then House Democrats potentially have the right to subpoena his returns, while kicking both cases back to the lower courts. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Not only will I tell you during the campaign I could stand on Fifth Avenue and shoot someone and it wouldn't hurt me at all. He had a lawyer go into court and say that in his behalf too. The Supreme Court unanimously says to that no. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: And the media was downright giddy about the Supreme Court's ruling on Trump's tax returns. But they were wrong. The truth is that one of the rulings today completely destroyed Congress' gross unconstitutional overstep in trying to obtain Trump's tax returns. (END VIDEO CLIP) KURTZ: Ben, sorry for thanking you guys prematurely. Fascinating to watch the media praising the Supreme Court for declaring independence from President Trump in saying he doesn't have total immunity against subpoenas. And yet, even those are procedural rulings that kick this whole thing well past the election and beyond. DOMENECH: As a political matter, this is a win for President Trump. It's something that means that they're not going to be able to pour over his tax returns in the context of an election year. He has enough challenges as it is when it comes to this election. But in terms of the nuance here, I think this is another example where the rush to report about Supreme Court rulings ends up missing a lot of what's going on there procedurally. And I think in this instance, a lot of people saw this as -- were on the left saw this as a win for them and then came to realize that at least in the short political measure, it's not. KURTZ: Yeah. In political terms, I think you're right because it freezes the action. Clarence, the president was not pleased, as I mentioned, tweeting this as all political prosecution. I won the Mueller witch hunt. Courts in the past have given broad deference, but not me, and then goes into his accusations that Obama and Biden spied on him, your thoughts. PAGE: There's the self-prosecution syndrome of President Trump. Everything is about him and everything is some effort to get after him. Look, I'm not so partisan that I feel that this is a partisan victory for the right or the left. I'm happy that it's a victory you for the Constitution. It's a victory for the presidential accountability to Congress and the other branches. Not just as a partisan victory or loss, this won't have much effect before the election. But that's not the purpose of the Supreme Court. They're supposed to protect the Constitution. And I'm glad somebody is. KURTZ: What's also striking is that Trump's appointees, Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch joined John Roberts and the liberal ring in reaching this decision about immunity, even though it's sort of theoretical for the moment. And I think the media, the disappointment is not so much about the legal principles here, but this has been this great hunger since the 2016 campaign to find out if there's anything damaging in the president's tax returns. Obviously, we'll not find out for sometime if we ever do. Ben Domenech and Clarence Page, this time, I will wish you a great Sunday. Thanks very much for joining us. DOMENECH: Thank you. PAGE: Thank you, Howie. KURTZ: ESPN has suspended basketball reporter Adrian Wojnarowski without pay for sending an e-mail to Senator Josh Hawley after the Republican lawmaker had criticized the NBA's relationship with China that said F you. Woj has apologized for being disrespectful and making a regrettable mistake. Fox News has quickly pointed company with a top writer for Tucker Carlson Tonight in the wake of extremely serious disclosures. In a memo to the staff yesterday, Fox News' CEO Suzanne Scott and president and executive editor Jay Wallace minced no words about what happened. On Friday, they said we learned that now former employee Blake Neff, a writer on Tucker Carlson Tonight, made horrendous and deeply offensive racist, sexist, and homophobic comments under a pseudonym on the form AutoAdmit. We want to make it abundantly that Fox News Media strongly condemns this horrific racist, misogynistic, and homophobic behavior. Neff's abhorrent conduct on this forum was never divulged in the show or the network until Friday, at which point we swiftly accepted the resignation. Make no mistake. Actions such as his cannot and will not be tolerated at any time in any part of our workforce. The disclosures were reported by CNN. What Neff posted anonymously over five years is very ugly stuff, such as racist jokes including the N word, derogatory slurs for gays and lesbians, denigrating the Mormon religion, and mocking a woman's dating life. A Fox executive says Tucker Carlson will address the situation on Monday night's show. Next on MediaBuzz, the media uproar over President Trump vowing to pressure the governors into reopening the schools this fall with parents caught in the middle. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) KURTZ: President Trump told Greta Van Susteren the other day that we are in a good place with the coronavirus. Such comments sparking media uproar as the COVID-19 surged at seven records in 11 days, reaching over 66,000 cases on Friday alone. Now, the media spotlight has shifted to whether and how the nation's schools can reopen in September. The president is criticizing the CDC guidelines which are being tinkered with and the president tweeting that he would cut off federal funding to schools whose buildings stay closed. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I think it's going to be good for them politically so they keep the schools closed. No way. So we're very much going to put pressure on governors and everybody else to open the schools. \u00a0NICOLLE WALLACE, MSNBC HOST: It is ghoulish for Donald Trump to inject his broken, corrupt, incompetent political approach to the global pandemic into what is a life and death, painful, lose-lose decision for most parents. \u00a0RUSH LIMBAUGH, TALK SHOW HOST AND CONSERVATIVE POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: \u00a0The president is out there demanding that the schools open and for the sake of the economy, for the sake of the divorce rate, for the sake of sanity among parents, they need to open, and for the sake of the children not starving. (END VIDEO CLIP) KURTZ: Joining us now to analyze the coverage, Gayle Trotter, commentator who hosts \"Right in DC\" podcast, and Mara Liasson, NPR's national political reporter and a Fox News contributor. Gayle, the media have slammed the president, as you know, for saying he will pressure the governors and potentially cut off funding to get the schools reopen. Doesn't that contradict the conservative idea of federalism, which is that the president doesn't have absolute power and that local officials control such things as local schools? \u00a0GAYLE TROTTER, COMMENTATOR, HOST OF \"RIGHT IN DC\" PODCAST: I'm glad you brought that up, Howie, because our attorney general, Bill Barr, said the same thing that it's surprising in terms of federalism that governors are going against their constitutions and using their emergency powers to do so many things that a limited government conservative would not be in favor of. And we're seeing the media criticizing President Trump for encouraging Americans to go back to work, for children to go back to school. And we've seen organizations like the American Academy of Pediatrics urging children to be physically present in schools in the fall. And yet the media are aligned with the Biden campaign and the talking points of the teachers union who want to keep the schools closed this fall. And that goes against what a lot of American parents want, to have the schools -- KURTZ: Right. TROTTER: -- reopened safely and with health as a primary concern. KURTZ: Well, I think parents are divided. Journalists are also parents. I would love to have my kids back in school, Mara. But the media tends to focus on whether it's safe, not just for the kids themselves but for teachers and staff. And so they are largely casting this as the president is trying to score a political victory by forcing the schools to open while the president says he thinks it's the Democrats who think they will benefit if the buildings remain closed. \u00a0MARA LIASSON, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR, NATIONAL POLITICAL REPORTER FOR NATIONAL PUBLIC RADIO: Yeah. I think that this is one of those cases where the media isn't one monolithic thing. First of all, parents desperately, me included, want their kids back in school and we desperately want our kids safely back in school. But the media has also pointed out correctly that 90 percent of school funding comes from local governments and states. The president only, I think, has control of about 10 percent of it. So he doesn't have a lot of leverage. He does have a bully pulpit. The problem is that he also urged states to open up economies which people wanted, and in a lot of places, that didn't work out so well. So it's a cautionary tale for every school district that is struggling with where they're going to find the money to do the extra sanitation, the plexiglass, the masks, the extra classrooms if you have to spread kids out. I mean, this is a huge problem and instead of trading blame about who wants to keep schools shut, who wants to keep them open, maybe the federal government and the states could work together on a plan for how to open schools safely. KURTZ: Well, speaking of working together, the president and vice president have been at odds with the Centers for Disease Control over the guidelines that could help schools make these decisions. CDC Chief Robert Redfield was on \"Good Morning, America.\" Let's take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS, ANCHOR, ABC NEWS: Should the doctors and scientists with the CDC be taking that kind of political direction from the president? ROBERT REDFIELD, CHIEF, CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION: I think it's important, George, to realize -- you used the word \"guidelines.\" That's what the CDC has done, they provide guidance. They're not requirements. (END VIDEO CLIP) KURTZ: So Gayle, the CDC is now getting a lot of media criticism for being under -- perhaps bending to political pressure from the White House. TROTTER: Expert opinions are very important but experts in any field are not accountable to the American people. We don't have a government of the experts, by the experts, and for the experts. Instead, we have democratic accountability and that's why we choose leaders to make these hard decisions for us. And if you look at the track record of the experts, they're continually changing their advice. In March, we saw Dr. Fauci, the WHO, the U.S. surgeon general, the CDC, all argue against masks. And then when new information arose, they changed their recommendations. So it's not a monolithic thing. But that is why -- KURTZ: Right. TROTTER: -- we have democratic accountability for leaders. KURTZ: Right. Now, speaking of Anthony Fauci, Mara, he hasn't spoken to the president in over a month. LIASSON: Right. KURTZ: He has had to cancel TV interviews. The president told Sean Hannity that Dr. Fauci is a nice man but he has made a lot of mistakes, picking up on Gayle's point. Here's what Anthony Fauci told the Financial Times, if we can put it up. \"I have a reputation, as you probably figured out, of speaking the truth at all times and not sugar-coating things. That may be one of the reasons why I haven't been on television very much lately.\" So you have this partisan debate over whether the president is side-lining people like Fauci. \u00a0LIASSON: Well, there's no doubt that the White House has chosen not to put Fauci on television as much as they did in the beginning when he was kind of a good housekeeping seal of approval for the president. He was the scientist who was going to tell everybody what to do and how to stay safe, et cetera. And as the president has wanted to open up faster than maybe Dr. Fauci thinks that we should open, he has been pushed to the side a bit. But Dr. Fauci has also come to the president's rescue a couple times, trying to explain why the president said 99 percent of the cases are harmless. He said maybe he misinterpreted data about one percent mortality rate. But there's no doubt that Dr. Fauci is less useful to the White House right now. KURTZ: All right. I need a brief answer from each of you. First, you, Gayle, you have six children. I know you would like to see them back in school. Many schools, including New York City and elsewhere, are planning to have a couple days on, a couple days off, a couple weeks on, couple weeks off, in order to keep the crowding down in the classrooms. Very little press attention to how that would put pressure on working parents, what to do when the kids are home doing the online learning thing. \u00a0TROTTER: That's right. Americans want their kids back in school. They want to get back to work and they want it to be done safely and responsibly. And the CDC has released very extensive guidelines on how to do that. There's a lot of different information about young children and the distances you need. So that is something that should not be political. It should be somewhere where we all join together in the American spirit of back to work and stick-to-itiveness. KURTZ: Right. And Mara, the president also slammed Harvard University which plans to go all online for the next academic year, saying they should be ashamed of themselves and it is the easy way out. Other university systems are also planning that. Are the media buying into that criticism? \u00a0LIASSON: I don't know. Look, college is a different situation. Harvard, by the way, is having people come back to campus and go to school online. So it's not like they're keeping everybody out of school. Each school has to make these decisions for themselves. This is a tough, complicated problem. This is what Gayle said, we got to figure out how to open up safely. KURTZ: Tough and complicated, absolutely. Gayle Trotter, Mara Liasson, great to see you this Sunday. After the break, why the media are going haywire over the book by President Trump's niece and is that fair? And later, are Kanye's White House ambitions fake news? (COMMERCIAL BREAK) KURTZ: I had sort of hoped to avoid talking about this new book by Mary Trump, the president's niece, but leaked copies are drawing enormous coverage in The New York Times, The Washington Post, and the other cable news channels. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) \u00a0JOY REID, MSNBC NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Perhaps one of the reasons the family has fought so hard to keep the book under wraps has to do with the fear that Mary Trump, as the best expert you can get on Donald Trump, his own relative, could tear down the false image that Trump has created. \u00a0RACHEL MADDOW, MSNBC HOST: One of family member in question here is now the president of the United States. A family portrait of him and how he became who he is and who he has long been, it can send a chill down your spine. KELLYANNE CONWAY, SENIOR COUNSEL TO THE PRESIDENT: We imbue instant credibility unto anybody, especially those not under oath and writing works of fiction perhaps or fiction within work of fiction, as long as they're out there to get the president. I think reporters ought to focus on getting the story and not getting the president. (END VIDEO CLIP) KURTZ: Joining us now from New York, Kat Timpf of Fox's \"Greg Gutfeld Show\" and the host of Fox Nation's \"Sincerely, Kath.\" Now, Mary Trump despises her uncle has been in litigation of her being cut out of the will after her father Fred Jr. died an alcoholic and hasn't had much contract with the president for many years. Why is this book getting such a huge media ride? KAT TIMPF, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: This happens when every one of these books come out. This is obviously the first one by a relative, but there is a whole genre of books at this point of people who have been (INAUDIBLE), the behind the scenes, salacious type of thing. And I think it's the same thing every time where Trump's detractors really love to sink their teeth into it and say, wow, look at this, this guy is crazy. But I don't think it really changes the level of support among his supporters whatsoever. I think people just kind of brush it off entirely and don't even consider what's in it. So, I don't understand, these keep getting written. It's almost like a TMZ-esque genre really more than any actual sort of anything else. KURTZ: Interesting analogy. The president tried to stop publication of this book, which is too much and never enough. The book -- Mary Trump writes in this book that Donald Trump paid a guy named Joe Shapiro to take the SAT for him. That helped him get into the University of Pennsylvania. Well, The Washington Post to its credit tracked down the sister of Shapiro, who is now deceased, and she said this can't be true because Joe didn't meet Donald until they were both students at Pen. So that kind of fell apart. TIMPF: Yeah, that one fell apart. And again, whenever you're reading something like this, you do have to take it with a grain of salt. Sure, some of it is probably true, looks like some of it isn't. But again, the way that it's covered too is quite interesting. A lot of it is a little overblown in the way it's been covered. For example, I saw a piece in the LA Times and the headline was that horror clouds every page, right? OK, like really, like the part about how when he was a kid, he hid his brother's trucks, like not a nice thing to do, but I wouldn't call it horror, right? KURTZ: It's like one of the blurbs from a movie, horror clouds every page. TIMPF: Yeah. KURTZ: Mary Trump is a clinical psychologist with a PHD. She writes Donald's pathologies are complex and his behavious are often inexplicable, he's a narcissist, and she blames this on the stern treatment of his father, Fred Sr. But I question whether her personal animus undercuts the book. I believe that if some relative of Barack Obama had published a book trashing the 44th president, there would be great debate in the media, should we really cover this, but there's no hesitation here to cover all of the dirty family laundry. TIMPF: Right, absolutely. It's so interesting because you do have to acknowledge that obviously they don't get along. It's a spat over money, essentially, at the end of the day, that they haven't really spoken or anything like that. You do have to keep in mind who is the narrator of this. There are people who know me, who don't like me, and I wouldn't want -- wouldn't like to read their book. They probably have horrible things to say. You have to keep that in mind. But again, it's salacious, it is fun for people to read and kind of tease the president if they don't like him, but I truly don't think anyone else really actually cares or I don't see how you could. KURTZ: Right. Well, a lot of copies have been printed. Before we go -- TIMPF: Yeah. KURTZ: -- yesterday, President Trump visited Walter Reed, and for the first time in front of the cameras, he was seen wearing a mask, actually a black mask with the presidential seal. Do you think that he -- he said that, you know, well, it's a hospital, it's appropriate. Do you think he wanted to finally put an end to all the media criticism, why aren't you wearing a mask? \u00a0TIMPF: Yeah, I think he -- I think he certainly did. He obviously -- I think that it's bad that it has become a sort of political thing. If you're a mask wearing person, you're liberal, and if not, you're conservative. It shouldn't have anything to do with it. So I was glad to see him wearing the mask and especially if you're in a situation like a hospital. And also -- KURTZ: Yeah, I do think -- TIMPF: -- he's constantly getting tested and that sort of stuff, too. So - - KURTZ: Yeah, right, but -- TIMPF: -- someone like me, I'm not getting tested for COVID every day. KURTZ: I do think it sets a good example. TIMPF: Yes. KURTZ: Kat Timpf, great to see you as always. Still to come, the kind of bogus story that's generating a whole lot of buzz. Kanye claims he's running for president. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) KURTZ: I'm not really buying this story but it sure generating plenty of us. Kanye West says he is running for president right now supposedly. You would recall that Kanye praised President Trump a couple of years back in a rambling Oval Office visit. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KANYE WEST: They tried to scare me to not wear this hat. But his hat, it gives me -- it gives me power in a way. (END VIDEO CLIP) KURTZ: The rapper now tells Forbes Magazine, I'm taking the red hat off with this interview, that he had the coronavirus, he's never voted in his life, and he's OK drawing black support from Joe Biden because to say that the black vote is democratic is a form of racism and white supremacy. We're back with Gillian Turner. This seems pretty bogus to me. Kanye hasn't made a move to get on a single state ballot. He's had mental health issues in the past. Why so much coverage for Kanye? \u00a0GILLIAN TURNER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Register with the FEC, which would be the first step he would take -- this campaign would take to show that they're serious about it. But any journalist in America who tells you they know whether he's serious or not is lying, because his own wife, Kim Kardashian, reportedly doesn't know whether he's serious. Her friends and family members have been telling People magazine, I was just reading about this, that it's unclear to her whether he's serious at all or whether he's completely unserious. So she doesn't know. We definitely don't know. KURTZ: All right. So first he's got to win the Kardashian primary. Now, on a more serious note, Ghislaine Maxwell was tracked down and arrested, charged with helping the monstrous sexual predator Jeffrey Epstein with at least three girls who were abused by the late predator. She's on an intensified suicide watch, wearing paper clothes after Epstein's jail house death. I know this is an important story. But it seems to me there is some X factor here that is really driving the coverage into the stratosphere. TURNER: Well, one thing that's amazing about this story is that as horrible as it is, it's like the one story so far in 2020 that everybody agrees on. There's no partisan split here. Republicans or conservatives think one thing and Democrats or liberals think another. Everybody is in perfect agreement on the fact that he was a monster. Most people think, you know, it's a good thing that he's no longer walking freely on the face of the earth being a predator. So, it is interesting that the Ghislaine Maxwell storyline is following the same trend here. Mostly bipartisan support -- KURTZ: Right. I think -- TURNER: -- she is a bad lady. KURTZ: Yeah. Well, speaking of bipartisanship, I mean, Epstein was friends with a lot of people in both parties, the elites. And also, she is sort of this mystery woman -- TURNER: Good point. KURTZ: -- and of course the suicide and the conspiracy theories about Epstein also factor in. Finally, the Central Park dog walker, Amy Cooper, was actually charged this week of filing a false police report in that incident in New York where she lied about an African American man, a bird watcher, who said -- she said he was threatening her. Why are the media still milking this story? \u00a0TURNER: Because it picks up on the racial -- the struggle for racial justice that's going on right now. But I like that the media is so woke that even her dog is now going to get justice. People jumped all over the fact that she was choking him inadvertently while she was yelling at this guy. Now, the dog has been taken away from her, getting put up for adoption. KURTZ: I didn't have the canine angle. I like the fact that the black bird watcher, Christian Cooper, says, you know what, she lost her job, I'm not going to pile on, and he is not cooperating with the prosecution. Gillian, great to see you, have a great Sunday. \u00a0TURNER: You, too. KURTZ: And that's it for this edition of \"Media Buzz.\" I'm Howard Kurtz. We hope you will like our Facebook page.

For the first time, a Republican and Democrat are teaming up to do it, and both will be here on it. But, first, violence continues to escalate in Portland for 56 nights. And now the city is banning the police from working with federal officers. Welcome, everyone. I'm Charles Payne, in for Neil Cavuto. And this is \"Your World.\" To Dan Springer in Seattle with the very latest -- Dan. DAN SPRINGER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Yes, Charles, it was some of the worst violence yet in Portland. For several hours, hundreds of protesters battle with federal officers. And right in the middle of this was the city's mayor, Ted Wheeler. He was there for solidarity, for what he is calling or what he called last night a listening session. But when he started talking, he was shouted down with obscenity. He was called a Nazi. Someone spit at him, and he was told to resign by many people. Then he was hit with tear gas, not once, but twice. After the second guessing, his security detail, well, they got him out of the area to a sheltering in a city building nearby. Federal police were firing tear gas and flashbangs for hours, as hundreds of fireworks were shot at the federal courthouse. Arsonists also threw Molotov cocktails. They broke through a fence around the courthouse, set fires and tampered with a fire hydrant. But when asked about his tear gassing, Wheeler told a reporter that he saw nothing that would provoke that kind of response. The Department of Justice Office of Inspector General has opened a review of the conduct of the federal officers in Portland. Several lawsuits have been filed claiming civil rights abuses. But the federal agencies are pushing back, saying that three of their officers may lose their sight after getting hit in the eyes with laser beams. At least 38 officers have been doxed, their identities revealed on social media. And now the Portland City Council has passed a law banning the Portland P.D. from helping the federal officers in any way. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CHAD WOLF, ACTING U.S. SECRETARY OF HOMELAND SECURITY: It does not allow local law enforcement to coordinate or support, even in perhaps life- threatening situations, federal officers. That is dangerous. (END VIDEO CLIP) SPRINGER: Portland police did eventually declare a riot last night, but they never engaged. Not a single arrest was made -- Charles. PAYNE: Dan, thank you very much. Defund cities that defund the police, well, that's what two lawmakers, a Democrat and a Republican, are proposing. With me now, New York Democrat Congressman Anthony Brindisi, along with Pennsylvania Republican Congressman Brian Fitzpatrick. Welcome, Congressmen. Let me start with you, Congressman Brindisi. How exactly would this work? REP. ANTHONY BRINDISI (D-NY): Well, what the bill says is that, if a city moves to defund the police department, if they want to abolish the police department or significantly cut funding to a police department, then they - - that would put them at risk of losing certain federal grants. And I think we have to step back and acknowledge that our law enforcement does, by and large, very good work. Most officers serve with dignity and respect. And these are very difficult times that our country is going through right now. We should be having conversations about how we reform policing and improve relations. However, I don't think we should be doing that at the expense of cutting back at -- on things like community engagement programs, or body cameras, which hold bad actors accountable, or on training, which police need to be able to protect and serve. PAYNE: Representative Fitzpatrick, we have already seen where individual cities have already taken the initiative, New York City, a billion-dollar cut, AOC actually asking and demanding a lot more. Do you think this will be enough of a disincentive, or do we need a bigger public relations campaign? REP. BRIAN FITZPATRICK (R-PA): Well, this is all part of the whole push, Charles. I'm a career FBI agent, I spent my entire adult life in law enforcement. And my goal was to build a bipartisan coalition here in Washington, D.C., to make sure that we have a voice defending our police officers. They are under assault right now. And they need our support. Do we need to make reforms? Of course we do. And our coalition believes that that should happen. And we will do that in a responsible manner. But these calls to defund the police -- Mayor de Blasio cut $1 billion out of a $6 billion budget of the NYPD, at a time when they need more help than they ever have. We need some voices of reason. And they need to start speaking up. And that's what we're going to do. And like everything I do, we're going to do this in a bipartisan manner to make sure we get the whole country on board. PAYNE: Representative Brindisi, you have got some very powerful voices in your party, your political party. I'd be interested in a couple things, first, the kind of pushback or agreement that you're seeing and talking about behind closed doors, and also the images that we're getting out of Portland, where, clearly, elected officials are making the police and the federal law enforcement agents the bad guys. They're turning them into villains in a public relations campaign that I think is making this worse. They're emboldening those folks out there who - - it's not just a peaceful protest, not all 56 nights. BRINDISI: Yes, you're exactly correct. And I think that the point behind this legislation -- and I commend Congressman Fitzpatrick, and I'm proud to work with him on this -- is to really build a bipartisan coalition here, because, by and large, if you poll the majority of Americans, they will tell you, yes, we do have to see some reforms to policing. Yes, we have to improve relationships between police and the communities that they're charged with protecting and serving. But, by and large, the Americans on both sides, I think, are against abolishing police departments, defunding police departments. And that's what this bill is meant to address. PAYNE: All right. BRINDISI: And we're building this bipartisan coalition. I have talked to a number of members on my side of the aisle who are interested in this legislation. And we should have respect for law enforcement. As I said at the top, it's a dangerous profession. These men and women risk their lives every single day when they go out there to defend us. I have heard some of the heartbreaking stories of the officers in Portland and other cities. And it's tough right now to be a police officer. PAYNE: I want to just follow up, Representative Brindisi, about the presidential candidate for your party, Joe Biden. He hasn't used the word defund, but he has used the term redirect. Maybe it's a game of semantics. It means the same thing to me, if money is not going into the police departments, which, by the way, could use extra funding for these improvements in the training that everyone is -- everyone agrees that they should have. BRINDISI: Well, if you look at -- when you start cutting back -- and many police budgets are already under strain -- when you start cutting back, the first thing the departments will start cutting are things like community policing, community engagement programs, training, things like that, gear that is necessary for officer safety. And these are all things that are important, body cameras, that are important to help protect and improve relations between the police departments and the communities that they serve. And I'm all for investing in mental health and education. I think our officers are being asked to do way more than they have to right now. They're becoming educators, health care professionals, mental health counselors. PAYNE: Right. BRINDISI: So, they do need some help. And we do need to be making investments at the local level, the state level, and the federal level in mental health and education, but not at the expense of taking away things like community engagement programs and training for police. PAYNE: All right. Representative Fitzpatrick, what I'm concerned about, of course, is the -- is the message that's coming from very highly regarded politicians. Again, I would love to see Vice President Biden come out and not use terms like redirect, and claim it's not the same as defund. And, by the same token, the American public overwhelmingly is against this idea. So, do you think they will -- maybe we can stem the tide of this crazy notion of defunding the police? FITZPATRICK: That's exactly what we're doing down here, Charles. That's why I'm building a bipartisan coalition that, as Anthony mentioned, is growing. PAYNE: Yes. FITZPATRICK: There are a lot of people that are interested in joining this. And we will be the voice to have the backs of the men and women that serve our communities. We all see the terrible images on television. They have -- they have always had a hard job. Their job is especially hard now. PAYNE: Right. FITZPATRICK: And they need our -- they need our support, and they're going to get our support. PAYNE: It's extremely hard. And we salute both of you. It's rare we see bipartisanship, particularly on something like this. Thank you both very much. FITZPATRICK: Thank you, Charles. PAYNE: Meanwhile, folks, the question, is Washington so focus on extra unemployment checks running out, that they're ignoring the debt clock that's running up? White House Budget Director Russ Vought joins me. He's next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) PAYNE: Stocks falling on signs that a coronavirus relief push Washington may be stalling, but maybe not. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is on the Senate floor, speaking about the new push for a new bill. Let's go to Chad Pergram with the very latest -- Chad. CHAD PERGRAM, FOX NEWS SENIOR CAPITOL HILL PRODUCER: Well, this is coming right off the presses as we speak here. The Senate majority leader was expected to release a framework for this coronavirus bill this morning. That did not happen. We got nothing but radio silence. But here's what he said in just the past couple of minutes. He says he will release a framework for this bill next week. And it will include three major tenets. He says kids, jobs and health care. Now, there seems to be a lot of dissonance on the Republican side of the aisle. And the reason this is taking a long time to get together is that not all Republicans are in agreement here. And this is why Chuck Schumer, the minority leader, says that the GOP is in disarray. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY), MINORITY LEADER: They have been so divided, so disorganized, so unprepared that they have struggled to even draft a partisan proposal within their own conference. They can't come together. (END VIDEO CLIP) PERGRAM: The secretary of the Treasury, Steve Mnuchin, today announced the administration would drop its demand for a payroll tax cut. There were only about 10 Republican senators who supported that, and it would explode the deficit to the tune of hundreds of billions of dollars. Plus, there are divides about extending unemployment benefits. Republicans raised hackles back in March that some people would receive more money off the job than on. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. LISA MURKOWSKI (R-AK): And I do think that what we're trying to do is to avoid some of the unintended consequences that we saw with the full-on $600 added to every state's base unemployment. (END VIDEO CLIP) PERGRAM: Now, there's kind of an artificial deadline at the end of next week, July 31. That's when these unemployment benefits, these extra unemployment benefits expire. And Republican and Democratic senators, they have to come to an agreement if they want to have more direct payments to Americans. These are the nitty-gritty details, and the cost of those and the price tag there, that's going to be major -- Charles, back to you. PAYNE: Chad, before I let you go, the $600, there was a report out earlier, Mnuchin saying 70 percent of people's incomes. That's a big difference for a whole lot of working Americans. That's a giant gulf to navigate in a very short period of time. PERGRAM: Absolutely. And that's why we were hearing numbers of maybe just $100 or $200 there. Republicans are very concerned about the price tag. But just because they say that this is going to be the last bill, there's worry that there might be another bill sometime in the fall or the winter, if this continues to grow. PAYNE: Right. PERGRAM: And I talked about the overall cost of that payroll tax cut, which seems to be off the table right now, Charles. PAYNE: All right, Chad, thank you very much. Always appreciate it. So, how does not including a payroll tax cut in this next coronavirus release bill sit with the White House? I want to bring in right now Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought. Russ, congratulations on the job being permanent. Let's talk about some of the things we -- that was thrown out there, including this payroll -- payroll tax cut. Apparently, it will not be part of the final package. How is President Trump feeling about that? RUSSELL VOUGHT, WHITE HOUSE BUDGET DIRECTOR: Well, he's obviously disappointed that it's headed in that direction, but he wants to get a bill. We're hard at work trying to get a bill. Unfortunately, we are dealing with a recalcitrant Democrat majority that is insisting that we fund big government, as opposed to pro-growth economic policies that get this economy back in terms of the V-shaped recovery. PAYNE: Speaking of the V-shaped recovery, J.P. Morgan last week said that extra 600 bucks was the magic ingredient, that people went out and they spent that extra 600 bucks, and that's why we saw employment come back so quickly, we saw a record-breaking retail sales rebound. So, they're essentially saying, if you take that away, you really endanger the recovery. How are you feeling about that? VOUGHT: Well, I think it's important to take a step back and remember that unemployment benefits is going to go on and exist for the entirety of this year. Most states have about a year's worth of unemployment insurance. That's not going to just artificially sunset at the end of next week. What we're talking about is the additional benefit on top of that, that Congress put in place... PAYNE: Right. VOUGHT: ... that has provided a disincentive for small businesses to be able to get their workers back, because they get more money than they had previously worked for. So, we're trying to make sure we remove that disincentive, still do something to be able to extend at somewhere in the neighborhood of 70 percent, so that you're not -- it's not 100 percent of what you used to make, and be able to remove that disincentive to get people back to work working for small businesses. PAYNE: And for those who don't have a job waiting for them, but now they're only getting 70 percent of their incomes, it's a heck of a calculation that the White House and Republicans have to make on this. VOUGHT: Well, again, we're not for not doing any bill. We want to be able to continue to put people -- put money in people's pockets, continue to do -- get a bill done. We have got to get this economy continuing to be on the mend, approximating a V-shaped recovery. But we have got to do it right, Charles. And we got to make sure we remove disincentives, so that small businesses can get the workers back to work. PAYNE: What kind of -- speaking of small businesses, what other adjustments can there be for the PPP program? Eighty-five percent of the applications went to these $150,000 or less, but almost 85 percent of the money went to the bigwigs, you know, these million-dollar bailouts. That did not sit well with the general public. VOUGHT: Sure. Well, we have got money that still has not been spent, about $130 billion that can be reallocated. You know, I think, at the end of the day, the PPP program is going to be an incredibly successful program. History will speak kindly about this program. And I think the examples where it went to those that it was not intended for will be the vast minority, and that this went to diners, and small hardware stores, and small businesses across the country. PAYNE: Right. VOUGHT: And I think you're going to see history reflect very well on that important program. PAYNE: I'm inclined to believe you're 100 percent right. History is going to look kindly on the way the federal government reacted, the White House, the Federal Reserve, and programs like PPP, which -- which makes people wonder, is Mitch McConnell -- are they taking this too slow at this point? I mean, when Mitch McConnell says, kids, jobs and health care, I'm not even sure what he's talking about. But many are saying, we need to cobble something together before July 31. VOUGHT: Well, we're at -- hard at work to be able to do that. I don't think that Senate Republican leadership is in any way trying to take this slow. I think they're working very hard to get a bill that can pass. Our negotiators are hard at work doing that. On the school front, we want to make sure that we have taken the excuse for schools to open up off the table, and we want to put in policies that... PAYNE: Right. VOUGHT: ... help incentivize them to reopen. And so I think that's what we refer to when we're talking about kids. PAYNE: OK. VOUGHT: But we have got to make sure the policy gets right. And that's what we're hard at work doing. PAYNE: Yes, if kids don't go back to school, there is no economy, because so many parents can't go back to work. Russ, I want to ask you about the White House rolling back this Obama era, affinity -- Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing. It's sort of a tongue- twister known as AFFH. It came about in 2015. It was -- President Obama attached this to some of the things for HUD. Ben Carson pushed hard that this was too complicated, it was too costly. President Trump listened. And now there are howls saying that this is discriminatory and it's racist. Explain why this should have been taken out of this, out of the HUD's program. VOUGHT: Yes, it has nothing to do with racism. And it is a tongue-twister. But, basically, what you saw was a -- President Obama and Vice President Biden's war on the suburbs, where you were using the power of the federal government to bully neighborhoods and localities into changing their zoning restrictions, and to be able to reflect and deal with artificial balances, imbalances that might exist that have nothing to do with race. And what we have come along and done is to basically say, we believe you can further fair housing by providing affordable, safe, decent, nondiscriminatory housing without the federal government bullying mayors and local officials into changing their zoning restrictions to do away with single family houses. PAYNE: You know, there's a war on the single-family home. It's an ideological war. And this was part of it. I believe that the single-family home, the white picket fence -- it sounds corny, Russ -- I still think that's the American dream, and some people don't like that. Congratulations, again, and it's great having you on the show. We appreciate it. VOUGHT: Thanks, Charles. PAYNE: Well, batter up, because, baseball, it's finally opening up. The pros are ready to play. And something tells me viewers are ready to watch. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) \u00a0PAYNE: Play ball. Opening day is here, and it's just hours away. Abby Hornacek will join us on just how it's all going to go down. And we will be back in 60 seconds. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) PAYNE: Well, the first pitch of the Major League Baseball season just a little over two hours away, as players prepare for a season without fans in the stands -- well, or at least without real people. All right, want to go to Abby Hornacek, who is going to fill us in on this brave new world. (LAUGHTER) PAYNE: Now, listen, I know robots and androids are taking all of our jobs, but they're going to be the fans now, too? ABBY HORNACEK, \"PARK'D\" HOST: They're taking our spots. Yes, they're taking our spots in the stands, Charles. What is going on? (LAUGHTER) HORNACEK: No, I actually think that this is a great idea. They are experimenting with virtual fans. And, of course, it's not ideal, but I think it's our best option right now. And here is why. So, they have been talking about how they're going to pipe in these crowd noises at the games, which my first reaction was, this is going to sound like a really bad sitcom, when people are laughing in the background and there's no one actually in studio. But when you add in this augmented reality, you're putting life behind those sounds. And, Charles, I don't know about you. But when I watch a baseball game, I'm not looking at the faces of the fans, minus the times where you get that viral video of maybe a guy holding a baby and a beer, and then there's a foul ball and the ball lands in the beer. Then it matters. But I think people will get used to the fact that these are not real people. And it looks so realistic, they will forget about it altogether. PAYNE: So -- but we're not at that stage yet, though, where, say, there is a foul ball, that one of these the android-like things gets up and catches it. I mean, have they gotten that advanced yet? HORNACEK: Can that happen? PAYNE: Or will they just -- what's going to happen? (LAUGHTER) HORNACEK: Yes. You know, I'm not sure. I think that they just disappear. (CROSSTALK) HORNACEK: If they could make some form of augmented -- if they could make some form of augmented reality that could catch balls... PAYNE: What are the players saying about this? HORNACEK: So, here's the thing about the players. And I think the reaction with fans, is that OK? Well, this might be a little weird to watch on TV. I honestly don't think that the players care, because I actually watched a really interesting interview this morning with Pete Alonso. And he was saying that, look, these guys come up through the farm system. So they're not used to playing -- until they reach the majors, they're not used to playing in front of these crowds that you get at Citi Field or Yankee Stadium. So I really don't think they -- it matters -- it matters to them. They just want to play ball. And, if anything, it'll hopefully return them to the reason that they started playing baseball in the first place, for the love of the game. PAYNE: Well, all right, I hear you there. But what about the home field advantage, that energy that the home team gets from the crowd, and they're behind, and it's the bottom of the ninth? And there's something that you feel, right? I mean, no matter what sport it is, you feel it, and it seems to put teams over the top. Is that going to be gone? HORNACEK: I -- yes, I do think an aspect of that will be gone. But with this augmented reality, they're talking about that they can switch the colors of the people in the crowd. They can switch their jerseys or the colors catering to whatever team is having the home field advantage. And get this, Charles. They will make the fans leave if it's a blowout. (LAUGHTER) HORNACEK: So, people are going to be watching that on TV, but the players aren't going to be feeling that. So they're just going to have to get over it, I think. PAYNE: Yes. HORNACEK: Take it back to the little league days, you know? PAYNE: Yes. Yes. What are we looking at now? Who's the favorite? Has anything changed with respect to the who's going to win this year? Have the oddsmakers made any sort of adjustments because of all this? HORNACEK: Yes, you do see the odds changing a little bit. But I think that it -- what's going to really change it is seeing opening day and how all of this plays out and how it plays out for fans at home. Who is watching? I do think that a lot of people are eager to get back there. Sports bettors are eager to get back out there and start laying some action all these games. So I think we will see that shift. And then you have the universal designated hitter, which has been kind of a change, and only 60 games. So, each game matters more. You're not looking at a normal baseball season. PAYNE: Other sports, so we have got racing, we have got baseball, there's the NBA, everyone under the dome. That's going to be another weird experience. But there were questions of whether or not sports would continue. And it looks like we're going to make it through, right? HORNACEK: I think we are, Charles. And it's good for fans. It's good for the players. I think everyone's just eager to see something. And sports have had a universal effect on bringing people together. So, hopefully, that happens in today's climate as well. But the NBA, they're working on their bubble. And baseball is different, because there will be traveling, and there is more of a risk with getting on airplanes and all of that. But I do think we will slowly see sports coming back. NFL season is actually talking about maybe using this augmented reality... PAYNE: Right. HORNACEK: ... with their fans as well. So, baseball's definitely laying the groundwork when it comes to that stuff. PAYNE: All right, well, I want to see these -- this augmented reality crowd in the seventh inning stretch. I want to hear them singing \"Take Me Out to the Ball Game.\" Abby, thank you very much. HORNACEK: I actually -- Charles, I heard a rumor that you're actually going to be singing the seventh inning stretch, and it's going to be an augmented reality of you. (LAUGHTER) HORNACEK: So, I'm looking forward to seeing that. PAYNE: I'm working on it. You got it. See you soon. HORNACEK: Great. Great. PAYNE: You might see me tonight. HORNACEK: Thank you. Great. PAYNE: Hey, in the meantime, we know former President Barack Obama is making a big pitch for Joe Biden's run, but is he also pitching someone to run with him? We will be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) PAYNE: California Democrat Senator Kamala Harris holding a virtual campaign event for Joe Biden. Now, she is said to be on his short list for a running mate. Today, Biden also releasing his latest this pre-taped talk with Barack Obama. Could the former president be steering his former vice president towards a certain V.P. pick? Joining me now, RealClearPolitics' Phil Wegmann. Phil, apparently, I keep reading where Joe Biden is down to four black women as potential V.P. candidates. When I peruse the news further, I see more names in there. Is anyone sort of moving ahead of the pack here? PHILIP WEGMANN, REALCLEARPOLITICS: We know that Kamala Harris certainly seems interested. And there are rumors that she's actually putting out opposition research on other candidates. Those are unconfirmed at this point, but it shows how significant the stakes are. Not only would Biden's V.P. pick obviously be one heartbeat away from the presidency and possibly be his successor, but whoever he picks as a possible vice president, that's going to show us how and according to what ideology a Biden administration would govern from. So this is going to be something to keep a very close eye on, obviously, as we get closer to the Milwaukee convention. PAYNE: So, Phil, I'm looking at the names, Val Demings, Keisha Lance Bottoms, Kamala Harris, Karen Bass, Susan Rice. And I get, OK, he's going to be able to check the box black woman, but the younger part of this political party, where the energy is, the more progressive part of it, does anyone fulfill that area? Because, listen, Bernie Sanders was very close to winning this thing, if it wasn't maybe for a last-minute pushed by Clyburn. WEGMANN: No, you're absolutely right. And while Biden has said that he's going to pick a woman as his vice president, he needs to be able to put someone in that position who's going to maintain African-American support through the general election. Remember, it was black voters who brought Biden's campaign really back from the dead in South Carolina. And then the second part here, which goes to the heart of your question, is, he's got to find someone who is going to make younger voters enthusiastic. Not long ago, during the primary, a lot of millennials, a lot of younger voters were literally saying, please don't make me vote for Joe Biden. So those are two considerations that he has to take care of with whoever he picks. PAYNE: Let's throw out a third one, the enthusiasm gap. Now, of course, there's no doubt a black V.P. would energize the black vote, particularly black women, who really know how to get the entire community out to the polls. But we have seen a tremendous lack of enthusiasm for Joe Biden, and, more recently, his unfavorables have begun to skyrocket. So is there something to be said about a certain spark, a certain kind of energy that could also get more people out? Because I think that's one area that probably won't change for him. WEGMANN: And that's a reflection of the type of campaign that Joe Biden has run so far. He's been running a campaign that has been in self-isolation because of the coronavirus. I think that a vice president pick who could really energize people with newer ideas, folks on the left, that would do his campaign quite a bit of good. David Axelrod talked about this problem in a recent piece, where he pointed out that whoever Biden picks needs to be able to help him win the election, but then the larger question is, not only help him win the election, but be a lieutenant who is ready on day one to really go brawl with Republicans on Capitol Hill, because it is going to be a fight for him to get anything that he has proposed to the finish line. PAYNE: Right. Right. I mean, with this list, he doesn't get a state that he wasn't going to get anywhere and those kinds of things. Barack Obama, former President Obama, is there any -- who's he leaning towards? Is there someone that he might be out there pushing? WEGMANN: Well, we know that President Obama has kept close ties within the party. He was close to Senator Harris. And he was complimentary of a lot of the things that she did. I think that Obama is clearly a voice in Joe Biden's ear right now. He has a tremendous amount of sway. PAYNE: Right. WEGMANN: And not only is he able to sort of bring back some of the nostalgia among Democratic voters by being on stage with Joe Biden. I think that he is a powerful counsel for his former vice president. The two trust each other, and I think he's going to have a significant influence on who Biden picks. PAYNE: Next time, I want the gossip. Who's throwing who under the bus? I will let you off the hook this time. Phil, thank you very much. WEGMANN: Thank you, sir. PAYNE: All right, more cities rolling back their reopenings, as coronavirus cases keep climbing, but are these new lockdowns keeping the economy locked down? (COMMERCIAL BREAK) PAYNE: Well, you're looking live at Chicago and Baltimore, where restrictions are being reimposed tomorrow, as both cities continue to see an uptick in coronavirus cases. So, the question, of course, is, are all these rollbacks holding the economy back? I want to bring in market watcher Heather Zumarraga. Heather, today we got initial jobless claims, the first uptick after 16 straight weeks of decline. A lot of that can be attributed to the fact that many places where we saw reopenings, then they stalled, or they closed, or they reversed. Just how much havoc is this going to create with the economy? HEATHER ZUMARRAGA, FINANCIAL ANALYST: Well, I think this is already creating a lot of havoc in the economy. Now, the stock market is a completely different animal, or has been, at least. When you look at the jobs data, if there is one silver lining, it's that continuing claims have come down, still over a stunning 16 million people filing for continuing claims over and over again. But the number is coming down. And that matters more than the 52 million that originally have filed for unemployment, but not continue to do so. PAYNE: Right. And, Heather, here's the thing. We know that these start, stop, start stops, one of the thing that this V-shaped recovery needed is momentum, because it's -- against all the odds, it's done so much better. Our economy has done so much better than any expert thought it would. But now these experts are back saying, OK, now we're going to be right. Now the V-shape starts to plateau. Now we go back down. And it bothers me, because a lot of these places that are reclosing, I feel, sometimes, it's as much a political decision as a health decision. And if that's the case, they're deliberately harming the economy. ZUMARRAGA: Absolutely. But, look, it should not be political. The economy should remain open, but not at the expense of people's lives or people getting sick. But you wear a mask, like Baltimore mayor and governor of Maryland is enforcing now, and you social distance. The news that we got about the bar in Chicago closing permanently, for good, they're not alone. You're seeing businesses across the board having to shut their doors because we're shutting the economy down. According to Yelp, for example, almost 70,000 small businesses have just given up and they're saying, I can't do this anymore. And so it shouldn't be a matter of a political debate, of Democrats wanting to shut down the economy to save lives and Republicans wanting to keep it open to keep the economy going. There should be a middle common ground that we can take safe measures and cautious measures to keep the economy open. PAYNE: Well, and the realization is that, until there is a vaccine that is -- we have to learn how to coexist, even prosper, amid the virus. So, this is not a long-term option, in my mind. At some point, every state, every municipality, every city has to reopen their economies to a certain degree, or the carnage is going to be so much more than you could believe. ZUMARRAGA: Oh, yes. And I think what's important to most Americans now is not just that $600- per-week unemployment supplemental insurance that's wearing off, but what are we going to do with PPP? Democrats are all in favor of doing another round, as are most Republicans, but this time it will be targeted more towards small businesses. Secretary -- Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has said that. Those that were hit at least 50 percent by COVID will be helped to keep businesses going, and open not those big Harvard endowments or the Potbellys are the Ruth's Chris or those that may not need it. We want to help the people that were shut down due to no circumstance of their own, that this was a self-inflicted shutdown. PAYNE: Right. Heather, you mentioned the $600 additional money, the federal money on top of the typical state unemployment claims. What number should be out there? What is the ultimate number that they should agree on, understanding that a lot of that could probably immediately go back into the economy, but also pile up on the debt? It's a difficult conversation. But we do see where the markets are becoming concerned about this. And that seems to be one of the major battlegrounds between the two parties. ZUMARRAGA: Oh, absolutely. I mean, that's what the fight is about right now. What is that number going to be? Democrats want to extend the benefits at $600 per week. And Republicans are saying, how about $200, maybe $300? Or what Steven Mnuchin is saying is that we give 70 percent of your income. So you target the number to what people making before, because the biggest problem would be that you're receiving more income by staying at home than going to work. And some may deem that an insensitive comment to those that have lost their jobs, but it's really not, because in order to sustain the economy over the long run, you want people to be working and to be employed. And so you can't make more unemployed than you are when you're working. And that's why that's 70 percent of your income prior to COVID number is being looked at by the GOP. PAYNE: Do we need a deal by July 31? Some are arguing that's an artificial deadline, although we do know that's when those extended benefits expire. ZUMARRAGA: Well, if you look at Speaker Pelosi saying that we definitely need a bill by the end of the month, and Larry Kudlow is pretty optimistic. He's running Economic Council over at the White House. PAYNE: Right. ZUMARRAGA: But then you have House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy saying, oh, we might not get it by the end of the month. But I think those 52 million Americans that have filed for unemployment do want some type of extension. PAYNE: I think so too. And I think we saw the market, the Dow off over 300 points. ZUMARRAGA: Yes. PAYNE: It will down a lot more than that, putting a lot of pressure on all those folks. ZUMARRAGA: Oh, yes. PAYNE: Heather, thank you very much. Appreciate it. ZUMARRAGA: Thanks, Charles. PAYNE: All right, folks, with tensions with China flaring up, now Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is about to deliver a major speech smacking them down. Where is this showdown heading? We will be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) \u00a0PAYNE: You're looking live at the White House. President Trump is about to hold a news conference on reopening schools, among other things. When he takes the podium, we will take you there. Meanwhile, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo about to speak at the Richard Nixon Presidential Library in Yorba Linda, California, as tensions continued to rise between the United States and China. Rich Edson on what Secretary Pompeo is saying -- Rich. RICH EDSON, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Hi. Good evening, Charles. And Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is going to justify the U.S. closing the Chinese Consulate in Houston because he says it was a hub of spying and intellectual property theft. That's according to the prepared remarks for the secretary's speech that he's about to give at the Nixon Presidential Library in Yorba Linda, California. The secretary mentions President Nixon's historic 1972 visit to China and says engagement with the Chinese government has since failed to live up to the change Nixon had hoped to create. He says democracies must abandon blind engagement with China and -- quote -- \"General Secretary Xi Jinping is a true believer in a bankrupt totalitarian ideology. We can no longer ignore the fundamental political and ideological differences between our countries.\" Pompeo floats the creation of an international alliance of democracies to induce change in China's government. Just yesterday, the State Department ordered the Chinese government to vacate its consulate in Houston. China is warning the U.S. to reverse that decision, and, if not, promising to retaliate. The FBI claims China's consulate in San Francisco is protecting a Chinese researcher who prosecutors have charged with lying about her military background to get a visa to come to the United States. State Department officials say there's been a marked increase in Chinese spying activity in the United States over the past few years. And in just the past month, there has been a significant deterioration in U.S.-China relations. The United States has authorized and enacted sanctions on Chinese government officials and businesses that were involved in massive human rights abuses in Northwest Xinjiang, China, and, of course, revoking that special trading status that Hong Kong once enjoyed -- Charles. PAYNE: Rich, thank you very much. And you're looking live, as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is going to give the speech right now, this, of course, as China is threatening retaliation for the closure of its Houston consulate, while it harbors what the U.S. says is a military-linked fugitive in San Francisco. So, where's all this going? I want to go to former State Department senior adviser Christian Whiton, who joins us now. Certainly, the cold war is heating up, Christian. What's the next step? CHRISTIAN WHITON, FORMER U.S. DEPUTY SPECIAL ENVOY: Well, the next step is waiting to see what the Chinese will do. This looks like the U.S. ratcheting up tensions, but what really it is, is, frankly, just the U.S. finally getting its head in the game. President Trump throughout his administration has been tough on China, particularly on trade, trying to bring some equity and some fairness to that relationship and putting tariffs on more than half of what we import from China. But the political pushback on the criminal realm and now the diplomatic realm has been a little slower coming, but now it's coming full force. What Secretary Pompeo is going to say today really is, frankly, Reaganesque. It's language we haven't really seen this starkly from the administration, so I think a good turn. But as for the embassy -- or -- excuse me -- the consulate closure in Houston, the Chinese presumably will retaliate. PAYNE: Right. WHITON: I sort of doubt their ability to retaliate as strongly, but that's probably coming. PAYNE: So, when they said Houston consulate was a hub of spying and I.P. theft, no one's surprised, per se, and yet they keep feigning this, wow, you guys are pushing us around. And I think, to a certain extent, Christian, they get a lot of help from the U.S. media, which seems to take China's side or seems to be sympathetic that President Trump once again pushing China around. Isn't it about time we took this kind of stand? WHITON: Absolutely, it is. But, absolutely, you're right that our media, the mainstream media, is doing China's bidding. The Washington Post editor who covers east Asia yesterday said this move to close the consulate was just President Trump trying to distract from coronavirus. Well, The Washington Post actually takes money from China Daily, millions of dollars to run content from China Daily in its newspaper. That is a propaganda organ of the Chinese government. PAYNE: Right. WHITON: So, you can understand why maybe The Washington Post isn't as excited about this. But you're seeing, I think, a very strong turn in the executive branch and also on Capitol Hill, where you have bipartisan support for a tougher approach on China. And Senator James Risch, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, just introducing a new bill today that would codify a lot of what President Trump has been talking about. PAYNE: Right. Christian, it's so appropriate this is at the Richard Nixon Library. In 1972, our GDP was 900 percent higher than China's. Last year, it was 30 percent higher. All that theft has paid off big time for China, in addition to not having to live by the same trade rules as everyone else. WHITON: It has. And, if President Nixon were alive today, I think he would be in favor of reevaluating the opening of China that he commenced back in 1973. And Henry Kissinger, who is alive today and who did recently meet with President Trump, I think would also be in favor of taking a look. PAYNE: Right. WHITON: When we engaged China first, the idea was to separate from the Soviet Union. And we did. And that was effective. But we're in a very different environment today. PAYNE: Yes, a lot has changed since 1972. Christian, always appreciate it. Thank you, my friend. WHITON: Thank you, Charles. PAYNE: Hey, folks, real quick, did you see this, Lady Liberty standing tall as lightning strikes, as she is fully charging? You know what? So am I. You got to check me out every weekday 2:00 p.m. on FOX Business. You do not want to miss \"Making Money.\" It's my main job, but, sometimes, I have got to save your money as well.

I'm Jesse Watters, along with Greg Gutfeld, Juan Williams, Dana Perino, and Kennedy. It is 5:00 in New York City, and this is The Five. President Trump ripping into Democrats and calling out the Supreme Court after a pair of his decisions on taxes, the high court ruling the president does not have absolute immunity from prosecution, and that a New York district attorney can subpoena his tax returns. And then a separate case, the Supreme Court blocking House Democrats from getting their hands-on Trump's financial records for now. Both of those cases are being thrown back to lower courts. Here is the president's reaction. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: This is a political witch hunt the likes of which nobody has ever seen before. it's a pure witch hunt. It's a hoax just like the Mueller investigation is a hoax that I won. And this is another hoax. This is purely political. I win at the federal level, and we won very decisively and so they sent it in to New York. And you know what's going on in New York. Everyone is leaving. It has turned out to be hell hole. And they better do something about it because People are leaving New York. it's a political witch hunt that just continues. (END VIDEO CLIP) WATTERS: And Nancy Pelosi responding to the rulings by vowing to keep investigating the president. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA): We have a path that the Supreme Court has laid out that we certainly will not ignore. And we will never stop our oversight. This isn't so much about the president's records, although we would like to know, you know, how Russia funded his operation all those years. But that's not what is at stake. What is at stake is the president above the law. (END VIDEO CLIP) WATTERS: All right. Kennedy, here is what I don't like about this. They are going to get their hands on these tax returns, and then they're just going to leak them. And then you are back to the whole Russia thing where these mysterious people are leaking things. You don't know if it's true or not. And then it just spins up a lot of fake news and speculation. It's pretty unfair. LISA KENNEDY MONTGOMERY, FOX NEWS HOST: Well, it's interesting because I think more information is better. I would like to see everyone's tax returns who wants to be the most powerful person in the world. I don't have a problem with that. I do have a problem with the overt politicization. And that's what the Supreme Court blocked today. And they made note that this is what the framers wanted to make sure didn't overtake the branches of government. And they didn't want the Congress to be able to hectare (ph) the president with superfluous requests. And so they did block that. But also what you have to see here is, you know, this was not a slim majority. This was a 7-2 ruling in two cases that were lumped together here. And Gorsuch and Kavanaugh were two Justices that although they agreed with the majority opinion, they also made note that the president should have some claims to block certain requests in the lower court. And, you know, to your point about leaking the process through the lower courts now may take so much time that if the president is worried about these things being known before the November election. Because it's going back and has a restart, that may be politically favorable to him. WATTERS: Juan, why do guys you have to keep hectoring the president with superfluous requests? JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS HOST: Well, you know, at first, I just want to say I thought Kennedy was on target overall. I mean, the key thing here for the president in the short term is that his taxes will not likely be out in public before the November election. So in the short term, I think, you know, although we saw him with his hands across his chest looking very defensive and talking about Obama and the witch hunts. I think if you're looking at it politically, Jesse, he really came out on top in terms of the Congress not having immediate access to the records. But in the long term, I think the big ticket here is that you have a conservative Supreme Court saying very clearly that in terms of prosecution, in terms of investigation, that the president is not above the law. That everybody, every American, including the president, has to respond to legal subpoenas and actions in that regard. And I think that's something that goes beyond the political moment, goes beyond. The president said he was -- could not be investigated, couldn't be prosecuted, could shoot a man on Fifth Avenue. He even said he could pardon himself. Well, here is a Supreme Court saying that's not the case, Mr. President. No kings around here. WATTERS: I don't know if that's exactly what the ruling stated, but that's neither here nor there. Dana, how do you see this SCOTUS ruling? DANA PERINO, FOX NEWS HOST: It's hard for me to see anything because you are not wearing a tie and I don't understand why. WATTERS: It's a long story. I don't have enough time to get into all of that. PERINO: I'm so thrown off that I am flabbergasted. OK, so this decision might have been a huge bang to the end of the Supreme Court session. Instead, it's just a little bit of a whimper. And that's because of all of the things that have already been said. Te White House press secretary today in her briefing, she described the decisions as a win for the president. And I thought that that was -- I thought it was skilful the way that she handled those questions. And also, she is a lawyer, so it really helps. And I think that that was the best way to do it. And I would not talk about this much more because this is not going to happen before the election. What did this insure is that there's going to be a lot more litigation going forward. What Andy McCarthy and John Yu (ph), two intellectual legal scholars that we all listen to, one of the things they said is it might be a political win for the president today. But it was a drastic, terrible decision for the presidency, the office of the presidency. Because going forward, this basically means that any U.S. attorney that wants to basically drag any sitting president into court is going to be allowed to do so. So there is some caution there. But I think overall for the president, I -- not a bad day. WATTERS: Yeah. I mean, Greg, you have told me in the greenroom many times that's one of the reasons you're not running for the presidency because you just don't want to have your taxes exposed to the American people. You have a very complex tax return. And you just don't want Americans to see that. GREG GUTFELD, FOX NEWS HOST: Yeah. There are a lot of unusual medical deductions that I take. And it would just confuse the public. By the way, Dana, I will tell you why Jesse is not wearing a tie, great news. They are rebooting Falcon Crest. And Jesse is playing Lorenzo Lamas' role. I think his name was Lance Cumson. (CROSSTALK) GUTFELD: Please do. Please do. (CROSSTALK) GUTFELD: We don't see enough of that manly chest. PERINO: I'm so distracted. (CROSSTALK) WATTERS: I will button it back up. GUTFELD: Yes. There you go. Here's the deal. I will make two points. The fact is Trump won the presidency. He was given -- and we know this. But he was choice beforehand. Release your taxes and potentially, potentially muck up the campaign. Don't release them. And if you lose, nobody cares. And if you win, great, you won and we can deal with that problem later about not releasing the taxes. So this is very smart strategy from 2016 to just say let's just see what happens. Now, it also pays to point out what energizes the media. They are always consumed by any potential avenue of muck regarding people who don't share their assumptions. So everybody becomes a Woodward and Bernstein around the people they hate. But imagine if the media had been this energized about Harvey Weinstein 10 years ago or Jeffrey Epstein 10 years ago of the decay of Democratic cities, 20, 30 years ago or just recently, the scandalous rest home deaths or baby Hunter Biden's enriching himself off his dad. Or who push the Steele dossier? I mean, we haven't heard about the Steele dossier, the Clinton-funded author of it. Christopher Steele has been ordered to pay damage on the dossier lies. So the bottom line here is media bias isn't always about the stories that the media chases. It's the stories they pretend that don't exist. WATTERS: That's a good point. So why doesn't the president maybe just acid wash his returns, because that's what Hillary did and no one really seemed to care. GUTFELD: There you go. WATTERS: Sleepy Joe Biden now ripping off one of Trump's signature campaign promises. Greg has a monologue on that next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) GUTFELD: You know what makes me sick, all this America first crap from Donald Trump. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: When the federal government spends taxpayers' money commit, we should use it to buy American products and support American jobs. During my first term alone, we will invest $400 billion. The products and materials our country needs to modernize our infrastructure. (END VIDEO CLIP) GUTFELD: Wait, wait, wait. Did he just say use it to buy American products? I wonder where he got that idea. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: In my administration, we live by two simple rules. Buy American and hire American. Buy American and hire American. Buy American and hire American. I've been saying buy American ever since I announced I was running for office and long before that. (END VIDEO CLIP) GUTFELD: True. Well, maybe that wasn't such a bad idea after all, Mr. Trump, another one of those nasty (ph) moments when he turns out to be right all along. Just wait until Biden asks for a wall. So the rest of us have caught up to Trump. For example, we now realize China is engaging in war against America. And it's not a cold one but a sleek lab built hot war that destroys an economy and disrupts political life with a weapon more modern than a bomb. And minus the messy retaliation, but I thought Joe was known for sticking to his guns. I mean, it was just days ago that he was barely able to say this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BIDEN: This guy's whole idea of America -- America on its own has been America alone. We are out there by ourselves. (END VIDEO CLIP) GUTFELD: How can you not remember the second word in America first? And Sorry, Joe, creating a policy that stresses buying American goods over not American goods is actually putting America first. But I get it. He's got a lot on his mind. Plus, it's all covered with plugs. I mean, what does Lonnie know? (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BIDEN: Lonnie knows -- I believe this every fiber of my being. We're posed -- what I propose is it can be done. I think we are in a position to really make it happen. And my team and your team are already working closely together to light up the path forward here. Critical laws like the pro- actors, collective bargaining. On politics like prevailing and -- look, yes, I'm getting -- I'm taking too much time. (END VIDEO CLIP) GUTFELD: Yes, you are. I have no idea what he just said. Love or hate Trump, his sentences actually connect two dots often loudly. But Joe's words are just like Joe, always in danger of wandering off into the woods. But maybe that's the strategy. You can't criticize what cannot be deciphered. So text Joe at 1-888 -- I forgot the rest. Where's my soup? So Jesse, you once said that why should you vote for Joe Biden if Joe Biden is going to be a Trump light? Is this is an example of him being Trump-like? WATTERS: Yeah. I mean, he plagiarized buy American, hire American basically. It wouldn't be the first time Joe Biden plagiarized in politics. But I don't care. I think it's actually great that both candidates from both parties have a more economic, nationalist, populist approach to the U.S. economy. So if Biden moves to the right on this, good. It moves the conversation in the right direction because this is where the conversation is going. It's going to be a less multilateral world. We're going to have more of a kind of a gunboat mercantilism, if you guys know what I'm talking about, where we're going to protect our own shipping with our own Navy and not protect the entire world's free trade with our Navy. Those days are over. The cold war is kind of crumbling. And we are kind of getting back to American first. And Trump was right about it. Now, Joe is going far left on the environment, and he's gone far left on the de-fund police. So I honestly don't know where Joe is at any given moment, and neither does he. GUTFELD: Lorenzo dropping the mercantile in the response. Juan, so now we have two Republicans running for president. That's got to be good news. WILLIAMS: Right. You can't say that he's (INAUDIBLE) left wing. But here's my take on this. You know, President Trump's ratings are pretty low right now. They've gone down. But the one area in which he still polls very well and gets the approval of the American people in his ability to handle economic issues. People see him as someone who can do that. And I think Joe Biden and his campaign are speaking to that strength right now in saying, well, let's look at manufacturing. Let's look at mining. Let's look at some of the issues like farming. Has that gotten better? Has President Trump lived up to all the promises that he made about reviving those economic sectors and saying no. And if you elect Joe Biden, Joe Biden says, he, in fact will make real on those promises -- those failed promises that came from Donald Trump. That's a big difference to offer a positive vision. And I think the slogan they have is build back better. And I think what it is saying, hey, I can really deliver on the economy where the incumbent has not -- doing it. It's a positive agenda. And I think, you know, you think back to the tax cuts, the whole thing that led to buybacks for the big corporations that enrich the very rich in our country, didn't bring back wages or jobs. And I think he is saying that was a failed economic package. And here is an opportunity to actually really bring to life what President Trump had been talking about. So it's not plagiarism. It's saying let's actually do it and get it done. GUTFELD: You know, Dana, who knew that Joe Biden is a jingoistic white nationalist? PERINO: Look, think about where he gave his speech today -- Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania's going to be the main battleground state, I think, coming up in these 3.5 months when -- on Election Day. And so Joe Biden is -- has some work to do, especially in these counties where he was today. I understand that voter registration for Democrats is about down 20 percent. So if he wants to try to find voters who went from Obama to Trump, and he wants to try to get them back to his corner, he has work to do. And so that's one of the reasons that you saw him go out there and do this today. The other thing that happened is that Bernie Sanders invited and have working -- their staffs have been working on these committees to try to figure out where might they be able to agree. And instead of moving to the center, as general election candidates usually do, Joe Biden continues to move more to the left. Maybe not on this economic issue in particular, but I think that Bernie Sanders would be very comfortable with buy American, hire American. Like, that's, like, that's his whole world. The other thing is that Biden -- as soon as he -- as soon as the Trump campaign starts to focus on pushing him to where he is and say he's so far left. And he's going to go even further left, he likes what Bernie likes. He wants to give healthcare to illegal immigrants. He's going to do The Green New Deal all the way. We're going to eliminate all these jobs in Pennsylvania. Just relentlessly focusing on how Biden will actually be beholden to the left seems to me to be where the Trump campaign should try to focus in the next few weeks. GUTFELD: What do you think, Kennedy? MONTGOMERY: I'm not a big fan of populism on either side. But it's especially dangerous when it comes from the left because it breeds this authoritarianism. And then the economy is really going to go down the toilet, because what they are going to do is have these federal mandates on what you can buy and who you can buy it from. It's not just a sense of goodwill that I want to help out American manufacturers and workers and Americans who have great idea and buy their products and services. It is going to be done by force. So when you increase spending, they're also going to increase taxes. There is no greater certain way to tank the economy than to marry those two devils. And that's what Joe Biden is doing with this. And when he's working in concert with Bernie Sanders, who is a devout socialist, it is horrible news for the economy. And I think the more Biden moves up in the polls, the worst it's going to be for the markets. And they're really going to start reacting to that. And also, it's always -- Dana can tell you this. It's always a great idea to steal whatever is working from your opponent. But if the president were to steal something from Joe Biden -- what is it. What is his phrase or his idea? Or the foundation of ideology that is so populist and is working so well that the president would want to borrow from that? I can't think of anything. GUTFELD: Yeah, neither can Joe. Ahead, Beto O'Rourke now blaming Republicans for the surge in violence in liberal cities, that's next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) WILLIAMS: Welcome back. Beto O'Rourke causing controversy for suggesting Republicans are to blame for the recent rise in violence in American cities. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BETO O'ROURKE (D), FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: If you look at the gun laws that are on the books and the gun laws that should be on the books and aren't in this country. In some way, we have tacitly accepted this historic, tragic level of gun violence in America that continues to rise. We saw that just over the weekend in many American cities. It's that same kind of death cult mentality that ask us to accept one quarter, 25 percent of the world's COVID cases, one quarter, 25 percent of the world's COVID deaths, though we represent only four percent of the globe's population. (END VIDEO CLIP) WILLIAMS: And Attorney General Bill Barr, he is saying all black lives should matter after an increase in violence. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BILL BARR, U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL: Obviously, black lives matter. I think all human life is sacred. And also think that it's being used now as sort of distorting the debate to some extent because it's used really to refer exclusively to black lives that are lost to police misconduct, which have been going down statistically. Five years ago, there were 40 such incidents. This last year, it was 10. So at least it's a positive trajectory there. But then you compare to 8,000 homicides in the African American community. Those are black lives that mattered too. (END VIDEO CLIP) WILLIAMS: Greg, can you agree with Beto O'Rourke that even after the big shootings in Newtown, in Vegas and promises from President Trump. Little has been done to deal with gun violence and easy access to guns in America. GUTFELD: You know, this is a really -- this violence explosion is an incredibly serious topic. And Beto is not a serious person. He is the poster child for petulant stupidity. He is the actual opposite of wisdom. So he should not be taken seriously at all. So here is a serious explanation for this problem. We have it all backwards, right? It's not about cops. It's about crime, OK? Crime requires -- crime in inner cities, the black on black crime requires police involvement. Police involvement means more stops, right, more stops. They end up becoming more engaged with young, black men. And more stops create more opportunity for incidents, especially in high crime areas where compliance is a big challenge. So the media pushes this idea that it's police misconduct and police brutality, when the real issue is the crime and the police dealing with the crime and the number the sheer number of police stops, which then makes the incident of the incident percentage drop. It's not as big as the media says it's because it's such a vast number of police stops. So it's about the crime, it's not about the cops. I know you look confused right now Juan, but you can play the show back later and play it really slow, and it'll all make sense to you, and then you'll smile for once when I'm talking. WILLIAMS: OK. Kennedy, you know, the attorney general -- the attorney general was saying in that interview that in Kansas City where they've seen a surge in violence, especially homicides, mostly gun related over the last half a year or so, they're going to work with the mayor and the governor to put in more cops for a 10-day period. Do you think more cops would stop that? MONTGOMERY: Stop a surge of violence that seems to be momentary. It certainly can. But this is what I was talking about. This is what I've been saying for weeks and weeks. When there is a perception that there will be no consequences for your actions, and you have a bunch of people who are out of work, they are frustrated, and they are bored, and now they are angry, and now they're on a mission, and they think the cops aren't going to do anything, yes, they're going to -- they're going to go out and they're going to cause some problems. So there has to be a shift in perception. And that's going to mean more cops, not less. So the whole deform the police movement, it has -- the foundation there is so incredibly shaky that it's going to fall apart and it's going to bring about the exact opposite of what it purports to want. And as far as Beto O'Rourke, he -- all he does is snack on fallacies. He's not a senator, he's not going to be president, he probably won't be anywhere near the Biden ministration if the former vice president wins, but he still can't put two cogent points together to make a logical argument about anything. So he's saying the democratically run cities are somehow subject to a Republican death cult mentality that is then perversely tied to COVID cases. None of that makes sense. He needs to stop talking. WILLIAMS: Dana, in New York City, they say there's a surge in police seeking to retire. Do you think there'd be any trouble replacing them in the current economy? PERINO: Well, sure, because the other thing that I believe that the defund the police movement did was it froze the recruitment for a year. So yes, that's going to be a problem. You need really good cops to be training. The -- what do you call them? They're not freshmen -- rookie cops, rookie cops. Sorry, I'm like, cadets, I don't know. I'm like -- I'm like that other candidate that we've been talking about all day. And now I've got it in my ear as well. All right, the other thing I was going to say is don't forget that Joe Biden has said that he would lean on Beto O'Rourke for his gun policy. Again, another issue that we've been talking about, like showing that the left is going really far to the left. That's what you would end up with. The other thing I wanted to mention about this, is it's been on my mind, is a really distressing editorial in the Wall Street Journal yesterday, about a lot of the business owners, all minorities that are in Minneapolis, whose businesses were ruined and destroyed their merchandise set on fire, things just absolutely destroyed, and they've had zero help. And that fund to that -- all the celebrities poured in millions of dollars, it's like up to $30 million to bail out people that were arrested during the rioting and the looting, there's so $30 million in that account, but nobody's thinking about going to help these business owners. And I think that when -- I think what Attorney General Bill Barr is saying is that, yes, all black lives matter, right? You could say all lives matter, black lives matter, but all black lives matter, and those people deserve our help as well. WILLIAMS: Jesse, I wanted to pick up on Dana's language there because Bill Barr, the Attorney General said, black lives matter but all lives matter. I wonder if he understands how that strikes lots of ears as weakening the focus on racial justice at this moment in terms of trying to repair damage being done to black lives. WATTERS: I don't think he cares about slogans. I just think he cares about human life. And Juan, you really should go back and watch the shows to listen to Greg. I have started doing that myself because half the stuff he says goes over my head, it really sinks in a second time. So, I highly recommend it. But in terms of Beto O'Rourke, I don't think there's no other country in the entire world that puts such a high value on human life as we do in the United States of America. From the pro-life movement to like the fact that we shut down the greatest economy in the world just to save lives, to the to the fact that some guy goes hiking in some canyon and gets lost and we scramble like 13 helicopters to the tune of 350 grand to go rescue the guy. The hostages we bring back all over the world, or like there's one single terror attack, and then we just go ballistic all across the Middle East as a reaction to that. Like, this country loves each and every life and goes to great lengths to protect it. So I think Beto O'Rourke doesn't know what the heck he's talking about there. WILLIAMS: Wow. Well, I think -- I think there could be a long debate about that one because I think lots of people feel like we've had an ongoing problem with so many of that the crime in the inner cities in black on black, you know, homicide. Coming up, college football may be benched this fall. We're going to tell you all about it and about a key warning sign that just happened next on THE FIVE. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) KENNEDY: It's a bad omen for college sports fans desperate to see a little competition this fall. The Ivy League is canceling its athletic calendar. So Greg, you and I both are products of the U.C. system, where you know we are looked down upon academically in terms of, you know, intellectual richness. The Ivy League, yes, that's where the hoity toity kids go. So are they being sensitive in terms of canceling their schedule? GUTFELD: Well, the bad news is the Ivy League canceled all their sports. The good news is no one knew they had sports. I didn't know they had teams. I hope there are people at home very upset that I say that. Why do they switch to playing things that you can play online? Like poker or compete in Grand Theft Auto or Call of Duty? That's what everybody else is doing. KENNEDY: Yes, electronic sports. That's where the shift may be, Dana. And we've also seen there are schools like Stanford and Dartmouth that have cut out entire programs permanently. Stanford just eliminated 11 sports at that school. What does that say about where we are with the economy? PERINO: Yes. I feel bad for all -- I feel bad for the students and also, I'm a little worried about the economy when there's a lot of money that goes into sports. And you know, the Big Ten also is just announced a reduction in their schedule, and I think that's just because they will do anything to get a leg up on the SEC, and the SEC wins all the national titles. The Big ten can't even handle anything. So that's why you're seeing people take advantage of the situation to try to improve their position reputationally. KENNEDY: Yes. And I wouldn't be surprised to see the PAC 12 do the same thing, Juan, because that really is the sleeper league. But this is something in -- there's such purity in college sports, and this is what we've been looking forward to. A lot of programs said they're not going to decide until late July. Should we just call off all of 2020? WILLIAMS: Wow, you know, I'd be disappointed. I'm a big sports fan, Kennedy. But I must say sports is part of life. And so, when you look at people trying to get sports going right now, Major League Soccer is back in gear, but already we've seen the Dallas team, I think it's the Nashville team, and the women's Orlando team have all had to pull back because there was too much of the spread of the virus. And Dr. Fauci says the NFL might not even be able to make it happen this fall. So to me it's kind of disappointing, but you know, sports is life. KENNEDY: Jesse you have no tie, but you do have a crystal ball. What are we going to see between now and the end of the year in terms of sports? WATTERS: I don't know. Dana, I mean, now that the Big Ten has just changed their schedule, so it's just conference games. Who do you think is going to win the Big Ten? PERINO: Is Michigan in the Big Ten? WATTERS: Not bad, not bad. Lucky guess. PERINO: Thank you. WATTERS: Lucky guess. PERINO: Nice try. WATTERS: I had you. I thought I had you. KENNEDY: All right, well, if Jesse seems especially peppy, it's because it's his birthday and we have a very fun surprise ahead to celebrate the man. That's next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) PERINO: All right, it's time now for a very special Jesse Watters' birthday edition of supermarket showdown. All right, we're going to be battling it out over the prices of some of Jesse's favorite items. And whoever guesses the closest without going over wins. First up, you know Jesse is the king of cloth but how does he keep his mane in such pristine condition? We've got some of his hair product. This is hair clay. WATTERS: Yes. PERINO: Hair clay, so write it down, hair clay. WATTERS: I don't even know. PERINO: And let me see if I can see it. We're more socially distanced supermarket showdown. Can you see mine? Right, are you -- nobody cheat. OK, 18. Greg, what does yours say? GUTFELD: $13.50 PERINO: All right, somebody in the control room tell me who wins. GUTFELD: This is working out. PERINO: I won. I won. I swear I didn't Google it. I didn't even know he used hair clay. I didn't even know. It's $26.00. GUTFELD: What was the -- oh, $26.00. PERINO: Wow, Jesse, big spender. I don't even spend that much on my hair. WATTERS: I don't buy it myself. PERINO: All right, the next one is a Jesse statue. Let's see a picture of this, the Jesse statue. WATTERS: Oh, I have -- wait, the life -- the big one or the little one? PERINO: It looks like the little one. WATTERS: I have two statues of myself. PERINO: The big one. The big one. WATTERS: OK, the big one. OK. KENNEDY: Is it functional? GUTFELD: Oh, don't ask, Kennedy. WATTERS: Kennedy. GUTFELD: It's disgusting. PERINO: OK, I put in $125.00 Oh, wow. GUTFELD: I put $14,000. PERINO: $14,000. GUTFELD: $14,000. PERINO: Kennedy wins, $695. Jesse, that is an expensive statue. GUTFELD: I was actually close. PERINO: All right, next we have a Rhoback polo. We know we love this brand. This is a great company the Rhoback Company, a polo. Let's see. What do we think this cost? Let me go with $55.00. I want it in my lighting. GUTFELD: Yes, that's better to do it in single pictures. Now you figured it out. WATTERS: Did I win? PERINO: Jesse wins. WATTERS: What was it? PERINO: Jesse, have you ever paid for one? WATTERS: Yes, Dana. I have. Thanks. PERINO: All right. The other thing we know he loves is a facial. WATTERS: What? PERINO: How much is a facial, a 60-minute facial? WATTERS: How do you know that? Oh yes. PERINO: Don't you remember? WATTERS: I get one BBQ facial in Dallas, one time, years ago. I never lived that day. PERINO: No one will ever forget. WATTERS: All right. PERINO: All right, no one is ever going to forget, Jesse. All right, all right, Jesse wins. WATTERS: Yes. PERINO: $165.00. WATTERS: I definitely paid for that one. PERINO: Jesse, you know yourself so well. WATTERS: I know my facials, Dana. PERINO: All right, there's the next one. I mean, you look -- you look amazing. WATTERS: Thank you. PERINO: I was going to ask you your secret. The last thing is a signed picture of Jesse Watters. What is that -- the cost of that? What is the cost of a signed picture of Jesse Watters? GUTFELD: He pays you. I think he pays you. WATTERS: Priceless. WILLIAMS: Hey, Dana and I had the same price. WATTERS: Very good. PERINO: Jesse and I both put priceless. WATTERS: That's right. WILLIAMS: That's what I put. PERINO: Oh, and Juan too. Great, it's great. And Jesse -- WATTERS: Did I win? PERINO: Jesse won. WATTERS: Yes. PERINO: Of course, it's his birthday. You also win a little something that I think is going to be delivered to you right now as we are on the air. It's a little cupcake. WATTERS: Thank you. Here we go, a chocolate cupcake. No candle. No candle. PERINO: Happy Birthday, Jesse. We love you. WATTERS: Thank you. I'm making a wish. I'm making a wish. PERINO: \"ONE MORE THING\" is up next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) WATTERS: It's time now for \"ONE MORE THING.\" Incredible lifesaving catch at a Phoenix, Arizona. A former wide receiver college football player Philip Banks. Look at these hands. Roll it. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Throw the baby now. (END VIDEO CLIP) WATTERS: That's right. So he sprints to the scene. The baby is thrown off the third-floor balcony, saves the baby's life, brings the baby to safety. Philip Banks, what a hero. Maybe the Eagles could use him. We definitely need someone with hands. All right -- and thank you for my birthday, everybody. Dana, you're next. PERINO: You're welcome. That was a great \"ONE MORE THING,\" Jesse. What an amazing video. You may have heard Charlie Daniels, the just incredible music legend passed away this week. And just about three weeks before he died, our own John Rich had a chance to interview him for his show called \"THE PURSUIT\" with John Rich. Here's a little bit of that interview. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CHARLIE DANIELS, SINGER: My dad didn't play an instrument but he dearly love music. And we were constantly listening to the radio and I used to sing with my dad. He taught me how to sing harmony. We ran along his car and he's singing old songs. (END VIDEO CLIP) PERINO: So you're going to be able to see that on Fox Nation, which is a great place to find all sorts of things. But this in particular is so special, his last interview. And Charlie reflects on a life well-lived and on his journey to pursue the American dream. So check that out. WATTERS: All right, check it out, everybody. Greg Gutfeld. GUTFELD: Let's do this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GUTFELD: Animals are great. Animals are great. Animals are great. (END VIDEO CLIP) GUTFELD: Oh, we got a good one. We got a great one today. I'm so excited. I'm so excited. There's nothing better than tickling a bush baby. Look at that. Look at that bush baby. It loves -- and then you stop, and then it wants to be tickled some more. I don't think there's an animal cuter than a bush baby. And I want to know what the downside is to owning a bush baby. Like, is there something we don't know? Like it's a spit fire or does it poop all over there -- your bed? Like -- but never mind. But anyway, that's a bush baby being tickled and it loves. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GUTFELD: Animals are great. Animals are great. Animals are great. (END VIDEO CLIP) GUTFELD: Look at that. I could watch this for days. Yes, they are. WATTERS: We're actually going to have Johnny getting me a bush baby. Johnny, if you're listening, I want one. Juan, you're up. WILLIAMS: All right, so put me in coach. I want to show off my Gray's t shirt from the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum in Kansas City, Missouri. This year is the 100th anniversary of the Negro Leagues. Major League Baseball planned a big celebration, but the virus obviously abbreviated the season. By the way, that's scheduled to start later this month. So now, former Yankee CC Sabathia, the pitcher, and the Major League Baseball Players Association, have joined with clothing company Roots of Fight to put together a clothing line in honor of iconic black baseball players. The profits will go to the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum and the estate of legendary players like Jackie Robinson, as well as the Black Lives Movement. Sabathia is encouraging people to take a trip out to Kansas City to celebrate the past of baseball and to motivate minority youth today to play the game. WATTERS: It sounds like a great idea. Kennedy, take us home. KENNEDY: I love that shirt. All right, birthday boy. So, one of the things that has gotten many people through the pandemic, through the lockdown has been a little bit of Chardonnay and Pinot Noir. But sometimes if you don't have any wine in your house, what are you to do? Well, look at the wine fairies. They have wings, they have two twos, they sprouted up in Raleigh, North Carolina. There are now 10 states that have wine fairy chapters, and they parade around neighborhoods taking bottles of spirits and good cheer to their friends and they brighten the community with some bubbles, red, white, and all the rosy in between. The wine fairies are really doing a tremendous job. WATTERS: And ironic because that was Gutfeld's nickname in college.

We have a big announcement coming tonight.And, by the way, we also want you to call all your Democratic friends right now, ask them to learn the real, ugly truth about Joe Biden. Joe Biden hit a new low today and also confusing moments again. We will expose the entire truth that the mob will never tell you.Joe, it's time we give America a history lesson about you. That's coming tonight.But first, we start with the carnage in Chicago, chaos in Portland, violent crime surging in nearly every major city in America. Democratic mayors, Democratic governors, they have failed in their most basic duty, and that is the most basic responsibility, to maintain law and order. They have failed and people are dying and being shot as a result.They have failed to keep their neighborhood safe. They have failed to prevent violent crime. As a result, men, women and children are dying. Our fellow Americans are dying.These mayors are literally twiddling their thumbs and playing politics. Philadelphia's top prosecutor is now vowing to arrest any federal law enforcement agents that are sent to the city.But President Trump is taking action. Today in a major press conference, he announced the expansion of what's called Operation LeGend. That's a federal program. It started in Kansas City and was named after a 4-year-old boy who was killed by gunfire while asleep in his own bed.Well, they'll now send more than 100 federal officers to Chicago, 35 to Albuquerque without having a problem in order to help take violent criminals off of the streets. The mayors aren't doing it. The governors aren't doing it.Listen to the president.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: The citizens of Chicago are citizens of America and they have the same right as every other American to live in safety, dignity and peace. No mother should ever have to cradle her dead child in her arms simply because politicians refused to do what is necessary to secure their neighborhood and to secure their city.Every American, no matter their income, race, or their zip code, should be able to walk the city streets free from violence and free from fear.For this reason today, I am announcing the Department of Justice will immediately surge federal law enforcement to the city of Chicago. The FBI, ATF, DEA, U.S. Marshals Service and Homeland Security will together be sending hundreds of skilled law enforcement officers to Chicago to help drive down violent crime.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: Safety, security is the foundation for our great American dream. Every child, every neighborhood, every city deserves to be safe. You can't climb the ladder of opportunity without security and safety.This president committed to making serious progress all over the country.Let's go back to his conference earlier today.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: My vision for America's cities could not be more different from the lawlessness being pushed by the extreme radical left. While others want to defund, defame, and abolish the police, I want to support and honor our great police.We want to build factories in Baltimore, not Beijing. We want to make our products in Chicago, not Shanghai. We want the American dream for American children, and I will fight to deliver that dream every ounce -- every single ounce of my strength, I will be fighting.But opportunity cannot thrive where there's violence, prosperity cannot flourish where there's bloodshed, and security cannot exist where there are violent criminals who are able to maim and murder with impunity. That is what Operation Legend is all about.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: \"Operation Legend\" is a beginning. It's greatly needed in all of these cities.Now, 100 agents, they cannot save and protect these cities. They can't. They can protect, well, federal property, they can help in investigations, they can get to underlying groups that are fomenting this violence.But unless and until these reckless, irresponsible Democratic mayors and governors do their job and/or allow the help they are being offered, they are allowing innocent people to die. That is all on them. New York, Chicago, Philly, Baltimore, you name the city, Seattle, Portland, it's all on them.Especially true in Chicago. Shootings were up 47 percent over last year, homicides up by a whopping 51 percent, 70 shot last weekend, 63 the weekend before, even children dying every single week. The violence reaches catastrophic levels.By the way, last night, we reported on that horrific mass shooting in the south side of Chicago. Fifteen people seriously wounded outside of a funeral home in what appears to be a gun-related incident. At least 60 shell casings recovered from the scene, caught on camera by nearby surveillance system.Take a look.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)(GUNSHOTS)(SCREAMING)(GUNSHOTS)(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: Mayor Lightweight isn't doing anything to protect her city.Moments later, two visibly shaken witnesses compared it to a war zone, as the president has been calling this and applauded the president's plan, please help us. Please send in.Well, the mayor and the governor won't let him do that. Take a look.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We wish it would stop. And we're glad the federal troops are here in Chicago because the violence is literally just as bad as it was as the Pandora, the Pandoran (INAUDIBLE). So, I mean, we need more cops and federal troops, because there's literally like we're in Iraq or something.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes, it feels like, we're -- at a war, in a war.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: As this devastating scene unfolding, sadly, typical night, Chicago's Mayor Lori Lightfoot who is a lightweight in terms of protecting people, busy on Twitter. What was she doing? Bashing President Trump, tweeting: Under no circumstances will I allow Donald Trump's troops to come to Chicago and terrorize our residents.She clearly hates the president more than she cares about innocent men, women and children in her city. Rahm \"Dead Fish\" Emanuel, he didn't do anything either. Barack Obama's president, barely mentioned Chicago, 1,000 shot, 1,000 died. Biden did nothing.At that point, when will these liberal mayors and governors, when do we hold them accountable for not protecting innocent people? Hundreds of people shot every week in Chicago and a lot of the cities. Six small children have been killed in July alone.Last night, a 3-year-old little girl was shot in the head, but the mayor is worried about troops terrorizing her city. Really? Now, what has she done to stop the violence? What has she done to save lives?Lightfoot who is a lightweight on protecting citizens seems more worried about optics and politics than the men, women and children that she is supposed to protect and serve. It's a national disgrace.She is not the only Democrat putting politics before human life. In Portland, we see the same thing. Democrats there, they're apoplectic. The federal agents were trying to protect federal buildings from being burned to the ground. That is their right and their job.Portland's mayor calling the federal officers, literally, the officers, not the anarchist, not the people involved in the violence, calling the officers un-American.Oregon's stupid governor floating an insane conspiracy theory that they were abducting people.Pelosi, get this, comparing agents, law enforcement agents who put their lives on the line to protect and serve \"stormtroopers\".Congressman Clyburn, the leadership in the Democratic Party, referring to them as Nazi Gestapo.Meanwhile, corrupt and confused Joe Biden, he's not said a single positive word about law enforcement, the 99th percent, since running for president. He accused federal agents of, quote, brutally attacking peaceful protesters.Now, we have also heard him say that police have become the enemy and he supports the defund effort or as he calls it, we will reallocate sources. He likes that word better.Let's be clear -- anarchist, vandals, have been writing nearly two straight months in downtown Portland. They firebombed the federal courthouse twice. They possibly, permanently blinded federal officers with lasers. Dozens of buildings have been vandalized, lit ablaze.Businesses, they're shutdown. People don't feel safe. These are not peaceful protests, Joe.And here's just a small example of what law enforcement is facing. Take a look.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)(CHANTING)(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: Wait until you see all of the video with Ami Horowitz who's on the ground in Portland as we speak. There have been more than 50 straight days of violent demonstrations in the city's downtown district.Remember, according to Biden, federal law enforcement officials were the real enemy here. See what's happening? Biden doesn't have a plan to stop violence, make America cities safer to protect innocent people so he just trashes Donald Trump.Now, he's even deploying one of the old Democratic Party favorite tactics. He is now playing the race card. I pointed out and I've done this history so many times come, every two years, every four years, like clockwork. Republicans, they are racist, sexists, misogynistic, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamophobic, they want dirty air and water. They want grandma and grandpa to eat dog food, cat food, before Paul Ryan or a Republican Trump look-alike throws granny over a cliff in a wheelchair.And, today, Biden accusing Trump, the president, of being the first racist president in history. Get ready for \"Hannity\" history real lesson in a second.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOE BIDEN, D-PRESUMPTIVE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: You have racists, they've existed and they tried to get elected president. He's the first one that has. And the way he pits people against one another is all designed to divide the country.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: Put y'all back in chains.All right. Now, it's time for a \"Hannity\" history lesson. Forget the fact that Democrats have accused every Republican of being racist. We've gone over -- 1998 radio ad in Missouri, the 2000 James Byrd ad, Al Gore, Republicans don't even want to count you in the census. They will put y'all back in chains.Let's go over the facts. Here's Joe Biden's history.It was Donald Trump, not Joe and not Barack who passed criminal justice reform and prison reform. It was Donald Trump, it wasn't Joe and it was not Barack who signed off on police reform. It was Donald Trump also doing opportunity zones, targeting mostly minority neighborhoods to help -- well, build the economies in neighborhoods that have been left behind by Joe and Barack.It was President Trump, not Joe, not Barack, who ushered in record low after record low after record low unemployment for African-Americans, Hispanic-Americans, Asian-Americans, women in the workplace, youth unemployment, African-American youth unemployment. Joe and Barack, they didn't do any of that.As a matter of fact, 13 million more Americans in food stamps, 8 million more in poverty, lowest labor participation rate in, oh, since the \u201870s. Had a 51-year low in homeownership rate, and the worst recovery since the '40s. That's their eight years of failure.And, by the way, three years in, President Trump has done more for minorities in this country than Joe Biden, Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer did in 125 years.Watch this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: You look at employment, you look at opportunity zones and maybe most importantly, you look at criminal justice reform. You look at prison reform. I've done things that nobody else -- and I've said this and I say it openly, and not a lot of people dispute it, I've done more for black Americans than anybody with the possible exception of Abraham Lincoln. Nobody has even been close.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: The media mob, the biggest contributor to the Biden campaign and all things radical, extreme Democratic socialist, they'll never tell you that.So, you need to ask yourself the question, what was Biden doing during his 50-plus year career in the swamp for African-Americans, other minorities?Here is where it gets interesting. All -- tell all your Democratic friends, we know he was very close and spoke so highly of the former Klansman Robert KKK Byrd, yes, former Klan leader. Biden called the Byrd the dean of the U.S. Senate, a close friend of mine and a mentor. That man filibustered the Civil Rights Act of 1964, that, well, Lyndon Johnson needed 80 percent of Republicans in the House and Senate to get past and most Democrats are opposing it.During a speech, Joe Biden in 1973 praised Democrats in a two-party system in the South that is called, well I'm a good for the -- I won't use the word.Around the same time, Biden was actively working with the segregationists. He didn't want immigration. He opposed school busing. According to NBC News, he led the charge on an initiative to keep black students away from the black students away from white students. That is his record.In \u201877, Biden worried his children, his children, if integration -- would grow up in a, quote, racial jungle if integration is not done in an orderly way, whatever the hell that means.1993, referred to inner-city youth as predators on our streets as he coauthored the most aggressive crime bill that ramped up prison sentences for dozens of crimes specifically targeting in the end minority Americans.In 2006, telling a crowd, well, you have to have a slight Indian accent to work out at 7-Eleven or Dunkin Donuts. I'm not kidding he said.2006, he bragged his state was a slave state.2007, yes, he actually said this about Barack Obama: the first, OK, the first mainstream African-American who is articulate, bright, clean, that story book, man. Wow.Last year, he said, poor kids could be just as bright as white kids. And recently, you ain't black if you don't support Donald Trump. Joe decides that?Joe Biden shouldn't throw stones from that glass house. That mob in the media will never tell you. Better yet, he could just stop saying racist things altogether. Joe, take a look in the mirror.When is anybody in the mob and the media going to ask him about any of these things? Because that's the truth, that's the history. And, by the way, actually knows if Joe Biden can even form a answer to any of these questions.We're going to play his very latest struggles in a moment. It's not good.Joining us now with reaction, FOX News contributor Dan Bongino, Fox News correspondent-at-large, Geraldo Rivera, civil rights attorney, Leo Terrell, Leo 2.0.All right, Leo, let's play a game here except it's not a game because lives matter, right? Let's not play games.LEO TERRELL, CIVIL RIGHTS LAWYER: Yes.HANNITY: Donald Trump set record low after record low unemployment, opportunity zones, the largest and most expensive of long-term commitment to historically black colleges in America -- Joe didn't do that. Criminal justice reform, Joe and Barack didn't do that. Police reform, Joe and Barack didn't do that.So, you tell me, if Donald Trump said the things I just laid out that Biden said, how would African-Americans and how would the media treat Donald Trump?TERRELL: They -- they would simply annihilate him. Let me be very clear to every Democrat on the planet, Donnell J. Trump has done more for black America in three years than the Biden/Obama administration.The reason why I'm here right now, the reason I'm voting for Donald Trump is because Joe Biden went on national radio and said, if you're -- if you vote for Trump, you ain't black. That is insulting. That is racist! Biden is the racist.And what is amazing is, you think you have another dinosaur, Jim Clyburn, who uses terms like Nazis, and Gestapo, he needs to retire. That is insulting to the people who suffer during the holocaust. So you have these old outdated Democrats who are still trying to pander to blacks. Blacks reject this. And with the crime going on in these Democratic cities, it is insulting.Donald Trump is the only person who can resurrect these Democratic cities and save them from lawlessness.But let's be very clear: Joe Biden is a racist, not Donald Trump.HANNITY: OK, Geraldo Rivera, I know how you feel about underprivileged in America, kids of all races. You got a heart of gold. One thing I will say about Geraldo, Dan Bongino knows it, Leo knows it, I know it, heart of gold.Donald Trump said those things, Geraldo, how different would it be in the media today?GERALDO RIVERA, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT-AT-LARGE: Oh, please, they would blow him up. It would be impossible for him to continue it. He's not a racist. I've known him 45 years.Having said that, I don't like that kung flu thing. I wish he would stop that. I think he has.I think there is some sloppy stuff, you know, in recent years that I don't like, but I know him. I know I've been in and out of that Trump Tower 50 times. It is as integrated as any building in this country. He gives opportunity on the basis of competence. Not skin color.And for Biden to say he is the first racist ever elected, that shows how disconnected Joe Biden is. 12 United States presidents were slaveholders. Joe should do a little research before he makes flamboyant charge like that, so unhinged from reality. Nixon, LBJ used language far more salty and you would argue, in today's standards, racist.This man is a good-hearted man and I really do believe that in terms of the economic opportunity zones and the criminal justice reform, he really has done more than any recent president for integration and the advancement of everybody regardless of their race, color, religion. You know that, Sean.HANNITY: And, Dan, this is what it comes down to too -- slogans, bumper stickers, symbolism. I'll take the substance. I'll take the jobs. I'll take the opportunity zones. I will take the money for historically black colleges.I'll take the results over the rhetoric. Every two years, every four years, Dan Bongino, Republicans are racist, sexist, my whole list.BONGINO: Yeah. Yeah, you want a talker or you want a doer? You want a guy who built stuff, you want a guy who talks about building stuff.You know, Sean, the greatest political scam in the last 50 years has been the media perpetrating the myth and falsehood that the Democrat Party is on the side of the minority community. This is ridiculous.Do you know how many people, by the way, through op-ed columns and elsewhere were whispering in the president's ear? Man, you know, leave Chicago alone. Leave it alone. Let them suffer the ramifications of their own bad decision-making with the leaders.You know how easy of a decision that could have been for him? And he didn't. And I was proud of him today, Sean. He came in there and said, no, not on my watch.And, you know, as I was preparing for the segment earlier, Sean, it's not a joke. I wanted to follow-up on a 3-year-old girl who was shot in the face in Chicago. So, I Googled it. It's on my phone.And it's right there. It turns out you have to go through which 3-year-old girl? Because there's not just one.Sean, if this was happening in Darfur, we'd have the embassy working 24 hours a day, 3-year-olds being shot in the face, I'm not kidding, Google 3- year-old shot in Chicago and you have to find the right one.HANNITY: Unbelievable.BONGINO: Thank God president Trump has the cojones to go in there and do the right thing and say not on my watch.HANNITY: Protecting federal buildings and 100 federal officers unless the governors and mayors do their job or at least request the help needed. The president -- he can't take responsibility for their failures.Last word --TERRELL: You know, one other comment, one other comment. The president wants to do more for America and people of color. Tim Scott, justice reform bill, guess what, two black Democrats, Booker and Harris stopped it. The Democrats are blocking justice in this country because they don't want Trump to succeed. It's crazy.HANNITY: Last word quick, Geraldo.RIVERA: But I don't understand, Sean, why there aren't more arrests in Portland. Those federal officers are taking abuse that is criminal. It is literally felonious assault.When you shine a laser in the eyes of a cop and his eyes are permanently damaged as a result, that's an assault, a felonious assault. These people should be arrested.And Mayor Wheeler and those other local hacks be damned. It's time for the feds to -- if a crime is committed in front of them, grab those people in charge them with arson. Charge them with whatever the crime is. They were being caught on tape. We're watching it every night.What is it now, almost 60 days? It's preposterous!HANNITY: Well, speaking of which, thank you all as always.Now, speaking of the war zone in Portland, Ami Horowitz was in the middle of that shift, the Adam Schiff show, horrible chaos, horrible violence. He was put in danger. We've got that exclusive video coming up next. A hundred and four days out of an election, Karl Rove, Senator John Kennedy, and a really big announcement.Stay with us.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)HANNITY: All right. The chaos continues in Portland.Last night, filmmaker, documentarian Ami Horowitz was in the city, captured these disturbing videos. Take a look.(VIDEO CLIP PLAYS)HANNITY: More on the collapse of another liberal city, law and order gone. Well, he's in Portland tonight, filmmaker Ami Horowitz.Describe what you saw last night especially as it relates to what they were doing to the police and to other areas?AMI HOROWITZ, FILMMAKER: Yeah, total chaos, Sean. Basically what is going on is you have in Portland at 9:00, you have a four square block radius around the federal court building in Portland that is taken over by protesters. Last night when I was there, going back tonight, there was about 5,000 people there who are protesting.But I've got to -- we've got to be clear what I mean by protesters. One of the -- the great stories about what is going on, not just in Portland but about the protest in general is the malpractice how these people are portrayed, how people view them in the media. They're saying it's all kumbaya, brother. They are just sitting there having a great time, and they're cooking out, and they've got people singing and dancing.And the reality is, you have hundreds of people attacked this federal building. I mean attacked. I mean, they had hammers, and steel pipes and were setting fires to burn the building down, and all the old people in it. While the, quote-unquote, peaceful protesters are exhorting them off, cheering them on, OK?These people are aghast to what was happening. These were not people who were saying, hey, guys, you shouldn't be doing this. They were supporting these people who are trying to burn these officers alive in the federal building.So, to say that they're -- it's emotionally peaceful protest, it's -- it's a load of crap. It's not true at all. They are part of the problem and a part of the violence.HANNITY: And you're going to go out again tonight. We'll have more video tomorrow, I assume. I hope I'm wrong. I hope there is no more video tomorrow, but I guess that's impossible.All right. Ami Horowitz, thank you.Today, comrade Bill de Blasio continued his denial New York City is experiencing extremely dangerous crime wave on his watch. He is threatening to sue President Trump. OK, if he sends in the feds. Philadelphia has been talked that they'll arrest troops. Meaning people there to protect the city and protect federal property. Wow, this is how sick it's gotten.Take a look.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MAYOR BILL DE BLASIO, D-N.Y.: I want to be very, very clear that we will not allow this to happen in our city. And this could only make things worse and I have sent this letter today to the attorney general and to the acting homeland secure -- homeland security secretary, making clear, formally, that the presence of these federal officials, these federal officers is not welcome here in New York City and is not needed here.We will not be intimidated. And if we see these federal officers on our streets, then we will see the Trump administration in court.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: Ooh, so scary.That guy right there, he is the dumbest mayor in the country. Even New York Governor Cuomo admitted Trump's concerns, the president's concerns about crime in our nation's capital and New York City, the largest city in the country, are well-founded. Take a look.(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)GOV. ANDREW CUOMO, D-N.Y.: Look, the president's concerns about New York City where well-founded. There are issues in New York City. You put COVID on top of the unrest after the George Floyd murder, et cetera, there's been an increase in crime. So I get the concerns, but I don't believe federal troops are the answer.(END AUDIO CLIP)HANNITY: He's not doing anything either. Philadelphia's top prosecutor saying that he's going to arrest any federal law enforcement agents sent to the city.Joining us now, author of the upcoming book \"Firebrand\", Congressman Matt Gaetz, former NYPD commissioner Bernie Kerik.Bernie, we know how to save cities. You did it, you and Rudy Giuliani. You went from about 2,500 murders a year, it got down as low as 300.BERNARD KERIK, FORMER NYPD COMMISSIONER: Sean, listen, Mayor -- Mayor Bill de Blasio is an idiot. And the reason I say he's an idiot is because we already have federal agents combined with the NYPD in every capacity. We have the FBI Joint Terrorist Task Force. We have the DEA task force. We have a number of bank robbery federal task force. They're already here.Here's the issue: the president has to up the numbers. That's what he has to do. There is already agreements in place between the NYPD and the federal government for these agents to be here. If he ups those numbers and we focus on gangs, guns and drugs, we can annihilate the rule of thugs.So, I know the mayor wants to talk about troops, we're not talking about troops. We're talking about special agents from the FBI, the DEA, ATF, and other federal agents that are already here. They already work here.I was in the DEA task force. He has no idea what he's talking about.HANNITY: You know, Matt Gaetz, you see this unfolding around the country. My attitude is very simple.Now, Bernie Kerik is right. We do have federal agents in big cities. OK, protecting federal courthouses and federal buildings. They have not only a right, an obligation to do so.But unless and until these liberal mayors, liberal governors are willing to do their job, and are rejecting the president's help, this is on them. That's their problem. All the president can do is offer to help.And I will tell you, the rejection is resulting in lost of life. This is not a game anymore.REP. MATT GAETZ, R-FLA.: America is a great nation and a great nation does not allow her cities to fall victim to the angry mob. The victims in these cases of violence, who see their businesses destroyed, their churches burned, sometimes even their lives lost and the lives lost of their children. They're not just Seattleites or Portlanders, or New Yorkers, they're Americans.And you're right. Secretary Chad Wolf said that if we didn't have federal troops there, the federal courthouses, the federal buildings would literally fall. And so, President Trump doesn't just have a legal obligation, he has a moral obligation to act.And our nation is stronger than this mob. I'm glad that President Trump is going to prove it. And these municipal leaders who have been feckless and cowardly, they will be exposed for what they are.HANNITY: By the way, Matt Gaetz can announce he's going to run for president in 2028. I just -- I've been hearing rumors all day about that. I'm teasing.You know, Bernie Kerik, the thing is that if they're going to turn federal agents into the enemy, and their attitude is get out of town, clean up the graffiti before you go, I don't think the president ought to take that step because at that point, now he is not only fighting the anarchist who will be encouraged by these reckless, irresponsible failed mayors and governors.KERIK: You know what, Sean? There was something really bothering me, this starts in Portland. You know, that mayor and the governor of Oregon, they're talking about all that stuff about, you shouldn't be there, the troop shouldn't be there, they shouldn't be, you know, harassing the protesters so to speak.I honestly think the FBI should be looking at these people. You cannot tell me that they're intentionally, they're not intentionally forcing the police not to go out and take out these protesters that are trying to burn down federal courthouses.HANNITY: Do you want to make your announcement tonight, Matt Gaetz?GAETZ: The only announcement I have is I've got a book \"Firebrand\" available for preorder on Amazon. And you know what? Joe Biden --HANNITY: I'm now endorsing it.GAETZ: -- he doesn't give a damn about these cities. If he did, he'd have done something about it when he was vice president.HANNITY: Yes. By the way, congratulations.One day, I want to tell a story about Matt, about what a great human being he is and how he's literally changed somebody's life for the better in a dramatic way. But I'm not going to do that story tonight.GAETZ: Thank you, Sean.HANNITY: All right. I mean it.All right. Quick break, Joe Biden, more blunders. I mean, it's a disaster. They're actually stopping interviews because he can't continue. We'll play you the tape. The architect Karl Rove joins us.Also, Senator John Kennedy here and our big announcement, all coming up. Thanks for being with us.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)HANNITY: So remember last week, barely there Joe Biden thought the state of Arizona's wonderful city. Another awkward moment today in his media blitz, including another interview cut short by one of his handlers because he can't handle it.Take a look.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOE BIDEN, D-PRESUMPTIVE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: I'm sorry. I'm confused too I am talking to here. But anyway, whoever it is.And I had nurse at the -- nurses at the Walter Reed Hospital who would been down and whisper in my ear to go home and get me pillows. They would make sure they'd actually probably never anything taught in -- you can't do it during the COVID time, but they would actually breathe in my nostrils to make me move.Wearing a mask now, this is a political statement? This is more patriotic. Why do you wear the mask? So you don't make somebody else sick. Sick.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I want to ask --BIDEN: What is with this guy?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Steve, that's our time.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: OK.All right. Thanks (ph) for your time.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: Time is up.If anyone can interpret that mess, go right ahead.Now, be honest, he was tired. It was time for his nappy.Anyway, beyond Biden's blunders, the constant -- the contrast between the president, his vision, his anima, strength, his mental alertness and his passion for American prosperity versus quid pro quo Joe's -- well, his vision, pleas to the enemy, Bernie Sanders, Bolshevik Bernie's economic plans, AOC, yeah, her New Green Deal plan, Beto Bozo O'Rourke's compensation of guns plan, and Pelosi and Schumer. Wow, a vote for Biden is a vote for Bernie and every extreme radical socialist agenda item ever proposed.Law, order, peace, prosperity, security, safety, it's all on the ballot in just 104 days where you become the ultimate jury.Joining us now to break it all down, FOX News contributor, we call him the architect, Karl Rove.All right, Karl, I need an interpreter. Can you interpret what that is? And they just fade to black now. Joe's losing it, sorry. We are out of time. Beep. You are out.KARL ROVE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Yes, mystifying. I was taken this week with his appearance on Joy Reid's new MSNBC program. He was her inaugural guest. She immediately gives him a chance, says, what do you think of President Trump's handling of the coronavirus? He begins to pummel him for a few moments.So, she then -- which she lets him go, that's what she wants him to do, and then she turns to him and says, well, look, you know, if you're elected, then the pandemics probably is still raging. So walk us through, she says, walk us what you would do differently next year.He then makes seven statements. Every one of the recommendations that he is going to do next year is already being done. He says, I've been talking about the Defense Production Act. Well, President Trump used that in March. He says, we need to have everybody wear masks. Well, the CDC and the White House Coronavirus Task Force recommended that months ago.He said, you know, we need to make sure the businesses continue to be able to stay alive. Well, that's called the CARES Act and it has over 800, nearly $900 billion in forgivable loans to small businesses.We need to make certain nobody, he says, who has COVID, gets -- has to pay for it. Well, the president already did that months ago.And he says, we need to have somebody in command right now in order to oversee the production and distribution of the vaccine. Well, that person is already in place. It is a general who is the head of the Army military command -- materials command and President Trump appointed him May 15th to do exactly that job. He says, and we need to spend $25 billion to do it.Well, Congress appropriated $10 million and the Department of Human and Health Services has found billions more and they're spending it. If they need more they're going to get more from Congress. But, I mean, here it is, he's given a great opportunity to tell us what you would do differently and all seven things that he lays out are things that the administration has exactly done.Can't the guy come up with one new idea, one -- just one, just one new idea? That'd be all we'd ask for.HANNITY: You know, he's also against the travel ban ten days after the first identified case. He's also against the subsequent travel ban, also against the quarantines. Countless, hundreds of thousands of Americans did not attract the virus because of it. It gave us time to kill the PPE that we needed and the ventilators.And Donald Trump did all that and he did it against the recommendations of many. Those three decisions right there he was against. And they saved lives.ROVE: Yes, we've seen Biden before. We've seen him a lot of places. We have had an emergency in our town and somebody says, you know, if I had been in charge, here is what I would have done. Or a big controversy, you know, if I had been the guy in charge, let me tell you, I would do it differently.And they can't do it. Just go look at and better yet read my column tomorrow morning where I lay it out what he says and what was already done. It's just amazing to me. Is this the best the guy can do? I mean, I think what is happening in the basement is he's gotten lazy, mentally lazy. And so, he thinks he can get away with this because he goes on places like Joy Reid and he doesn't get challenged.Let him get in front of a real journalist and see how he handles it. What if somebody said wait a minute, those things that have been done, I ask you, what differently you would do? You haven't suggested anything different. And let's see how he'd answer that. But he's getting away with murder right now, and it is getting to be a mistake for him because he can't keep this up for the 104 days up in the campaign.HANNITY: Would he get away, Karl, would he get away with trying to duck debates?ROVE: No, if he, if he or President Trump said, I'm not showing up at the debates, they will go down. There's no doubt about it. The American people expect him to show up for three debates.The president -- you know, the president has got to be careful because Biden did take care of Paul Ryan and took care of Sarah Palin and the vice presidential debate in '08 and '12. But he's got to show up for \u2018em, and that's going to be a real -- I think the climactic moment of this campaign. The debates are more important than they've ever been since at least 1980.HANNITY: All right. The architect, Karl Rove, thank you.When we come back, important information, tough action the president is taking on China. You won't believe what they did.And, by the way, John Kennedy reacts. That means he's going to have a lot of fun things to say and our big announcement, straight ahead.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)HANNITY: Breaking news today, the Chinese government threatened retaliation on Wednesday after the U.S. ordered the Chinese closed a consulate in Houston, Texas, over concerns it was being used for espionage. This after the DOJ announced that it has charged two Chinese hackers with trying to steal United States coronavirus research.Here with reaction, Louisiana Senator John Kennedy.You've been very outspoken on this. Look, the fact that after all of these years that we had people 30 and 40 years ago hacking into government agencies. If we don't fix this, it annoys the living daylights out of me. At what point is that our problem and our fault?SEN. JOHN KENNEDY, R-LA.: The Communist Party of China has become a world comorbidity, and America allowed it for well over 20 years. Too many of our leaders, Sean, got up every day and they just took the bullet train to chump town (ph). We didn't stand up to China.Now, we are. And we asked other countries to join with us.I don't want a cold war with China. China says -- the communist party in China says it wants respect. You have to earn respect. Respect is not a participation trophy.They have to show that they are willing to be posted stakeholders in a stable law and order. And vernacular, that means they have to agree to stop cheating.HANNITY: Innocent people died because of all of their lies. They now want to steal our information? The intellectual property theft has been a huge problem. Trade imbalance, a huge problem.We now must remove all the manufacturing, especially for vital items like agents of medicines and pharmaceuticals. How do -- what do you propose we do?KENNEDY: The first thing that I would do is ask other -- other members of the Western world to join with us. Australia is already there. The United Kingdom is already there.But I'm thinking specifically of our friends in Europe, the E.U. It's time that the E.U. grew some oranges and said, you know, we stand for something. And --HANNITY: They're weak, Senator. They're weak.KENNEDY: They are weak. And they could be much stronger.But they are so worried about making money from and with China, that in my judgment, they sacrificed their values. I don't mean to overstate it. There have been a few countries that have pushed back, but they need to push back as a group, as an organization, particularly Germany.HANNITY: Well, I agree with everything. People in your state in every state in this country died because of what they did, and around the world. Why wouldn't people unite on that? We have about 20 seconds.KENNEDY: It's not just the coronavirus. It's everything else too, as bad as the coronavirus is, Sean.HANNITY: Yes. All right, Senator, always appreciate you being with us. Thank you, sir.When we come back, our big announcement. That's next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)HANNITY: All right. A lot happening with the president: first, all of the new information on COVID-19. The state of the race, tomorrow, there will be 103 days until Election Day. Then, of course, safety, security, law and order.Nine Eastern, the president of the United States will be joining us for most of the hour right here on \"Hannity\". Set your DVR, you don't want to miss it.Also, in 13 days, my new book, first in 10 years, \"Live Free or Die: America and the World on the Brink\" will be available.

We have a big announcement coming tonight.And, by the way, we also want you to call all your Democratic friends right now, ask them to learn the real, ugly truth about Joe Biden. Joe Biden hit a new low today and also confusing moments again. We will expose the entire truth that the mob will never tell you.Joe, it's time we give America a history lesson about you. That's coming tonight.But first, we start with the carnage in Chicago, chaos in Portland, violent crime surging in nearly every major city in America. Democratic mayors, Democratic governors, they have failed in their most basic duty, and that is the most basic responsibility, to maintain law and order. They have failed and people are dying and being shot as a result.They have failed to keep their neighborhood safe. They have failed to prevent violent crime. As a result, men, women and children are dying. Our fellow Americans are dying.These mayors are literally twiddling their thumbs and playing politics. Philadelphia's top prosecutor is now vowing to arrest any federal law enforcement agents that are sent to the city.But President Trump is taking action. Today in a major press conference, he announced the expansion of what's called Operation LeGend. That's a federal program. It started in Kansas City and was named after a 4-year-old boy who was killed by gunfire while asleep in his own bed.Well, they'll now send more than 100 federal officers to Chicago, 35 to Albuquerque without having a problem in order to help take violent criminals off of the streets. The mayors aren't doing it. The governors aren't doing it.Listen to the president.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: The citizens of Chicago are citizens of America and they have the same right as every other American to live in safety, dignity and peace. No mother should ever have to cradle her dead child in her arms simply because politicians refused to do what is necessary to secure their neighborhood and to secure their city.Every American, no matter their income, race, or their zip code, should be able to walk the city streets free from violence and free from fear.For this reason today, I am announcing the Department of Justice will immediately surge federal law enforcement to the city of Chicago. The FBI, ATF, DEA, U.S. Marshals Service and Homeland Security will together be sending hundreds of skilled law enforcement officers to Chicago to help drive down violent crime.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: Safety, security is the foundation for our great American dream. Every child, every neighborhood, every city deserves to be safe. You can't climb the ladder of opportunity without security and safety.This president committed to making serious progress all over the country.Let's go back to his conference earlier today.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: My vision for America's cities could not be more different from the lawlessness being pushed by the extreme radical left. While others want to defund, defame, and abolish the police, I want to support and honor our great police.We want to build factories in Baltimore, not Beijing. We want to make our products in Chicago, not Shanghai. We want the American dream for American children, and I will fight to deliver that dream every ounce -- every single ounce of my strength, I will be fighting.But opportunity cannot thrive where there's violence, prosperity cannot flourish where there's bloodshed, and security cannot exist where there are violent criminals who are able to maim and murder with impunity. That is what Operation Legend is all about.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: \"Operation Legend\" is a beginning. It's greatly needed in all of these cities.Now, 100 agents, they cannot save and protect these cities. They can't. They can protect, well, federal property, they can help in investigations, they can get to underlying groups that are fomenting this violence.But unless and until these reckless, irresponsible Democratic mayors and governors do their job and/or allow the help they are being offered, they are allowing innocent people to die. That is all on them. New York, Chicago, Philly, Baltimore, you name the city, Seattle, Portland, it's all on them.Especially true in Chicago. Shootings were up 47 percent over last year, homicides up by a whopping 51 percent, 70 shot last weekend, 63 the weekend before, even children dying every single week. The violence reaches catastrophic levels.By the way, last night, we reported on that horrific mass shooting in the south side of Chicago. Fifteen people seriously wounded outside of a funeral home in what appears to be a gun-related incident. At least 60 shell casings recovered from the scene, caught on camera by nearby surveillance system.Take a look.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)(GUNSHOTS)(SCREAMING)(GUNSHOTS)(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: Mayor Lightweight isn't doing anything to protect her city.Moments later, two visibly shaken witnesses compared it to a war zone, as the president has been calling this and applauded the president's plan, please help us. Please send in.Well, the mayor and the governor won't let him do that. Take a look.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We wish it would stop. And we're glad the federal troops are here in Chicago because the violence is literally just as bad as it was as the Pandora, the Pandoran (INAUDIBLE). So, I mean, we need more cops and federal troops, because there's literally like we're in Iraq or something.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes, it feels like, we're -- at a war, in a war.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: As this devastating scene unfolding, sadly, typical night, Chicago's Mayor Lori Lightfoot who is a lightweight in terms of protecting people, busy on Twitter. What was she doing? Bashing President Trump, tweeting: Under no circumstances will I allow Donald Trump's troops to come to Chicago and terrorize our residents.She clearly hates the president more than she cares about innocent men, women and children in her city. Rahm \"Dead Fish\" Emanuel, he didn't do anything either. Barack Obama's president, barely mentioned Chicago, 1,000 shot, 1,000 died. Biden did nothing.At that point, when will these liberal mayors and governors, when do we hold them accountable for not protecting innocent people? Hundreds of people shot every week in Chicago and a lot of the cities. Six small children have been killed in July alone.Last night, a 3-year-old little girl was shot in the head, but the mayor is worried about troops terrorizing her city. Really? Now, what has she done to stop the violence? What has she done to save lives?Lightfoot who is a lightweight on protecting citizens seems more worried about optics and politics than the men, women and children that she is supposed to protect and serve. It's a national disgrace.She is not the only Democrat putting politics before human life. In Portland, we see the same thing. Democrats there, they're apoplectic. The federal agents were trying to protect federal buildings from being burned to the ground. That is their right and their job.Portland's mayor calling the federal officers, literally, the officers, not the anarchist, not the people involved in the violence, calling the officers un-American.Oregon's stupid governor floating an insane conspiracy theory that they were abducting people.Pelosi, get this, comparing agents, law enforcement agents who put their lives on the line to protect and serve \"stormtroopers\".Congressman Clyburn, the leadership in the Democratic Party, referring to them as Nazi Gestapo.Meanwhile, corrupt and confused Joe Biden, he's not said a single positive word about law enforcement, the 99th percent, since running for president. He accused federal agents of, quote, brutally attacking peaceful protesters.Now, we have also heard him say that police have become the enemy and he supports the defund effort or as he calls it, we will reallocate sources. He likes that word better.Let's be clear -- anarchist, vandals, have been writing nearly two straight months in downtown Portland. They firebombed the federal courthouse twice. They possibly, permanently blinded federal officers with lasers. Dozens of buildings have been vandalized, lit ablaze.Businesses, they're shutdown. People don't feel safe. These are not peaceful protests, Joe.And here's just a small example of what law enforcement is facing. Take a look.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)(CHANTING)(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: Wait until you see all of the video with Ami Horowitz who's on the ground in Portland as we speak. There have been more than 50 straight days of violent demonstrations in the city's downtown district.Remember, according to Biden, federal law enforcement officials were the real enemy here. See what's happening? Biden doesn't have a plan to stop violence, make America cities safer to protect innocent people so he just trashes Donald Trump.Now, he's even deploying one of the old Democratic Party favorite tactics. He is now playing the race card. I pointed out and I've done this history so many times come, every two years, every four years, like clockwork. Republicans, they are racist, sexists, misogynistic, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamophobic, they want dirty air and water. They want grandma and grandpa to eat dog food, cat food, before Paul Ryan or a Republican Trump look-alike throws granny over a cliff in a wheelchair.And, today, Biden accusing Trump, the president, of being the first racist president in history. Get ready for \"Hannity\" history real lesson in a second.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOE BIDEN, D-PRESUMPTIVE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: You have racists, they've existed and they tried to get elected president. He's the first one that has. And the way he pits people against one another is all designed to divide the country.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: Put y'all back in chains.All right. Now, it's time for a \"Hannity\" history lesson. Forget the fact that Democrats have accused every Republican of being racist. We've gone over -- 1998 radio ad in Missouri, the 2000 James Byrd ad, Al Gore, Republicans don't even want to count you in the census. They will put y'all back in chains.Let's go over the facts. Here's Joe Biden's history.It was Donald Trump, not Joe and not Barack who passed criminal justice reform and prison reform. It was Donald Trump, it wasn't Joe and it was not Barack who signed off on police reform. It was Donald Trump also doing opportunity zones, targeting mostly minority neighborhoods to help -- well, build the economies in neighborhoods that have been left behind by Joe and Barack.It was President Trump, not Joe, not Barack, who ushered in record low after record low after record low unemployment for African-Americans, Hispanic-Americans, Asian-Americans, women in the workplace, youth unemployment, African-American youth unemployment. Joe and Barack, they didn't do any of that.As a matter of fact, 13 million more Americans in food stamps, 8 million more in poverty, lowest labor participation rate in, oh, since the \u201870s. Had a 51-year low in homeownership rate, and the worst recovery since the '40s. That's their eight years of failure.And, by the way, three years in, President Trump has done more for minorities in this country than Joe Biden, Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer did in 125 years.Watch this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: You look at employment, you look at opportunity zones and maybe most importantly, you look at criminal justice reform. You look at prison reform. I've done things that nobody else -- and I've said this and I say it openly, and not a lot of people dispute it, I've done more for black Americans than anybody with the possible exception of Abraham Lincoln. Nobody has even been close.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: The media mob, the biggest contributor to the Biden campaign and all things radical, extreme Democratic socialist, they'll never tell you that.So, you need to ask yourself the question, what was Biden doing during his 50-plus year career in the swamp for African-Americans, other minorities?Here is where it gets interesting. All -- tell all your Democratic friends, we know he was very close and spoke so highly of the former Klansman Robert KKK Byrd, yes, former Klan leader. Biden called the Byrd the dean of the U.S. Senate, a close friend of mine and a mentor. That man filibustered the Civil Rights Act of 1964, that, well, Lyndon Johnson needed 80 percent of Republicans in the House and Senate to get past and most Democrats are opposing it.During a speech, Joe Biden in 1973 praised Democrats in a two-party system in the South that is called, well I'm a good for the -- I won't use the word.Around the same time, Biden was actively working with the segregationists. He didn't want immigration. He opposed school busing. According to NBC News, he led the charge on an initiative to keep black students away from the black students away from white students. That is his record.In \u201877, Biden worried his children, his children, if integration -- would grow up in a, quote, racial jungle if integration is not done in an orderly way, whatever the hell that means.1993, referred to inner-city youth as predators on our streets as he coauthored the most aggressive crime bill that ramped up prison sentences for dozens of crimes specifically targeting in the end minority Americans.In 2006, telling a crowd, well, you have to have a slight Indian accent to work out at 7-Eleven or Dunkin Donuts. I'm not kidding he said.2006, he bragged his state was a slave state.2007, yes, he actually said this about Barack Obama: the first, OK, the first mainstream African-American who is articulate, bright, clean, that story book, man. Wow.Last year, he said, poor kids could be just as bright as white kids. And recently, you ain't black if you don't support Donald Trump. Joe decides that?Joe Biden shouldn't throw stones from that glass house. That mob in the media will never tell you. Better yet, he could just stop saying racist things altogether. Joe, take a look in the mirror.When is anybody in the mob and the media going to ask him about any of these things? Because that's the truth, that's the history. And, by the way, actually knows if Joe Biden can even form a answer to any of these questions.We're going to play his very latest struggles in a moment. It's not good.Joining us now with reaction, FOX News contributor Dan Bongino, Fox News correspondent-at-large, Geraldo Rivera, civil rights attorney, Leo Terrell, Leo 2.0.All right, Leo, let's play a game here except it's not a game because lives matter, right? Let's not play games.LEO TERRELL, CIVIL RIGHTS LAWYER: Yes.HANNITY: Donald Trump set record low after record low unemployment, opportunity zones, the largest and most expensive of long-term commitment to historically black colleges in America -- Joe didn't do that. Criminal justice reform, Joe and Barack didn't do that. Police reform, Joe and Barack didn't do that.So, you tell me, if Donald Trump said the things I just laid out that Biden said, how would African-Americans and how would the media treat Donald Trump?TERRELL: They -- they would simply annihilate him. Let me be very clear to every Democrat on the planet, Donnell J. Trump has done more for black America in three years than the Biden/Obama administration.The reason why I'm here right now, the reason I'm voting for Donald Trump is because Joe Biden went on national radio and said, if you're -- if you vote for Trump, you ain't black. That is insulting. That is racist! Biden is the racist.And what is amazing is, you think you have another dinosaur, Jim Clyburn, who uses terms like Nazis, and Gestapo, he needs to retire. That is insulting to the people who suffer during the holocaust. So you have these old outdated Democrats who are still trying to pander to blacks. Blacks reject this. And with the crime going on in these Democratic cities, it is insulting.Donald Trump is the only person who can resurrect these Democratic cities and save them from lawlessness.But let's be very clear: Joe Biden is a racist, not Donald Trump.HANNITY: OK, Geraldo Rivera, I know how you feel about underprivileged in America, kids of all races. You got a heart of gold. One thing I will say about Geraldo, Dan Bongino knows it, Leo knows it, I know it, heart of gold.Donald Trump said those things, Geraldo, how different would it be in the media today?GERALDO RIVERA, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT-AT-LARGE: Oh, please, they would blow him up. It would be impossible for him to continue it. He's not a racist. I've known him 45 years.Having said that, I don't like that kung flu thing. I wish he would stop that. I think he has.I think there is some sloppy stuff, you know, in recent years that I don't like, but I know him. I know I've been in and out of that Trump Tower 50 times. It is as integrated as any building in this country. He gives opportunity on the basis of competence. Not skin color.And for Biden to say he is the first racist ever elected, that shows how disconnected Joe Biden is. 12 United States presidents were slaveholders. Joe should do a little research before he makes flamboyant charge like that, so unhinged from reality. Nixon, LBJ used language far more salty and you would argue, in today's standards, racist.This man is a good-hearted man and I really do believe that in terms of the economic opportunity zones and the criminal justice reform, he really has done more than any recent president for integration and the advancement of everybody regardless of their race, color, religion. You know that, Sean.HANNITY: And, Dan, this is what it comes down to too -- slogans, bumper stickers, symbolism. I'll take the substance. I'll take the jobs. I'll take the opportunity zones. I will take the money for historically black colleges.I'll take the results over the rhetoric. Every two years, every four years, Dan Bongino, Republicans are racist, sexist, my whole list.BONGINO: Yeah. Yeah, you want a talker or you want a doer? You want a guy who built stuff, you want a guy who talks about building stuff.You know, Sean, the greatest political scam in the last 50 years has been the media perpetrating the myth and falsehood that the Democrat Party is on the side of the minority community. This is ridiculous.Do you know how many people, by the way, through op-ed columns and elsewhere were whispering in the president's ear? Man, you know, leave Chicago alone. Leave it alone. Let them suffer the ramifications of their own bad decision-making with the leaders.You know how easy of a decision that could have been for him? And he didn't. And I was proud of him today, Sean. He came in there and said, no, not on my watch.And, you know, as I was preparing for the segment earlier, Sean, it's not a joke. I wanted to follow-up on a 3-year-old girl who was shot in the face in Chicago. So, I Googled it. It's on my phone.And it's right there. It turns out you have to go through which 3-year-old girl? Because there's not just one.Sean, if this was happening in Darfur, we'd have the embassy working 24 hours a day, 3-year-olds being shot in the face, I'm not kidding, Google 3- year-old shot in Chicago and you have to find the right one.HANNITY: Unbelievable.BONGINO: Thank God president Trump has the cojones to go in there and do the right thing and say not on my watch.HANNITY: Protecting federal buildings and 100 federal officers unless the governors and mayors do their job or at least request the help needed. The president -- he can't take responsibility for their failures.Last word --TERRELL: You know, one other comment, one other comment. The president wants to do more for America and people of color. Tim Scott, justice reform bill, guess what, two black Democrats, Booker and Harris stopped it. The Democrats are blocking justice in this country because they don't want Trump to succeed. It's crazy.HANNITY: Last word quick, Geraldo.RIVERA: But I don't understand, Sean, why there aren't more arrests in Portland. Those federal officers are taking abuse that is criminal. It is literally felonious assault.When you shine a laser in the eyes of a cop and his eyes are permanently damaged as a result, that's an assault, a felonious assault. These people should be arrested.And Mayor Wheeler and those other local hacks be damned. It's time for the feds to -- if a crime is committed in front of them, grab those people in charge them with arson. Charge them with whatever the crime is. They were being caught on tape. We're watching it every night.What is it now, almost 60 days? It's preposterous!HANNITY: Well, speaking of which, thank you all as always.Now, speaking of the war zone in Portland, Ami Horowitz was in the middle of that shift, the Adam Schiff show, horrible chaos, horrible violence. He was put in danger. We've got that exclusive video coming up next. A hundred and four days out of an election, Karl Rove, Senator John Kennedy, and a really big announcement.Stay with us.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)HANNITY: All right. The chaos continues in Portland.Last night, filmmaker, documentarian Ami Horowitz was in the city, captured these disturbing videos. Take a look.(VIDEO CLIP PLAYS)HANNITY: More on the collapse of another liberal city, law and order gone. Well, he's in Portland tonight, filmmaker Ami Horowitz.Describe what you saw last night especially as it relates to what they were doing to the police and to other areas?AMI HOROWITZ, FILMMAKER: Yeah, total chaos, Sean. Basically what is going on is you have in Portland at 9:00, you have a four square block radius around the federal court building in Portland that is taken over by protesters. Last night when I was there, going back tonight, there was about 5,000 people there who are protesting.But I've got to -- we've got to be clear what I mean by protesters. One of the -- the great stories about what is going on, not just in Portland but about the protest in general is the malpractice how these people are portrayed, how people view them in the media. They're saying it's all kumbaya, brother. They are just sitting there having a great time, and they're cooking out, and they've got people singing and dancing.And the reality is, you have hundreds of people attacked this federal building. I mean attacked. I mean, they had hammers, and steel pipes and were setting fires to burn the building down, and all the old people in it. While the, quote-unquote, peaceful protesters are exhorting them off, cheering them on, OK?These people are aghast to what was happening. These were not people who were saying, hey, guys, you shouldn't be doing this. They were supporting these people who are trying to burn these officers alive in the federal building.So, to say that they're -- it's emotionally peaceful protest, it's -- it's a load of crap. It's not true at all. They are part of the problem and a part of the violence.HANNITY: And you're going to go out again tonight. We'll have more video tomorrow, I assume. I hope I'm wrong. I hope there is no more video tomorrow, but I guess that's impossible.All right. Ami Horowitz, thank you.Today, comrade Bill de Blasio continued his denial New York City is experiencing extremely dangerous crime wave on his watch. He is threatening to sue President Trump. OK, if he sends in the feds. Philadelphia has been talked that they'll arrest troops. Meaning people there to protect the city and protect federal property. Wow, this is how sick it's gotten.Take a look.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MAYOR BILL DE BLASIO, D-N.Y.: I want to be very, very clear that we will not allow this to happen in our city. And this could only make things worse and I have sent this letter today to the attorney general and to the acting homeland secure -- homeland security secretary, making clear, formally, that the presence of these federal officials, these federal officers is not welcome here in New York City and is not needed here.We will not be intimidated. And if we see these federal officers on our streets, then we will see the Trump administration in court.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: Ooh, so scary.That guy right there, he is the dumbest mayor in the country. Even New York Governor Cuomo admitted Trump's concerns, the president's concerns about crime in our nation's capital and New York City, the largest city in the country, are well-founded. Take a look.(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)GOV. ANDREW CUOMO, D-N.Y.: Look, the president's concerns about New York City where well-founded. There are issues in New York City. You put COVID on top of the unrest after the George Floyd murder, et cetera, there's been an increase in crime. So I get the concerns, but I don't believe federal troops are the answer.(END AUDIO CLIP)HANNITY: He's not doing anything either. Philadelphia's top prosecutor saying that he's going to arrest any federal law enforcement agents sent to the city.Joining us now, author of the upcoming book \"Firebrand\", Congressman Matt Gaetz, former NYPD commissioner Bernie Kerik.Bernie, we know how to save cities. You did it, you and Rudy Giuliani. You went from about 2,500 murders a year, it got down as low as 300.BERNARD KERIK, FORMER NYPD COMMISSIONER: Sean, listen, Mayor -- Mayor Bill de Blasio is an idiot. And the reason I say he's an idiot is because we already have federal agents combined with the NYPD in every capacity. We have the FBI Joint Terrorist Task Force. We have the DEA task force. We have a number of bank robbery federal task force. They're already here.Here's the issue: the president has to up the numbers. That's what he has to do. There is already agreements in place between the NYPD and the federal government for these agents to be here. If he ups those numbers and we focus on gangs, guns and drugs, we can annihilate the rule of thugs.So, I know the mayor wants to talk about troops, we're not talking about troops. We're talking about special agents from the FBI, the DEA, ATF, and other federal agents that are already here. They already work here.I was in the DEA task force. He has no idea what he's talking about.HANNITY: You know, Matt Gaetz, you see this unfolding around the country. My attitude is very simple.Now, Bernie Kerik is right. We do have federal agents in big cities. OK, protecting federal courthouses and federal buildings. They have not only a right, an obligation to do so.But unless and until these liberal mayors, liberal governors are willing to do their job, and are rejecting the president's help, this is on them. That's their problem. All the president can do is offer to help.And I will tell you, the rejection is resulting in lost of life. This is not a game anymore.REP. MATT GAETZ, R-FLA.: America is a great nation and a great nation does not allow her cities to fall victim to the angry mob. The victims in these cases of violence, who see their businesses destroyed, their churches burned, sometimes even their lives lost and the lives lost of their children. They're not just Seattleites or Portlanders, or New Yorkers, they're Americans.And you're right. Secretary Chad Wolf said that if we didn't have federal troops there, the federal courthouses, the federal buildings would literally fall. And so, President Trump doesn't just have a legal obligation, he has a moral obligation to act.And our nation is stronger than this mob. I'm glad that President Trump is going to prove it. And these municipal leaders who have been feckless and cowardly, they will be exposed for what they are.HANNITY: By the way, Matt Gaetz can announce he's going to run for president in 2028. I just -- I've been hearing rumors all day about that. I'm teasing.You know, Bernie Kerik, the thing is that if they're going to turn federal agents into the enemy, and their attitude is get out of town, clean up the graffiti before you go, I don't think the president ought to take that step because at that point, now he is not only fighting the anarchist who will be encouraged by these reckless, irresponsible failed mayors and governors.KERIK: You know what, Sean? There was something really bothering me, this starts in Portland. You know, that mayor and the governor of Oregon, they're talking about all that stuff about, you shouldn't be there, the troop shouldn't be there, they shouldn't be, you know, harassing the protesters so to speak.I honestly think the FBI should be looking at these people. You cannot tell me that they're intentionally, they're not intentionally forcing the police not to go out and take out these protesters that are trying to burn down federal courthouses.HANNITY: Do you want to make your announcement tonight, Matt Gaetz?GAETZ: The only announcement I have is I've got a book \"Firebrand\" available for preorder on Amazon. And you know what? Joe Biden --HANNITY: I'm now endorsing it.GAETZ: -- he doesn't give a damn about these cities. If he did, he'd have done something about it when he was vice president.HANNITY: Yes. By the way, congratulations.One day, I want to tell a story about Matt, about what a great human being he is and how he's literally changed somebody's life for the better in a dramatic way. But I'm not going to do that story tonight.GAETZ: Thank you, Sean.HANNITY: All right. I mean it.All right. Quick break, Joe Biden, more blunders. I mean, it's a disaster. They're actually stopping interviews because he can't continue. We'll play you the tape. The architect Karl Rove joins us.Also, Senator John Kennedy here and our big announcement, all coming up. Thanks for being with us.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)HANNITY: So remember last week, barely there Joe Biden thought the state of Arizona's wonderful city. Another awkward moment today in his media blitz, including another interview cut short by one of his handlers because he can't handle it.Take a look.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOE BIDEN, D-PRESUMPTIVE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: I'm sorry. I'm confused too I am talking to here. But anyway, whoever it is.And I had nurse at the -- nurses at the Walter Reed Hospital who would been down and whisper in my ear to go home and get me pillows. They would make sure they'd actually probably never anything taught in -- you can't do it during the COVID time, but they would actually breathe in my nostrils to make me move.Wearing a mask now, this is a political statement? This is more patriotic. Why do you wear the mask? So you don't make somebody else sick. Sick.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I want to ask --BIDEN: What is with this guy?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Steve, that's our time.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: OK.All right. Thanks (ph) for your time.(END VIDEO CLIP)HANNITY: Time is up.If anyone can interpret that mess, go right ahead.Now, be honest, he was tired. It was time for his nappy.Anyway, beyond Biden's blunders, the constant -- the contrast between the president, his vision, his anima, strength, his mental alertness and his passion for American prosperity versus quid pro quo Joe's -- well, his vision, pleas to the enemy, Bernie Sanders, Bolshevik Bernie's economic plans, AOC, yeah, her New Green Deal plan, Beto Bozo O'Rourke's compensation of guns plan, and Pelosi and Schumer. Wow, a vote for Biden is a vote for Bernie and every extreme radical socialist agenda item ever proposed.Law, order, peace, prosperity, security, safety, it's all on the ballot in just 104 days where you become the ultimate jury.Joining us now to break it all down, FOX News contributor, we call him the architect, Karl Rove.All right, Karl, I need an interpreter. Can you interpret what that is? And they just fade to black now. Joe's losing it, sorry. We are out of time. Beep. You are out.KARL ROVE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Yes, mystifying. I was taken this week with his appearance on Joy Reid's new MSNBC program. He was her inaugural guest. She immediately gives him a chance, says, what do you think of President Trump's handling of the coronavirus? He begins to pummel him for a few moments.So, she then -- which she lets him go, that's what she wants him to do, and then she turns to him and says, well, look, you know, if you're elected, then the pandemics probably is still raging. So walk us through, she says, walk us what you would do differently next year.He then makes seven statements. Every one of the recommendations that he is going to do next year is already being done. He says, I've been talking about the Defense Production Act. Well, President Trump used that in March. He says, we need to have everybody wear masks. Well, the CDC and the White House Coronavirus Task Force recommended that months ago.He said, you know, we need to make sure the businesses continue to be able to stay alive. Well, that's called the CARES Act and it has over 800, nearly $900 billion in forgivable loans to small businesses.We need to make certain nobody, he says, who has COVID, gets -- has to pay for it. Well, the president already did that months ago.And he says, we need to have somebody in command right now in order to oversee the production and distribution of the vaccine. Well, that person is already in place. It is a general who is the head of the Army military command -- materials command and President Trump appointed him May 15th to do exactly that job. He says, and we need to spend $25 billion to do it.Well, Congress appropriated $10 million and the Department of Human and Health Services has found billions more and they're spending it. If they need more they're going to get more from Congress. But, I mean, here it is, he's given a great opportunity to tell us what you would do differently and all seven things that he lays out are things that the administration has exactly done.Can't the guy come up with one new idea, one -- just one, just one new idea? That'd be all we'd ask for.HANNITY: You know, he's also against the travel ban ten days after the first identified case. He's also against the subsequent travel ban, also against the quarantines. Countless, hundreds of thousands of Americans did not attract the virus because of it. It gave us time to kill the PPE that we needed and the ventilators.And Donald Trump did all that and he did it against the recommendations of many. Those three decisions right there he was against. And they saved lives.ROVE: Yes, we've seen Biden before. We've seen him a lot of places. We have had an emergency in our town and somebody says, you know, if I had been in charge, here is what I would have done. Or a big controversy, you know, if I had been the guy in charge, let me tell you, I would do it differently.And they can't do it. Just go look at and better yet read my column tomorrow morning where I lay it out what he says and what was already done. It's just amazing to me. Is this the best the guy can do? I mean, I think what is happening in the basement is he's gotten lazy, mentally lazy. And so, he thinks he can get away with this because he goes on places like Joy Reid and he doesn't get challenged.Let him get in front of a real journalist and see how he handles it. What if somebody said wait a minute, those things that have been done, I ask you, what differently you would do? You haven't suggested anything different. And let's see how he'd answer that. But he's getting away with murder right now, and it is getting to be a mistake for him because he can't keep this up for the 104 days up in the campaign.HANNITY: Would he get away, Karl, would he get away with trying to duck debates?ROVE: No, if he, if he or President Trump said, I'm not showing up at the debates, they will go down. There's no doubt about it. The American people expect him to show up for three debates.The president -- you know, the president has got to be careful because Biden did take care of Paul Ryan and took care of Sarah Palin and the vice presidential debate in '08 and '12. But he's got to show up for \u2018em, and that's going to be a real -- I think the climactic moment of this campaign. The debates are more important than they've ever been since at least 1980.HANNITY: All right. The architect, Karl Rove, thank you.When we come back, important information, tough action the president is taking on China. You won't believe what they did.And, by the way, John Kennedy reacts. That means he's going to have a lot of fun things to say and our big announcement, straight ahead.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)HANNITY: Breaking news today, the Chinese government threatened retaliation on Wednesday after the U.S. ordered the Chinese closed a consulate in Houston, Texas, over concerns it was being used for espionage. This after the DOJ announced that it has charged two Chinese hackers with trying to steal United States coronavirus research.Here with reaction, Louisiana Senator John Kennedy.You've been very outspoken on this. Look, the fact that after all of these years that we had people 30 and 40 years ago hacking into government agencies. If we don't fix this, it annoys the living daylights out of me. At what point is that our problem and our fault?SEN. JOHN KENNEDY, R-LA.: The Communist Party of China has become a world comorbidity, and America allowed it for well over 20 years. Too many of our leaders, Sean, got up every day and they just took the bullet train to chump town (ph). We didn't stand up to China.Now, we are. And we asked other countries to join with us.I don't want a cold war with China. China says -- the communist party in China says it wants respect. You have to earn respect. Respect is not a participation trophy.They have to show that they are willing to be posted stakeholders in a stable law and order. And vernacular, that means they have to agree to stop cheating.HANNITY: Innocent people died because of all of their lies. They now want to steal our information? The intellectual property theft has been a huge problem. Trade imbalance, a huge problem.We now must remove all the manufacturing, especially for vital items like agents of medicines and pharmaceuticals. How do -- what do you propose we do?KENNEDY: The first thing that I would do is ask other -- other members of the Western world to join with us. Australia is already there. The United Kingdom is already there.But I'm thinking specifically of our friends in Europe, the E.U. It's time that the E.U. grew some oranges and said, you know, we stand for something. And --HANNITY: They're weak, Senator. They're weak.KENNEDY: They are weak. And they could be much stronger.But they are so worried about making money from and with China, that in my judgment, they sacrificed their values. I don't mean to overstate it. There have been a few countries that have pushed back, but they need to push back as a group, as an organization, particularly Germany.HANNITY: Well, I agree with everything. People in your state in every state in this country died because of what they did, and around the world. Why wouldn't people unite on that? We have about 20 seconds.KENNEDY: It's not just the coronavirus. It's everything else too, as bad as the coronavirus is, Sean.HANNITY: Yes. All right, Senator, always appreciate you being with us. Thank you, sir.When we come back, our big announcement. That's next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)HANNITY: All right. A lot happening with the president: first, all of the new information on COVID-19. The state of the race, tomorrow, there will be 103 days until Election Day. Then, of course, safety, security, law and order.Nine Eastern, the president of the United States will be joining us for most of the hour right here on \"Hannity\".

JIM JORDAN (R-OH): Congress has broad oversight authority. I understand that. But it's supposed to be used for legitimate legislative purposes. This has been politically driven from day one. REP. MARY GAY SCANLON (D-PA): The Supreme Court agreed that the president doesn't have the right to hide his financial records. (END VIDEO CLIP) NEIL CAVUTO, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: A very taxing day for the president of the United States. The Supreme Court, in a 7-2 decision, says that a grand jury can go ahead and subpoena for his taxes. What was glaring about that 7-2 decision it included Justice Gorsuch and Justice Kavanaugh, who voted against the president on this. Growing questions what happens right now. What we do know now is, this shook the world and our markets. More on that in a second, an historic day that could have an influence on the election. Let's get the read right now from Shannon Bream on the legal implications of all of this -- Shannon. SHANNON BREAM, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Hey, Neil. Great to see you. So, yes, two big decisions grabbing headlines. They are blockbusters, but they don't actually resolve these cases just yet when it comes to those documents. Let's talk through the two of them. So the first involve three House committees who say they need to get their hands on the president's financial records, even dating back to the time before he was running for the White House. So this is what the court said today. Listen, committees can get them, but they haven't done a good enough job just yet, the courts and the committee's. This is what the chief justice said, writing for the majority. He says: \"Congressional subpoenas for information from the president implicate special concerns regarding the separate have powers. The courts below did not take adequate account of those concerns.\" So he gave him sort of a four-pronged test, said, there are other things you have to look into, and realize these are two competing branches. You got to wade into this carefully. It wasn't done well enough yet. So those cases go back down. Now, Justice Thomas doesn't even think that needs to happen. Here's what he said in his dissent in that case involving the House committees: \"The power to subpoena private, non-official documents is not a necessary implication of Congress' legislative powers. If Congress wishes to obtain these documents, it should proceed through the impeachment power.\" And there are lawmakers hinting, if the president's reelected, they may take another swing at that. Now, the other case you mentioned involves a New York prosecutor up in New York state, and a subpoena connected to a criminal investigation, a grand jury there. The court said, yes, no president is immune from that kind of document, from that kind of subpoena. You don't get absolute immunity. But there are enough questions here that this is going to go back to the lower courts for more consideration, the chief justice writing this: \"The arguments presented here and in the court of appeals were limited to absolute immunity and heightened need. The court of appeals, however, has directed that the case be returned to the district court, where the president may raise further arguments as appropriate.\" So, Neil, where that leaves us tonight is, the president's legal team says, we're going to keep fighting on both these fronts as they go back to the lower courts. So almost nobody expects that those documents will be released before Election Day, just months away -- Neil. CAVUTO: But someone could leak them, right? BREAM: Yes. And you know what? That's a concern that actually came up during the arguments, especially the case dealing with the New York prosecutor. Justice Alito was pushing back with the one of the attorneys arguing the case, and he said, listen, we all know that prosecutors have leaked things. And he specifically mentioned, things sometimes get leaked to The New York Times. So he was very aware that that was a potential consideration in the case. Any time you give documents to congressional committees, to anyone, that you expand the circle of who has access, you got to know there's a potential for leaks in it. And it's been a real problem for this administration -- Neil. CAVUTO: Yes, by the president himself, with his own niece releasing a lot of financial information to The New York Times. BREAM: Right. CAVUTO: All right, thank you very much, Shannon Bream. Kristin Fisher on this at a not-so-happy White House -- Kristin. KRISTIN FISHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Yes, well, President Trump came out pretty hot right after this ruling came down, seven tweets in about two hours. But when he talked about it in front of the cameras for the first time since the Supreme Court ruled on this, he gave a much more measured response. Listen to this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: Well, the rulings were basically starting all over again, sending everything back down to the lower courts, and you start all over again. And so, from a certain point, I'm satisfied. From another point, we're not satisfied. (END VIDEO CLIP) FISHER: So let's break down that statement a little bit. President Trump is saying that he's satisfied that his financial records will remain private, at least for now. But he's not satisfied that the Supreme Court ruled that presidents do not have absolute immunity from criminal subpoenas. And we now know the president's attorney Jay Sekulow, as Shannon was saying, says that the fight will continue. And they're going to continue to raise these additional constitutional and legal issues in the lower courts. So, bottom line, after years of President Trump fighting to keep his financial records private, today, we simply learned that the fight is going to continue. But House Speaker Nancy Pelosi says that today's ruling was about much, much more than simply the president's tax returns and financial records. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PELOSI: What was at stake, is the president above the law? If, in fact, they would have ruled that he is above -- not above the law -- I mean, that he can do whatever he wants, without any oversight from Congress, that would have been just devastating, to tell you the honest truth. (END VIDEO CLIP) FISHER: Now, the other really notable thing about today, Neil -- and you mentioned this in your introduction -- was the fact that the president's two nominees to the Supreme Court, Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, they both ruled against President Trump today. So, during the briefing with the White House press secretary, I asked her about that. I asked if President Trump was upset at Justices Gorsuch and Kavanaugh, but all she would say is that, when she spoke with the president, he did not talk about it. And she also noted that the president overall believes that these justices are entitled to their own opinions, Neil, but certainly striking that the president's two nominees to the high court did not go his way today. CAVUTO: Yes, it's not the first time that's happened either. Kristin Fisher, thank you very, very much. Now, this compels, whatever the president might think of this, his financial accounting firms to turn over these documents to the grand jury investigating this case in the Southern District of New York. And therein lies this mystery period over who has what and when and over what time that could possibly be addressed. Let's go to Sam Dewey on this, the former congressional investigator, also an attorney. Sam, how quickly must these firms comply to get this over to this grand jury and to the Southern District? How does it work? SAMUEL DEWEY, ATTORNEY: Well, I think first, it's going to have to go back down to the lower courts. And there's going to be additional litigation, under the parameters of the court's opinion. The opinion of the court in the tax return cases said, the president doesn't have absolute immunity, but he can raise these objections. And these objections are going to be raised, perhaps in federal court, perhaps in state court. And the unfortunate answer is, we know there's going to be a lot more litigation, but we don't know exactly how it's going to work, because the court's opinion is so vague on the applicable tests. CAVUTO: So, Sam, when the highest court is saying, all right, these have to be handed over, there isn't an essence of time issue here? In other words, does that take some time before they physically get them to sort all this other stuff out? Or do they get it very, very quickly? The only reason why I raise it is the fear of leaks. DEWEY: Yes. Well, I think leaks are a good question. And I think that the question of leaks, I think Justice Alito made a very powerful point in his dissent about that. The records aren't going to be turned over yet until the lower court works out exactly which particular records are going to be turned over, because what the Supreme Court said is, you don't have absolute immunity, Mr. President, but you have some objections you can raise. Go back to the lower courts and work that out. And that's the process that's going to occur. So, documents won't be turned over yet. CAVUTO: OK. So, for Congress and a lot of Democrats there who want to get their hot little hands on this, and maybe pursue impeachment hearings and all the rest, if they get what they want, or they think they're getting what they want, obviously, the office in New York is looking at what might be offenses that the president committed in either payments or the way his businesses were transacted. And then Congress, if it were to go forward and get this eventually, would seize on the same information, right? DEWEY: Yes. And the subpoenas were actually almost identical, which I think raises a very strong question about, was this more about a coordinated political attack on the president than an actual investigation? But I think that's absolutely right. CAVUTO: OK. Yes, wild stuff. Sam, thank you so much, Sam Dewey, following this very, very closely. I want to bring your attention again to the Corner of Wall and Broad. This rattled the markets when they first got the news. I think it was around 10:10 a.m. I could be off a little bit. We were already down, I believe, about 90 to 100 points. We quickly quintupled that, finished the day down 361 points. I always like to stress that Wall Street really isn't red or blue. You have heard that a million times. It's green. It's made a lot money under this president. Anything that looks bad for him looks bad for them, or the fear is that this could really dent the president's chances to get reelected. Now, I'm not saying that's on a personal political basis. They just like the good times that have been roaring in these markets and the comeback in the economy. And this was deemed to be, at the very least, initially disruptive to that. Kristina Partsinevelos following that side of the equation -- Kristina. KRISTINA PARTSINEVELOS, FOX NEWS BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Right. Neil, I'm just going to follow up on that. You had stocks that did abruptly turn negative. You had the S&P 500, as well as the Dow erasing all weekly gains. But the Nasdaq came out in positive territory, hitting a record high, thanks primarily to the tech sector. But let's go back to what you were talking about, the Supreme Court ruling around 10:00 a.m. You did see stocks fall at that point, when there was a ruling 7-2 that prosecutors could follow ahead and seek out the president's financial documents, as well as tax returns. Markets tend to be very friendly towards the president and his policies. So, when you see these relatively new negative headlines, they're sometimes knee-jerk reactions. There's other catalysts for the volatility today, though, too. You also had new data that coronavirus cases were surging in certain parts of the country, in particular, Florida, as well as California. And that, of course, weighs negatively on investor sentiment, because they want a smooth reopening. Even Dr. Fauci weighed in, saying some states should consider looking at shutting down. But we also have a new report from the Labor Department showing that jobless claims fell for the week ending July 4. That means another 1.3 million Americans filed for first-time unemployment benefits. That's actually a decelerating trend since March. And two particular stocks we could just focus on really quickly, you have got Walgreens in the red today, down over 7 percent. And that's a net loss. They're going to be closing jobs. And then Bed Bath & Beyond down a whopping 24 percent, primarily because they're closing 200 stores, and 50 percent of their sales fell because of the pandemic. So, lots of volatility continues in these markets -- Neil, back to you. CAVUTO: All right, Kristina, thank you very, very much. Want to go to Teddy Weisberg right now, Seaport Securities. He's been through a lot of political and other scandals, not himself personally, I might point out... (LAUGHTER) CAVUTO: ... but certainly what's been going on here. Teddy, markets abhor uncertainty. I get that. We have talked about that over the many years I have had the pleasure to know you. I'm wondering here, isn't it still the economy, stupid, or maybe, by extension, the president's handling of the virus, if that stabilizes and rights itself? Or does this add a variable we can't calculate? TED WEISBERG, PRESIDENT, SEAPORT SECURITIES CORPORATION: Well, I'm not sure that it -- it certainly adds a variable, Neil, and an unknown. And we know that markets are not comfortable with unknowns. But this president and this administration has dealt with a lot of political variables that have been going on for three-and-a-half years. And for the most part, these events seem to have a relatively short shelf life as far as the market is concerned. And, yes, I would agree with you. I mean, this is clearly something else that, I guess, for the markets to be nervous about. But I think the shelf life here will be relatively limited, because it'll go back to the courts. Who knows when it will reappear again. And, basically, it's going to be all about the economy, stupid, right, and COVID-19. And now second-quarter earnings are about to start any day, and then third-quarter earnings. We have plenty of other things that I think are much more important at the moment for the market to deal with than today's Supreme Court rulings. CAVUTO: You know, when you think about the Supreme Court and the role it's played in market history and our own history, when the Supreme Court, all nine justices, voted against Richard Nixon and said that he had to release the tapes, I grant you, Teddy, apples and oranges, but that just continued a cascading market. That was a very different time, I grant you. But when these things happen, there seem to be seminal moments, when, even in the case of a couple of justices appointed by the president, did not go the president way, does that have any potential rattle effect? WEISBERG: Well, I -- yes, I mean, the answer is, it does. And we saw it today. But down 300-and-some-odd points in a market that's had such a dramatic rise from the trading low of March... CAVUTO: Absolutely WEISBERG: I mean, we just finished one of the best quarters in, what, 20 or 25 years. In general, in general, markets are due to rest. I mean, is it today's rulings that perhaps will put a little blanket on the market? I don't know. There are plenty of other things for the markets to deal with, Neil. I just don't think that, in terms of the market, this is going to have a dramatic shelf life. CAVUTO: Real quickly, Teddy. The president has said that, if Joe Biden gets his way, with the higher taxes that will come, or at least bring the corporate rate up, you can kiss your market rally goodbye and your 401(k) will melt away. What do you think of that? (LAUGHTER) WEISBERG: Well, we know that the president has been a great cheerleader for the stock market. And, clearly, he's had a lot to cheer about for the last three-and-a-half years. Whether he's directly responsible or not, only the history books will tell us. But that there is no question that one of the issues with a change in administration, in the case of Joe Biden, is -- and he's -- I think he implied and again said it today, that he thinks corporate America should pay more than their fair share. So that translates into higher corporate taxes. Clearly, that cannot be a positive for the market. So, yes, I mean, if -- I'm not sure it's as severe as the president is suggesting, but there's no question that, if he doesn't win, and Biden takes over, corporate taxes are probably going up, as are probably individual taxes. And at least initially, I don't know how that's a plus for the stock market. CAVUTO: Ted, thank you very, very much, my friend. Be well, be safe, be healthy. WEISBERG: You too. Thank you, Neil. CAVUTO: Teddy Weisberg. All right, we are going to continue following this. You heard about the market impact. That could be just a one-shot event. The campaign fallout, well, that could be something entirely different. Stick around. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. ERIC SWALWELL (D-CA): I think the law is so clear that no one's above it, and that the president too has to follow. REP. DEVIN NUNES (R-CA): It would just be more nonsense, like they constantly do, where we have to deal with, they throw out a narrative bomb. It runs across all the platforms, and then Republicans are always having to respond to it. (END VIDEO CLIP) (COMMERCIAL BREAK) \u00a0CAVUTO: The Biden campaign responding to the Supreme Court news regarding the president today, while offering the former vice president opportunity to president an economic plan he says we will turn things around right now. Peter Doocy with more on that from Pennsylvania -- Peter. PETER DOOCY, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Neil, the former V.P.'s event today was just a five-minute drive from the house where he grew up, which is now -- of course, perfect timing by a soda truck -- that house right there. But he talks a lot at his events about coming up as a young senator. And one of the ways that he connects with people is talking about how financial disclosures used to show that he had the fewest assets of anybody in the United States Senate in the Upper Chamber. So, today, shortly after the president's Supreme Court's tax return ruling regarding President Trump, he re-upped a tweet from last year, Biden did. He wrote this: \"Donald Trump, you want to talk about corruption. I have released 21 years of my tax returns. Release yours or shut up.\" And then Biden added this comment today. He said: \"As I was saying.\" And these Trump tax returns used to be something that Biden talked about a lot on the campaign trail, especially in Iowa and New Hampshire. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOSEPH BIDEN (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: What's he hiding? What's he afraid of? What's buried in those returns? Why can't the American people see them? (END VIDEO CLIP) DOOCY: That clip was from October. In this afternoon's remarks here in Pennsylvania, Biden did not directly address in front of the crowd the Supreme Court ruling about the tax returns, as the tax returns took a backseat to issues like health care and investing in American-made goods and services, to the tune of 700 billion tax dollars shortly after he takes over. Biden did, though, kind of allude to the way that he thinks President Trump sees the world, the lens that he thinks the president sees the world through, accusing him of favoring Wall Street over Main Street -- Neil. CAVUTO: All right, thank you very much, Peter. So, a surprise from the John Roberts court. Let's go to that other equally famous John Roberts, our White House correspondent. (LAUGHTER) CAVUTO: John, what do you think? JOHN ROBERTS, FOX NEWS CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Neil, good afternoon to you. Well, one thing that appears to be clear at this point is that the November election is not going to be fought on the contents of the president's financial records or tax returns, because, even if Cyrus Vance, the Manhattan district attorney, does get ahold of some of those financial records -- and it's unclear when or if he will, because this is going to be argued again in the lower courts -- those are supposed to remain secret because they are grand jury materials. And, therefore, they should not get out into the public forum. And the fact that the Supreme Court shut down Congress means that those documents will not leak out of Capitol Hill anytime soon. And you can bet that, if the Supreme Court had have said Congress could go ahead and get their hands on those tax returns, they'd be in the hands of every reporter in Washington, D.C., at the moment. For the president, though, it does leave open the question, again, of the tax returns. And it's something that Joe Biden can continue to try to bait him with, particularly during the upcoming debates. Watch for that to be a big topic. But, so far, it appears on the surface that this is a win of sorts for the president, because it means that, even though the Manhattan district attorney can get his hands on that material, as it appears he can at this point -- but, again, further court action to come -- those tax returns and financial documents likely will not become public, at least not before the election. So it, for the most part, I think, takes that off the table in terms of an issue. CAVUTO: John, has the administration ever hinted, if this were to get out -- and, as you said, not an issue -- or the White House certainly hopes not an issue this year -- but to telegraph something or to telegraph features in there to sort of pre-dismiss? Do you know their thinking on this? ROBERTS: You know, I have never heard anything about trying to get some little snippets of it out there to try to take it off of the table. I think that they have just tried to keep it off of the table. That's really been the strategy. And the fact that there is nothing that will compel that to enter the public forum, I think, would probably preclude any sort of preemptive strike on the part of the Trump campaign or the White House to soften the blow of them eventually coming out. Don't forget, Michael Cohen, when he testified in front of Congress... CAVUTO: Right. ROBERTS: ... in 2019 said, the reason the president doesn't want these out there is because he doesn't want them to be picked over by a handful of accountants who are working on behalf of news organizations. And it's kind of ironic that Michael Cohen this morning tweeted through Lanny Davis, his representative, his approval of the Supreme Court decision, at least as far as the Manhattan district attorney goes, and then, within an hour, Cohen had been whisked back off to jail because he didn't agree with the media ban that was part of a home confinement agreement that probation officers had put in front of him. So his attorney, Jeffrey Levine, right now is trying desperately to get him out of the Metro Correctional Facility in Brooklyn. But it just shows, Neil, how small the circle really is when it comes to all of this stuff. CAVUTO: Yes, lesson for Cohen, don't eat at a public restaurant where people might have smartphones on their -- on their possession. ROBERTS: And might be taking pictures of you. CAVUTO: All right, John Roberts, thank you. ROBERTS: All right, you bet, Neil. Good to see you. CAVUTO: Well, absolutely. Thank you, my friend, John Roberts, on all of that. Well, both parties are already cementing their positions on this, predictably -- after this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. DAVID CICILLINE (D-RI): It's a really important victory for our democracy, for the ability of Congress to fulfill our constitutional responsibility, and a resounding defeat to a president who claimed he's above the law. JORDAN: What the Democrats are trying to do, go after the president of the United States' tax returns, go after his business records for the last 10 years, I think most Americans see this is kind of ridiculous. (END VIDEO CLIP) \u00a0(COMMERCIAL BREAK) CAVUTO: What if this has nothing to do with whether the president did anything illegal, and everything to do with how wealthy he is or is not? Charlie Gasparino on the raging debate in those financial records. How rich is he? (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PELOSI: A careful reading of the Supreme Court ruling related to the president's financial records is not good news for President Trump. The court has reaffirmed the Congress' authority to conduct oversight on behalf of the American people. REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA): It seems to me that the New York district attorney and others that have tried for it seems much more political than anything else. (END VIDEO CLIP) CAVUTO: Bottom line, in the Supreme Court twin rulings today on this very matter, it made a point of saying you, Congress, you, particularly congressional Democrats, cannot get your hands on these documents anytime soon. And that was interpreted as a victory for the president here, because many of them want to have possession of those, and the sooner, the better. Chad Pergram on what happens now on Capitol Hill. Hey, Chad. CHAD PERGRAM, FOX NEWS CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Hey, Neil. Well, this is one of the better outcomes that actually Democrats could have here in the House of Representatives. I'm going to come at this kind of through a backdoor way, the idea that they wanted to get their hands on these documents here, but they really didn't. They had a lot of trepidation about starting another big investigation. So the fact that the high court basically said, you can assert your Article 1 oversight responsibilities, but you can't get these documents yet, that helps Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats politically, especially after what happened with impeachment. Listen to the house speaker from this morning. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PELOSI: And some of them tell me they want to go down that road. But we have a path that the Supreme Court has laid out that we certainly will not ignore, and we will never stop our oversight that is our responsibility under the Constitution of the United States. (END VIDEO CLIP) PERGRAM: Not releasing the returns allows Democrats to stoke conjecture and speculation about what's in the president's tax records and insinuate he has something to hide. And that's what bothers Republicans like Jim Jordan of Ohio months before an election. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JORDAN: If Congress has the ability to look at President Trump's tax returns and everything else, you're talking about Nancy Pelosi, Adam Schiff, Maxine Waters auditing the president, I think that's a terrifying thing, based on what we have seen them do over the last four years. (END VIDEO CLIP) PERGRAM: Now, Neil, there was a Supreme Court case in 1962, Hutcheson v. the U.S. here. And there was a labor leader by the name of Maurice Hutcheson, who said he was being harassed by a Senate committee to get documents and information. Testimony, basically, is what the Senate committee wanted. It went to the Supreme Court, and the Supreme Court says, yes, you have to provide that information, if they have a compelling legislative reason. And that's basically what they said today. Only, they said the House can't have those documents just yet -- Neil. CAVUTO: Chad Pergram, thank you very, very much, my friend. To Congressman Tom McClintock, Republican of California, sits on the very crucial House Judiciary Committee. Congressman, what do you make of where this now goes? REP. TOM MCCLINTOCK (R-CA): Well, first, we have to understand what's going on. This is a well-established pattern the Democrats have set throughout the Trump administration. They will allege something absolutely nefarious, launch an ostentatious investigation. They will then leak every innuendo and half-truth that they can come up with. And then, when nothing comes of it, they simply move on to the next pseudo-scandal. And that's exactly what's going on here. Frankly, I think these are big wins for the president. In the Vance case, the Supreme Court said what it's been saying for more than 200 years, is that the president, just like everybody else, if he has evidence relevant to a case, that is subject to subpoena. But the court also said that, just like every other person, the president is protected from, among other things, subpoenas issued in bad faith. Well, the Vance investigation reeks of bad faith. Among other things, what he's asking for is strikingly similar to what the congressional Democrats did in their laundry list. There was obviously collusion going on. And if you notice, the Supreme Court didn't say, turn over the documents. The Supreme Court said, go back to the lower court and make your case. And I think that will be a case very easy to make. And with respect to the congressional fishing expedition, where the Democrats subpoenaed every check, every credit card swipe, every debit withdrawal by every member of the Trump family, the court said, you know, this kind of looks like a fishing expedition to us. They imposed a four-part test that makes it impossible for the Democrats to continue with those subpoenas, and sent it back to the lower courts for enforcement. So, I think these were both big wins for the president. CAVUTO: You know, woulda, shoulda, coulda, and we could easily play Monday morning quarterback here. If the president really has nothing untoward or illegal in those -- in those tax records -- and a lot of people give him the benefit of doubt on that, that he doesn't. Maybe there's other things about his wealth or, because of perfectly legal tax reasons, he didn't pay taxes because of huge losses early on in his casino empire. We just don't know. Those were some of the early reports that came out. Could he have avoided all of this during the campaign or soon thereafter releasing pertinent information, because he was the only prominent candidate who hasn't in modern times? And it's come back to bite him. What do you think? MCCLINTOCK: I don't think that would have been wise, because the pattern the Democrats have established is, it shows us they will look for anything, pull it out of context, and use it. Someone with the extensive business empire of the president is going to have a very, very large bank of accountants and lawyers preparing the tax records. There's probably nothing untoward in them. And I think what he realizes is, they will use anything they can get, even something that is perfectly legal and aboveboard. CAVUTO: But, no, I guess what I'm saying is, if all this was thrashed out in the middle of the campaign, where Americans really didn't make a big deal of it one way or the other, he was voted in as president regardless, this would all be a moot point now. MCCLINTOCK: Well, I think it's rather a moot point anyway. These are all personal attacks against Donald Trump. Not one of them has to do with public policy matters that actually affect people's lives. On that, his record is very clear. We were enjoying the greatest economic expansion of our lifetimes, until the COVID lockdowns by Democratic governors. CAVUTO: Got it. Congressman, great catching up with you. Be well. MCCLINTOCK: Thank you. You too. CAVUTO: All right, Congressman McClintock here. Well, the bottom line is here, this would not be the first president where they start digging into his financial past. Some do very, very well with that, others not so much. Stay with us. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) \u00a0(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KAYLEIGH MCENANY, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: On the principle of absolute immunity, which is the posture that the -- that the president took in court, he believes there should have been more deference there. (END VIDEO CLIP) CAVUTO: The bottom line is, money might be the mother's milk of politics, but those who have it -- and Donald Trump is our richest president ever -- some say it's John Kennedy, if you talk family wealth -- the fact of the matter is, money can also become a focal point in a campaign. But rarely has it ended a campaign or, for that matter, a presidency. Let's go to Professor Barbara Perry, the director of presidential studies at UVA's Miller Center. Professor, good to have you. We don't know what's in these tax returns. I get that, know that. But history suggests that issues that have come up with money and all of that that have affected either those who've been vice president rarely amount to something that gets them forced out of office. But frame this for me. BARBARA PERRY, UVA MILLER CENTER: Well, you're absolutely right, Neil. And great to be with you today. It is the case that, so often, these scandals involve people around the president or vice president, but actually rarely involve the president himself. And then it's up to the American people to decide, is the president at the top of this administration that's understandable, because of someone in the Cabinet, or maybe those in the secretary's position working for the president who are involved, maybe members of Congress, is that enough to tar the president with the brush of scandal and, if they're coming up for reelection, take them out of office? CAVUTO: And, sometimes, the other side can get a little desperate too. When Richard Nixon was the vice president, he got a dog as a gift, the famous Checkers speech, where he said he wasn't going to give up the dog. It looked like he was teetering as Eisenhower's running mate, but he survived it. PERRY: He did. There was what people called the slush fund, in addition to the cocker spaniel. But, yes, there were people who they put money aside for him. And so it came to be known as a slush fund. And it garnered so much information and media that he had to go on television, which was quite the thing in 1952, sitting there with his wife, Pat. CAVUTO: Right. PERRY: And then he actually went through all of his finances. He talked about his mortgage, what kind of car he drove, what kind of loans they had, and then came to this conclusion about the little dog Checkers had been a gift from a supporter, and that he and his two little daughters were not going to give Checkers up. CAVUTO: You know, John Kennedy dealt with the family wealth thing by making fun of it, but he couldn't hide the fact he had a lot of money, right? So I'm wondering if the same would apply to Donald Trump, assuming there's no illegality there, but he has a lot of money. PERRY: Right. Well, the way to do it is, as you say, John Kennedy did. He once at the Gridiron Dinner read out of fake, if you will, telegram from his dad, but pretended it was real and said: \"Dear Jack, don't buy one more vote than necessary. I will be damned if I will pay for a landslide.\" (LAUGHTER) PERRY: So that's part of the way he handled it. But he also had to go toe to toe with Eleanor Roosevelt in '58-'59, who was spreading word that his dad was buying the election for him. So, he was going back and forth in letters with her. Finally, she sort of threw in the towel on it, because he said, if you have evidence, let's see it, but I don't think you will. CAVUTO: All right, Professor, I so wish we had more time. It's a great perspective on all that. We will be following it closely here. But there is, to the professor's point, a reminder here. Money might be the root of a lot of problems, but not necessarily political ones that get you heaved out of office. We will see. More after this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SCANLON: I think, yes, the fact that the Supreme Court rejected the argument that the president is above the law is a big win. (END VIDEO CLIP) (COMMERCIAL BREAK) \u00a0CAVUTO: Well, Democrats might be rubbing their hands together on this Supreme Court twin decision today. Keep in mind that the latter decision, the one that does not give congressional Democrats what they wanted, namely, the president's tax returns and their financial records, well, they're going to have to wait, and maybe quite a while on that. To Robert Wolf, big Democratic operative, the former UBS chairman, very big in the financial community as well. Robert, just listening to a number of Democrats today, they seem to be seizing on this as, aha, we got him. Are they aha-ing too soon? ROBERT WOLF, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: I mean, listen, this populist rhetoric about the Trump taxes has is great fodder. The truth is, he should have shown them already. Vice President Biden has shown his. Every president before has shown theirs. This is nonsense. Whatever he's hiding, he should just show them. He's the president of the United States. But I think the reason that Democrats are excited today, Neil, is because Vice President Biden put out a great economic recovery plan about rebuilding America and building America and buying America and investing in America. And, actually, Steve Bannon just said, what a great plan that was that Biden came out with. So, I think the Dems feel pretty good right now that the vice president put out one of his four pillars of how to rebuild the economic recovery. CAVUTO: Well, some will disagree with you on whether that was a great plan, but I hear where you're coming from, Robert. The former vice president is arriving at his ancestral home in Scranton, New Jersey -- I'm sorry -- Scranton, Pennsylvania. So that's a big event for them. Obviously, he's trying to contrast himself: I'm not a billionaire. He's done very well post leaving the public life, after he became vice president, with speeches and other events. It made him a very wealthy man. But, again, he is trying to compare, well, I'm regular Joe. I'm Scranton, Pennsylvania, Joe. Is that connecting? And does this news of the president and his taxes and all that, does that connect in a way? WOLF: I do think it connects. And I think they're really not non sequiturs, right? You have someone who - - as your prior guest said, who's very wealthy that seems to be hiding something. And you have someone that is blue-collar Joe, who really is reaching out to industrial America, the unions. I mean, as Joe would say, the blue-collar guys, they shower after work. And I think that people are connecting with him. I think that's a reason he's doing so well in the polls. Granted, the polls are months ahead of what the election will be. CAVUTO: Do you think, though -- you think about that, though, Robert, do you think that his move, just speaking as a former top Wall Street financier -- you're still a top finance guy -- but the argument for raising taxes at this time, the corporate rate and all that, the president has always and come back and say, well, you're all for raising taxes, and I'm not. What do you think? WOLF: Yes, I think two things. One, we didn't need to go from 35 percent to 21 percent. So, actually, I think, if we went from 35 to 28, corporate America would be ringing the bell, ecstatic. So, one, I think the idea that Joe's talking about going to 28 percent is not going to surprise anyone. Number two, the one thing you and I have discussed the years, the one thing we know that follows a war, which this pandemic is, is taxes. Every war since the American Revolution, to the Civil War, to every war we can speak up, taxes follow wars, because you have to pay for the things we're doing, like we're doing today, to try to keep Middle America open and PPP. And, unfortunately, it's not going to be on the middle class, which is great. It's going to be on the upper class, and they're going to have to help pay for it. And they have in every war... (CROSSTALK) CAVUTO: Well, we will see, Robert. I don't mean to jump on you, my friend, but your candidate, Joe Biden... WOLF: Yes. CAVUTO: ... he was just speaking to reporters there. We're going to be following it as he sort of treks through Scranton here. But just to give you an idea there, he spent the day talking about an economic program he says will benefit more Americans, and not be titled to the rich and fat cats on Wall Street. I think he's talking about your old buddies, Robert, but who's to say? WOLF: That's all right. CAVUTO: We have a lot more coming up, including what could be in there that could help or hurt the president's reputation and image -- after this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BILL DE BLASIO (D), MAYOR OF NEW YORK: Donald Trump's the only public servant in America who thinks he can get away with withholding his financial disclosure. I mean, it's outrageous. (END VIDEO CLIP) (COMMERCIAL BREAK) CAVUTO: For years, for decades, it's been the number one question around Donald Trump: How wealthy is he? He has always had arguments and Forbes magazine and the like to say that they are not accounting for just how wealthy he is, and argues with them when they might be understating that wealth that he puts at many billions of dollars. Charlie Gasparino has covered him for quite some time and knows this could be at the heart of these disclosures here -- Charlie. CHARLIE GASPARINO, FOX NEWS SENIOR CORRESPONDENT: Yes. Neil, he actually sued a reporter once for suggesting he's worth less than a billion dollars. We should point that out as well. And he's had massive fights with Forbes magazine on just how wealthy he was, how many billions. CAVUTO: I remember, year in and year out, when they do their richest issue, right? GASPARINO: Right. So, it's -- this is something that is near and dear to his heart, to show that he's worth -- well, the latest -- his latest financial disclosures, I think he stated that he's worth $10 billion. Now, we should point out that tax returns themselves don't have like a number on it, I am worth X. It does show sources of income. It shows property. It shows various means that could get you to the end of how much he's worth. It will show how much charity -- charitable money he gives. He claims he gives a lot. I believe there's Trump charities. People have doubts about that. So, it's -- take out the potential illegality stuff. What a tax return would show is whether he's truthful in terms of how much money he gives to charity, whether he -- if you back out some of the numbers, whether he's worth $10 billion, whether he's taking every sort of tax break in the world. It could be pretty embarrassing stuff for the president, if the numbers don't match the... (CROSSTALK) CAVUTO: Or it could all be very, very legal. There were issues years ago, remember, when there were charges that he had huge losses back in the '90s and the late '80s, what have you, where you are allowed -- or you were allowed at the time to write that off over a number of years. So there could have been reports where he didn't pay taxes or very few -- little in taxes, as a result. That's something most people can't get a handle on, because they can't relate. There's nothing illegal about that or untoward about that. It was what it was, but it is going to be an issue now, right? GASPARINO: Right. And you know that real estate developers are notorious for taking every tax break. It's -- there's plenty of loopholes in the law. CAVUTO: Right. GASPARINO: I mean, there's nothing illegal about this. I think where this gets problematic is what Michael Cohen once said, if you can believe him, his former fixture, where he inflates his wealth for the insurance policy and deflates it for the tax purposes. That's where this is something else. And -- but if -- but, barring that, I think what his tax returns would show is some degree of embarrassment, if he -- if it doesn't match his rhetoric. CAVUTO: All right. GASPARINO: And his rhetoric was pretty off the charts on this stuff, as you know. CAVUTO: All right. We will watch it very closely. Thank you, Charlie, very much. But it's all about how wealthy the guy is. By the way, people around Joe Biden are jumping and doing a jig right now. They're seeing the lead in the polls and saying, man, we have got this, and after today, oh, man, we really got this. Michael Dukakis coming tomorrow to let Joe Biden know, don't get ahead of your political skis on this. There was a time I was up 20 points in the polls over George Bush Sr., and they were already calling me President Dukakis. What happened to that? Michael Dukakis tomorrow.

CHRIS WALLACE, FOX NEWS HOST: Liberal Democrats have been running cities in this country for decades. TRUMP: Poorly. WALLACE: Why is it so bad right now? TRUMP: They have run them poorly. It was always bad but now it's totally out of control. (END VIDEO CLIP) WATTERS: President Trump attacking Democrats in an interview with Chris Wallace that will air on Fox News Sunday. It comes as his administration in America's biggest cities take very different approaches to a surge in violence. Federal agents cracking down on protesters in Portland after the 50th night of demonstrations. Anarchists were threatening to burn down a police precinct before the cops stepped in. Oregon's Democrat governor called the move political theater. But acting DHS Chief Chad Wolf is calling her out for letting anarchy run wild. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CHAD WOLF, ACTING SECRETARY, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY: We continue to see violent activity, violent anarchists' night after night targeting those facilities. I think the concern that I have, or the local leadership, local and state leadership, they are fostering an environment where it's very difficult for law enforcement to do their job. And they are not coming out, in my view, in my opinion, coming out strong and of condemning the violent activity there in Portland.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MAYOR BILL DE BLASIO (D-NY), NEW YORK CITY: We now have fewer people in our jails than any time since World War II. And we are safer for it and better for it.

People who are exercising their first amendment constitutional rights to protest police brutality? WATTERS: No, the anarchists, Juan. WILLIAMS: You know, look. WATTERS: And the violent criminals and the vandals and the rioters. WILLIAMS: I think that Jesse -- Jesse -- Jesse, there are people who have engaged in unlawful activity that you've just described. They should be arrested. They are not, they are not even close to anywhere near the heart and soul of people who are concerned about standing up for racial justice in the country. (CROSSTALK) WATTERS: So why don't the mayors tell the police chiefs to separate out the bad guys and let the peaceful demonstrations go on? WILLIAMS: Of course, they do. (CROSSTALK) WATTERS: They're not doing that. WILLIAMS: That in fact, that's the situation on the bridge there in New York, it was a situation where church leaders had a separate march and then you had some of those vandals intervened and the police went after the vandals. No one is arguing that. But I just wanted to say to you I think the president here is playing on fear, anxiety, and emotion about the idea of peaceful marches, saying that there is police brutality in the country. And I can't deny anyone's fear or anxiety over what's going on in the country but I can say that if there's hard data, hard data that says there is no anarchy in our streets, the crime is relatively low in our streets at this time. And I think my real fear is the situation in Portland, because you have federal agents dressed in camouflage jumping out of unmarked cars, grabbing people, throwing them in jail, telling them they are under arrest then releasing them. That's a clear violation of who we are as a country. That sounds like some authoritarian state. Senator Ron Wyden said the president wants these confrontations because they play well in right-wing media and they divide the country. Governor Kate Brown said it's an abuse of federal power. All the mayors involved say we don't need federal agents in unmarked uniforms acting like some kind of authoritarian police. WATTERS: Well, those uniforms were marked. And if you look at the video you could see were the markings were on the shoulders, Juan. And if some people are breaking windows in a federal building and spray painting them, then I think the government can come in federally and clean it up. Greg, do you agree with Juan that is just a bunch of fear and there's really nothing to worry about? GREG GUTFELD, FOX NEWS HOST: The fear is legitimate and anybody who's been personally experiencing what's been going on in the streets know this and I won't even address it anymore. Because this justification is so old and stale. If there is no hard data. What about the spectacular increase in shootings and deaths? They actually dismantle the anti-crime unit in charge of getting illegal guns off the streets in New York and the shootings doubled. And you know who asked for the anti-crime unit back? The black leaders in New York City. Thank God they are asking for it to come back. So, if you actually believe that there is no hard data then you're basically living in a bubble. And there's -- I have to give them credit, though, the left are doing a great thing. They've created crime and chaos so that when Trump intervenes, he'll be painted as an autocrat. So, if you do anything about it, you're a tyrant. But if you do nothing, the crime surge goes unabated and so the citizens suffer, and the left would much rather have the citizens suffer than actually let Trump do the right thing because they hate him so much. But I have to hand it to America for being so dam patient. Basically there's 300 plus million people getting by in life while these miscreants are destroying the country. It reminds me of that scene from \"Witness\" where Harrison Ford is in the buggy and that jackass starts harassing him and putting ice cream on his face until finally Harrison Ford gets up and beats the crap out of him. We are heading in a direction where law-abiding citizens are going to have enough of this. Until we cooperate, and I mean the protesters and the police get together because it's destroying the protest movement. It's destroying the movement and it's going to reelect Trump. So, you better stop playing these dumb games and admit there's a problem. WATTERS: Yes. Even the fake Amish (ph) sometimes have to take matters into their own hands. GUTFELD: So true. WATTERS: Emily Compagno, when you look at some of these mayors, I guess in Portland or in Seattle, in Chicago, in New York City, wouldn't you think may be that they would not want to go down in the history books as just dangerous radicals that let anarchists take over their towns? EMILY COMPAGNO, FOX NEWS HOST: You would think, but unfortunately, that's exactly how they are going to go down in the history books. I have had the benefit of four decades living on the west coast and I'll tell you guys about how I see these Democratic mayors and leaders are emboldening these destructive violent protesters and also single-handedly making their cities fall into rot and disrepair. So, of these top ten most dangerous cities in the United States according to Forbes, not according to right-wing media, all of them are led by Democratic mayors. Of the top 10 highest instances of homelessness in cities, those are all led by Democratic mayors too and they are all sanctuary cities. So that means they refused to cooperate with federal law enforcement. Of the top 25 most dangerous cities, most are Democratic led and the poverty rates is up to three times that of the national average. So is unemployment. These are the statistics that don't lie, and when you're living there as a resident and you are seeing your incompetent, ineffective mayor refused to support law enforcement, refused to take a zero stance on violence and destruction while also acknowledging what needs to change and how, I don't understand why that's so difficult. But as a resident, you watch it helplessly as your law enforcement is attacked, is bloodied on air, is killed, and your cities being destroyed as companies are fleeing because they are getting no tax incentives as your taxes or raisings you can pay for the hazmat cleanup for the ICE building being occupied for five weeks and I could go on. But believe me, there plenty of statistics to back up why Democratic led cities are rotting. WATTERS: Kennedy, I'll give you the last word. KENNEDY MONTGOMERY, FOX NEWS HOST: Well, Juan is absolutely right. And Ron Wyden is right here that these images do help the president. And Kate Brown and Ted Wheeler, Ted Wheeler is the mayor of Portland. Kate Brown is the governor of Oregon. It is a total abdication of leadership on their part. And when you are hamstringing the police department because you have been neutered with the razor of wokeness, you are creating this environment that only grows and grows and limits people's freedom to associate and freedom to move throughout one of the most formerly livable cities in the world. I grew up in Portland. This is not the city that I know and love. And the fact that they have given over to this mob because they somehow want to be liked, that's not why you run for office. That's not why you become mayor. There has to be leadership here. And there is utter hypocrisy. You see it from coast-to-coast and that's why for the first time when I talk to people in New York and California, they are talking about moving to places like Texas and Tennessee which not only have more favorable tax environments but there's also a greater freedom to be enjoyed here. Because when there is no leadership, people give up at the shrugs and they leave and then the cities finally collapsed. So, you want every city in this country to be like Detroit in 2014? God, I hope not. WATTERS: I think you're right. Coming up, White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany hit with one of the nastiest smears yet. We'll show you next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) MONTGOMERY: Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot attacking Kayleigh McEnany, accusing the White House press secretary of being a Karen, after she called the mayor derelict over the surge of violence in that city. Here's McEnany responding on Watters World that airs this weekend. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KAYLEIGH MCENANY, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: I'm very upset about the violence in the streets of her city. You know, she is focused on words but instead she should be focused on actions. I understand the truth hurts. The president has written her a letter and offered her help, and she needs to take it. (END VIDEO CLIP) MONTGOMERY: And CNN's Jim Acosta getting slammed for taking the press secretary out of context. Acosta claimed McEnany said that the science should not stand in the way of reopening schools but here's what really happened. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MCENANY: The science should not stand in the way of this and as Dr. Scott Atlas said, I thought this was a good quote of course, we can do it, everyone else in the western world our peer nations are doing it. We are the outlier here. The science is on our side here. We encourage for localities and states to just simply follow the science, open our schools. (END VIDEO CLIP) MONTGOMERY: Jesse, tell me a little bit more about that interview with Kayleigh. What else did she say? WATTERS: She mentioned that Jim Acosta is the kind of guy that's a real jerk when the cameras go on and then afterwards, he's the nicest guy in the world. It's like the opposite of me. I'm like so nice on TV but then I'm a jerk in real life. I just keep -- GUTFELD: I doubt. WATTERS: Yes, Gutfeld can vouch. GUTFELD: Yes. WATTERS: Honestly, I think the mayor of Chicago needs to start Karen a little bit more about her people dying because that's the point here. It's funny how a lot of these liberal mayors were begging the president for all this federal aid during the pandemic but then when black on black crime was surging and people's stores were being robbed and fires were burning, they didn't want any of the president's help all of a sudden. I think the memo went out to Democratic mayors that we have to refuse the president's help because the president is getting good press when that happens. So, they'd rather stop the president from getting good press than stopping their own people being killed. It is weird, though, that she says well, if he really wanted to help, he would, you know, make sure people that were on no-fly lists couldn't buy guns or do more background checks or ban assault rifles. Does the mayor of Chicago really think the people squeezing the triggers are on no-fly list or they're buying their guns illegally or they are really using AR-15's instead of handguns? The fact that we buy this line from her without challenging her makes you realize how corrupt this whole media deal is. MONTGOMERY: Well, Juan, it's also, I mean, it's really kind of worthless to just engage in this partisan bickering. And it's really easy for the mayors, you know, the president needs to shut his face because as Kate Brown said too in Oregon. But wouldn't it be a little bit better if some of these mayors actually came up of a list of things that they were doing and that they were going to put in place in the near future to make their city safer? To make people, citizens there feel better? Wouldn't you rather hear that from Lori Lightfoot? WILLIAMS: Look, I think, Kennedy, she's a local official, she's elected by the people of Chicago. She answers to the people of Chicago. And I would imagine they have demands and pressures on her, the council members and the rest, state officials as well in time to protect their citizens. I just don't see it as a federal responsibility. That's not the way our country is structured. We don't run in and tell local officials how to run their schools, how to run their police department unless you want to make it a political issue. And with regard to Kayleigh McEnany, listen, I think that if you're the chief communications officer for the President of the United States, you need to be clear and precise in your language. Everyone knows the president wants schools to reopen this fall. So, she can't start making the case by saying science should not start -- stand in the way before she gets to citing a scientist and citing documents, because guess what, people are going to say, wait, you said science shouldn't stand in the way. And then she says you took me out of context. No, I think she was not clear, she was not precise. (CROSSTALK) MONTGOMERY: Even Jim Acosta's -- WILLIAMS: And people are -- MONTGOMERY: -- coworker Jake Tapper said that he unfairly took her out of context. And by the time he -- (CROSSTALK) WILLIAMS: Correct. I think -- MONTGOMERY: -- by the time he tweeted out a correction, he had already gotten 30,000 likes on that tweet. So, that part of it is dishonest. And there are -- there are teachers -- WILLIAMS: No. MONTGOMERY: There are academics, there are scientists, there are doctors. There are parents, there are kids who wants schools to open, so she's not alone in that. WILLIAMS: Yes. MONTGOMERY: And that is not simply a -- (CROSSTALK) WILLIAMS: No, I'm not saying that. MONTGOMERY: As far as the cities, yes, the cities need to be run by the officials. Unfortunately, a lot of these cities we're talking about are being run into the ground. Greg, let's talk about the most important issue here, though. (CROSSTALK) WILLIAMS: Well, that's up to local officials. GUTFELD: Well, wait a second. Can I, Kennedy -- (CROSSTALK) MONTGOMERY: When local officials are doing a bad job, they should be thrown out of office if they're doing a bad job. Greg, go ahead. GUTFELD: Kennedy, this -- (CROSSTALK) WILLIAMS: That's up to local voters. MONTGOMERY: OK. OK. Very quick. GUTFELD: It's interesting that their bodies piling up, Juan says that's a local issue but when it's a police incident it becomes a national story that involves every single media outlet that causes protests and then later riots and looting. It's a national, it's a global that affects England. But when there are bodies piling up in Chicago, it's a local issue. Mind your own business. Look, we saw -- (CROSSTALK) WILLIAMS: That's not right. GUTFELD: We saw with Acosta. We saw with Acosta that Trump is right. That fake news is the enemy of the people. One of the most powerful statements since tear down this wall and it's really good that we see this in action because every day the public gets more and more red pilled. That is the media that is manipulating the news in order to create dissent so that they can get more clicks. And they don't just do this by the way to public figures like Kayleigh. If you've ever been the subject of a story and you know you weren't treated fairly because there's always an inclination for a reporter to create a sensation out of nothing. You know, a beach --- a beach without a shark attack is just a beach. So, you need that shark attack. But I've got to tell you, finally, it is a joy to watch Kayleigh because it provides a contrast. What you have on one side in the press corps are these whiny, petty dudes, right, compared to the stoic terminator shooting lasers made of facts into their dissident brains is a positive joy for me. It makes my day every day. MONTGOMERY: And then you can make your night tomorrow night by watching not only the Greg Gutfeld show but also -- GUTFELD: Yes. MONTGOMERY: -- Watters World and you can see that exclusive interview with Kayleigh McEnany. But of the most important issue here truly, Emily, is the abuse of the term Karen. Don't take Karen from us, because if you just throw Karen around in the wrong way, we don't get to use it and we don't get to enjoy it and maybe that is the greatest miscarriage of justice. I appeal to you. COMPAGNO: I rule affirmatively on that. Look, I -- I'll speak to Mayor Lightfoot's tweet. The whole watch your mouth or what? Why doesn't she watch her town? The statistics coming out of Chicago are undeniable. Nine children have been shot to death under the age of 18 since June 20th. And she talks about being left alone but the pandemic has exacerbated all of the stressors in those communities that are experiencing the most violence to begin with. Right? Like unemployment spiking and infection rates and death rates. So, for her to focus on this to throw around Karen to basically threaten Kayleigh and then ignore her own town which is rotting and festering, again, I think she should watch her residence. She should watch her children and she should probably listen to those residents who are saying enough is enough. MONTGOMERY: Amen. I feel her -- I feel your frustration and hopefully these leaders will tap into that and they will at some point sprout a pair and lead. Excellent. All right. Coming up next, Joe Biden fully embracing the far left. What he just did and how bad will it hurt him come November. That's next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) WILLIAMS: Welcome back. Joe Biden is leading in the polls but will adopting ideas from progressive cost him in November? Biden who painted himself as more of a moderate during the primaries is now embracing some of the policies from his former Democratic rivals. Axios out today with a report on, quote, \"how Warren is shaping Biden's policies.\" And the Washington Post noting, quote, \"Biden's vision comes into view, and it's much more liberal than it was.\" End quote. Kennedy, the president has tried to define Joe Biden as too close to China, a doddering old man. Too hard on crime in the '90s now he's too soft on crime. Is the problem here that people know Joe Biden and like him? MONTGOMERY: I think that is probably the biggest problem for the president is that he's a likable person and as I've said before he's not Hillary Clinton. And she really activated people to come out and vote against her. It was -- it was unprecedented. Man, was she a bad nominee? Joe Biden, this is interesting because normally when we had towards the general election you see something called triangulation where someone who ran pretty far left as a Democrat now tries to move to the center in order to get those necessary independent voters. What Joe Biden is doing is called strangulation because we've seen the failure of big government over and over and over again on both sides, to be completely fair. And so, what he is offering through the status and socialist policies that Elizabeth Warren and people like AOC and Bernie Sanders have to offer is even more government which means even more problems. And I think that is -- that will cost him points. Will it cost him the election? Maybe not, but it's a really bad way for the former vice president to define himself right now. WILLIAMS: Emily, what about tying Joe Biden to Elizabeth Warren? Do you think that could work for the president? Will people buy it? COMPAGNO: They probably will because Biden is doing it to himself. Now, he bent over backwards to impart that his green economy plan would somehow all go to union jobs, but they're not buying it. Jim Snell, the business agent for the Steamfitters said I am shocked and stunned at the language coming out of Biden's mouth allegedly a union guy. The Democratic Party has kicked the trade unions to the curb. And interestingly, former U.S. Congressman Ryan Costello said that the swing voters in Pennsylvania, they used to be suburban women, and now they will be those building tradesmen. WILLIAMS: All right, Jesse, A lot of the Democratic strategists right now are saying at this point in the campaign, most candidates have already defined their opponent and try to then use it. But I wonder, is it too late at this point in the game. We're about, you know, three to four months away from the vote. WATTERS: It's never too late. Biden is blowing is, Juan. All he had to do is stay in a moderate lane, and he's just gone off the rails to the left. He just needs to stay moderate so he's competitive in battlegrounds. But I think what's happening is his campaign manager, they know the real polls, not the ones really under sample Republicans by 10 points to get like a really bad frame job on the president. The real poll show Biden has a really bad enthusiasm gap with the President. S1o the only thing they think they need to do is juice enthusiasm with the left-wing base to juice turnout. The way they're doing it is go into Bernie and have Bernie call the shots. That's just a really dumb idea because now if you look at the poly see positions that Joe Biden has, he's for taxpayer-funded partial-birth abortion on demand. I mean, he's for sanctuary cities. His health care program covers illegal immigrants. And when you close your eyes in the dark, you can't tell in a blind taste test the difference between Sanders' health care plan, and Joe Biden's. He's raising taxes, he's going to hit everybody with regulations, and he's letting Beto confiscate guns. So, he really screwed this up, Juan. I mean, if I was an advisor, I could tell Joe Biden had to beat Donald Trump. I won't, because I won't. But it's not that difficult if he just stays normal, but he went off the Crazy Train and fell into the socialism trap. WILLIAMS: Hey, Greg, you know, the biggest item these days is the virus obviously. And today the Washington Post is out with numbers that show widespread disapproval in almost every category of voters on the President's handling of the virus. So does that make this just a referendum on Trump and really make defining or smearing Biden not relevant? GUTFELD: Well, it would -- it would mean something if people also had suggestions. Like, say what is -- what is Trump doing wrong and what you could do to make it better. Biden has that -- hasn't done that. In fact, no Democrats have done that. They sit there and they complain, but they don't have any tips on how to do it better. Look, Biden isn't far left, he's far gone. If he thinks demilitarizing the military would placate the left, he'd do it. This guy is so malleable, he makes Gumby look like John Kerry. I think he should -- and I think he should pick Liz Warren. After all, she's a woman of color, she's the first lady astronaut, and she discovered penicillin. She is the greatest woman that ever lived and I think you should pick her. WILLIAMS: Wow, we'll take that is an endorsement. GUTFELD: Yes. WILLIAMS: Kanye West dropping new hints on his 2020 presidential run. More on that in the \"FASTEST SEVEN\" next on THE FIVE. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) COMPAGNO: Welcome back. Time for the \"FASTEST SEVEN.\" First up, Kanye West moving full speed ahead with his 2020 presidential bid tweeting a photo of his face on Mount Rushmore after making his way onto the presidential ballot in Oklahoma. All right, Kennedy, what do you think? Can you see it? MONTGOMERY: Absolutely. I think it's going to be fantastic. And I think -- I think Biden and Trump are both going to drop out of the race. I would love to see Jo Jorgensen really put up a good fight on the libertarian side, but I think Kanye has the edge here. And after that visual, he could bring the country together and really save the nation with that profile. COMPAGNO: Greg, what do you think? GUTFELD: Number one, it's going exactly according to plan. Kanye knows that to win as president, you got to run like three times, right? So, the first time you put your toe in the water, and then the next time you last a little bit longer, and then the next time your name is synonymous with running for president goes hand in hand. I have to criticize you, Kennedy. I don't think whatever her name, Jorgensen, is a real libertarian. I think she's a virtue signaler. KENNEDY: She's got a lot of heat this week, but she has been through the crucible of liberty. And I think there are always bumps in the road for candidates and I think she'll come out victorious in her own realm, which is saying that you'll get two percent of the vote. GUTFELD: Pestilence. COMPAGNO: So, Jesse, what do you think? Is Kanye taking a playbook page from Biden and will he maybe be successful three times from now? WATTERS: Does anybody have any idea what Kennedy and Gutfeld just talked about? I mean, what the hell was that? Anyway -- KENNEDY: Don't tread on me, Watters. WATTERS: OK. I just -- I just think that if Sleepy Joe loses to Donald Trump by a few thousand votes in Wisconsin or Pennsylvania, and it's because thousands of Black Americans wrote in Kanye West in Philly or Milwaukee, it's just going to be so delicious. COMPAGNO: Juan, what do you predict will happen with Kanye's election bid? WILLIAMS: I think he must have a new album coming out Emily. I think this is publicity. He has -- he has no idea what -- you know, about registering to get on the ballot in states and he's missed some already. I just think - - WATTERS: Write them in. WILLIAMS: -- you know, he doesn't understand what it really takes to be president. But I think that what Jesse just said is true. I think that the Trump supporters would love to have somebody -- they think that black folks would all vote for Kanye. I don't think that. I think Kanye has a lot of white fan. WATTERS: Hey, white college students too, Juan. WILLIAMS: That's what I was saying. COMPAGNO: All right, guys, next up, Coronavirus lockdowns make us all want to scream apparently. That was an advertisement from Iceland's Tourism Board encouraging people to submit their screams. The country says it will play them throughout the empty countryside if people can't do it in person. Jesse, your thoughts. WATTERS: I really don't have any thoughts on this. I didn't really know we were going to be doing this topic. Iceland, really? COMPAGNO: You don't need to prepare for this. WATTERS: This would be a great place to quarantine. That's all I have to say about that. COMPAGNO: Kennedy, they -- Iceland went through this awesome tourism marketing campaign that actually really worked about using their airport as a flyover, and then this happened. Do you think this is two steps backward for them? KENNEDY: Yes, I don't think this one is necessary. I like I like Bjork and we'll leave it there. I hear that Iceland is a lovely place to visit. They got a lot of hot springs and stuff. But screaming, it makes me very uncomfortable and nervous. WATTERS: Is Bjork a libertarian, Kennedy. Let's talk about that. KENNEDY: She's actually running for the libertarian nomination in Iceland. Her last name is Gudmundsdottir. WATTERS: OK. COMPAGNO: Juan, what do you think about this? WILLIAMS: Aren't the Japanese telling people not to scream on their roller coasters because that would spread the virus? I noticed in those videos, you don't have any mask on the people. So, I think they've got to be careful there, Emily. COMPAGNO: And Greg, take us home with this one. GUTFELD: Well, there's 300 -- what, 364,000 people in Iceland, so if you scream, no one is really going to hear you. The only thing I could say about Iceland. I've been there. It's beautiful. I ate a puffin. It tasted like licorice and shoelaces. WATTERS: No, Greg, you can't do that. GUTFELD: Yes, I ate a puffin and it didn't scream, not one bit. COMPAGNO: No, no. I don't believe that. WATTERS: No, you're not allowed to do that. GUTFELD: Yes, I ate a puffin. COMPAGNO: All right, \"FAN MAIL FRIDAY\" is up next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) GUTFELD: Yes, it's \"FAN MAIL FRIDAY.\" We're answering your questions. The first question is from Terry. Who is your favorite author and why? Jesse, I know you read a lot. WATTERS: Tolkien. GUTFELD: Tolkien? COMPAGNO: Yes, yes, I love him too, Jesse. Great. WATTERS: Thank you, Emily. Thank you. The second is Gutfeld. GUTFELD: You can't even take the hint. You can't even take the hint. WATTERS: The second is Gutfeld. I almost had it. GUTFELD: Kennedy, who's your favorite author? KENNEDY: Plato. I love Socratic dialogues. Big fan. GUTFELD: Who doesn't? Who doesn't? He's no Plotinus, though. Juan? KENNEDY: It sounds dirty. WILLIAMS: I'm a big fan of -- COMPAGNO: I know. WILLIAMS: I'm a big fan of Ralph Ellison who wrote Invisible Man, which I think is one -- is the greatest book of the 20th century so I got to -- I got to say Ralph Ellison. WATTERS: The movie was better than the book one. GUTFELD: Are you thinking about the original Invisible Man, Jesse? WILLIAMS: They're very different movie, Jesse. WATTERS: I'm thinking about the one out in Netflix right now. COMPAGNO: I just saw that the other night too. GUTFELD: I'm going to -- I'm going to go with -- OK, Emily, you're going to say Tolkien? COMPAGNO: Well, no, because Jesse already took it. So what I was doing to say was that I have a new mystery suspense author that I totally love. Her name is Tana French. She's out of Dublin, Ireland. I love every book that she has written. I highly recommend her. GUTFELD: I will recommend and I always do -- WILLIAMS: I can agree. GUTFELD: I don't even like fiction, but I love Jim Thompson. If you've ever read the Killer Inside Me, or the Grifters, which was a movie, or Population 1280, probably the best pulp writer of all time. He makes your skin crawl just reading him. And they're really short books too. They're disgusting. OK. Becky D. asks, what is one bad habit you had when you were younger but have since managed to stop? Kennedy? KENNEDY: I stopped -- no, I can't say that. No, that was -- that's a bad joke and I'm not allowed to tell that. Bad habit I managed to stop, I used to -- I used to count things a lot. I used to count things a lot. I guess it was like OCD and I worried if I didn't count things that something bad would happen to me. And fortunately, I don't -- I don't do that anymore. GUTFELD: I count things all the time. I count the days I have left on this planet, Emily. I'm sure you had some bad habits. COMPAGNO: Well, yes. I will say that I think I have -- I've improved my listening habits. I'm sure when I was a child, I think I was more like distractible, and now I am a more conscientious listener. GUTFELD: Oh, that's nice. Juan, how about you? What bad habits Did you have when you were younger that is no longer here? WILLIAMS: I trying -- you know, I think a lot of junk food, Greg. And I was thinking, you know, right now the baseball players aren't allowed to spit their sunflower seeds. And as a kid, I used to spit all the time with those sunflower seeds. Like you know, I don't do that anymore. I don't even eat sunflower seeds. I'm not in anybody's dugout. GUTFELD: What about you, Jesse? WATTERS: Crystal meth. From 2009 to 2014. I don't even remember. Apparently, I did a bunch of \"WATTERS' WORLD\" on the street. I have no idea. GUTFELD: You don't remember those ads they show the before and after. You actually ended up becoming better when you're on it because you were so horrible. WATTERS: Yes, I was born with meth mouth, and now this is what happened. GUTFELD: I'm with Juan, though. I had -- when I was younger, I told -- when I was 15, I said that I wanted a McDonald's in my house if I ever got rich. If I ever got rich, I was going to have a jack in the box or a McDonald's in my house. And now it's like, I can afford to eat that every single day. And I haven't had McDonald's in at least three weeks. It's killing me. WATTERS: We can tell, Greg. You look great. Is that what you were looking for? You look great. GUTFELD: Yes, that's exactly what I was looking for. Am I running out of time or do I have one more? One more. What are you secretly good at that no one knows? Emily? COMPAGNO: Well, so many things. I'll say dancing, but I feel like you guys know that because I cheered. GUTFELD: Well, I haven't seen you dance. COMPAGNO: That's boring. I'm sorry. GUTFELD: That was terrible. COMPAGNO: I know. GUTFELD: Juan, what's something that's surprisingly good nobody knows about that you're good at? WILLIAMS: Well, gee, I don't know. I'm pretty proud of what I do in the gym, but I don't -- you know, it's --at my age, I'm just trying to stay alive, Greg. GUTFELD: Yes, I hear you. WILLIAMS: We saw you in Houston, Juan, you have some speed. Come on. GUTFELD: What about you, Jesse? WILLIAMS: You're very kind. GUTFELD: What would -- what would surprise us that you're good at? Humility? WATTERS: That's a personal question. That's a personal question. And that's not the -- that's not the type of show that we're doing here tonight. GUTFELD: So you can't -- oh, I get it now. All right, Kennedy. KENNEDY: I'm good at untying knots. I can untie any not whether it's a necklace or string. For some reason, that's -- I'm really good at that. GUTFELD: Wow. You know, that actually is a talent because that's -- I cannot undo knots because I don't have any fingernails. WATTERS: Because you bite them. GUTFELD: Yes, I'm really, really good at biting fingernails. WATTERS: That's your bad habit. GUTFELD: I can bite fingernails to a point where that doesn't hurt. I know exactly when to stop. Yes, I messed up. All right, let's go. \"ONE MORE THING\" is up next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) WATTERS: It's time now for \"ONE MORE THING.\" Greg? GUTFELD: All right, tomorrow night, the \"GREG GUTFELD SHOW,\" Saturday 10:00 p.m. We've got Dave Rubin. We've got some lady named Emily. We have Kat Timpf and Tyrus. That's 10:00 p.m. Watch it so I could beat Jesse. All right, let's do this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GUTFELD: Animals are great. Animals are great. Animals are great. (END VIDEO CLIP) GUTFELD: Jesse beat me in the demo by 10,000. It can't happen again. WATTERS: Don't bite your nails anymore over that, Greg. GUTFELD: All right, I love ping pong. I love watching ping pong. Check out this fellow here enjoying the greatness Have a great ping pong match. It's like -- it's like a viewer at home watching and Jesse and Juan argue forever. This is exactly what it's like. Isn't that great? Look at that. I could watch this for days. Yes. All right, that's enough. WATTERS: All right, speaking of animals, a kangaroo was arrested, of course in Florida. We don't know what the kangaroo did. We think the kangaroo toppled the statue of Ponce de Leon. But he's not talking to investigators, so we're going to have to wait and see how he pleads in kangaroo court which he will be going to momentarily. COMPAGNO: Oh my God, he really is behind bars. WATTERS: Oh yes. COMPAGNO: Oh my, God. WATTERS: Oh yes. He didn't -- they don't have bail reform down there so he had to spend the night in the slammer. All right, \"WATTERS' WORLD\" 8:00 p.m. We are going to have a Watters' words here that makes Joe Biden unlikable. Juan says he's likable. After you Watters' words, you're going to realize how unlikeable he is. Don't miss it. Kennedy? KENNEDY: It's been disgusting for subway fights lately. Anyone who's written rails in New York City knows that. In Singapore, look at these dirty rats. They took it up a notch. Yes, look at these two. They're just fighting like crazy. But the best part is there's a cat lurking in the distance watching these to exhaust themselves because the cat knows as soon as they're completely spent -- because we all know that boxing is the most cardio heavy sport there is. The cat is going to swoop in on both. He's going to have a meal and leftovers. Take that you dirty rats. See, that's the cat going in. Keep going. COMPAGNO: Oh my gosh. WATTERS: That's like when Juan and Greg fight and I have to break it up. Juan, you're u. WILLIAMS: Thank goodness. All right, so guys, life is full of surprises. One day, you're walking down the street and all of a sudden, your ears perk up. You look over and there's a 71-year-old guy testing an old piano left as junk on the street, and you think that guy's pretty good. Take a look. Yes, that's Billy Joel, the five-time Grammy winner. Billy Joel got off his motorcycle in Huntington, Long Island. When he saw the piano, he ran through some tunes as people stopped to listen. Joel told the passers-by that piano is in good shape and should go to the local church. Way to go, Piano Man. WATTERS: That's right. When you leave your junk on the street, Elton John comes along and plays it. KENNEDY: Billy Joel. COMPAGNO: Elton John, Billy Joel, that's amazing. WATTERS: Billy Joel, Elton John. COMPAGNO: OK, you guys, today is World Emoji Day. And according to emoji- pedia, the two most popular ones are faced with tears of joy and loudly crying face. And here are some of my favorite emojis. And of course, everyone who knows me, you know I love to bitmoji. This is my favorite, always excited. I love you guys. Happy World Emoji Day. WATTERS: That's right. And Elton John, I'm sorry about that, and Billy Joel, whoever you are.

Seventy-two\u00a0Republicans and one Libertarian, Rep. Justin Amash of Michigan, joined with all Democrats in passing the legislation.Several members of the Congressional Black Caucus Wednesday talked personally about the painful history of slavery and oppression in the United States, which has been on the national conscience\u00a0since\u00a0 sparked global protests for racial justice.\"Just imagine what it feels like as an African American to know that my ancestors built the Capitol, but yet there are monuments to the very people that enslaved my ancestors,\" said Rep.

It is a way of correcting history.\"The measure now heads to the Senate. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has previously rejected efforts to \"\" and believes the decision on statues should be left up to the states, which get to send two statues each to display at the Capitol.Taking a more aggressive approach, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif,  on Juneteenth the four portraits of past House Speakers who served the confederacy and said this legislation would and four other statues honoring persons who similarly exemplified \"bigotry and hate.\"\"How can we seek to end the scourge of\u00a0racism in America we allow the worst perpetrators of that\u00a0racism to be lauded\u00a0in the halls of Congress,\" Pelosi said on the House floor. Democrats backing\u00a0the legislation said the effort is long overdue and should be no substitute for more substantial legislation to tackle systemic racism and police brutality that protesters nationwide are demanding.Critics who have panned rioters nationwide toppling and destroying statues backed his more orderly approach for removing symbols of the Confederacy.Rep. Rodney Davis, R-Ill. said Republicans and Democrats Wednesday are sending\u00a0a strong message on American values.\"The statues in the U.S. Capitol represent to visitors throughout the world what we stand for as a nation,\" Davis said.The legislation would\u00a0remove all statues of individuals \"who voluntarily served the Confederate States of America from display in the United States Capitol.\"\u00a0Among the statues expected to be targeted are\u00a0Jefferson Davis and Alexander Stephens, the former president and vice president of the Confederate states who were charged with treason against the United States.The legislation would also replace the bust of\u00a0Roger Brooke Taney in the Old Supreme Court Chamber of the Capitol with a bust of Thurgood Marshall,\u00a0who in 1967 became the first African American to serve on the Supreme Court.Taney, a Maryland native and justice from 1836 to 1864, wrote the\u00a0Dred Scott decision that found Black people were not American citizens.Rep. Tom McClintock, R-Calif., said Taney's Dred Scott decision was the \"worst decision ever rendered by the Supreme Court.\" Yet, McClintock still opposed legislation to remove his statue\u00a0and others, fearing that soon statues\u00a0will be swapped out like \"trading cards.\"\"If\u00a0we remove memorials to every person in this building who ever made a bad decision -- and his was the worst --\u00a0well, this would be a very barren place indeed...Our nation's history should be made of sterner stuff,\" McClintock said.The bill specifically calls for the removal of monuments of Taney,\u00a0Charles B.

I'm Bret Baier. Breaking tonight, President Trump says he is canceling the Jacksonville, Florida component of the Republican National Convention, the president saying just a short time ago, the business of the convention will take place in Charlotte, North Carolina, as was originally planned. We're expected to get more details about how all of that will play out in coming days. He notes the Jacksonville, Florida area is a coronavirus hot spot. The president once again defending his call for all students to return to classrooms this coming semester in that press briefing with reporters just a few -- short time ago. Senate Republicans and the administration officials have dropped the idea of a payroll tax cut from the negotiations over a new round of coronavirus aid. The Senate majority leader says he will release a framework for a new bill next week, they were hoping to do it this week. We'll talk live with the White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows about this and other topics in just a few minutes. This occurs as the U.S. passes the four million mark in infections, more than 143,000 Americans have died in this country. An associated press poll indicates three out of four Americans favor requiring people to wear masks outside of their homes. Here in the nation's capital, face coverings are now mandatory. Meantime, applications for first-time jobless benefits went up this week for the first time in months. Also breaking tonight, new Fox battleground state polls, the president trailing Joe Biden in three key battleground states, we'll bring that to you in a minute. Chief White House correspondent John Roberts starts us off though as he often does on the North Lawn. Good evening, John. JOHN ROBERTS, FOX NEWS CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Just a typical Thursday here at the White House, Bret. You'll recall that a couple of months ago, President Trump told Roy Cooper the governor of North Carolina, if he couldn't guarantee that they could have a big event in Charlotte for the big speech night at the convention, that they were going to move it. The president was happy to have it in Jacksonville he said this afternoon. His team came in with drawings of what they had put together, and he said the drawings were very compelling but the situation in Florida with the explosion in coronavirus cases, just meant that he could not go down there and have a large crowd to watch him give the acceptance speech, here's what the president said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I looked at my team and I said, the timing for this event is not right, it's just not right with what's happened recently. The flare up in Florida, to have a big convention is not the right time. It's really something that for me, I have to protect the American people. (END VIDEO CLIP) ROBERTS: So the president did not have an alternative at least at this point as to how he will give that big convention acceptance speech. It may be some sort of a virtual event, it may be something else but it's not going to be the big event that he had planned for Jacksonville. The president also as you mentioned at the top here Bret, talking about the issue of school reopening, saying that the Centers for Disease Control will in the next few hours come out with new guidelines that schools can use to decide whether or not they're going to reopen. But federal guidelines aside, this really comes down to a local and state level and on all of those levels, the debate is raging over what to do. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ROBERTS: Proponents of children going back to class point to science that shows they contract and transmit coronavirus at a far lower rate than adults. KAYLEIGH MCENANY, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: This president's been clear, we want schools to reopen. You have the CDC director saying it's a greater public health threat for schools to stay close than open. ROBERTS: Governors like Florida's Ron DeSantis trying to balance concerns about health with concerns about learning. GOV. RON DESANTIS (R-FL): In Florida, what we tell parents is look, if you're not comfortable with that, yes, you have the right to maintain distance learning, that's fine. We want to do what parent want but we have a lot of parents that think that their kids will fall behind if they're not able to get back inside the classroom. ROBERTS: A new Associated Press poll finds only eight percent of Americans say schools should reopen as usual, 14 percent would say it would be possible with minor adjustments but 46 percent say it would take major adjustments. And there is a big split between Democrats and Republicans over keeping schools closed, 44 percent of Democrats say schools should not reopen, just 14 percent of Republicans think that. On Capitol Hill, Senate Republicans say they have reached agreement on money for schools in a phase four relief package, $105 billion, about $1,200 per student. SEN. LAMAR ALEXANDER (R-TN): It's a very generous amount of money half to go to every school and the other half would go to try to encourage and help those schools that are trying to open in person. People that have -- when you have to hire extra teachers and put up barriers and buy a protective equipment, they're more expensive there. ROBERTS: Democrats who passed a $3 trillion monster phase four relief package back in May mocking their Senate colleagues for taking so long. SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY): They can't come together. Even after all this time, it appears the Republican legislative response to COVID is unified, unserious, unsatisfactory. ROBERTS: One thing that won't be in the Senate's phase four bill, a payroll tax cut. Republicans saying it won't happen but the president will still fight to eventually make it so. STEVEN MNUCHIN, U.S. TREASURY SECRETARY: Not in this but we're going to come back again. You know, there may be a CARES 5.0. The president again is focused on money and American workers and American pockets right now. ROBERTS: The relief bill aside, the White House has another coronavirus problem, a cafeteria worker at the Eisenhower Executive Office Building testing positive for the virus. The White House Medical Office has done contact tracing and determined no one else was at risk. But out of caution, the cafeteria and Ike's Eatery in the building will both close for two weeks. (END VIDEOTAPE) ROBERTS: Now, back on the president canceling the Jacksonville part of the Republican Convention. You know, during a campaign, there were really just a couple of moments -- big moments, where you can move the needle in terms of public opinion. There's the debates and then there's the convention and that big night with a speech. The present will give that up and will have to try to find a different way to move the needle, but the president saying this afternoon Bret, that setting the example is important, Bret. BAIER: John Roberts live on the North Lawn. John thanks. As we mentioned, breaking tonight at the top, we're giving you the first look tonight at new Fox polls for several battleground states. Not good news for the president in these polls, Joe Biden leads in Pennsylvania 50 to 39, the president has lost three points since April. In 2016, candidate Trump won that state by less than one percentage point. In Michigan, the margin is nine, 49 to 40, that's a one-point gain again for Biden. President Trump won that state four years ago by three-tenths of a percent. And in Minnesota, Biden is up 13 points, 51-38. Donald Trump lost that state in 2016 by 1-1/2 percent to Hillary Clinton. The two men who will be at the top of the ticket in November are spending this week arguing over racism. Joe Biden says President Trump is the first racist elected to the top job, the president says that's an affront to African-Americans and the Trump campaign is pointing back to Joe Biden's past comments. Correspondent Peter Doocy has the latest tonight. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PETER DOOCY, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Joe Biden believes 45 is a first. JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We've had racists and they've exist and they've tried to get elected president. He's the first one that has. DOOCY: President Trump's campaign says this is an insult to the intelligence of Black voters. And Trump himself is trying to add historical context. TRUMP: I've done more for Black Americans than anybody with the possible exception of Abraham Lincoln. DOOCY: 12 U.S. presidents at some point in their lives owned slaves, Woodrow Wilson name was just stripped from a school at Princeton because of his past segregationist policies. And Andrew Jackson is set to be replaced within a decade on the $20.00 bill design by Harriet Tubman after review of his record of mistreating slaves and Native Americans, but Biden insists, Trump is the first racist. BIDEN: The way he pets people against one another is all designed to divide the country, divide people. DOOCY: If there's one Biden attack on Trump that's been consistent since day one, it's this. Central theme of this announcement video was President Trump's response to deadly race riots in Charlottesville. BIDEN: He said there were, quote, some very fine people on both sides, very fine people on both sides? DOOCY: Registered voters in a new Fox News poll trust Biden over Trump in every leading issue in battleground Minnesota but Trump has more trust on the economy in battleground's Michigan and Pennsylvania. Now, Biden is hoping to hold his overall lead with help from his old boss. BARACK OBAMA, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: What kind of values are you communicating? BIDEN: Bingo. (END VIDEOTAPE) DOOCY: That's part of a 15-minute long streaming campaign video with Biden and Obama who reportedly got paid $15 million to develop streaming content for Netflix. But it appears he did this one for his former V.P. for free, Bret. BAIER: All right, Peter, thank you. Its official, one of the Portland protests that really have become nightly confrontations with law enforcement has officially now been declared a riot. That designation applies to last Saturday's event. Meantime, the Justice Department inspector general is launching a probe into law enforcement in Oregon and also federal efforts here in Washington, D.C. The situation in Portland puts into clearer focus President Trump's decision to put federal forces on the streets. Correspondent Dan Springer shows us the situation seems to be getting worse. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DAN SPRINGER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: It was one of the most violent nights yet in Portland. A new fence put up around the federal courthouse did not stem the chaos. Arsonists through Molotov cocktails and hundreds of fireworks over it, vandals cut through it. While Portland police state away, federal officers there to protect the courthouse and federal buildings repeatedly fired tear gas and deployed flash bang devices. Mayor Ted Wheeler showed up for what he called a listening session. But when he spoke, he was shouted down with obscenities, called a Nazi, spit at and told to resign. Then, while next to the fence, he was hit with tear gas, telling one reporter he saw nothing to provoke that response. After a second guessing, his security detail took him to cover in a nearby city building. It all happen the same day the city council passed a law banning Portland police from helping federal officers in any way, even in life-threatening situations. Oregon's governor joins the call for the Fed's delete. GOV. KATE BROWN (D-OR): This is a democracy, not a dictatorship. We cannot have secret police abducting people in to -- and putting them in unmarked vehicles. I cannot believe I have to say that to the president of the United States. SPRINGER: President Trump is sending federal agents to other cities not to protect federal buildings but to help solve murders and stem the tide of violent crime. Chicago will get 200 agents, Albuquerque 35. (END VIDEOTAPE) SPRINGER: The mayors of 16 cities signed a letter to President Trump saying they don't want any federal agents sent their way, among them the mayor of Seattle who battled Trump over the CHOP protest zone. And now comes word that the Seattle chapter of the Youth Liberation Front is planning a big protest here for this weekend, Bret. BAIER: Dan, thank you. Let's talk about the major issues facing this White House with a man on the inside, the inner circle, White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows. Thanks for being here. MARK MEADOWS, WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF: Great to be with you, Bret. Thanks so much. BAIER: First I want to talk about the breaking news, the president making that announcement about Jacksonville, he's -- was he disappointed? MEADOWS: Well, I think for all of us, we're disappointed that we can't have the convention but it's a responsible and really dedicated decision by the president of the United States to focus not only on the safety of those that might be attending but really on the safety of all Americans to keep focused on making sure that we combat this China virus and make sure that we have vaccines. And so, he made one of the most difficult decisions that any president or politician might have to make, which is saying that what we're going to do is put aside those partisan politics and make sure that we actually focus on what is key. And yet, it was an easy decision for him because he says we're going to put the American people first, we're going to focus on make sure that we get testing for those schools and day care centers and nursing homes done, but more importantly than that, open back our schools in a safe and responsible way. And we've been working around the clock with some of our colleagues on Capitol Hill to get that done. BAIER: Well, I want to talk about that. Where are you with that? There seem to be kind of this giant exhale upon Capitol Hill of frustration really that they couldn't get a bill out this week. Where are Republicans, where is your negotiation tonight? MEADOWS: Well, we've had a number of discussions with our Republican senators on Capitol Hill over the last couple of days, Secretary Mnuchin has done a great job in doing that. But I think the real frustration is really about trying to make sure that we focus on a couple of key components. We know that we have unemployment insurance and those who are still unemployed and receiving those benefits with that about to expire next week. We also know that we have businesses that continue to remain in unbelievably difficult circumstances. So what we're trying to do is focus on those priorities and yet, the Democrats have put together some $3 trillion. We found that they were not really serious about their effort that they put forth, so we're trying to make sure that we get the immediate needs first and then continue to negotiate perhaps throughout most of August until we get something finished. BAIER: Yes, here's how Politico wrote it this afternoon and I want to just get your reaction. MEADOWS: Sure. BAIER: Senate Republicans in the White House wasted a week at the worst possible time. Amid a series of crises with 30 million Americans unemployed, coronavirus cases spiking nationally White House officials, Senate GOP leaders couldn't even come to an agreement among themselves on a starting point for a new relief package, let alone begin bipartisan talks with Democrats. Privately, GOP lawmakers were flabbergasted that they'll likely have to wait until next week to unveil even an initial proposal. And we found out from the Senate Majority Leader that's exactly what it's going to be, a framework. Where is the sticking point? So there's a payroll tax is out, right? MEADOWS: Well, the president made that decision primarily because we knew that the Democrats saw that as an asked and something that would benefit all American wage earners. And yet, they -- because the president was asking for it, they made it clear that, that was a nonstarter for them. We did have some on the Republican side expressing concern. But instead of going all-in on that with the president, we made a decision to start focusing on not only the unemployment, insurance, but liability protection, the PPP extension, and help for schools. That $105 billion that you've already reported on. And so, where we are specifically is, is that we -- we're offering some of those things that help the people that are in most need right now. And yet, there is wish list. The $2 trillion or $3 trillion wish list that the Democrats are putting forth that are -- is just really beyond reasonable in terms of what they might consider is, is appropriate and realistic. So, I can tell you that the discussions continue on. We have line by line that we are going through that we -- we've gotten from our Republican senators, trying to make sure that it actually meets the needs of the American people. But I'm -- the president has made one thing clear. We're going to make sure that we have something there for those that are struggling the most, and that we keep this economy going, and I'm confident that we'll get there. BAIER: You know, your opponents are obviously jumping all over this. Saying, Republicans can get their act together on this, and it sends a message about November. What's your reaction to that? MEADOWS: Well, I mean -- listen, opponents on Capitol Hill, will always speak out against this president, they consistently do. When you look at a $3 trillion package that they put forth several weeks ago, not even their own members took it serious. I mean, when you look at the amount of money that they're asking for state and local health, they've actually put a number in there that equals their entire revenue for half a year. I mean, it's just -- it's not reasonable. BAIER: Yes. MEADOWS: It's not rational. And so, as we look at it, it's easy to put numbers on a piece of paper. That's what they've done, put numbers on a piece of paper. It's much more difficult to be responsible about that, because it's not our money, it's the American taxpayer's money. BAIER: You know what I hear a lot though? I hear a lot that -- you know, why can the Democrats: Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer, cracked the whip and get Democrats to fall in line, but Republicans can't when push comes to shove. And I ask you this as a former member of the House Freedom Caucus, who stood up against the number of votes that the party wanted to do. (CROSSTALK) MEADOWS: Yes. Sure. Right, well, it's really easy when you're spending someone else's money, Bret. Eventually, you run out of other people's money. We already know that and just because we're starting to talk about a trillion here or a trillion there, it doesn't make it responsible. The bill that the Democrats have put forth is not even reasonable when it comes to the needs. Even with their best estimates, they have to smile when they put forth some of the numbers. And I can tell you, we'll get to the -- to the bottom of it, we'll make sure that we do it right. The president is committed to that. BAIER: How concerned are you about polls inside the White House? We have these new state polls where the president's approval-disapproval is upside down in these three key states, Michigan, Minnesota, and Pennsylvania. Trust on the job on coronavirus, even on the economy, the edge is really, really tight. How concerned are you about all of this? MEADOWS: Listen, I don't talk about the polls, I look at policy because policy always drives the polls. When you put two things in place, the policy and the people is your number one priority, it always works out at the end. And ultimately, the only poll that counts is in November. When you look at, at what we're seeing though, is we've had a president that has not only performed before but will do it again. And the great thing is -- about all of this is, is that we actually have a president who has a track record, you know, it's not someone in a basement without one. BAIER: Yes, I want to follow up on something you told Maria Bartiromo over the weekend. And you said that the American people expect indictments in this investigation of the investigation. MEADOWS: Right. BAIER: The Durham report we haven't heard when it's coming out. If it's coming out, do you have any sense of when it's coming and what may be holding it up? MEADOWS: Well, that's under the Department of Justice. I wouldn't have any visibility in terms of a time frame with John Durham in the investigation that he is conducting. I can tell you this based on documents that I saw in my previous career, based on what I know going forward. There should be accountability, the American people expect it. And yet, at the same time, they would be extremely disappointed if people are not held accountable. This president indeed was spied on, and he was spied on by a government that shouldn't be involved in that, and those people do need to be held accountable. BAIER: We appreciate your time. Please come back and you think something will come together next week? MEADOWS: Well, we will certainly have something for the Democrats to vote on next week. And I can -- I can tell you, it's going to put the people of America and those that are suffering the most as our number one priority. BAIER: White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, thanks. MEADOWS: Thank you. BAIER: Up next, it's finally time to hear play ball for Major League Baseball. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, FORMER FOX NEWS POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: But all the glory, you know, and with the White House on fire, the Congress in chaos, and the world going to hell in a handbasket, we need happy news like this. This is why God created baseball late on the sixth day. (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: Wise words from the late great Charles Krauthammer. By the way, I was wearing the same tie that day. Our dear friend was the biggest Washington Nationals fan of all. We are just an hour away from hearing those words, play ball, for the first time, in what will be an abbreviated Major League Baseball season because of coronavirus. The first game features the defending World Series champion Washington Nationals hosting the New York Yankees. Lucas Tomlinson is at Nationals Park tonight. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) LUCAS TOMLINSON, FOX NEWS STATE DEPARTMENT PRODUCER: It's not the start Major League Baseball had in mind, but after nearly four months, baseball is back but in empty stadiums. Dr. Fauci will be throwing out the first pitch tonight at Nats Park, and while he's become somewhat of a celebrity in the fight against coronavirus, he tells Nationals' first baseman Ryan Zimmerman, he's not feeling as confident about throwing out the first pitch. DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES: And I'm quite nervous about it. Yes. RYAN ZIMMERMAN, FIRST BASEMAN, WASHINGTON NATIONALS: OK. Well, don't worry about it, if you bounce it, there's nobody there to boo you. So, you'll be good to go. You're fine. TOMLINSON: There are some new rules for the 60-game season. The National League adds a designated hitter, a runner on second base will begin extra innings, and there'll be no face-to-face arguments with umpires. Major League Baseball, also announced it will show support for the Black Lives Matter movement. Earlier this week, some San Francisco Giants players and the manager kneeled during the national anthem at an exhibition game. Nancy Pelosi praised the move. REP. NANCY PELOSI, (D-CA): I'm so proud of Gabe Kapler, our new general manager who knelt with them. TOMLINSON: Unlike the NBA and NHL, all 30 big league clubs will travel around the country over the next two months. The Nationals will play in some COVID hot spots and make a 10-game road trip in three cities which could make it challenging for any contact tracing if anyone tests positive for coronavirus. Even though stadiums will be empty, Fox Sports will be adding thousands of virtual fans in the seats during broadcast, so people at home can have a feel of a sold-out stadium. (END VIDEOTAPE) TOMLINSON: Late this afternoon, Nationals general manager Mike Rizzo, announced his star outfielder Juan Soto, tested positive of the coronavirus and is out for tonight's season opener, Bret. BAIER: All right. Lucas, thank you. We'll have to see how that virtual fan thing works. Stocks were down today because of initial jobless claims rising for the first time since March. We told you about that earlier. The Dow lost 353- 1/2. The S&P 500 dropped 40, the NASDAQ plummeted 245. Up next, the canceled culture eating its own. We'll explain. First, here is what some of our Fox affiliates around the country are covering tonight. Fox 5 in New York as a judge ordered the release from prison of former Trump personal lawyer Michael Cohen. The judge, saying he believes the government retaliated against Cohen for writing a book about President Trump. A book expected to be very negative to the president. Cohen, sued the government earlier this week, saying he was ordered back to prison on July 9th over the book issue. Fox 9 in the Twin Cities as Minnesota Democrat Governor Tim Walz, signs a police accountability bill into law. It includes a ban on neck restraints like the one used on George Floyd before his death in Minneapolis. Bill also prohibits chokeholds and so-called warrior style training, which critics say promotes excessive force. And this is a live look at Austin, Texas from our affiliate Fox 7. One of the big stories there tonight, a storm watch is in effect for the Texas coast after the formation of a tropical depression in the Gulf of Mexico. The system is expected to become Tropical Storm Hanna, Friday, before making landfall south of the Houston area. That is tonight's live look \"OUTSIDE THE BELTWAY\" from SPECIAL REPORT. We'll be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BAIER: A cautionary tale tonight for the so-called cancel culture. The arbiters of the latest fad of political correctness continue to chip away at traditional American figures, but they also are turning on members of the liberal culture from which they came. Correspondent Doug McKelway shows us this evening. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY): Mobs have dragged statues of Washington, Jefferson, and Grant through the dirt. DOUG MCKELWAY, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: While Mitch McConnell was attacking the so-called cancel culture on the Senate floor Wednesday, the House was debating whether to remove 16 statues, including the bust of Supreme Court Chief Justice Roger Taney, a Democrat and author of 1857 Dred Scott decision that denied African-Americans citizenship. REP. STENY HOYER (D-MD): What Dred Scott said was black lives did not matter. We assert that yes, they do matter. MCKELWAY: On Tuesday Planned Parenthood removed the name of its founder, Margaret Sanger, from its New York City clinic. Sanger advocated for sterilization to stop the reproduction of, quote, \"inferior people.\" BENJAMIN WATSON, FORMER NFL PLAYER: That's surprising considering what they said over the last several years about her, giving out awards in her honor and touting her as a hero. But now is a time of reckoning, as it should be. MCKELWAY: A similar cancelling for John Muir, the father of national parks. He founded the Sierra Club which announced it's ending its association with Muir, describing him as a, quote, \"white supremacist\" who drew on deeply harmful racial stereotypes. As many as 80 global and American companies, some often identified as progressive, are also facing uncomfortable pressure. Republican Senator Josh Hawley introduced a bill on Monday that would hold them accountable for what Hawley says is slave labor in their supply chains. Among those cited by Hawley, Nike, Adidas, Puma, Lenovo, Samsung, Starbucks, and Nespresso. Asked recently what she thought of cancel culture and the tearing down a Columbus statue, Speaker Pelosi said this. REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA): People will do what they do. MCKELWAY: In Pelosi's childhood home of Baltimore, a statue of Columbus was toppled and throw into the Inner Harbor this month. Statues of Confederate Generals Robert E. Lee and Stonewall Jackson were taken down two years ago after Charlottesville. They had been dedicated in 1948 by her father, Mayor Thomas D'Alesandro, who said that the statues, quote, \"remind us to be resolute in preserving our sacred institutions.\" (END VIDEOTAPE) MCKELWAY: On Wednesday, the House voted to remove all 16 statues, but 113 members, all Republicans, voted against it, and it's doubtful the Senate will take up anything similar. Bret? BAIER: Doug McKelway up on the Hill. Doug, thanks. The main focus tonight in legal proceedings against a woman accused of helping late financier and pedophile Jeffrey Epstein recruit underaged girls appears to be what information becomes public now. Correspondent Laura Ingle looks at the latest decisions. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) LAURA INGLE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: The documents in question date back to a civil defamation case filed against Ghislaine Maxwell by Jeffrey Epstein accuser Virginia Giuffre. The case was settled and the documents sealed. Many have since been unsealed, like ones that detailed Giuffre's accusations that Maxwell made her have sex with Prince Andrew at age 17. Giuffre is fighting to release more. Maxwell is fighting to stop it, citing potential embarrassment. The judge ruling against her, saying, quote, \"any minor embarrassment or annoyance resulting from disclosure of Ms. Maxwell's mostly non-testimony about behavior that has been widely reported in the press is far outweighed by the presumption of public access.\" The judge deciding to release thousands more pages, including the transcript of Maxwell's seven-hour long deposition, and why she is facing perjury charges today. The judge ruled nearly all the remaining documents should be released, but the names of certain John Doe's not yet made public should remain redacted. A name once known to run in Maxwell's circles is President Trump, something he admitted this week. TRUMP: I've met her numerous times over the years, especially since I lived in Palm Beach, and I guess they lived in Palm Beach. But I wish her well. INGLE: But as Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany points out, President Trump banned Jeffrey Epstein from Mar-a-Lago long ago. KAYLEIGH MCENANY, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: This president was always on top of this, ahead of this, noting this, banning this man from his property long before this case was even played out in a court of law. (END VIDEOTAPE) INGLE: Despite the judge's ruling to release these long awaited and potentially explosive documents, there will be nothing to read for at least a week while Maxwell's lawyers file an appeal. Bret? BAIER: We'll follow it. Laura, thank you. New York Democratic Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez used some shocking language today on the House floor because she was quoting what a Republican colleague said to her. Her comments come following a verbal exchange with Florida Republican Ted Yoho Monday in which he used the profane sexist slur that the congresswoman repeated in her speech. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. ALEXANDRA OCASIO-CORTEZ, (D-NY): In front of reporters, Representative Yoho called me, and I quote, a -- These are the words that Representative Yoho levied against a congresswoman. (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: We added the beep. Yoho has apologized for what he called his, quote, abrupt manner. Ocasio-Cortez did not accept that apology. When we come back, will President Trump withdraw all U.S. forces from Afghanistan? (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BAIER: Witnesses in Afghanistan say a government air strike killed at least 14 people, many of them women and children. It happened as hundreds of them gathered to welcome a former Taliban fighter freed from jail. The U.S. peace envoy to Afghanistan tweeted a condemnation of the strike, welcoming a government investigation. One of President Trump's campaign promises from 2016 was to end what he called America's involvement in endless wars. It's a message he continues to deliver to this day. But is that strategy working? Here is national security correspondent Jennifer Griffin. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JENNIFER GRIFFIN, FOX NEWS NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: A peace deal with the Taliban the Trump administration hopes will allow U.S. troops to come home after 19 years of war, past the 135 day mark this week. But the agreement, signed in February, remains fragile. CENTCOM Commander General Frank McKenzie had this warning in an interview with \"Voice of America.\" GEN. KENNETH F. MCKENZIE, CENTCOM COMMANDER: And while the Taliban have been scrupulous about not attacking U.S. or coalition forces. In fact, the violence against the Afghans is higher than it has been in quite a while. GRIFFIN: The U.S.-Taliban deal calls for a full U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan within 14 months, something the president campaigned on and hopes to achieve by November. TRUMP: We want to bring our people back home. GRIFFIN: Since February, the U.S. has drawn down to 8,600 troops and withdrawn from five bases in Afghanistan as part of the deal, roughly the same number of troops as when President Obama left office, down from a high of 100,000 in 2010. No U.S. troops have been killed in Afghanistan since the deal was signed. The Pentagon continues to say it has found no evidence the Russians paid bounties that led to the death of any American troops. JONATHAN HOFFMAN, CHIEF PENTAGON SPOKESPERSON: We've not found any corroborating evidence that would indicate that there was a bounty program. GRIFFIN: Secretary of State Mike Pompeo spoke to his Russian counterpart about working together in Afghanistan. MIKE POMPEO, SECRETARY OF STATE: We think it's in Russia's best interest. We think it's in China's best interest. We know it's in the Afghan people's best interest. (END VIDEOTAPE) GRIFFIN: The House version of the National Defense Authorization Act includes an amendment from Democrat Jason Crow of Colorado and Liz Cheney of Wyoming that would require the administration to make several certifications to Congress before it can draw down any further in Afghanistan. Bret? BAIER: Jennifer Griffin at the Pentagon. Jennifer, thank you. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told an audience at the Nixon Library in California the U.S. ordered Beijing to close its consulate in Houston because it was a hub of spying and intellectual property theft. Tonight on \"The Story\" with Martha MacCallum, Pompeo talks at length about the deteriorating U.S. relationship with China. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) POMPEO: When you see what the Chinese Communist Party has done to our country and to the world with their failure to live up to another set of promises that they made to the world about their responsibility if a pandemic began to break out in their country, the cover-up that took place, you can absently understand why a trade deal like the phase one trade deal no longer ranks first of all the various issues we have with the Chinese Communist Party. (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: Secretary Pompeo, you can see that interview with Martha at the top of the hour. The U.S. is accusing Russia of conducting a test of antisatellite weapons in space, saying it's Moscow's intent to deploy weapons that threaten U.S. and allied satellites. The head of the British space agency agreed, writing on Twitter Russia launched a projectile with characteristics of a weapon. Russia says the event was an inspection of a satellite using special equipment. Next up, the panel with reaction to today's presidential news conference and the cancellation of Jacksonville as the RNC convention, plus my interview with the White House chief of staff. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: I looked at my team and I said the timing for this event is not right. It's just not right, with what has happened recently, the flare up in Florida, to have a big convention. It's not the right time. It's really something that for me, I have to protect the American people. (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: President Trump canceling the Jacksonville, Florida, part of the convention. If you remember, it was eight weeks ago he moved from Charlotte, North Carolina, because of too strict health situation, he wanted to have a bigger party atmosphere. But within eight weeks, the spike in Florida changed this, and he has canceled that, so now making plans for a very different Republican convention. This as some new key battleground state polls come out tonight. FOX polls Michigan, Minnesota, Pennsylvania, and you can see Joe Biden leading in all of those, various numbers there. The president's job performance upside- down, underwater in all three states, Michigan, Minnesota, and Pennsylvania. And then this is probably the biggest spread, trust to do a better job on coronavirus in those three states, 19, 23, and 18 points difference in our latest FOX News poll. Let's bring in our panel, Matthew Continetti, founding editor of the \"Washington Free Beacon,\" Julie Pace, Washington Bureau Chief for the Associated Press, and Jason Riley, \"Wall Street Journal\" columnist and senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute. Julie, you're at the White House, pay attention to all that stuff day-to-day, quite a turnaround, and obviously the situation in Florida changed the dynamic completely. JULIE PACE, WASHINGTON BUREAU CHIEF, ASSOCIATED PRESS: Absolutely. I think this is the president bending to reality here and really recognizing that, whether he likes it or not, this is an election that is very much going to be decided on how Americans view his handling of the pandemic. And he can't wish it away. He is the commander-in-chief and he is ultimately responsible for the health and safety of Americans. And so there was this huge contradiction between him planning to move forward with a big convention, with hundreds of people, thousands of people jammed into a space, and then his administration advising Americans to avoid those exact kind of situations. And so I think ultimately it just became untenable for him to move forward with a traditional convention. BAIER: Matthew, the White House chief of staff, Mark Meadows, saying that it's a very tough decision for a politician. Obviously, it's a launching point for the campaign. But he said it was an easy decision that happened quickly for President Trump when he faced the dangers of what Jacksonville may look like. MATTHEW CONTINETTI, EDITOR IN CHIEF, \"WASHINGTON FREE BEACON\": Look, I think it was a concession to reality. I also think it's a signal of Trump's new tone that he's trying to communicate that he's taking the virus seriously. It also frees him up, I think, to give a more creative address to the nation. But it also says to me, Bret, that this election will really depend more so than usual on the debates. Those will really be one or three instances where we have both candidates in a traditional setting up against each other. The conventions don't matter as much, there's no campaign trail rallies. It will come down, I think, to the debates. BAIER: Jason, take a listen to the Senate minority leader and the Senate minority leader on these negotiations about the next stimulus bill. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY): Even after all this time, it appears the Republican legislative response to COVID is ununified, unserious, unsatisfactory. MCCONNELL: Our proposal will not waste the American people's time with go- nowhere socialist fantasies. We aren't choreographing political stunts or teeing up the same old partisan trench warfare. Our proposal will focus on three things -- kids, jobs, and health care. (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: Senator McConnell saying they will have a framework of a bill. And you heard the White House chief of staff saying there is disagreement within the GOP, and they are giving Democrats the opportunity to hammer them on this issue at least in the short term. JASON RILEY, \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\" COLUMNIST: Yes, that's what we're hearing, Bret. I think that the Republicans have this right. We've had the previous stimulus packages. I think they can only do so much. There's going to be diminishing returns in terms of what the government is trying to do. We've got to get people back to work, and we can't disincentivize them to get back to work. We also have to get kids back to school in order for people to go back to work. Those two things cannot be divorced from one another. So I would like to see a bill that acknowledges that we do need to get this economy up and running again, and puts safety first, obviously, but also weigh the health costs and the financial costs of this lockdown. BAIER: Julie, A.P. poll on school reopening K through 12 schools, open as usual, eight percent, minor adjustments, 14 percent, major adjustments 46 percent. A lot of focus today on the open as usual being only eight percent, but if you add it all up, you're at 68 percent that want it open somehow, schools. So this is going to be a big issue. PACE: It absolutely is. The majority, as you cite in our poll there, wants schools to open. But most people do want to see some kind of adjustments. And I think that's where the struggle is very real for a lot of school districts and a lot of parents. What are those adjustments? What is feasible? What allows you to send a child back in a way that allows them to both be safe and have a productive learning atmosphere right now. And I think the reality that we're seeing from a lot of major school districts in a lot of parts of the country is that they just don't think that they can get there and make those kinds of decisions in the next couple of weeks. And so they are trying to put this decision off until probably the beginning of 2021, which leaves a lot of people in a really tough spot, certainly, for the next couple months. BAIER: I know, in limbo. It's tough. Matthew, very quickly, you think these tighter news conferences, these briefings are helping the president? CONTINETTI: Well, I hope we'll see that emerge in the polls, Bret. But the key is right now, Trump is not running against Biden. He's running against the coronavirus. And in order to win in November, he has to lead on the coronavirus. BAIER: All right, panel, as always, thank you. When we come back, the brighter side of things, some good news. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BAIER: Finally tonight, a pair of special surprises. Joanna Lauby thought she was doing a photo shoot with her two-year-old daughter Annelise. Little did she know her husband Nate turned it into a surprise reunion. Nate's an Army Reserve staff sergeant. He's been deployed overseas since July. Came home early. That's a happy day. When Cameron Andrade returned home after a seven-month deployment with the U.S. Navy, his wife was not the only one happy to see him. Check this out. Cameron's dog Brody could not contain his excitement outside their home in Connecticut. That dog knew. He wagged his tail, ran around furiously. Welcome home Cameron and Nate, thank you for your service. Thanks for inviting us into your home tonight. That's it for this SPECIAL REPORT.

I'm Greg Gutfeld, with Jesse Watters, Juan Williams, Dana Perino, and Kennedy, THE FIVE. A hundred liberal rioters signed an open letter in Harper's condemning cancel culture as an attack on free thought, to which I say better late than never. A wise man once said every good deed could've been done sooner so I applaud them for joining the fight, finally. Even though some of them, they didn't seem to mind cancel culture when it takes aim at people like you or me. In fact, some of them did take aim at me, and maybe you. But now, it's targeting them and they could lose a book deal, hence the letter. It's the old adage that liberals should have learned by now. You can be nice to a crocodile but he will still eat you, albeit last. So the open letter is cute, but why not actively defend people who are being cancelled right now, who aren't part of this elite group that signed the letter? Why not help those who've lost their jobs and not just speaking engagements? Instead, they say they want end cancel culture because its existence will help Trump. No, you should want to end it because you helped create it. It rose from the toxic mud of academia, energized by the cowardice of liberals and media politics and business. The cancellers can smell their fear. So if you say something that they don't like, they will contact your workplace and hound your bosses online until you're finally fired. The First Amendment matters little if they can still ruin your career and life. Yesterday, I asked, where is the silent majority? The answer, in hiding from an unstable, angry mob. These open letter warriors should fight for them, not just for themselves. The people who make a stupid mistake and lose their jobs, they don't have rich friends. I mean, we could win this thing if we fight this thing together. But do it alone, you lose. So Kennedy, I actually loved the letter. I mean, it's kind of bland. I love it. But there's part of me that's bothered by the fact that they are doing it now because they finally feel the heat that other people have felt. LISA KENNEDY MONTGOMERY, FOX NEWS HOST: I was wondering when this was going to happen. I was wondering when we were going to arrive at the point where rabid ultra-leftists would wake up and be reasonable for a second, because cancel culture, it knows no bounds. It knows no party. And it's a very, very hungry beast. And as we have seen, it does nothing because there is no end game. If you have a list of demands that you think you're going to meet and end the outrage, that's never going to happen. They will come up with new items on that list. They will come up with new lists and new enemies. And guess what, it doesn't matter if you are one of the coastal elites. They are coming for you. So it's about damn time that someone, as a group, stood up for free speech, especially that which you disagree with most. GUTFELD: Yeah. Now, Juan, if they had asked you to sign this letter, would you have? JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS HOST: I'm not sure. I think so. But I mean, you know, I resist sort of joining in any kind of club like that. And you saw it in terms of the response from some on the far left. You said, hey, these are been with high-paying jobs who are just worried about losing their next speech. You know, they are not speaking out for everyone. But Greg, I agree for the most part because, you know, you know, I have been fired for speaking my mind, right? So I have lost a job because of this. I literally wrote a book called Muzzle, the Assault on Honest Debate about this. You know, what's ironic and what troubles me, and the reason I would've hesitated is I think that ideological debate today is more open than it's ever been, in large part because no matter -- what your voice carries. There is a social media platform for you today. Those voices are going to get heard more so than ever before. And I think that's a good thing. You know, people talk about cancel culture. But, you know, it plays, just as Kennedy says, it plays on the left. It plays on the right. President Trump just recently, he's trying to block a book by his knees. He's trying to block Bolton's book. You know, he tried to -- (CROSSTALK) GUTFELD: That's not cancel culture, Juan. (CROSSTALK) WILLIAMS: I think it is. (CROSSTALK) WILLIAMS: -- you're trying to shut somebody up -- I think if you're trying to shut people up. (CROSSTALK) GUTFELD: Yeah, I know. We have a delay. WILLIAMS: OK. GUTFELD: Cancelling -- cancel culture targets people's careers and tries to ruin them. Now, we are not talking about a person writing a tell-all book. We are talking about obscure people who make a mistake and then their entire lives are destroyed. In this case, there is a group of people saying we have had enough. And granted, you know, they can -- you know, they might be immune to it, but maybe they are supposed to be the right people to do it at this time. DANA PERINO, FOX NEWS HOST: Yeah, right. WILLIAMS: No. So what I think is if you try to tell somebody you can't write this book. I don't want to hear what you have to say. If you say to a critic, oh, I think you're a murderer, like he said about Joe Scarborough. I think that's cancel culture. It's an attempt to shut somebody up, to muzzle them. GUTFELD: See -- WILLIAMS: So from my mind -- GUTFELD: I disagree, but we've got to move on. WILLIAMS: Let me finish my point. I think that you can't use this to excuse people who would spread lies, who would have calls to violence, conspiracy theories, racism, anti-Semitism, sexism, gay-bashing. That's not what we are talking about here. Let's talk about honest debate. GUTFELD: All right. Jesse, you can comment on what Juan just said that he kind of pushes cancel culture out to encapsulate a whole bunch of things. What say you? You are probably the prime target for cancellation at any time, probably by the people who wrote this open letter. JESSE WATTERS, FOX NEWS HOST: Yeah. If there was a betting pool on who's going to get cancelled off this show, I'd probably be winning. But yeah, no, I agree with your monologue. This was about self-preservation. It wasn't about principles. There was crickets when Republicans were getting scalped left and right. I mean, these people created the mob. The mob turned on them. And now, they are trying to change the rules in the middle of it to protect their own hide. It reminds me of one of your other monologues when you highlighted the guy who was cheering on the rioters until the rioters came to his neighborhood and burned his neighborhood down, and then he was on the phone with 911 saying where are you. But they do this in the middle of the game to protect their power, and they do this a lot. Like, they will create a movement and then drop it when it's politically expedient. Like, they did it with CHAZ. They did it with black face, with masks. They've done it with the MeToo movement. They've done it with the de-fund the police movement. And it's interesting to watch, because the left is always on offense when it comes to the culture war. The right is always on defense. And trust me. Defense does not win championships, because it's a death by 1,000 cuts. They're going to throw litigation. They're going to get you fired. They're going to have legislation. I mean, it's just a full out assault. And all of a sudden, Trump comes along and he picks up a sword and says let's go on offense, guys. And he starts going after the media. He starts going after the deep state and the anti-Christmas people and the statue topplers. And what does the Republican Party do? They not only don't grab a sword, they don't even pick up a shield and defend. They just go silent and they've just sat there this whole time. And they haven't even participated in the culture war. And that is no way to win this thing. GUTFELD: Yeah, good point. You know, Dana, I got a lot of viewers ticked off at me when I was talking about whether the silent majority existed. And I got a lot of emails from people saying, what would you have us do? If we aren't silent, we will probably lose our jobs. I think they are referring to if they talk about supporting Trump or wearing a red hat or criticizing a movement like black lives matter, that they are gone. PERINO: Yeah. And I understood your point. And I think that, of course, they are polite and they send you an email and they say, but what about us? And I think that you understand them as well, because you've said on this show before we are super privileged to be here on THE FIVE. We have a place where we are free to say whatever we want. We have bosses that back us up, like, free-speech absolutists. So we are in a much better position than a lot of people because you do see that the consequences of speaking up are not just -- maybe you had a bad couple weeks. It's that you actually lose your ability to feed your family. So when -- I agree with Juan that there has never been a time when you could express your feelings more openly and have a debate. But what's different now is that you have a situation where people will then call up your employer and demanded that you be fired. And then it's very hard for anybody to get a job after that. Remember the Mozilla CEO? Because he had given $1,000 to prop eight, which was the anti-gay marriage rule referendum in California, but that was at the same time Barack Obama expressly. That was his position at the time. And everybody reached back and got him. This past week, Boeing had an executive who lost his job for an article that he wrote 30 years ago about women in combat. GUTFELD: Right. PERINO: And if you went back 30 years ago and then you looked at the Gallup poll, I'm almost guaranteeing you would find that issue about 75-25 in the country agreeing with him. So he actually lost his position. Boeing lost an executive. His family now is out there. The safest place to be when there's a mob is in the mob. I think that this letter is a welcome thing. We should want to play red rover, red rover with them, like link arms. OK, let's do it. My last point is there was an author -- I don't know if she signed this letter. But the woman who wrote American Dirt, it was a -- I thought it was a fantastic novel that came out in January. And they cancelled her book tour, not because her book said that illegal immigrants shouldn't come to the country. No, her book was very sympathetic and empathetic to the plight of illegal immigrants and what they go through. The problem that the cancellers had with her was that she wasn't Latina enough. She was like part Latina, so they cancelled her book tour. They basically tried to run her off the road. So I think if these people that are authors and writers. If they think, wow, this has gone too far. We should take them up on it and all work together and do what you have talked about before, which is share the risk together. GUTFELD: I agree with myself as well, Dana. We should share the risk. Coming up, radical Democrat Ilhan Omar calls for dismantling America's economy and political system. What a surprise. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) WATTERS: Congresswoman Ilhan Omar proposing a very radical remaking of America. Look at this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. ILHAN OMAR (D-MN): As long as our economy and political systems prioritize profit without considering who is profiting, who is being shut out, we will perpetuate this inequality. We must begin the work of dismantling the whole system of oppression wherever we find it. (END VIDEO CLIP) WATTERS: Other members of The Squad introducing a bill that would de-fund the police, eliminate ICE, and establish reparations for people hurt by the criminal justice system, and as Joe Biden coming around to supporting calls to slash police budgets. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: The federal government's right to go in and change systemically what's going on. There's a whole range of things that we can do. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We agree that we can redirect some of the funding. BIDEN: Yes, absolutely. (END VIDEO CLIP) WATTERS: OK. So Biden's for de-funding the police. Now, Dana, I'm going to go back to the analogy. You do not dismantle something that you love. PERINO: That's true. That's a good analogy. Is that an analogy? (CROSSTALK) PERINO: But I agree with you on that. OK, so a couple things on this. One, for some reason, de-fund the police doesn't seem to mean de-fund the police in Democratic circles. Redirecting or reforming the police is apparently what they mean by that but they can't say that. They have to say have to say de-fund the police, so no wonder people are a little confused. I did note that Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez did not join these three congresswomen, the usual squad. And I think partly that's because she sees a future for herself. And she knows that it is just too far left to take that position. But Biden is going to have to continue to deal with this. The last thing I would say is that you -- I had an opportunity to travel all around the world. And, you know, I believe that you could go anywhere and you ask people. Where would you most like to live in the world? And the answer is the United States of America. And the reason is because of our system. It doesn't mean we are perfect. It doesn't mean that we constantly aren't trying to improve and to provide more opportunity and economic mobility. But I guarantee you. We are still the number one place that everybody would like to be. WATTERS: Greg, didn't America rescue Ilhan Omar from some pretty brutal circumstances in her country? And now, she's a Congresswoman. And she is funneling a lot of money to her family through her consulting business with her husband. PERINO: Yeah. GUTFELD: Yeah. She just funneled $900,000 to her new husband's political company. So basically, she is kind of paying herself. But I get it, because we always knew that she likes to keep things in the family. And it proves that anybody can be corrupt, not just old white men, right? And that -- she's, you know, she's as corrupt as they come. And by the way, I'm not confused by this. When someone tells you what they want, why not accept it? For so long, we are told when the leftists say de-fund or dismantle, they really don't mean it. Omar and BLM are telling you explicitly what they want. And it's not our system. Remember when it was considered, like, evil to question Omar's patriotism? How does that look now, as she believes that America is the most oppressive evil in the United States? While, like you point out, she abuses it. She abuses the system. It's amazing -- she got rich. She gained power. She spreads her wealth around. And all of this is just in order for her to destroy the country that gave her these opportunities. Of course, what's next is she'll claim she's the target of violence, because people actually heard what she said, right? Oh, now they are pouncing on me. But this is the vulnerability of a free country. Our immune system can be penetrated by those who wish to destroy it. But at least she's honest about it, which I give her credit for. WATTERS: Yeah. Juan, do you think it's a legitimate question to question Omar's patriotism when she says things like this? WILLIAMS: Not at all. I think it's really wrong. You know, Jesse, we live in a populist age. And that goes for people on the -- because I don't think that there's any question about her patriotism. I think she's a member of Congress and has pledged her loyalty to the United States of America and is glad to be here. But I was just going to say to you -- (CROSSTALK) WILLIAMS: -- age on the le left -- no, dismantle the capitalist. She said that she thinks it's unfair. And guess who says much the same thing? Donald Trump, he says you know what, the system is rigged. It's unfair to the workers. It's unfair to you if you're trying to pay the doctor's bill and pay for your kid to go to school. These elites aren't looking out for you. Gee, that sounds a lot like what Ilhan Omar just said. And so I -- (CROSSTALK) WILLIAMS: -- from left and right. WATTERS: OK. WILLIAMS: Of course, he said it. And you know, look, he says, you know, his solution. We should do away with these trade deals. Bring jobs back home. That sounds like her and Bernie Sanders. And one last point, there was a -- (CROSSTALK) WILLIAMS: -- about de-fund the police when people are asked, Americans, left and right, are asked about de-fund the police. Overwhelmingly, they say that is about reform the police, not take away the police. MONTGOMERY: All right. Tell that to The Squad. All right, first of all, she does hate America, because America is the system, whether you like it or not. If you're a socialist and you want to help people and lift them out of extreme poverty, then you should embrace a free market economy. And if you think that a system that only helps the few happens in America, try looking at Soviet Russia. Try looking at Zimbabwe. Try looking at Venezuela or even Sweden in the early 1980s when they were not a market economy. When they became a free market economy, then they can have a bigger welfare state, when they actually had a lot of people employed. She despises the system. She doesn't want to improve the system. And these kinds of structuralists want to undo what is great, not only about America but what America has spread throughout the world. And this system is about two things, creativity and sharing the risk. If you are willing to risk your capital and risk your future on a creative endeavor, then you get to participate fully in the American dream, which she is also doing. And you pointed that out, Jesse, and that makes her a total hypocrite. WATTERS: OK. Coming up next, President Trump accusing Democrats of playing politics over wanting to reopen schools, what he is threatening to do now, next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) WILLIAMS: The (AUDIO GAP) turning political. President Trump accusing Democrats of wanting to keep schools closed to help their chances in November. And now, he's threatening to cut funding to states that don't send students back to classrooms. And the CDC will soon be updating guidance on reopening schools. Dana, let me start with you. I think no matter what the politicians have to say, unless parents feel it safe for their kids to go back, they're not going to send them back to the schools. What do you think? PERINO: Yeah, I -- like with masks. I really don't want this discussion to end up being political. Parents obviously want their kids to go back to school. We, as Americans and taxpayers, we need our kids back in school. We want them to learn. We want them to socialize. We want them to have all that they get from a school environment. And parents, especially -- single parents imagine trying to work and not know whether your kids are going to be able to go to school. I mean, it's just incredibly complex. And I don't think that (AUDIO GAP) -- however, you saw today (AUDIO GAP) that the White House and the president saying we (AUDIO GAP) union. I just don't know if the best thing to do is say we're going to cut off your funding when all of the school districts are saying we would like to reopen. But we're trying to figure out a way to do the distancing. We have to have fewer students in the classrooms. We need more money. It just seems to me, like, a really missed opportunity to try to bring people together and get things done in a good way. And I'm afraid that this is going to turn a lot more political when what we really need is just for parents to feel comfortable. Teachers to feel comfortable, kids to be able to have the experiences that they absolutely, desperately need to have so that their futures can be assured. You've already had the missed school in the spring semester. Basically, like, write that one off. You think about the summer slide, like, how you forgot to do algebra in June and July and August. You went back in September. And teachers had to spend three weeks re- teaching you what they did last September. Think about how far behind they are. And that is a real concern for parents all across the country. WILLIAMS: Jesse, do you think it's a good political strategy to insist that schools be opened when we don't know, you know, where the virus will be in terms of the spread come, you know, late August, September. WATTERS: If kids don't go back to school in the fall, moms are going to start popping pills, Juan. Dads too. Don't send me e-mails, but I think parents have totally had it with this stuff. And like my children have fallen so behind, they're never getting into a good college. At this point, I'm going to have to practically donate a building to get them in anywhere any good and I'm probably not going to be able to afford that because I'm going to get canceled by the time they're in college anyway, so it's an absolute mess. I think honestly, just crack a window, put a mask on, and spray your desk down, and separate it. Not every school district is in Manhattan with a million students crammed into really tight classrooms with a lot of dust. I mean, most school districts are pretty spacious and wide open and not seeing a lot of COVID-19. And the CDC director said kids aren't really transmitting COVID-19. And out of 130,000 people that have died in the United States from COVID-19, only 29 of them have been children. So if Biden wants to run on opening borders and closing schools, that may swing some suburban females back into Trump's camp. WILLIAMS: Greg, just picking up on an earlier point. Why threaten the funding if this decision really is about, you know, local and state governments? GUTFELD: I can go both ways. If it's about state government maybe there shouldn't be any funding. I don't know. But when this started out, OK, let's go back four or five months, this was a -- this was a unified battle. We were all in this together. We were all coming together to flatten the curve. Who politicized it? It was the Democrats blocking the bills, the funding. Then they started to lionize Governor Cuomo to help people ignore the fact that all these people were dying in rest homes. Then they bashed hydroxychloroquine because Trump was for it. Then -- now, they blame Trump for mass death. They have been politicizing this from day one while Trump was trying to fight this as an American war. He said this was a war. He wanted us to be unified. The only reason why I think the Democrats are politicizing this is because of 130,000 deaths in the United States, 94,000 of them are in Democrat-led states, 35,000 are in Republican states. The death rate per 1,000 people is double, nearly double, not quite double but nearly double in Democrat versus Republican states. So they have to politicize it or else they'll be exposed for their fallibility. WILLIAMS: Kennedy, the president disagreed with the CDC guidelines for reopening. Now, the CDC says they're going to redo it. What do you think? MONTGOMERY: I think as a mom, I've got two kids in New York City schools, and it's really tough because we're getting so much conflicting information. And it's hard because they're -- they need time to study the virus. They need time to come up with a full picture. And so, when you just sought abstract information from here or there, if you're really paranoid, you never want to want to send your kid back to school. If you really want to work and you believe in freedom, then you at least want to give it a shot. And as a mom, I have to say, it sucks. Because yes, we don't want to leave our kids at home alone. It is not a sustainable system. But also, you don't want to send them into these petri dishes where they could go get sick, bring home germs, and infect vulnerable family members. I don't think we're there yet, but I agree with Jesse that this is not a one size fits all solution. And Thomas Massie, the great congressman from Kentucky has put up a bill several times to essentially defund the Department of Education, because top-down education, it doesn't work. Give parents more choices and let's have solutions that are you know, geographic and local and not just a political mudslinging fight. PERINO: Right. WILLIAMS: Thanks, mom. Kanye West making waves again after announcing his bid for president. Stay with us to hear what he's now saying about Donald Trump and Joe Biden, next on THE FIVE. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) MONTGOMERY: Kanye West giving a very interesting interview on his run for president. Yes, you have another choice in the race. The rapper breaking with President Trump saying he's taking his red hat off, but that doesn't mean he has any love for Joe Biden and the Democrats saying, \"A lot of times just like political parties, they feel all blacks have to be Democrat. This man Joe Biden said, if you don't vote for me, then you are not black. Well, act like we didn't hear that. We act like we didn't hear that man say that. That man said that.\" He sure did. Juan Williams and it didn't sit well with a lot of voters. What do you have to say about that? WILLIAMS: Well, obviously didn't bother nine out of 10 black voters who are still voting for Biden. But you know, you can't discount these popular culture figures, Kennedy. After President Trump's victory, I think the door is open. Now, I must say there are rules. And Kanye, I think Dana pointed this out last time we discussed it, he's missed filing deadlines in like five states. So that puts him at a tremendous Electoral College disadvantage if he's actually going to go out there and run. And I think -- I read this interview, his thing against vaccinations, calling it you know, beastly and the like, I mean, what happened? Polio has he forgotten? I mean, I think that's a real negative. Now, he does say in the interview, that the government should be run like Wakanda. Well, it might be good. I don't know. It might be better than the one we have, but it's all fantasy to me. MONTGOMERY: From Black Panther. That is an uplifting image. Yes. And -- but you know, I have to say, I like that he's getting in there mixing things up and talking about things and ways that no one else's because the two-party system gets so stale, Jesse. He also said that Joe Biden is not special. Is Joe Biden special, Jesse? WATTERS: Yes, no, it's so true. He's not special. I just can't believe Juan is actually saying that Kanye West has missed some filing deadline. OK, where are we right now? I don't think he's going to make those deadlines, Juan. But I will tell you this. I think if you're a Democrat and you feel disenfranchised, that you should write in Kanye West's name on the ballot this November. If you live in Philadelphia, Milwaukee, or Detroit, and you're feeling Kanye, you should write his name in because, hey, Kanye is Kanye. And maybe he didn't take the red hat off, maybe he just throw it in the closet for a second, but I'm feeling pretty good about a Kanye write-in situation. MONTGOMERY: Or Greg, maybe he's working with President Trump. Maybe they're in cahoots. GUTFELD: He could be. MONTGOMERY: And the President has advised him to get into the race to siphon off some critical votes from Joe Biden. GUTFELD: He could decide the election if he chooses to. The most important thing he said in the interview is that he doesn't mind if he takes black votes from the Democrats, which then helps Trump because he said -- because he said, I think I'm quoting him, that the black -- saying that the black vote is Democratic is a form of racism and white supremacy. And this goes back to what I said yesterday. He's creating a voting bloc, independent of parties to get both sides to vie for that block. Remember, the Democrats don't have to vie -- they don't think they have to vie for blacks. Republicans try to vie every single election and they don't do that well. He has to run as a Democrat in order to get the Democrats to pay attention to him or they're going to lose. MONTGOMERY: I don't know. Dana, how do you see this race shaping up with the -- my 11-year-old? You know her. She asked me the other day. She's like, mommy, are you voting for Kanye? So, I don't know what to do right now. PERINO: Look, you know, celebrity and fame gives you an opportunity to be able to have a platform of which he does. I will say, in Juan's defense, I'm the one who brought up that he had missed the filing deadlines. And that is just a fact that he -- that he has. The write-in is certainly a possibility. I do question the judgment of giving this first interview to Forbes. Obviously, that interview should have gone to the \"DAILY BRIEFING\" and we'll be happy to have him anytime. MONTGOMERY: Well, you know what? Tomorrow we'll see what happens because those follow ups, they're coming fast and furious, like the \"FASTEST SEVEN,\" which is up next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) PERINO: Welcome back. It's time for the \"FASTEST SEVEN.\" And first up, ever wonder what the key difference is between older and younger generations? This viral video says it's all in how you hold a phone. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Pretend you're talking on the phone. What would be your hand gesture? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: This? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes. Pretend you're talking on the phone. What would be your hand gesture? Yes. (END VIDEO CLIP) PERINO: All right, I know. Kennedy, this is going to be something that's going on in your house right now. MONTGOMERY: It's amazing, because my kids don't know what this means, when you're telling someone to hang up the phone. If I did that to them, they're like, no, no Shaka, mom. It's so perfect. I love it so much. And you know, I don't know how they hang up the phone though, do they? PERINO: I don't think -- Greg, I don't think you hang up the phone anymore. I think you end a call. GUTFELD: That is true. You know what, a lot -- a lot of kids don't understand anything like crank calls. You don't crank calls. I remember how excited my sister and I were when we got an extension cord, an extension line for the phone so we could drag the phone to our separate rooms. And there'd be cords all over the floor. And there'd always be food stuck in the dial of the phone because we're always eating crap. I also miss clever answering machine messages from people who think they're funny. Remember that? PERINO: Oh, yes, I love that. Jesse, apparently also kids don't know the word, rewind. They -- like you know, rewinding like a tape. They think you just go back so you got to teach them. WATTERS: Yes. They -- I have a generation gap hiccup situation too with the twins. So, if I'm ever talking or doing something and they want me to stop, you know what they say? They say pause. Like I'm like a T.V. show or a YouTube video. They say pause dad. Like they're pointing a remote at me. I'm like, what is that? PERINO: Juan, anything like this happening around you and the grandkids? WILLIAMS: You know what bothers me is when people are walking down the street, Dana, and they have the earbuds in and they're talking. And I think either talking to me, or I think they're kind of crazy and talking to themselves. But that's -- young people do it all the time. I just -- I don't like it. I just find it odd. Social -- anti-social is what I think. PERINO: The best thing to do, Juan, is just don't think anyone is talking to you, and just keep on walking. Keep on walking. WILLIAMS: OK. Just keep moving. PERINO: All right. Next up, the Coronavirus taking the fun out of riding roller coasters in Japan. Theme parks there now banning any screaming on those rides. And Kennedy, what they said is that you're supposed to scream in your heart. MONTGOMERY: I know -- I know TikTok is about to be canceled or whatever, but I see this as a TikTok challenge. When theme parks finally open here, I challenge people to try and go on Tower of Terror at Disney and try to not scream. It's impossible. PERINO: Jesse, could you -- could you go on a roller coaster and not scream? WATTERS: I think three of us here. Well, you and Greg couldn't get on the roller coaster because you're too short, but I couldn't go on the roller coaster because I would scream. I'm a screamer. And I can't snuffle it. PERINO: The other reason he probably wouldn't want to go on the roller coaster, Greg, is because he wouldn't want to mess up his hair. GUTFELD: That is true. Did you notice that -- WATTERS: Good point. GUTFELD: did you notice that COVID strikes everything that's fun? Rollercoasters, going to bars, going to parties, hugging your grandmother, these are all fun things. Wouldn't it be great if there was an illness that told you, you had to avoid really boring things? Like there's a new mysterious deadly disease that only strikes when you watch CNN. So don't watch CNN. PERINO: That's -- you know, we could start the rumor. We could start the rumor. Juan Williams, how do you feel about this? I mean, in Japan, they have a lot of self-control. WILLIAMS: Yes, well, that would take a lot of self-control, Dana. I don't ride roller coasters, but when I am forced to because of children, I just close my eyes and grit my teeth. I don't scream but it's like an internal scream, I tell you that. PERINO: Yes. Well, you know, I don't like noises so a silent rollercoaster ride could be maybe something I would like. I can't go on anymore anyway. I'm too old and too short. All right, \"ONE MORE THING\" is up next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) GUTFELD: It's time now for \"ONE MORE THING.\" I'm going to go first. And you know what I'm going to do? I'm going to plug my book because every now and then I do that. It's called The Plus. It will make your life better. It's the only self-help book ever made for people who hate self-help, and it's changed my life for the better. Can't you tell? Anyway, you can go to Greg -- = , or you can go to Amazon or = and order. And if you don't like it, wow, Dana will refund the money. Right, Dana? PERINO: Yes, absolutely. Just send me a note. GUTFELD: There you go. PERINO: Send me your Venmo. GUTFELD: Yes. Send her a note. Yes, send her a Venmo. I've never done Venmo. But anyway, that's neither here nor there. Dana, you are next. PERINO: All right, I want to talk about a dog, but not my dog. OK, so this is where a dog has learned all of these words, but they basically -- he can communicate with them by using a soundboard. Check this out. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Home. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes, exactly. We're home now. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Love you, mom. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Oh, I love you too bunny. (END VIDEO CLIP) PERINO: So, that's a one-year-old sheepadoodle. His owner is Alexis and she introduced him to this special soundboard. And he has 45 different words that he knows. He can do Hi, Yes, Goodbye, and Want. He even has learned outside for whenever he has to go out to use the restroom. So I think that's very clever, and I'm sad I didn't think of it first. GUTFELD: You know, Dana, my ferret and I often play the Ouija board together. PERINO: And what do you learn? GUTFELD: I just thought I'd tell you that. Well, we learned that he has a lot of dead friends. It's sad but true. Jesse? WATTERS: I would love to just take that soundbite right there, and just clip that out. It's brilliant, Greg. First, I'd just like to wish you a very speedy recovery to Connie Broussard. And we hope she's doing well and getting better very soon. All right, so we have Jesse's Friendly Neighborhood Dispute news. And it's an update now. PERINO: Right. WATTERS: Here we go. Remember the clip we showed you yesterday, the guy mowed the lawn, and he left his neighbor's like lawn uncut, basically like two feet of it uncut just to prove a point. Well, was this the right move or the wrong move? So we asked everybody to weigh in and 4,000 of you guys weighed in. Here's some of the comments. Dana's aunt Patty Sue weighing in saying \"No. If you are mowing your side, be a good neighbor and take two more swipes.\" Here's some others. \"No, has to be a Democrat. He mowed the left only.\" Makes sense. And \"Yes, because if you do they'll accuse you of trying to steal their property.\" Maybe. And then, \"Yes, it's OK to mow just your lawn. Where does it stop though, trash cans, washing a car in the driveway, the paper?\" It never stops. So the results are in. 65 percent said yes, it's OK to mow your lawn like that and leave your neighbor that measly little strip just to prove a point. I didn't want to say anything because I didn't want it to be a push poll. I would never do that. I would just mow my neighbor's lawn like that. But America disagrees again with me and my mowing and my poop problems. So there you have it. I'm out of the mainstream. PERINO: We want to cut that sound bite. GUTFELD: There you go. You're not going to be a pain in the grass. All right, Juan? WILLIAMS: All right, so you guys know I love ice cream as you can see from this video with Dana and Emily as I was eating ice cream last year at serendipity in New York City. Well, this summer, there are going to be some new flavors. Take a look at what the Heinz company is serving up. They have Do It Yourself kits to create ice cream in some very unusual flavors like mayonnaise, barbecue, salad dressing, and of course, Heinz ketchup. WATTERS: What? WILLIAMS: Each recipe kit comes with a golden spoon, golden ice cream scoop, and a bottle of your favorite condiment, I guess a lot of ketchup. The kits cost $17. But currently, you can only get them in England. My fear is they're going to be here soon because I don't think I could stomach it. GUTFELD: Kennedy, you've got 20 seconds. MONTGOMERY: All right, Oregon, keep Oregon weird. These two people did. A guy in a stolen car hit a woman with that stolen car. Guess what? Her car was also stolen. And it's right a couple of larcenists and she was boozed up. Good job, Oregon. ", "comment": "", "topic": "TRANSCRIPT", "date": " July 8"}]
