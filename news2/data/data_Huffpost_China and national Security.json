China will make legitimate and necessary reactions,\u201d the statement said.\nChina maintains consulates in San Francisco, Los Angeles, Chicago and New York in addition to its embassy in Washington.\nThe U.S. has four other consulates in China and an embassy in Beijing, keeping the sides in parity in terms of diplomatic missions.\nThe Chengdu consulate briefly came to prominence when the police chief of the nearby city of Chongqing fled there in 2012, precipitating the downfall of Chongqing\u2019s politically ambitious leader Bo Xilai in China\u2019s biggest political scandal in decades. It also played host to former Vice President Joe Biden during a visit when the current prospective Democratic Party presidential candidate was accompanied by China\u2019s now-leader Xi Jinping.\nPolice closed off a two- to three-block area around the consulate, cutting off virtually any view of the property including the flag. A few vehicles were allowed through after police checks, and others could be seen moving in the distance.\nMoving trucks arrived at the U.S. consulate the previous day and left a few hours later. Late Sunday night, flatbed trailers entered the complex. One later emerged carrying a large shipping container and a crane.\nBefore the area was closed, the impending closure of the consulate drew a steady stream of onlookers over the weekend as Chengdu, like Houston, found itself in the limelight of international politics.\nPeople stopped to take selfies and photos, jamming a sidewalk busy with shoppers and families with strollers on a sunny day in the city of Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan province. A little boy posed with a small Chinese flag before plainclothes police shooed him away as foreign media cameras zoomed in.\nPolice had shut the street and sidewalk in front of the consulate and set up metal barriers along the sidewalk on the other side of the tree-lined road.\nUniformed and plainclothes officers kept watch on both sides of the barriers after scattered incidents following the Chengdu announcement on Friday, including a man who set off firecrackers and hecklers who cursed at foreign media shooting video and photos of the scene.\nA man who tried to unfurl a large placard late Sunday that he called an open letter to the Chinese government was quickly taken away.\nEarlier, a bus left the consulate grounds and what appeared to be embassy staff spoke with plainclothes police before retreating back behind the property\u2019s solid black gates. It wasn\u2019t clear who or what was on the bus.\nThree medium-size trucks arrived and left a few hours later, and cars with diplomatic plates departed in between.\nThe U.S. alleged that the Houston consulate was a nest of Chinese spies who tried to steal data from facilities in Texas, including the Texas A&M medical system and the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston. China said the allegations were \u201cmalicious slander.\u201d\n\n\u00a0"}, {"cover": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/8nEqxHBgFigVYsKzhQaA5g--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5f1b6f63220000e00d387904.jpg", "topic": "POLITICS", "title": "As A Candidate, Trump Asked FBI In Intelligence Briefing: 'Are The Russians Bad?'", "author": "By Mary Papenfuss", "date": "July 25, 2020", "url": "https://search.huffpost.com/click/_ylt=Awr9ImPTEC1frxoA7pBsBmVH;_ylu=X3oDMTByNWU4cGh1BGNvbG8DZ3ExBHBvcwMxBHZ0aWQDBHNlYwNzYw--/RV=2/RE=1596817747/RO=10/RU=https%3a%2f%2fwww.huffpost.com%2fentry%2ftrump-fbi-russian-interference-transcript_n_5f1b5514c5b6128e6825d9f0/RK=2/RS=b_9.6r5Q38.cWvMcVUV0KfQa6h4-", "keyword": "China and national Security", "website": "Huffpost", "subtitle": "GOP senators pushed to have this once-classified document released, but maybe they shouldn\u2019t have.", "content": "When the FBI gave candidate Donald Trump\u00a0his first intelligence briefing in 2016 and warned that foreign agents might try to infiltrate his campaign, Trump asked, \u201cAre the Russians bad?\u201d according to an official\u00a0summary of the meeting\u00a0obtained by Politico.The summary was filed as part of Operation Hurricane, the code name for the FBI investigation launched in August 2016 into suspected Kremlin interference in that year\u2019s election and possible ties to the Trump campaign.\u00a0Trump-appointed Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe declassified and released the summary of the briefing this week at the behest of Senate Republicans looking to present the FBI as targeting Trump even before his election.But Trump\u2019s own comments about Russia, related in the FBI summary, place him in a less-than-favorable light \u2014 revealing him to be either incredibly gullible and unsophisticated in his understanding, or deliberately disingenuous about Russia.Michael Flynn, who would later go on to be Trump\u2019s national security adviser, and former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, Trump\u2019s transition team leader, were also at the 13-minute briefing, in which FBI agent Joe Pientka\u00a0presented them with the basics of the threat to U.S. security.\u00a0According to Pientka\u2019s summary, Trump asked him if the Russians were more dangerous than the Chinese because they have more operatives in the U.S.The agent said both countries are bad and told the men that the number of operatives was \u201cnot an indicator of the severity of the threat,\u201d according to the document.The FBI agent then shared that when he told Trump and his team that the U.S. is a \u201cworld leader in counterintelligence,\u201d Trump asked: \u201cRussia, too?\u201dAccording to the summary, Trump also asked which country, Russia or China, was worse when it came to violations of nuclear testing bans and was told: \u201cThey are both bad, but Russia is worse.\u201d\u201cTrump and Christie turned toward each other, and Christie commented, \u2018I\u2019m shocked,\u2019\u201d Pientka wrote of their reactions to that information.Pientka also said he warned the men that foreign agents might try to approach their relatives, friends and campaign staff in the U.S. to obtain \u201cinformation pertaining to political,\u00a0economic, energy, technology and military policy/plans of the U.S.\u201d in order to \u201ccollect inside information to give their country a competitive advantage over the U.S.\u201dTrump was also advised to take special care with phone and electronic communications that could be hacked, according to the summary. Trump has repeatedly used his personal cell phone for official conversations, despite warnings from aides not to do so.Pientka, who would continue to be part of the Russia investigation, noted in his summary of the meeting that he was on the alert for any comments on Russia from the Trump team. \u201cDuring the [intelligence] briefs, writer actively listened for topics or questions regarding the Russian Federation,\u201d he wrote.Former White House Secretary Sarah Sanders told Fox News Friday that the transcript is proof the FBI was out to \u201ctake down\u201d Trump. But the transcript clearly shows Pientka offering advice to Trump and his team on how to deal with possible overtures by foreign agents. He was not questioning them.At the time of the briefing, the FBI had disturbing indications of Russian interference in the 2016 election, including a Kremlin-orchestrated hack of emails from the Democratic National Committee, which were published by\u00a0WikiLeaks\u00a0and benefited the Trump campaign.Trump later called on Russia to get his Democratic opponent\u00a0Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails, and those were hacked and leaked\u00a0as well.Despite his repeated insistence that the probe into Russian election interference was a \u201cwitch hunt,\u201d Trump has also attacked his predecessor\u00a0Barack Obama for not being aggressive enough in investigating Russia\u2019s actions.Robert Mueller\u2019s special counsel report last year concluded that the \u201cRussian government interfered in the 2016 presidential election in sweeping and systematic fashion\u201d in a way that \u201cfavored\u201d Trump. The report also noted numerous contacts between members of the Trump campaign and Kremlin representatives.By 2016, Trump had a long business history with Russia, and was even working to get a Trump tower built in Moscow. Eric Trump, one of the president\u2019s sons, told a golf journalist in 2014 that the Trump Organization had \u201call the funding we need out of Russia\u201d\u00a0\u2014 which he later denied saying."}, {"cover": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/_nsKtRh5eR1JNMwMB_ZHWQ--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5efc4c7a1f0000d1023374cb.jpg", "topic": "WORLD-NEWS", "title": "Hong Kong Police Make First Arrests Under New  Law Imposed By ", "author": "By Liza Hearon", "date": "July 1, 2020", "url": "https://search.huffpost.com/click/_ylt=Awr9ImPTEC1frxoA9pBsBmVH;_ylu=X3oDMTByNWU4cGh1BGNvbG8DZ3ExBHBvcwMxBHZ0aWQDBHNlYwNzYw--/RV=2/RE=1596817747/RO=10/RU=https%3a%2f%2fwww.huffpost.com%2fentry%2fhong-kong-police-first-arrests-security-law-china_n_5efc4709c5b612083c54de7c/RK=2/RS=zc33ta9C4WPBiVjePX7Ld4e5llU-", "keyword": "China and national Security", "website": "Huffpost", "subtitle": "Any person taking part in \u201csecessionist activities,\u201d such as shouting slogans or holding up banners urging for the city\u2019s independence, is in violation of the law.", "content": "HONG KONG (AP) \u2014 Hong Kong police made their first arrests Wednesday under a new national security law imposed a day earlier by China\u2019s central government, detaining at least seven people suspected of violating it during protests by thousands of people.Police said one man with a Hong Kong independence flag was arrested at a protest in the city\u2019s Causeway Bay shopping district. Police arrested another woman for holding up a sign displaying the British flag and calling for Hong Kong\u2019s independence. Three other women were detained for possessing items advocating independence. Further details were not immediately available.Hong Kong police said on Facebook that they arrested more than 180 people on various charges, including unlawful assembly, possession of weapons and violating the national security law.The arrests come as thousands took to the streets Wednesday in an anti-government protest on the 23rd anniversary of Britain\u2019s handover of Hong Kong to China in 1997. For the first time, police banned this year\u2019s annual march. Protesters shouted slogans, lambasted police and held up signs condemning the Chinese government and the new security law.The law, imposed by China following last year\u2019s anti-government protests in the semi-autonomous territory, makes secessionist, subversive, or terrorist activities illegal, as well as foreign intervention in the city\u2019s internal affairs. Any person taking part in secessionist activities, such as shouting slogans or holding up banners and flags calling for the city\u2019s independence, is violating the law regardless of whether violence is used.The most serious offenders, such as those deemed to be masterminds behind the crimes, could receive a maximum punishment of life imprisonment. Lesser offenders could receive jail terms of up to three years, short-term detention or restriction.Hong Kong\u2019s leader strongly endorsed the new law in a speech marking Wednesday\u2019s 23rd anniversary of the handover of the territory \u2014 officially called the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region \u2014 from British colonial rule.\u201cThe enactment of the national law is regarded as the most significant development in the relationship between the central authorities and the HKSAR since Hong Kong\u2019s return to the motherland,\u201d chief executive Carrie Lam said in a speech, following a flag-raising ceremony and the playing of China\u2019s national anthem.\u201cIt is also an essential and timely decision for restoring stability in Hong Kong,\u201d she said.A pro-democracy political party, The League of Social Democrats, organized a protest march during the flag-raising ceremony. About a dozen participants chanted slogans echoing demands from protesters last year for political reform and an investigation into accusations of police abuse.The law\u2019s passage Tuesday further blurs the distinction between the legal systems of Hong Kong, which maintained aspects of British law after the 1997 handover, and the mainland\u2019s authoritarian Communist Party system. Critics say the law effectively ends the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d framework under which Hong Kong was promised a high degree of autonomy.The law directly targets some of the actions of anti-government protesters last year, which included attacks on government offices and police stations, damage to subway stations and the shutdown of the city\u2019s international airport. Acts of vandalism against government facilities or public transit can be prosecuted as subversion or terrorism, while anyone taking part in activities deemed secessionist would also be in violation of the law.Pro-democracy lawmaker Claudia Mo said in a news conference that the security legislation does not abide by the rule of law and is a dire warning to the free press.\u201cThis would tell you that they want not just to get us, but to intimidate us into inaction, into a catatonic state,\u201d Mo said.Hong Kong\u2019s police force said they would consider as illegal any flag or banner raised by protesters deemed to promote Hong Kong\u2019s separation from China or express support for independence for Tibet, Xinjiang or the self-governing island democracy of Taiwan that China claims as its own.Police will use a new purple flag to warn protesters if they display banners or shout slogans that may constitute a crime under the law.Concerns have also been raised over the fate of key opposition figures, some of whom have already been charged for taking part in protests, as well as the disqualification of candidates for Legislative Council elections scheduled for September.In Beijing, the executive deputy director of the Cabinet\u2019s Hong Kong affairs office, Zhang Xiaoming, said Hong Kong people are allowed to criticize the ruling Communist Party but cannot turn those complaints \u201cinto actions.\u201d\u201cWhat happened recently in Hong Kong has shown a deviation from the right track of the \u2018one country, two systems\u2019 (framework),\u201d Zhang told reporters Wednesday.\u201cTo some extent, we made this law in order to correct the deviation ... to pull it closer to \u2018one-country.\u2019\u201dSchools, social groups, media outlets, websites and others will be monitored and their national security awareness will be raised, according to the law, while the central government will have authority over the activities of foreign non-governmental organizations and media outlets in Hong Kong.The law says central government bodies in Hong Kong will take over in \u201ccomplicated cases\u201d and when there is a serious threat to national security. Local authorities are barred from interfering with central government bodies operating in Hong Kong while they are carrying out their duties.Security legislation was mandated under Hong Kong\u2019s local constitution, but an earlier attempt to pass it in the city\u2019s legislative body in 2003 was shelved because of massive public opposition. Beijing finally decided to circumvent the Hong Kong legislature and have the law passed Tuesday by the Standing Committee of the National People\u2019s Congress, China\u2019s rubber-stamp parliament.President Xi Jinping signed a presidential order putting the law into effect, and it has been added to the Basic Law, Hong Kong\u2019s constitution.The law\u2019s passage comes after Hong Kong\u2019s legislature in early June approved a contentious bill making it illegal to insult the Chinese national anthem.The law\u2019s enactment deepened concerns abroad about Hong Kong\u2019s future.Britain\u2019s foreign secretary told reporters on Wednesday that the law \u201cis a clear and serious violation\u201d of the Sino-British Joint Declaration, the agreement that paved the way for the former British colony\u2019s handover to Chinese rule.Dominic Raab said officials have carefully assessed the law and he plans to set out details of what action the U.K. will take along with its international partners in response.The U.S. is moving to end special trade terms given to the territory. The Trump administration has also said it will bar defense exports to Hong Kong and will soon require licenses for the sale of items that have both civilian and military uses.The U.S. Congress has also moved to impose sanctions on people deemed connected to political repression in Hong Kong, including police officials, while Britain has said it could offer residency and possible citizenship to about 3 million of Hong Kong\u2019s 7.5 million people.China has said it will impose visa restrictions on Americans it sees as interfering over Hong Kong.U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo denounced the threat of a visa ban as a sign of \u201chow Beijing refuses to take responsibility for its own choices\u201d and said the law\u2019s adoption \u201cdestroys the territory\u2019s autonomy and one of China\u2019s greatest achievements.\u201dBeijing\u2019s \u201cparanoia and fear of its own people\u2019s aspirations have led it to eviscerate the very foundation of the territory\u2019s success,\u201d Pompeo said in a statement.Taiwan on Wednesday opened an office to facilitate migration from Hong Kong.The establishment of the office is \u201cnot only a statement on Taiwan\u2019s support to Hong Kong\u2019s democracy and freedom, but also highlights our determination to care for Hong Kong people,\u201d said Taiwan\u2019s Mainland Affairs Council minister Chen Ming-tong at a ribbon-cutting ceremony.___AP video journalist Johnson Lai in Taipei and producer Wayne Zhang in Beijing contributed to this report."}, {"cover": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/83FVmnzRembDUt4gpDMfbg--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5f1599d0270000e50de67143.jpg", "topic": "WORLD-NEWS", "title": "Coronavirus Live Updates: Read The Latest About The COVID-19 Outbreak", "author": "By Paige Lavender", "date": "July 20, 2020", "url": "https://search.huffpost.com/click/_ylt=Awr9ImPTEC1frxoA.JBsBmVH;_ylu=X3oDMTByNWU4cGh1BGNvbG8DZ3ExBHBvcwMxBHZ0aWQDBHNlYwNzYw--/RV=2/RE=1596817747/RO=10/RU=https%3a%2f%2fwww.huffpost.com%2fentry%2fcovid-19-latest-news-worldwide-updates_n_5f159982c5b6d14c336a1a6b/RK=2/RS=Sb7FasWx5ajbytOltIA9yHBaVFY-", "keyword": "China and national Security", "website": "Huffpost", "subtitle": "Stay up to date as we cover the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and its effects across the world.", "content": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince Chinese officials locked down the city of Wuhan in January, there have been more than 16.2 million cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, across the planet.\nMore than 648,000 people have died from the disease,\u00a0according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEfforts to curb the outbreak have led to the global disruption of daily life and the economy, as schools and workplaces shuttered in hopes of slowing transmission.

He is reportedly quarantining at home and continuing to work remotely.\nO\u2019Brien\u2019s diagnosis makes him the highest profile Trump administration official known to have tested positive for the virus. Vice President Mike Pence\u2019s press secretary\u00a0tested positive\u00a0in May, as did one of Trump\u2019s personal valets.

Andy Beshear (D) said Sunday that he planned to announce new restrictions early this week amid a surge in new cases. As of Monday, the state has\u00a0recorded more than 27,000 cases\u00a0and at least 718 deaths.

North Korea has previously denied having any cases of the virus, though outside experts have questioned that claim,\u00a0according to The Associated Press.\nNorth Korea\u2019s official Korean Central News Agency said the suspected virus patient had illegally entered the country last week after fleeing to South Korea three years ago. The patient, anyone who had contact with them, and those who were in Kaesong recently have been placed under quarantine, according to KCNA.\nDuring an emergency meeting of top North Korean officials, Kim was quoted as saying there was a \u201ccritical situation in which the vicious virus could be said to have entered the country.\u201d\nRead more from the AP\u00a0here.\n\u2014 Hayley Miller\nMore Than A Third Of Coronavirus Patients Feel Symptoms For Weeks \u2015 7/25/20, 11:35 a.m. ET\nMore than a third of coronavirus patients experience symptoms for weeks, even if they don\u2019t have a severe case of COVID-19, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Saturday.\nOf 293 people who had the virus surveyed by the CDC, 35% said they still felt negative symptoms two or three weeks after testing positive.\nWhile research is still limited, many people who experience long-term symptoms say those include fatigue, difficulty breathing and body aches, among other symptoms.\nA study of 143 patients in Italy found that 87% of those who had recovered from COVID-19 reported at least one lingering symptom, USA Today reported Saturday.\n\u201cWe definitely see prolonged symptoms, sometimes a lingering cough and the most serious cases have long term chest pains and still feel they can\u2019t breathe well,\u201d Dr. Maja Artandi, medical director of an outpatient COVID-19 clinic at Stanford University hospital, told the publication. \u201cIt just causes all kinds of inflammation and takes awhile to heal.\u201d\n\u2015 Sebastian Murdock\nCalifornia Expands Essential Workers\u2019 Protections Amid Coronavirus Pandemic \u2014 7/24/20, 7 p.m. ET\nCalifornia Gov.

Of those currently in hospital, 26% are in intensive care.\nPublic Health Director Barbara Ferrer said Monday that 63 health-care workers have died from COVID-19 and 49% of those were nurses.\nFerrer also said that contact tracing was proving difficult, with only 57% of people contacted providing information on their close contacts and employers. \u201cWe are limited in our ability to force people to share important information,\u201d Ferrer said.\u00a0Read more\n\u2014\u00a0Liza\u00a0Hearon\nFlorida Teachers Union Sues State Over Reopening Plans \u2015 7/20/2020, 4:15 p.m. ET\nThe Florida Education Association, a union representing the state\u2019s teachers, on Monday filed a lawsuit against state officials, saying plans to resume in-person instruction next month would put both students and educators at risk of contracting COVID-19.\n\u201cThe governor needs to accept the reality of the situation here in Florida, where the virus is surging out of control,\u201d FEA President Fedrick Ingram said in a statement. \u201cHe needs to accept the evolving science. It now appears that kids 10 and older may pass along the coronavirus as easily as adults. Everyone wants schools to reopen, but we don\u2019t want to begin in-person teaching, face an explosion of cases and sickness, then be forced to return to distance learning.\u201d\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) issued an emergency order earlier this month for schools to reopen for the upcoming school year.\nThe state has one of the worst coronavirus outbreaks in the country after reopening most of its economy without flattening the curve. As of last week, it had more COVID-19 cases than most nations in the world.\nOther teachers unions across the country are also gearing up to stop hasty reopening plans. In Ohio on Monday, the Columbus Education Association issued a letter signed by two-thirds of the district\u2019s teachers calling on officials to support distance learning instead of rushing students back to the classroom.\n\u2015 Lydia O\u2019Connor\nFirst Child In Minnesota Dies Of Coronavirus \u2014 7/20/20, 2:40 p.m. ET\nMinnesota\u2019s health department reported that a child has died from coronavirus, the first in the state.\nThe child\u2019s death was one of four deaths reported by the state on Monday. The other two cases were two people in their 60s, and a third person was in their 90s.\nThe state doesn\u2019t report on specific ages of COVID-19 patients, but the child was identified to be between 0 to 5 years old. This is the youngest death linked to the virus and the state\u2019s first death of a person under 20 years old.\nMinnesota reported 922 new cases of the virus in the state, bringing the total number of positive cases to 47,107.\n\u2015 Carla Russo\nChicago Reinstates Some Restrictions Amid Rise In Cases \u2014 7/20/20, 12:10 p.m. ET\nChicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot on Monday announced the \u201cre-tightening\u201d of some coronavirus restrictions amid a recent rise in daily new cases.\nBeginning Friday, many bars and breweries will no longer be able to serve alcohol indoors, restaurants must limit table occupancy to six people, all indoor fitness classes must limit attendance to 10 people, and personal services requiring the removal of face coverings \u2015 such as facials or shaves \u2015 will not be permitted.\n\u201cWe have made so much progress here in Chicago in containing the spread of the virus, protecting our health system and saving lives, and in general, the virus remains under control locally. But we are again seeing a steady increase in new cases,\u201d Lightfoot said in a statement. \u201cWhile we aren\u2019t near the peak of the pandemic from earlier this year, none of us wants to go back there, and we feel these restrictions will help limit further community spread.\u201d\nChicago Health Commissioner Allison Arwady warned last week that new restrictions were possible if the city exceeded 200 cases per day on a seven-day rolling average. As of Sunday, that number was 233. Chicago\u2019s positivity rate has also increased recently after weeks of decline.\nLightfoot\u2019s office attributed the increase in new cases, largely seen among people ages 18 to 29, to an increase in interactions at bars, restaurants and parks.\n\u2015 Hayley Miller\nU.K. Coronavirus Vaccine \u2018Safe\u2019 And Showing \u2018Promising Results,\u2019 Study Finds \u2015 7/20/20, 10:40 a.m. ET\nA potential coronavirus vaccine being developed in the U.K. has shown \u201cpromising\u201d early results, researchers reported Monday.\nThe experimental vaccine developed by the University of Oxford and pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca is \u201csafe, causes few side effects, and induces strong immune responses,\u201d according to the results of vaccine trials published Monday in The Lancet, a peer-reviewed medical journal.\nThe vaccine candidate, called ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, is one of more than 100 being developed globally.

In the communist-ruled mainland, the foreign social media platforms are blocked by China\u2019s \u201cGreat Firewall.\u201dCritics see the law as Beijing\u2019s boldest step yet to erase the legal divide between the former British colony and the mainland\u2019s authoritarian Communist Party system.TikTok said in a statement that it had decided to halt operations \u201cin light of recent events.\u201dFacebook and its messaging app WhatsApp said in separate statements Monday that they would freeze the review of government requests for user data in Hong Kong, \u201cpending further assessment of the National Security Law, including formal human rights due diligence and consultations with international human rights experts.\u201dHong Kong was convulsed with massive, sometimes violent anti-government protests for much of last year as the former British colony\u2019s residents reacted to proposed extradition legislation, since withdrawn, that might have led to some suspects facing trial in mainland Chinese courts.The new law criminalizes some pro-democracy slogans like the widely used \u201cLiberate Hong Kong, revolution of our time,\u201d which the Hong Kong government says has separatist connotations.The fear is that it erodes the special freedoms of the semi-autonomous city, which has operated under a \u201cone country, two systems\u201d framework since China took control in 1997. That arrangement has allowed Hong Kong\u2019s people freedoms not permitted in mainland China, such as public dissent and unrestricted internet access.Telegram\u2019s platform has been used widely to spread pro-democracy messages and information about the protests. It understands \u201cthe importance of protecting the right to privacy of our Hong Kong users,\u201d said Mike Ravdonikas, a spokesperson for the company.\u201cTelegram has never shared any data with the Hong Kong authorities in the past and does not intend to process any data requests related to its Hong Kong users until an international consensus is reached in relation to the ongoing political changes in the city,\u201d he said.Twitter also paused all data and information requests from Hong Kong authorities after the security law went into effect last week, the company said, emphasizing that it was \u201ccommitted to protecting the people using our service and their freedom of expression.\u201d\u201cLike many public interest organisations, civil society leaders and entities, and industry peers, we have grave concerns regarding both the developing process and the full intention of this law,\u201d the company said in a statement.Google likewise said it had \u201cpaused production on any new data requests from Hong Kong authorities.\u201dThough social platforms have yet to be blocked in Hong Kong, users have begun scrubbing their accounts and deleting pro-democracy posts out of fear of retribution. That retreat has extended to the streets: Many shops and stores that publicly stood in solidarity with protesters have removed the pro-democracy sticky notes and artwork that had adorned their walls.Under implementation rules of Article 43 of the national security law, which give the city\u2019s police force sweeping powers in enforcing the legislation, platforms, publishers and internet service providers may be ordered to take down any electronic message published that is \u201clikely to constitute an offence endangering national security or is likely to cause the occurrence of an offence endangering national security.\u201dService providers who do not comply with such requests could face fines of up to 100,000 Hong Kong dollars ($12,903) and receive jail terms of up to six months.Individuals who post such messages may also be asked to remove the message, or face similar fines and a jail term of one year.Hong Kong authorities moved quickly to implement the law after it took effect on June 30, with police arresting about 370 people.The rules allow Hong Kong chief executive Carrie Lam to authorize police to intercept communications and conduct surveillance to \u201cprevent and detect offences endangering national security.\u201dPolice can conduct searches for evidence without a warrant in \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d and seek warrants requiring people suspected of violating the national security law to surrender their travel documents, preventing them from leaving Hong Kong.Written notices or restraining orders also may be issued to freeze or confiscate property if there are \u201creasonable grounds\u201d to suspect that the property is related to an offense endangering national security.TikTok, operated by Chinese internet giant Bytedance, has sought to distance itself from its Chinese roots while striving for global appeal. It recently hired former Walt Disney executive Kevin Mayer to be its CEO.The company has said all its data is stored in servers in the U.S. and insisted it would not remove content even if asked to do so by the Chinese government. Even so, TikTok has still been regarded as a national security risk, with U.S. secretary of state Michael Pompeo saying Monday that it was looking at banning certain social media apps, including TikTok."}, {"cover": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/kOMiR3AX647Tf0RX5RbLlQ--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5f11e2c82200002a0c387320.jpg", "topic": "HUFFPOST-HOME", "title": "Should You Delete TikTok?

Beijing unveiled details of the legislation late on Tuesday and the law came too effect on Wednesday.The new law punishes crimes of secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces with up to life in prison. It will also see mainland security agencies in\u00a0Hong\u00a0Kong\u00a0for the first time and allows extradition to the mainland for trial in courts controlled by the Communist Party.China\u2019s parliament adopted the security law in response to protests last year triggered by fears Beijing was stifling the city\u2019s freedoms and threatening its judicial independence, guaranteed by a \u201cone country, two systems\u201d formula agreed when it returned to China.Beijing denies the accusation.The law has triggered alarm among democracy activists and rights groups.

But in recent weeks, President Donald Trump and his team have led a brazen attack on COVID-19 science and scientists in a desperate effort to deny away a deadly pandemic that the administration\u2019s incompetence has made far worse. That effort has included downplaying the ongoing threat, diverting crucial hospital data from the CDC, smearing infectious disease expert Dr. Anthony Fauci, and casting blame on China, the World Health Organization and Americans from Northern states.\u00a0The COVID response is part of the Trump administration\u2019s long war on all forms of science and expertise. The administration has cast out or discredited science that does not align with Trump\u2019s fossil fuel-centric \u201cenergy dominance\u201d agenda, his reelection campaign or, in some cases, that contradicts what the president said on Twitter.The president himself has repeatedly denied climate change, questioned the science of vaccinations and invented weather forecasts for a hurricane. When hundreds of researchers from more than a dozen federal agencies warned in a November 2018 report that the world is barreling toward catastrophic climate change, Trump simply said of the findings: \u201cI don\u2019t believe it.\u201d His anti-science beliefs have been made into policy by the ex-industry lobbyists appointed to run environmental and scientific agencies across his administration.\u00a0The president on Wednesday traveled to Atlanta \u2015 a current hotspot of the virus \u2015 to speak unmasked at a UPS facility, where he announced a major rollback of one of the nation\u2019s most important environmental laws, the National Environmental Policy Act. Among other things, the rollback fast-tracks oil pipelines, power plants and other major infrastructure projects by limiting the number that require in-depth environmental reviews, as well as allowing federal agencies to ignore how developments impact climate change.\u00a0At the event, Trump thanked UPS drivers for continuing to deliver packages during America\u2019s \u201cbattle against the China virus,\u201d one of several racist terms he continues to use to describe coronavirus.While much of Trump\u2019s opposition to climate and environmental science is common among Republican presidents and lawmakers, the ongoing coronavirus pandemic shows how deadly this rejection of science can be. And his strategy heading into the 2020 election appears to be to convince Americans that the death and suffering happening around them isn\u2019t really that bad, and certainly isn\u2019t his fault.Attacking The MessengerWhile denial and finger-pointing have dominated Trump\u2019s coronavirus response from the start, the assault on reality has escalated in recent weeks. Most alarming is the administration\u2019s new effort to undermine Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and the person a majority of Americans have come to trust during the pandemic.The White House\u2019s most direct effort began on Sunday, when it distributed what looked like campaign opposition research to reporters listing Fauci\u2019s perceived misjudgments about the pandemic before the virus spread was recognized. Stories appeared noting that the Trump administration was preparing an attack on Fauci, but these attacks were all attributed to unnamed administration officials.By then, it had been more than a month since Fauci had spoken with the president, The Washington Post reported. The administration had stopped sending Fauci out for major media interviews as they were displeased that he did not endorse reopening the economy nor did he take part in Trump\u2019s happy talk that the virus will \u201cjust disappear.\u201d\u00a0\u201cDr. Fauci is a nice man, but he\u2019s made a lot of mistakes,\u201d Trump told Fox News\u2019 Sean Hannity in a July 9 interview.Fauci has continued to appear on podcasts and do interviews with online publications.\u201c[A]s a country, when you compare us to other countries, I don\u2019t think you can say we\u2019re doing great,\u201d Fauci said on a FiveThiryEight.com podcast that aired on July 9. \u201cI mean, we\u2019re just not.\u201dThe White House clearly decided that the nation\u2019s leading infectious disease expert was out over his skis to speak plainly about the worst pandemic in a century. His concern about controlling a public health crisis had become a distraction from Trump\u2019s effort to restart the economy, a central task of his reelection campaign.Fauci \u201cdoesn\u2019t necessarily \u2026 have the whole national interest in mind,\u201d Adm. Brett P. Giroir, assistant secretary for the Department of Health and Human Services, said on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d on Sunday. \u201cHe looks at it from a very narrow public health point of view.\u201dThe attacks on Fauci escalated when USA Today published an op-ed from White House trade adviser Peter Navarro on Tuesday in which he aired his grievances about the public health official. \u201cDr. Anthony Fauci has a good bedside manner with the public, but he has been wrong about everything I have interacted with him on,\u201d Navarro wrote.The White House attempted to downplay Navarro\u2019s falsehood-ridden attacks by asserting that he published the op-ed on his own without official approval. In prior administrations, this act would be a fireable offense. In this one, there\u2019s little indication that Navarro will be punished at all.Fauci told The Atlantic in an interview published Wednesday that he has no plans to step down and called the White House\u2019s attack against him \u201cbizarre,\u201d \u201cnonsense\u201d and \u201ccompletely wrong.\u201d\u201cUltimately, it hurts the president to do that,\u201d he said.\u00a0Passing The BuckTrump has continually refused to take any blame for negligence or errors in his administration\u2019s response to the pandemic.\u201cI don\u2019t take responsibility at all,\u201d he said at a now-infamous Rose Garden press conference on March 13, the day the nation began to go into lockdown.\u00a0It was instead former President Barack Obama\u2019s fault, Trump claimed. Trump\u2019s attempt to pass the buck to the previous administration came despite his disbanding of a pandemic response team at the National Security Council and his refusal to follow the plan used by the Obama administration to successfully respond to both the H1N1 and Ebola viruses.\u00a0More recently, Trump has claimed that former vice president Joe \u201cBiden and Obama stopped their testing,\u201d despite the coronavirus not existing until three years after they left office.Trump has stuck to that narrative, claiming that his own excellent work prevented potentially millions of additional deaths. At an event Tuesday that was billed as a White House press conference but quickly devolved into a rambling campaign rally-style speech, Trump railed against China, for \u201cconcealing\u201d and \u201cunleashing\u201d the coronavirus \u201cupon the world,\u201d and the World Health Organization \u2015 a go-to move to distract from his own botched pandemic response.\u00a0He dismissed the WHO as \u201ca puppet of China\u201d and a \u201cterrible deal,\u201d and bragged about cutting ties with the world body and redirecting the approximately $450 million the U.S. contributes to it each year.\u201cWe\u2019ve been I guess as tough as you can get on World Health,\u201d Trump said Tuesday. \u201cWe withdrew our money, we told them we\u2019re getting out. Doesn\u2019t mean that someday we won\u2019t go back in, maybe we will when it\u2019s correctly run. But they made a lot of bad predictions and they said a lot of bad things about what to do and how to do it, and they turned out to be wrong.It\u2019s truly baffling stuff from the leader of a country that is among the most ravaged by the coronavirus, with 3.45 million infections to date.Trump\u2019s withdrawal from the WHO is not the only counterproductive policy change that he has pursued due to his need to control his image rather than abide by decisions informed by public health science.The Real DamageThe president\u2019s rejection of expertise, histrionic defensiveness and bizarre false statements are not simply utterances of an uninformed man. They inform the administration\u2019s policies that are undermining efforts to control the virus\u2019s spread, which means more Americans will die.His administration was slow to fund testing across the country, failed to properly promote mask-wearing when it became clear it would help slow the virus\u2019s spread, purchased tens of millions of reserves of Trump\u2019s favorite unproven coronavirus remedy hydroxychloroquine and is now rerouting hospital data away from the CDC, in a seeming effort to keep the public in the dark.\u201cI said to my people, \u2018Slow the testing down, please,\u2019\u201d Trump told the crowd at an indoor campaign rally he hosted on June 20 that was likely the source of a surge in virus cases in Tulsa, Oklahoma.On June 24, the administration announced it would close 13 federally funded COVID testing sites.Trump has repeatedly claimed, falsely, that the only reason the country is seeing an increase in cases is because more tests are being conducted. Public health officials have countered this falsehood, pointing to the data on COVID-19 hospitalizations reported to the CDC.But the administration announced on Tuesday that hospitals should cease reporting such data to the CDC and instead direct it to a private data collector that the Department of Health and Human Services has contracted. The move puts the data collection under the control of more partisan officials close to the Trump White House where it is not currently publicly reported. Already, COVID tracking sites report that the digital CDC data stream they relied on to provide public updates on the virus has stopped.In much the same way that denying and undermining climate science allows Trump to justify scrapping and weakening environmental rules to the benefit of polluting industries that helped bankroll his campaign, covering up and dismissing COVID-19 data is about protecting himself.\u00a0But like climate science, the science of this virus is not on Trump\u2019s side. It shows that his team\u2019s lethargic initial response and subsequent push to quickly reopen the economy has had devastating impacts. And that\u2019s exactly why the president will spend the next four months spinning a revisionist history."}, {"cover": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/dPAC0MWQqfU9NNRB8Fgnqw--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5efe4d9c2200006c043865c1.jpg", "topic": "POLITICS", "title": "America Spends Billions To Get The Best Intel In The World But Can\u2019t Make Trump Read It", "author": "By S.V.

A pharmacist picked up from work after posting online about a shortage of protective gear. An editor taken from his home after questioning official coronavirus figures. A pregnant doctor arrested after a colleague used her phone to report a suspected coronavirus case.As Egyptian authorities fight the swelling coronavirus outbreak, security agencies have tried to stifle criticism about the handling of the health crisis by the government of President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi.At least 10 doctors and six journalists have been arrested since the virus first hit Egypt in February, according to rights groups. Other health workers say they have been warned by administrators to keep quiet or face punishment. One foreign correspondent has fled the country, fearing arrest, and another two have been summoned for reprimand over \u201cprofessional violations.\u201dCoronavirus infections are surging in the country of 100 million, threatening to overwhelm hospitals. As of Monday, the Health Ministry had recorded 76,253 infections, including 3,343 deaths \u2014 the highest death toll in the Arab world.\u201cEvery day I go to work, I sacrifice myself and my whole family,\u201d said a front-line doctor in greater Cairo, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals, like all doctors interviewed for this story. \u201cThen they arrest my colleagues to send us a message. I see no light on the horizon.\u201dIn 2013, el-Sissi, as defense minister, led the military\u2019s removal of Egypt\u2019s first democratically elected president, Mohamed Morsi, after his brief rule sparked nationwide protests. In years since, el-Sissi has stamped out dissent, jailing Islamist political opponents, secular activists, journalists, even belly dancers.Now the clampdown has extended to doctors who speak publicly about missing protective gear or question the official infection count.A government press officer did not respond to requests for comment on the arrests of doctors and journalists but did send The Associated Press a document entitled \u201cRealities defeating evil falsehoods,\u201d which details what it says are el-Sissi\u2019s successes in improving the economy and fighting terrorism.El-Sissi has said the virus\u2019s trajectory was \u201creassuring\u201d and described critics as \u201cenemies of the state.\u201d\u00a0In recent weeks, authorities have marshaled medical supplies to prepare for more patients. The military has set up field hospitals and isolation centers with 4,000 beds and delivered masks to citizens, free of charge, at metro stops, squares and other public places.The government has scaled up testing within all general hospitals and ordered private companies to churn out face masks and gear for front-line health workers. El-Sissi has ordered bonuses for medical workers equivalent to $44-$76 a month.But health personnel are sounding alarm on social media. Doctors say shortages have forced them to purchase surgical masks with their meager salaries. Families plead for intensive care beds. Dentists and pharmacists complain of being forced to handle suspected virus patients with little training.The pandemic has pushed the Egyptian Medical Syndicate, a non-political group of professionals, into a striking new role as the country\u2019s sole advocate for doctors\u2019 rights.Last month, the union released a letter to the public prosecutor demanding the release of five doctors detained for expressing their views about the government virus response. More syndicate members have been arrested than reported, said one board member, but families have kept quiet.Doctors\u2019 low morale sank further last week, following the arrest of board member and treasurer Mohamed el-Fawal, who demanded on Facebook that the prime minister apologize for comments that appeared to blame health workers for a spike in coronavirus deaths.In a televised briefing, Prime Minister Mustafa Madbouly criticized doctors\u2019 \u201cnegligence and mismanagement\u201d for endangering citizens\u2019 health.Incensed doctors hit back, saying they\u2019re untrained, underpaid and under-resourced, struggling to save patients at crowded clinics. So far at least 117 doctors, 39 nurses and 32 pharmacists have died from COVID-19, according to syndicate members\u2019 counts, and thousands have fallen ill.After Madbouly\u2019s comments, the union scheduled a press conference in late June to raise awareness about doctors\u2019 sacrifices and discuss staff and supply shortages. But before anyone could speak out, security forces surrounded the syndicate and sent members home, according to former leader Mona Mina. A communications officer who promoted the event was detained and interrogated by security agents for hours, said a board member, before being released.In its latest statement, the syndicate said the accelerating detentions have caused \u201cwidespread anxiety\u201d among health workers.\u201cThese doctors have no history of activism, they were arrested because they offered criticism of their very specific professional circumstances,\u201d said Amr Magdi of Human Rights Watch, which has confirmed the arrests of eight doctors and two pharmacists. Two have been released, he said, while the rest remain in pretrial detention.Last week, Dr. Ahmed Safwat, an intensive care doctor in the Cairo suburb of Nasr City and syndicate board member, disappeared, according to social media posts from fellow doctors. Because he had experienced virus symptoms, many assumed he was self-isolating at home until his family filed a complaint to the syndicate, saying they hadn\u2019t heard from him in days. A lawyer representing several detained doctors confirmed that he had been taken by state security and accused of terrorism activities. His last Facebook post also criticized the prime minister\u2019s comments, adding, \u201cThe government says that everything is fine and under control, but you enter hospitals and find the opposite.\u201dIn another case, security agents burst into the home of Hany Bakr, an ophthalmologist north of Cairo, according to his lawyer and Amnesty International, over his Facebook post that criticized the government for sending coronavirus aid to Italy and China while its own doctors were desperately short of protective equipment. He remains in detention on terrorism charges, his lawyer added.In March, public prosecutors accused 26-year-old Alaa Shaaban Hamida of \u201cjoining a terrorist group\u201d and \u201cmisusing social media\u201d after she allowed a colleague to call the Health Ministry\u2019s coronavirus hotline from her phone instead of first reporting the case to her managers, according to Amnesty International. Three months pregnant, she remains in pretrial detention.Doctors in three different provinces say their administrators have threatened to report them to the National Security Agency if they expressed frustration over working conditions, walked off the job or called in sick.In one of several voice recordings obtained by The Associated Press, a health deputy in the Nile Delta province of Beheira can be heard telling workers, \u201cEven if a doctor is dying, he must keep working \u2026 or be subjected to the most severe punishment.\u201dIn another message sent to staff, a hospital director in the same province describes those who fail to show up to work as \u201ctraitors,\u201d adding, \u201cthis will be treated as a national security matter ... and you know how that goes in Egypt.\u201dA doctor in Cairo shared WhatsApp messages with the AP from his manager, alerting staff that their attendance sheets were monitored by state security. He said two of his colleagues received a pay cut when administrators discovered their complaints on social media. In two other hospitals in the capital, workers retracted letters of collective resignation over working conditions for fear of reprisals.The suppression of criticism in Egypt is hardly unusual, analysts say, but the government has become even more jittery as the pandemic tests its capabilities and slows the economy.Although el-Sissi resisted a total lockdown because of the economic impact, schools, mosques, restaurants, malls and clubs were closed early in the outbreak and a nightly curfew imposed.With borders shut and cruise ships docked, Egypt\u2019s critical tourism revenue has disappeared, among other sources of income. The country secured a badly needed $5.2 billion loan from the International Monetary Fund in June, on top of a previous $2.8 billion arrangement.Last week, fearing further economic fallout, the government reopened much of society and welcomed hundreds of international tourists back to resorts, even as daily reported deaths exceeded 80. Restaurants and cafes are reopening with some continued restrictions, and masks have been mandated in public.\u201cBecause of Egypt\u2019s constant attention to its image as a place open for tourism, open for business, open for investment, authorities appear particularly sensitive to divergent perspectives during the pandemic,\u201d said Amy Hawthorne, an Egypt expert at the Project on Middle East Democracy. \u201cThey want to project an image that everything is fine, they\u2019re in control.\u201dThose who spread \u201cfalse news\u201d online about the coronavirus could face up to five years imprisonment and steep fines, Egypt\u2019s top prosecutor warned this spring.The U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights voiced concern in late March that 15 individuals had been arrested for broadcasting alleged false news about the pandemic. Four Egyptian journalists who reported on the outbreak remain in prison, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, which has labeled Egypt one of the world\u2019s worst jailers of journalists, along with Turkey and China.Security forces have also taken aggressive action against foreign reporters. In March, Egypt expelled a reporter for The Guardian who cited a scientific report disputing the official virus count. Egypt\u2019s state information body has summoned The Washington Post and New York Times correspondents over their critical coverage during the pandemic.Despite growing human rights abuses, the international community counts on Egypt as a bulwark against regional instability, said a Middle East-focused rights advocate at the U.N., speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss policy matters.\u201cThere is no appetite,\u201d the advocate said, \u201cto address what is going on in Egypt, let alone sanction them in any way for what the government is doing to their own people.\u201d\nA HuffPost Guide To Coronavirus\n\nStay up to date with our live blog as we cover the COVID-19 pandemic\n7 essential pieces of relationship advice for couples in quarantine\nWhat you need to know about face masks right now\nHow to tell if you need to start doing online therapy\n\nLost your job due to coronavirus?

The unemployment rate has jumped to above 11% nationally, and nearly one-third of U.S. households missed their rent or mortgage payments in July. The death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police officers has set off a national debate on policing and race.Instead of promoting policies to help the country battle its economic doldrums, its long history of racism or the rampaging pandemic, Republicans running for Congress are often arguing about who supports President Donald Trump the most or who said the meanest thing about him four years ago.\u00a0In races set for Tuesday in Alabama, Maine and Texas, the battle on the airwaves has revolved around each candidate\u2019s loyalty to Trump, the latest display of how internal GOP politics are dictated by the president\u2019s whims and desires to the exclusion of even the most important policy fights.\u201cThere\u2019s nothing as powerful an asset in a Republican primary as President Trump\u2019s endorsement, because he\u2019s done what he promised and has governed as a conservative,\u201d said Joe Kildea, a spokesperson for the Club for Growth, a conservative group that has aired ads in Maine and Alabama attacking Republicans it deems insufficiently pro-Trump.\u00a0Sinking SessionsThe highest-profile race is taking place in Alabama, where public polling shows former Attorney General Jeff Sessions trailing behind former Auburn University football coach Tommy Tuberville in a runoff battle for the GOP Senate nomination. The winner of the race will be a favorite to reclaim the seat for Republicans against Democratic Sen. Doug Jones.\u00a0Sessions, who held the seat before joining the Trump administration and had won reelection four times, once with nearly 98% of the vote, would normally be an overwhelming favorite. But Trump, angered by Sessions\u2019 decision to recuse himself from an investigation into Trump\u2019s potential collusion with Russia during the 2016 election, endorsed Tuberville shortly after the February runoff election. He called Sessions \u2015 the first senator to endorse him in 2016 and the man who helped craft his anti-immigration platform \u2015 \u201ca disaster who has let us all down.\u201dEarly in the race, Sessions tried to fight back, airing ads that highlighted comments Tuberville made criticizing Trump\u2019s handling of trade with China and undocumented immigration. But after Trump\u2019s endorsement, his campaign abandoned that tack. In the closing days of the race, Sessions\u2019 team has unleashed a grab bag of attacks on Tuberville, criticizing his role in a failed hedge fund and slamming him for refusing to debate during the runoff and for living part-time in Florida.Tuberville, meanwhile, has mostly played the hits and dodged the press. His most recent ad quotes a tweet from Trump, then plays a clip of Trump saying that appointing Sessions was his biggest regret as president. On Monday night, Tuberville tweeted out an audio clip of Trump praising him and bashing Sessions.\u201cTommy Tuberville will have a call direct line in to my office,\u201d Trump says in the clip. \u201cWe had the Jeff Sessions thing, we gave it a shot. I had no idea it could be as bad it was, but he had no clue.\u201d\u00a0As Tuberville and Sessions have battled over Trump\u2019s blessing, coronavirus cases in Alabama have spiked, with 5,000 new infections confirmed this past weekend. Jones\u2019 second ad of the campaign, released earlier this month, is a simple call for Alabamans to wear a face mask to prevent the spread of the virus.Rescuing An Ally From ScandalIf the Alabama race shows how Trump has the power to essentially end the career of a longtime power broker, a runoff election in Texas\u2019 13th Congressional District shows how his endorsement can lift a candidate who might otherwise have to fight off the lingering scent of a scandal.The 13th District, which covers much of the Texas panhandle along with parts of North Texas, is among the most solidly Republican districts in the country. Rep. Mac Thornberry held the seat for 13 terms and then endorsed Josh Winegarner, an agriculture industry lobbyist, to replace him when he decided to retire earlier this year.But Trump chose to endorse White House doctor Ronny Jackson, whom he had previously nominated to lead the Department of Veterans Affairs before a scandal over allegations that Jackson improperly dispensed medication forced Trump to withdraw the nomination. Jackson grew up in a neighboring district and had only moved to the 13th District in 2019 after retiring from the Navy.\u201cHe stood with Donald Trump, against the swamp,\u201d a narrator says in one of Jackson\u2019s campaign ads, which alleges that \u201cthe liberal left used lies against Ronny Jackson to attack President Trump.\u201dWinegarner and a super PAC supporting him have fought back with ads playing up his roots in the district and attacking Jackson over his scandals, calling him \u201cthe candyman\u201d and an \u201cObama Republican.\u201dNeither candidate\u2019s ads have mentioned the pandemic.\u00a0Winegarner was the clear leader in the first round of voting in February, winning 39% of the vote to Jackson\u2019s 20%. There\u2019s been limited public polling on the race since, though two pro-Jackson groups have released surveys showing him with healthy leads in the contest. Democrats have no serious chance of winning the seat in November.\u00a0A Trump War That\u2019s Actually About WarTrump hasn\u2019t endorsed any of the major candidates in the GOP primary in Maine\u2019s 2nd Congressional District, but that hasn\u2019t stopped him from defining the race for the right to challenge Democratic Rep. Jared Golden in this swing district, which covers most of rural Maine.\u00a0There\u2019s an actual ideological battle occurring here: Libertarians who are skeptical of the national security state and foreign adventurism, including Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, are backing Eric Brakey, a former state senator, while more establishment forces are supporting former state Rep. Dale Crafts, who holds standard hawkish GOP foreign policy views. (A third candidate, Adrienne Bennett, who was a spokesperson for former GOP Gov. Paul LePage, has a chance to win but isn\u2019t playing a central role in the fight over foreign policy. She\u2019s described herself as a \u201cpro-Trump Republican.\u201d)\u00a0This split has led to ads not about whether the United States should withdraw troops from Afghanistan or shrink its overseas military footprint, but instead about recriminations about loyalty to Trump. The American Policy Fund, a super PAC that won\u2019t have to disclose its donors until after the election, is attacking Brakey for criticizing Trump during the 2016 race.\u201cHe compared Trump to Hillary Clinton and even talked about setting fire to Trump merchandise,\u201d a narrator says in the 30-second ad.Protect Freedom PAC, which supports Libertarian candidates, responded with an ad linking the group to former national security adviser John Bolton, a hawk who published a memoir in June detailing Trump\u2019s lack of foreign policy knowledge and unpreparedness for the presidency. (American Policy Fund and a super PAC run by Bolton have the same treasurer.)\u201cJohn Bolton lies about President Trump, and now Bolton\u2019s henchmen are doing the same thing to Trump conservative Eric Brakey,\u201d the narrator says.Public polling of the race is limited, and forecasting the three-way race is difficult because of Maine\u2019s ranked-choice voting rules.\u00a0The winner of the GOP race will have a strong chance of picking up the toss-up seat in November. Trump won the 2nd District by 10 percentage points in 2016, while Golden \u2015 a veteran and former staffer for Sen. Susan Collins, who is considered a strong candidate \u2015 won by just under 1,000 votes during the Democratic wave year of 2018."}, {"cover": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/RR4C6qhLKKG71gXux0yqwQ--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5f1636ab270000120ee671b8.jpg", "topic": "POLITICS", "title": "Joaquin Castro Wants Democrats To Chart A New Course On Foreign Policy", "author": "By Akbar Shahid Ahmed", "date": "July 21, 2020", "url": "https://search.huffpost.com/click/_ylt=AwrgDA_qEC1fdi0AdVtsBmVH;_ylu=X3oDMTByNWU4cGh1BGNvbG8DZ3ExBHBvcwMxBHZ0aWQDBHNlYwNzYw--/RV=2/RE=1596817770/RO=10/RU=https%3a%2f%2fwww.huffpost.com%2fentry%2fjoaquin-castro-house-foreign-affairs-chair-competition_n_5f16366cc5b651977c057e16/RK=2/RS=6L7uJOaQrlAqjfJ56jf3ELARGxk-", "keyword": "China and national Security", "website": "Huffpost", "subtitle": "The Texas representative seeks to assume control of a key committee overseeing national security.

Trump arrived there late Friday afternoon following an official visit earlier at U.S. Southern Command in nearby Doral.Taking six-figure donations is no longer at all unusual for Trump.A HuffPost analysis of Federal Election Commission data from Jan. 20, 2017, through May 30, 2020, shows that during Trump\u2019s presidency, the Republican National Committee has collected a total of $130.4 million from the 555 donors who have given the party at least $100,000 each. Among them: Elizabeth Uihlein, the president of Wisconsin\u2019s Uline Inc., who has given $1,382,600; longtime Washington, D.C., lobbyist C. Boyden Gray, who has given $1,033,000; and Charles Schwab of the Charles Schwab Corp., who has given $576,300.Trump\u2019s official super PAC, America First Action, has collected $75.3 million from 90 such six-figure donors, including $10 million from Tim Mellon of Saratoga, Wyoming; $8 million from Geoffrey Palmer of Beverly Hills, California; and $5 million each from longtime Republican donors Sheldon and Miriam Adelson of Las Vegas.As he started running for president in 2015, Trump said that the system of accepting large donations was corrupt and that he knew this personally because he could make politicians do \u201cwhatever the hell\u201d he wanted by donating to their campaigns.At the first Republican presidential primary debate in Cleveland that August, Trump claimed: \u201cI gave to many people before this. Before two months ago, I was a businessman. I give to everybody. When they call, I give. And do you know what? When I need something from them two years later, three years later, I call them \u2015 they are there for me.\u201dAfter winning the nomination, Trump claimed he would \u201cdrain the swamp\u201d if he became president. He has repeated that claim through his years in office, even while appointing Cabinet heads who have rolled back environmental and worker safety regulations at the request of campaign donors and signed onto a tax cut package that disproportionately benefited the donor class.\u201cFrom inside deal-making to campaign solicitations, from appointing a lobbyist Cabinet to maintaining business interests and pursuing policies that benefit them, Donald Trump has overseen the most corrupt administration in American history,\u201d said Robert Weissman, president of the liberal watchdog group Public Citizen. \u201cUnder Donald Trump, the swamp has won. Trump has disrupted the standards of etiquette in political Washington, but he has perfected the standards of corruption.\u201dTrump\u2019s actual campaign, like all federal campaign committees, cannot accept donations larger than $5,600 per election cycle. The big money for his re-election bid comes from donations to the Republican Party, which because of revised rules can take as much as $355,000 per person per year, for each of the four years of a presidential election cycle, so that a four-year total of $1.42 million is possible per donor.Super PACs are not limited at all in the size of the donations they can accept from individuals or companies, although they legally cannot coordinate with the candidates or campaigns they are boosting.The RNC did not respond to HuffPost queries about its large-dollar donors.Its leaders, however, have routinely boasted in public statements about how they have raised far more money than the Democratic National Committee.The HuffPost analysis shows that the 17,165 donors who gave at least $1,000 to the RNC in a single donation gave the party a total of $246,743,344 \u2015 for an average of $14,375 per person.For Democrats, the 13,851 donors who gave at least $1,000 to the DNC in any single donation contributed a total of $106,160,289 \u2015 for an average of $7,664 per person.Trump campaign senior adviser Jason Miller would not say what GOP donors expect to get for their money \u2013 even though just a few years ago Trump himself said that getting something was the only reason they were giving. Instead, Miller accused presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden and his son Hunter of corruption.\u201cJoe Biden is one of the most corrupt politicians in American history,\u201d Miller said. \u201cHe flew his son Hunter to China on Air Force Two and helped him leave with $1.5 billion for his investment fund, and that\u2019s just the beginning for \u2018Biden, Inc.\u2019 Joe Biden\u2019s special interest is communist China.\u201dAccording to many presidential historians, though, Trump is by far the most corrupt president in modern times. He has funneled millions of both taxpayer dollars and campaign donor dollars into the cash registers of his own businesses \u2015 at one point even awarding the G-7 conference to his own resort, which would have brought him tens of millions of dollars, but then backtracking because of criticism. Trump begged China\u2019s dictator to help him win reelection by promising to buy large amounts of American farm products, according to his former national security adviser John Bolton,\u00a0and Trump was impeached for trying to extort Ukraine\u2019s leader into helping his reelection bid by announcing that Ukraine would investigate Biden.Further, Trump\u2019s campaign manager is paying the wife of one Trump son and the girlfriend of another $180,000 a year each, through his own private firm, to avoid reporting those payments on FEC filings.\u201cDonald Trump gave the Chinese government a pass and echoed their propaganda to justify his appalling inaction as the worst public health crisis in a century exploded,\u201d said Biden campaign spokesman Andrew Bates. \u201cAnd he did so because he cared more about a worthless reelection talking point regarding trade than he did about over 130,000 American lives or tens of millions of jobs.\u201d"}, {"cover": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/MvxGEP86gy2oju19vxGKQA--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5f0319ba2700001706e6650b.jpg", "topic": "POLITICS", "title": "Trump's Leadership Is Tested In Time Of Fear, Pandemic", "author": "By Paige Lavender", "date": "July 6, 2020", "url": "https://search.huffpost.com/click/_ylt=Awr9DuP2EC1fcQUApx5sBmVH;_ylu=X3oDMTByNWU4cGh1BGNvbG8DZ3ExBHBvcwMxBHZ0aWQDBHNlYwNzYw--/RV=2/RE=1596817782/RO=10/RU=https%3a%2f%2fwww.huffpost.com%2fentry%2ftrump-coronavirus-pandemic_n_5f03193ac5b612083c5f2936/RK=2/RS=IxqTurCkpTPhvFr9m5nlyp6_AN8-", "keyword": "China and national Security", "website": "Huffpost", "subtitle": "The Trump show may be losing its allure, exposing the empty space once filled by the empathy and seriousness of presidents leading in a crisis.", "content": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Not long after noon on Feb. 6, President Donald Trump strode into the elegant East Room of the White House. The night before,\u00a0his impeachment trial had ended with acquittal\u00a0in the Republican-controlled Senate. It was time to gloat and settle scores.\u201cIt was evil,\u201d Trump said of the attempt to end his presidency. \u201cIt was corrupt. It was dirty cops. It was leakers and liars.\u201dIt was also soon forgotten. On Feb. 6, in California, a 57-year-old woman was found dead in her home of natural causes then unknown. When her autopsy report came out, officials said her death had been the first from\u00a0COVID-19\u00a0in the U.S.The \u201cinvisible enemy\u201d was on the move. And civil unrest over\u00a0racial injustice\u00a0would soon claw at the country. If that were not enough, there came a fresh round of angst over Russia, and America would ask whether Trump had the backs of\u00a0troops targeted by bounty hunters\u00a0in Afghanistan.For Trump, the virus has been the most persistent of those problems. But he has not even tried to make a common health crisis the subject of national common ground and serious purpose. He has\u00a0refused to wear a mask, setting off a culture war in the process as his followers took their cues from him.Instead he spoke about preening with a mask when the cameras were off: \u201cI had a mask on,\u201d he said this past week. \u201cI sort of liked the way I looked ... like the Lone Ranger.\u201dThese are times of pain, mass death, fear and deprivation and the Trump show may be losing its allure, exposing the empty space once filled by the empathy and seriousness of presidents leading in a crisis.Bluster isn\u2019t beating the virus; belligerence isn\u2019t calming a restive nation.Angry and scornful at every turn, Trump used the totems of\u00a0Mount Rushmore as his backdrop\u00a0to play on the country\u2019s racial divisions, denouncing the \u201cbad, evil people\u201d behind protests for racial justice. He then made\u00a0a steamy Fourth of July salute to America\u00a0on the White House South Lawn his platform to assail \u201cthe radical left, the anarchists, the agitators, the looters,\u201d and, for good measure, people with \u201cabsolutely no clue.\u201d\u201cIf he could change, he would,\u201d said Cal Jillson, a presidential scholar at Southern Methodist University in Dallas. \u201cIt\u2019s not helping him now. It\u2019s just nonstop. It is habitual and incurable. He is who he is.\u201dOver three and a half years Trump exhausted much of the country, while exhilarating some of it, with his constant brawls, invented realities, outlier ways and pop-up dramas of his own making. Into summer, one could wonder whether Trump had finally exhausted even himself.Vainglorious always, Trump recently let down that front long enough to ponder the possibility that he could lose in November, not from the fabricated voting shenanigans he likes to warn about but simply because the country may not want him after all of this.\u201cSome people don\u2019t love me,\u201d he allowed.\u201cMaybe.\u201d___VICTORY LAPOn Feb. 5 in the White House residence, Trump had watched all the Republican senators, save Mitt Romney of Utah, dutifully vote to acquit, ending the third impeachment trial in U.S. history.His rambling, angry, 62-minute remarks the next day were meant to air out grievances and unofficially launch Trump\u2019s reelection bid \u2014 with the crucible of impeachment behind him, his so-so approval ratings unharmed, Republicans unified and the economy roaring.The president\u2019s advisers also watched, relieved that the shadow of impeachment \u2014 which loomed first due to Russia\u2019s U.S. election interference, then his Ukraine machinations \u2014 was now behind them, letting them focus on the reelection battle ahead.The plan was taking shape: a post-trial barnstorming tour, rallies meant to compete with the Democratic primaries and a chance for the president to dive into the reelection fight that had animated so many of his decisions thus far in his term, according to some of the 10 current and former administration and campaign officials who requested anonymity to speak candidly for this story.A few days earlier, the first coronavirus death outside China had been recorded, in the Philippines. Known cases of the disease in the U.S. were under a dozen. The U.S. had declared a public health emergency and restricted travel to and from China. But this was not something Trump wanted to talk about in the glow of acquittal and fog of grievance, and events had not yet forced his hand.The day was meant to mark a new chapter in Trump\u2019s presidency. It did. But not the one the president and his people expected.___THE LONGEST DAYTrump\u2019s whirlwind trip to India was meant to be a celebration and in some ways was. He addressed a rally crowd of 100,000 and visited the Taj Mahal.But in a quick talk to business people at the U.S. ambassador\u2019s residence, he felt compelled to address the virus, which had begun rattling the foundation for his argument for another four years in office: the economy.Fighting jet lag and anxiety about a dive in the stock market, Trump was up much of the previous night on the phone with advisers, peppering them with questions about the potential economic fallout of the outbreak, according to the officials who spoke with The Associated Press.\u201cWe lost almost 1,000 points yesterday on the market, and that\u2019s something,\u201d Trump told the two dozen or so business leaders. \u201cThings like that happen where \u2014 and you have it in your business all the time \u2014 it had nothing to do with you; it\u2019s an outside source that nobody would have ever predicted.\u201dThe virus was \u201ca problem that\u2019s going to go away,\u201d he said. \u201cOur country is under control.\u201dBut the markets fell again the next day, creating their biggest two-day slide in four years. When Trump boarded Air Force One well after sundown in India, he was in a rage about the virus and his inability to slow the market tumble with reassuring words, according to the officials.Trump barely slept on the plane as it hurtled back to Washington overnight, landing early in the morning Feb. 26 after more than a dozen hours in the air, creating the effect of one endless day. He then quickly tore into aides about Nancy Messonnier, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, who had publicly predicted that the virus\u2019 impact would be severe.It was already too late to pretend otherwise, not that Trump stopped trying. Warning signs had been missed. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention failed in an early attempt at a coronavirus test. Trump had refused to turn up the pressure on China for fear of alienating Xi Jinping and scuttling a trade deal.His conventional weapons failed him. The virus doesn\u2019t have a Twitter account.\u201cTrump was elected to burn down the system and entertain,\u201d said Eric Dezenhall, a crisis-management consultant who has followed Trump\u2019s business, TV and political careers.\u201cWhen things get terrible, people don\u2019t want a leader to burn down the system and entertain. We actually want a system. And you can\u2019t bully a disease, which has been his one maneuver for 74 years.\u201dThe president returned to the West Wing to watch the market fall yet again and told aides that, later that day, he would take the podium and preside over the coronavirus task force briefing for the first time. This would become a daily ritual for Trump to try to force his belief that the virus was under control even as infections surged and the death toll mounted.The virus was not the only exterior event shaping his week. Three days later, Joe Biden began his remarkable political comeback by trouncing Bernie Sanders in the South Carolina Democratic primary.Trump\u2019s assumption that he would be running on the back of a strong economy against a socialist had been flipped on its head.Coronavirus cases were about to soar.___THE BRIEFINGAt an April 23 briefing that would live in infamy and make some comedy careers, Trump wasn\u2019t really listening. By this day about 50,000 Americans had died from COVID-19.Trump has long had trouble focusing in meetings, hearing one piece of information and often going off on tangents, frequently a memory from his time in New York real estate.Instead, he focused on the televised briefings and relished his jousting with reporters. He scheduled them for the late afternoon or early evening and would tell aides and confidants about the huge ratings they\u2019d get, according to the officials.The briefings would often stretch more than an hour, the vital health information from public health officials often drowned out by Trump\u2019s attacks on the media and insistence that the pandemic was under control when, in late April, it decidedly was not.Trump\u2019s aides had already begun counseling the president to scale back or stop altogether his appearances at the briefings, nervously watching polls that found his scattershot performances were eroding support, particularly among older people, the group most vulnerable to COVID-19.Trump refused. He told aides that his successes in politics were from dominating the stage and he was not going to give that up, particularly when his beloved campaign rallies were suspended and he couldn\u2019t run the race against Biden that he wanted.But in the task force meeting that April 23, Trump only somewhat heard or understood a discussion about a study detailing the use of light and disinfectants to help kill the coronavirus on surfaces.He then began a dialogue with William Bryan, acting head of science at the Department of Homeland Security, who said the \u201cvirus dies quickest in sunlight.\u201d Trump had a thought or two about that.\u201cSo supposing we hit the body with a tremendous \u2014 whether it\u2019s ultraviolet or just a very powerful light \u2014 and I think you said that hasn\u2019t been checked because of the testing,\u201d Trump said in a helpful tone. \u201cAnd then I said, supposing you brought the light inside the body, which you can do either through the skin or some other way, and I think you said you\u2019re going to test that, too.\u201d\u201cThen I see the disinfectant,\u201d he continued, even more perilously. \u201cKnocks it out in a minute.\u201d Perhaps an \u201cinjection inside or almost a cleaning.\u201d\u201cIt would be interesting to check that.\u201dThe uproar was instantaneous, the White House\u2019s attempted cleanup futile. Soon, the briefings would be canceled, the president surrendering his pulpit in the midst of sinking poll numbers and growing questions about his fitness for the job.What might have worked for Trump before the pandemic stopped working as the death toll mounted and the president looked increasingly out of his element, Jillson said.\u201cPeople would watch Trump and see the instability ... the emergencies of his own making he would then claim to have taken care of, and be mildly entertained or at least not deeply worried,\u201d he said. But now? \u201cA lot of that \u2018Am I still amused?\u2019 quickly gets to a \u2019No\u2019 answer.\u201cYou\u2019re never going to come out a major natural disaster unscathed but you can mitigate the damage by an empathetic response that describes the path out of this. That\u2019s what Trump is literally incapable of doing.\u201d___THE BUNKERThe chants could be heard inside the White House residence.George Floyd, a Black man, had died under the knee of a white Minneapolis police officer, igniting several nights of protests in the Twin Cities. Trump had said little about the death but was quick to denounce the violence that accompanied some of the demonstrations. \u201cWhen the looting starts, the shooting starts,\u201d he tweeted, a threat flagged by the social media company and pilloried by Democrats because it reprised the language of a racist Miami police chief in the 1960s.That Friday afternoon, May 29, as racial unrest now gripped the country and the virus death toll stood at more than 100,000, Trump spoke to reporters from the Rose Garden about China. He did not mention Floyd\u2019s name.That night, the protests reached Trump\u2019s front yard.Thousands of people descended on Lafayette Square, clashing with law enforcement and overwhelming the security perimeter hastily set up just a few hundred yards from the front fencing of the White House. The size and energy of the protest had caught the Secret Service off guard and Trump, along with members of his immediate family, were rushed to an underground bunker, usually used to protect presidents during possible terrorist attacks.The president\u2019s tweeting continued, threatening a further crackdown against the protests, which he depicted as unlawful even though the vast majority were peaceful. When the bunker story became public, Trump reacted in a rage, screaming at aides to find the leaker, whom he deemed a traitor, and angry that it made him look weak, according to the officials. In the days that followed, Trump argued unconvincingly that he was only in the bunker to inspect it.It was that anger \u2014 and a reflexive desire to align himself with law enforcement even when polling indicated widespread support for the protests \u2014 that led Trump to make one of the defining decisions of his term. He authorized the clearing of the square so he could walk across to the nearby \u201cChurch of the Presidents,\u201d which was damaged during the protests, and hold up a Bible.The photo op went terribly wrong. Democrats likened it to the actions of an authoritarian while Republicans dissociated themselves from the spectacle. Aides cast blame on each other and even Trump privately admitted that he did not expect the fierce blowback.Trump issued an executive order directing the government to establish a national database tracking police officers who lose their jobs for misconduct and freeing grant money to improve policing practices. With these steps, Trump \u201cturned justified anger into meaningful action,\u201d said deputy White House press secretary Sarah Matthews.She spoke of a \u201cwhole-of-America response to this pandemic\u201d that let states decide when and how to reopen and ensures \u201cthe federal government will be there to support states if needed.\u201dTrump\u2019s instinct, his ability to read a moment, had long been his strength as a politician. But from the bunker to the church to his increasingly lonely defense of Confederate monuments, he appeared out of step even with many Republicans on matters of race and in denial about the ravages of COVID-19.\u201cIn a crisis, when you lack an operational solution, all you are left with is humanity,\u201d Dezenhall said. \u201cThis is just a situation where Trump cannot pivot because he views empathy as the equivalent of running down Pennsylvania Avenue in high heels and a tutu.\u201d___THE SACRED AND THE PROFANEThe empty seats made him angry.The rally in Tulsa was supposed to signal his comeback, the first mega campaign event since the onset of the pandemic. It was to be a show of political defiance and force in deep-red Oklahoma, reassuring nervous Republicans.It didn\u2019t turn out that way.Despite campaign boasts of 1 million ticket requests, only slightly more than 6,000 people came to the indoor rally in a space holding 19,000. An overflow space went unused. Fears of the virus and protests kept many away. But the scant crowd also raised questions about whether the Trump show was wearing thin even with his supporters in red hats.It was June 20. The virus death toll was closing in on 120,000.The woebegone rally was part of a bet his campaign was making and still is. It\u2019s predicated on the belief that few voters who don\u2019t like Trump can be persuaded to swing behind him now, so success lies in motivating those who are still with him.The plan: First, drive up negative opinions about Biden, whom the Trump campaign believes is liked by perhaps 60% of the country, if tepidly.Second, on the theory that a largely unwavering 40% of the country likes the president, Trump would serve up policies and rhetoric to generate enough enthusiasm to turn out that slice of the country to vote.A key recent stop for that plan was Arizona, where Trump in 109-degree Yuma heat marked progress on the border wall central to his 2016 campaign.Then a speech at a Phoenix megachurch, a nod to evangelicals and a group of avid young Republicans. And when Trump looked out at the rows, he saw none of the empty seats that bedeviled him in Tulsa just three days earlier.Trump reveled in the crowd, speaking for more than 90 minutes and getting the in-person adulation he had been missing for months. He did not mention that his supporters in the church were placing themselves and others at risk by sitting close together and not wearing masks. Confirmed infections and hospitalizations in Arizona have hit daily records.The president boarded Air Force One in an ebullient mood, telling aides to return to scheduling rallies \u2014 perhaps in smaller venues than Tulsa, perhaps outside \u2014 that could soon again get him in front of a crowd, the officials said.No rallies have been held since Tulsa. One is coming up Saturday in New Hampshire, to be held outside at Portsmouth\u2019s airport. The virus has come roaring back in widespread parts of the country, pushing the death toll to about 130,000.White House counselor Kellyanne Conway acknowledged \u201cit\u2019s a new world\u201d because of the pandemic and many Trump supporters won\u2019t go to a traditional rally because it\u2019s \u201chigh risk, low reward for them,\u201d given that they already back the president.Nonetheless, Trump tried to entice the masses to his July Fourth event, drawing only a scattered crowd to the National Mall for an air show and fireworks while he remained at the White House, hosting several hundred invited guests on the South Lawn.There his angry words washed over the guests and ricocheted across the country.The people in front of him were said to be medical and other front-line workers in the pandemic and law enforcement. But he was speaking really to his most fervent supporters around the country, tapping the divide over race and culture and making it about us versus them \u2014 the leftists, the looters and the clueless.He cast himself as the defender of heritage and the \u201cAmerican way of life.\u201dHe wore no mask. But the Lone Ranger was riding again.____Associated Press writer Nancy Benac contributed to this report.\nA HuffPost Guide To Coronavirus\n\n7 essential pieces of relationship advice for couples in quarantine\nWhat you need to know about face masks right now\nHow to tell if you need to start doing online therapy\n\nLost your job due to coronavirus?

They detained the man, telling him the slogan was banned. But when officers looked at the poster up close, no words could be made out. It merely had circular shapes against a contrasting background. They snapped a few photographs of the poster and let him go.Since the imposition of the security law -\u2013 which bans secessionist, subversive and terrorist activities, as well as collusion with foreign forces, with penalties of up to life imprisonment -\u2013 anti-government protesters in Hong Kong, and those supporting the movement, have adapted their methods to try to make their voices heard without violating the legislation.Before the law took effect June 30, protesters often held up colorful posters plastered with slogans that ranged from condemning the Chinese government to calling for Hong Kong\u2019s independence. Since then, they have become creative in obscuring their messages.Many of the protesters at the luxury mall held up blank pieces of white paper to protest against China\u2019s \u201cwhite terror\u201d of political repression. Other posters are designed to circumvent bans on slogans. The government has not yet made clear if such forms of expression are illegal.The law has had a chilling effect on \u201cyellow shops\u201d that support the protest movement. Many have removed protest artwork and sticky notes bearing words of encouragement from customers, out of fear that they could land them in trouble with the authorities.Some shop owners, like Tan Wong, have instead put up blank sticky notes to show solidarity with the movement.\u201cWe are doing this right now because (the shop) is private property. We are trying to tell Hong Kong people that this is the only thing that we \u2018yellow shops\u2019 can do,\u201d said Wong, who runs Kok Kok Chicken, a Korean fried chicken store.\u201cIf we do not persist, we would no longer be able to deliver our message to others,\u201d he said.Yu Yee Cafe, a Hong Kong-style diner that serves fast food, has covered its windows with blank sticky notes and even displays an origami figure of Winnie the Pooh, a playful taunt of Chinese President Xi Jinping. Chinese censors briefly banned social media searches for Winnie the Pooh in China after Xi\u2019s appearance was compared to the cartoon bear.\u201cI wonder if there\u2019s still rule of law if sticking a (blank) piece of paper on the wall is illegal,\u201d said Eddie Tsui, one of the diner\u2019s customers. \u201cIt\u2019s just using a different way to express our demands. If you don\u2019t allow us to protest that way, we\u2019ll find another way.\u201dThe use of blank paper or sticky notes to protest is a changing form of resistance, according to Ma Ngok, an associate professor of politics at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.\u201cThey put up blank notes so that even if the government wants to prosecute them, there is nothing that can be used against them,\u201d he said.Protesters in Hong Kong have also come up with alternative slogans to circumvent the ban on \u201cLiberate Hong Kong, revolution of our times.\u201dSome users quote the initials of the romanization of the eight Chinese characters in the banned slogan -\u2013 \u201cGFHG, SDGM.\u201d Others have changed the words entirely to terms that sound similar but mean very different things. One alternative slogan now reads \u201cPatronize Hong Kong, Times Square,\u201d a reference to a popular shopping mall in the city.A popular protest anthem, \u201cGlory to Hong Kong,\u201d has had some of its lyrics changed, with protesters replacing the words with numbers in Cantonese that sound approximately like the lyrics.The circumventing of bans on slogans is reminiscent of how mainland Chinese internet users come up with creative ways and similar-sounding words to talk about sensitive issues without triggering censorship under the \u201cGreat Firewall of China,\u201d where censors delete posts containing sensitive terms and make such keywords unsearchable on online platforms.\u201cThere is a long history of censorship where we know that people will find ways to circumvent the system, no matter how you regulate,\u201d said Fu King-wa, associate professor at the University of Hong Kong\u2019s journalism school.\u201cSometimes, censorship can backfire, triggering more people to discuss an issue because they think that if it is censored, then it must be something important,\u201d he said.___Associated Press journalist Alice Fung contributed to this report."}, {"cover": "https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/GviGpGvBm_G1TVtFoox3sA--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD05MjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT04MDt3PTE2NA--/https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5f0c8141220000ec08386e78.jpg", "topic": "POLITICS", "title": "Trump Suggests A Biden Presidency Would Be 'Ratings' Nightmare", "author": "By Jenna Amatulli", "date": "July 14, 2020", "url": "https://search.huffpost.com/click/_ylt=Awr9DukYES1fZccAy.NsBmVH;_ylu=X3oDMTByNWU4cGh1BGNvbG8DZ3ExBHBvcwMxBHZ0aWQDBHNlYwNzYw--/RV=2/RE=1596817817/RO=10/RU=https%3a%2f%2fwww.huffpost.com%2fentry%2ftrump-ratings-biden-presidency_n_5f0c766bc5b6480493d34439/RK=2/RS=OspR_cTA20RPJpTvQ3qQbtJ6NYY-", "keyword": "China and national Security", "website": "Huffpost", "subtitle": "The president insisted that if Joe Biden wins in November, the \u201cmedia will go down along with our great USA!\u201d", "content": "President Donald Trump warned his social media followers that a Joe Biden presidency could mean \u201cno ratings,\u201d and asked: \u201cIs this what you want for your President???\u201dTrump, in a familiar Monday morning Twitter tear, quote-tweeted a video of Biden shared by White House social media aide Dan Scavino.

Users boasted they were in part responsible for a largely empty arena because they flooded Trump\u2019s campaign site with fake requests for tickets to the event.The retaliation against Trump got a boost Wednesday when popular TikTok user DeJuan Booker (@unusualbeing) called his 750,000 followers to action, Bloomberg was the first to report. He explained how to ding the Trump campaign app with a single-star rating.\u201cGen Z don\u2019t go down without a fight,\u201d he told his followers. \u201cLet\u2019s go to war.\u201c\u00a0The app had a feeble 1.2 rating average from 227,000 reviews on the Apple store as of Thursday night. \u201cHorrible president, horrible app,\u201d noted one review among a sea of one-star ratings.Another read: \u201cOMG PLZ DON\u2019T DOWNLOAD.\u201d Another bashed the app, adding: \u201cI promise this isn\u2019t another one of those \u2018tik tok\u2019 reviews.\u201d\u00a0The TikTokkers hope the bad reviews will persuade Apple to remove the campaign app, but unpopularity isn\u2019t enough to delete an app, according to Bloomberg. Still, the scathing reviews make for interesting reading.Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Monday that the Trump administration was considering a ban on Chinese social media apps, especially TikTok,\u00a0because of concerns about privacy and security. He told Americans not to download the TikTok app unless they want their private information to fall into \u201cthe hands of the Chinese Communist Party.\u201d Trump contradicted him the following day with his comment about punishing China over COVID-19.The zoomer generation was suspicious about the threatened action.\u201cI don\u2019t believe Trump is trying to take TikTok away because of national security, but more to retaliate against activism on the app and all the videos about him that drag him through the mud,\u201d Darius Jackson, an 18-year-old TikTok user in Illinois, told Bloomberg. He also asked his followers to give the app a one-star rating.Meanwhile, a popular comedian who lip-syncs Trump comments will be able to post her sketches on her go-to app as long as it lasts. Sarah Cooper\u2019s latest jab against the president is called \u201cHow to Mask.\u201d"}]
